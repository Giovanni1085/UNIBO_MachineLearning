Partiality ; prejudice ; want of perspective ; inattention to, or ignorance of, important phases of character ; exagge- ration of details ; neglect of essentials ; haste ; inaccu- racy ; and other latent causes of error abound. The tendency, I think, of the present day is to make biography err on the side of indiscriminate panegyric. There is much analogy in several respects between writing a life of an individual and writing an account of a colony. Perhaps the most fertile cause of error in this latter case is, more or less, incompleteness of view on the part of the writer. This defect may be caused by partiality or prejudice, but it too often arises from want of knowledge. Personal observation has been too hurried, and has led to the adoption, without proper inquiry, of second-hand statements, one-sided and misleading. The ablest man cannot possibly write a good account of a colony, on informa- tion acquired during a flying visit of a month, or thereabouts ; and, even in narrating what he saw and heard, he will probably lead his readers to false a 3"], [12, "PREFACE. VI conclusions. He is in fact, in many cases, himself deceived. Things seen and heard, when seen and heard by themselves, apart from other things, often cause grave misapprehension. A passenger in a metropolitan omnibus could as well, judging only from what he saw and heard around him, write a correct account of London and of its institutions, as a visitor for a few weeks to New Zealand could, from what he saw and heard during the time, write a correct account of that colony. The author may be thoroughly impartial and eminently clever, but, without knowledge of all facts, and without careful study of them in all aspects, the description which he gives would, if accepted as a complete picture, be essentially incorrect. What he writes may abound in literary merit and be very popular, but it would only on that account be the more mischievous as it would the more effectively and widely disseminate error. Again, supposing that the writer is qualified, as is often the case, by competent knowledge and ability, we often find, among books on New Zealand, that he devotes himself to some special part of the whole subject, and that he addresses himself to a particular class of readers. What generally is wanted, in the case of New Zealand, is a simple and compre hensive account of it, faithfully representing its con dition, its resources, and its capabilities ; combining, as far as practicable, the many varied features of an intricate picture in due proportion to each other; and, as it were, reproducing it, in miniature, as a whole and as it is.

New Zealand, from early days, was adapted for colonisa tion. The country was sparsely inhabited by a barbarous race. Animal life was rare ; and there was a total absence of wild beasts and noxious reptiles. Geographical position, and the physical features of the land, made the climate temperate, varied, and eminently salubrious. The pos session of numerous good harbours and of other maritime advantages was specially conducive to future commercial prosperity. The capabilities of the country were very great. There was untold industrial wealth latent in its vegetation, its timber, its minerals, its varieties of soil, its suitability for pastoral, agricultural, and manufacturing purposes, and in its fisheries. Picturesque scenery of diversified character abounded in its mountains, its valleys, its forests, its lakes, and its running streams. Everything pointed to a great future of colonisation and of civilised life. New Zealand lies in the Pacific Ocean, between the parallels of 34\u00b0 and 47\u00b0 south latitude and the meridians of 166\u00b0 and 178\u00b0 east longitude, and is surrounded by the greatest extent of ocean in the globe. Two islands, now"], [20, "2 AREA \u2014 NORTH ISLAND. best known respectively as the North Island and the South Island, practically constitute New Zealand. There is a small island at the southern extremity, called Stewart Island. New Zealand is to the south-eastward of, and at least 1000 miles from Australia. The corresponding latitudes in the northern hemisphere extend from Central France over Italy and Sicily into Northern Africa. The area of the three islands is upwards of 100,000 square miles, or about one-sixth less than that of Great Britain and Ireland; the length is about 1100 miles; the breadth varies from 46 to 160 miles, but no part is anywhere more distant than 75 miles from the sea-coast. The North Island and the South Island are separated from each other by Cook Strait, which is navigable, and is in its narrowest part about 12 miles across ; in other parts, ranging in breadth from 50 to 100 miles. The area of the South Island is about the same as that of England and Wales ; and that of the North Island is about one-fourth less. The coast line is over 3000 miles, and is indented by many good harbours. The geological structure of the islands is chiefly volcanic. The North Island was for the most part covered with mountains and forests, and intersected by swamps, rivers, and tidal creeks. Inland communication was impracticable, except by difficult and tortuous native paths and in native canoes. One of the most remarkable features in the North Island, compensating, as it were, for the serious obstacles to inter-communication on land, consists in an extensive natural system of internal navigable waters. In the more northern part of the western side, there are the large navigable estuaries of Kaipara and Wairoa, forming one of the most extensive inlets in New Zealand. Five miles within the Kaipara Heads, four large rivers converge, flowing from different directions from far inland; a narrow isthmus divides the head of the navigable waters of the Kaipara, one of these four rivers, from the inlet of Waitemata on the east coast ; this inlet is part of the Hauraki Gulf, into which two long rivers, navigable for canoes, run from the southern interior ; and it is also divided by a narrow isthmus, across which, as between Kaipara and Waitemata, canoes were easily carried, from the estuary of Manukau. Manukau is an extensive inlet"], [21, "3 NORTH ISLAND \u2014 RIVERS \u2014 FORESTS. opening into the sea on the west coast, with extensive ramifications inland; one branch is only divided by a narrow portage for canoes from the river Waikato, which, in its turn, runs a course of 200 miles from Lake Taupo, a lake, about thirty miles long and twenty miles broad, in the centre of the North Island. The Waipa, a large tributary to the Waikato, gives access to the more westerly interior. To the south- westward of Lake Taupo, there are several large rivers. The Wanganui rises near that lake and is about 120 miles long ; the Wangaehu has its source in the Taupo plains, and flows to the west coast a little to the south of the Wanganui. There are also the rivers Rangitikei and Manawatu ; the latter river is remarkable in that it penetrates a high dividing range between the east and west coasts, and practically anni hilates what would otherwise be an almost impassable barrier to transinsular communication. There are also, at the extreme south of the island, the deep inlets of Porirua and of what is now the harbour of Wellington. These characteristic natural features in the North Island constitute a notable provision for facilitating future colonisation, by bringing together many parts of thp country, remote from each other and otherwise inaccessible. Vast forests overshadowed the island. There is a fascina tion in New Zealand forests, which is felt, but cannot be adequately expressed. Almost all New Zealand trees are evergreen ; and in these forests successive growths of noble trees uplift their lofty stems, entwined and interlaced by innumerable creepers, while at their feet the luxuriant undergrowth forms a tangled and almost impenetrable jungle. The silence and solitude are palpable ; the sky is unseen ; the circle of vision is limited to a few feet, and the sombre vegetation, closely packed together, adds to the overhanging and surrounding gloom. The whole scene fascinates the sense, and inspires admiration and awe. Occasional glades refresh the eye and relieve the mental oppression. The feeling of close confinement passes away ; the light of day brightens everything ; the sono- of birds is again heard ; the meandering stream, which lately murmured invisibly, is seen ; and the palm like tree-fern, the Nikau, the cabbage-tree, heavy masses of foliage lightened by blossoms of various tints, and"], [22, "4 NORTH ISLAND \u2014 VOLCANIC REGION. varieties of graceful ferns, in all their prim\u00e6val loveliness, shine like gems in each oasis of the forest. Ranges of lofty mountains occupy the central part of the North Island, and towards the coast the low lands were covered with ferns and flax, and were thickly dotted with large and dangerous swamps. Besides the wonderful natural network of internal navigable waters, which exists in the North Island, another remarkable feature was seen in its central active volcanic region. From White Island, which is an active volcano in the Bay of Plenty on the east coast, twenty-eight miles from shore, a continuous belt of subterraneous agitation extends in a south-westerly course, about 150 miles long and about thirty broad, through the lakes Rotorua and Rotomahana to the base of the lofty mountains Ruapehu and Tongariro, the latter itself being also in a state of volcanic activity. Throughout this belt there are innumerable geysers and hot springs, emitting clouds of sulphurous steam; and within it were comprised the indescribably wonderfnl and beautiful white and pink terraces of Rotomahana, now, alas ! no longer in existence, volcanic action in 1886 having caused their total destruction. They are gone, aud their marvellous beauties only live in the faithful records of eye-witnesses. The extent of coast line in the North Island is nearly 1500 miles ; and by far the greater number of its harbours are included between the North Cape and Cape Colville on the east coast, the east point of the gulf of Hauraki. The harbours on the west coast have shifting sands and bars at their entrances. The South Island is in area about the size of England and Wales, and is, like the North Island, chiefly of vol canic formation ; but it contains a far greater extent of plains and open lands. A lofty and massive mountain range runs, close to the west coast, throughout the entire length of the island ; the highest peak, Mount Cook, has an altitude of 12,349 feet. From either coast, these Southern Alps, as they are called, towering here and there in glistening peaks of snow, present magnificent aspects ; and within the range itself lies hidden romantic and picturesque scenery in rich profusion. On the eastern side, extensive plains intervene between the base of the range and the ocean ; the more precipitous western slopes"], [23, "5 SOUTH ISLAND \u2014 SOUNDS \u2014 NEW ZEALAND. are clothed with dense forests. The harbours in the South Island in their general features resemble the harbours in the North Island. There is, however, an exceptional feature at the south-western extremity of the South Island. Along that part of the coast, for a distance of 120 miles, there are thirteen deep inlets, or sounds, some of which run twenty miles inland, with a depth of water generally exceeding a hundred fathoms, and surrounded by high and precipitous mountains, rising almost perpendicularly from the water's edge to an elevation of from 3000 to 5000 feet, clothed with impenetrable forest. These sounds are unrivalled in their sublime grandeur, their picturesque scenery, and their majestic isolation. Stewart Island is a small island to the south, and is separated from the mainland by Foveaux Strait, which is about fifteen miles in general width. The island is about 120 miles in circumference, is generally mountainous and thickly wooded, and possesses several excellent har bours. This brief sketch of the physical character of the islands of New Zealand shows how wonderfully they are adapted to the occupation of civilised man. The twofold insular position, the great proportion of coast line, the numerous harbours and roadsteads, the extensive area of internal navigable waters in the island, in which intercommuni cation on land is most difficult, all point to a future of maritime and commercial greatness under favourable con ditions. I have as yet merely sketched the country as it was seen, or as it could have been seen had time and opportunity been favourable, in its great external and internal distinctive features, before the commencement of colonisation. Its great variety of latent industrial wealth, awaiting development by the labour of man, will gradually appear as the account of its colonisation proceeds. I give now a short epitome of the geological structure and of the natural history of New Zealand. The ma terials used by me for this purpose are chiefly culled from the works of Dr. Thomson, the Rev. James Buller, his son, Sir Walter Buller, K.C.M.G., and Sir James Hector, K.C.M.G., Director of the Geological Survey of New Zealand. The following classification has been adopted in the"], [24, "6 NEW ZEALAND \u2014 GEOLOGY. construction of geological maps of New Zealand ; but the difficulties attendant on this work render any attempt to express the observed results in a systematic form merely provisional : \u2014 Post-Teetiaet (Recent). \u2014 The deposits belonging to this period have accumulated with great rapidity in New Zealand, owing to the mountainous character of the country, and to the consequent nature of the rivers, which, even when of large size, have the character of torrents, and are liable to floods of great violence. To some extent, also, the remarkable indications of change which are everywhere manifest are attributable to changes of relative level, which have affected the surface, both on the sea-coast and inland. Pliocene. \u2014 This formation belongs to a period when New Zealand was the mountain range of a greatly extended land-area, and when, in the North Island, the volcanic forces had their greatest activity, attended with the rapid elevation of local areas of fossiliferous deposits that were at this period forming in adjacent seas. In the South Island no marine deposits of importance belonging to the period are present, but the great area of land above the shore-line intensified the erosive action of the glaciers radiating from the mountain centres, and gave rise to enormous deposits of gravel on the lower lands. Uppee Miocene. \u2014 The marine beds of this age consist of sandy, calcareous, and argillaceous strata, the distribu tion and general character of which indicate their relation to a closely adjacent shore-line. Lower Miocene. \u2014 This formation, which is distinguished from the Upper Miocene by fossils, is a calcareous and argillaceous formation, widely spread over the east and central part of the North Island, and on both sides of the South Island ; and, when not removed by denudation, can be traced to an altitude of 2500 feet above the sea. It represents a period of great depression ; and the deposits are remarkable for the absence of evidence of volcanic activity in any part of the region, and for the abundance of marine life. Upper Eocene. \u2014 This is a very marked formation of calcareous sandstone composed of shell fragments, with corals and Bryozoa, and a shallow- water and littoral"], [25, "7 NEW ZEALAND \u2014 GEOLOGY. deposit. Intense volcanic activity prevailed during this period in both islands. CRETACEO-TERTlARr. \u2014 The distribution of this formation shows that it was not, like the foregoing formations of later date, deposited in relation to a form of the land like that at present existing in the New Zealand area, except in the vicinity of some of the oldest and most lofty land-masses in the south, which appear to have remained above the water-line since the Lower Cretaceous period. The most valuable coal deposits of New Zealand occur in the Cretaceo-Tertiary formation, but always at the base of the marine beds of the formation. Lower Geeensand. \u2014 This formation consists of green and grey incoherent sandstones, with hard concretions and large masses of silicified wood ; and is also very rich in fossils of the genera Belemnites and Tirgonia, with a few Saurian bones and large Chim\u00e6roid fishes. Jurassic. \u2014 These beds, which are the youngest of the Lower Secondary formation in New Zealand, consist in the upper part of estuarine beds, marine fossils being absent or rare. Lias. \u2014 This formation consists, in its upper part, of conglomerates and sandy grits, with plant-remains too indistinct for identification. Trias. \u2014 It has been found necessary to include in this formation a thickness of strata which is quite unusual in other parts of the world ; but the close connection which exists throughout, founded on both pal\u00e6onto logical and stratigraphical grounds, and the clearly defined Permian character of the next underlying formation renders this classification necessary. Peemian. \u2014 The mineral character of this formation is grey and green sandstone, with breccia and heavy conglomerate beds. Marine fossils have only been found at 1000 feet below the great conglomerate that divides its two sections. Lower Carboniferous and Upper Devonian. \u2014 This for mation is of considerable importance, from the large share it takes in the structure of the great mountain ranges, and from the occasionally great development in it of contemporaneous igneous rocks, with which are associated metalliferous deposits."], [26, "8 NEW ZEALAND \u2014 GEOLOGY. Lower Devonian. \u2014 These, as determined by their fossil contents, have only been distinguished in one locality in the South Island, although from their mineral character they are evidently present in many other parts of it. Upper Silurian. \u2014 The Upper Silurian rocks consist of grey cherts, sandstones, and calcareous slates, with occasional beds of blue limestone. Lower Silurian. \u2014 These rocks form the mass of the mountain range on the north-eastern end of the South Island, and they consist chiefly of a dark bituminous slate, associated with a blue or grey submetamorphic limestone, which is in places largely developed. White crystalline limestones are also associated with these beds. The whole series is disturbed by eruptive hornblendic and syenitic rocks, which are probably of Devonian age. Fossils have been found in two localities only, and these consist entirely of encrinite remains, one species of coral not yet deter mined, and Graptolites which occur in the slates. The central axis of these beds consists of true mica schists, to the east and west of which the limestone and bituminous slates overlie. Foliated Schists. \u2014 The metamorphic rocks under this head have, as yet, been only subdivided according to their mineral character ; but they probably consist chiefly of altered Silurian rocks, and even those of formations as young as the Lower Carboniferous beds. The less meta morphosed areas of Lower Pal\u00e6ozoic rocks in the south of New Zealand have yielded no fossils. Crystalline Schists and Granite. \u2014 The south-western portion of the South Island is composed of crystalline rocks, forming lofty and rugged mountains, of which the chief characteristic is their cubical form, due to their being intersected in all directions by deep but narrow valleys, with abrupt precipitous sides to three-fourths of the extreme height of the adjacent mountains. The valleys are occupied on the west by arms of the sea, and on the east by those of inland lakes that resemble the Norwegian fiords, and present most wonderful mountain scenery. The base rock of this formation is foliated and contorted gneiss, corresponding to Humboldt's gneiss-granite of South America, and associated with it are granite, syenite, and diorite, which belong to the next group. Wrapping"], [27, "9 NEW ZEALAND \u2014 GEOLOGY. round these crystalline strata, and sometimes rising to an altitude of 5000 feet on its surface, is a series of horn blende schists, soft, micaceous, and amphibolic gneiss, clay-slate, and quartzites, associated with felstone dykes, serpentine, and granular limestone. Dr. Hector believes these latter to be metamorphic rocks, of not very ancient date, probably of Devonian age. Areas within the crys talline schists, where true granite occurs, either meta morphosed or in the form of perfect dykes, have been distinguished under this group. Granites of a light grey colour and very fine grain are found, forming isolated hills along the boundary of the Foliated Schists on the east and Lower Devonian beds on the west. In part of the south-western extremity of New Zealand, coarsely crystal line granites, of white and flesh colour, appear to break through and overlie the younger members of the crystalline schists. Igneous Rocks. \u2014 The igneous rocks have played an important part in almost every formation in New Zealand, marking great movements of the earth's crust at the different geological periods, while the superficial and later formed volcanic rocks occupy nearly one-third of the area of the North Island. These rocks are found on a line which extends almost continuously through the South Island ; but diorite rocks reappear in the most northern parts of the North Island; they are generally more or less metalliferous, chrome and copper being the ores of most frequent occurrence. Basic Volcanic Rocks belong to three different periods, when there were active eruptions, attended by the forma tion of floes of both compact igneous rocks and tufaceous breccias. The earliest of these occurred during the Triassic period, and consists chiefly of diabase and ser pentinous breccias. The next eruptions took place about the close of the Jurassic period, along the base of the Alpine range in the central part of the South Island, where the rocks occur in dome-shaped mountains as melaphyres associated with felsite (quartz) porphyries. In the Cretaceo-Tertiary period are massive trappean eruptions of trachy-dolerite and dolerite, while in the same period must be placed the propylite group con sisting of greenstone-trachytes and fine and coarse-grained"], [28, "10 GEOLOGY \u2014 MINERALS \u2014 NATURAL HISTORY. breccia rocks, which form the matrix of the auriferous reefs in the existing Thames goldfields. In Eocene times dolerite floes were contemporaneous with the limestones of the period of the Hutchinson's Quarry beds, while lastly in this group have been placed the basaltic lavas of Pliocene age in the northern parts of New Zealand, and also certain dykes of vesicular lava tbat cut through and alter Pliocene gold-drifts in the Maniototo plain in the present provincial district of Otago. The Acidic Volcanic Rocks have a similar distribution in time to the foregoing, the earliest being the felsite (quartz) porphyries, while trachyte porphyries and breccias played an important part during Cretaceo-Ter tiary and older Tertiary periods, scoriaceous lavas and rhyolites being the characteristics of the later outbursts. The geysers and boiling springs in the North Island give rise to the formation of siliceous sinter, which must be included as the most purely acidic product of volcanic action, and as due to the decomposition of the older rocks by the action upon them of fresh water ; but in the case of White Island and other localities, where the decompo sition is brought about by the agency of sea-w-ater, the sinter deposits are formed chiefly of sulphate of lime, and not silica. New Zealand was rich in its deposits of Economic Minerals, namely, Chrome, Coal, Copper, Gold, Granite, Graphite, Iron, Lead, Limestone, Marble, Mercury, Mineral Oils, Silver, Sulphur, Zinc, and others. These elements of national greatness lay, like other great resources of the country, dormant, waiting for the awakening touch of industrial civilisation. The natural history of New Zealand is a most inter esting study. I can only give a short summary of its characteristic features. The land was singularly destitute of indigenous quadrupeds ; the only terrestrial mammalia known were two species of bat, a small rat, and a dog which probably was either introduced since the islands were peopled by the present aboriginal race, or brought with it in its first migration to the country. The rat contributed largely to the food of the natives, but it has long since disappeared, having been exterminated by the introduced Norway rat. Of the two species of bat"], [29, "11 NATURAL HISTORY\u2014 BIRDS. mentioned, one (ScotopMbus tuberculatus) is identical with an Australian form, whilst the other (Myotacina tuber- culata) belongs to a strictly endemic genus. Pigs were the produce of animals left by Captain Cook and subse- quent navigators. The birds of New Zealand amount to one hundred and seventy-six kinds, of which sixty-seven are land birds, twenty-six waders and shore birds, and the rest sea birds. The Apteryx, or Kiwi, a remarkable wingless bird, about the size of a large fowl, is still found in mountain ranges. There are four species of this bird, which is the existing representative of a struthious wing- less bird (the Moa or Dinornis). The Moa in former times inhabited New Zealand, but it has long been extinct, and is only known to us from its fossil bones, of which large numbers have been found in the swamps and tertiary deposits of both islands. There are not less than six species of parrots, two of which keep to cold Alpine solitudes. One of the most remarkable of the New Zealand birds is the Kea Parrot (Nestor notabilis) . It is a mountain species, and was first discovered by Mr. Walter Mantell, in 1848. At that time it was a harmless fruit-eating parrot ; but, with the progress of colonisation and the consequent stocking of the country with sheep, this bird has, strange to relate, developed carnivorous habits \u2014 attacking the living sheep and inflicting a deep wound in the regi-7n of the kidneys for the purpose of extracting the fat. On some of the southern runs, adjacent to the mountains, some thousands of sheep are killed every year by the Keas ; and so severe did the nuisance become that the aid of the Legislature had to be invoked for the purpose of extirpating the bird. There are three birds of passage, two of which are of the cuckoo family, migrating to New Zealand in summer from warmer latitudes ; and the third is the Zosterops lateralis, or \" Blight Bird,\" as it is commonly called in the colony ; this bird is migratory between the North and South Islands. There are three honey-birds : (1) the Tui, or \" Parson Bird,\" as it is popularly called, from its having two tufts of white feathers on the neck, and a shining- jet plumage, like a clergyman's white bands and black gown ; its scientific name is Prosthemadera nov\u0153- Zealandi\u0153. It is a good mocking-bird, and belongs to the family of the Meli phagid\u0153. (2) The Kotihe (Pogonornis cincta),.z, beautiful"], [30, "12 B IRDS \u2014 LIZARDS. bird with velvety black head and wings ; it has a bright yellow circle round the lower part of the neck and wings, and is about the size of a skylark. (3) The Korimako (Anthornis melanura) ; this is the sweetest songster of the country, and is commonly called the \"Bell Bird.\" The smallest bird is a little warbler called Riroriro ; it is of a greyish-yellow colour, and is very tame. The Shining Cuckoo (Pipiivarauroa) lays its eggs in the nest of the Riroriro. The Piopio (Tumaga crassirostris) is a thick billed species of thrush. The Piwakawaka (Rhipidura flabellifera) is a fly-catcher, a pretty, lively bird, with a fan-tail, and is very tame. The Miromiro, a little black and-white bird, flies about graves and solitary bushes. The Kukupa, or Wood-Pigeon (Garpophaga novce-Zea landi\u0153), is a fine, large bird, frequents forests, and, in season, is excellent eating. The Kotuku, or the White Crane (Ardea flavirostris), is an elegant and very rare bird. \" Rare as the Kotuku \" has passed into a native proverb. The Paradise Duck is abundant in the South Island ; it is a fine bird, but is not equal in flavour to the other wild ducks. There are eight kinds of rail, and three of hawks ; the Harrier, the Quail-Hawk, and the Sparrow-Hawk. The Ruru is a small owl. The Huia (Hetaralocha acutirostris) is remarkable for the white tips to its tail-feathers. There is a New Zealand Robin, a sedate and social bird. Coloured illustrations and full descriptive accounts of New Zealand birds, with informa tion of every kind respecting them, will be found in the \" History of the Birds of New Zealand,\" by Sir Walter Buller, K.C.M.G., F.R.S. ; now passing through a second edition. Many forms of lizard are to be met with in New Zealand. Of the remarkable Tuatara lizard there are two well-defined species \u2014 Sphenodon punctatus, which has been known for many years, and another, recently discovered, called Sphenodon gunthero. This singular reptile, which possesses the most bird-like skeleton of all existing lizards, constitutes per se a distinct order of reptiles ; and con siderable scientific interest in eonsequence attaches to it. Of the smaller kinds of lizard there are no less than twelve recognized species, the largest of which is about eight inches in length. According to native accounts there"], [31, "13 FR OGS \u2014 INSECTS \u2014 FISH. were in former times many other species, and some of them of very large size. Frogs have been found, but very rarely. They belong to a species characterized as Liopelma hochstetteri, in compliment to the distinguished Austrian geologist whose scientific services to New Zealand are a matter of history. There are no snakes of any kind ; nor is there any dangerously venomous insect, except the Katipo, a black spider which is only found in sedgy grass on the seaside. There are, however, innumerable hordes of sandflies, which bite by day in sandy spots, and of mosquitoes, which, by day and night, are equally irritating in swamps and in forests. The family of locusts, or grass hoppers, is numerous. There are many sorts of spiders. Grubs are various kinds ; one pierces the Puriri, the hardest timber in New Zealand, and makes a hole equal to the size of a large nail. The Weta is a forest cricket, three inches long. Dragonflies are of four or five varieties; and there are several kinds of ants. Butterflies are few. There is one kind of green-coloured moth (Gharagia hectori) that is nearly six inches across, from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. The vege tating caterpillar, the Hotete, is a singular production ; it is found at the roots of certain trees. The generally accepted theory is that this caterpillar, in its passage underground, for the purpose of its metamorphosis, catches in the folds of its skin the minute seeds of a certain kind of fungus, which, rapidly germinating, kills the grub and occupies its body, and afterwards sends up a shoot and fructifies above the surface. Leeches exist on land and in lakes and ponds ; some attain a large size. The scarcity or almost total absence of mammals in New Zealand is the distinguishing feature of its fauna ; and this fact, coujjled with the former existence in its islands of a race of giant wingless birds (Moas) of several genera and many species, invests the natural history of New Zealand with special interest from a zoo-geographical point of view. The rivers in New Zealand only produced the eel and a few small fishes of little value, but the variety and abundance of fish on the coast are very great. The New Zealand fishes resemble those found on the coast between Madeira and the Bay of Biscay more than they do those"], [32, "14 B 0 TANY \u2014 FL 0 WERS. which are caught about the north of Scotland. New Zealand in its variety and quantity of edible fish compares favourably with the British Islands. In addition to the varieties of edible fish which remain on the New Zealand coast throughout the year, a large number of the edible class are pelagic in their habits, and roam over a wide range of ocean, visiting the New Zealand shores irregularly in pursuit of food. New Zealand is the chief centre of southern whale fisheries ; and the sea-bear or fur-seal (Arctocephalus cinereus) is found in remote parts of the coast. Out of one hundred and fifty species of fish enumerated as found in New Zealand, sixty-seven species are, so far as is yet known, peculiar to New Zealand ; seventy-five are common off the coasts of Australia, or Tasmania, while ten species are found in New Zealand and other places, but not in the Australian seas. New Zealand Ichthyology presents a very distinct character, and affords a wide field for further observation and scientific investigation. The botany of New Zealand has a character distinctively its own. The number of known flowering plants is 935 as against 1500 in the British Islands. But a large pro portion of this New Zealand Flora is peculiar to the country, there being no less than 677 endemic species and 32 endemic genera. Of the 258 species not peculiar to New Zealand, no less than 222 are Australian, but of the latter many forms are also common to South America and to the continent of Europe. Out of a total of 303 New Zealand genera, no less than 251 are also found in Australia ; but of this number only 32 are absolutely confined to these countries. It will be seen, therefore, that there is a decided affinity of the New Zealand Flora to that of Australia ; but this is almost entirely confined to the least predominant species, all the commoner forms being entirely unrepresented. Owing to this cause, the ordinary observer fails to detect any resemblance between the vegetation of the two countries. The general aspect, in New Zealand, of the open land, uniformly sombre in large extents of fern, flax, and tussac-grass, strongly contrasts with the flowery fields of England. Few flowering plants can be seen ; but in the forests there are six or seven kinds of scarlet flowers belonging to shrubs or timber"], [33, "15 FLAX \u2014 FERNS \u2014 TREES. trees, where also are seen the graceful palm and fern-tree. Among the plants the New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax) is most remarkable. It is a handsome liliaceous plant, with abundant upright leaves of a glossy dark-green colour, and often from six to eight feet long ; each leaf has a double facies with a distinct midrib, and on scraping off the seventh epidermis the fibrous tissue is at once dis closed. For many years it was sought to discover some simple mechanical process for separating the underlying gummy substance from the fibre (as effected by the manual scraping resorted to by the natives), so as to render this product available for commerce. I may observe, by the way, that this difficulty has at length been to a great extent solved. This flax was to the aboriginal inhabitants of New Zealand what the cocoa-nut tree is to the Hindoos ; it was used for building and thatching huts, for sails, nets, fishing-tackle, plates, ropes, baskets, medicine, and for tying up anything required to be kept together. From the flax flowers a honey drink was ex tracted, and from the roots of the leaves an edible gum ; sandals were made out of flax by the natives living in the South Island ; and flax variously prepared, chiefly in the North Island, furnished many kinds of mats and articles of clothing, some as coarse as straw mats, and others as soft as the shawls of Cashmere. The valuable qualities of the fibre of this plant are also well known, since New Zealand has been colonised, throughout Europe and America. New Zealand is also very rich in ferns. No country in the world possesses so great a number of genera and species. They vary in character and appearance from the sombre Pteris aquilina, or edible fern, which covers the hills, resembling the common English bracken, to the beautiful Todea superba, with its lovely fronds of velvet green, which display themselves in the form of \" the Prince of Wales's feathers.\" There are also many fami lies of grasses, sedges, lichens, mosses, fungi, and sea- weeds. The most tropical of all New Zealand trees is the Nikau (Areca sapida) ; it is the only representative of the Palm\u00e6. This is a graceful and beautiful tree ; it attains the height of forty feet, and is a foot in diameter ; the flower forms a large droop of flesh colour, and is succeeded by a bunch"], [34, "16 TIMBER \u2014 KAURI \u2014 TOTARA, ETC. of berries. It is found only in the thick forest. The Tree-ferns, some of which grow to the height of forty feet, are also remarkable for their extreme grace and beauty. Unfortunately, they shun observation, and flourish best in the solitudes of the forest. These lovely speci mens of New Zealand vegetation are the characteristic features of the forest. There are six well-defined species, each with a special beauty of its own, but all having in common a crown of drooping fronds on a firm central stem. The commonest species are the Silver-leaf Tree fern (Cyathea dealbata), and the Black-stemmed Tree-fern (Gyathea meclullaris), from the latter of which the natives extracted a valuable farinaceous food called \"mamaku.\" The general character of the New Zealand timber resembles the growths of Tasmania and Australia, most of it being harder, heavier, and more difficult to work than the majority of European and North American woods. Many varieties of New Zealand woods are very durable; and Manuka, Totara, Kauri, Black-birch, Kowhai, and Matai appear on the whole to be the most highly esteemed. A number of native forest trees and plants furnish good dyes from their bark. The natives were acquainted with most of these, and dyed their flax mats and baskets with them. The Kauri (Dammara australis) is a noble tree ; it rises sometimes to two hundred feet high, with a girth of forty feet, and a clear stem, without a branch, nearly a hundred feet high ; its timber and the resin that exudes from the tree are valuable. It grows to the north of the Manukau in the North Island ; and large forests of it had long disappeared when New Zealand was first colonised. The former existence of these forests is proved by the quantity of Kauri gum which lies hidden underground in their sites ; and it is difficult to explain why new generations of trees did not succeed to those that died. The Totara (Podocarpus totara) is also a magnificent tree, and has excellent timber. Out of the large trunks of the Totara and Kauri canoes were scooped ; and the tough Manuka tree furnished paddles and spears. The Toatoa (Podocarpus asplenifolius) grows in large clumps, and the bark makes a brown dye. The Tanekaha (Phyllocladus trichomoides) is a beautiful tree which flourishes on the sides of hills. The wood is close-"], [35, "17 TREES. grained, durable, and fragrant ; the bark makes a strong dye. The fruit of the Miro (Podocarpus ferruginea'j is of a bright-red colour, and is aromatic in its flavour. Wood pigeons fatten on it. The timber is valuable, but does not attain a large size. The Kahikatea (Podocarpus dacry dioides) is called the White Pine ; it thrives best in swampy ground, and grows to a large size, but the timber is not durable. The Matai (Dacrydium mai) is very like the yew ; it becomes a large tree, and the wood makes good furniture. The Kawaka (Dacrydium plumosum) has a remarkable leaf, and furnishes a durable wood. Rimu (Dacrydium cupressimum) , commonly called the Red Pine, is one of the most ornamental trees in New Zealand ; its green foliage hangs down in graceful festoons ; and its wood, when burnt as fuel, has a pleasant fragrance. The timber is valuable for furniture and house-building. The Pohutukawa (Metrosideros tomentosa) has numerous mas sive arms, and is an ornamental tree ; it attains a height of from thirty to sixty feet, and has a diameter of from two to four feet. The timber is of a dark red colour, and is specially adapted for ship-building. The tree grows among rocky cliffs, and bears rich scarlet blossoms. The Rata (Metrosideros robust a\") is a tall, erect tree, fifty to sixty feet ; diameter of trunk, four feet. The descending roots often form a hollow stem twelve feet in diameter. The timber is dense and durable, and is used for ship building. The tree grows in the North Island. Another Rata (Metrosideros lucid a) is a very ornamental tree ; it attains a height of thirty to sixty feet ; the diameter is two to ten feet. The timber is of a dark-red colour, and is a valuable cabinet wood ; it is much used for knees and timber in ship- building. The tree is rare in the North Island, but abounds in the South Island, especially on the west coast. The Karaka (Gorynocarpus l\u0153vigata) re sembles the English laurel, but grows to the size of a timber tree ; the leaf is large, glossy, and dark-green ; the fruit is in appearance like a date, but is not agreeable to the taste. The Kohekohe (Dysoxylum spectabile) makes a large tree ; its leaves are bitter and have a tonic property, and its wood resembles mahogany. The Titoki (Alectryon excelsum) is valuable in ship-building ; it is a beautiful tree, and bears large panicles of reddish c"], [36, "18 TREES, TIMBER. flowers. The Ake (Dodon\u0153a spitulata) is the toughest of all woods. The Wau produces wood light as cork ; and the Hohere a fine net-like fibre under the outer bark. The Hinau (El\u00e6ocarpus hinau) bears bunches of fragrant bell-flowers. The Kaikomako (Pennantia corymbosa) is a small and very graceful tree, with white sweet-smelling flowers ; its height is twenty to thirty feet. The natives used the wood for kindling fire by friction. The Tupa kihi, or Tutu-tree (Coriaria sarmentosa), is abundant throughout the islands. The so-called berries (fleshy petals) are not poisonous ; the juice is purple, and is drunk by the natives ; and a wine like elderberry wine is made from them. The seeds and leaves contain a poisonous alkaloid, and produce convulsions, delirium, and death ; and are sometimes fatal to cattle and sheep. There is a dwarf species (Coriaria ruscifolia), the properties of which are the same. The Kowai (Edwardsia microphylla) and the Kowai ngutu-kaka (Glianthus puniscens) are hand some shrubs, the former bearing pendent yellow blossoms, and the latter, rich scarlet flowers in the shape of a parrot's beak. The Kareao (Bhipogonum scaiidens) is the \" supple-jack,\" a very tough cane, which climbs to the tops of the highest trees, and, intertwined with the under growth at their base, makes the forest impassable until a pathway is cut. There are also other climbing plants, such as the Aka (Metrosideros buxifolia) ; the Rata, with bright red flowers; and the Tataramoa (Rubus australis)., the native bramble. The careful observer of New Zealand forestry in general will probably be struck with one remarkable feature, namely, the great proportion and variety of trees which supply woods specially adapted for building and fitting ships, boats, and for erecting permanent wharves and jetties. As I have already pointed out, the external con figuration of both islands, and the internal system of navi gable waters in the North Island, are conducive to the growth and spread of commerce. With that great end in view, Nature has been also specially bountiful in providing various and good kinds of timber for maritime purposes. It will also be found that in the North Island, where over land communication was most difficult, those particular kinds of trees most abound ; and, further, that the multi-"], [37, "19 TIMBER. tudinous streams and tidal creeks therein permeate far inland the intricate recesses of large forests, and thus furnish available means of transporting the timber to places where it can be most conveniently manufactured and used for the purposes required. In connection with this subject, it is also worthy of note that the abundant New Zealand flax is excellently adapted for the manu facture of cordage and canvas. In these respects, as in others, New Zealand presents a wonderful combination of natural appliances available for the intelligent industry of civilisation towards the accomplishment of great ends."], [38, "20 MA ORIS\u2014 ORIGINAL MIGRA TION. CHAPTER II. Maoris \u2014 Original migration \u2014 Physical description \u2014 Mental faculties \u2014 Mythology \u2014 Tribal division \u2014 Land tenure \u2014 Social condition \u2014 Ceremonies \u2014 Occupations \u2014 Native 'villages \u2014 Cl jthes \u2014 Orna- ments \u2014 Amusements \u2014 Wars \u2014 Language \u2014 Poetry \u2014 Arithmetic \u2014 Diseases \u2014 Aptitude for civilisation. This interesting land, the natural features of which I have cursorily sketched, was not uninhabited by man when it first became known to Europeans. The Maoris, as they name themselves-*--a term which corresponds with what we call Aborigines \u2014 probably never numbered more than 150,000 souls, and were tribally scattered here and there, almost wholly within the North Island. They were cannibals, almost altogether ignorant of mechanical arts, practising a rude kind of agriculture, devoid of religious belief except in some confused notions of good and evil demons, and addicted to savage intertribal warfare. Their origin is open to question ; and their own tradition, which I give on the authority of the late Sir Donald McLean, for many years Native Minister in New Zealand, and one of the best authorities on the subject, is that their arrival in New Zealand, at that time, almost certainly, uninhabited by man, was due to an event which, from its physical possibility and from the concurrent testimony of the various tribes, is probably true in its main facts. The tradition runs that, generations ago, a large migration took place from an island in the Pacific Ocean, to which the Maoris gave the name of Hawaiki. Quarrels among the natives, so the story goes, had driven from it a chief whose canoe arrived on the shores of New Zealand. Re turning to his home with a flattering description of the country, this chief, it is said, induced a number of his"], [39, "21 PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION. fellow-countrymen to emigrate to this new land, to which accordingly a fleet of large double canoes started. The names of the canoes are still remembered ; and it is related that the immigrants brought with them the Taro, seeds of the Karaka tree, dogs, parrots, the Pukeko, or red- billed swamp hen, etc. Strong evidence that there is truth in this reported exodus is furnished by the fact that each tribe agrees in its account of the journey of the chief canoes, and of the families who came in them ; and there is, moreover, an agreement in tracing from the families in each canoe the descent of the numerous tribes which have occupied different parts of both islands. Calculations based on the genealogical sticks kept by the tohungas, cr priests, have been made that about twenty generations had, in 1875, passed since that migration. Giving to each generation an average duration of twenty-five years, the date of the migration would be about five hundred years ago. The exact position of Hawaiki is not known. There is, however, Savaii in the Samoa group, and Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands. Judging from the language and the legends of the Maoris themselves, there can be no doubt that they are a branch of the great Polynesian family. I proceed to give a short descriptive summary of the chief characteristics of this remarkable race, which, while barbarous, has shown considerable intellectual power, great mental receptivity and capacity of expansion. In the compilation of this summary, I have largely availed myself of the statements, founded on careful inquiry and personal observation, made by Dr. Thomson in his \" Story of New Zealand,\" published in 1859, and by the Rev. James Buller in his \" Forty Tears in New Zealand,\" pub lished in 1878. Physically, the Maoris, by which name, as their own, it will be convenient to distinguish the aborigines of New Zealand, are in stature almost equal to Englishmen, the average height of the Maori male being 5 feet 6^ inches. In bodily frame the Maoris . \" muscular and well-formed, and in weight and girth of >. test they are about equal to Englishmen ; their bodily shape differs from that of Englishmen of similar stature, in having longer bodies and longer arms, but shorter legs. The colour of the skin is light brown, but it has many shades; the eyes"], [40, "22 PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION. are large and dark ; the teeth are good ; the hair of the head is abundant and generally black ; and the forehead is high, narrow, retreating, and pyramidal. The face of the Maori is quiet and composed when in a state of rest, but in moods of excitement it is expressive and emotional. As a rule, the Maori has the faculty of facial command, and the art of disguising his thoughts and feelings. The chiefs generally are fine men, and have specially a grave and dignified bearing. Maori women are less handsome than the men, but have, while young, a pleasing appear- ance, gentle manners, and soft voices. Tattooing was practised by both sexes ; the operation was undergone at the age of puberty, and the process was very painful. It was probably adopted as a personal ornament, and also to hide the visible effect of advancing age. The men had their faces, hips, and thighs tattooed ; and the women, their lips, chins, and eyelids. The mode of operating was first to draw the lines with charcoal ; to puncture the skin along those lines with a sharp instrument of bone, or steel, driven in by a small mallet ; and afterwards to drop in a pigment prepared from a vegetable substance. The consequent inflammation was so acute that the operation was suspended at frequent intervals and occupied a long time. The habit has lately gone much out of fashion. Natural deformity among the Maoris is rare ; but scrofula is common. Albinos are sometimes seen. There is in some of the Maori race a Papuan element, which shows itself in an inferior grade of men, with a worse-formed cranium, large features, prominent cheek- bones, full lips, with hair curly and coarse, though not woolly, a darker complexion, and a shorter figure. Half castes and quadroons are generally handsome in both sexes. The mental faculties of the Maoris are better than the barbarous condition of the race would lead many to anticipate. Their memories in many respects are excellent ; their imaginative power is good, though naturally apt to run to seed in absurd superstitions. Their perceptive powers are quick, and their reflective powers are not inconsiderable. Their sense of humour is strong ; they are eloquent in speech, fond of deliberative meetings, and many are skilful in metaphorical illustration and"], [41, "23 MENTAL FACULTIES \u2014 MYTHOLOGY. persuasive in debate. They are apt in learning, clever in imitation, and fond of novelty. Theft is rare among themselves, and they are naturally truthful. They are hospitable to strangers, and generally cheerful and self confident in demeanour and conversation. Of course, many of their higher mental qualities were undeveloped from want of proper cultivation ; but the good seed was there, ready for growth under more favourable conditions. Their great want is steadiness and continuity of mental attention. They are naturally indolent, and they have no idea of the value of time. They are suspicious and quick to resent wrong; retaliation is the law of their nature; and their love of fighting is passionate. In warfare they show courage, endurance, and great skill in offensive and defensive operations ; their excitement at such times is intense, and leads to terrible cruelty and bloodshed. They have not what is generally understood as love of country, but they have strong affection for their tribal associations and possessions. They are not a mere nomadic race of barbarous hunters, but they cultivate land, and thev recognise among themselves tribal tenure of land ; and each tribe holds communally, among its various sections, lands, forests, cultivations, and fisheries, the respective boundaries of all which are well known among the tribes generally. Probably, the two most remarkable charac teristics of their minds is their keen appreciation of gain, and their astonishing aptitude for learning from a superior race. To their possession of these two faculties, the suc cess, as a whole, of our colonisation of their country may chiefly be attributed. The mythology of the Maoris was only a series of small superstitions. They had no conception of a Supreme Being, and no idea of future rewards and punishments. They had a countless list of minor deities, who were not held in much practical account. It was to the spirits of departed chiefs, who were regarded as still taking an active part in worldly affairs, that earnest invocation was addressed, and it was their invisible action that was dreaded. There was a recognised order of priests and of wise men, who were credited with communion and inter course with gods and .spirits, and the members of this order were cunning in all arts which served to maintain"], [42, "24 M F THOL 0 G Y\u2014 TRIBAL DI VISION. and increase their influence over the superstitious multi tude. The belief in witchcraft, sorcery, and the evil eye was strong. The law of tapu, which was held sacred by Maoris in common with all Polynesians, was powerful as a substitute for religion in regulating the conduct of their social and domestic life. The word \" tapu \" is derived from ta, to mai'k or touch, and pu, real. It signified the process of setting apart, or of making sacred. The ground work of this singular institution was that something of divine essence passed into the thing made sacred. Chiefs and priests had the power of this consecration. The transgression of the tapu was death, or, at least, some terrible calamity. Abused as this prerogative of a few may have been, it served on the whole as an effective means of securing a rude sort of organisation and govern ment. The civil division of the Maoris among themselves was tribal. Writers have grouped tribes into nations, but the latter term is misleading. It is more intelligible to say that groups of families composed a tribe, and that groups of tribes composed a clan. The clans were eighteen in number, and they were independent of each other. Each tribe, as a rule, managed its own affairs under the general direction of its chiefs, but, ou critical occasions involving public safety, each clan combined for attack or defence. Many tribes constituted a clan, and there were several subdivisions in a tribe. The prefix ngati means offspring, and served as the generic term for a tribe, as Ngatiwhatua, Ngatiporo, Ngatiawa, etc. ; analogously to the use of the Irish prefix 0', or the Scotch Me, in their family nomen clature. The generic direction of affairs was vested heredi tarily in chiefs ; and the highest rank united the twofold authority of one who was not only a chief, but also a priest. Chieftainship descended to eldest sons in a direct line, and, in failure of male issue, passed into the female branch. The authority of a chief, however high his rank was, had its limits. He could not declare peace or war, or alienate territory, or do anything affecting the whole community, without tribal authority; and, in case of resistance to his commands in any case, he had no power of enforcing his will upon any but his slaves. Rights in landed property were nominally vested in the chiefs, but"], [43, "LAND-OWNERSHIP \u2014 SOCIAL CONDITION. 25 also really in the whole tribe. Maori titles to land were of the most complicated character ; but, at the same time, they were far from being mere trifling technicalities ; on the contrary, they were things of material substance, for which the claimants were ready to fight and to die. Con quest, occupation, inheritance, and various other circum stances were title-deeds to large territories ; and there was not a foot of land in New Zealand without a claimant. The consequence was that perpetual disputes concerning boundaries and debatable territory caused frequent blood shed and often chronic intertribal war. The Maori pro verb is that land and women are the roots of war. Every individual of a tribe had a right to cultivate some soil for himself, subject to the public opinion of his tribe and to the law of tapu. Public assemblies of the tribe were the exponents of public opinion ; and the priests regulated the tapu. In this rude administration of justice, every one had a right in the open assembly to express his opinion. Retaliation, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, was the principle of penal justice. The primary object of punishment was not the prevention of crime, but the avengement of injury. A wrong done to any one by a member of another tribe was treated as if inflicted on the whole tribe ; and any member of the tribe to which the offender belonged might be selected as utu, or payment, for the offence. Within the tribe itself, the actual aggressor was held accountable. On the whole, the civil relations of the Maori tribes, both within themselves and in regard to each other, were based on the principle of democracy tempered by the aristocracy of birth. The two great motive forces of executive administration were the tapu, the force spiritual, and the utu, or satisfaction, the force terrestrial. The application of each force was in many cases almost ludicrous, but, no doubt, the general effect was to secure roughly organisation and government in a barbarous state of society. The social condition of the Maoris was to a great extent communistic. They had among themselves no idea of trade, and their wants were supplied from a common store. They gave gifts to each other, and looked for gifts in return ; but that reciprocity was in general between tribes separated from each other, and not between individuals"], [44, "26 SOCIAL CONDITION. belonging to the same tribe and living together. There were three grades in the Maori social scale : first, the Rangatira, or chief ; secondly, the Ware, or commoner ; and thirdly, the Pononga, or slave, who or whose parent or parents had belonged to a different clan, and had been captured in battle and had been enslaved. A commoner could rise to the dignity of a chief, if he were brave, eloquent, or wise. In social intercourse there was little distinction between these grades, even between chiefs and slaves, but this arose more from the condescension of the chief than from presumption on the part of the slave. Slaves, as I have said, were those who were captured in battle, and their descendants for ever. They w-ere the absolute property of their owner, and their lives were at his disposal. Generally, they were not ill treated as long as they did what was required of them. Their employment was cooking food, hewing wood, drawing water, and general attendance on their master. Slavery was a taint never wiped out ; the influence and status of the greatest chief were for ever destroyed by his slavery, and he could never regain his former position even by restoration to freedom. Ceremonial visits among the Maoris were frequent, and feasts were often given to visitors from distant places on an abundant and even wasteful scale. There was much of Eastern politeness in the intercourse between hosts and guests, and hospitality, in its broadest sense, was scrupulously observed. The guests would arrive, clad in their best garments, their heads adorned with feathers, their faces painted with red ochre, and their bodies besmeared with the fat of birds and the oil of fish. The young men of the village would rush forth, and greet their guests with shouts of welcome. There is much natural courtesy in the primitive code of Maori manners, which is often wanting in the artificial code of civilised society. Strangers were hospitably treated, and no word was said on either side as to the purport of their visit, till they had had their food. I was myself much struck, when travelling many years ago in a New Zealand forest far from any civilised habitation, by a mark of scrupulous politeness on the part of a Maori who had seen next to nothing of civilised life. We bought from him a pig, and when we had cooked part of"], [45, "27 POLITENESS \u2014 BIRTHS, MARRIAGES, DEATHS. it, we offered him some of it, naturally supposing that he would share our meal. However, he politely declined, and, on being pressed for the reason, explained that he had sold the pig to us, and that he did not think it right both to sell the pig and also to eat part of it. This un- expected trait of character made me feel that occasionally principles of true politeness were found outside the pale of education and refinement. The Maoris have among themselves two curious modes of salutation, namely, the hongi, or rubbing of noses ; and the tangi, or weeping. The common salutation between mere acquaintances is simply the side-pressure of nose to nose, and nothing else ; but between relatives and near friends, especially if they have not met each other for a long time, the pressure of noses is attended by a low lachrymose whine and by showers of tears for nearly half an hour continuously. Their general bearing towards each other and towards visitors is dignified and courteous. Polygamy, chiefly in the higher ranks, was common. Chastity in single women was held in little account ; but infidelity of wives sub- jected the offenders to death. Births, marriages, and deaths were interesting events in the Maori calendar. At the birth of a child, if of high rank in the tribe, there was great rejoicing. Some of the ceremonies observed sug- gest the Levitical ritual. The place of birth and every person and thing connected with it were sacred, and, for the time, separate from all things common ; and, when the child was eight days old, the parents and friends gathered together by some running stream for the cere- mony of purification. A person sprinkled water over the child, with a branch of a tree, and gave the child its name, using at the same time some invocations. Children were subject to little restraint as they grew up ; they were looked on as the property of the tribe ; and, if any mis- fortune befell them, the father was held accountable, and mulcted accordingly. In marriage there was no ceremony. Betrothals often took place in infancy or childhood, and were made from tribal considerations. Deaths were occasions of much observance, especially when a chief died. Friends from a distance would come to the place to bewail the deceased, and the corpse was laid out in state. Women would vehemently gesticulate and sing a dismal"], [46, "28 B URIALS \u2014 0 COUP A TIONS. dirge, cutting their faces and their breasts with sharp shells, till they were covered with blood. The mourners cut their hair close on one side of the head, and wore garlands of green boughs. Occasionally, some of a great chief's wives strangled themselves at his death, in order that, as they thought, they may be able to wait on him in the next world. All that had anything to do with, or was in con tact with, the corpse was tapu. Various modes of burial were used. Sometimes a grave would be dug in a house, or mausoleum ; at other times a frame would be made for the body by joining two pieces of a canoe ; and often the body would be carried into the recesses of the forest, and left between the forked branches of a tree. When de composition was complete, exhumation, or recovery of the remains, would be made ; and there would be a great feast, and another wailing for the dead. The bones would be carefully scraped and painted red, and then wrapped in a mat, and, with strict observances, be either placed in a small house resting on a pole, or taken to the top of some sacred tree, or more often carried into some secluded cave. Great reverence was paid to the place of sepulture, and violation of its sanctity was only to be expiated by death. Monuments, painted red, were elaborately carved, and the whole was surrounded by a fence, but to those who knew the spot superstitious awe was the best protection against trespass. The Maoris were not without occupation. The men built huts, cultivated the soil, fished, hunted, cleared patches of forest for cultivation, manufactured tools, moulded and carved canoes, fortified their pahs, or villages, and were often engaged in hostile expeditions. The women cooked, wove mats, weeded cultivated plots of ground, and were otherwise engaged in much menial labour. The Maoris were good judges of the qualities of soil. The Kumara (the sweet potato) and the potato were grown by them to a large extent, and they kept their plantations neat and clear from weeds. They made canoes ; the largest would carry one hundred persons ; some canoes were beautifully carved, their prows and taff rails adorned with feathers, and painted red. They used their war canoes, those of the largest size, in their war incursions, in their fishing expeditions, and"], [47, "29 COOKING \u2014 FO OD \u2014FISHING. on great occasions. The imperfect character of their instruments, which were of wood, or of bone, or of stone, made their manual work tedious and difficult. Their cooking was simple and good. A hole, eight inches deep and three feet in diameter, was made in the earth ; stones were made red hot ; layers of flax and fern were put on the heated stones; the food, washed very clean, was laid upon these layers, and was covered over with mats ; water was then poured on it, and the steam arose ; earth, or ashes, then was heaped up, and shut in the steam. Women prepared for each meal special dishes made from the flax leaf ; and, at the right moment, the oven was uncovered, and the food, excellently cooked, was served up in fresh dishes on each occasion. However neglectful of cleanliness in their own persons, the Maoris were remarkably clean in the cooking of their food. The diet of the Maoris was chiefly fish and vegetables. In times of scarcity it consisted largely of fern root and other roots, and of the pith of the Korau (fern-tree) and the stems of the Nikau (palm). There were also some poor edible fruits, such as the Karaka, the Taua, the Hinau, and others. Birds were also caught in snares ; and a small rat, which disappeared soon after the intro duction of the European rat, was considered a great delicacy. The Maoris ate also the vegetable products of their cultivations ; and the importation by Captain Cook in the years 1769-77, of the pig and potato, and their astonishing spread afterwards, did the Maoris a sub stantial service in the way of food. Pork was, however, only kept for special occasions ; pigs which had run wild were caught and devoured at any time. Cannibalism was only a practice in time of war ; it was not apparently due to the scarcity of food, or to a taste for human flesh ; but, presumably, it arose from the passions of hatred and revenge inflamed by the terrible excitement of war. Can nibalism inflicted on the victim the greatest degradation to which he possibly could be subjected. In fishing, they not only used hooks made of bone, but also nets and seines made of the fibres of the flax leaf. They would go to sea for ten or more miles from the shore, for the pui-pose of catching deep-sea flsh. Some of their nets were a thousand yards in length. The"], [48, "30 VILLA GES\u2014HO USES. Maoris had no good projectiles, and they caught birds with snares, nets, and dogs. Native villages, or pahs, as they were called, were often fortified, and were usually built on commanding sites, with an open prospect around them, and with sup plies of wood and water close at hand. War pahs are good illustrations of the Maori genius for defensive war fare. These pahs had double rows of fences on all otherwise unprotected sides. The inner fence, twenty to thirty feet high, consisted of poles stuck in the ground, and lightly bound together with supple-jack and other creepers. The outer fence, from six to eight feet .high, was built of lighter materials. Between the two there was a deep, dry ditch. The only openings in the outer fence were small holes ; and in the inner one, sliding bars. Upon the palisades were placed exaggerated wooden figures of men with open mouths and out-hanging tongues. Stages for sentinels were at every corner, and in the centre scaffolds, twenty feet high, forty feet long and six feet broad, whence darts were hurled at the enemy. The introduction of firearms changed the construction of these fortifications, and the change showed the engineer ing capacity of the Maoris. The deep ditch was replaced by a series of rifle-pits connected with, each other under ground. Loopholes and flanking angles have been intro duced. Native houses were often well built, but they were low. Their shape was oblong ; the walls inclined inwardly ; one sliding door and a window were the only apertures to let in light and to let out smoke. A large porch, or verandah, was at the sunny end. The houses were cool in summer and warm in winter. The frame work was of hard wood, neatly adzed ; the planks were from one to two feet wide. The ridge-pole was supported by strong posts sunk into the ground. To the posts, which were of Totara timber, w-ere fastened long poles, and between the pilasters coats of bulrushes were securely tied. The inner side was ornamented with reeds to the roof ; the outside was protected by bark. The posts, the uprights, and the ridge-pole, as well as the end of the verandah, were carved in grotesque figures, and all the woodwork was painted white, red, or blue. Stores for food were placed on high poles for protection from"], [49, "31 DRESS \u2014 ORNAMENTS. the ravages of rats. Some of the best-built houses were Kumara stores. The human habitations were of all sizes ; some would only hold five persons, and others, of a more public character, would accommodate five hundred persons. The ivhare-puni (hot-house) was designed for warmth in cold weather. The house was very low ; the outside air was excluded ; wood burnt to charcoal made a clear fire, and around it from thirty to forty persons would huddle together, in a temperature of more than ninety degrees. Maori men and women wore simple apparel. A skirt petticoat, not unlike a kilt, covered the loins. A mat was worn by males, fastened on the right shoulder, and by females, on the left. There was no covering for the head and feet, except in some parts of the South Island, where flax sandals were used. Flax belts were worn round the waists of men. Children were naked until about ten years of age. Chiefs wore more valuable mats than persons of lower rank. Flax, dog-skins, and the feathers of sea and land birds were the materials of Maori dresses. Twelve different mats were made out of flax. The Kaitaka mat is the softest, and most esteemed ; it varies in size ; the largest is twelve feet long and seven broad. It was made of close parallel lines of flax, having transverse cords at the distance of an inch, with black and white borders nearly a foot broad. It occupied one person eight months to weave a Kaitaka mat, and Maoris living at the East Cape of the North Island were the most skilful manufacturers of this mat. The most valued of their ornaments was the heitiki, a curious image made of greenstone, from the size of a shilling to that of a plate, representing a human body not unlike a Hindoo idol. This ornament was suspended from the neck, and was handed down from father to son. From the perforated ears of both sexes there hung either ornaments of greenstone, jade, and serpentine, tiger sharks' teeth, flowers, white down from the breasts of the albatross and gannet, wings of dead birds, or teeth of near relatives and dear friends. As an ornament, women allowed their beautiful and profuse hair to grow long ; but girls cut it on a level with their eyebrows. Men tied their hair in a knot on the crown of their heads, and retained it in that position with carved wooden combs."], [50, "32 A MUSEMENTS \u2014WARS. The amusements of the young were various. Among them I may mention games, such as kite-flying, spear throwing, walking on stilts, riddles, singing, dancing, wrestling, foot-racing, leaping into water, and swimming. Their musical instruments were very few and simple ; one was a flute, from three inches to two feet in length, open at both ends, and with two or three holes ; it is played by blowing into one of the holes, or into one of the ends. The best kind can only produce three or four simple notes. The other musical instrument was a trumpet made of wood ; it was seven feet long, and one or two notes were only obtainable fi-om it. It was generally used for rousing men to action in time of war. The Maori in the quiet routine of social life was very different from the Maori in the excitement of war. And war was such a passion with the race, and was of so frequent occurrence, that it is literally correct to say that quiet life was the exception, and fighting the rule. Every man was trained to war from childhood, and even the women were active assistants in warfare. Maori nature was inflammable and vindictive. Resentment of injury never subsided until satisfaction had been obtained ; like the Corsican vendetta, it was handed down from one generation to another. Accordingly feuds, old and new, were always at hand, and pretexts for fighting were never wanting. The most fertile cause of war was, as the Maoris themselves say, owing to some dispute about woman or land. War on a large scale was decided on at great meetings, and was preceded by religious rites. Recourse, also, was had to auguries and omens. Little wars required less ceremony and preparation. Fighting consisted gene rally in guerilla warfare, in the siege of villages, in marauding expeditions, and in indiscriminate slaughter, whenever an opportunity occurred, of men, women, or children belonging to the opposing tribes. If the scene of war was distant and accessible by water, a fleet of large war-canoes would convey to it the fighting men. Before actual engagement, warriors would work them selves into frenzy by a war-dance. Those who have seen the war-dance in its original reality find it difficult to describe in adequate terms its revolting character. The Rev. James Buller, in his \" Forty Tears in New Zealand,\""], [51, "33 WAR-DANCE \u2014 WEAPONS. p. 246, gives the following graphic sketch of those who took part in this dance of death : \u2014 \" They looked more like demons than men. All in a state of nudity, the face and body blackened with charcoal, the whole army, running some distance, arranged itself in lines, and assumed a squatting posture. At a given signal they suddenly sprang to their feet, holding the weapon in the right hand. With a simultaneous movement each leg was alternately elevated ; and then, with a sudden spring! they jumped into the air, and made the ground shake as they came down again. AU the while, they uttered savage yells, ending with a long, deep sough ; their mouths gaping, their tongues pro truding, their eyes goggling, and all the muscles of their bodies quivering. They slapped their naked thighs with the palm of their left hand with a defiant sound. This would be repeated again and again ; old women, disfigured with red ochre, acting as fuglemen in front of them, and all keeping time with the chorus of the war-song. In: calm weather the sound of the war-dance could be heard for miles. Maddened with rage, the combatants hurled their spears, and with fierce screams rushed on to mutual conflict. To have the honour of slaying the first man was an object of ambition.\" Before the introduction of firearms, the conflicts,, as in Homeric times, were hand-to-hand. The combatants used various weapons. I may mention spears, made of white pine hardened by fire, from four to fourteen feet long, and sharp at both ends ; the greenstone mere, which weighed about six pounds, was thirteen inches long, and in shape resembled a flattened soda-water bottle. The greenstone, or jade, of which these weapons are made is called nephrite by mineralogists, and is found in the South Island of New Zealand ; the most valuable kind is clear as glass, with a slight green tinge. Meres are also made of serpentine, jasper, dark grey stone, whalebone, and wood. The patu was a wooden weapon, in shape not unlike a violin, and a little longer than the mere. The tohi, or adze, was a favourite weapon ; its handle, made of wood, was two feet long, and the adze was made of greenstone, or of dark basalt. Wooden clubs of many kinds, occa sionally carved, and adorned with feathers and dyed flax, were used in fighting. Slings for throwing spears n"], [52, "34 MODE OF FIGHTING \u2014 LANGUAGE. and stones were also Maori weapons. The usual time for attacking a village was in the grey dawn, when, as a rule, the inhabitants were in soundest sleep. Cruelty and outrage of every kind were inflicted on the vanquished. All were mercilessly put to death, except those kept as slaves. The warm blood of those killed was drank; their bodies were cooked and eaten ; the heads of chiefs were^preserved, and fixed on poles as ghastly trophies at the feasts of the conquerors. The return home of the victorious army was greeted by the women with hideous noises, grimaces, and contortions ; and those who had lost near relations wreaked their vengeance on the captives. After feasting, the best orator was selected to recite the achievements of each conquering hero ; and there is no doubt that those achievements gained much in the recita tion. Sometimes, during warfare, peace was honourably made. A herald, the Nestor of the tribe, was sent with a flag of truce, which was the green bough of a tree ; and, if terms were mutually agreed upon, the peace would be ratified by a friendly feast. The only approach to written language among the Maoris, until it was taught to them by the missionaries, was a sort of genealogical record, kept on notched sticks by priests as the means of transmitting the names of successive chiefs for the last five hundred years. It was the custom of the priests of several tribes to keep nominal lists of their great ancestral chiefs, and for this purpose sticks, upon which a notch was made as each chief died, were carefully preserved by the priests. The name repre sented by each notch was implanted in the memory of the priests ; and it was their duty to keep the recollection of this genealogy alive in the mind of the people bv occasional repetition of the names at public assemblies. The oral language of the Maoris is a dialect of the Polynesian language, which in its turn is believed to be of Malay origin. Throughout New Zealand the language was for all practical purposes identical, although, in different parts of the country, there was an inconsiderable variation of dialect. Nasal, dental, and guttural sounds prevail in pronunciation. The language, when represented by the English alphabet, is composed of fourteen letters \u2014 a, e, i, o, u, h, h, m, n, p, r, t, u, ng ; no two consonants,"], [53, "LANGUAGE \u2014 LEGENDS\u2014 SONGS. 35 except the nasal ng and the diphthong wk, come together ; and every syllable in each word ends with a vowel. The inflection of nouns and the conjugation of verbs are all done by simple particles, prefixed or suffixed. The singular is changed into the plural by the prefix of a syllable. A particle supplies the place of the verb \"to be.\" Every verb has not only active and passive meanings, but alsoa causa- tive meaning. The declensions of nouns, the distinctions of pronouns, and the conjugations of verbs are all simple and precise. The pronouns have three numbers, singular, dual, and plural ; these again may be called inclusive and exclusive. The language has several articles, singular and plural ; and abounds in prepositions, adverbs, and conjunctions, each having its own delicate shade of mean- ing. The same word or root stands for noun, verbal noun, adjective, or verb. For simplicity, terseness, and euphony., the language is remarkable, while it also has beauty and power of expression. A competent Maori linguist has said of the language that it enables the Maoris \" to give proper names to every natural object, however small ; different names, not only for a tree and its fruit, but for every part of a vegetable, whether above or below ground, for the young and adult fish of the same species, for every- thing made by themselves, and for each of its various parts, for every kind of tattooing, and each line and marking of the same ; and upwards of fifty names for a sweet potato, and forty for a common one.\" The Maori language abounds in legends, songs, and proverbs. The ballads of a people best interpret its character, its customs, and its history. Sir George Grey, during his first adminis- tration as Governor of New Zealand, did excellent work by collecting and publishing much of this traditionary lore. The legends are various. Some relate to the fabled origin of creation ; others, also apocryphal, relate to the lives and achievements of their heroes and demigods who are supposed to have lived in remote antiquity ; while a few, on which reliance can more safely be placed, recount the migration of their forefathers from Hawaiki, and the history of the tribes after their arrival in New Zealand. Songs were of different kinds. There were chaunts, used whenever men worked together, the object of which was to ensure \"a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all"], [54, "36 PRO VERBS\u2014 ARITHMETIC \u2014DISEASES. together.\" There were also songs respectively appropriate to subjects of love, of war, and of death. Much of the poetry is lyrical, and consists of metaphor and allusion to striking objects. Singing is generally accompanied with pantomimic action suited to the words. The death-songs or funeral laments may be said to contain the highest order of native poetry ; they often express and excite in the hearers feelings of real emotion. Proverbs are not as numerous as legends and songs, but some, like the follow ing, are good specimens of proverbial wisdom: \u2014 \"Food given tickles the throat, but food gained by one's labour is the food which satisfies ; \" \"A mussel at home, and a parrot abroad ; \" and, \" He who goes before gathers treasures, but he who follows looks for them in vain.\" The Maoris could not compute past time ; they could not recollect, or convey any idea how long ago any former event had happened. Their only knowledge of time was day and night, and the change of seasons shown by the position of stars and the flowering of plants. Their arith metic consisted in the use of the Malay numerals up to ten, and of terms for hundreds and thousands. Twelve was \" ten and two ; \" twenty was \" two tens ; \" twenty-two was \" two tens and two ; \" and so on between each ten up to one hundred, and analogously afterwards up to a thousand. In reckoning, they also used the binary scale, as one pair, two pair. Sixteen baskets of potatoes would, in their language, be \"eight baskets twice told.\" Measure ment was expressed only by cubits and fathoms. The cubit was the length from the bend of the arm. to the tip of the middle finger ; the fathom was the length repre sented by both arms stretched out horizontally. The kinds of diseases which originally prevailed among the Maoris form an interesting subject of investigation. Dr. Thomson, whom I have already referred to, devoted special attention to this subject during his residence in New Zealand for eleven years, while surgeon of H.M.'s 58th Regiment. I extract from chapter xi. of Part I. of his book, \" Story of New Zealand,\" the following passages, showing some general results of his personal observation : \u2014 \" Diseases of the lungs are more frequent than among the English. Consumption is the most prevalent form of this class of diseases ; and spitting of blood, one of its"], [55, "37 DISEASES. earliest symptoms, is looked on as a harbinger of death. Asthma occasionally occurs. Consumption is produced by the poor diet, ill-ventilated huts, and insufficient clothing of the natives, causes of consumption which act with much virulence on the constitutions of men originally formed to live within the tropics.\" \"Diseases of the stomach and bowels are more frequent than among the English. Most of the attacks are of diarrh\u0153a and indigestion, and rarely produce death ; although both assist .in the development of scrofula and consumption, and are caused by the use of bad food. Diseases of the brain are much less frequent than among the English, and the headaches of civilised men are unknown.\" \"Temporary fits of insanity, the result of acute and chronic disease of the brain, and melancholy, leading to suicide, and produced by superstition, are not unfrequent. True insanity is rare. . . . Epilepsy is unknown.\" \" Dropsies are rarely seen. . . . Rheumatic affections are more frequent than among the English, a result attributable, among other causes, to careless exposure to the weather without suitable clothing ; few of the attacks produce disease of the heart, but sometimes local palsy.\" \" Diseases of the eyes of a scrofulous character frequently occur, and sometimes terminate in partial, or complete, blindness. Cataract occurs in the aged, and several cases of amanrosis have been seen. Diseases of the skin are frequent, and, from want of personal cleanliness, the maladies are often inveterate. Scaldhead and ringworm occur; herpes zoster, or the shingles, is unknown. Dirty mats convey skin-diseases to the healthy. Scrofula is the curse of the New Zealand race. In some districts twenty per cent., and in others ten per cent., of the population bear on their bodies the mark of the king's evil, although all scrofulous persons have not this outward sign of scrofula. Scrofula is the predisposing and remote cause of much of the sickness among the New Zealanders ; in childhood, it causes marasmus, fevers, and bowel complaints ; in manhood, consumption, spinal disease, ulcers, and various other maladies. The remote cause of scrofula is the constitutional tendency which the people inherit from having originally migrated from the tropics; the imme-"], [56, "38 DISEASES. diate cause is using potato diet for three hundred days in every year, intermarrying with scrofulous persons, and living in huts worse than dog kennels.\" \" Diseases of the heart are not frequent. Erysipelas is rare. Scurvy is almost unknown. Elephantiasis has not been seen at any hospital, but I have met with two men afflicted with the disease in the interior of the country. Hernia is common, and occasionally fatal. Cancer of the female breast is unknown, a circumstance which supports the opinion that this dreadful malady results from a high state of civilization. Goitre, night-blindness, cretinism, and hydrophobia are unknown. No case of stone in the bladder has been seen. Infants die from neglected colds and bowel complaints, and the seeds of many diseases are sown in infancy. Dentition is rarely accompanied by convulsions. Intestinal worms are frequent. Croup occurs. Hysteria and chlorosis are uncommon, and, like cancer, these maladies may result from civilisation. Lepra gangrenosa, a strange species of leprosy, occasionally occurs among the New Zealanders.\" After describing in some detail this horrible malady, Dr. Thomson states his belief that it was \"caused by a deficiency of proper nutriment, by filth, and a low social state,\" and that civilisation will probably in the course of twenty years more cause its extinction. New Zealand women suffer little during child-birth, and \" they enter upon their usual occupations twenty-four hours after delivery, often immediately after the child is born. Puerperal convulsions rarely occur, and death seldom overtakes parturient women, although infants often perish.\" \" The native mode of healing diseases was peculiar. According to the New Zealand school of medicine the remote causes of all diseases were violation of the tapu, and witchcraft ; and the immediate cause, residence in the body of spirits g-nawing- at the vitals. Prayers and physic were the antidotes for the diseases the gods inflicted, and incantations destroyed the maladies inflicted by witchcraft.\" \" For the cure of external and surgical diseases, the people had no confidence in prayers and incantations. Splints made from the bark of trees, and flax bandages, were applied to broken bones ; hot poultices of leaves and"], [57, "DISEASES\u2014 GENERAL CAPACITIES. 39 roots were applied to boils, and their cure was hastened by opening them with a thorn, or a shell, long before the formation of pus ; clay plasters were applied and retained on fresh wounds until they healed. Punctured wounds were violently squeezed to excite bleeding, and then held over smoke. Cobwebs were used to check h\u00e6morrhage. Bathing in the hot sulphur and siliceous baths of Rotorna, Taupo, and elsewhere, was reckoned useful in cutaneous diseases. Rheumatism was treated by scarification, pigeon's-oil frictions, and blisters ; the latter were pro duced by the application of irritating leaves. Lumbago was treated by rolling heated stones over the loins ; bleeding from a vein was never resorted to. Vapour and warm baths were used. The former was made after the manner of a cooking oven ; the latter by throwing red-hot stones into water. Persons suffering from suspended animation were hung heels upwards over a wood fire, in order that the smoke might enter the lungs and produce irritation ; should the person sneeze or show signs of life, he was laid before a fire and hot water poured down his throat. Vomiting, in cases of poisoning, was produced by mechanical distension of the stomach, and this was effected by keeping the patient under water until his body was filled with it. The sufferer was afterwards rolled about on the ground, pressure being at the same time made over the stomach.\" The foregoing outline sketch of the Maori race, as it was before the colonisation of New Zealand, is necessarily brief, owing to the more general scope of this book and to considerations of space, and may be taken as more suggestive than descriptive. A careful study of the mental and physical characteristics of that race will show that, while living in a low state of barbarism and of benighted superstition, and while habituated to cruel and savage practices, the race had implanted in it germs of high qualities and of great capacities \u2014 germs which would, under favourable conditions, grow into active life, and in due time bear good fruit. As the land inhabited was specially fitted for material development, so the aboriginal race inhabiting the land was itself also eminently fitted for elevation in the scale of humanity. The English nation, which undertook, from honourable motives and by"], [58, "40 COLONISING OF COUNTRY. fair means, to occupy and colonise New Zealand, under took a noble work and assumed a great responsibility.

Otherwise, Tasman, the Dutch navigator, has a fair claim to that distinction in 1642, for he anchored, though he did not land, in a northern bay of the South Island, where also some of his crew, while in a boat, were killed by natives. He named that bay Massacre Bay. Sailing thence along the west coast of the North Island, he rounded its northernmost cape, and named it Maria Van Diemen. He also named the whole land Staten, after the Dutch States-general, believing it to be connected with the then supposed large southern continents. As that idea was dispelled, the Dutch Govern- ment named it New Zealand. In 1769, upwards of a century afterwards, Captain Cook, the great English navigator, supplemented that discovery by more sub- stantial action. He visited the country five times within seven years ; he surveyed a great part of its coasts ; he landed often, and had parties of his men on shore at some spots for considerable spaces of time. He had much inter course with the native race,, and he obtained more or less knowledge of the people, of the land, and of its resources. He was the first to teach the Maori the practice of trading. He took formal possession of the country in the name"], [60, "42 CAPTAIN COOK \u2014 MASSACRES. of George the Third, then King of England. He was the father of New Zealand colonisation, for he successfully introduced into the land pigs, fowls, and potatoes. At the same time, he achieved important scientific results in connection with New Zealand. His surveys were, so far as they went, astonishingly accurate and of great and permanent practical use. He discovered the navigable passage between the North and South Islands. He proved the geographical fallacy, then regarded as an indubitable fact, that New Zealand was- part of a southern continent. He observed the transit of the planet Mercury over the sun, in a bay, which he named Mercury Bay, in the North Island. Misunderstandings, with serious results, occasionally arose between Captain Cook's crew and the natives ; but, on the whole, the relations between both were amicable and satisfactory. Succeeding navigators, who visited New Zealand from time to time for many years afterwards, were not always so fortunate. Among other instances, two are prominent. In 1772, Marion du Fresne, a French commander, and some of his crew were treacherously massacred in retaliation for misdeeds of Captain de Surville and his crew in 1769; and in 1809, the massacre of the crew and passengers of the English ship Boyd took place, with almost worse treachery. Cannibalism added horror to the scene in each case. There can be little doubt, in these two instances, of the treacherous and savage character of the crime committed ; but often it is difficult to ascertain and adjust criminality when no authentic account of all the circumstances can possibly be obtained. It must also be borne in mind that among the Maoris, as well as among many Polynesian islanders, the law of indiscriminate retaliation prevails ; and that its enforce ment is regardless of the lapse of time, and of the question whether the actual person or persons on whom vengeance is taken committed the original offence. It is enough that a wrong remains unavenged, and that the wrong-doer and those made responsible belong to the same race. Neither should it be forgotten that fatal misconception is apt to arise between two races ignorant alike of each other's language, customs, and feelings ; and this is more espe cially the case when one of the two races is barbarous, and"], [61, "TERROR TO MARINERS \u2014 FIRST MISSION. 43 the other is civilised. Outrages in matters of the most superstitious reverence in the mind of the inferior race are unintentionally, or perhaps sometimes wantonly com mitted ; and often innocent action of individuals of that race is misconstrued and summarily punished. When we reflect how frequently trifling causes of misunderstanding have led civilised and Christian nations, who can easily communicate with each other, into mutual prolonged and bloody wars, we cannot reasonably wonder that, in circum stances which I have mentioned, fatal collision should often take place. Treachery also is not regarded as dis honourable in the native mind when satisfaction for wrong is sought ; and, moreover, I regret to say that gross fraud has occasionally been practised, by men belonging to civilised nations in which it is regarded as criminal, in the commercial and social relations of those men with Maoris and many Polynesian natives. For thirty-seven years after the last departure, in 1777, of Captain Cook from New Zealand, that country was generally regarded with terror by mariners, on account of the cannibalism and ferocity of its aborigines. Neither the prospect of shelter, nor that of fresh provisions, could tempt many a storm tossed and starving crew to its shores. The tempestuous aud inhospitable ocean was preferable to the land of savage cannibals. The first European residents in New Zealand came in 1814 to the Bay of Islands, close to the northern extremity of the North Island, as representatives of the English Church Missionary Society. The pioneer of the missionary movement in New Zealand was the Rev. Samuel Marsden, a clergyman of the Church of England and Senior Chaplain at the time in the colony of New South Wales. In November, 1814, Mr. Marsden, accompanied by three other missionaries, Messrs. Kendall, Hall, and King, established the first mission station in New Zealand at the Bay of Islands. When the news of that good work reached England, others co-operated, and new mission stations were gradually established. In 1822, the Rev. Samuel Leigh, on behalf of the Wesleyan Mission Society, took up his residence in New Zealand, and was followed by several colleagues. In 1838, the Roman Catholic Bishop Pompallier arrived in New Zealand, with several priests, and established the Roman Catholic"], [62, "44 MISSION WORK ESSENTIAL TO COLONISATION. Mission. A German Protestant Mission was established in 1846, and its first station was at the Chatham Islands. These islands consist of one main and two much smaller islands, and are about 365 miles eastward of Cook's Strait in New Zealand. The main island extends west-south west and east-north-east about thirty-eight miles, and from north to south twenty-five miles, and has a coast deeply indented by large bays. These islands are now included within the colony of New Zealand. The aborigines on them were called Moriori, and their language was similar to that of the Maoris, of which race they formed a part. Each mission, in its own sphere, gradually grew in strength, and, as opportunity offered itself, extended its operations. Mission work in New Zealand, irrespectively of denomi nation, was essential to the colonisation of .New Zealand, inasmuch as it prepared the way for the peaceful occupation of the country by England, and, moreover, did much, in the early years of the colony, in the interests of peace, order, and good government. Had it not been for the pre liminary work of the missionaries, I feel sure that the British colonisation of New Zealand, and more especially its colonization by any other nation, would have been retarded for at least another generation. And I am in clined to think that prolonged scenes of bloodshed, if not the extermination of the Maoris, would have preceded colonisation, and that the hearthstone of every colonist would have beneath it the skeleton of a Maori. Captain Hobson, the first Governor of New Zealand, stated in 1841, in his address to the Legislative Council, as follows : \" Whatever difference of opinion may be entertained as to the value and extent of the labours of the missionary body, there can be no doubt that they have rendered important service to the country ; so that, but for them, a British colony would not at this moment be established in New Zealand.\" Again, many years afterwards, Mr. F. D. Fenton, Chief Judge of the Native Land Court, in one of his written judgments, characterised the missionaries as the only efficient State police then existing in the country, and referred to the frequent reliance of the Government on their labours in the time of trouble; and added the following words : \u2014 \" When we see the great things these"], [63, "45 MISSIONARY CHARACTER. men achieved, and the influence they have gained, with out gifts of money to covetousness, or offering of power to ambition, we must admit that some secret existed in their system, which would be a valuable knowledge for the Government when they are no more.\" It has been the fashion in some quarters to decry the missionaries as a body, because some four or five indi viduals belonging to the Church of England Mission bought from natives, in the early days, long before New Zealand became an English colony, considerable quantities of land for small sums. As against the missionaries generally, the charge is absurd, because, with that insig nificant exception, missionaries did not buy or accept for themselves personally native land. And as against the individuals in question the charge is not one of serious import. Admitting that in the few instances referred to an error of judgment had been committed, that error is pardonable, when it is considered that the price paid for the land was at the time a fair and satisfactory price ; that the validity of the purchases was never questioned by the natives concerned ; and that those who bought the land were anxious to provide for their numerous children. The character of Archdeacon Henry Williams, who was at one time held out to public reprobation as the head and front of this offending, has since been fully vindicated. Almost contemporaneously with the first signs of life in the missionary movement in New Zealand, a sad hindrance to its growth was caused by the introd uction of guns and gunpowder into the country. The possession of these destructive arms- by the natives who obtained them added a sudden and powerful stimulus to their lust of conquest and of vengeance in their intertribal relations, and im mensely increased their means of slaughtering their foes. Two great native chiefs, Hongi and Waikato, visited England in 1*820, and learned how to use firearms. At Sydney, on his return homewards, Hongi sold all the valuable presents he had received in England, except a suit of armour which had been given to him by George the- Fourth, and applied the proceeds to the purchase of three hundred muskets and ammunition. Upon his arri val at the Bay of Islands, he foi-thwith headed a hostile expedition into the central portion of the North Island,"], [64, "46 ANXIETY FOR FIREARMS and in this expedition his firearms caused at least two thousand to be slain. The natives throughout New Zealand soon learned that the possession of guns and gun powder was indispensable to self-preservation, and every thing was subordinated to their acquisition. In those years of unrestricted trade the general demand was sooa followed by the general supply. The Maoris sold land, flax, pigs, and potatoes, and, in return, almost solely re ceived munitions of war, between the years 1824 and 1840. A few muskets purchased a small ship-load of native flax or a territory of ten thousand acres. For the eighteen years next preceding the establishment of the colony in 1840, this fatal possession led to exceptional frequency of conflicts among the Maoris ; and it has been estimated that twenty thousand lives were, during that time, directly and indirectly sacrificed by this cause. At the same time, it may be admitted that the possession, when it became general and well established, gradually led to diminishing frequency of conflict and to less amount of slaughter. Be that as it may, there is no doubt that the sudden and partial introduction of firearms into New Zealand during the early years of missionary labours greatly added to the difficulties, already numerous and grave enough, which the missionaries encountered. Missionary work may be divided into two great classes : one, the spiritual work of conversion ; and the other, the material work of civilisation. It is a mistake to think that the spiritual conversion of the Maoris was sudden and sensational. Ten years passed after the establishment of the first mission station before the first baptism of a Maori ; and during the whole of that time all the missionaries worked zealously, and patiently awaited the result. By slow degrees progress was made. The translation of the Bible into the Maori language was a work towards the accomplishment of which unceasing effort was made. In 1837, the translation of the New Testament was completed, and soon afterwards other por tions of the Bible were translated. The British and Foreign Bible Society printed, as translations, 60,000 copies of the New Testament, 2000 copies inclusive of the Psalms, and 10,000 books consisting of selections from the Old Testa ment, and gave them to the Church of England and"], [65, "47 SPIRITUAL WORK. Wesley an missionaries for distribution. In 1838, two years before New Zealand became a British colony, the Church of England Missionary Society supported in that country five ordained clergymen, twenty catechists, one farmer, one surgeon, one superintendent, one printer, one wheelwright, one stonemason, aud two assistant-teachers. The Wesleyan Mission had, in the same year, five ordained clergymen, and several on their voyage out. The Roman Catholic Mission had one bishop and twenty priests. The converts were then estimated at 4,*000 souls. Shortly afterwards, conversion had a rapid growth, and began to overspread the land. Native churches and schools were filled ; children and adults learned, and taught others, to read and to write in their own language ; and in schools many children learned the English language. Converted natives helped to propagate Christianity in parts where the majority of their countrymen had never seen a European missionary. It has been said that the extent to which the conversion spread was exaggerated, and that the conver sion itself was mostly, if not altogether, nominal. In some measure, that may be so ; but it is impossible to deny with truth that the actual extent was comparatively great, and that, in many cases, the conversion was real. The testimony to these facts by missionaries, and laymen of the highest character, and enjoying the best opportunities of iudging, is conclusive. It is, no doubt, true in the case of all religion, even in civilised countries, that many persons are only nominal professors of it ; and it is also true that, in the case of the Maoris, an extensive apostasy from their profession of Christianity took place in 1864, and for some years afterwards ; but, as I propose hereafter to show, that apostasy was actuated more by political than by religious motives, and is not likely to be permanent. It may there fore, I think, be safely asserted that the substantial result of missionary labours in New Zealand has been, under Divine Providence, the conversion of the great majority of the Maori race to the Christian religion. I now come to the second class of missionary work, namely, the material work of civilisation ; and, fortu nately, it is easier to form a correct judgment about material than about spiritual work. Sir William Fox, who has been about forty-five years"], [66, "48 MATERIAL WORK. in New Zealand, and who has had excellent opportunities of judging, bears witness to the efficacy of missionary work in the material improvement of the Maoris ; and his testimony in that respect is the more valuable inasmuch as, politically, he was in general an opponent of mis- sionary secular views in native affairs. In a short account of the natives in connection with the colonisation of New- Zealand he wrote as follows : \u2014 \" Having described the character of the native race as it was at the period of Cook's arrival, and painted it in the dark colours which truth demanded, it is only fair to say that before syste- matic colonisation commenced it had undergone a great change. The teachings of the missionaries, if the results were somewhat superficial, had penetrated to almost every part of the country. This, and the example of civilised life in the mission homes, scattered over a large area, had done much to qualify the worst features of savage life, and to soften the ferocity of the Maori character. Wars were less frequent, cannibalism nearly extinct. Inter- course with the European trader and whaler, if less ele- vating, had yet broken down the prejudice against the pakeha, and given the Maori a taste for European con- veniences and desires, which could be best gratified bv the permanent residence among them of large numbers of foreigners.\" In 1867, the Rev. James Buller visited at the Bay of Islands the native Hemi Tautara, and wrote about him as follows : \u2014 \" He was a superior native, a store-keeper ; and his wife, a lady-like half-caste, played the piano. Hemi used to run a schooner between the Bay of Islands and Auckland, and was very popular with all classes of passengers ; he had been brought up by the late Arch deacon Henry Williams. Would that such pleasing instances of Maori civilisation were more common ! \" I do not, of course, quote this instance as an average one, but it shows \u2014 and it would be easy to multiply instances, of high though inferior merit, of what has been done at a mission school. In striving to Christianise a nation the missionaries necessarily did ranch towards civilising it. They taught reading, writing, and the English language. Many indus trial arts were also taught; and the habits of cleanliness,"], [67, "49 MLSSION LIFE \u2014 MISSIONARIES. order, and application were inculcated. Missionary influ ence, moreover, practically put an end to cannibalism, polygamy, infanticide, slavery, much superstition, and many evil customs. Intertribal warfare became less fre quent and less vindictive. Christianity led the way to progressive civilisation. Mission life was in early years a time of great trial. Isolated from all civilised intercourse, surrounded by savage tribes, it was continuously subjected to great pri vations, to serious dangers, and, especially in the case of families, to terrible anxieties. The Wesleyan Mission at Wangaroa in 1827' lost all but their lives at the hands of the natives ; and, in 1836, the Church of England Mission suffered similar treatment at Tauranga and at Rotorua. Those who live at home at ease can little imagine what mental suffering, the worst of all suffering, those have to bear who, from day to day and from night to night, live in lonely wilds, cut off from human aid, and exposed at any moment to attack from savages, and who, it may be said, ever carry their lives and the lives of their families in their hands. Let those who lightly talk of what missionaries have borne picture to themselves, if they can, the scene when a helpless family is awakened in the dead of night by barbarous yells, and, robbed of everything even if life be spared, is driven away from home, without shelter and without food. But the duties of missionaries often took them long distances from their homes, and travelling then in New Zealand was difficult and dangerous. Missionaries suffered much \"in journey ing often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers,\" \" in perils by the heathen,\" \" in perils in the wilderness,\" \"in weariness and painiulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness,\" and \" the care of all the Churches.\" The old missionaries of New Zealand have passed away, but they have left behind them an imperishable heritage of good. As colonisation came and made progress, the specialty of their work lessened and ceased. They were a heroic band, and their lives illustrate difficult and important duties well and faithfully done. Their path of life was arduous and comparatively obscure ; but they trod it with unfaltering steps, and followed it up to its E"], [68, "50 MISSIONARIES \u2014 OUR COLONISING AGENCIES. great end. They lived and died men of lowly estate, and their names cannot be found in gazettes and in lists of titular distinctions. They had no trumpets sounded before them, and they did not stand in synagogues and at corners of streets to be seen of men. The history of New Zealand during and for many years after its first colonisation records in this world their appropriate reward. The missionaries did much to facilitate the colonisation of New Zealand. By then- action, in a great measure, the occupation of the country on equitable terms became prac ticable. Moreover, they made known the capacity of the Maoris for Christian civilisation, and the resources of New Zealand for industrial objects. It must not, how ever, be understood that the missionaries, as a body, desired, and premeditatedly worked for, that end. Some of them, as individuals, deprecated it, and looked forward to its advent with dread as the probable reversal of their spiritual success, and as the ultimate destruction of the Maori race. Even in England, the Committee of the Church Missionary Society opposed the project first put forward by the New Zealand Company for planting settle ments in New Zealand. At the same time, I think the great majority of the missionaries foresaw the inevitable approach of colonisation in some shape or other, and were sincerely anxious that it should be undertaken and directed by the British Government under the sovereignty of the Crown. At all events, their work had indirectly a tendency towards that result. But there were other agencies at work in the same direction, though they dif fered much in kind, were impelled by different motives, and used different means. Men, mostly from the lower classes of Europeans, were scattered here and there in remote parts of New Zealand, who acted, unintentionally and perhaps unknowingly, in the van and in the cause of civilization. Sealers, whalers, speculators, adventurers, outcasts, and others landed and resided in the country. They were few and scattered, but their very dispersion extended their influence over a larger space. Many of them led loose and irregular lives, and some were of the criminal class ; but the evil of their presence, except pos sibly that of the worst, was not unmixed with some good."], [69, "PAKEHA MAORIS\u2014 IRREGULAR IMMIGRATION. 51 The conditions of their former lives were altogether changed, and they had neither similar temptations nor similar opportunities. Their isolation among barbarous men, who would at once resent and summarily avenge insult and injury, bound them to good behaviour. They married, according to native custom, Maori wives ; they taught those among whom they resided trading and some industrial arts, and they showed them, in a rough kind of way, larger prospects and greater capabilities in life. Trading was probably the strongest and the most active force in breaking down the barrier which surrounded the Maoris, and in bringing them into touch with the outer civilised world. They sold flax, pigs, potatoes, and even land ; and bought blankets and other manufactures for common domestic use, and also, with especial eagerness, firearms, bullets and gunpowder, and tobacco. Simul taneously with the springing up of trade, a small but important class of Europeans came into being, known as Pakeha Maoris, a term which signifies, if I may use the expression, foreigners Maorified. Their origin is uncer tain ; they were probably waifs and strays of civilisation, living among native tribes, half as shows and half as slaves. As soon, however, as the trading spirit began to be felt in the country, they were treated with great respect and consideration. They became resident agents, interpreting and negotiating in trading business between natives and Europeans, and they were looked upon as perennial fountains of wealth. Every inducement to settle in various parts of the country was offered to them by competing tribes ; they were treated as great chiefs -, they had the choice of high-born women as wives, and of the best spots of land as homes. Each tribe was proud of its possession of a white man. Some men of this class were successful in bringing from the coast into the interior large quantities of trade. And what brought the country into closer and more immediate contact with Great Britain was the fact that the British colony of New South Wales was the near neighbour of New Zealand, and that almost the whole trade was with that colony. Another class of facts forced itself slowly but strongly, in behalf of undertaking this new colonisation, on the reluc tant mind of the British Government. An irregular"], [70, "52 TRAFFIC IN ARMS \u2014 LAND PURCHASES. influx into New Zealand of persons almost wholly British subjects was taking place and was increasing. I call the influx irregular, because the inflowing population was subject to no proper legal control. The Maoris had no recognized judicature, and the British Government were practically powerless. Trade added seriously to the complication. The purchase of arms and ammunition by the natives was carried on to an alarming extent \u2014 alarming, both in its immediate effect of increasing inter necine war, and also in the very probable contingency that, sooner or later, British subjects would become the victims. >So reckless of human life was the Maori mind, and so strongly was it inflamed with the passion for guns, that, because preserved native heads were for a time in high estimation in European museums, the heads of chiefs were kept for sale ; and slaves were even killed for the sake of their heads, when it was found that a head could purchase a gun. Again, land purchases from natives were rapidly taking place, in some cases mere colourable pretences, and were assuming formidable dimensions. Speculators, subjects of the British Crown, foreseeing colonisation and snuffing from afar enormous profits, were buying up at nominal prices, chiefly with a few muskets and kegs of gunpowder, territories as large as English counties, or even, in some instances, larger than the principality of Wales. The Maoris knew at the time little or nothing about the sale of land ; and, while they were very accurate as to the boundaries of their lands, and most tenacious of their territorial rights, the adjust ment of their various tribal interests in every piece of land was most intricate, and required patience and time. Still a number of speculators flocked to New Zealand from New South Wales, with ready-made deeds in English legal form, in the hope that they wrould make purchases for little consideration. And in these pretended purchases they were not disappointed, for the offer of guns and gunpowder overpowered all native scruples as to real ownership, or reluctance to part with their most cherished possessions. At the same time, there was a rumour in the air, the practical fulfilment of which would have been extremely unpopular throughout the United Kingdom, and antagonistic to British interests in the Pacific, that"], [71, "COLONIAL OFFICE \u2014 MR. MOTHER COUNTRY. 53 France was contemplating the occupation of New Zealand and its conversion into a convict station. All these agencies, widely as they differed from missionary work and from each other in kind, combined towards one end ; and that end was the British colonisation of New Zealand. The dilemma in which England was placed with refer ence to New Zealand was indeed embarrassing ; but that embarrassment was unnecessarily aggravated by the vacil lating and inconsistent policy of the Colonial Office, which then represented, or rather I should say originated, the various moods of the Imperial Government on the subject of colonial affairs. Colonial administration at that time was peculiar. Home and foreign affairs fully occupied the attention of Ministers and of the House of Commons. There was no public opinion in relation to colonies. Secretaries of State, allotted from time to time as heads of the Colonial Department, knew little or nothing of colonies, and had no time to learn their duties. In those years, there was no self-government in any colony ; and all the varied business of each, differing as it did in situation, in climate, in population, in products, in inter ests, and in other essential circumstances, was transacted by a governor, himself comparatively a stranger, appointed to the place for a few years by the Secretary of State, and acting under his instructions. The natural consequence was, that the Secretary of State became in fact a mask for a few chief permanent officials, who respectively had charge of the correspondence of groups of colonies. The Colonial Office was a small bureaucracy moved by under secretaries who were neither known nor responsible to the public. Hence originated the nickname of Mr. Mother Country. The Secretary of State remained content, so long as no colonial trouble arose in the House of Commons. The policy, therefore, of the Colonial Office was to do nothing which might excite Parliamentary criticism. Activity was its aversion ; innovation, its horror ; and its general disposition was to sit upon, as the saying goes, anything out of the way of ordinary departmental routine. It delighted in writing didactic despatches which led to nothing ; in snubbing independent governors ; in evading awkward decisions ; and in putting off everything at all troublesome to a more convenient season. This state of"], [72, "54 INDECISION OF IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT. masterly inaction had its defects. It could not long withstand the opposing force of public opinion which the progress of commercial enterprise, and the growth of colonies, gradually created at home and abroad. It was, moreover, found that to leave things as they are was not always safe, and that it sometimes gave rise to grave difficulties which embarrassed the Cabinet in the House of Commons. In New Zealand, perhaps more than in any other colony, this political anarchy has been the parent of innumerable woes. It is not, therefore, surprising that the course adopted by the Imperial Government in reference to New Zealand was inconsistent and indecisive. Captain Cook had taken possession of the islands in the name of King George the Third in 1769. His action was confirmed by the Crown, not only by tacit consent, but also by the fact that when New South Wales was declared in 1787, by proclamation, a portion of the British Dominions, New Zealand, although not named, was, as much as Norfolk Island, included within the proclaimed boundaries. In 1825, Mr.Huskisson, the President of the Board of Trade, approved of the project of an English Company to send out colonists to New Zealand. Settlers accordingly were sent out, and arrived at Hokianga on the west coast, opposite the Bay of Islands, in 1826 ; but they were so terrified by native disturbances between two tribes, that they hurriedly left the country. Next came the phase of inconsistency. King William the Fourth, in 1833, addressed the New Zealanders as an independent people ; and, in 1834, recognised their national flag. This flag, I should say, was presented by the British Government to certain chiefs at the Bay of Islands, at the suggestion of Mr James Busby, who had been officially sent from New South Wales as British- Resident in New Zealand. His office resembled a didactic despatch ; it sounded well, and it did nothing else. His duties were vague, and he had no power. He was aptly described at the time as a ship of war without guns. His idiosyncrasies made things worse. He was well-meaning, but narrow-minded, obstinate, and ambitious of self -aggrandisement. It was at his suggestion that a few native chiefs at the Bay of Islands were allowed to select a national flag. And when Baron de Thierry"], [73, "MR. JAMES BUSBY \u2014 NATIONAL FLAG. 55 the son of a French emigrant resident in England, proclaimed himself, on the strength of some purchase of native land, King of New Zealand, Mr. Busby drew up a paper constitution for those whom he designated as the United Tribes of New Zealand. Under this designation, thirty-five chiefs resident in the northernmost part of the North Island declared, at his instigation, their indepen dence, and adopted his constitution, the clauses of which, except perhaps the one appointing the British Resident to preside over a provisional government, must have been utterly unintelligible to the native mind. Moreover, these thirty-five chiefs had no more right to speak in the name of the united tribes of New Zealand, than the three tailors of Tooley Street had to style themselves the people of England. Sir George Gipps, then Governor of New South Wales, properly characterized the whole affair \" as a silly and unauthorised act, a paper pellet fired off at Baron de Thierry.\" Another imperial inconsistency was that, almost simultaneously with the recognition of the independence of New Zealand and of its national flag, a force of soldiers in a man-of-war was ordered to attack natives at Taranaki, on the central west coast of the North Island, in order to rescue certain English prisoners who were retained by the natives out of a shipwrecked crew. The attack was made without proper previous inquiry, and the property and lives of many innocent natives were sacrificed. The expedition was afterwards condemned by a select committee of the House of Commons, who stated that their opinion was founded even on the one-sided evidence of the chief witness interested, an old convict. It is said that the very guns which saluted the New Zealand national flag at the Bay of Islands were thus summarily used against the natives at Taranaki. Coming back to what was taking place at the Bay of Islands, I would mention another social anomaly. The European community, living there on Kororareka beach, consisted of sailors, runaway convicts, traders, sawyers, beach-combers, and adventurers. Life in such an assemblage, and in the absence of all law, was a continuous scene of debauchery and discord. Mr. Busby might probably have done something for the peace, order, and government of that community ; but he was too busy"], [74, "56 NEW ZEALAND COMPANY. in planning the constitution for an aboriginal Utopia, in building his city in the clouds, to attend to such a prosaic subject. The consequence was that the Europeans, left to themselves, sensibly enough, formed themselves into an association for legislative, administrative, and judicial purposes. The association and its acts were, no doubt, illegal, but they were practical and useful, though rough and imperfect, substitutes for anarchy ; and they served to emphasise the call for some decided action on the part of the British Government. Another event at this time took place in England, and brought the question to a definite issue. In May, 1839, the New Zealand Company, formed for the purpose of colonisation in New Zealand, and consisting of influential shareholders, some of whom were members of Parliament, and others leading merchants, sent out the ship Tory to New Zealand, with Colonel William Wakefield, the Company's chief agent, and a staff of officers. Colonel Wakefield was instructed to purchase native land, and to make immediate prepara tion for the reception of settlers. The Company declared its objects to be to purchase land in New Zealand, to promote emigration, to lay out settlements, to i-esell such land at a substantial price which would enable the surplus proceeds to be devoted in due proportions to emigration and to public works ; in short, to carry on systematic colonisation. The Company took this energetic step, the despatch of their ship, in desperation, after having attempted in vain to move the Colonial Office, and to secure its sanction and support. Theoretically, it may be said, the step was illegal, because the formation of a colony by British subjects needs the previous consent of the Crown. Practically, no step was ever taken with more important consequences to New Zealand colonisation. That step was the cause and commencement of that colonisa tion, and its ulterior influence on the character and progress thereof has been permanent and incalculably beneficial. I shall hereafter take occasion to refer more fully to that influence, but at present I only mention the course taken by the New Zealand Company as the last and most effective cause of definite action on the part of the British Government in dealing with the troublesome question of New Zealand."], [75, "CAPTAIN HOBSON, R.N. 57 CHAPTER IV Captain Hobson, E.N. \u2014 Treaty of Waitangi \u2014 Seat of Government at Auckland \u2014 Action of New Zealand Company \u2014 Southern settlements \u2014 Characteristics and special influence of early colonisation \u2014 Progress of colonisation \u2014 Native land purchase. Almost immediately after the sailing of the New Zealand Company's first ship, Captain Hobson, R.N., was sent out to New Zealand as consul, with a dormant commission as Lieutenant-Governor. He was authorised and in structed to enter into a treaty with the natives for the cession of the sovereignty of the islands to the Crown ; and he was directed, as soon as that cession was sub stantially obtained, to proclaim New Zealand as a British colony, and to assume the office of Lieutenant-Governor. The . action of Captain Hobson was prompt and judi cious. He landed at the Bay of Islands on the 29th of January, 1840, and he issued two proclamations : the one, asserting the Queen's authority over British subjects in New Zealand ; and the other, announcing that Her Majesty would acknowledge no titles to land alleged to be bought from the natives, but those derived from Crown grants ; that purchases thenceforth of native lands would be illegal, and that a, commission would inquire into all the land purchases already made. His next task was delicate and difficult, but absolutely essential to his future work. His duty was to try to get the consent of the New Zealand natives to the cession of the sovereignty over the islands to Queen Victoria. He lost no time in the fulfil ment of that duty, and, within a week from the date of his landing, he met an assembly of natives at Waitangi in the Bay of Islands, and laid before them for their con-"], [76, "58 TREATY OF WAITANGI \u2014 NEGOTIATIONS. sideration the treaty, as it is called, of Waitangi, drafted by Mr. Busby, and explained to them by the Rev. Henry Williams. The text of the treaty is as follows : \u2014 \" Article I. \u2014 The chiefs of the confederation of the United Tribes of New Zealand, and the separate and independent chiefs who have not become members of the confederation, cede to her Majesty the Queen of England, absolutely and without reservation, all the rights and powers of sovereignty which the said confederation or individual chiefs respectively exercise or possess over their respective territories as sole sovereigns thereof. \" Article II. \u2014 Her Majesty the Queen of England confirms and guarantees to the chiefs and tribes of New Zealand, and to their respective families, and indi viduals thereof, the full, exclusive, and undisputed pos session of their lands and estates, forests, fisheries, and other properties which they may collectively, or indi vidually possess, as long as it is their wish and desire to retain the same in their possession. But the chiefs of the United Tribes and the individual chiefs yield to her Majesty the exclusive right of pre-emption over such lands as the proprietors thereof may be pleased to alienate, at such prices as may be agreed upon between the re spective proprietors and persons appointed by her Majesty to treat with them on that behalf. \" Article III. \u2014 In consideration thereof, her Majesty the Queen of England extends to the natives of New Zealand her royal protection, and imparts to them all the privileges of British subjects.\" The consideration of this treaty gave rise to much exciting debate. At one time it was thought that the natives would not agree to the treaty from fear that in ceding what was called the sovereignty they would be parting with their lands. The influence of Tamati Waka Nene, well known afterwards as our faithful ally in critical times, determined the wavering balance of opinion in favour of the treaty. He explained that the shadow of the land would go to the Queen, but that the substance would remain, and he appealed to Captain Hobson in touching words. \" Tou must,\" he said, \"be our father. Tou must not allow us to become slaves; you must preserve our customs, and never permit our lands to be"], [77, "TREATY OF WAITANGI MADE \u2014 CRITICISM. 59 wrested from us.\" The treaty was signed by a large number of the most influential chiefs in and about the Bay of Islands, and the adherence of other influential chiefs throughout the North Island, and in parts of the South Island, was shortly afterwards secured. However, before the completion of the acceptance of the treaty in all parts of the country, proclamations of sovereignty over the North Island in virtue of the treaty, and over the South Island and Stewart's Island in virtue of discovery, were issued in May, 1840 ; and, in order to make assurance doubly sure in respect of the South Island, another pro clamation was issued in June, 1840, assuming sovereignty in virtue of the treaty. Accordingly,, the sovereignty over Stewart's Island alone is made to rest wholly on the right of discovery. For a short time, till the 16th of November, 1840, New Zealand was annexed as a depen dency to New South Wales, but on that date the islands of New Zealand were created by charter, under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, a separate and independent colony. The treaty of Waitangi has been, from time to time, the cause of much criticism and controversy in connection with New Zealand. It has been alleged that it was in fact no treaty at all ; that it was made with savages, who had no power, according to the law of nations, to enter into treaties with civilised countries, and who had no right or power of sovereignty to cede ; and that, moreover, the natives who signed the treaty did not understand, and could give no intelligent consent to its provisions. Again, it has been argued that influential chiefs in some por tions of both islands never signed the treaty, and, in many instances, even refused to sign it; and that there fore it could not be binding on them and on their tribes and territories. There is considerable technical force in \"both these classes of argument, and it would serve no useful purpose to discuss the various points on the con troversial ground of international usage. It is enough, for all practical purposes, to say that the treaty is in substance an honourable recognition, on the part of the natives who assented to it, of the sovereignty of the British Crown, and an honourable undertaking, on the part of that Crown, to protect the natives in the possession of their properties,"], [78, "60 CESSION OF SOVEREIGNTY. and to impart to them all the privileges of British sub jects. Looking at the treaty in that light, and taking into consideration all the circumstances, I do not think it is unreasonable to hold that the general, though not universal, native assent given to the treaty i-s substan tially a justification of the British Crown for assuming sovereignty over New Zealand, in accordance with the spirit and with the provisions of the treaty. In that view, the treaty of course lies at the root of our occupa tion and colonisation of New Zealand, and is in fact the Magna Charta of the natives. While, on the one hand, the Crown has a right, in virtue of the treaty, to assert its sovereignty, it is also bound by every principle of good faith to observe scrupulously the provisions of the treaty in its dealing with the natives, and to give as far as possible a generous construction of doubtful points in their favour. This spirit in relation to the treaty has, I am glad to think, always characterised the colonisation of New Zealand. Errors, no doubt, have often taken place, but they have been errors of judgment, and never inten tional injustice. It is needless to say much as to the merits of the treaty itself. It is in effect the native cession of sovereignty in exchange for British naturalisation. The only special provision of an exceptional kind is the one, in the second article, under which the natives \" yield to her Majesty the exclusive right of pre-emption over such lands as the proprietors thereof may be pleased to alienate, at such prices as may be agreed upon between the respective proprietors and persons appointed by her Majesty to treat with them in that behalf.\" It seems to me absurd to argue, as it has been argued, that this provision was essentially unjust to the natives. The practical effect of omitting such a provision would have been to hand over native lands to speculative spoliation. It would indeed have been to keep the word of promise to the ear, and break it to the hope. The cunning arts of land-jobbers and the tempting nature of their gifts would soon have fleeced the natives of their possessions, and plunged the whole country into war. I dismiss the line of reasoning, founded on the principle of treating both races alike, as idle and unworthy of serious consideration. The fallacy"], [79, "SELECTION OF CAPITAL. 61 lies in the assumption that two premisses, essentially unlike each other, can be identically treated with the certainty of the same conclusion. It goes, I should think, without saying, that what is food for one person may be poison to another. It may as well be argued that excep tional laws with, respect to New Zealand natives in the supply to them of arms and of spirituous drink was unjust to them as British subjects. At the same time, I quite admit that the maintenance of the right of pre-emption by the Crown was, from time to time during the progress of colonisation, open to reconsideration as a matter of public policy. The first duty which devolved on Captain Hobson after his assumption of the government of New Zealand, was to select a suitable site for the seat of government. Many serious considerations entered into the determination of that difficult question. The interests of both races, in other respects than in the commercial aspect, gravely complicated the problem. At first, the selection was in tended to be made in the Bay of Islands, but the want of available land was an insuperable obstacle. The Governor then, recollecting that Captain Cook had, in 1769, recom mended the Hauraki Gulf as suitable for a settlement, visited that fine inlet on the east coast, which lies about one hundred and fifty miles to the southward of the Bay of Islands, and selected a site on the right bank of the Waitemata river, at the south-western corner of the gulf. Land was purchased by the Government from the natives, and on the 19th of September, 1840, the British flag was hoisted at Auckland, the name given to it as the seat of government and as the capital of New Zealand. The selection was approved by the Imperial Government. Impartial consideration leads, in my humble judgment, to the irresistible conclusion that, under all the circum stances, complex and difficult as they were at that time, Governor Hobson made the best choice that could at that time be made. Had he gone to the other end of the North Island, and fixed the seat of government amidst the operations of the New Zealand Company, there would, in all human probability, have been in the north native disturbances, which would have not only placed the European population already living there in extreme and"], [80, "62 FAVOURABLE POSITION OF AUCKLAND. imminent danger, but would have also ruined for many years to come the prospect of colonisation in those parts. As it was, the mere removal of government from the Bay of Islands to Auckland was probably at the root of what is called Hone Heke's war, which destroyed the British settlement at Kororareka, and cost many valuable lives and much money. The intermediate position of Auckland between the powerful native tribes in the Bay of Islands to the north, and those equally powerful, to the east ward on the river Thames, and to the southward on the rivers Waikato and Waipa, was eminently favourable to the Government in its efforts to maintain good relations with the natives. The position of Auckland in a com mercial point of view was excellent. The harbour is one of the most easily accessible and the securest in New Zealand ; there is water communication from both sides of the island \u2014 on the eastern, by the Hauraki Gulf, and on the western, by the harbour of Manukau, the waters of which flow within half a mile of an arm of the Hauraki Gulf, two miles eastward of Auckland Harbour. The extent of valuable land in the neighbourhood and in the interior is considerable, and the natural facilities for inland communication are unrivalled. Thus, to the north, the Kaipara, which almost joins the Waitemata, and the Wairoa, which flows into the Kaipara, are rivers leading through Kauri forest districts almost to the Bay of Islands ; and, to the south, the Waikato, Waipa, and Thames rivers give water communication to the central parts of the island. At the same time, I do not adhere to the doctrine that the selection of a capital, in the first colonisation of a new country like New Zealand, is, when once made, unchangeable for ever afterwards. Circum stances change, as time rolls on and as colonisation progresses ; and I hold that it is quite an open question whether or not at any future period it is advisable, in the public interests as a whole, to make a change of capital, or, to express myself more accurately, to make a change of the seat of government and of the place for the meeting of the legislature. This motive induced the New Zealand Parliament, in 1864, to substitute Wellington for Auck land as the seat of government. Almost concurrently with, but a little preceding, at"], [81, "PROCEEDINGS OF NEW ZEALAND COMPANY. 63 first, the operations of Captain Hobson, the action of the New Zealand Company became a powerful factor in the colonisation of New Zealand. It was the immediate cause of the practical course taken by the Imperial Government towards that object. Further, as will be hereafter seen, it exercised in the future an effective influence in the settlement of three-fourths at least of the whole of New Zealand, and in impressing the stamp of a high tone and character on each community which it created. But it would be idle to disguise the fact that its precipitancy and indiscretion on frequent occasions, and its sacrifice, in later years, of great principles to the greed of gain, caused, in many cases, grave disaster to those to whom it sold land, and, more especially, to those whom it induced to emigrate. My present object, how ever, is to note the effect of its action in the first colonisa tion of New Zealand, side by side with the action of Captain Hobson as the representative of the Imperial Government. The Company had at its head Lord Durham, well known for his mission to Canada in 1838; and its directors were men of weight and influence in politics and in commerce. The chief founder and managing director of the Company, from the date of its formation till 1846, was Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield. He was during that time its moving spirit. The object of the New Zealand Company was to cause New Zealand to be made a British colony, and to carry on within it systematic colonisation. That system was not mere promiscuous emigration, but the discriminate transplan tation of English communities, in all their various gra dations duly proportioned to each other, combined with a mutual adjustment, in fair working proportions, of labour and capital. Colonisation, as distinguished from mere emigration, was the object. The guiding principle in the disposal of Crown lands in a colony, as set forth by its discoverer, Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield, was to sell land at a substantial price, not less than \u00a31 per acre, and to devote its available proceeds to the conduct of carefully selected and suitable immigration, and to the formation of roads and other necessary local public works. The system was admirably conceived, for, if properly administered, it gave permanent and accumulative power"], [82, "64 COLONISING OPERATIONS BY THE COMPANY. to practical colonisation. But its usefulness of course depended on its proper administration. The Company, as we have seen, failed at first in its endeavour to induce the Imperial Government to do any thing ; and accordingly it sent out a colonising expe dition to New Zealand, without, and, it may be said, in defiance of, the authority of the Crown. Colonel William Wakefield, brother of Mr. E. G. Wakefield, was at the head of the expedition as chief agent of the Company, and he was instructed to purchase native land, to acquire information, and to prepare places for immediate settle ment. He arrived, on the 20th of September, 1839, in Port Nicholson, now called Wellington, at the southern extremity of the North Island. In less than three months, he reported that he had purchased a territory as large as Ireland, for which he had paid to natives goods valued at, in round numbers, \u00a39000, and within which he had re served a tenth part of the whole as land exclusively for the benefit of the natives. In the meanwhile the Com pany, in England, without the sanction of the Imperial Government, and without knowing whether Colonel Wake field had succeeded in selecting a site for settlement and in purchasing any land, had sold land in New Zealand, in the shape of land orders, to the amount of more than \u00a3100,000, and had despatched 216 first and second class passengers and 909 labourers as emigrants to New Zealand. The Secretary of State for the Colonies warned the Company of the illegality of its proceedings ; and the Company, on its part, admitted its error, and besought the Government to place a favourable construction upon its motives, and to accord protection to its emigrants. The Company, in fact, forced the hand of the Government. As in the north of the North Island the Government was obliged, owing to the action of the Company in sending out an expedition to New Zealand, to take steps for acquiring the sovereignty of that country, so in the south of that island the further action as the Company entailed on the Government the necessity for interference in the interests of the settlers, who, as British subjects and as innocent third parties, had a just claim to protection. The Government were literally dragged at the chariot wheels of the first colonisation of New Zealand. The"], [83, "65 WELLINGTON \u2014 WANGANUI AND TARANAEI. Company was precipitate, and the Government procras- tinated. This twofold error was followed and overtaken by retributive penalty, but the greatest sufferers, the settlers, as is often the case in this world, were not most to blame. Delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi. Colo- nisation, under the auspices of the Company, at first rapidly progressed. In the beginning of the year 1840, the Company's first emigrant ship arrived at Port Nichol- son, and before the end of that year 1200 settlers were landed. The settlement first formed there was named Britannia, and was situated at the mouth of a small unnavigable river called the Hutt ; but in a few months the exposure of the site to the open sea made it neces- sary to move the settlement to the opposite side of the harbour. The new town was called Wellington. The harbour is excellent and spacious, and its central position is advantageous for commercial purposes. The settle- ment, however, was subject to great natural hindrances. The harbour was walled in by high ranges covered with thick forest ; there was not room for a town on the shore of that part of the harbour where vessels could safely lie ; strong winds were prevalent ; and, except for a few miles northward up the valley of the Hutt, there was at first no room for expansion, and that valley was dense forest. Wharves, reclamation, roads, and clearing off heavy timber were indispensable to progress. In the same year, 1840, the settlement of Wanganui, on the west coast, 120 miles to the north of Wellington, was formed. The site of this settlement was on the river Wanganui, four miles from its mouth. The river is navigable up to the town for craft of ten and twelve feet draught; but, like all rivers on the west coast, it has a bar at the mouth. The native population in the neighbourhood was numerous, and the land was fertile. There was overland communi- cation with Wellington, mostly by the sea-beach and partly by a native path over a wooded range near Welling- ton. Another settlement was formed by the Company in 1841, at Taranaki, on the central west coast of the North Island. The first emigrants came from the English western counties, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, and Hants ; and the majority consisted of agricultural labourers and miners. New Plymouth, as the town was called, is on F"], [84, "66 NEW PLYMOUTH \u2014 NELSON. the coast near the foot of the majestic mountain, Mount Egmont, snow-capped and rising like a cone out of a densely wooded plain. The harbour is a roadstead open to winds from south-west round by north to east-south east. The land in the neighbourhood and along the coast southward was very fertile, and it was partly occupied by many natives. Also, in the same year, 1841, the Com pany formed another settlement, Nelson, at the head of Blind Bay, at the northern end of the South Island. The town is picturesquely situated ; the harbour is good, but the passage into it is very narrow, with a bar on which at spring tides there is a depth of twenty-one feet. The agent of the Company in founding this settlement was Captain Wakefield, R.N., another brother of Mr. E. G. Wakefield. He was a man of great public and private worth ; and his unhappy death in the prime of life at the Wairau massacre in June, 1843, was bitterly lamented by all who knew him. The course of these events at opposite ends of the North Island was fraught with elements which, though their significance was little, if at all, noted at the time, had subsequently a most material bearing on the progress and on the character of colonisation in New Zealand. Amidst all the conflict, there were forces at work which brought permanent good out of the temporary evil. When the turmoil had ceased and the muddy waters had dis appeared there remained a residuum of gold. Two colo nising agencies, the Imperial Government and the New Zealand Company, were busily employed. Between them there was chronic dispute ; and by that dispute the mutual relations of both races in the colony were en dangered and occasionally brought into fatal antagonism, and their interests were seriously injured. Out of this conflict, however, there grew a permanent rivalry between north and south in the race of colonisation. Moreover, in the nature of things as they then were, there was a wide difference in the constitution of both classes of settle ment ; and that difference became in its turn an additional advantage. Besides this great division, there were also subdivisions in the Company's own settlements ; for it had, with admirable foresight, recognized the advantage of individuality of settlement, and, throughout its whole"], [85, "INDIVIDUALITY OF SETTLEMENTS. 67 career, directly and indirectly gave practical effect to that recognition. Unlike the Australian and other British colonies, New Zealand colonisation did not radiate uni- formly from one centre, but from various centres under different conditions. The colonising hand of man in this respect corresponded with the work of nature. Nature has in New Zealand, more perhaps than in any one country of its size, diversified its gifts. The climate ranges from sub-tropical to temperate latitudes, and the contrast between the temperature and the rainfall on the east and west coasts respectively is striking. Many parts of the country were inaccessible except by sea ; there are large tracts where mountains and forests predominate ; others consist of extensive and treeless plains ; others are undulating and of a mixed character ; and there are ex- tensive territories where pasture and agriculture yield their place to mining for gold and mineral treasure. The native population was congregated on the North Island, while in the larger South Island there were only about two thousand natives. And in the North Island itself the number \u2014 say, at the most, about sixty thousand \u2014 was unequally distributed. The creation of separate and independent settlements, peopled by different classes, having little or no communication with each other, uncon- nected in trade, following different pursuits, living under different conditions, acted in the spread of colonisation throughout the country with emulous and cumulative effect. This multiplication of centres was admirably suited to the early colonisation of New Zealand. It is true that the various settlements were jealous of each other, and that they depreciated each other, but all the while they were working to one common end ; and as facilities for mutual intercourse increased, the jealousy subsided, and the means of powerful combination were made available. Auckland was the centre of the colo nisation of the northern half of the North Island. In the south, including the South Island, the New Zealand Company founded in rapid succession, Welling ton, Wanganui, Taranaki, and Nelson ; and in 1847 and 1850 respectively, it indirectly, by arrangement with other associations, founded Otago and Canterbury. There is another characteristic feature of the Company's scheme"], [86, "68 CAREFULLY SELECTED EMIGRATION. of colonisation, for which great credit is due. The emigrants introduced into the colony under the auspices of the Company were of high-class character. Many of those who belonged to the upper ranks of life were well educated, able, influential, and of good social posi tion ; they were made of the stuff which constitutes a good colonist \u2014 men and leaders of men in the true sense of the terms ; those in the lower ranks were, as a rule, very well selected. A stranger, visiting one of the Com pany's settlements, felt himself at once in a British community, considerably above the average standard of quality. This fact has been an invaluable boon. A good tone has pervaded each settlement ; the mind has been fed as well as the body ; and ability and public spirit have been always available for the good of all. Nor has this great blessing been ephemeral. Good work survives its doer, and great qualities are hereditary. Fortes creantur fortibus et bonis. It is impossible to overrate this national advantage, the effect of which is now traceable in every branch of industrial, social, and public life in New Zealand. I do not wish to cast indirectly any slur on the settlement of Auckland, which was not systematically colonised, but grew, as it were, by natural accretion ; but it stands to reason that, in colonisation, good selection, as in the breeding of animals, is a great advantage. It must, however, be admitted that, even in the absence of system and selection, a good class of colonists formed the settlement of Auckland ; and, in after years, their dis tinction of origin, if I may use that term, as between them and southern settlers, was, when a general admixture gradually took place, a benefit to all. It was the new strain of blood which improves and invigorates a race. The early progress of colonisation in New Zealand was beset with difficulties. The Governor, by his selection of Auckland as the seat of government, made the New Zea land Company his bitter opponent, and its influence in England made its opposition formidable. Again, the New Zealand Company was itself involved in serious embarras ment with the Colonial Office and its own settlers, and was sowing broadcast seeds of fatal discord between the two races. The Colonial Office was indecisive and unfore- seeing. The support which it gave to its Governor was"], [87, "69 NATIVE RELATIONS WITH COLONISTS. reluctant and half-hearted ; its attitude towards the New Zealand Company was sulky and irritable ; and it was content to drift in its relation and responsibilities to the natives. The natives themselves in their novel con nection with colonists were in a critical state of transition. Till then the natives patronised the Pakeha, as a rare and curious phenomenon, partly from motives of hospitable wonder and more from hope of mercenary gain ; welcome as a sort of superior being from whom much might be got, but at that time not regarded with suspicion or dread. But when colonisation began, there came a change. Government, the power behind the Pakeha, stepped on the stage ; the control of the relations between both races was not left, as it had hitherto practically been, in native hands, but was administered by a third party directly re presenting the incoming race ; and the progressive settle ment of that race, organised, shaped into being, and instinct with life and energy, went on with sure and resist less pace, and expanded into dimensions which aroused suspicion of coming conquest and forcible dispossession. The colonists, moreover, were a substantial element of complication. In the north, a numerous class of land claimants had sprung up, consisting largely of speculators and adventurers who, in view of approaching colonisation, had claimed to have bought from natives in New Zealand large tracts of land for what, in many cases, was a nominal consideration. As a whole, the practice which had been carried on was thoroughly vicious and fraudulent. Deeds of conveyance, prepared at Sydney, with blanks for boun daries, were sent to agents in New Zealand to be filled up, quocunque modo, at the least cost. Land was bought secretly and from wrong persons ; boundaries were in serted by purchasers after deeds in blank had been signed by sellers ; the same land was sold three or four times ; natives often did not know what they were signing, and sometimes did not care so long as they received coveted goods in payment ; extensive territories, claimed to have been bought, were occasionally defined by degrees of latitude and longitude, or by the compass ; and the purchase-money was a trifle ; the whole trans action was often set forth on half a sheet of paper. The South Island was stated to be bought from a few natives"], [88, "70 ACTION OF GOVERNMENT. visiting Sydney. Land was paid for in many cases with guns and ammunition. Sometimes the price was at the rate of one farthing for every hundred acres. No doubt, there was some land bought fairly and in good faith, but instances of that kind were exceptional. Up to the year 1840, about 26,000,000 acres (not counting the pretended purchase of the South Island, and the purchase made by the New Zealand Company) were thus claimed by private individuals. The purchase by the New Zealand Company, which stands out by itself on much higher ground, amounted to 20,000,000 acres more. Although that latter purchase was quite distinct in character, still there is no doubt that just exception was taken to it for want of due caution in the ascertainment of native titles, and of proper attention to native interests. In the north, then, the old land claimants, as they were called, were agitating for the acknowledgment of their claims ; and some were mischievously endeavouring to use the native element of the question as a means of intimidating- the Government into compliance. The natives were told that the Government wished to confiscate native land, and would begin by appropriating land which natives had sold to Europeans. Unfortunately, the Government gave some colour to this innuendo by adopting the practice of hold- ing as Crown land surplus land which natives had sold to Europeans, but which exceeded the limit assigned by the Government, on grounds of public policy, as the maxi mum to be allowed under Crown grant to any one indi vidual in respect of his land claims. This practice may have been legally justifiable, but it was questionable policy, inasmuch as natives, looking on the Crown as a personality, could not understand how it could justly claim to take land which it had not bought. It would have been more prudent to have paid the former native owners some nominal consideration \u2014 a retaining fee, so to say \u2014 for the public appropriation of land which the natives had disposed of, but which, on public grounds, the European claimant was not allowed to retain. This course would, perhaps, have not been strictly logical, but it would have been practical, and it would have obviated much em barrassment. Again, in the north, a class of land specu lators had sprung up, violent, unscrupulous, and rapidly"], [89, "AGITATION FOR WAIVER OF PRE-EMPTION. 71 increasing, which raised a loud outcry against the Crown's right of pre-emption over native land, and importunately demanded what it called free trade in the disposal of that land. The right of men to do what they will with their own was urged ; and it needed little skill to misrepresent this question in the eyes of many natives, who soon found out that the Crown was not able, from want of funds, to buy all that they wished to sell, thus interposing, while that inability lasted, an insuperable obstacle to those who wished to part with land and obtain money to purchase European goods, especially firearms. In the south, there was no practical difficulty on account of old land claims, or of the pre-emptive right. The purchase by the New Zealand Company could scarcely be considered a private transaction, and after much delay and controversy the Colonial Office came to that conclusion. But the purchase was in itself the cause of grave difficulties. Those who had bought land from the Company many of whom had gone out to New Zealand, claimed to be put into possession of their property. The other emigrants, the many who came out to work for wages and who had been promised employment, claimed the fulfilment of that promise. The precipitate action of the Company, and the protracted con flict between the Colonial Office and the Company para lysed progress. Native claims had not, in many cases, been satisfied ; the survey of much land, still more its occupation, was opposed. The emigrants understood nothing about the natives, their customs, and their titles to land, and had unhappily been imbued with the doc trine, taught by the New Zealand Company and by that political school with which it was closely associated, that the right of the native to land was mostly mythical, and that the treaty of Waitangi was a transparent sham. It is not then wonderful that both in the north and in the south, although from different causes, both races viewed each other too generally with suspicion and resentment ; and that, on the whole, the outlook was gloomy and threatening."], [90, "72 FIRST SALE OF LAND AT AUCKLAND.

Governor Hobson took up his abode at Auckland in January, 1841 ; and the first sale of Crown lands there was held in the following April, and was very successful. The lands were put up to auction, and forty-one town acres were sold at 'an average price of \u00a3.595 each ; and in the following September there was a sale of suburban allot ments and small farms, suburban lots fetching \u00a345 an acre, and small farms \u00a33 an acre. These sales were made under the sign manual, which directed all Crown lands in New Zealand to be sold at a uniform price. After these sales, the Australian Land Sales Act was in force, enacting that all lands should be sold by auction at an upset price of not less than \u00a31 an acre, and that half the proceeds should be applied to public purposes, and the other half to immigration. Soon afterwards, New Zealand was excepted from that Act, and the power of the Crown to dispose of Crown lands was restored. The Secretary of State directed that land should be sold by public auction at an upset price of not less than \u00a31 an acre, but the Governor was given power to bestow land on individuals and public bodies. A commission was appointed under a special Act to inquire into and report on the old land claims, and a maximum extent of land, 2560 acres, to be granted, as a rule, to any one individual, was prescribed ; and it was also enacted that the quantity of land to be"], [91, "73 ARDUOUS WORK OF GOVERNOR. granted within that limit should he regulated by the sum expended in the purchase. Some of the most extravagant claims were never brought before the commission ; many claims were commuted for scrip credit at Crown land sales ; and for several hundreds of them Crown grants were at last issued after much controversy and delay. For many years these land claims kept the northern part of the colony in a state of violent agitation, and gave rise to bitter political feeling ; and even after the lapse of eighteen years some of them had not been finally settled. The position of Governor Hobson in relation to both races was anxious and difficult. The force at his com mand was wholly inadequate to secure peace and order in case of any serious emergency. His instructions from home dealt in generalities, excellent in theory, but inappli cable to practical purposes in the circumstances at the time. Whenever a question came to a practical issue, the answer to it was delayed, evaded, or bereft of meaning by oracular language. The original sin of public depart ments seems to be to avoid responsibility, and to shift it somewhere else. The tradition of each office tends to the rule not to do even a good thing except on compulsion. Time, thought, intellect, all the high faculties of the official mind, are devoted to the task, not of doing what is right, but of escaping blame for what is wrong. As a matter of course, this vicious habit leads to the multi plication of wrong, but that is a trifle so long as a department can run to earth in a voluminous blue-book. Governor Hobson was told to govern the natives by moral force. He was to recognise their customs so long as they were not repugnant to humanity ; but how he was to pro vide against the exception he was not told. He was practically distant in point of time twelve months from the Imperial Government. He was harassed in the colony by the agent of the New Zealand Company, and he was misrepresented in England by its directors and its power ful friends. He was abused by disappointed settlers in the south, and by selfish cliques in the north, and he was beset by continuous apprehension of disaster. He was a brave man struggling in the storms of fate. And he did his duty well. His only serious fault was his prejudice against the New Zealand Company and his persistent"], [92, "74 FIRM AND PRUDENT ADMINISTRATION. neglect of their settlements ; and this fault, under all the circumstances, was pardonable. He had been accustomed all his life to naval discipline, and he looked on the Company as a merchant vessel without a flag and without papers. On the other hand, he did much for the good of New Zealand and of his country. He obtained the cession of sovereignty by treaty from the natives ; his prompti tude saved part of the colony from French dominion ; he purchased for the Crown considerable tracts of land ; he organized and set in motion the machinery of govern ment; he put a stop to the purchase of native lands by private individuals ; he caused to be enacted a body of important laws for the peace, order, and good government of the colony ; he maintained the good faith and honour of the Crown in his relations with the natives ; he treated them with consideration, and his moral influence over them enabled him to enforce punishment for their offences. In these days the patriotic deeds of founders of colonies are either ignored or treated as commonplace. Little con sideration is given to circumstances at the time which really made these deeds historical and heroic. Take for instance the prompt despatch of an English man-of-war to Akaroa, a fine harbour on the south-eastern end of Banks' Peninsula. There is no doubt that it was only by a few hours then that the assertion of French sovereignty in the South Island was prevented. A signal instance of the vindication of law in a native case was the execution of the native Maketu for murder. The culprit was duly tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. He was exe cuted at Auckland, where crowds of natives from distant parts of the country assembled with mixed feelings; for though many of them admitted the justice of his death, there was general indignation ag-ainst the strangeness, and what they considered the cruelty, of the mode of execution. Hesitation or imprudence on the part of the authorities might have led to a terrible catastrophe. As it was, the firmness of the Governor had a wide-spread influence for good in the native mind. Another remarkable feature, while Captain Hobson was Governor of New Zealand, was the enactment of wise and advanced laws on subjects of primary importance. It is most creditable to those concerned that an infant colony,"], [93, "75 IMPOR TANT LEGISLA TION. born and cradled under such troublesome conditions, should be able to begin its career by taking the lead in what were then original and higher branches of legislation. In this great work Governor Hobson was advised and assisted by two able men \u2014 Mr. Justice Martin, afterwards Sir William Martin, and Mr. William Swainson, holding respectively the offices of Judge of the Supreme Court and of Attorney- General in New Zealand. I am glad to be able to quote a descriptive sketch, by one of the authors of this legislation, of its leading principles. In his book on New Zealand and its Colonisation, published in 1859, Mr. Swainson writes as follows (pp. 93, 94, etc.) \" For the few months during which New Zealand con- tinued to be a dependency of New South Wales, the newly founded colony was subject to a code of laws enacted for a penal settlement ; and even after it had been erected into a separate and independent colony in November, 1840, New Zealand continued for a while to be subject to the laws of the convict colony ; for, by an early Act of the New Zealand Legislature, it was provided that, until the laws necessary for its government could be specially framed with that object by the local legislature, all such laws of New South Wales as were applicable to the colony of New Zealand should continue to be in force. Happily, however, the period of bondage was of short duration. Soon came English lawyers, imbued with English spirit, and eager to relieve the colony from the baneful influence of a convict code ; and measures were speedily enacted for establishing courts of judicature, and for providing for the administration of justice, for the establishment of municipalities for the transfer of real property, for the regulation of marriages, and a variety of other important subjects. In the structure of the laws themselves, too, the precedent was established of framing them in simple, con- cise, and intelligible language ; of confining the matter of each clause to a single subject ; of arranging the clauses methodically under appropriate heads ; and of avoiding the prolixity and tautology by which our English legisla- tive enactments were usually distinguished. And not being hampered by any complicated pre-existing system, nor impeded by the opposing influence of a powerful pro fession, the lawgivers of the colony were also enabled to"], [94, "76 AMENDMENTS IN LAW OF REAL PROPERTY. effect amendments in the law, which the British Legis lature has hardly yet succeeded in accomplishing. A simple system of oral pleading, suited to the primitive condition of the community, was established for eliciting the issue in civil actions ; and the form and language of indictments in criminal proceedings were materially amended. Of enactments of a more permanent character, that relating to real property is perhaps the most con spicuous for the boldness of its alterations. Many useless forms and subtleties in this abstruse branch of the law were abolished ; not a few of its rules were amended. eeeeeee ce.ue^ii.TeLice.1 , lieju a. ice. vy\u2014 eei, e lee^.e eee.ie. liuilhuvu. \" Many doubtful points, not even yet well settled in England, were set at rest by declaratory enactment ; and to reduce the length of purchase-deeds, mortgages, and other conveyances, it was provided that a single, short, and simple deed should be sufficient ; and, the more cer tainly to provide against unnecessary prolixity, that pro fessional men should be remunerated according to a prescribed scale of charges, irrespective of the length of the instrument itself. By this means, and by the further enactment that they shall imply the lengthy covenants and provisions in common use, instruments for mortgaging and conveying land in New Zealand have in practice been kept within a moderate compass. These alterations in the law of real property, complemented by a system of registration affording to an intending purchaser or mort gagee an easy means of ascertaining the true state of the title, have done much to render the dealing with real property in New Zealand a comparatively simple and easy transaction. The changes effected in this important branch of the law were of so sweeping a character, as even to attract the guarded attention of the authorities at home. ' Her Majesty would have been advised to con firm and allow the ordinance for facilitating the transfer of real property, and simplifying the law relating thereto,' wrote the Colonial Minister (Lord Stanley), ' had it not been that this enactment introduces innovations of such magnitude and importance, that no opinion of its probable effects, antecedently to the actual trial of the experiment, would seem entitled to much weight. I am gratified in observing how large a range of knowledge and how much diligence have been brought to bear in the structure of"], [95, "77 OPINION OF SECRETARY OF STATE. this ordinance ; nor do I dissent from the learned framer of it in the general opinion, that it is an object of in estimable importance to relieve a new society, in its infancy, when alone it can be relieved, from thraldom to that complex and artificial system of law regarding the acquisition and transfer of real property which has grown up in this country. ... I therefore do not object to this experiment, venturous as it is. But neither am I willing to advise the Queen to sanction it, until I shall be able to lay before her Majesty some surer proof than I can at present command, of the real wisdom of the fundamental changes.' Nor has experience of more than fifteen years suggested any doubts of the wisdom of the changes effected by this great experiment in legislation ; aud the measure has remained almost unaltered to this day. But with the six legislative bodies established in the country by the recent constitution, in addition to the General Assembly, there can be no security for the continuance of uniformity in any branch of the law. The colonists have, however, been warned that there is scarcely any subject on which diversity, or uncertainty, is more carefully to be guarded against than in the law relating to real property ; that it would by no means tend to facilitate the transfer of land, if, in time to come, the title to such property should be found to depend upon what was the particular law at a certain time in a particular district of New Zealand, as to the execution, for instance, of a particular description of legal instrument. Seeing the expense, the uncertainty, and delay which have been experienced in England in the transfer of real property, arising from the existence, in different parts of the country, of a variety of laws, customs, and usages relating to this subject, it has been wisely questioned whether the subordinate councils of the colony ought not only to have been prohibited from making any law for 'regulating the course of inheritance,' but also from making any alteration whatever in the law of real property, or in the transfer thereof. \" Although the seat of government was established in the centre of the great bulk of the native race, and of the European population settled in the north, it soon became obvious that one general central authority could not satis factorily legislate in detail for the several settlements"], [96, "78 MUNICIPAL MEASURES FAILED. almost contemporaneously planted in the country. In addition to the settlements founded by the Crown at Auckland, three settlements were planted by the New Zealand Company at Wellington, Nelson, and New Ply mouth ; all widely separated from each other, and some of them, at that time, distant from the capital a four weeks' journey, or a fortnight's sail ; and one of the earliest enactments of the Colonial Legislature was a comprehensive measure of a municipal character, em powering the colonists to manage their own local affairs, and to provide for the good order, health, and convenience of the public. The measure was based on the principle that the people themselves are best qualified to provide for the management of their own local affairs. It was so framed as to entitle any then existing or future settle ment, whenever its population should amount to two thousand souls, to be erected into a separate munici pality ; and, if cordially accepted by the colonists, it was expected that it would relieve the general Government from a duty which it could but ill perform, and that the progress of the colony generally would be promoted by the honourable rivalry which might be expected to spring up amongst the various settlements, when entrusted to their own local management.\" It is scarcely possible to overrate the advantages con ferred on the whole colony for all time by the first laws, passed in the time of the first Governor, for the simpli fication of legal procedure and of the transfer of real property. Praise cannot however, I think, be awarded to the municipal measures prepared for adoption in the southern settlements, except for good intentions. Neither the Governor nor his advisers had any political grasp of the wants and circumstances of those settlements. The municipal ordinance in question was quite inadequate to those wants and those circumstances. In effect, the southern settlers were left with a mere mockery of general government, and without any real local self government. They never had any genuine government of either kind till, in 1853, they received a full measure of representative and responsible government in the local and genera] legislatures. Unfortunately, the physical strength of Governor Hob-"], [97, "DEATH OF GOVERNOR HOBSON. 79 son was not equal to bis moral courage. Trouble, anxiety, misrepresentation, and abuse did their fatal work on his sensitive temperament and delicate health. He died on the 10th of September, 1842, at the early age of forty nine, after an administration of almost three years. He died, probably, without knowing what permanent good he had done ; certainly, without knowing that time would do substantial justice to his administration. The natives, more than his own countrymen, appreciated him living. \"Mother Victoria,\" wrote a great New Zealand chief, addressing her Majesty shortly after the death of Gover nor Hobson, \" my subject is a Governor for us and for the strangers of this island. Let him be a good man. Look out for a good man \u2014 a man of judgment. Let not a troubler come here. Let not a boy come here, or one puffed up. Let him be a good man, as the Governor who has just died.\" It would serve no useful purpose to give any detailed account of the proceedings of the New Zealand Company, and of its controversies with the Colonial Office, with the Governor, and with its land purchasers and settlers. But inasmuch as the New Zealand Company was a great agency in the early colonisation of New Zealand, I shall endeavour to summarise its action as it bears, from time to time, on that colonisation. While Captain Hobson was busy in the north, the New Zealand Company was fully occupied in the south in founding settlements, and in trying to disentangle, or rather to cut, the knot of its difficulties. Wellington, Wanganui, New Plymouth, and Nelson were successively founded in a very short time ; but, except for the fact that there were immigrants crowded in each small town, as it was called, these were only settlements in name. Expansion was impracticable. Men, young, full of strength, energy, and enterprise, and eager to make homes, were \" cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd, bound in ; \" and were met on all sides by native resistance to the occupation of disputed land. The Company had no title from the Crown, and, owing to the imperfection of its purchases, had no equitable title from the natives. It was unable to meet its responsibilities, and all it did was to excuse itself, and to accuse others. Ill feeling sprang up and grew quickly between both races. The immigrants"], [98, "80 OBSTACLES TO SETTLEMENT. looked on the natives as hostile to settlement, and on their claims as fictitious ; and the natives resented what they felt as the intrusion of strangers. More than once at Wellington, in 1840 and 1841, what would have been fatal collision had been imminent. In 1842, the disputes were so threatening, that the leading colonists became apprehensive, and called together a public meeting to consider the situation. Colonel Wakefield, the chief agent of the Company, declared that he bad done his utmost to put the emigrants into possession of their lands, and had failed. As a last resort, application was made to the Governor. The animosity of the Governor against the New Zealand Company and its settlers at Wellington may be inferred from the fact that when, in March, 1840, the latter, who were left in a state of anarchy, formed, in the interests of peace and order, a sort of provisional government, the Governor construed that proceeding as an act of rebellion, and despatched his Colonial (Secretary, Lieutenant Shortland, R.N., with soldiers, to put it down. Of course, the only issue of this strange expedition was that the Governor did at last what he should have done before, namely, he appointed a police magistrate ; but the incident serves to show the prejudice at work in the mind of the Governor. At Wanganui the state of things was as bad as at Wellington. Occupation of land claimed to have been purchased by the Company was forcibly resisted by the natives. All settlement, in the real sense of the word, was stopped. At New Plymouth there was a complication of difficulties. The original native proprietors of the land in the district had been conquered by the Waikato tribes, and were, in 1839, dispersed over other parts of the island as fugitives and slaves. Colonel Wakefield bought the land from only a small number, about ninety resident natives. Soon afterwards, in 1841, owing to the progress of Christianity and civilisation, the Taranaki slaves were set free by their masters. In the same year, these freed men and other fugitives (about 1000 in all) returned to their old homes, and were astounded at the news that their lands had been sold and parcelled out among strangers. To make the confusion worse, it had been held, that the territorial title vested in the absentee people of Te Whero Whero, a great Waikato"], [99, "NATIVE DIFFICULTIES INCREASING. 81 chief, in virtue of conquest. The question at issue was whether the proprietorship properly belonged, according to native custom, to the absent conquerors, or to the absent conquered, or to the resident remainder, or partly to two or all of them. At all events, those who had returned resisted by force the occupation of their ancestral lands. Here again the immigrants were cooped up, and were unable to do their proper work. At Nelson there was similar congestion. Native claims had not been satisfied, and occupation of land was obstructed. Disputes between the two races were daily occurring, and, in the course of little more than two years, culminated in the tragedy at Wairau. In the mean time the position of the New Zealand Company in England was as bad as it could be. The directors had sold lands to which they had no title ; they had sent out emigrants for whose arrival no arrangement had been made ; and then, to make confusion worse, they were in treaty for the sale to a German Company of the Chatham Islands, and they had the audacity to inform the Colonial Office that they would take care to provide for the due recognition of British vessels in what would in fact be a foreign colony. When brought to book in this matter, as unlawful and interfering with the royal prerogative, they repudiated the whole transaction, which probably was more imaginative than real ; and the issue was so far fortunate that the Imperial Government included the Chatham Islands in the colony of New Zealand. Shortly, the directors of the New Zealand Company found themselves helpless, while the most serious difficulties threatened them on every side. They made an ad miseri cordiam appeal to the Imperial Government ; and, after much dispute and delay, they induced the Government to agree to grant to the Company, out of the land claimed by it, four times as many acres as it had expended pounds in the work of colonisation. According to the terms of that agreement, the -Company would, if its claim to land had been good, be entitled to more than a million acres. But that little \" If,\" which, curiously enough, had been ignored during the negotiation, cropped up afterwards as the reverse of a peacemaker. The assertion of the Company as to the extent and validity of its land a"], [100, "82 NEW ZEALAND COMPANY'S CLAIMS. purchases had been taken for granted. The serious question now arose whether the Crown grant should be made irrespectively of the actual extinguishment of the native title to the land which the Company claimed. The Company contended that the Government were bound, under any circumstances, so long as the condition of expenditure was fulfilled, to grant the stipulated quantity of land. This interpretation was rejected by the Govern ment ; and they reasonably argued that the essence of the agreement was the Company's extinction of the native title, for otherwise the Government would be forced to do it at the cost of the British tax-payer. The real issue was whether the Crown or the natives had a title to lands unoccupied by natives; because if these lands were wastelands of the Crown, as argued by the Company, the Government would have had no difficulty in making, without cost of money, the requisite grant to the Company in proportion to its expenditure in good faith on colonising work, even if all native claims to land supposed to have been bought were not satisfied. This issue involved the treaty of Waitangi ; though not directly, as has been generally supposed. The treaty merely recognised the title of the natives to their lands. The question whether they had a title to lands unoccupied and unused by them was a question of fact, and was not determined by the treaty. Experience, corroborated by the best authorities, has shown that in New Zealand, long before the natives were taught the marketable value of land, they claimed, according to their own custom from time immemorial, all lands, whether occupied and used or not by themselves. That fact, and I believe that I am justified in asserting it as a fact, in effect decides the question ; for whatever was, by customary title, the land of the natives at the time of their agreeing to the treaty of Waitangi, was secured to them in full and undisturbed possession by the distinct promise, and on the good faith, of the British Crown. Those who wish to judge the treaty of Waitangi should clearly apprehend these elements of the question ; that apprehension will probably save them, as it might have saved many others hitherto, much irrelevant controversy. To come back, however, to the Company. The Colonial Office was inflexible, and"], [101, "83 <G. A. SELWYN, FIRST BISHOP. would not do what it held to be a wrong, either to the British tax-payer or to the New Zealand native. At the time of which I am writing, while Captain Hobson was Governor, and for a long time afterwards, the affairs of the Company and the progress of its colonisation were in a state of deadlock. The position of the early colonists who had gone out under its auspices was deplorable, and their rela tions with the native race were in a most critical condition. During this time, and for many years afterwards, the missionaries, as a whole, did good service in the interests of peaceful colonisation. There was no established Church in New Zealand, and no sectarian jealousy. The missionaries carried on native education ; they explained to the natives doubtful questions ; they advised them to accept, heartily and in good faith, the treaty of Waitangi ; they taught them how to fit themselves for the new conditions of life ; they smoothed the rough path of transition ; and they were energetic and active on the side of peace, order, and good government. While Captain Hobson was governor, the Church of England Missionary body welcomed the arrival of the Right Rev. George Augustus Selwyn, the first Anglican Bishop of New Zealand. His great abilities, his devotion to the missionary cause, his self-denial, his energy, his unwearying toil, his wide-spread influence over the native mind, and his other eminent services, have left ineffaceable footprints on the sands of time in the early colonisation of New Zealand. He had qualities and gifts which few possess, and he never spared himself in their use for good. Like other men, he had faults and made mistakes. His strong will was occasionally too unbending, and his impetuous tem perament made him occasionally rash. Vigorous himself in mind and in body, he allowed too little for the weak ness of others. But his character was never tainted by paltry and selfish considerations. He was a noble specimen of physical and moral man. Although later than other missionaries in the field, he laboured more abundantly than them all, traversing on foot the whole breadth and length of New Zealand, unceasing in his spiritual ministration to the native race, and almost delio-hting in danger and privation. His indomitable enterprise in spiritual work led him also in after years to"], [102, "84 CHARGED WITH POLITICAL INTERFERENCE. extend the borders of the mission over Polynesia. His footsteps there have been followed by the late Bishop Patteson, whom Bishop Selwyn specially chose for that pur pose, and who suffered martyrdom in his missionary work, for which he was eminently fitted, and by a son of Bishop Selwyn, now missionary bishop in those multitudinous isles. It has been said, and it is a charge which has been made against other missionaries, that Bishop Selwyn did not confine himself strictly to missionary functions, and that he trespassed on political ground. The charge, so far as it implies blame, resolves itself into the ques tion where the line of division can properly be drawn. And careful consideration, I think, shows that in the circumstances of the colonisation of New Zealand it was not possible for a conscientious missionary to do his duty towards his native flock, if he altogether ignored political questions. The condition of the natives was exceptional. They were taught a new faith, but at the time the daily conduct of their lives was beset with special difficulties arising from new conditions created by the British occupation and colonisation of their country. Political questions, as they are called, were prominent among those difficulties, and not only affected individuals, but involved the welfare and, possibly, the existence of the race. It seems to me as idle, in that case, to separate by a hard and fast line the spiritual from the secular duties of the missionary, as it would be to separate in like manner faith from works. Missionary co-operation with the Government was always welcome, and it is unreasonable to contend that that co-operation should continue when it could not be conscientiously rendered ; and cases occasionally arose when passive silence and inaction on the part of mission aries would be culpable. The relation of the missionary to the native forebade silence and inaction when, in the calm and deliberate judgment of the missionary, the policy and action of the Government were a breach of good faith pledged by the Crown to the native race, and were sub versive of the welfare of that race. I grant that great care should be observed in the selection of matter on which to make this stand, and tact and judgment should be shown in the kind of opposition given ; but, assuming the exercise of caution and prudence in the fulfilment of these"], [103, "LIEUTENANT SHORTLAND, R.N. 85 conditions, I hold that it is as much the duty of a good missionary to guard the native against moral and mate rial wrongs, though they are called political questions, as it is their duty to teach him spiritual religion. It is of course impossible to define beforehand when and to what extent a missionary should interpose in political subjects ; and it is very difficult to make that definition when it seems that an occasion arises. But this I will say of Bishop Selwyn, and of the missionaries generally, that they seldom, if ever, erred on the side of improper oppo sition on behalf of the natives against the policy and action of governments. Of course, in the foregoing remarks, I exclude the idea of advising a native to break a law, whatever it may be. That idea was never implied in the charge, and is obviously indefensible. When Governor Hobson died, the temporary administra tion of government devolved on Lieutenant Willoughby Shortland, R.N., the Colonial Secretary, and formerly first lieutenant on board of a man-of-war commanded by Captain Hobson. As administrator he was unfitted to cope with the difficulties of his office. He nearly pre cipitated a war by interposing forcibly in a native quarrel. This interposition also serves to show the anomalous relation of British sovereignty to the natives. Tangaroa, a chief at Maketu, near Tauranga, had his vessel captured by Tauranga natives for violating a tapu. The crew of the captured vessel hid themselves in the forest, and at last escaped in an English schooner, which they stole from her anchorage in Tauranga Harbour. Shortly afterwards, members of the native tribe which had seized Tangaroa's vessel were, by stratagem, seized, killed, cooked, and eaten by Tangaroa and Tohi (a native chief who had joined him) and their men. Administrator Shortland resolved to attack Tangaroa and Tohi. And here his anomalous position becomes apparent. On the one hand, the Attorney-General, Mr. Swainson, gave his opinion that as neither Tangaroa nor Tohi had signed the treaty of Waitangi, they were not subjects of the Queen and their territories were not included within her dominion, and that it was unlawful to arrest them. On the other hand, the Secretary of State for the Colonies had instructed Governor Hobson not to allow native customs, such as"], [104, "86 BRITISH SO VEREIGNTY \u2014 WA IRA U MASS A CRE. murder and cannibalism, which were repugnant to humanity ; and he had made no exception of any part of New Zealand contingent on the treaty of Waitangi not having been agreed to by the native chiefs in that locality. And, moreover, though that information came afterwards, when the Secretary of State received Mr. Swainson's legal opinion, he indignantly declared it at variance with her Majesty's Letters Patent and Royal Instructions, and that no public officer who continued to express such an opinion could remain in office. Great, however, as this political anomaly was, Mr. Shortland's action, which was inexcusable as a rash and summary resort to force, was, fortunately, arrested before it plunged the colony into war for which it was wholly unprepared. At the critical stage, when collision was imminent, Bishop Selwyn and Chief Justice Martin arrived in the English camp, having passed on foot unharmed through the enemy's camp at Maketu, and strongly urged Mr. Shortland to stay his hand. He wisely took their advice ; and peaceful negotia tion soon settled a quarrel which force would probably have developed into serious war. Unhappily at Nelson, about eight months afterwards, a dispute about land between the New Zealand Company and some natives led to fatal results. The chief agent of the company, Colonel Wakefield, claimed to have bought for the Company a large tract in the Wairau Valley in the neighbourhood of Nelson ; and the native proprietors, the chiefs Rauparaha and Rangihaeta, denied that they had sold the land. Captain Wakefield, the Company's agent at Nelson, fully relying on the validity of the claim asserted by his brother, sent men to survey the land. The natives burnt the survey huts when the men were away ; but, before doing so, they carefully removed and set aside for the owners' use all the surveyors' property, and they did not harm the persons of any of the survey party. Captain Wakefield then obtained a warrant from the Nelson bench of magistrates to arrest Rauparaha for robbery and arson, and Mr. Thompson, the police magis trate at Nelson, eight other gentlemen, including Captain Wakefield, and forty armed labourers went out to execute the warrant. The expedition found Rauparaha and Rangihaeta, with about a hundred followers, in a remote"], [105, "87 WAIRAU MASSACRE. part, of the valley. The magistrate announced to them that he had come to take Rauparaha, as a prisoner, to Nelson for trial. Rauparaha refused to go, stated that the burnt huts were his own property, inasmuch as they were on his land and made from materials taken there from, and expressed his wish that the dispute should be referred to the land commissioner. The magistrate persisted, a musket was fired (whether accidentally and on which side is unknown), and a general fight ensued. The Europeans, most of whom were quite undisciplined and had never before been engaged in fighting, retreated, were scattered, and many were panic-stricken. Nine of them were taken prisoners, and were massacred by the natives in cold blood, and thirteen others had fallen in the conflict. Five natives were killed, and eight were wounded. Among the Europeans killed were \u2014 Mr. H. A. Thompson, police magistrate ; Captain Arthur Wakefield, R.N. ; Mr. G. Richardson, Crown prosecutor at Nelson; and Captain England, formerly of her Majesty's 12th Regiment. There is no doubt that this sad event was in a great measure due to precipitation and imprudence on the part of some of the leading settlers at Nelson ; but, even apart from the fact that they paid the penalty of their fault with their lives, it is only just that great allowance should be made for them. They were placed in a position in which they had no experience to guide them ; they knew next to nothing of the natives, their customs, their character, and their language ; they had been taught to treat them as impostors, and their land claims as fictitious ; and they naturally fell into the mistake that a bold front would be successful. They forgot for the moment that inconsiderate boldness is akin to rash folly, and that circumstances must be taken into careful con sideration before any man can be justified in risking all on the hazard of mere boldness. But at the root of this sad event, the primary cause lay not so much in the conduct of Nelson settlers as in the persistent neglect of the authorities at home to provide sooner for the investiga tion and settlement of the Company's land claims, and in similar neglect on the part of the authorities at Auckland to provide for some kind of effective government in the southern settlements."], [106, "88 SETTLEMENTS ENDANGERED. The immediate effects of the catastrophe at Wairau were for a long time disastrous to the progress of New Zealand colonisation. The two races were still further estranged from each other. The natives in many places became boastful and insolent ; and the settlers, though eager in their demand for vengeance, were more sensible of their precarious position. Enterprise was absorbed in the necessity for self-defence, and immigration from abroad was stopped. The Government were now alive to the necessity of protecting the settlements in the south. There were only about 200 soldiers altogether in the colony, and they were stationed at Auckland. Another company was despatched from Sydney to Wellington. Major Richmond, of the 96th Regiment, was appointed Super intendent of the southern district. The evil effects of the massacre were aggravated by financial depression. The stoppage of colonisation reacted injuriously on private means and on the public revenue. The colonial treasury was exhausted, and the Government were in debt to the amount of \u00a320,000. An attempt to borrow money at Sydney at 15 per cent, interest failed, and bills which were drawn on the Home Government were dishonoured. The sale of Crown lands in 1843 only produced \u00a31600, and there was no money available for the purchase of native land, and for thus adding to the stock of Crown lands. The European population in 1842 numbered 11,092 souls, and was distributed as follows :\u2014 At Auckland, 2895; at Wellington, 3701; at Nelson, 2560; at New Plymouth, 895; at Russell (Bay of Islands), 380; at Hokianga, 263 ; at Wanganui, 200 ; and at Akaroa, 198. The male population exceeded the female in all the settlements, especially in Auckland and in the others in the north. The northern settlements were peopled for the most part by colonists who came from Australia ; and those in the south, by emigrants from the British Isles. Few settlers anywhere were more than fifty years old. Crime was rare. The industry at the Bay of Islands was trade with whaling ships ; at Hokianga, the preparation of timber, chiefly from Kauri trees, for Australian and English markets. At Auckland, there was little done, except living on public expenditure. At Akaroa, a few French settlers were cultivating gardens"], [107, "89 CONDITION OF COLONY. and vineyards. In the New Zealand Company's settle ments, the settlers who had means were unable, as I have said, to occupy their lands, and were living in towns on their own resources. The Company was forced to employ, as it best could, its own labouring immigrants. Food mainly consisted of pork and potatoes. Pork was S^d. per pound, and potatoes were \u00a310 a ton. Beef was Is. 4d. a pound, and was scarce ; mutton was Is. a pound ; fowls, 12s. a pair ; and eggs, 6s. a dozen. For several weeks there was no tea in Auckland. The different settlements had little communication with each other. News between the north and south came at long intervals through Sydney. In 1842, the customs duties amounted for the year to \u00a35496 ; at Russell, to \u00a32585 ; at Wellington, to \u00a38967; at Nelson, to \u00a31350; and at New Plymouth, to \u00a3170. The executive consisted of the Governor; the Executive Council in which the Governor sat, and the other members of which were the Colonial Secretary, the Colonial Treasurer, and the Attorney-General, was a council of advice. The Legislature was a council com posed of the above-named officers and three senior justices of the peace. Crime, as I have stated, was rare ; but the Secretary of State foolishly sent out to Auckland one hundred Parkhurst boys as emigrants, and these boys, who were supposed to be reformed, within one year after their arrival doubled the felony cases tried by the Supreme Court. This was, I am glad to say, the only element of convictism ever officially introduced into the colonisation of New Zealand. There was one thing re markable in an infant colony, scarcely two years old. Nine newspapers \u2014 four at Auckland, two of which were official gazettes, English and Maori respectively ; two at the Bay of Islands ; two at Wellington ; and one at Nelson \u2014 were, in 1842, published in New Zealand. With all its faults and with all its liability to misuse, the press undoubtedly has inherent in it one pervading element which ever makes it the palladium of a free and pro gressive people. That element, publicity, has an enor mous twofold effect for good ; it is \" a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to them that do well,\" and it multiplies open discussion which irresistibly tends to the elicitation of' truth. In 1843, the European population had increased"], [108, "90 RELATIONS BETWEEN BOTH RACES. to 12,000 persons, though in other substantial signs of advancing colonisation there was no improvement, but rather the reverse. Difficulties were now thickening round the solution of the problem of New Zealand colonisation. The excep tional nature of that problem became more and more sensibly felt. A handful of colonists, isolated in small groups at remote places, was forced, in addition to its encounter with the usual hardships of settlement in a new country, to meet with obstacles of no ordinary kind. These colonists, many with wives and children, were surrounded by a barbarous race speaking a strange language, using strange and repulsive customs, possessors of the land, suspicious and prone to resentment, warlike, regardless of life when roused to anger, and furnished with firearms. The colonists themselves were men of peace, unaccustomed to arms, and bent on industrial pursuits ; and the few soldiers stationed in the colony were numerically powerless for conquest, and even inadequate to the general protection of life and property. The Government were incapable of effective action, in case their moral suasion and, what was of much more avail, missionary influence both failed. The precipitation and imprudence of a colonising company had placed two-thirds of the European population in a painful and perilous position. Already a conflict between parties of both races had taken place, and valuable lives had been sacrificed. Financial embarrassment, industrial depression, and general distress prevailed. Scarcely a ray of hope could pierce the deepen ing gloom. But the founders of the colony, few and scattered as they were, were true to the qualities and traditions of their race. They were dispirited but not despondent. They came to make for themselves new homes, and, for England, a new colony, and they did all that in them lay to accomplish that work. The struggle was severe and long, and success, when it came at last, was owing to their heroic persistence. At the critical juncture, when the battle had only begun, in December, 1842, Captain Robert Fitz-Roy, R.N., arrived at Auckland, as successor to Governor Hobson. The new Governor, although an able man in his own profession, was, as the Governor of New Zealand, the wrong man in the wrong"], [109, "91 GOVERNOR FITZ-ROY. place. What was wanted was a man endowed with rare qualities ; with knowledge of, and with ability to rule, men ; with firmness, consistency, prudence ; and with a mind far-seeing and of strong political grasp. Unfortu nately, Governor Fitz-Roy, although he had good inten tions, possessed none of these qualifications. The natural consequence followed. Colonisation sank into still lower depths, and New Zealand became the scene of still more deplorable disaster. His whole administration, from December, 1842, to October, 1845, was a tissue of political faults. I shall only allude to those which more seriously affected the advance of settlement in New Zealand."], [110, "92 QUESTION OF W AIR AU MASSACRE. CHAPTER VI.

The first thing with which Governor Fitz-Roy had to deal was the Wairau massacre. The question was very embarrassing. It was twofold : first, whether the natives concerned should be punished at all ; and, secondly, if so, in what way ? He decided that the guilt of the natives should be condoned, because the colonists were first in fault. The unqualified character of this decision, and the way in which it was given, more than counterbalanced its general correctness. It was mistaken by the natives for cowardice, because, according to their own custom, the land in dispute should have been taken by the Governor as Crown land in payment for the blood of his countrymen. And the decision was made the more offensive to the southern colonists, because it was given with all the appearance of studied insult to the memory of those who had made a mistake, but who had atoned for it with their lives. The general effect of the decision, as it was given, was pernicious; it made the natives more arrogant and more exacting, and it exasperated the colonists in their hostility to the native race. The relations of the colonists with the natives in respect of land were also mismanaged by the Governor. The old land claims, which were in course of gradual adjustment"], [111, "93 NATIVE LAND QUESTIONS. on the lines laid down by law, were reopened by him, and thrown into utter confusion. Crown grants were made, some in direct opposition to the report of the commis sioners who investigated the claims ; others in the absence of all investigation ; others in excess of the maximum limit ; and others with boundaries so vague as to make the grants void from uncertainty. Moreover, in order, as it were, to make the confusion more con founded, the system of native land-dealing, as prescribed by the treaty of Waitangi, was upset. The Crown's pre-emptive right, which, in the interests of the native race and of systematic colonisation, should have been scrupulously maintained, was waived, at first, with a re servation of ten shillings an acre to be paid by the pur chaser to the Crown, and immediately afterwards with the reduction of that reservation to the nominal sum of a penny an acre. As a sample of his mode of adjust ing the New Zealand Company's claims, the instance of those at New Plymouth may be taken. Mr. Commis sioner Spain, who had been sent out by the Home Govern ment to investigate the Company's claims, reported that 60,000 acres had been properly purchased by the Company at New Plymouth. Mr. Spain had decided that the re turned fugitives and slaves, who then formed the majority of the native peeple at New Plymouth, had no right to receive payment for the land. Governor Fitz-Roy re versed Mr. Spain's decision, and adjudged the Company to have only purchased 3500 acres at New Plymouth. It was a moot point whether returned fugitives and slaves brought with them a revived proprietorship in their former land ; but, for practical purposes, the wise course, which could easily then have been taken, would have been to satisfy by a small further payment the disputed claims, and not simply and solely to abrogate Mr. Spain's award. New conditions in a new country need, within certain limits, flexible adjustment to varying circum stances, and it is suicidal, by blindly following an un bending course, to sacrifice the end to the means. The effect of Governor Fitz-Roy's summary action was to paralyse settlement at New Plymouth, as the whole district was then called, and to sow the seeds of strife between the two races there."], [112, "94 DISTURBANCES AT BAY OF ISLANDS. But Governor Fitz-Roy was fated to perpetrate in the north more serious mischief. He brought on the first native war with the Crown, and, with it, disaster to British arms, and the loss of the original settlement of Kororareka. For some time, discontent had been felt by some native tribes at the Bay of Islands,' arising from various special causes, among which may be included the removal of the seat of government to Auckland, the imposition of customs, the consequent decrease of visits of whaling ships to the bay, and an ebb in profitable trade. Other causes, more general, were at work. Chiefs were losing their influence over the settlers, and even over their own tribes ; the penumbra of an un known, and the more dreaded because unknown, power was steadily advancing and overshadowing the native race ; and there were not wanting a few disloyal white men to hint that if the British flag, the emblem of alien sovereignty, were pulled down, the good old times would soon return. Hone Heki, a native chief, once educated at a mission school but afterwards relapsed into heathenism, was the leader of the new movement. He was the more dangerous because of his apostasy, and, as the son-in-law of the great warrior Hongi, he was anxious to achieve similar celebrity. At the same time, there were loyal tribes, headed by Waka Nene, who never swerved in his attachment to the Crown, and who was the first native who actively joined its forces against his own countrymen. A prudent, firm, and consistent course on the part of the Governor would probably have obviated, or would soon have put an end to disturbances. But Governor Fitz-Roy, unhappily, was rash and vacillating. A bickering, on account of a woman in Heki's tribe who had married an European, led Heki to raise a disturbance at Kororareka, to pillage stores, and, what no doubt was his real object, to cut down and burn the Kororareka flagstaff. Governor Fitz-Roy, without attempting negotiation, forthwith rushed to arms, and in hot haste sent for reinforcements from Australia, and despatched an armed force to the Bay of Islands. After landing the force there, he agreed, at, the request of several loyal chiefs, not to begin hostilities, on their promise to pay for another flagstaff, and to be responsible for the future good conduct of Heki. This"], [113, "95 LOSS OF SETTLEMENT AT KORORAREKA. condonation the Governor managed to make absurd. He accepted from the loyal chiefs a few old muskets, which he returned, and he never required the presence and personal submission of Heki, who was close at hand, but was con tent with an insulting letter of (so-called) apology. All the troops were removed from Kororareka ; customs duties there were abolished ; and it was declared, alone among all the New Zealand ports, to be a free port. Shortly afterwards, the news arrived in the colony that a select committee of the House of Commons had de scribed the treaty of Waitangi as an injudicious pro ceeding. Heki made this intelligence a pretext for cutting down the new flagstaff which had been erected at Koro rareka. Again Governor Fitz-Roy incontinently resorted to arms, prefacing his action only by a proclamation offering \u00a3100 reward for the capture of Heki. The flagstaff was again erected, and a detachment of soldiers was left for its protection. Heki became more persistent in bis hostility ; and he was joined by Kawiti, another native chief. They invaded Kororareka, and, in spite of the soldiers, destroyed the new flagstaff. A general fight took place. The European women and children fled to the ships for safety ; and shortly afterwards, to the intense astonishment of the natives, all the male inhabitants, including the garrison of soldiers and sailors, abandoned the settlement, and sailed to Auckland in the vessels in harbour, one of which was an English man-of-war. After its abandonment the town was ransacked and burnt, with the exception of the Roman Catholic Mission station, and some warehouses belonging to Americans, at the opposite end of the beach. During the engagement four soldiers and six seamen was killed, and twenty seamen, soldiers, and inhabitants were wounded; and the enemy lost thirty men. Fifty thousand pounds' worth of property was destroyed in the fall of Kororareka. The unexpected news of the destruction of Kororareka spread alarm throughout the settlements. The plough share was turned into the sword, and the colony became a camp. War had now arisen at the Bay of Islands, and the campaign was conducted with loss and disaster to the British forces. The natives were unable to contend with disciplined troops in the open, but within their forti-"], [114, "96 UNSUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN. fied pahs in the fastnesses of the forest they were able to resist assault, with much loss to the besiegers, and with little to themselves. At Ohaeawai, in an imprudent and unsuccessful attack by a storming party, consisting of 160 soldiers and 40 seamen and volunteers, 34 of them were killed, and 66 were wounded. The enemy numbered about 250 men, but their loss was never ascertained ; it was supposed to be comparatively small. A few days afterwards, the natives evacuated Ohaeawai, and retired more inland to another fortified position. Retreats of this kind are a favourite device in native warfare with our troops, and make it almost impossible to bring fighting to a definite issue. The natives, unencumbered, able with ease to subsist themselves, and thoroughly knowing the country, find these retreats easy enough, while the corre- sponding advance to a British force entails heavy expen- diture, great delay, and considerable danger. The evacuated pah has nothing in it of value ; its abandon- ment was little sacrifice to those who left it, and its occupation is no profit to the captors. At the close of Governor Fitz-Roy's administration, in October, 1845, the campaign in the north was unfavourable to British arms ; and the influence it had throughout the country, in stimu- lating the warlike ambition of the natives and in diverting the colonists from industrial pursuits, was disastrous to colonisation. Already collision had taken place between colonists and natives close to Wellington, and a little war had sprung up in the Hutt Valley. The only redeeming feature in the war at the Bay of Islands was the staunch fidelity of many natives, headed by Tamata Waka Nene, and their active alliance with the troops. The loyalty of that celebrated chief was unwavering at that time and afterwards ; and it is greatly owing to his example and influence that the Bay of Islands has, ever since the close of the war there in 1846, been undisturbed by hostilities, and that its numerous natives have been friendly to Euro- peans and loyal to the Crown. The civil administration of Governor Fitz-Roy was equally characterised by imprudence and vacillation. In the course of a few months, he abolished the customs in one port alone, which he declared to be free, and then everywhere abolished them by declaring all ports free,"], [115, "97 CIVIL ADMINISTRATION\u2014 COLONIAL POLICY. and substituted for the customs a property-tax, which he repealed before it was fully put in force ; and then he reimposed the customs. He threw all monetary matters into confusion by a law authorising the issue of \u00a315,000 of debentures, and declaring them, in disregard of royal instructions, to be a legal tender. The colony was brought by him to the brink of ruin, when, fortunately, the Home Government recalled him, and put an able man, Captain (afterwards Sir George) Grey, in his place. Captain Fitz-Roy may be fairly held responsible for administrative and legislative measures while he was Governor, for he set aside at his will his scanty instructions, and he had at his command an official majority of votes in his Executive Council, whenever he chose to consult it, and also in his Legislative Council, whenever he wished it to pass a law. It is, however, only just to say that the exigencies of his position were very abnormal and difficult, and that guidance from the Colonial Office was either wanting or uncertain. There is one characteristic of colonial administration at home which forcibly strikes an early New Zealand colonist, and probably others in the outlying parts of the empire. It is the principle, if I may call it so, of penny wisdom and pound folly. Everything is done niggardly and with hesitation till a catastrophe occurs ; and then, for a time, lavish prodi gality becomes the rule. A settled policy and the expen diture of a few thousand pounds beforehand would generally obviate the necessity of forced measures afterwards, which entail the expenditure of millions. This is especially the case where colonisation is carried on in the midst of a barbarous race, armed and able to assert itself. Under the conditions of that problem, public policy points to the prevention, rather than to the suppression, of aboriginal insurrection. That prevention may or may not be pos sible, but it is certainly worth a strenuous effort to try to effect it ; and loose, indolent drifting tends directly to the reverse. Parsimony, moreover, at the wrong time is often the broad way which leads to disaster and extravagance. An inactive, but overawing, force is infinitely better, in every respect, than spasmodic attempts to put down dis turbance when it has taken place. And this argument has particular force when, as in the case of barbarous H"], [116, "98 GOVERNOR SIR GEORGE GREY. races, weakness or indecision in our relations with them tempts them to acts of violence, and their temporary success stimulates them to rebellion. In New Zealand, expe rience has over and over again shown that a firm and prudent policy, the outcome of recognised responsibility, and the judicious maintenance of physical force, ready to be actively used, and, therefore, probably never needed for that use, would have been the wisest and the cheapest policy. Probably our normal aberration in this matter is, in a great measure, due to the wrong idea which is generally entertained of party government. Tbe great end of statesmanship is too much held to be the possession of office, and to that end duty is too often sacrificed by both parties. The perverseness of politics leads men in power to evade responsibility, and men in opposition to regard ex penditure which keeps things quiet in remote parts of the empire as needless, and to caip at it as extravagance. Captain George Grey assumed the government of New Zealand at Auckland in November, 1845. He received within three years from that time the title of Knight Commander of the Civil Order of the Bath, and it will be convenient to refer to him from the first as Sir George Grey. He had a most difficult task before him, and he did it well. It cannot of course be denied that he had material advantages which his predecessor did not possess. The very serious position in which that predecessor had placed New Zealand alarmed the Home Government, and means, in the shape of troops and money, which before were not available were afforded to Sir George Grey. But at the same time it must be admitted that Sir George Grey made the most of his means, which at the utmost were, in proportion to their object, small, and that, in restoring the country to its legitimate functions as a colony, he showed, in a large measure, foresight, energy, courage, judgment, and capacity of administration. His first object was to reduce the insurgent natives to sub mission and to establish permanent peace. The campaign, which he renewed at the Bay of Islands, resulted within three months in the defeat of the rebels and in their general submission. In February, 1846, he went with all his disposable force to Wellington, and, after some"], [117, "99 MILITARY AND CIVIL ADMINISTRATION. desultory bush-fighting, he struck effectively at the root of the insurrection by the seizure of Rauparaha, and by confining him as a prisoner on board of a man-of-war. Rangihaeata was pressed hard in his fastness, and his force was gradually dispersed. These signal successes, and the qualities wbich Sir George Grey showed in their achievement, raised him high in native estimation. Neutral natives became allies, and the disaffected sued for peace. His tact in conciliation was as remarkable as his decision when resort to force was necessary. Nor did he ever lose sight of the practical objects of his govern ment. He was prompt to put down insurrection, but he did not pursue warfare to its bitter end. Force was temporary and exceptional ; it was never used in trying to conquer the native race and to reduce it to military subjugation. On the contrary, he was ever ready and willing to make the natives' friends and fellow-workers in the cause of colonisation and in promoting the joint interests of both races. His continuous effort was to subdue the country by encouraging the arts of peace, and by making disturbance difficult. He aided the three great missionary denominations in educating the natives in elementary learning and in industrial pursuits. He devoted a considerable portion of the public funds, in other ways, to the civilisation of the natives. He con structed main roads in the country, and he employed natives and soldiers together in their construction, thus teaching the natives industry, promoting concord, facili tating settlement, and better enabling insurrection, should it again occur, to be suppressed. He adapted legislation to the more effective administration of justice between Europeans and natives, and he did much to extend that administration to native districts. At the same time, he was firm in withholding concessions to the cupidity of persons belonging to both races, when, in his judgment, those concessions were detrimental to native interests. He resumed the Crown's pre-emptive right over native lands, and he interdicted the supply of arms and ammu nition and of spirits to natives. On behalf of the Crown, he bought, so far as the means at his command enabled him to do so, native land for European settlement ; and he made the purchase-money payable in periodic instal-"], [118, "100 CIVIL ADMINISTRATION. ments, thus preventing the immediate dissipation of that money, and obtaining a material security for the good behaviour, for some time at least, of the sellers of the land. He established native hospitals, provided medicine and medical advice for remote native settlements, and formed savings banks for the promotion of native thrift. In thus specially referring to his native policy, I must not be understood to imply that he neglected the colonists. Native tranquillity was essential to colonisation, and I have accordingly put the restoration of that tranquillity in the foreground. He recurred to sound principles of finance. He took steps to put an end to the issue of debentures as legal tender, and to withdraw those already in circulation. He stopped extravagant expenditure, and induced settlers to pursue the industrial occupation of the country, and not to congregate in towns. The southern settlements were no longer neglected. At the same time, it must be admitted that Sir George Grey was unpopular with the colonists,, especially in the north. At Auckland, his financial reforms, and his persistent hostility to what was falsely called free trade in native land, and to those who had largely profited by old land claims and by penny an-acre claims, made him obnoxious to a noisy and influen tial class of agitators. Moreover, there is no doubt that his too great tendency to personal pertinacity in his contention with opponents, and to representing them in dark colours, unnecessarily aggravated individual animosity against him. Although in the south his administration was much better appreciated, he was not popular with a large class of settlers who were eager for the immediate possession of representative institutions, and who believed that he was clinging to autocratic power, and was unduly withholding the boon of self-government. A change of Ministry at home had changed the fortunes of the New Zealand Company. Lord Grey, who had, as Lord Ho wick, been chairman of a select committee of the House of Commons wbich had, mainly under his influence, expressed their opinion, by a narrow majority, that the Company had sustained injury from the Government and was entitled to redress, came into office as Secretary of State for the Colonies. He reversed the policy of his predecessor, and passed a measure through Parliament"], [119, "101 NEW ZEALAND COMPANY. vesting in the Company for colonising purposes the whole of the demesne lands of the Crown in the southern part of the North Island, and in the South Island, the whole of which, with certain exceptions for the use of its few native inhabitants, Sir George Grey had acquired for the Crown. This Act also granted to the Company, in addition to a previous loan of \u00a3100,000, a further loan of \u00a3136,000; and finally, provided that if the Company should find itself unable to continue its proceedings with profit to itself and with benefit to the colony, it should wind up its affairs, be freed from all liability to repay these loans, and receive a charge, in its own favour, of the sum of \u00a3268,370 on all future land sales of Crown lands throughout all New Zealand, the Crown receiving as an equivalent the lands which the Company claimed to have acquired and to have been entitled to ; the demesne lands vested conditionally in the Company also, of course, reverting to the Crown. This arrangement is another instance of indecision and parsimony followed by precipitation and prodigality. Had the Government at first taken a definite line of policy, and treated the New Zealand Company with proper con sideration, there would have been no call, in its case, for inconsiderate extravagance afterwards ; and probably the interval of paralysis to settlement and of disaster to emigrants would never have taken place. As it was, the character of this arrangement is properly described in a report of a select committee of the New Zealand House of Representatives, in 1854, on the subject. The committee felt assured that the House would disavow with perfect truth and conviction any desire to repudiate a claim which the Company could fairly establish against the colony in virtue of property surrendered to it. But with equal justice and conviction they concurred that it became the colony to protest against a debt, which, on the Company's own statement, was proved to be utterly fallacious, and by the operation of which the colony was burdened with the payment of a large debt, a very considerable proportion of which was certainly unrepresented by any assets. The committee also protested against the injustice of charging this debt not only upon Crown lands within the limits of the Company's own colonising operations in the south, but also upon Crown lands in the province of Auckland, with"], [120, "102 NEW ZEALAND COMPANY \u2014 OTAGO. respect to which, as the committee added, the Company never had any relation, excepting that of repug-nance and hostility, any more than if that portion of New Zealand had been a distant colony, or a part of New South Wales. Another committee reported its opinion that the province of Auckland ought in justice to be immediately relieved from bearing any portion of this debt. I may as well say here that the ultimate result was that the colony paid to the Company the sum of \u00a3200,000 in full discharge of all demands; that the Imperial Government guaranteed a loan raised by the colony for the purpose ; and that the colony arranged, as far as it could, the burden of this loan so as to relieve the province of Auckland from its pressure. The New Zealand Company before its dissolution in 1850 was indirectly the parent of the two settlements of Otago and Canterbury, now among the most flourishing settlements in New Zealand. The settlement of Otago was originally founded by a Scotch association for the special purpose of promoting the emigration of members of the Free Church of Scotland. A block of 400,000 acres, near the south-eastern extremity of the South Island, was purchased from the New Zealand Company. The first emigrants, led by Captain William Cargill, an old soldier of the Peninsula and belonging to a celebrated Scotch family, arrived in March, 1848. The early settlers en countered and overcame considerable hardships. On the first anniversary of the settlement, the total population was 745, of which 426 were males and 319 females. Unskilled labourers' wages were 3s. and 4s. a day ; beef was 6d. a pound ; bread, lOcl. the four-pound loaf ; potatoes, \u00a34 a ton. The exclusive character of the original settlement soon disappeared, though its prevail ing nationality has always been Scotch ; and Otago became in 1853, under the Constitution Act, a province comprising all that part of the South Island which is to the south of the river Waitaki. Like Otago, Canterbury was originally founded as a special settlement. The Canterbury Association proposed to establish a Church of England settlement, and made an arrangement with the New Zealand Company for that object. The site selected was in the vicinity of Banks' Peninsula, on the central eastern coast of the South Island. The first"], [121, "CANTERBURY\u2014 EARLY DAYS. 103 settlers landed in December, 1850. Any idea, if it was ever seriously entertained, of exclusive colonisation was speedily abandoned. The scheme of the association was, however, in two respects eminently successful. There was created a magnificent system of endowments for ecclesiastical and educational purposes, and the settlers brought together were, as a body, remarkable for intelligence, moral worth, and industrious energy. Many of the leading men had high social position and great literary attainments. The good tone which the efforts of the Canterbury Association thus gave to the new community was of inestimable advantage, and a precious possession for all time. The Rev. R. B. Paul, in the second of his series of \" Letters from Canterbury, New Zealand,\" published in 1857, gives the following graphic account of the early days of the settlement: \u2014 \"The first batch of colonists landed, as I have said, on the 16th of December, 1850, and were welcomed by Sir George and Lady Grey, who had come down from Wellington to receive them, and by Mr. Godley, the agent of the Canterbury Asso ciation. Arrangements had been made for their accom modation in several large buildings ; so that every settler was sure of finding shelter until he could provide some sort of habitation for himself. On the 3rd of January, 1851, the Bishop of New Zealand arrived in his little schooner yacht, the Undine, and was followed in February by the Rev. Thomas Jackson, Bishop-designate of Lyttel ton, on a visit to his future diocese, which he soon quitted, never to return. Considerable progress was now made in public works. A bridle-path over the hill at the back of Lyttelton, 1100 feet high, served as a means of communi cation between the port and the plains for foot passengers and horses, the road being continued from the foot of the hills to the river Heathcote, where a horse-ferry was established in order to connect it with the high-road leading to Christchurch, of which the portion from the ferry to the town was soon completed. At Christchurch, a very neat wooden building was opened as a church and schoolroom ; a land office was also built, and two parson ages, one in the valley of the Heathcote, and the other (now used as a grammar-school) at Christchurch. One of the emigration barracks was neatly fitted up as a"], [122, "104 CANTERBURY \u2014 EARLY DAYS. school and church at Lyttelton. In the following year (1852), a bridge was built over the Avon at Christchurch, and a ferry established on the Waimakariri (Courtenay). A considerable sum was also expended in opening up the country by the construction of roads in different directions. Lands now began to be enclosed, and large sums were invested by the settlers in the purchase of sheep and cattle, brought principally from Australia and Van Diemen's Land. Seven hundred thousand acres of pasturage were rented from the association within the Canterbury block (i.e. between Double Corner and the Ashburton river), and application was made to the Government for a still larger quantity outside the ' block.' During this year, five more vessels were sent out by the association, bringing 580 passengers, a number supposed to he just sufficient to supply the places of those who had been attracted to Australia by the fame of the newly discovered gold diggings. For a time, however, the progress of the settlement, which had been rapid beyond all precedent, was checked by the steady efflux of able-bodied men ; but at length the tide began to turn, slowly at first and almost imperceptibly, but with an increasing force, which is bidding fair to place the colony in a better position than ever, as far as the supply of labour is concerned. It has been calculated that in the November of this year, the population of the whole district was 3400 Europeans and 200 natives. Five thousand acres of land were fenced in, of which 1200 were in cultivation. There were in the district about 50,000 sheep, 3000 head of cattle, and 300 horses. In the town of Lyttelton there were 170 houses and 580 inhabitants ; and in Christchurch, 200 houses and 600 inhabitants. In the year 1853, Canterbury was proclaimed (under the Constitution Act of 1852) one of the six provinces of New Zealand. Mr. James Edward Fitzgerald, one of the earliest settlers, was elected eSuperintendent of the province, and also representative for the town of Lyttelton in the General Assembly ; and at the same time twelve representatives were returned to the Provincial Council, a number which has since been augmented to twenty-four. Early in this year, a settle ment was formed on the banks of the Waimakariri and Cam, near the native village of Kaiapoi. A very neat"], [123, "AUCKLAND \u2014 PENSIONER SETTLEMENTS. 105 church was also built at Papanui, chiefly through the exertions of Mr. W. G. Brittan. During this year, six ships of about 3821 tons arrived at Lyttelton from England, fifteen ships of 5292 tons from Australia and Van Diemen's Land, and forty-eight vessels of 2343 tons from the other settlements of New Zealand, making a total of sixty-nine vessels and 11,456 tons. A weekly market was established at Christchurch, and a cattle show held, at which prizes were awarded to the extent of \u00a3106.\" In 1847, special colonisation was also taking place in the neighbourhood of Auckland. Four settlements of a military kind were in course of formation from seven to fourteen miles round Auckland. The settlers were dis charged soldiers enrolled in England for seven years' service in New Zealand. Each man had a cottage and an acre of land, which became his own, with a claim for four acres more at a low price on the completion of his seven years' service. Officers had a house and forty acres of land, and the right of pre-emption over one hundred acres more. The first detachment of these military settlers arrived in October, 1847, and in a few months there were five hundred men, and, including their wives and children, two thousand souls. The men were subject to occasional drill, and were liable to be called out at any time for garrison duty. The success of these military settlements was undoubted, both in a defensive and in a colonising point of view. The Auckland district was occupied, in good strategic positions, by men disciplined and accustomed to arms ; and the men themselves, and their families, became, as a rule, good colonists. One pensioner on completion of his -service bought an officer's house and land, and all purchased their five acres of pre-emption land. Although distinctive and exclusive settlements in respect of creed and nationality are, in my opinion, indefensible, there is no doubt that some other specialty of purpose, and a careful method, settled beforehand, of conducting colonisation, tend much to the successful formation of settlements. These conditions give fibre and consistency to the settlements, and create good-fellowship and hopeful energy among the settlers. Colonisation and"], [124, "106 EARTHQUAKE AT WELLINGTON. its handmaid, Emigration, are intellectual and laborious works of art, and not merely the promiscuous concurrence of adventurous atoms. Until the whole existing system is radically changed, as I think it should be, my view is that the formation of new settlements is likely, under certain conditions, to be better managed by companies formed for the purpose than by Governments. But I shall have more to say on emigration in my concluding chapter. The wise and energ-etic administration of Sir George Grey did wonders. Order and tranquillity took the place of confusion and disturbance; the natives advanced in material welfare, and acquired useful knowledge and habits of industry ; the Europeans were busy in de veloping the resources of the country ; and emigration again flowed into New Zealand. Circumstances, however, beyond the control of Sir George Grey, seriously checked the progress of colonisation. In 1848, a violent shock of earthquake took place at Wellington, destroyed many buildings, and created a panic among the inhabitants. Fortunately, the loss of life was small, only three persons being killed. The alarm was so great that many thought at the time that Wellington must be abandoned. This idea very soon passed away, but the alarm produced an impression greatly prejudicial to the progress of colonisa tion in the southern settlements, at most of which comparatively slight shocks had been occasionally felt. Again, about this time news arrived of the discovery of gold in California ; and nearly one thousand able-bodied settlers left New Zealand for San Francisco. Disappoint ment ultimately caused most of them to return ; but in the mean time the effect was almost fatal to the advance of the colony. At this juncture, an offer to send out convict labour to New Zealand was received from Earl Grey, Secretary of State for the Colonies. The acceptance of the offer would, by relieving the want of labour, and by bringing into the colony a large imperial expenditure, have enormously raised for a time the reduced value of property. But the temporary relief would have been bought at a fearful price ; and it is highly creditable to the colonists and the natives that they unanimously rejected, the offer with expressions of abhorrence at the"], [125, "107 NEW CONSTITUTION, 1817\". idea of their country being used as a receptacle of convicts. A policy more unjust and more disastrous to both races in the colony than that of sending out convicts from Great Britain to New Zealand can hardly he conceived. Lord Grey, who was then afflicted with mischievous mental activity in respect of New Zealand affairs, as shown by his profligate and unjust arrangement with the New Zealand Company, and by his proposal to make New Zealand a convict colony, had also turned his attention to its future constitution ; and, as usual, made his plan without previous consultation with the Governor. This independent action is the more remarkable, because Lord Grey, as his published writings show, had a great confidence in Sir George Grey ; and can only be attributed to egotism, and a morbid idea that he could play by himself the part of a great colonial reformer. His constitutional scheme was embodied in a royal charter, and in an Act of Parliament ; and was actually, I believe, on its way to Sir George Grey when he first heard of it. The colony was divided into two provinces, and provision was made for appointing a Lieutenant-Governor of each, for granting provincial representation, and also for a Governor-in-Chief of the whole colony, and for a colonial Parliament, including a Representative Chamber. The franchise was limited to those who could read and write in the English language ; thus practically disfranchising the native race, many of whom could read and write in their own language, but, probably, not a dozen of male adults of whom could read and write English. This charter was accompanied by a long despatch elaborately attacking the treaty of Waitangi, and instructing the Governor not to recognise, except in case of specific promises, native proprietary right over waste lands unoccupied and unused by natives. The constitution and the despatch together may be characterised, so far as the natives were concerned, as the box of Pandora without hope at the bottom. Anarchy and disinheritance were to be then- lot in life. Fortunately, Sir George Grey was Governor of New Zealand. Had there been at the time a weak and foolish man at the helm, a war of races would probably have taken place. Sir George Grey at once earnestly represented the danger of giving practical effect"], [126, "108 NEW CONSTITUTION, 1852. to this new constitution ; and, on his urgent recom mendation, the whole of it, excepting a few incidental and innocuous parts, was suspended for five years. The inflammatory despatch on native rights to land was explained away in a non-natural sense ; and assurance was again given by the Governor that native rights to land, as hitherto recognised, would be scrupulously respected. And so far all went on well. It is to the credit of Earl Grey that he quietly gave way both with respect to his constitution and his theory of native land proprietorship. He had come too near the brink of the precipice, and in his heart he must have been thankful that a firm hand had pulled him back before he fell. The personal government of Sir George Grey went on substantially the same. Mr. E. J. Eyre came from England under the new constitution as Lieutenant- Governor of the southern province of New Zealand ; but his position was anomalous, and his rule nominal. The legislative bodies, colonial and provincial, contained no representative element, but consisted partly of official, and partly of nominated members. Sir George Grey took care this time to be beforehand with a plan of a new constitution. He prepared, with great care and ability, a draft constitution which he sent to the Home Government. His proposal, with a few alterations, was adopted, and, in 1852, was embodied in an imperial statute. This constitution was as liberal as it well could be in the case of a colony. The Colonial Legislature consisted of the Governor, the Legislative Council, and the House of Representatives. The Legislative Council was composed of members nominated by the Crown for life. This nomination was the main change from what Sir George Grey had proposed ; his proposal, much better in my opinion, being that legislative councillors should be, from time to time, elected by Provincial Councils. The House of Representatives was elected for five years, and was subject to dissolution by the Governor at any time. The franchise, a small holding of or interest in property of house or land, was liberal to Europeans, but in law it was held practically to exclude the bulk of the native population, because the general native tenure of land did not legally come within the term \"property.\""], [127, "109 NEW CONSTITUTION, 1852. The number of members of the House of Representatives was proportionate to the number of electors throughout the colony. The Legislature was empowered generally to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the colony, provided that they were not repugnant to the law of England, that they did not levy duties on the supplies of Her Majesty's forces, and that they were not at variance with imperial treaties. Acts were subject to disallowance by the Queen within a limited time ; and, in a very few cases, they were required to be reserved for the signification of her Majesty's pleasure thereon. Except in regard to certain payments specially authorised by the Constitution Act itself, the whole revenue was made subject to the control and appropriation of the Colonial Legislature ; but any revenue unappropriated was made divisible among the provinces in like proportion as the gross proceeds of that revenue should have arisen therein respectively. The Legislature was also given, with a few exceptions, full power to alter the constitution of the colony. This power, supplemented afterwards by special Imperial Acts, has from time to time been largely acted on. The colony was also divided into six provinces, each of which was authorised to have an elective Superintendent, and an elective Provincial Council. In each case the election was for four years, but the power of dissolution at any time was vested in the Governor ; and on its exercise, a fresh election both of the Council and of the Superintendent was requisite. The Super intendent was to be elected by the electors of the whole province ; and the members of the Provincial Council, respectively, by those of convenient electoral districts. The franchise was the same as for the election of the House of Representatives. A qualification to vote in any casa wa-s also a qualification to be elected. Acts of Provincial Legislatures were subject to disallowance by the Governor, or, when reserved, to the signification of his pleasure thereon. Certain subjects, namely, customs, superior courts of law, coinage, postal service, lighthouses, Crown and native lands, etc., were exempted from provincial legislation. On all other matters Provincial Legislatures could make laws for the peace, order, and good government of their respective provinces, provided"], [128, "110 NEW CONSTITUTION INAUGURATED. that these laws were not repugnant to the law of England ; but any law which they made was liable to be overridden or modified by any Act of the Colonial Legislature in consistent therewith. The Superintendent was given no special administrative powers. Responsible government, in the case of the Governor, was not mentioned, but very properly was left to the natural process of self-evolution from the representative system. The inauguration of the new constitution devolved on Sir George Grey. And here I am reluctantly compelled to find serious fault with the course which he took in the fulfilment of that duty. He brought in the constitution provincially, head hindmost, and improperly forestalled the constitutional action of the Commons of New Zea land in Parliament assembled. He forced into premature activity the Provincial Councils and Superintendents, and, by not summoning at all the Colonial Legislature, made it a dead letter. He arbitrarily localised revenue and adminis tration, the tendency of which was to strip the general Government of power, and to exaggerate the power of the provinces. It is quite true that New Zealand was sadly in want of local self-government ; and it is probable that in England local government preceded and was the parent of Parliament. But the analogy between England and New Zealand in that respect does not hold good in the case under consideration. In England the constitution was unwritten, and it evolved itself by the process of natural selection. In New Zealand the constitution was set out at length in black and white ; and supreme power in the colony was vested in the Colonial Legislature, which included elected representatives of the people. It seems to me therefore obvious that the only legitimate mode of giving effect to that constitution was to summon the supreme Legislature, and to give it the opportunity of taking, as it thought fit, the necessary steps for the pur pose. As an estate of that Legislature, the Governor could exercise his constitutional functions, but he had no right, outside it, to deal with matters of policy which properly should be dealt with by the whole Legislature of the colony. This course of first setting into motion the provincial systems, and of endowing them at his own will with means and functions, was, I venture to say, unjust and impolitic."], [129, "NEW CONSTITUTION INAUGURATED. Ill It was like placing the coachman under the control of his horses, or like substituting the crew for the captain in the navigation of a ship. It is no answer to say that his policy was subject to alteration afterwards by competent autho rity, when the Colonial Legislature met. There are steps in the exercise of political power which, when once taken, can never be altogether, if at all, retraced, but which inevitably lead into almost endless complication. The steps taken by Sir George Grey in bringing the new con stitution into force fall within that category. The pro vinces and the colony were respectively ranged in hostile camps, and for more than twenty years internecine political contest took the place of what might aud should have been harmonious co-operation in the colonisation of the country. The progress which New Zealand made during that time was under the great disadvantage of this civil discord, and would have been immeasurably greater had that discord never existed. Sir George Grey left New Zealand at the end of December, 1853 ; and the Colonial Parliament was summoned by his temporary successor, Colonel Wynyard, to meet in the following May. Another step which Sir George Grey took before he left New Zealand was one of doubtful legality, and of unfortunate issue in the interests of colonisation. He made of his own motion new land regulations, in which the price of Crown land was reduced from a pound to ten shillings, and, under certain conditions, to five shillings an acre. His intention was to enable men of small means to obtain and cultivate land of their own ; but that good intention was frustrated by the facility with which run holders and speculators were enabled to make use of the regulations in acquiring for themselves, at small cost, enor mous territories which effectually shut out the poor man from what was originally intended to be for his benefit. Crown land for the purpose of colonisation should either be sold at a high' price, under stringent conditions as to the appropriation of the proceeds for colonising purposes, such as emigration and roads, etc., or it should be sold at a nominal price, or even given away in certain circum stances, under equally stringent conditions precluding monopoly of large tracts for speculative, or even for"], [130, "112 LAND REGULATIONS, 1853. merely pastoral purposes, and ensuring the improvement and actual settlement of the land by a large class of small land-holders. In mentioning these two alternative courses, I do not wish to exclude the possibility of a judi cious combination of both, each supplementing and aiding the other in promoting the welfare and progress of a colony. Experience has shown how difficult it is to pre vent evasion of land regulations for combining cheap land and actual settlement ; and it soon became evident that Sir George Grey's land regulations had made no satis factory provision for preventing evasion, and that they were easily abused for an object the very reverse of their author's intention. It would have been a more constitutional and wiser course to have left the passing of land laws in the hands of the Legislature, in which the representatives of the people of New Zealand had a poten tial voice, and where everything said and done would be subjected to public discussion and to responsibility to public opinion. The general condition of the natives and the colonists at the close of Sir George Grey's administration requires a few words. The condition of the natives was very satis factory. Peace prevailed in every district. The natives in the neighbourhood of towns and in the remote interior were learning the use of, and were acquiring for them selves, ploughs, flour-mills, and other industrial appli ances. Many natives were the owners of horses, cattle, and sheep ; native churches were numerous ; and some chiefs lived in weather-boarded houses. Canoes were no longer used for purposes of war, but became useful vehicles of trade along that wonderful system of internal navigation to which I have already referred ; and, on the coast, small vessels, from ten to forty tons burden, were owned and navigated by natives for the same pur pose. In 1853, the sum of \u00a36000 was invested in flour mills by natives living within fifty miles around Auckland. The amount of native produce brought in canoes to that town had nearly trebled itself in value in two or three years. Near Wellington many natives were the possessors of houses, cattle, and sheep, were cultivators of wheat, and owners of small vessels. At Taranaki, William King, a native chief, owned, as the representative of his tribe, a"], [131, "113 CONDITION OF COLONY, 1853. considerable number of horses, cattle, carts, ploughs, and harrows. On the whole, throughout the greater part of the North Island, heathenism was disappearing, and educa tion and civilisation were making substantial progress. Sir George Grey had recognised the importance of teach ing natives the English language, and he had granted to schools large endowments of land, \"so long as religious education and industrial training and instruction in the English language shall be given to the youth educated therein and maintained thereat.\" \u25a0Criminally, the judicial records bore very favourable testimony to the conduct of the natives ; and their growing resort in civil cases to English courts of law showed their increasing confidence in our administration of justice. Unarmed Europeans traversed on foot the length and breadth of the country on tours of pleasure or business with perfect security, and were received by natives with kindness and hospitality. The condition of the colonists was also prosperous. Sturdy bands of settlers at Auckland, Taranaki, Wa nganui, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, and Otago were working, in emulous rivalry of each other, steadily and industriously in making homes for themselves, and in pre paring the way for others to do the like. Each commu nity was integral in itself, and was the living centre of an ever-widening circle of industrial civilisation. The effect while fair play was given to this seven-fold colo nising power was astonishing. Seven small colonies, if I may so term them, were separately working, each in its own way, towards one common end, namely, the creation of one large colony. There was in this case, as in the manufacture of a pin, division of employment and combi nation of labour. The collective European population in 1854 was, in round numbers, 32,000. The principal occu pations were commerce, pasture, and agriculture ; and the chief exports were wool, flax, Kauri gum, potatoes, and timber. The colony was at the close of the year 1853 in a state of actual aud progressive welfare. The foregoing account may be taken as a rough sum mary of the general condition of New Zealand at the end of Sir George Grey's administration, from October, 1845, to December, 1853, and on the eve of representative institu tions. Making every allowance for extraneous aid, it I"], [132, "114 CONDITION OF COLONY, 1853. must be admitted, on impartial consideration, that the favourable contrast between the state of New Zealand at the beginning and at the end of that administration was mainly attributable to the prudence and energy of Sir George Grey."], [133, "REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS. 115 CHAPTER VII. Representative institutions \u2014 Isolation of natives \u2014 Responsible gov- ernment \u2014 Exceptional administration of native affairs \u2014 Disturb- ances at Taranaki \u2014 Colonial and provincial policies \u2014 State of New Zealand on eve of war of 1860. An important epoch in the history of New Zealand arrived with the new year, 1854. Personal government was at an end, and a very capable administrator of it had just gone away. Representative institutions took its place. This critical juncture will be better understood, if the reader pauses for a few moments to think on the diverse effects which the gift of those institutions, as they stood, would have respectively on the colonists and the natives. To the colonists generally personal government had been more or less repugnant. Even while its administration had been bearing good fruit in the restoration of peace and in the growth of prosperity, it had provoked much resentment, founded, in the minds of some persons, on the low ground of selfish disappointment in their personal interests ; and, in the minds of many, on the higher ground of autocratic rule being opposed to constitutional government, and of a natural preference of a great prin ciple to any contravention of it, however exceptionally splendid. Representative institutions were, therefore, almost universally welcome to the colonists. Men with grievances thought they would be more likely to get satis faction, and men who looked forward to higher and nobler objects hailed popular representation with delight. Especially so, when, as in this case, self-government was, so far as the colonists were concerned, of a comprehensive and liberal character in matters both of general and local"], [134, "116 EFFECT OF NEW INSTITUTIONS ON NATIVES. interest. The shield, however, had two sides ; and, from the native point of view, the reverse side had a very dif- ferent aspect. Personal government had been to the native race a valuable boon. It was in conformity with native usage ; and it enabled a native to get personal access to the Governor, a patient hearing, and often immediate satis- faction. The natives understood, appreciated, and sensibly profited by the personal rule of the Governor. But a sudden and complete change came when the representa- tive system displaced that personal rule. They could not understand why the Governor, who had hitherto been supreme, should at once become practically subordinate. They quickly found out that he could not give his own decision, but that he must consult and defer to the opinion of others. This reduction of the Governor to a consti- tutional cypher was unintelligible to them, degraded him in their eyes, and was fraught, in their case, with danger- ous elements. They knew nothing of representative and responsible government, or of party politics. Moreover, their sense of helplessness and isolation was aggravated by the fact that the new system made no proper provision for their government. The franchise given, as interpreted by the law officers of the Crown in England, condemned in effect the great bulk of the natives to anarchy, or at least handed over their government to an alien race. They had no art or part in representative institutions, either general or provincial. The Constitution Act, it is true, made a reserve of a certain sum, \u00a36000 per annum, to be expended by the Governor for native purposes ; and also contained a clause enabling their own laws and customs, when not repugnant to humanity, to be maintained in native districts. But both these provisions were utterly inadequate to the occasion. The sum was insignificant, and its expenditure soon came practically under the control of the responsible Ministry ; and the reservation of native customs, in any true and genuine sense of doing good, was impracticable ; its adoption would have been a sham of native self-government, and would have been antagonistic to the amalgamation of the tw.o races. Even slight reflection shows the importance of the crisis which had arisen. Two nations inhabited New Zealand ; one was aboriginal, and the other had emigrated to the country."], [135, "117 NATIVE SUSPICION AND DISCONTENT. The aboriginal nation, then comprising the majority of inhabitants, was left, politically and socially, stranded on the shore, while the other was carried by the tidal flood which leads on to fortune. Another strong impulse to native disaffection was the feeling entertained by many leading natives that native territory was fast slipping away into the hands of the stranger. No just complaint could be made of fraud or oppression. In every case the owners agreed to part with the land sold at the price paid. But there was an instinc tive feeling that the influence and money of the Crown, which was the exclusive purchaser, exercised too often irresistible pressure; and that, in too many instances, large tracts of lands and the purchase money which had been wasted had both gone for ever from native possession. Moreover, the system of peripatetic agents of the Crown continually teasing native owners to sell land, and of those agents themselves practically deciding who had and who had not a right of ownership over land offered for sale, was vexatious to the native mind. An uneasy apprehension prevailed in some native districts ; and, as early as in 1854, at Taranaki, a league, bound not to sell any more land, was formed among some of the tribes there. Taking these circumstances into account, we need not wonder that in some tribes in New Zealand the leaven of suspicion, stimulated at times by the ingredient of bad advice, began to work, and that an idea spread that natives would shortly be outlawed and disinherited, and would become slaves to foreigners. Nor were these signs of the times unnoted or unappreciated by thoughtful colo nists. Except for a fatal series of circumstances, there were statesmen in New Zealand who could have success fully encountered, and would, if not altogether peacefully, at all events with the minimum of disturbance, have over come the native difficulty. Fate determined otherwise. I proceed to give a short account of the progress of that difficulty and of its culmination in the war which began in 1860. Generally speaking, the native difficulty was little understood by the colonial community. Many persons lived in the South Island, where there was no native question of importance ; and they had no knowledge of,"], [136, "118 NATIVE DIFFICULTY MISUNDERSTOOD. or interest in, the subject. Others who lived in the North Island, and who ought to have known better, thought that the natives should be left alone, except that the Crown should buy from them as much land as possible for purposes of settlement. An influential class in the province of Auckland agitated for unrestricted trade with natives, both in the purchase of their land, and in the sale to them of arms and ammunition. At Taranaki there was a strong feeling for what was called a firm native policy, which would practically have amounted to coercion. There were others, but they were few, who had strong prejudices in favour of the natives, and who were inclined to extreme courses in that direction. And there was, as I said before, a sprinkling of moderate and far-seeing men, who strongly felt that the native ques- tion was one which should neither be ignored nor \" put down,\" but be sensibly treated on principles of prudence and justice, with indulgent consideration for exceptional circumstances, not in a shifty and evasive way, but on a settled system under which the natives would gradually become, in the fullest sense of the terms, fellow-citizens and fellow-workers with European settlers in the colonisa- tion of New Zealand. These several opinions were, more or less, represented in the Colonial Legislature. As a whole, it may be said that the popular view of the native question was unformed and unshaped ; and there was a time, from 1854 to 1858, when a wise and strong Ministi-y, backed up by a wise and strong Governor, could have done much, if not all, towards the peaceful solution of the problem. The opportunity was lost ; but, in order to avoid mis- apprehension of my meaning, I may at once say that I never knew, throughout the whole political history of New Zealand, any oppressive or unjust policy intentionally adopted towards the natives. Mistakes have been many, and their effects on both races have been grievous ; but the charge that sinister motives have actuated the native policy of any Government or of any Legislature in New Zealand is unfounded and calumnious. The beginning of representative institutions in New Zealand was anomalous and disturbed. For a whole year the Superintendents and the Provincial Councils were in feverish activity, while the Colonial Legislature was"], [137, "119 GOVERNOR GORE BROWNE. forcibly kept in abeyance.* When that Legislature at last was assembled, the question of responsible govern ment was forthwith mooted ; and mismanagement on the part of Colonel Wynyard, the temporary administrator of government, and of leading men in the House of Representatives, caused the collapse of general government for two years. In 1856, the Legislature, comprising a newly elected House of Representatives, was summoned to meet by the new Governor, Colonel Thomas Gore Browne, under more favourable auspices. The members elected were mostly men of intelligence and education, and not a few of them were endowed with high qualities of statesmanship. The Home Government had agreed to the immediate establishment of the responsible system in public administration. The Governor was an excellent man, a thorough English gentleman, and possessed of considerable abilities. He became afterwards Sir Thomas Gore Browne, K.C.M.G. ; and he has, to the great sorrow of his numerous friends, lately died. I shall call him, as he is best known, by his titular appellation. The proper mode of dealing with the native question occupied the anxious attention of Sir Thomas Gore Browne. He came to the conclusion \u2014 a conclusion shared in by many public men in the colony, and approved by the Home Government \u2014 that the administration of native affairs should be kept in the hands of the Governor, independently, though not exclusively, of the advice of his responsible Ministers ; the yearly sum reserved for native purposes by the Constitution Act, and any sum appropriated from time to time by the Colonial Legislature unconditionally for those purposes, to be expended by the Governor. This arrangement, although at the time it appeared to many to be reasonable, and to be justified by the special circum stances of the native race, soon became a fertile source of embarrassment and confusion. Experience soon proved that it was impracticable, in the existing relations of the two races with each other, to divide arbitrarily by a distinct line native affairs from European affairs. A mistake in native administration might at any time occasion serious disaster to colonists ; and, in that case, notwithstanding any nominal arrangement, the Ministry would be called to account by the House of Representatives,"], [138, "120 NATIVE ADMINISTRATION. because, in an important issue, the Ministry should have resigned when its advice was disregarded. Moreover, when complications of this kind occurred, it would be impossible to separate the two administrations. The Governor, also, never could command sufficient funds. The House of Representatives had the power of the purse, and took care, in granting to the Governor powers and money on native subjects, to couple the grants with the condition of his acting in the exercise of those powers, or in the expenditure of that money, with the advice and consent of his Executive Council, or, in other words, of his responsible Ministers. The twofold system of administration was bound to fail ; it was an incongruous imperium in imperio. The Governor and his Ministers, however, never looked upon this exceptional arrangement as a solution of the native difficulty. Both were conscious of the fact that the Constitution Act had in effect placed the natives in a wrong position in the new system of government, and were anxious to devise means for investing them with suitable local self-governing powers, with a view to their further advance in civilisation, and in fitness for full participation in constitutional rights. It is only just to say that both the Governor and his Ministry worked at first heartily together in the preparation of a system of native government framed for that purpose ; and in 1858 two enabling Acts, the Native Districts Regulation Act and the Native Circuits Court Act, were passed with a view to the adoption of native local self-government in native districts. A third Act, the Native Territorial Rights Act, simplifying the native territorial title, was passed by both Houses, and reserved by the Governor for the signification of her Majesty's pleasure thereon. Owing, however, to objections entertained by the Governor to parts of it, her Majesty was not advised to assent to that measure. An attempt, between 1856 and 1858, to give practical effect, so far as could be done in the absence of legislation, to a system of native local self-government had fallen through in consequence of departmental jealousies ; and the effect of that collapse had been very prejudicial to the probable success of the two Acts on the subject, which, as I have said, were passed in 1858. The example set by some native tribes in Taranaki, in 1854, of forming a"], [139, "121 NATIVE KING AND LAND MOVEMENTS. league against selling any more land, was followed else where ; and in 1857 the great Waikato chief, Te Whero Whero \u2014 or, as he was generally called, Potatau \u2014 was nominally elected by a large meeting of natives on the banks of the river Waikato, to be the Maori king. These movements sprang respectively from an earnest desire felt throughout many native districts to do something to prevent the f utnre diminution of their territorial property, and from an anxiety for the consolidation and self-govern ment of their race. At first, it would not have been very difficult for the Government to control these movements and to guide them in a right direction. But delay, and, especially, the collapse of efforts to do so, aggravated the difficulty. And, unfortunately, the war at Waitara, which began in 1860, put an end to all possibility of work in that direction. Before I proceed to the subject of that war, I must notice two serious errors which were made by the Governor, with the sanction of his Ministers, in native administration. The first was the union of the Native Secretary's Depart ment with that of Land Purchase. The impression con veyed to the native mind by that conjunction was that the sole object of native administration was the acquisi tion of native land. This unfavourable impression was aggravated by the knowledge that disputed titles to native land bought by the Governor, on behalf of the Crown, were decided without appeal by the Governor himself. The second error was the relaxation of the order prohibiting the sale of arms and ammunition to natives. This relaxa tion was most ill-timed at a period when native disaffection was increasing, and when it was more than ever advisable to lessen as much as possible the native acquisition of arms. The condition of affairs at Taranaki had been bad from the beginning, and was becoming worse. The land question was the root of the evil which overspread the district. The disallowance by Governor Fitz-Roy of Mr. Commissioner Spain's award had paralyzed the progress of settlement. The return of natives in great number, who had been driven away in native wars before the settlers came, complicated the land disputes between settlers and natives, and between the natives themselves. Natives would, as a rule, not sell land to the Crown, and"], [140, "122 WAITARA LAND QUESTION. their own quarrels about land led them to kill each other. After Sir George Grey had gone, soldiers were sent in 1854, for the first time since the foundation of the colony, to New Plymouth, the capital town of the province of Taranaki. These soldiers were sent for the protection of the settlers, but were not allowed to interfere with natives engaged in fighting among themselves. That prohibition, under the circumstances, was extremely ill judged, and tended to make the natives there feel that our object was that they should kill each other, and that the settlers should divide the spoil. Ill feeling in Taranaki between both races, and within the native race itself, was bitter and violent. At this critical juncture, a small piece of land at Waitara, about twelve miles from New Plymouth, was offered for sale to the Crown by those who claimed to be its owners. The Governor, Sir Thomas Gore Browne, after inquiry was satisfied as to the ownership of the land, and was willing to give the price asked. He gave due notice of his intention to buy, and he allowed time for objection to be made against the sale. An influential native chief, William King, residing at Waitara, disclaimed ownership, but asserted his right, as a chief, to forbid the sale of the land. High authorities in native tenure of land have elaborately argued the question whether William King had this right of veto over this particular piece of land, according to native custom ; and it is still in many minds an unsettled point. At all events, it was a case of native dispute on a most intricate subject ; and it did not seem just that the Governor, who bought the land, should decide the question, and then enforce his decision by force of arms. But, unhappily, he took that course ; and he took it with the approval of his Ministers. Sir Edward Stafford, who was Premier at the time, was in England when the Government became substantially committed to the Course in question, but inasmuch as he did not resign his office when he returned he was constitutionally respon sible ; and, in justice to himself, I must say that he never, so far as I know, tried to evade that responsibility. At the same time, I am strongly of opinion that had he been in New Zealand throughout the whole proceedings he would have avoided resort to force. Sir Donald M'Lean, the Native Under-Secretary and Chief Commissioner of Land Pur-"], [141, "123 WAITARA WAR. chases, was ill at the time, and could not give his advice ; and although he afterwards gave his opinion, when war had begun, that the purchase of the land was just, I am almost sure that he would never have advised the Governor, as a matter of expediency, to have gone to war on account of the purchase. And it is on the ground of expediency that the course taken by Governor Gore Browne, who was, equally with his Ministers, responsible for the war, and who never for a moment shirked that responsibility, is the most open to grave objection. The time, the place, the question, were all inopportune ; and the probable issue was tremendous. One regiment, out of the only two stationed in the colony, had just been withdrawn, and no local forces had been organised. There was also in the colony a scarcity of arms and ammunition for colonial use. The place, difficult of access by sea or by land, was ill chosen for offensive operations. The question at issue was sure to enlist on the side of the chief, William King-, the sympathy and support of the Waikato and other tribes, to whose attacks all the settlers in the North Island would be dangerously exposed. It was also a question which, conversely, would fail in bringing to the side of the Governor active sympathy and support from any large portion of the native race. Loyal tribes, which on almost any other question would have given him material aid, became on a question of forcible land purchase neutral, but there is no doubt that even among them many hearts beat in unison with the cause of William King. The issue was whether civil war should take the place of colonisation. A long and spreading war would probably ensue ; the progress of settlement would be stopped ; and the lives and property of settlers, especially those living in the country, would be subjected to fearful dangers. The cost to the colony in direct expenditure of money, apart from indirect loss, would be enormous. Although the question was popularly termed in the colony one of imperial interest, it was unreasonable to anticipate that England would bear the whole cost and burden of the war, and to be blind to the moral certainty that, in any attempt thus to shift off colonial responsibility, the colony would be exposed to the obvious, although unjust, charge of embarking in a war from greed of native land, and for"], [142, "124 COLONIAL AND PROVINCIAL SYSTEMS. relying on the English tax-payer as the means of enabling it to attain its selfish object. The colonial policy, apart from the native question, was beset with difficulties. These difficulties mainly arose from the course which, in 1853, had been taken by Sir George Grey in setting first into motion the Provincial Superintendents and Councils, and in clothing them, of his own will and by his executive action, with large administrative and legislative functions. These local authorities, thus exceptionally favoured, also obtained, owing- to the delay in summoning the general Legislature and to the subsequent collapse of responsible government for two years longer, a start of three years ; and they made most of the time by absorbing into their own hands as much power as possible. And they also looked forward to the future. The formation of colonial responsible government, as they foresaw, must soon take place, and the provincial battle must be fought in the House of Representatives. The provincial party, therefore, strained every nerve to eleet to that House representatives favour able to provincial views. The great question at issue was whether the colony was to control, or be controlled by, the provinces ; in fact, whether New Zealand should be divided into six or seven independent provinces, and, in other words, whether the Colonial Legislature should be the rudder or the figure-head of the State ship. As it was, when responsible government was established in 1856, the provinces were for all practical purposes con ducting colonisation; and it would have been unwise, if not impracticable, to have suddenly taken its conduct out of their hands. But here arose a special difficulty. The disposal of Crown lands and the appropriation of the Land Fund are essential to proper colonisation, and those two powers were reserved by the Constitution Act to the Colonial Legislature. Again, this difficulty was aggra vated by the fact that in the two islands the territorial question was, in each, fundamentally distinct. In the South Island, the whole waste lands were, with incon siderable exceptions, in the possession of the Crown; in the North Island, the great bulk of the waste lands was in the possession of the natives, from whom what was wanted for settlement must be bought ; and its"], [143, "125 COLONIAL AND PROVINCIAL SYSTEMS. purchase was a tedious, difficult, costly process, and one often involving serious complication.. The localisation of the management of Crown lands and of the appro priation of the Land Fund was fraught with political and financial embarrassment ; and yet it was puzzling to see how otherwise colonisation could be locally carried on with success ; for, as I have said, it would have been unwise, if not impracticable, in the existing* circumstances of the colony, to deprive the provinces of the conduct of colonisation. The Stafford Ministry of 1856, on whom the solution of this problem devolved, was not opposed to local self-government ; but it did not wish, under the guise of that name, to tear general government to tatters. All that it did, and, in my view, could do without sacrifice of its duty to the colony, was to compromise, and use the means at its command to the best of its power, in face of great opposition, and in difficult questions where the better course was often very doubtful. The consequence was a course of policy which had an important, and, at its best, a questionable, effect on the colonisation of New Zealand. Emigration, settlement on land, and public works were, in addition to more proper local business, left to the control and management of Superintendents and Provincial Councils. Regulations for the disposal of Crown lands were practically allowed to he framed by them, although the formal enactment was made by the Colonial Legislature ; and the Land Fund was allocated, after the defrayal of the cost of its collection, to the province in which it arose. A certain proportion of the customs revenue raised in each province was assured to it also. Loans were raised for the purchase of native land in the North Island ; and the New Zealand Company's debt, or rather the loan for its defrayal, was charged exclusively on the proceeds of Crown lands in the southern settlements. The abso lute localisation of the Land Fund was by far the most important of these measures ; and there is no doubt in my mind that, in the general interests of New Zealand, it was impolitic and unwise. The so-called equivalent given to the provinces in the North Island in the shape of loans for the purchase of native land was a delusion ; the money went a very little way ; and the provinces in the South Island, except the province of Nelson, whose available"], [144, "126 LOCALISATION OF LAND FUND \u2014 FINANCE. territory had been already monopolised by a few land holders under Sir George Grey's land regulations of 1853, were for years rolling in territorial wealth, while the provinces in the North Island were in continuous starvation. The native war of course aggravated this anomaly ; but, apart from it, the policy of localising the proceeds of Crown lands was unjust to the North Island. Moreover, that policy was on general political grounds objectionable. Although qualified and conditional locali sation of land revenue was a wise and just principle of policy, absolute localisation created prejudicial antago nism between provinces, disordered all finance, unsettled systematic colonisation for many years, and, finally, ended in the downfall of the whole provincial system. Another financial complication arose from allowing provinces to borrow money on the security of their revenues. Large sums were thus borrowed under special Provincial Loan Acts, on the condition that the colony was not liable for these debts. The rates of interest paid were two or three per cent, higher than the colony could have obtained the money for, and the money raised was spent without any colonial control over the expenditure. This colonial exemption was only for a time, as in 1 867 the colony assumed the whole liability, taking the provincial bonds, which were at considerable discount in comparison with colonial bonds, at par. I think that, under the circum stances, the colony did right to undertake this liability on those terms ; but I give the case as one of many instances in which, owing to the irregular and imprudent mode of giving effect to provincial institutions, wrong was done to the colony. In drawing attention to the colonial policy between 1856 and 1860, and to the excessive and uncontrolled action of the provincial executive and legislative au thorities from their creation in 1853 to 1860, I do not wish to be understood to imply that it would have been better to have had centralised administration and legis lation alone, or even to a large extent. Far from enter taining that view, I strongly hold that local institutions, such as were given by the Constitution Act, were essential to the satisfactory progress of New Zealand. All that I contend for is that they should have been first set in"], [145, "127 CONDITION OF COLONY, 1859. motion under the direction and control of the Colonial Legislature, and, in that way, they would have had a better prospect of working in harmony with the rest of the con stitutional machinery and with more successful effect. As it was, that machinery was thrown out of gear. But, at the same time, I am bound to admit that those provincial institutions, even under all the disadvantages referred to, did much good colonising work. There is so great a vitality inherent in local self-government that, in spite of all obstacles, it cannot but do much good. This admission can be made quite consistently with the argument that, under better conditions, the provincial system would have done more good, and would have lasted longer. Before I proceed to notice the war which began in 1860, and which may be said to have continued for ten years, I take the year 1859 as another standpoint for a short survey of the progressive condition both of the natives and of the colonists. The natives were fast acquiring the knowledge and practice of civilisation. All the Scriptures were translated, and, as well as several other books, were printed in the Maori language. Out of an estimated total of 56,000, there were 35,000 natives professing Christianity. The half-castes numbered nearly 2000. A large proportion of natives could read and write in their own language, and a larger proportion of the rising generation was learning the English language. Many natives owned cattle, ploughs, and mills ; wheat cultivation was extensive ; and there was a brisk trade with English settlements. A general desire prevailed to have settlers near native villages. Cannibalism had been extinct since 1843, and slavery had been abolished soon afterwards. English courts were regarded with respect, and there was a wide-spread feeling in favour of English laws. Better houses were in many places built ; blankets and imperfect European dress were common ; and tea and sugar were in common use. Tobacco-smoking was uni versal ; spirits were only occasionally drunk, and almost exclusively in the neighbourhood of towns. Movable property and, in some cases, land were individualised. Small native vessels were more and more employed on the coast. Trade, ships, land, flour, ploughs, horses, cattle, wheat, and laws were the general subjects of conversation."], [146, "128 CONDITION OF COLONY, 1859. And even in English sports the natives were learning to take a practical interest : they took part in regattas ; and, at one of the yearly races in Auckland, the maiden plate of \u00a3150 was won by \"New Zealander,\" the horse of Patuone, a native chief. The progress of the colonists from 1853 to 1859 was very remarkable. The year 1855 had begun with another violent earthquake in Cook Strait, and Wellington had again suffered most from its destructive effects. Fortunately only one life was lost ; but property to the value of \u00a316,000 was destroyed. The panic, however, caused by this convulsion of nature soon subsided, and the settlers went to work again with un flinching energy. As some compensation for the disaster, it was found that the earthquake had elevated the town of Wellington and the surrounding country two feet, and had changed low-water mark into high-water mark. The European population in 1859 was 71,593 in number. The European settlements in the North Island were the provinces of Auckland, Taranaki, and Wellington ; and, in the South Island, the provinces of Nelson, Canterbury, and Otago. The population was nearly equal in each island. The provinces of Auckland and Wellington were the most populous, but Canterbury and Otago were advancing with rapid steps in the race of colonisation. Nelson had half a million sheep, twice as many as in Canterbury and Otago, and a third more than in the province of Wellington. Auckland was not a grazing district, but its area of cultivated land was at that time the greatest. The total value of the produce of New Zealand exported during 1859 was a little more than half a million sterling. Although then the great discoveries of gold in Otago, on the west coast of Canterbury, and in the Thames district had not been made, gold had been found in some places, and the value of \u00a328,427 represents, in 1859, its export. Steam communication had been established between the different settlements, and good roads were penetrating the country in all directions. Colonisation had taken firm root, and was fast over spreading the land. Although at that time the relations of large sections of the native race with the Government were unsatisfactory, there was no general hostility of native feeling to Europeans, and travellers went in safety"], [147, "129 CONDITION OF COLONY, 1859. through remote native districts. Native difficulties, no doubt, were a great hindrance to the progress of settle ment in the North Island, but, as was soon unhappily proved, impatience and force wrere the worst means of removing those difficulties."], [148, "130 WAITARA WAR.

The Waitara question was at first a little cloud of which few saw the significance till the whole horizon became black, and the tempest came. A few acres of land were in dispute ; and when the survey by the Crown began, the surveyors were opposed by some old native women. The crisis, however, soon came ; and the fatal seed then sown grew quickly into a crop of armed men, and ripened into a harvest of bloodshed. It is strange to see, in the retrospect of history, and even of a short human life, what small causes produce enormous effects. And, perhaps, in few instances is this more often seen in the record of nations than in wars. One probable cause is that fighting forthwith begets another strong element of strife, namely, personal rivalry between the combatants. In a common fight, even between two schoolboys, this passionate feeling is roused ; and we may imagine its effect when, in international wars, the motive is infinitely multiplied, and the contest is carried on in sight of the whole civilised world. It is not, therefore, so strange as it would otherwise seem, that in wars the cause of quarrel is soon forgotten or ignored, and that their horrors are protracted till the superiority of the one or the other of the combatants has been proved. In New Zealand, when actual fighting once began between the forces of the Crown and the natives, there were other intensifying circumstances in the contest. In the absence of any"], [149, "131 WAITARA WAR. decisive defeat of the natives, or of signs of their sub- mission, the Crown could not stay its hand, because that course would only incite turbulent natives to more general and more active aggression. A semi-barbarous race would attribute concession to fear. Again, the cause of the war originated in a question of land, underlying, as many natives strongly felt, the freedom and welfare of their race, \u2014 a question on which they were ready to fight to the death. Now, as it happened, far from there being any successes on the side of the Crown, which would justify it in taking the part of forbearance, it suffered several reverses, and made on the whole no way in bringing the opposing natives to terms. On the con- trary, the course of events only stimulated the natives to more active and more extended hostilities. And this course, under the existing conditions, may not unreason- ably have been anticipated. The Government entered into war unprepared, and without first counting the cost. Colonisation and war cannot be simultaneously conducted. \u2022Settlers, especially out-settlers, and their families must be protected while soldiers were fighting the enemy. The only mode of protection was to turn adult male settlers into soldiers, and to bring women and children into garri- sons ; and this course was incompatible with the progress, or even the maintenance, of settlement. Moreover, the great disadvantages under which war could be waged with the natives should have been obvious to any one who knew the country and the natives. The country, excepit a fringe of sea-coast, was very difficult of access; was covered by forest and almost impenetrable under- growth ; and its military occupation must be tedious, enormously expensive, and be accompanied by great loss of life. The natives fought under no such difficulties : they occupied almost inaccessible fastnesses in the interior; they needed no heavy equipment and no elaborate system of commissariat ; they were always in light marching order, could live on fern-root, could easily assemble at any moment without our knowledge, could select their own time and opportunity, and make suddenly marauding and murderous attacks, and retire as suddenly into refuges of safety. They could in a few days build, in strong natural positions, pahs fortified by palisades and pro-"], [150, "132 WAITARA WAR. tected by rifle-pits. The capture of these places could only be effected in many cases by our soldiers with great labour and loss of life; but the natives could at any time evacuate them with no loss, and reappear in another position. Guerilla fighting was the essence of Maori warfare ; and of all kinds of fighting that is the most difficult to cope with, especially under the conditions which governed it in New Zealand. The natives in arms against the Crown used their advantages to the utmost ; and it redounds greatly to the credit of the British forces, soldiers, sailors, regular and colonial, engaged in New Zealand, that they displayed always energy, perseverance, and indomitable pluck under great disadvantages. It is not within the scope and object of this work to give a detailed account of the New Zealand war which began in 1860, and which was more or less continuous for ten years. That account has been given by many competent writers on the subject, and is recorded in public de spatches. I wish rather to notice the more general features of the war in relation to the natives, and to its effect on the colonisation of the country. The spread of the war became more and more per ceptible ; its advance was, as it were, by fits and starts, insidious and irregular, but the fact that there was an advance was incontestable. As natives said, fire had been set to the fern, and no one could tell when it would be put out. The fire, once lit, would burn beyond control ; it would flash, and smoulder, and run invisibly along the ground ; and, when it seemed at the point of extinction, it would suddenly burst into fresh flame at distant and unexpected places. Experience soon showed that it would be impossible to localise the fighting in Taranaki. Tribes from other parts would be gradually drawn into the vortex, and, unfortunately, in opposition to the Crown. At first, young men, even though their tribes held aloof from open alliance with William King, went of their own accord to fight on his side ; the subsequent similar absorp tion of the respective tribes was only a question of short time. This was especially the case with the great Waikato tribes. The wily chief, William King, as soon as fighting began, took instant advantage of the character of the question at issue between the Governor and himself, and"], [151, "WAITARA WAR. 133 made over the disputed piece of land to the native king. This action tended much to nationalise the quarrel, and enlisted the sympathy of a large portion of the native race. Although the powerful tribes in the Central and Upper Waikato districts did not, as a body, take arms against the Crown, many of their young men, as I have said, joined William King ; and the general attitude of those tribes was menacing, and caused great anxiety for the safety of the almost defenceless settlement of Auckland. And there was at first much cause for that anxiety. At any moment, while almost all the troops, transferred from Auckland, were at New Plymouth, and before any local forces could be organised, a sudden incui-sion of Waikato natives, en masse, against Auckland might easily have taken place ; and, even if the whole settlement had not been devastated, it is certain that a most terrible scene of destruction 'of life and property would have been the consequence. And the occurrence of such a catastrophe would not have been surprising. A community of un armed men and of women and children, wholly engaged in peaceful pursuits, resided iu the town, and was scat tered around it, within a circumference described by a radius, say, of thirty miles. The town was denuded of troops ; the militia and volunteers were forces scarcely formed and wholly undisciplined, and for some time it was impossible to furnish them properly with arms and ammunition. The pensioners, stationed at four vil lages on the outskirts of the isthmus on which Auckland stands, were the only available force, and they were inadequate to the emergency which might easily have arisen, for Auckland was open to attack by sea as well as by land. A fleet of canoes from the Thames could have by night landed men in the city before their ap proach was known ; and it was quite, at the time, a practical probability that the Thames tribes, as well as those at Waikato, would assist William King by an attack on Auckland. Fortunately the wise counsels of leading chiefs, and the good advice of missionaries and other Europeans in whom the natives still felt great trust, prevailed at the most critical moment. Added to that influence, there was, no doubt, a strong feeling, among many tribes living in the neighbourhood of Auckland, of"], [152, "134 WAITARA WAR. friendship with, and of confidence in, the general body of settlers ; a feeling that had grown, and had been strength- ened, year by year, by intercourse and by common in- terest in trade and social pursuits. The progress of the war in Taranaki was unsatisfactory in a military point of view, and, in the interests of colonisation, was posi- tively disastrous. The troops, consisting of regular forces and of local militia and volunteers, were marched to and fro in expeditions against nomadic bands of hostile natives and against native pahs in strong positions, with varying results, but, on the whole, with a preponderance of failure. At all events, although the number of troops engaged was always increasing, there was no decisive or beneficial result. On the contrary, the number of natives in arms against the Crown was also on the increase, and their attitude became more and more aggressive. The whole settlement was changed into a military camp ; women and children were huddled together in the town, and the male adults were engaged in active service as militia- men and volunteers. I have already stated that all the forces, naval and military, deserve great credit for their conduct, but I take this opportunity of saying specially with respect to settlers who were suddenly called to active service, that, altogether unaccustomed as they were to arms and to the exigencies of actual warfare, they showed, under very trying circumstances, conspicuous courage, energy, and endurance in the camp and in the field. Not only were they required to undertake duties wholly alien to their former habits of life, but they were forced to leave their homes, and, in many cases, abandon their farms, gardens, and cultivations to plunder and destruction by the enemy. In the early part of 1861 a faint and sickly gleam of peace was seen, but only for a short time. An armed truce was arranged in Taranaki ; and even then, at the eleventh hour, it was hoped that wise counsels would prevail, and permanent peace be established on honourable terms. But the hope was vain. At that time, an influential chief, Wi Tami hana \u2014 or Te Waharoa, as he was called by the natives \u25a0 \u2014 laboured earnestly in the cause of peace ; and it was mainly owing to his influence that the Taranaki natives in arms against us agreed to the terms of 1861, which"], [153, "135 WAITARA WAR. only amounted to a suspension of hostilities, allowing time for negotiation. That renowned chief had been a great warrior in his youth, but in the early days of colonisation he had been converted to Christianity, and had become a zealous labourer in the moral and political regeneration of the native race. He was endowed with great abilities ; he was far-seeing, reflective, and thoughtful; his influence with the natives was weighty and well earned. Wi Tamihana had first conceived the idea of a native king, and in 1857, at a numerous assembly of natives belonging chiefly to Waikato tribes, he caused Potatau to be set up as native king. The object of Wi Tamihana was, in his own words, \" to seek some plan by which the Maori tribes should become united, that they should assemble together, and the people become one like the Pakehas \" (foreigners). The pilan -was mistaken, but, under all the circumstances, was natural, and, coming from a native, it was certainly patriotic. Moral blindness on the part of the Government frustrated this movement, and made what might at one time have been directed towards good and great purposes the cause of extensive and irremedi able evil. But it is not just to blame the Government alone. There was a large party in the colony, comprising the majority of colonists, who strongly supported the native policy of that Government as one which would, after a short, sharp, and decisive struggle, put down for ever all native difficulties. The motto of that party was, \" Conquest of peace.\" Bitter experience, after many years, reduced that party to insignificant proportions ; but even to the end voices were heard still persisting in that misleading cry, and attributing all past misery and failure to mismanagement, to political difficulties, and to everything but what was mainly the true cause. More over, in addition to local support, the Home Government, in 1860, approved the course taken by Governor Gore Browne in respect of the Waitara land purchase, and liberally g-ave material aid in the war which ensued. I am not blaming that Government for what it then did, inasmuch as hostilities in Taranaki had begun before its decision could be given. I shall hereafter refer to its subsequent action ; at present, I am only adducing the fact of its approval in order to show that, at home as well"], [154, "136 SIR GEORGE GREY AGAIN GOVERNOR. as in the colony, the native policy of the New Zealand Government was strongly supported. To this twofold support it was probably owing that, in 1861, Governor Gore Browne determined to put down by force of arms, if necessary, the king movement, and issued a manifesto declaring that intention. That step was deliberately taken in view of a general native war in consequence ; and it is almost certain that a war of races would have taken place, had it not been that at that time Sir Thomas Gore Browne, whose term of office had expired, was replaced by Sir George Grey, who, as a former Governor of New Zealand, had rendered signal service, and that also the Stafford Ministry resigned on a general want of confidence motion carried by a majority of one in the House of Representatives. This adverse motion was not owing to native policy, but to Ministerial action in other colonial affairs. Unfortunately these political changes came too late to do all the good which many anticipated. Distrust had been sown broadcast in the mind of a large portion of the native race, and had taken too deep root to be at once removed ; and, although a general native rising was arrested by the withdrawal of Governor Gore Browne's king manifesto, the Taranaki truce came to a bad end, and the war, like some incurable and malignant growth, took firmer hold of the system, and outspread itself more and more. Sir George Grey, and the new Ministry of which Mr. William Fox (now Sir William Fox) was Premier, worked hard to regain native confidence and to restore peace. Both of them believed that the beginning of the war was wrong on the part of the Government ; but it is often impossible at once to repair a wrong ; and the immediate laying down of arms by the Crown would, in the excited state of native feeling at the time, have been taken as an invitation to further native aggression, and would have rather extended than have put an end to native hostilities. Moreover, tribes and many individual natives had joined William King without any justification on their part. There is no doubt that many social and political problems in this world place us in the painful dilemma of sub ordinating what is theoretically right to practical expe diency ; and civil war is eminently an instance of that"], [155, "137 NEW NATIVE POLICY. fact. We are thus forced to pay an additional penalty of error. All, however, that Sir George Grey could well do was done by him in 1862. He gave up to the Ministry, subject to the approval of the Home Government, the ordinary control of native affairs as in other public affairs under the system of responsible government. His own exceptional position, however, and the imperial interests involved in the native war practically reserved to him the initiation and conduct of the native policy. His native policy may be shortly summed up as follows : \u2014 1. The establishment of tranquillity so as best to secure its permanence. 2. The grant of local self-government specially adapted to the wants and circumstances of the natives. 3. Connection of Auckland with Waikato by a good coach road. 4. Withdrawal from all attempt to suppress by force of arms the native king movement ; but, at the same time, while avoiding its official recognition, to endeavour to exhaust its vitality by substituting for it measures accept able to the natives generally, framed in their special in terests, and based on the principle of securing for them self-government, not apart from, but in common with, the colonists. In order to effect these objects Sir George Grey strove ably, earnestly, and, at first, with some prospect of success. His failure was mainly attributable to the native king movement. The course taken by his predecessor in be ginning the war at Waitara, and in afterwards issuing a hostile manifesto against the king movement, had given to that movement an exaggerated importance in the eyes of its native adherents. They looked upon it as the charter of their lands and their freedom, and they insisted on its official recognition as an essential condition of peace. That official recognition it was impossible to give. Although left to itself it need not have been made a cause of war, its official sanction would have been antagonistic to the sovereignty of the Queen, or, at all events, detrimental to the good government of the natives and to the peaceful amalgamation of the two races ; it would also have been unjust and offensive to a very large number, if not an actual majority, of natives who had, chiefly from loyalty"], [156, "138 NEW NATIVE POLICY. to the Crown and partly from other motives, persistently refused to join in the native king movement. Sir George Grey could not therefore on his part assure the king natives of his official recognition of their king ; and they, on their part, would not, after all that had taken place, be satisfied with anything short of that concession. Accord ingly, they refused to accept his proposed native local insti tutions, and they persisted in their hostile attitude. This attitude was, in the case of a large body of natives, a state of smouldering disaffection which might at any moment burst into a flame of active hostility. The loyal natives at the Bay of Islands and at other places were quite willing to accept the new institutions, but the determination of the king natives to refuse them, and the ground on which that determination was founded, almost precluded hope of last ing peace in Taranaki, for encouragement was thus given to the natives in arms there against the Crown to continue to fight ; and also the two questions of native land and native government were thus so bound up together as to make the war, in the view of a large and increasing number of natives, a war of national independence. Other adverse influences, although subsidiary to the main cause of failure, were at work. The formation of the road to Waikato was a legitimate, politic, and necessary course of action, but it roused suspicion in the Waikato tribes of ulterior measures of hostility against them. Again, the session of the New Zealand Parliament in 1862 did not tend to reassure the native mind. A large and influential party in the House of Representatives was still in favour of the native policy of Sir Thomas Gore Browne and of the Stafford Ministry, and it took the first opportunity of opposing the Fox Ministry on an important native question. That question arose when Sir William Fox proposed reso lutions confirming the virtual transfer of responsibility in native affairs to Ministers. These resolutions were nega tived by the casting vote of the Speaker, and Sir William Fox resigned. At the same time the Secretary of State's despatch, sanctioning the transfer which had been made by Sir George Grey, arrived ; and both Houses passed addresses to Her Majesty, declining in effect to undertake the responsibility of native affairs, and endeavouring to place the whole responsibility for the war at Waitara on"], [157, "139 WAITARA PURCHASE ABANDONED. the Home Government. This action of the two Houses did not change the decision of the Home Government, but it worked much mischief, for it enfeebled future native ad ministration and was the cause of disastrous complications. And further, soon after the close of the session an execu tive act, owing to an unfortunate blunder, had the reverse of its intended effect. The Governor determined to aban don the Waitara purchase, and to take military possession of Tataraimaka, a small block of land about fifteen miles to the south of New Plymouth, which belonged to Euro peans, but had, at the beginning of the war, been seized and occupied by natives who sympathized with William King. Prudence and good policy pointed to the advisa bility of making the adoption of the two measures simul taneous, or, at least, the resumption of Tataraimaka sub sequent to the abandonment of Waitara. Unfortunately, the military occupation of Tataraimaka took place first, and before it was known by the natives that Waitara was given up. The consequence was that a native ambus cade murdered two officers, a non-commissioned officer, and five privates. This sad event put an end to the existing truce, and made further fighting inevitable. The war soon afterwards assumed much larger proportions. The disaffected state of feeling in the Waikato tribes made their insurrection imminent, and placed the Auckland settlements in a perilous position. Sir George Grey first, as a means of precaution, required the natives residing in villages interspersed with these settlements to take the oath of allegiance, or to remove themselves outside the European boundaries. The natives refused to take the oath of allegiance, retired into the adjoining forest, and murdered and plundered neighbouring settlers. The Governor then determined to attack in force the main body of the enemy, and war was carried into the Waikato. The relations between the Governor and the Ministry, weakened and confused as they were by the action of the two Houses in the session of 1862, had already shown sinister symp toms. Delay, discussion, controversy in its worst shape that is to say, in writing \u2014 and conflict had arisen where promptitude and union were essential to success. But at all events it cannot be truly said that the colony did not, in proportion to its resources, make every effort to provide"], [158, "140 WAR RESUMED AND EXTENDED. men and material in aid of the imperial forces. I say this because the colony was most unjustly censured at the time by the Secretary of State for alleged failure in this re spect. The truth is that the colony was then providing, at its own charge, not only its militia and volunteers, but also five regiments raised in Victoria and elsewhere, and had placed these local forces under the general in com mand. The system was mainly in fault for the evils which occurred ; and although the colony was at first partly re sponsible for that faulty system, the Home Government was afterwards much more responsible. But I reserve what I wish to say on this point till I come to the subject of the political difficulties which ensued. Soon after war in Waikato had begun, the whole central interior of the northern island became involved in war. And then gradu ally, in spite of the general success which attended the forces of the Crown in the Waikato campaign, the war laterally spread to the east and west coasts. The South Island was altogether exempt from fighting, but the only parts of the North Island exempt were to the north of the Auckland isthmus, and to the south of the degree of lati tude running across the island from the west coast about ten miles to the north of the town of Wanganui. The war practically lasted from 1860 to 1870. The number of regular troops in New Zealand increased, between June, 1863, and August, 1865, from 5245 to 10,047 men. In addition, a considerable naval force was employed. The militia, volunteers, and other local forces raised by the colony amounted to about 10,000 additional men. The loss of life during the whole war was great. On our side the number killed may be estimated at least at 500 men ; and the Maoris probably lost three times that number. The proportion of men wounded on both sides was prob ably five times greater than the killed. The loss of pro perty belonging to the colonists was enormous. The direct cost of this war to the colonial treasury was between three and four millions sterling, and the indirect loss to the colony has been incalculable. Some incidents in the war illustrative of features in its character may be interesting to my readera. I substantially take the narrative of these incidents from an excellent work (published in 1873), called \" Bush Fighting : The"], [159, "141 INCIDENTS OF WAR. Maori War,\" written by Major-General Sir James Alexander, who took an active share in part of the campaign. As I have already stated, all ranks of the forces of the Crown, regular and colonial, showed courage and endur ance under very trying circumstances. I take the follow ing instance, among others, of special daring, gallantry, and presence of mind shown by a small detachment of regulars in a critical emergency. In September, 1853, Captain Swift, in command of a small detachment of one officer and fifty men of the 65th Regiment, went through the bush, by a very difficult and circuitous track, in support of some friendly natives who had been attacked. Not finding the enemy, Colour- Sergeant McKenna volunteered to act as scout, and, on receiving his report, Captain Swift ordered his men to fix bayonets and charge into an open space, where they at once engaged with the enemy. Captain Swift fell at once, mortally wounded, but directed Lieutenant Butler, the only other officer, to continue the attack. This officer received a severe wound and was incapacitated. Colour- Sergeant McKenna then assumed the command of the party, and handled it with admirable coolness and skill. The party, lessened by separation from its advanced guard, which had missed the track, only numbered thirty eight, and these were further reduced, owing to some of them being bearers of the wounded, to about thirty fighting men. These few men, after both their officers had been struck down, held their own in the presence of two hundred of the enemy. About six o'clock in the evening the enemy had worked round to the rear of the party and thus cut off its retreat. The sergeant determined to move down \"the hill, which was covered with fern, and, sending on the wounded, he threw out a line of skirmishers, with the order, \" Fire and retire.\" In this way they retreated down the hill in a steady, orderly manner, in face of a continuous fire, till it be came so dark that they lost the track. The sergeant and his men stopped where they were until morning, not a word being spoken nor even a pipe lighted. Early next morning the sergeant extricated his men from the bush, and, being met by a reinforcement which had been sent to their help, gained the camp completely exhausted. The"], [160, "142 COLONIAL FORCES. men in charge of Captain Swift and of the wounded did their duty nobly, and carried them safely into camp. The casualties on our side were one officer, Captain Swift, and three men killed, and one officer, Lieutenant Butler, and four men wounded. Serg-eant McKenna received a com mission and the Victoria Cross for his conduct in this affair. Sir James Alexander writes in terms of high praise about the conduct of the colonial forces. In the early part of the Taranaki campaign, Captain Atkinson, now (1888) Sir Harry A. Atkinson, K.C.M.G., and Premier of New Zealand, but then senior officer in command of the Taranaki Volunteers, showed indomitable energy and great skill in the performance of difficult duties. He and his men ably co-operated with the regular forces, and cheer fully endured fatigue and privation. Sir James Alexander also refers in terms of praise to Captain Heaphy, of the Auckland Volunteers, and to Captain Jackson, and Captain Von Tempsky, of the Forest Rangers. Captain Heaphy, in gallantly assisting a soldier of the 40th Regiment who had fallen in action, wounded, into a hollow, became a target for a volley from the Maoris at short range. Captain Heaphy was wounded in three places, and his clothes were riddled with balls. He was recommended for the Victoria Cross, having continued the whole day in aiding the wounded, and he received that deserved distinction. Colonel Nixon, commanding the Colonial Defence Force, is also honourably mentioned as \" a most able and gallant officer.\" He received at Rangiawhia a fatal wound in the chest. In his despatch, General Cameron wrote that \" the Colonial Defence Force, under the command of Colonel Nixon, attained a high state of discipline and efficiency, and they displayed the greatest spirit and gallantry on this occasion.\" In 1864, the Legislative Council and the House of Representatives thanked General Cameron and the imperial and colonial forces for the discipline and valour they had displayed in the late operations in which they had been engaged. From 1866 to 1870, the year when at last permanent peace was restored, the whole burden of the conduct of the war devolved on the colony. Sir James, in referring"], [161, "143 NA TIVE FOR TIFICA TIONS. to the bloody conflicts which took place between the colonial forces and the enemy, testifies to the distinguished conduct of Captain Westrupp, 'Lieutenant Biggs, and Ensign Ross at Pukemaire. He also does justice to the gallant conduct of Captain Buck, an officer of his late regiment, and of Major Von Tempsky, who both fell at Ngatiatemanu. He writes of Major Von Tempsky as \" an active officer, a very intelligent man, and very deeply regretted.\" After mentioning the employment of Colonel Whitmore, late Military Secretary to Sir Duncan Cameron, in various military capacities in the colony after the regulars had left, Sir James Alexander gives great credit to \" the ex ploits of her Majesty's colonial forces subsequent to 1866.\" Colonel Whitmore, now General Sir George >S. Whitmore, K.C.M.G., was in command for a long time between 1866 and 1869 of those forces, and rendered valuable services in the field. Sir James also does justice to the skill, courage, and other good qualities often shown by the native enemy. He more than once refers to native skill in the choice of strong- natural positions of defence, and in their fortifica tion, a characteristic feature of which is the rifle-pit \u2014 a defensive work stated by high modern military authority to be the simplest fieldwork, and best suited to the tactics of the present day. At Merimeri, on a high commanding slope looking directly over a reach of the river Waikato, the natives had made a continuous double line of rifle-pits running across the track leading between the river and a great swamp, and then passing through thick bush. Low down and near the water level they had cleared a large space and thrown up an earthwork as a position for two shi]Ds' guns which they had had for years. At Rangi riri, on the same river, the native defence consisted of a line of high parapet and double ditch, the centre of this line being strengthened by a square redoubt of very formidable construction, with a ditch twelve feet wide, eighteen feet deep from the top of the parapet to the bottom of the ditch. The strength of the work was not known before the attack, as its profile could not be seen from the river or the ground in front. Behind the left centre of the main line, and at right angles to it, there"], [162, "144 COURAGE OF NATIVES. was a strong interior line of rifle-pits facing the river and obstructing the advance of the troops from that side ; and about five hundred yards behind the front position there was a high ridge, the summit of which was fortified by rifle-pits. At Te Aire pah in Taranaki, overlooking the Waitara, the works were very formidable ditches, fifteen feet deep, with \u2014 what was a novelty in Maori fortification \u2014 a strong parapet built of earth mixed with fern, similar to the construction adopted by the Engineers in New Zealand, but about sixteen feet thick, covered by a line of rifle-pits, or a covered way about forty yards in front of the line of the stockade, so that had our guns been used, the Maori defenders, being in front instead of in rear of the stockade, would have been entirely under cover. The shot and shell, which would have naturally been thrown into the stockade, would have been quite ineffectual, and the garrison would have been able to have received any attacking column after the palisades had been apparently breached. Instances of Maori courage were frequent during the war. Among many I cite three. On the occasion of the capture of the pah at Orakau, General Cameron, being aware that there were many women and children inside the pah, called on the defenders of the pah to surrender and that their lives would be spared. Their reply was that they would \" fight for ever and ever and ever,\" and when they were told to send away the women, they answered, \" The women will fight as well as we.\" During three days' investment of Orakau, all that its three hundred Maori defenders had to subsist on was a few raw potatoes, without a drop of water, whilst grape, bullets, and grenades poured into the work. At last, in a body, the Maoris made a desperate sortie, and mostly escaped through our lines of troops. General Cameron characterised the action of those natives as one of heroic courage and devotion. Another instance of native daring was when the enemy attacked our troops in broad daylight and penetrated our camp till they were within 150 yards from General Cameron's tent. They were beaten by the steady discipline of British troops and the superiority of British firearms, but the result of the fight raised the Maoris much in the estimation of our soldiers. The escape of"], [163, "OTHER GOOD QUALITIES. 145 fifty Maoris, in January, 1866, from a hulk on which they were confined in the harbour of Wellington, showed great daring and astuteness. On a dark, tempestuous night they managed to open one of the bow ports, and swam three-fourths of a mile to shore, without alarming the guard stationed on board. The war also brought into notice some other remarkable Maori qualities of a high order. There are, of course, many native customs in time of war repugnant to civilised humanity, and therefore it is only right to give praise when praise is due. At Paterangi, the son of the principal chief was badly wounded in the leg, and fell into our hands. Every care was taken of him, but amputation became necessary. He then rapidly re covered, and his father was requested to send for his son ; he did so, and on the next day he sent, with a message of thanks, a cart-load of potatoes as a present to the general, and the chief also declared his intention in future to spare wounded soldiers. Another instance was conspicuous on the occasion of our disastrous attack on the Gate pah at Tauranga. When the British troops took possession of the work on the following morning, Colonel Booth and some men were found still living, and had not been maltreated. On the contrary, when Colonel Booth told a Maori that he wanted water, the Maori took a calabash and went outside the pah to the swamp, at great risk to himself, and fetched water for the colonel. When first the troops came to Tauranga, the chief, Henare Wiremu Taratoa, sent a formal challenge for a fight to Colonel Greer, and also sent to him the following curious document : \u2014 \" To the Colonel. Salutations to you. The end of that. Friend, do you give heed to our laws for regulating the fight. 1. If wounded, or captured whole, and the butt of the musket or hilt of the sword be turned to me, he will be saved. 2. If any Pakeha, being a soldier, shall be travelling unarmed, and meet me. he will be captured, and handed over to the directors of the land. 3. The soldier who flees, being carried away by his fears, and goes to the house of his priest with hiiv gun (even though carrying arms), will be saved; I will not go there. 4. The unarmed Pakehas, women and, children, will be spared. The end. These are binding; L"], [164, "146 WAR DEMORALISED NATIVES. laws for Tauranga\" (signed by five Catholic chiefs). Governor Sir George Grey took occasion, when he was addressing the Tauranga natives who had been in arms, to express his sense of the honourable manner in which they had conducted hostilities, neither robbing nor mur dering, but respecting the wounded. I may also add that the watches and money taken at the Gate pah were all given back by the natives. Adversity had its uses, but. it must not be thought that the war did no harm to the Maoris as a race, for it wrought among them enormous and infinite harm. The material harm may be calculated within certain limits, but the moral harm is incalculable. Maori civilisation and union with colonists were put back, over the greater part of the North Island, for a generation, if not longer. There were many tribes which lived in peace, and which more or less prospered, but it is much to be feared that the disastrous consequences of the war to the native race as a whole are fatal and irretrievable. General demorali sation, extending far beyond the sphere of the actual war, has taken place. European vices are adopted by an in creasing number and with accumulated bad effect. A new creed, called the Pai mariri or Hau hau faith, sprang up during the war ; it was a blasphemous parody of the sacred truths inculcated by the missionaries during forty years with much labour, amid great difficulties, and with signal success! The origin of this religious relapse was evidently attributable to the general wish of the large body of natives opposed to us in the war, to divorce itself spiritually as well as bodily from communion with our race. This was the cause why thousands of natives suddenly embraced a worse than heathen superstition, and why, under the malignant influence, they committed great atrocities ; among others, the hanging of an old Church of England missionaiy, the Rev. Mr. Volkner, at his own mission station at Opotiki. Morally, even more than materially, the war left in the Maori world a large desert of desolation, which it is scarcely possible to revivify. Mechanical restoration may partly be effected, but the natural forces can never be renewed. It may be doubtful whether, under any probable circumstances, it would be possible to save the native race of New Zealand"], [165, "147 RANGIRIRI. from ultimate extinction, when placed in contact with colonisation, hut it is certain that the war has done much to diminish the elements of success in that beneficent work. The war \" dragged its slow length along,\" and its tendency to growth by what it fed on' may be judged of by the fact that, in 1865, General Cameron, who sincerely wished for its early honourable conclusion, was of opinion that, under all circumstances, a reinforcement of 2000 -men would be necessary, and wrote to the Home Govern ment to that effect. In order to show the character of the fighting which took rdace, I extract from Sir James Alexander's book graphic descriptions of a few severe engagements. At Rangiriri, on the Lower Waikato, the native enemy occupied a strong position which it was necessary for General Cameron to take ; and, with that object, a com bined attack by troops on land and from steamers on the river was made in November, 1863. Sir James writes : \" After shelling the enemy's works for an hour and a half, the day being well advanced, and there being little pros pect of the remainder of the gunboats getting into position and the steamers reaching the landing-place, the order was given for the assault, the chief influenced by the perfervidum ingenium Scotorum and of the old 42nd, in which we had both held commissions. The whole line of skirmishers and supports rushed eagerly down the slojie of the hill, and advanced towards the entrenchment at as rapid a pace as the rugged and uneven nature of the intervening ground would admit, exposed the whole time to a destructive fire from the enemy. Lieut.-Colonel Austen and Captain Phelps, 14th Regiment, and many others were wounded, and fell almost directly on becom ing exposed ; the enemy's fire was sharp, quick, and heavy, but nothing could check the impetuosity of the assault. The skirmishers of the 65th Regiment having reached within fifty yards of the entrenchments, and the scaling ladders having been quickly planted under cover of the fire, the skirmishers and ladder party, followed by the support, mounted the parapet and forced their way over the enemy's first line ; then, wheeling to the left and charging up the hill, they carried the second line of rifle-"], [166, "148 RANGIRIRI. pits, and continued to drive the enemy before them, until their progress was checked by a deadly fire opened upon them from the centre redoubt, which the enemy seemed determined to defend to the last. The remainder of the troops on the left, finding it impossible to penetrate the enemy's position on that side, joined the attack on the right, and with the 65th Regiment occupied positions round the centre redoubt, almost completely enveloping the enemy. Soon after the 65th had passed the main line of entrenchment, the general had the satisfaction of seeing the 40th Regiment landing from the Pioneer and Avon, not far from the spot which had been selected. Colonel Leslie, with Irish spirit, without waiting for the companies to form, directed Captain Clarke to take the first fifty men that were landed and attack the ridge in the rear of the enemy's position, whilst he moved with 100 men round its base for the purpose of intercepting the enemy. The ridge, honeycombed with rifle-pits, was carried at once, and a great number of the enemy were killed or drowned in endeavouring to escape across the swamp of Lake Waikare. A portion of the 65th Regi ment, after passing the main line of entrenchment, joined the 40th in the attack. Leaving a detachment to occupy the ridge, Colonel Leslie, with the remainder of his regi ment, joined the force engaged at the centre redoubt. The main line, and some of the inner works, having been taken as described, the troops closed on the enemy towards the centre redoubt, where he now fought with despera tion ; and, the ladders being rather short, he held his ground against every attempt to dislodge him. The enemy continuing to defend with great tenacity and resolution, General Cameron ordered two successive assaults to be made on the redoubt, the first by the Royal Artillery, armed with swords and revolvers, led by that brave Englishman, Captain Mercer ; they were, however, unable to overcome the difficult nature of the work and the heavy fire brought to bear upon them. Captain Mercer received a severe wound through the jaw and tongue, the shot having been fired through a narrow opening of the enemy's work facing- to the rear, which he was crossing in search of a point favourable for making an entry. Every man who attempted to pass that opening"], [167, "149 NATIVES SURRENDER. afterwards was wounded, except Lieutenant Pickard, RA. : he received a Victoria Cross afterwards for nobly exposing himself to assist his fallen commanding officer, Captain Mercer, and the other wounded men, who fell after passing the opening, could not be moved out till it was masked with earth and planking. A second assault was made by ninety seamen of the Royal Navy with cutlasses and revolvers, under direction of Commodore Sir William Wiseman and Commander Mayne, of H. M.S. Eclipse. They went against the front of the work, and were received with a deadly volley, and were also unable to effect an entrance. An attempt was afterwards made by a party of seamen, under Commander Phillimore, of H.M.S. Guracoa, to dislodge the enemy from his work with hand grenades, but without success. It was now dark, and the general resolved to postpone further operations until daylight, ordering the troops to remain during the night in the several positions they had gained. At daybreak, Colonel Mould, C.B., of the Royal Engineers, suggested that a breach should be made in the redoubt by labour with the pick and shovel, and the operation was in progress, when, at six o'clock, the enemy hoisted a white flag, and 183 men surrendered unconditionally, and laid down their arms, though they had a plentiful supply of ammunition. It was understood that the works had been manned at the commencement of the action with 700 men. The surrender of arms is always a trying matter for fighting men. There was hesitation when the Maoris at Rangiriri were told to give up theirs. AtlastTe-ori-ori, the chief, handed his rifle to the general, and all then gave up their firearms. Afterwards, a leading Waikato chief made a speech : \u2014 'We fought you at Koheroa, and fought you well ; we fought you at Rangiriri, and we fought you well; and now we are friends, alee, ake, alee (for ever, for ever, for ever).' The Maoris at once cor dially fraternised with our men (I had seen the same occur at Te Arei in Taranaki), and were particularly good-humoured under their reverse. Their immediate leader was Te Piori, a remarkably fine-looking Waikato chief, and among the prisoners were several chiefs of note. They were sent to Auckland, and, as a temporary arrange ment, placed on board H.M.S. Curacoa. The list of British"], [168, "150 GATE PAH\u2014 TAURANGA. casualties amounted to 4 officers killed, 11 wounded; 37 men killed, 80 wounded. Total, 132 killed and wounded. The loss of the enemy must have been very heavy ; 41 bodies were found in and about the works, and a great many were shot or drowned in their flight across the swamp. They must have removed their wounded during the night, as, strange to say, none were found among the prisoners.\" The conflict at the Gate pah at Tauranga, in April, 1864, involving as it did the repulse of the British troops and great loss to them, was one of deep and absorbing interest. The pah was built on a narrow neck of land, with a swamp on each side ; the work was well palisaded and surrounded by a strong post and rail fence, and the space between the sides of the redoubt and the swamps was defended by an entrenched line of rifle-pits. The pah, was invested in face and in rear by the British force, which consisted of 1695 men, and, in artillery, of one 110-pounder Armstrong, two 40-pounder and two 6-pounder\" Armstrongs, two 24-pounder howitzers, two 8-inch mortars, and six Cohorn mortars. Sir James Alexander describes the attack as follows : \u2014 \" The guns and mortars, being placed in position in front of the pali, opened fire soon after daybreak on the morning of the 29th of April. General Cameron gave orders that the fire should be directed principally against the left angle of the centre work, which, from the nature of the ground, the general considered the most favourable point to assault. The practice was excellent, particularly that of the howitzers, and reflected great credit on the officers in command of batteries. About 12 o'clock, the swamp on the enemy's left having been reported by Captain Greaves, Deputy Assistant-Quartermaster-General, practicable for the passage of a gun, a 6-pounder Armstrong was taken across to the high ground on the opposite side, from which its fire completely enfiladed the left of the enemy's position, which he was thus compelled to abandon. The fire of the guns, howitzers, and mortars was continued with short intermissions for eight hours. The enemy had cleverly planted their flag-staff outside in rear of their oblong work, and the gunners directing their fire at this for a time threw away a good deal of ammunition ; but"], [169, "151 BRITISH REPULSE. at 4 p.m., when a large portion of the fence and palisading had been destroyed, and a practicable breach being made in the parapet, the assault was ordered. One hundred and fifty seamen and marines, under Commander Hay, of H.M.S. Harrier, and an equal number of the 43rd Regi ment, under Lieut. -Colonel Booth, formed the assaulting column. Major Ryan's detachment was extended as close to the works as possible, to keep down the fire from the rifle-pits, with orders to follow the assaulting column into the work. The remainder of the seamen and marines and men of the 43rd, amounting altogether to 300, followed as a reserve. When the bombardment ceased, and the signal of a rocket made Colonel Greer aware that the assault was about to take place, he moved up close round the rear of the pah, in such a position that the Maoris could not come out without being met by a strong force. They then made a determined rush for the right rear of the pah, but were met by the three companies of the 68th, and after a skirmish the main body was driven back into the pah ; about twenty got past on the right of the 68th, but they received a flank fire from Lieutenant Cox's party, sixty men of the 68th, and Lieutenant Hotham's thirty men of the Naval Brigade, and sixteen of the Maoris were seen to fall, and a number of men pursued the remainder. The men were collected again, and posted. Lieutenant Trent, 6Sth, and Lieutenant and Adjutant Covey gave valuable assistance, also Mr. Parris, who had volunteered as guide. The assaulting column, four abreast, two soldiers and two sailors, with officers on the flanks, protected by the nature of the ground, gained the breach with little loss, and effected an entrance into the body of the work, excavated and broken up, and with underground defences, most confusing to the assailants and most advantageous for the garrison. A fierce conflict ensued, in which the natives fought with the greatest desperation with guns and tomahawks. Lieut. -Colonel Booth and Commander Hay, who led into the work, fell mortally wounded ; Captain Hamilton, of the Esk, was shot dead on the top of the parapet while in the act of encouraging his men to advance. In a few minutes almost every officer of the column was either killed or wounded. Up to this moment the men, so nobly led by"], [170, "152 NATIVES ESCAPE \u2014 TE RANGE their officers, fought gallantly, and appeared to have gained the position, when they gave way, and fell back from the cover, under a heavy fire from the parapet. The repulse, without doubt, arose from the confusion occasioned by the intricate nature of the interior, honeycombed with rifle-pits and underground passages ; and the enemy lying down had, no doubt, considerable advantage in shooting at our men from concealed positions. The con fusion was increased by the men being suddenly deprived of so many of their leaders. This is the natural result in all warfare. Sir Duncan Cameron coming up, considered it unadvisable to renew the assault at the time. Night was coming on, and he directed a line of entrenchment to be thrown up within 100 yards of the work, so as to be able to maintain his advanced position, intending to resume operations on the following morning-, similar to what was intended at the Redan, eSebastopol, in 1855, and the upshot was the same. The Maoris, taking advantage of the wet and dark night which followed, stole out in small parties from the pah and escaped ; several of the posts outside observed them, and fired a volley at them, but could not stop them. The Maoris, careful to expose themselves as little as possible, did not return a shot, except some shots that were fired from the pah to deceive our force in the rear as to the garrison having left the pah.\" The loss on our side was 10 officers killed and 4 wounded ; non-commissioned officers and men killed, 21, and 76 wounded. The losses of the enemy are supposed also to have been heavy, but only 20 killed and 6 wounded were found in or about their position. It was admitted by prisoners that a large number of killed and wounded were carried away during the night. Some also were killed in attempting to make their escape from the force in the rear. The reverse at the Gate pah was soon avenged at Te Rangi, a place not far from it. Sir James Alexander writes: \"In patrolling the country beyond the Gate pah on the 21st of June, at 8 a.m., Colonel Greer came suddenly upon a large body of natives, who had just bsgun to entrench themselves about four miles beyond the Q-aXe pah. He at once attacked them, and a smart action ensued. At the commencement of the attack, Colonel"], [171, "153 NATIVE DEFEAT. Greer had with him about 600 men, and the Maoris mustered about the same number. They had made a single line of rifle-pits at Te Rangi, on a neck of land and across the road, and in a position similar to that at Puke hinahina (the Gate pah). The ravines at the two flanks were very precipitous. Having driven in some skirmishers the Maoris had thrown out, Colonel Greer extended the 43rd and a portion of the 68th in their front and on their flanks, as far as practicable, and kept up a sharp fire for about two hours, while he sent back for reinforcements, a gun and 220 men. As soon as they were sufficiently near to support, be sounded the advance, when the 43rd, 68 th, and 1st Waikato Militia charged and carried the rifle-pits in the most dashing manner, under heavy fire, but which was for the most part too high. For some time the Maoris fought desperately. Major Synge com manded the 43rd, and had his horse shot in two places, close to the rifle-pits. Major Colville, 43rd, gallantly led the left of the line of skirmishers into the rifle-pits, being himself one of the first in ; Major Shuttleworth, 68th, commanded the supports, consisting of the 68th and the 1st Waikato Militia under Captain Moore. The supports were brought up in the most soldier-like manner, and rushed at the rifle-pits at the critical moment. Captain Trent, Acting Field Officer, 68th, fell, severely wounded, when leading two companies into the left of the rifle-pits, and continued cheering on the men till the pits were taken. Captain Smith, 43rd, was the first into the right of the line of the rifle-pits ; his gallant conduct was con spicuous, so much so that he was recommended for the Victoria Cross : he was wounded severely in two places. Captain Casement, 68th, was severely wounded in two places, in front of his company, while leading into the rifle-pits. Captain Berners, 43rd, was also severely wounded in front of the rifle-pits. Captain Seymour, 68th, took Captain Trent's place when he fell, and led his men into the left of the rifle-pits. Lieutenant Stuart, 68th, was one of the first into the left line of rifle-pits, and had a personal conflict with a Maori armed with an Enfield rifle and bayonet ; but Lieutenant Stuart cut him down with his sword. Captain the Honourable A. Harris, 43rd, was detached to the right in command of two"], [172, "154 NATIVE DEFEAT. companies, 43rd, to enfilade the enemy's position, and afterwards brought the companies at the critical moment to assist in the assault. Lieutenant and Acting Adjutant Hammick, 43rd, did his duty with great coolness and courage. Lieutenant Grubb, R.A., made excellent practice with the 6-pounder at the entrenchment and on the retreating enemy. Surgeon-Major Best, 68th, P.M.O., and his assistants, Henry, 43rd, Applin, 68th, and O'Connel, Staff, were most attentive to the wounded. Lieutenant and Adjutant Covey, when conveying a message to Major Shuttleworth (from Colonel Greer), went with the supports, and was dragged into a rifle-pit by a Maori, who thrust a spear through his clothes. Ensign Palmer was struck in the neck by a musket-ball, and fell insensible from his horse alongside of Colonel Greer ; when he recovered and had his wound dressed, he performed his duty during the rest of the day. Sergeant-Major Tudor, 68th, went in front and distin guished himself in several \"personal conflicts with the enemy in the rifle-pits ; Sergeant-Major Daniels, 43rd, and Acting Sergeant-Major Lilley (70th Regiment), of the 1st Waikato Militia, also distinguished themselves by their coolness and courage. Sergeant Murray, 68th, whose gallantry and courage were so distinguished, was recommended (with evidence) for the Victoria Cross, and for this reason : Corporal J. Bryne, V.C., 68th, when the order to charge was given, was the first man of his company into the rifle-pits ; a Maori, whom he transfixed with his bayonet, seized his rifle with one hand, and holding it firm, with the bayonet through him, endeavoured to cut clown the corporal with his tomahawk : his life was saved by Sergeant Murray. Private Thomas Smith, 68th, severely wounded, and Private Caffrey, 68th, were dis tinguished by gallant conduct in the field and prowess in the rifle-pits. The natives had an intention of attacking Te Papa, but the action at Te Rangi disconcerted them. For an hour previous to the attack, a Maori reinforcement was observed coming towards the rifle-pits, yelling and firing their guns, aud they were only five hundred yards from the pits when the advance was sounded. Besides the six officers wounded, as detailed, there were 10 men killed aud 33 wounded. The enemy's loss amounted to"], [173, "155 WEREROA. 108 bodies buried on the 22nd of June in the rifle-pits dug on the 21st; 15 wounded, afterwards died; 11 un wounded and 12 wounded prisoners remained in hospital ; total, 146 Maoris accounted for. Both the Light Regi ments did credit to their old good name ; and it was a matter of special satisfaction that the 43rd had an oppor tunity at Te Rangi of recovering from any depression they may have felt on account of the unlooked-for repulse at the Gate pah. Colonel Greer paid a tribute to the Maoris, and remarked on their gallant stand at the rifle pits; they stood the charge without flinching, and did not retire until forced out at the point of the bayonet.\" The next and last description which I quote from Sir James Alexander's book, to which I am largely indebted for incidents in the New Zealand War, is that of the capture, in July, 1865, of the Wereroa pah, a strong native position on high ground up the Waitotara river, a little way to the northward of Wanganui. The capture of the place was remarkable, because it was mainly effected by the colonial forces and native allies under the personal direction of Governor Sir George Grey. The general, Sir Duncan Cameron, who was then on the eve of his departure from New Zealand, was not in favour of an attack on that pah at that season of the year. He allowed, however, a military post of regular troops near the pah, to give its moral support, by its presence in front of the place, to the colonial forces and friendly natives engaged in the attack. The account, therefore, of the affair, coming as it does from a high and able military officer like Major-General Sir James Alexander, is specially valuable. He writes as follows : \u2014 \" The Wereroa pah stood about 300 feet above the wooded banks of the Waitotara. There were woods, and broken country, and occasional swamps all round, quite a picture of New Zealand scenery. The front of the pah, on its high plateau, formed, as it were, the base of a triangle, one end of which rested on the Koie stream, the other on the Waitotara river. On the right bank of the Koie was a precipitous wooded ridge, somewhat higher than that on which the pah stood. The right bank of the Koie stream then afforded excellent cover for riflemen, and commanded a great part of the pah itself. The front of the pah stood"], [174, "156 WEREROA. at the head of a gentle slope, which fell gradually away from the pah, for a distance of more than 1000 yards, when the ground began again gradually to rise. The front face of the pah was very strongly fortified with palisading and rifle-pits. It was not expected that a force would advance to attack the pah by the precipitous valleys on its flanks, where the cliffs formed the chief defence. Sir George Grey determined to occupy by surprise the heights commanding the pah, and by a force, if possible, strong enough to repel any sortie from the pah (which would be at the same time threatened in front), and also strong enough to repulse or capture any reinforcements that might be coming up. Brigadier- General Waddy had arranged to establish a post of 400 men of the regular troops about 900 yards from the fortress, to afford Her Majesty's colonial forces and the native allies that moral support they were certain to derive from the presence of British troops in front of the place. He also ordered a detachment of artillery to co-operate in front, to breach and shell the works, if necessary. The colonial troops were 25 Wanganui Cavalry, 139 Forest Rangers, 109 Native Contingent, 200 efficient friendly natives, and several old warriors, total 473. A post at Pipiriki, commanded by Captain Brassey, was placed in a very critical position \u2014 threatened with attack by a large body of natives ; but until Wereroa fell, it was impossible to detach a party to assist Captain Brassey, so no time was to be lost in trying to gain possession of Wereroa. Sir George Grey, taking- the direction of the operations, determined to occupy the heights round the pah, to shut in its defenders, and to harass them with rifle and artillery fire. Mr. Parris, the interpreter, communicated to the native allies the intentions of the Governor, and had them on the alert on the morning of the 20th of July. Lieut. - Colonel Trevor, with 100 men of the 14th Regiment, arrived early on the morning of the 20th, and pitched his tents in front of the pah, about 1300 yards from it, and between the camps of the native allies and the Forest Rangers ; Captain Noblctt, 18th Royal Irish, with 100, men, also arrived on the ground to co-operate, and pitched his tents in rear of the 14th. At half-past twelve, the colonial and native forces, under Major Rooke's command, paraded"], [175, "157 COLONIAL AND NATIVE FORCES. out of sight of the pah, and moved off north to the Karaka heights, by a path concealed from the view of the pah. It rained heavily, which, though inconvenient to the men marching, helped to conceal the well-devised movement. The supplies of food were short, yet there were no complaints, and all were anxious to execute what had been assigned to them to attempt ; they were ' strong and of good courage.' The Forest Rangers were under the command of Captain George, the Native Contingent under Captain MacDonnell, the friendly natives under their several chiefs ; and the whole, under Major Rooke, reached the Karaka heights by ravines and broken and wooded ground, by half-past six o'clock p.m. after dark. From the time the colonial forces left (with the exception of a few friendly natives), the regular troops, 200 in number, under the command of Lieut-Colonel Trevor, were the only force in front of the pah. Sir George Grey after wards said, ' Without the presence of this force, the operations could not have been carried on. Nothing could have surpassed the zeal and energy of Lieut. -Colonel Trevor ; and to his cordial co-operation, and advice on several occasions, much of the success which followed must be attributed. The officers and men of the regular troops all exhibited the greatest alacrity and interest in what was going on. . . . Without their presence, and without the cordial energetic assistance which they gave, nothing could have been done.' Of course there was great risk in dividing the force, but appearances were well kept up, and the natives in the pah were deceived, all the tents being left pitched in view of the pah. Captain Brassey's critical position at Pipiriki required the risk to be run. But if the enemy had suspected that only 200 men were in their front, as at Nukumaru, they might have sallied out in great numbers, and tried the mettle of the 14th and 18th in a bloody conflict. In the course of the night Major Rooke asked the chief Haimona to send spies to a kainga, or village, near ; they reported that there was no one there : but not satisfied with that, the major detached a party under Captain MacDonnell at half -past four in the morning to the kainga, who surprised and captured a reinforcement for the pah, and made fifty prisoners, fifty stand of arms, and two"], [176, "158 WEREROA PAH CAPTURED. kegs of ammunition. Great credit was due for this to Captain MacDonnell and his men. At daybreak on the morning of the 21st, rifle-shots from the Karaka heights into Wereroa pah wakened its defenders ; they were taken by surprise, and evidently fell into confusion, not expecting an attack from the north side. The native chiefs left in camp with Colonel Trevor became naturally anxious at their critical position ; to reassure them he sent for fifty more men of the 14th to Nukumaru, and for fifty more, 18th, to Waitotara. The 200 regulars expected from Wanganui had not arrived, but the operations went on : Major Rooke to harass the enemy in the pah by day, and laying ambuscades at night ; Colonel Trevor to make a sham attack on the pah in front, to enable Major Rooke to take the Parima village on his side ; and the friendly natives occupying the ground on the west side of the Waitotara river. At sunset, the pickets falling in and marching to the front led the enemy to suppose the troops were forming for a night attack ; the garrison was seen to be in confusion, and running about for shelter from the rifle-shots from the heights. Major Rooke, 18th, arriving in command of a party from the Waitotara, reported to Colonel Trevor he had seen, with a telescope, natives descending the cliffs and precipitous banks with packs, and escaping by the only outlet from the pah. At ten o'clock, 21st, Major Rooke ascertained from a native scout that the pali was evacuated, and he had the satisfaction of writing Sir George Grey, ' The Wereroa is yours.' It was immediately taken possession of by the friendly natives, and then garrisoned by Colonel Trevor and the 14th detachment. Great credit is due to all engaged in the capture of the Wereroa pah. Sir George Grey planned the attack, and the regular troops eagerly aided him \" (Lieut.-Colonel Trevor was afterwards rewarded with the C.B.), \" aud to Major Rooke, Captain George, Captain and Adjutant Ross, and to the native chiefs, Haimona, Te Kepa, Epiha, Aperamiko, and Karehana, great praise was accorded.\""], [177, "159 ADMINISTRA TIVE DIFFICUL TIES.

The political complications which the war caused were grave. They were not abstract points which could be rele gated to philosophic discussion ; they involved hard prac tical consequences which had a direct injurious effect on the interests of New Zealand \u2014 consequences which entailed heavy sacrifices, embarrassed administration, and retarded colonisation. It is often thought that constitutional rela tions are not of much importance ; and that even politics are, as a rule, more suitable to schools of debate than to practical life. Experience should have taught a contrary lesson. Government is the great engine, and politics are its machinery. Both involve the social welfare of the governed. When the engine and the machinery are out of order and work badly, individuals are more or less injuriously affected. We may turn aside from politics, but politics do not turn aside from us. Politics, like natural laws, exact strict retribution for neglect or mis management. Coming back to the case of New Zealand, the conviction forces itself on the reflecting mind that, from the first operation of the Constitutional Act of 1852, the question of native government in New Zealand became pregnant with momentous consequences. The Act did not put that question on a proper footing, and the sub sequent efforts to complete what was defective failed. Governor Gore Browne retained the management of native affairs in his own hands, and that arrangement broke"], [178, "160 EXECUTIVE DISUNION. down. The attempt to give native local self-government did not succeed ; and afterwards the Governor and the Cabinet plunged the colony into a native war, on a wrong issue, at the wrong time, and under other unfavourable conditions. Governor Sir George Grey came too late to reverse the evil effects of what had been done. He did, however, at first much good. He restored confidence to many wavering native tribes, and he eliminated from the contest the chief element of wrong on our part. More over, by conceding to his Ministers constitutional responsi bility in native affairs, he did what he could to secure unity and strength in native administration. His action in this respect was confirmed by the Home Government. Unfortunately, the two Houses of the New Zealand Legis lature interfered by ill-advised addresses to the Crown, trying to neutralize what had been done and to evade their constitutional responsibilities. This imprudent course, although it did not alter the decision of the Home Govern ment, had a disastrous effect. It irritated the imperial authorities, and, what was worse, it practically disorgan ised the relations between the Governor and his Ministers. From the date of these addresses the Governor and his Ministers were placed in a position of mutual antagonism; they no longer acted, so long as they could constitution ally act with each other, as one mind in one body, but as two alien forces which it was difficult to combine, and which, naturally, were estranged from each other. Dis trust prevailed where confidence should have reigned alone. Executive action was no longer prompt, direct, and decisive ; it was delayed, distracted, and often annihi lated by preliminary discussion and controversy embodied, in that most dangerous shape, in writing intended for publication. The consequent evils became more and more frequent and more and more grave. Even in tranquil times anomalous administration of this kind is bad enough, but, in critical times like those of war, when unanimity, vigour, and promptitude of action are more than ever essential, it is infinitely worse. Self-contradictory and suicidal government is fatal to the proper conduct of war and to the restoration of honourable and permanent peace. The spirit of contention is a disease which spreads ; it is an epidemic of evil. Between the Governor and his Minis-"], [179, "COLONIAL FORCES \u2014 CONFISCATION. 161 ters it increased and multiplied ; and it broke out between the Colonial and the Home Governments. The Home Government persisted in finding fault with the colony for not taking (so it was alleged) its fair share in providing men and money for the war. The complaint was essen tially unjust, for, at the time, the colony was devoting all its resources to military operations. The colony may be truly said to be then bleeding at every pore ; colonisation was stopped ; capital was decreasing ; labonr was leaving for other countries ; industry in the North Island was paralyzed ; and the public credit of the whole colony was strained. The military contribution of the colony, in pro portion to its means, was very large ; in men alone the colony provided and placed under the command of the general, in addition to its militia and volunteers, five regiments raised in Victoria and elsewhere. It is only the exact truth to say that it would have been hopeless for the colony to have done then and afterwards as much as it did, had it not been, happily, that the South Island was exempt from the actual presence of war, and that the gold discoveries in Otago gave a great impetus to colonisation in that island. Another course of discord arose from the partial confiscation, effected under a special law for the purpose, of lands belonging to natives in arms against the Crown. The law on this subject, with certain modifications suggested by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, was passed by the Colonial Legislature, and was left by the Crown to its operation. And it must, I think, be generally admitted that in principle the law was, under the circumstances, just and prudent. The best way of permanently proving to the native race that insurrection would entail lasting punishment was to mulct the offend ing tribes of part of their landed possessions. This punishment was justifiable, not merely as a retribution, but as the means of probably providing against the recur rence of insurrection. The measure, also, if properly administered, was prudent, for the confiscated land, peopled by loyal and industrious settlers, would be so much addi tional strength on the side of future tranquillity. At the same time, there is no doubt that the conditions under which this system of confiscation could be properly ad ministered were difficult and delicate in character, and M"], [180, "162 CONFISCA TION \u2014 CAL UMNY. that their satisfactory fulfilment required, on the part of all concerned in fulfilling them, ability, forbearance, good faith, judgment, and hearty co-operation. Unfortunately, the Home Government were unfriendly to the system, which they first practically allowed, and then did their best to thwart when they could have given useful aid. And, what is more inexcusable, they lent a willing ear to those who slandered the colony by representing it as anxious to prolong the war for the sake of confiscating native land. A falser charge could not be made. Confiscation, preceded by war, would, under most favourable circumstances, be a costly and wasteful mode of acquiring land for purposes of colonisation. Apart altogether from the morality of the question, the colonists would have been absolutely senseless if, in full view and in bitter experience of what the war brought on them, they had wished to prolong the war for the sake of getting hold of native lands. It would have been infinitely cheaper to have bought the lands in the usual way. The truth is that, on the one hand, the colony was anxious enough to bring the war to a speedy close, but it was also naturally anxious that the close should be effected under conditions which would lessen as much as possible the likelihood of its recurrence. The Home Government, on the other hand, wished, quo cunque modo, to be quit of the war, and to leave the colony to take care of itself. It was this feeling which underlay the unfriendly attitude of the Home Government towards the colony from 1862 to 1870. The collapse of confiscation was partly owing to this attitude of the Home Government, and partly to the discord on the subject in 1864 and 1865 between the Governor and his Ministers. I have said that the Home Government lent a willing ear to slanders of the colony on the subject of confiscation. I may add that, once allowed, this vicious practice soon became more comprehensive and malignant. Secret accu- sations, emanating from the colony and from England, against the colonists and the Colonial Government, flowed uninterruptedly into the ears of imperial authorities. Calumny of New Zealand became at home almost a public institution. The charges made, when brought to light, were invariably refuted, but it is impossible to say how much evil the poison wrought before they were brought"], [181, "WITHDRAWAL OF IMPERIAL TROOPS. 163 to light, and when, as, no doubt, in numberless instances, they were not brought to light at all. The home autho rities were much to blame in receiving and entertaining them (as was done), and in being influenced by them. The rule, then honoured more in the breach than in the observance, should have been followed that communica tions implicating the conduct of persons in a colony, intended for the Home Government, should be sent through the Governor of that colony. In that way accusations and defences would arrive in England simultaneously. All these complications made the state of public affairs in New Zealand in 1863 and 1864 a scandal and an intolerable grievance ; so much so that, towards the close of 1864, Sir Frederick Weld (then Mr. Weld) formed a Ministry on the principle of asking the Home Government to withdraw imperial troops and imperial interference in native affairs, and to allow complete colonial responsibility to be established. This policy, in the positive terms in which it was at first framed, while actual war was going on, savoured more of courage than of prudence. The House of Representatives cautiously qualified the pro posal ; but it gave the Home Government the opening which they eagerly awaited, and they availed themselves of it in a spirit more selfish than considerate to New Zealand. They were eager to act at once on the proposal for the withdrawal of all imperial troops from New Zea land, but circumstances fortunately delayed that complete withdrawal for two years, and allowed time for preparation. As it was, the colony for a time was placed in a position of great peril. At last, in 1870, New Zealand, at great sacrifice to itself, and by the energy and valour of its own forces, brought the war to an honourable and per manent conclusion. But the war left terrible traces for many years afterwards ; and the necessary measures of preparation for its possible outbreak again have been a severe strain on colonial resources. The war, of course, during its progress had a disastrous effect on colonisation. So far as the North Island was concerned, the effect was for the time fatal to the advance of industry. Settlement there languished and retrograded ; each district was in a feverish state of military excite ment, and the busy hum of industrial work was silenced"], [182, "164 OTAG 0\u2014 CANTERB UR Y. by the din of arms. Fortunately, the South Island was in a great measure a source of compensation. War was unknown there except by the heavier burden of taxation which it imposed. The industry of the southern settlers and the progress of southern settlements were not sum marily arrested. The provincial authorities, on whom at the time the conduct of colonisation practically devolved, had in the South Island comparatively free hands. No native difficulties there existed in connection with the administration of public lands and the construction of public works ; and in Canterbury and Otago there was a large available land fund. Moreover, in those two provinces exceptional factors exercised a powerful force in rapid colonisation between 1860 and 1870. In Otago, gold was discovered in 1861, and that discovery, followed quickly by other discoveries of the same kind, advanced the entire province in the course of four or five years a whole generation in population and in the settlement of the country. In 1859, the population of Otago was about 10,500 in number, and in 1867 (a year in which the census was taken), within the same boundaries, it numbered 56,520. In the district of Westland, which was included within the province of Canterbury till 1867, gold was discovered in 1865. In 1859, the population of Canterbury was about 12,500 ; and in 1867, inclusively of Westland, it was 53,866. Exemption from native troubles, the pos session of large land revenues, and the discovery of gold in great quantity, soon made the two provinces of Otago and Canterbury wealthy and progressive. The country was opened up by the Provincial Governments in every direction by bridges and excellent roads ; and railways joining Dunedin and Port Chalmers (in Otago) and Christchurch and Port Lyttelton (in Canterbury) respec tively were made. In Canterbury, two great provincial public works deserve special mention. A tunnel, 2838 yards in length, was cut through the lofty range of hills which intercepted overland communication between Christchurch and its port, Port Lyttelton, seven miles distant. This work was undertaken, under the authority of Mr. W. S. Moorhonse, the energetic Superintendent of Canterbury, before gold was discovered in Westland. The other great provincial work in Canterbury was the road"], [183, "WESTLAND \u2014 PROVINCIAL SYSTEM. 165 which joined the east and west coasts of the province soon after the gold discoveries in Westland in 1865. The Southern Alps at first apparently cut off all overland communication between those two coasts ; but a practicable pass was found, and in 1886 the Provincial Government of Canterbury made a coach road over mountains 3000 feet in height. This road, 149 miles long from Christ church to Hokitika, cost \u00a3150,000 ; and so quickly was it constructed that in the same year, 1866, a four-horse mail-coach regularly ran the whole distance twice a week, each way in two days, stopping one night on the road. At one place, also, in the North Island, rich discoveries of gold were made in 1867 and afterwards, about forty five miles to the eastward of the city of Auckland. These discoveries were made when the Auckland settlement was in a very depressed condition. Between August, 1867, and July, 1869, the value of gold obtained at the Thames was \u00a3264,425. In 1864, the seat of government was authorised by resolutions of the Houses of the Legislature to be removed from Auckland to Wellington. This removal was effected in the early part of 1865. The selection of Wellington was made on the ground of its more central situation and of its greater accessibility from all parts of the colony. The constitutional duplex system (colonial and pro vincial) did not on the whole work well, though it was in some respects a good thing that, under the circumstances, Provincial Councils and Provincial Superintendents in the South Island were charged with colonising functions, because, in the absence of war, they were able to discharge those functions effectively. But nevertheless the disloca tion which existed between the colonial and provincial systems of machinery in administration and legislation was detrimental to the best interests of New Zealand at the time, and portended worse for the future. The provinces were willing to use the executive and legislative authority of the colony as a convenient tool for their own purposes, but otherwise they resented its interference. The Superintendents and the Colonial Ministers were in a chronic state of mutual disagreement ; and the legislation of the Colonial Parliament threw provincial legislation into uncertainty and confusion. Sound finance was rendered"], [184, "166 FINANCE \u2014 NEW PROVINCES. impossible. Provincial revenues were almost altogether derived from surplus colonial revenue under Colonial Acts, or appropriations by annual votes \u2014 Acts and appropria tions liable at any time to change, according to variable colonial exigencies. Those who represented provincial interests in the Colonial House of Representatives were always anxious to starve the colony in order to fatten the provinces ; and, vice versa, those who were of opposite opinions strove in the contrary direction. The land revenue, which, under the exceptional circumstances of the country, needed careful, considerate, and equitable adjustment of expenditure, was dealt with as the patrimony of the province in which it was collected, and, practically, with the effect of filling the rich with good things, and of sending the hungry empty away. In finance, the Colonial Treasurer was always attempting to square a circle, and he never succeeded. Figures never would make facts. Ingenuity was strained to the utmost to make each Budget a yearly kaleidoscope, but, disguised as it was, the fact became more and more palpable that the colony was, from want of proper adjustment in the two systems of government, increasing its debt and getting less for what it spent. This arose, apart from the effects of the war, from a vicious system of finance created by constitutional discord. Provincial borrowing added to the financial chaos. There is, no doubt, good policy in loans on certain terms and to a limited extent, expended on great public works which are, directly or indirectly, reproductive, and which make the transaction in effect a prudent investment. But the borrowing in question did not fulfil those con ditions. The interest paid by provinces was much higher than that paid by the colony ; and the distribution and expenditure of the money were, in a comparatively small community, too often subject to political rather than to economical considerations. The distribution of provincial money raised questions often affecting the integrity of the province itself. As settlement spread, the outlying parts cried out against centralism of administration and expenditure, and wanted special powers for their own local self-government. The parent provinces, although, as originally formed when New Zealand, in 1853, was geographically divided into six provinces, they did not at"], [185, "CONSTITUTIONAL DIFFICULTIES. 167 all comprise homogeneous districts, grudged the grant of these special powers to their outlying parts. The Colonial Legislature interfered and allowed on specific conditions compulsory separation. Hawke's Bay district, originally part of the province of Wellington, was created a separate province in 1858. Marlborough was originally part of the province of Nelson, and was constituted a separate province in 1859. In 1861, Southland, the southern portion of Otago, was made a separate province, but in 1870 it was re-united to Otago. In 1867, Westland was separated from Canterbury. Provincial multiplication, however just in itself, only added, under the existing political system, to colonial vexation. Waste of power and waste of money increased ; and, in place of harmony and co-operation, discord and conflict waxed stronger. Now, discord and conflict, in a certain sense, are necessary and, within proper limits, wholesome adjuncts to representative insti tutions. Constitutionally conducted, they tend to check haste, to counteract excess, and to promote good ; they are evils when they are perverted to the practice of indis criminate and persistent hindrance. Obstruction has been well defined to be the substitution of force for argument ; and when the action of a minority is of that kind, con stitutional disintegration begins. In the case of New Zealand, the system was more in fault than the men, though of course, indirectly, those who badly adjusted the working parts of the system, and those who made grave mistakes in working it, are responsible. What I intend to convey is that public men, as a body, worked in good faith, and that it cannot be truly said of any section of them that their action was revolutionary or unconsti tutional. The right course was very obscure and intricate, and circumstances often made it impracticable. On the whole, looking back to the seventeen years of the political history of New Zealand, from 1853 to 1870, I do not think that there is any other colony, I may almost say any other country, which during that time presented, in kind apart from extent, more difficult political problems for solution by public men, and, comparatively speaking, was so severe a school of statesmanship. Before I proceed, I take the year 1871 (a census year) as another period at which to pause and, for a few"], [186, "168 COLONY, 1871. moments, survey New Zealand in the more prominent phases of its colonising aspect. Statistical information is inserted in the Appendix.* I only refer here to the more striking features. The total European population of the colony was 266,986 in number. Among the exports of New Zealand, which, during 1871, were in value a little above five millions, the export of gold constituted more than half the amount. Wheat, provisions, tallow, and timber came in value to half a million. Steamers closely connected by sea the various settlements with each other, and the colony as a whole with Australia and England. Railways had been begun here and there by the Provincial Governments in Canterbury, Otago, and Southland, and the colony was then just undertaking a large and compre hensive railway system. The electric telegraph was largely at work within New Zealand. Moreover, the year 1871, a memorable year in the annals of New Zealand, marked the close of the war and the commencement again of systematic colonisation ; not, how ever, as in former years, in fits and starts, and within only certain limited portions of New Zealand, but systematic ally throughout the whole colony. The general govern ment for the first time began to take up its proper position, looking at colonisation as its own primary work, in which, while welcoming provincial aid, it would no longer be a mere onlooker. It was time that something in the way of a creative and reproductive policy should be tried. The colony was staggering under the effects of the war. Several millions had been added to the public debt ; property of immense value had been destroyed ; and colonisation in the North Island was paralysed. The South Island had, as I have stated, made exceptional progress, owing to its exemption from war and from native difficulties within itself, and to the fortunate dis covery in Otago and Westland of rich gold-fields ; but, indirectly, it suffered much, financially and otherwise, from the war in its sister island. The characteristic feature, in 1871, of colonisation in New Zealand, as a whole, was stagnation. Industry languished ; capital was withheld ; property was depressed ; employment, except in the gold-fields and in their vicinity, was difficult to be * Appendix B."], [187, "169 COLONY, 1871\u2014 PUBLIC BORROWING. obtained ; and the scanty population attached to the soil was altogether inadequate to the development of the resources of the country. Exclusively of the mining communities which the finding of gold had suddenly created, and which the stoppage of that finding would as suddenly disperse into other countries, colonisation was at a standstill. And yet, apart from the precious metal, the country was teeming with latent elements of industrial wealth. The colony needed population and facilities for internal and external communication : internal, so as to open up the interior, connect settlements, and give pro- ductiveness to waste places by making markets easily accessible ; and external, by the promotion of coastal commerce and of commerce with Australia, England, America, and the whole world. New Zealand, in fact, needed life from within and from without. Restoration of peace, bringing with it security for person and pro- perty, gave a fair prospect of launching a policy of that kind, and of its subsequent success. There was no doubt that, in the then existing circumstances of New Zealand, such a policy involved the necessity of borrowing largely; but it is a mistake to condemn all public borrowing. The propriety of that borrowing altogether depends on the amount borrowed, on its cost, on the purposes to which the proceeds are devoted, and on general administration. Supposing that the amount be reasonable, the price pay- able not high, that the money be spent on reproductive public works, and that the general administration be economical and good, the policy of public borrowing for a young and progressive colony is wise and provident. Expenditure, on these conditions, of borrowed money is a profitable investment of money. Reproductiveness of public expenditure in a colony does not always take the shape of direct dividends; but it is essentially reproductive- ness if public profit, more or less, can be traced in the more rapid increase of permanent settlers, in the greater progress of commercial, pastoral, agricultural, mining, and manufacturing industries, and in the larger promotion of general welfare. I do not say that the reproductiveness of borrowed money should altogether consist in these indirect results, but I certainly contend that they should fairly be taken into account, when a balance is struck of"], [188, "170 PUBLIC WORKS POLICY, 1870. profit and loss on public loans. Nor am I about to argue that all these conditions have been satisfactorily fulfilled in the case of the New Zealand Debt since 1870. Far from doing so, I merely wish, by premising what may be considered a perfect system of public borrowing, to aid the reader in judging where, and to what extent, and why the system adopted in New Zealand fell, in practice, short of the standard. It is unjust to lay on the system the blame which should be attached to the mistakes of the men who administered that system, or to circumstances which they could not control. My object is to probe the policy with a view to better ascertaining its intrinsic merits and defects. Many persons are under the impression that the public works policy of 1870 was altogether original, and that a policy of the kind had never before been proposed in New Zealand. That impression is incorrect, for on three occa sions previously a policy similar in principle, though differing in degree, had been proposed. Mr. Domett, a man of great ability who, I am sorry to say, has lately died, drew up, when he was Prime Minister of the Colony in 1863, a statesmanlike scheme for the settlement and self-defence of the North Island, based on the principle of borrowing money for immigration and public works. Mr. Reader Wood, when he was Colonial Treasurer in 1864, proposed a modified scheme to a like effect. Mr. William (now Sir William) Fitzherbert, in 1868, when, as a mem ber of the Stafford Ministry, he was in England on a financial mission, recommended to his colleagues a policy in which immigration and public works were distinguish ing features. But these three proposals were still-born. \"The trail of the serpent\" was \"over them all;\" the war absorbed all attention, and interposed insuperable obstacles to the proper undertaking of colonisation. The hour and the man came in 1870. Tranquillity prevailed throughout New Zealand ; and Mr. Julius (now Sir Julius) Vogel, Colonial Treasurer at the time, proposed to his colleagues the scheme of the public works policy of 1870, as it is generally known, and, with their concurrence, submitted it in that year to the New Zealand Parliament. The leading features of the policy were \u2014 to raise a loan of ten millions, and to spend it over a course of years in"], [189, "171 PUBLIC WORKS POLICY, 1870. systematic immigration, in the construction of a main trunk railway throughout the length of each island, in the em ployment of immigrants on the railway work and in their ultimate settlement within large blocks of land reserved near the lines of railway, in the construction of main roads, in the purchase of native lands in the North Island, in the supply of water-power on gold-fields, and in the extension of the telegraph. The plan, with some modifi cations, was authorised by the Legislature. These modifica tions mostly related to the amount to be borrowed and to its expenditure ; but there was one alteration which crippled the whole policy. The reservation of large tracts of Crown land through which the railways were intended to be made, with a view to the use of that land for settle ment thereon, and as the means of recouping to the colony a great part of the railway expenditure, was with drawn by the Government from fear of losing the whole scheme. That fear was not unfounded, inasmuch as provincial opposition to the reservation in question, con bined with the opposition of those who disliked the whole scheme, would have seriously endangered its existence. The provincial opposition was confined to the reservation of land for colonial purposes, and obviously arose from the short-sighted view that Crown land should remain, as it practically had been made, provincial property. Look ing back at the whole question by the light of experience, I do not hesitate to say that the Ministry of the day should never have given up, as an essential condition of the policy, the reservation of Crown land for railway and colonising* purposes, but have staked its existence on its adoption. The omission of that part has almost been fatal to the whole policy ; it has necessitated the* frequent recurrence of borrowing large sums in order to continue work which had been begun and was useless while it was unfinished, instead of making, as would have been the case under a proper system of land reservation, the work itself to a great extent, if not altogether, self-supporting and self extending*; and that deplorable omission has also frus trated the anticipated conduct of progressive colonisation concurrently with the progress of the railways. The result of not insisting on this fundamental condition has been what should have been foreseen and obviated. The"], [190, "172 ABOLITION OF PROVINCES. Provincial Governments sold land in the vicinity of the intended railways, and expended the proceeds for pro vincial purposes; and, as a rule, speculative capitalists absorbed the land and the profits which should have been devoted to colonisation and to the railway fund. Another grave mistake was made in 1875 by the Government in relation to the public works policy. There is no doubt that the constitutional existence of provinces in the poli tical shapes which had been given to them was the cause of grave embarrassments to the Colonial Government in carrying on a large system of public works and of immi gration. The powers and functions of provincial authorities were continually clashing with colonial administration, and were thus creating confusion, waste of power and of money, and failure of success. The problem for solu tion was how to adjust the two forces so as to produce harmony of combination and unity of effect. That solu tion was not impracticable, although it had been made more difficult by maiming the policy of 1870. The alleged justification in 1870 for that imprudent act was the alter native of losing the policy altogether. There was no such justification for the course pursued in 1875. The Govern ment then had a majority in the House of Representatives against provincialism ; and they made the great mistake of using- their power in abolishing provincial institutions, instead of modifying the institutions and adjusting them to existing circumstances. Provincial institutions had, no doubt, from various causes outgrown the necessities of the country, and had, in fact, become incongruous ; but they still contained the essence of local self-govern ment, and they only needed careful readjustment. Ade quate local self-government was a necessity to New Zealand, and any dealing with provincial institutions should have been subordinated to that primary object. Their total abolition, and the substituted division of New Zealand into sixty or seventy counties, each with a council of its own, did not give the local self-government required. The consequence was that centralism was unduly magnified, and, among other evils, the Parliament of New Zealand became a monster department of public works. This was another grievous blow to the policy of 1870. The House of Representatives degenerated into"], [191, "173 ABOLITION OF PROVINCES. an assembly of delegates clamouring for works in their several districts. A vicious system of \" log-rolling \" \u2014 an expressive Americanism for co-operative public jobbery \u2014 prevailed, and Ministries were strongly suspected of yield ing to the temptation of party motives in the distribution of public works. Money was wasted, and political demora lisation flourished. The provinces had become, politically, integral parts of New Zealand, and, with all their faults, did much of the work of local self-government. All that was needed was to change, in some respects, their consti tutional machinery, and to bring it into gear with the machinery of the colonial institutions. As river walls and other works are necessary in rivers which wear away their banks and occasionally turn fertile fields into beds of shingle, so the provinces had stood, and might, with certain adaptations to new conditions, have continued to stand, as conservative bulwarks against the inroads of central excess. The grave mistake was abolition instead of amendment. The county system was an utterly inadequate substitute, and would be so for many years. In the mean time, the change caused much waste of public money and much loss of public worth. Lax and impro vident expenditure led to recurrent borrowing, and each reacted on the other with cumulative evil effect. Pro fligate finance was contagious throughout the country. Local bodies and private individuals followed the bad example of lavish borrowing. At the same time, in spite of the serious defects, to which I have referred, in the public works policy, and in spite of many mistakes in the details of administration, there is no doubt but that the policy has been substantially and on the whole a success, inasmuch as it has greatly increased the population, ex tended settlement, and developed the resources of New Zealand. The pressure of the public debt and occasional seasons of depression are insignificant in comparison with the actual resources of the country and with its progressive condition. Prudent and economical administration is needed, and, no doubt, will be resorted to, for in a self governing country the evil and the cure are generally found close to each other ; and, in the case of New Zealand, youth and natural vigour are moral assurances of quick recovery. But I reserve the further consideration of this subject to"], [192, "174 CONDITION OF COLONY, 1881. another place. At present, I content myself with pro- posing to show, in comparison with what I have already shown was the condition of the colony in 1871, what it be- came in 1881, ten years after the inauguration of the public works policy, notwithstanding all the adverse conditions under which the policy was launched and administered. The year 1881 was a census year, and I insert in the Appendix some statistical figures, referring here to the more prominent proofs of progress. The European population in the colony was nearly doubled since 1871. The excess of immigration over emigration alone had added above 130,000 persons. Cultivation and stock had enormously increased. The value of exports, notwithstanding a fall in the product of that precarious industry, gold-mining, had increased by above half a million, thus showing a material increase in staple industries. Agriculture, which is the essence of colonisation, showed a most satisfactory increase. Telegraphic communication had been extended to the United Kingdom. The number of miles of railway, the property of the colony and open for traffic, constructed during the ten years was thirteen hundred. On the other hand, the increase of the public debt of New Zealand must be taken into account. In round numbers, that increase was twenty-two and a half millions, involving a yearly payment of about one million for interest thereon. It should, however, be borne in mind that twelve millions were expended during that time on immigration and rail- ways, and that large additional sums were devoted to ser vices which, more or less, indirectly add to the wealth of the colony. Take roads, for instance. The loan expendi- ture on roads was a million and a half. No direct income is derived from roads, but they obviously tend to the pro- gress of the colony. Another million was applied to the purchase of native territory, which was thus added to Crown territory, to be disposed of under the land regula tions for the purposes of settlement; causing this expen- diture to be both directly and indirectly reproductive. The whole loan, it may be truly said, was expended on services which had for their object the development and extension of industrial pursuits, and the general welfare of the colony. The growth of banking from 1872 to 1882 was an"], [193, "175 CONDITION OF COLONY, 1881. important indication of the advance of the colony. The deposits not bearing interest were more than doubled, and the deposits bearing interest were trebled in the course of those ten years. During that time, manufactories, machines, and other works had sprung up or extended themselves. Industries representing the manufacture of agricultural implements and machinery, of furniture, of chemicals, of textile fabrics, of dress and of fibrous materials, in mining and in metals, and in preserving animal food had taken firm root. Mining for coal was becoming a prominent industry. In four years the output of coal from New Zealand mines had more than trebled. Another good test of the progress and social condition of the colony was its credit in the English money market. The loan of 1871 at 5 per cent, interest was obtained at an average price of \u00a395 16s. 9d. for \u00a3100 bonds. The five million loan of 1879 was at 5 per cent, interest, and the issue price was \u00a397 10s., the holders having the option of receiving \u00a3120 of 4 per cent, in exchange. The loan for a million in January, 1883 (taking a somewhat later date for the sake of comparison), was at 4 per cent, interest, and the average price was \u00a398 12s. 5ei. for each hundred pounds. Therefore in the beginning of 1883 the colony got nearly 3 per cent, more for a 4 per cent, loan than it did in 1871 for a 5 per cent. loan. The 4 per cent, loan of 1883 was quoted on the 12th of March, 1883, at 1001-. During this remarkable course of material advancement the educational interests of the community had not been ignored. A public system of education was instituted. As there is no State Church in New Zealand, the State, as such, has no relation to, or connection with, any religious denomination. Accordingly, the State did not give or aid religious teaching, but it established schools of its own, in which, for at least four hours a day on five days in the week, the teaching must be purely secular. Opportunities are afforded to clergymen and others to give religious instruction outside the four hours fixed for the ordinary schoolwork to those children whose parents or guardians wish them to attend at such religious instruction. The secular subjects taught are reading, writing, arithmetic, English grammar and composition, geography, history,"], [194, "176 CONDITION OF COLONY, 1881. elementary science, drawing, object lessons, vocal music, and (for girls) sewing and needlework, and the principles of domestic economy. No child whose parents or guardians object need be present at the teaching of history. The class-books used in the schools must be only such as are approved by the Governor in Council. The Bible, Biblical history, and other Biblical manuals are excluded from the authorised list. Where a secondary or higher class of school cannot be maintained, a State school maybe changed into a district high school, where, in addition to the edu- cation in the primary schools, the ancient and modern languages, mathematics, science, etc., may be taught. Taking three years from 1878 to 1881, the centesimal in- crease of children attending Government and aided schools was 39'68. There was also a satisfactory increase in the number of native village schools and of native boarding schools. Nor were the interests of the highest education neglected. The New Zealand University, which is a colonial institution and is empowered by royal charter to confer degrees, undertook the work of examination and of granting degrees. It also established several scholarships. The number of undergraduates on its roll in 1882 was 289. There were also at the same time the Canterbury College at Christchurch, and the Otago University at Dunedin, and (in 1883) the Auckland University at Auck land, all admirable institutions. The establishment of post-office savings banks had also been a signal success. While the population had barely doubled itself from 1871 to 1881, the number of depositors in those banks had increased nearly fivefold. This fact alone is a remarkable indication of the progress of public welfare and of public thrift. There are three other institutions which were erected in 1870, or shortly afterwards, and which, as intimately connected with the social welfare of the colony, deserve attention. They represent great social interests, intimately affecting the welfare of the masses of the community. These institutions are respectively the Government Life Insurance Department, and the Public Trust Office, both of which owe their origin to the statesmanlike foresight of the then Colonial Treasurer, Sir Julius Vogel ; and the land transfer system, which was well known as the"], [195, "GOVERNMENT INSURANCE OFFICE. 177 Torrens' system, established a few years before in Australia. The Government Life Insurance Department was created in 1870. The principles of its functions are to give in surers colonial security, to charge low premiums, and to divide the profits among the policy-holders. The essential difference between the system of government life insur ance undertaken by the General Post-Office in the United Kingdom and the system established in New Zealand is that the latter is not restricted to very small amounts of insurance. The progress of the New Zealand Government Life Insurance Department during the first ten years of its existence is shown by the following extract from the financial statement of the Colonial Treasurer (Major Atkinson) on the 16th of June, 1882 :-\u2014 \" Intimately connected with the subject of the prudential savings of the community are the questions of life assur ance and the growth of the Government Insurance Depart ment. Established in 1870, at a time when public confi dence in many English assurance companies was severely shaken, and with the avowed object of giving to the assured the absolute security of the colony, the depart ment has since exhibited a progressive advancement which warrants the statement that the experiment sanctioned by the Legislature twelve years ago has now been proved a complete success. This scheme may be justly described as the only successful institution of the kind set on foot by any Government ; and the example thus offered has attracted the attention of various other Colonial Govern ments, and also the Indian Government. The premiums were from the first fixed at what were deemed the lowest rates commensurate with a prudent regard to safety, and without any idea of profit-bonuses. But notwithstanding these low charges, careful management, together with the favourable influences of a healthy climate and comfortable social conditions, have produced results more satisfactory than was anticipated. The business of the department in the first ten years of its existence produced a profit of \u00a377,000, as shown by the Valuation Report of the London Actuaries, which was laid before Parliament last session.\" The Public Trust Office was created in New Zealand by an Act passed in 1872. The object of the Act is to insure N"], [196, "178 IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. as much as possible the faithful discharge of trusts, and to relieve persons from being obliged to burden their friends with the responsibilities of trustees. A permanent officer is appointed who can, at the option of those who leave property, be substituted for guardians, and who will ad minister in their place. The charge of intestate estates and the estates of lunatics is also vested in the public trustee. Many owners of property have availed them selves of the Act. The reports of the public trustee pre sented to the Legislature show a satisfactory progress in the working of the office. The Torrens' system of land transfer was established in New Zealand in 1870. The general effect of the system is to enable persons acquiring possession of land by trans fer, inheritance, or other means, to receive a title thereto direct from the Crown. All lands alienated before the system was established can be bought under it, provided there is a clear, or a slightly imperfect, title to it. The system further greatly facilitates the transfer at any time of land once bought under it. The success of the system has been, as in the Australian colonies, an assured fact. Important legislation on a variety of subjects was passed, from 1870 to 1881. \"The Real Estate Descent Act, 1874,\" effects an important change in the former law of succession to real property. On death, undevised land, or land only partially devised, passes to personal representative of person deceased, absolutely if undevised, and subject to partial devise if partially devised. Mortgages, trusts, etc., saved. Personal representative must sell such land, and the proceeds, after payment of expenses, become part of the personal estate of the intestate, and must be dealt with in due course of administration. Persons entitled to proceeds may on certain terms require con veyance of land. In 1880, a Bill was passed to legalise the marriage of a man with the sister of his deceased wife. This Bill was reserved for the signification of her Majesty's pleasure thereon ; and it received the royal assent and became law in New Zealand. Other laws were passed for the protection of the property of married women, regulating the practice of law, the employment of females and others, providing in certain cases for the adoption of children,"], [197, "LIABILITIES AND ASSETS. 179 facilitating the formation of friendly societies and of building societies, and the naturalisation of aliens, and regulating the licensing system in the sale of intoxicating liquor. This last law provides for elective licensing committees to be elected yearly, and admits the principle of local option in the case of new licences. I have before noticed that even in the time of the first Governor, Captain Hobson, in 1840, much of the legislation in New Zealand had an advanced and far-seeing character ; and that feature will, I think, be, from time to time, recognised in subsequent legislation in that colony. So early as in 1850, when Governor Sir George Grey intro duced an extended country municipal council at Auckland, he not only gave a liberal franchise, but, what was novel in those days, assimilated the qualifications for election and for voting. As a remarkable instance among- others I may specify two laws passed in New Zealand in 1858. One was a law substituting private for public executions in cases of capital sentences. This law, I believe, was the first precedent of the kind within the British dominions ; and the example set has been followed in the United Kingdom, and in almost all, if not all, British possessions. The other law was one enabling coroners to hold inquests on the origin of fires, even when no loss of life occurred, in case of any suspicious circumstances. The need of such a law within the United Kingdom is now recognised. There are two other documents bearing on the condition of New Zealand in 1881 and of high authority. One is a paper read before the Royal Colonial Institute in London, in 1882, by Sir Francis Dillon Bell, Agent-General for New Zealand ; and the other is a pamphlet written in 1882 by Mr. Mulhall, F.S.S.- SirTrancis Bell first goes into the question of the liabilities and assets of the colony in 1881. The public debt was \u00a327,630,000, and he estimates the assets at \u00a3103,000,000. These assets are \u2014 freehold farms, \u00a334,000,000; sheep and cattle, \u00a39,000,000 ; houses, \u00a331,000,000; railways, \u00a311,000,000; merchandise, \u00a318,000,000; in all, \u00a3103,000,000. These assets are exclusive of Crown lands. If he had added Crown lands, the assets would be increased in value by several millions, for a map published at the time by the Surveyor-General of New Zealand shows that there were then 12,000,000"], [198, "180 FROZEN MEAT. acres of Crown land leased as pastoral runs, and 11,800,000 acres of Crown land open for selection, in addition to 9,000,000 acres of lakes, mountain tops, and barren country. Sir Francis goes on to state that, in New Zealand, 997 squatters occupied 12,025,000 acres ; that the number of freeholders was 24,080, occupying 4,029,000 acres ; and that the proportion under crops was 65 per cent. He draws special attention \"to the fact that in 1881 New Zealand had 3,500,000 acres laid down to English grasses out of 4,500,000 acres cultivated, which is a much larger proportion than in England and eScotland, where (according to the Agricultural Returns for 1882, just then issued by the Board of Trade) the permanent pasture is 46 per cent, of the cultivated land.\" He adds that these returns show, in reference to wheat, \"that while the average yield for Australasia was 9 bushels, against 10 bushels for all the United States, the yield in New Zealand was 22| bushels to the acre.\" The same paper refers to a rising industry in Australasia, which Sir Francis counts as among the greatest of its resources, namely, the export of frozen meat to the United Kingdom, and gives the following account of the result of the first considerable shipment from New Zealand : \u2014 \" The question was whether the thing could be done at all. There were two problems to be solved : one whether meat in a frozen state could pass through the great heat of the tropics and get here fit for human food ; the other, whether it could be sent here at a profit. Both these questions have been answered in the affirmative. Some months ago, 5000 frozen sbeep came here in one lot from New Zealand. The conditions were rather adverse to success ; the voyage had been prolonged to over ninety days, the heat experienced in the tropics had been ex ceptionally great, and the ship had been becalmed upon the line ; but the very fact of these conditions being so adverse, enabled the freezing process to be thoroug-hly tested. It had been feared that the sheep packed in the lower tiers would be crushed and bruised by the weight of those above, but nothing of the kind occurred. The meat arrived here in such excellent condition that the whole of it was sold within a fortnight. It was taken out of the freezing chamber at night and sent to Smithfield"], [199, "FROZEN MEAT. 181 Market, where it was still hard frozen when the butchers came to buy it in the morning. Such a thing as a cargo of 5000 frozen sheep never having been seen before, it attracted much attention, even the Times speaking of it as a ' prodigious fact.' The meat was readily taken into consumption, and I can speak, from my own experience, of how sweet and good in quality it was. It was proved that it is not of the least consequence how long the meat remains frozen, or what is the outside temperature ; you put it into one freezing chamber 12,000 miles off, and you take it out of another here three months afterwards as sweet and fresh as it was the first day. The first part of the problem had therefore been solved ; it remained to be seen how the money part of it would come out. The gross proceeds for the 5000 frozen sheep came to \u00a37978 ; the charg-es, including freight and insurance, coal, expenses of sending to the markets in London and Glasgow, and sale commissions, to \u00a35793, or a little under 3hd. a pound. The sheep netted 21s. 9cl. apiece, a return eminently satisfactory to their owners, because they would not have sold for more than 12s. in New Zealand. It happened that the meat arrived here at a good time for the shippers, and rather better prices were then obtained than could be expected as a rule ; but, on the other hand, there was a strong prejudice to overcome, there were no regular channels for the sale, no properly constructed cool chambers in which to store the meat and thaw it by degrees, so as to turn it out at its best in quantities suited to the day's demand ; above all, there was undisguised hostility from many of the retail butchers. Nevertheless, it was soon quite clear that as the wholesale price to the salesman had only been a fraction over 6^d. a pound, a very good profit was left to the retailer. It may now, 1 think, be safely said that frozen meat in any quantity can be placed upon the market from the other side of the world at 6d. to 6fyl. a pound, leaving a good profit to the grower. This ought ultimately to make meat cheaper here, or at least prevent the further rise now threatened. Australia and New Zealand can, in fact, export 700,000 tons of meat a year, or 2000 tons a day, which is not much more than you want in England even now, with out reducing even the present capital number of their"], [200, "182 FROZEN MEAT\u2014 SHEEP-FARMING. sheep and cattle ; and we are able to send our sheep to Smithfield with greater ease to-day than the Tweed farmers could theirs a hundred years ago, when meat was selling at Id. a pound in Scotland against lOd. in London. The existence of this immense reserve of food supply at the command of England is already being welcomed, not only by householders, but by statesmen, as it deserves.\" Mr. Mulhall, in his pamphlet, also dwells on the great future importance of this industry. He begins by stating that \" the energy and success of the New Zealand colonists could not be more strikingly displayed than in the fact that they have sent the first cargo of frozen sheep to Great Britain, a cargo of 5000 animals in such admirable condition as to make the Leadenhall butchers open their eyes in astonishment.\" He next considers the meat question in Great Britain, and states that the normal increase of population in the United Kingdom, in spite of emigration, is about 1000 souls daily, while there is no increase in the live stock within its boundaries. During the fourteen years immediately preceding 1882 there bad been added five millions to the population, while the number of food cattle of all kinds had fallen seven millions. He gives statistics which lead him to the expectation that the United Kingdom in 1896 will have a population of forty-two or forty-three millions, and will produce only as much meat as will feed its inhabitants for five months in the year. \" Our importation,\" he adds, \" will then exceed a million tons of meat yearly, the bulk of which must necessarily come from the Australian colonies.\" He demolishes the theory that the consumption of meat per inhabitant must decline in the United King dom as the price advances. He proves by statistics that the rise of price goes hand in hand with an increase of wealth, which increase had been prodigious in Great Britain for the preceding ten or fifteen years, and bade fair to continue. He points out the vital importance, under those circumstances, of new and sufficient sources of meat supply to the United Kingdom. In connection with this subject, Mr. Mulhall refers to sheep- farming in New Zealand. He states that, in 1862, New Zealand had fewer sheep than Lincolnshire, and that in twenty years more,"], [201, "SHEEP-FARMING. 183 from 1882, she will have more than Great Britain if the flocks increase even slowly. He adds : \" Not only have the flocks multiplied ninefold in twenty-one years, but the weight of fleece has doubled, and the export of wool now averages 5s. per sheep. This is 2d. over the general average for Australian fleeces ; but the great superiority of New Zealand sheep is in weight of carcase, some of the frozen flock landed last week ranging from 140 to 165 lb.

The capacity of New Zealand for sheep-raising is apparently eight times greater than the actual amount of its flocks, or area occupied.\" After referring to the rapid progress of New Zealand during- the twelve years from 1870 to 1882, Mr. Mulhall concludes by saying, \"What the colony most invites is that class of English farmers with some capital who have been in late years emigrating to Texas and Virginia, and perhaps meeting with less success than if they had tried their fortunes in the Britain of the southern hemisphere.\" The following extract from a paper by Mr. M. Williams on \" The Chemistry of Cookery,\" published in Knowledge in 1884, shows a scientific and practical view of the good"], [202, "184 QUALITY OF FROZEN MUTTON. quality of the frozen mutton sent from New Zealand to the United Kingdom : \u2014 \u25a0 \" Before leaving the subject of animal food, I may say a few words on the latest, and perhaps the greatest, triumph of science in reference to food supply, i.e. the successful solution of the great problem of preserving fresh meat for an almost indefinite length of time. It has long been known that meat which is frozen remains fresh. The Aberdeen whalers were in the habit of feasting their friends on returning home on joints that were taken out fresh from Aberdeen, and kept frozen during a long- Arctic voyage. In Norway, game is shot at the end of autumn, and kept in a frozen state for consumption during the whole winter and far into the spring. The early attempts to apply the freezing process for the carriage of fresh meat from South America and Australia by using ice, or freezing mixtures of ice and salt, failed, but now all the difficulties are overcome by a simple application of the great principle of the conservation of energy, whereby the burning of coal may be made to produce a degree of cold proportionate to the amount of heat it gives out in burning. Carcases of sheep are thereby frozen to stony hardness immediately they are slaughtered in New- Zealand and Australia, and then packed in close refrige rated cars, carried to the ship, and there stowed in chambers refrigerated by the same means, and thus brought to England in the same state of stony hardness as that originally produced. I dined to-day on one of the legs of a sheep that I bought a week ago, and which was grazing at the Antipodes three months before. I prefer it to any English mutton originally obtainable. The grounds of this preference will be understood when I explain that English farmers, who manufacture mutton as a primary product, kill their sheep as soon as they are full grown, when a year old or less. They cannot afford to feed a sheep for two years longer merely to improve its flavour without adding to its weight. Country gentlemen, who do not care for expense, occasionally regale their friends on a haunch or saddle of three-year-old mutton, as a rare and costly luxury. The Antipodean graziers are wool growers. Until lately, mutton was merely used as a manure, and even now it is but a secondary product. The"], [203, "185 PROGRESS, 1870 TO 1881. wool crop improves year by year until the sheep is three or four years old ; therefore it is not slaughtered until this age is attained, and thus the sheep sent to England are similar to those of the country squire, and such as the English farmer could not send to market under eighteen pence per pound. There is, however, one drawback ; but I have tested it thoroughly, having supplied my own table during the last six months with no other mutton than that from New Zealand, and find it so trifling as to be imper ceptible unless critically looked for. It is simply that, in thawing, a small quantity of the juice of the meat comes out. This is more than compensated by the superior richness and fulness of flavour of the meat itself, which is much darker in colour than young mutton.\" I have dwelt at some length on the change which took place in the colony of New Zealand during the ten years which immediately followed the year 1870, for two reasons : first, because it was during that decade that New Zealand made its greatest progress in colonisation ; secondly, because the policy of large borrowing for purposes of colonisation in New Zealand was then first practically initiated, and has left consequences, of a mixed character and still actually at work, which cannot be disregarded and should be understood. The subject is of a complex nature, and cannot be properly judged by a standard applicable to other conditions. As usual in matters of controversy, extreme views are taken on both sides ; and, as usual also, the truth probably lies about half-way between both \u2022extremes. While, on the one hand, it must be admitted that the burden of debt is very great, and that the policy of seeking relief merely by its further extension would be suicidal ; still, on the other hand, it should be borne in mind that the practical advance which New Zealand has made in industrial wealth is almost unprecedented, and that its resources, in course of development and others as yet inactive, are enormous. Its reserve of material strength is almost immeasurable. What is needed is retrenchment of all unnecessary expenditure, wise administration, and encouragement of settlement and sound progress. The further advance which New Zealand has made from 1881 to 1887 will be seen when I state the condition of the colony at the latter date. At present, I need only say"], [204, "186 RAIL WA YS \u2014 NA TIVES. that the serious defects which from the first heavily handicapped the policy of 1870 were aggravated by the abolition of provincial institutions. It is true that by this abolition centralism of administration was secured ; but the centralism was excessive, and produced waste and political demoralisation. Local bodies, in the shape of county councils, were forced into artificial activity, but they never rightly fulfilled the proper local functions of Provincial Governments. Another fact, apart from this question, also became apparent, namely, that the Colonial Government was not fitted to undertake with efficiency and economy the administration of railways. The pressure to which each Ministry was subject rendered that adminis tration weak and vacillating, and subjected it more to political than to commercial interests. It is quite true that State railways should not be managed exactly like those of joint stock companies. State railways should not look only to direct pecuniary profit, but should also include in their view the indirect benefit of the whole public in the facility of traffic and in the promotion of settlement. Nevertheless, State colonial railways should produce a reasonable direct profit on their cost ; and in all probability would do so, without prejudice to their colonising objects, provided that their administrative management were placed in charge of non-political boards. According to the latest accounts, this view is taken in New Zealand, and is in course of being carried into effect. A few words are necessary to show the progress of the native question. So early as 1867, owing to the efforts of Sir Donald M'Lean, special representation was given to the natives in the New Zealand Parliament ; and at present (1887) there are four elected native members in the House of Bepresentatives, and two, appointed by the Governor, in the Legislative Council. Peace, as I have said, was established in 1870 ; but of course for many years afterwards there were, more or less, risks of the recurrence of war arising from smouldering elements of discord and from serious differences which necessarily, from time to time, cropped up between the two races. The confiscation of native lands was a subject fraught with danger and difficulty. With every wish to do justice, the Government, owing to various causes, failed to face"], [205, "187 CONFISCATED LANDS \u2014 KING COUNTRY. the question with promptitude and prudence. For tech nical reasons a large area of confiscated land was pro claimed on paper. But it was distinctly promised that courts should adjudicate what extent of land should be returned to loyal natives who held tribal interests in the land nominally confiscated, and to rebels who had returned to allegiance. Unfortunately, great delay took place, within some districts, in holding these courts and in their adjudication. Consequently, questions arose which at first could have been easily settled, but which became from postponement more and more complicated and difficult. Moreover, lands which should undoubtedly have been appropriated by the Crown in vindication of law, and used, in the public interests, for the purpose of coloni sation, were hung-, like Mahomet's coffin, in mid-air. This procrastinating- policy naturally gave rise to an impression in the native mind that the Crown had tacitly relinquished all claim to those lands, and accentuated native antipathy to all confiscation, even when it had been followed to its legitimate results. These sinister influences combined in creating two menacing evils of considerable magnitude. One was the sullen isolation, for many years, of a large section of the Waikato natives, known as the King natives, and in'their locking up an extensive terri tory to the southward of the higher waters of the Waipa river. The other evil, which became formidable from 1878 to 1881, was the disaffected and threatening attitude of the natives on the west coast of the North Island between New Plymouth and Wanganui, under the chief Te Whiti. Happily, for the sake of general peace, these two movements were not in themselves actually aggressive, and were not made the cause of aggression on our part. The King Country, as it was called, was a passive, solid obstruction to the progress of settlement within its boun daries, but it was purely a native district, and it was wisely, under its special circumstances, left to itself, and the difficulty which it presented gradually melted away under the disintegrating touch of time. Procrastination had originally, as I think, created the evil ; but in this case, when it had been created, salutary neglect, except by utilising favourable opportunities for wise counsel, was the proper policy. The King natives lost sympiathy with"], [206, "188 TE WHITE cither tribes, and by degrees became weary of isolation. Though reluctantly and not without protest, they have succumbed to surrounding influences. Even now an inar ticulate cry for imperial redress reaches the Colonial Office from King* natives ; but there is no heart in the cry because there is no substance in the complaint. The Maori race cannot now be made a separate nation, either under its own rule, or under that of the British Govern ment. It is a part of the colony of New Zealand, and it has its constitutional share of colonial government. Nor \u25a0can it be truly said to suffer any substantial wrong in that political co-partnership. The second evil, namely, the hostile attitude of west' coast natives under Te Whiti, was at one time fraught with peril as a probable cause of another native war. But, happily, that calamitous result was averted by two causes. One was the singular fana ticism and all-powerful influence of Te Whiti, who pro pounded a new faith, the essence of which was passive resistance. Unarmed men, at his command, took posses sion of Crown and European lands, and quietly, also at his command, allowed themselves to be taken by scores to prison. Even when, at last, Te Whiti himself, sur rounded by his men, was taken prisoner by our armed forces, and when a word or a sign from him would have brought on a bloody collision and another war, his influence, supernatural as it was thought to be by his followers, prevented all resistance. And his imprisonment was a fatal blow to his fanatical rule. He has since his first capture been released, and afterwards, as a ring leader in again attempting to take possession of European land, has been arrested, tried, convicted, and imprisoned. The report, April 29th, 1887, of Mr. W. Rennell, the Native Officer at New Plymouth, states that \" it would be premature to say what effect the lesson Te Whiti has had will produce on his fanatical mind, but there can be no doubt that it has fully shown to the natives the ability and intention of the Government to punish any attempt to disturb the peace of the district, and that no offender is now safe from arrest by the police, no matter where he may shelter himself.\" In a subsequent report, May 26th, 1888, Mr. Rennell writes of Te Whiti's influence as apparently decreasing. The other cause which helped to"], [207, "189 NATIVE LAND, DISPOSAL OF. avert war was that remedy of wrong accompanied coercion of crime. The Government made strenuous and successful efforts to settle on equitable terms the long-outstanding grievances which procrastination had created in con nection with the confiscated territory on the west coast. Another native difficulty was the disposal of native lands. This difficulty began from our first colonisation of New Zealand, and its satisfactory solution has since seemed to be impracticable. The Crown's exclusive right of pre-emption was open to serious misconstruction in the native mind, and was subject to persistent opposition from large bodies of both races. Had the Crown been in possession of adequate funds to purchase all native lands which the owners wished, from time to time, to sell, and which were not required for native use, it might have been possible, and it certainly would have been politic, to maintain at all hazards that pre-emptive right ; but in the absence of available public funds, and in the face of the specious offers made, in the event of a change in the law, by private individuals, it was impossible, without serious risk of native disturbance and without a certainty of grave embarrassment, to continue that restriction. No doubt there were large sections of the native race un willing to dispose of land to the Crown ; but there were other numerous tribes, and some even among those sections, inclined to sell or to lease land to individuals. Then, again, the waiver of the right of pre-emption was pregnant with evils. Systematic colonisation would become im practicable ; speculative purchases and land monopolies would be rife ; and the native race, in all probability, would be practically plundered and impoverished. Modi fications, under which private purchases were allowed, subject to preliminary adjudication by special courts of law, and to the payment by the purchaser to the Crown of substantial fees, were, from time to time, tried with more or less failure. The latest attempt is \" The Native Land Administration Act, 1886,\" which came into force on the 1st of January, 1887. Under this Act, commissioners are appointed by the Crown, and committees, consisting of seven members, are elected from among the native owners of any block when those owners are more than seven ; and in case of a less number of owners a less number on"], [208, "190 NATIVE LAND, DISPOSAL OF. the committee may be \"elected. Should there be no dis sentient owners, the land can be disposed of by sale or lease. In case of there being dissentients, a Native Land Court can make partition of the land in question, giving to each owner desirous of holding his land in severalty such part of the land as it may deem just. The residue of the land shall be partitioned in gross between the owners assenting to and the owners objecting to the disposal of the land. The committee may direct the com missioner how the land, to the disposal of which there is no objection, may be dealt with. Owners of land, or the committee, may dispose of land to the Crown on certain conditions. Certain payments in the case of each private purchase are to be made to the Crown on account of .surveys and laying out of roads. There are other sub sidiary provisions relating to the powers and duties of commissioners and committees. No private person can acquire native land except under the provisions of the Act. It is doubtful whether this Act will solve all the complicated difficulties of the question. In fact, fresh legislation on the subject has already been proposed. I shall take further opportunity of referring to the general condition of the natives when I am on the subject of provincial districts in the North Island, and also in a statistical memorandum (published in the Appendix *) on the present state (1888) of New Zealand. * Appendix C."], [209, "191 PROVINCIAL DISTRICTS \u2014 AUCKLAND.

Brief descriptive sketches of the general features and capabilities of the several provincial districts will, I hope, be of some aid in enabling a general conception to be formed of the whole colony by some knowledge of its con stituent parts. This course of proceeding is the more desirable because each provincial district hjas its own special characteristics and its own distinct individuality. Each has been formed independently, it may be said, of the others, at different times, from different centres, and under different conditions. Some differ widely from each other in climate and in natural aspect. This or that district is better fitted for particular industries, whether pastoral, agricultural, mining, or others. Each community has, more or less, its own set of sympathies, interests, and pursuits. I proceed to give in broad outline some characteristic features of the several provincial districts, taking each in its turn geographically from north to south. In referring to statistical information I do not include Maoris unless specially so stated. Provincial District of Auckland. The provincial district of Auckland comprises nearly the whole northern half of the North Island. The"], [210, "192 POPULA TION \u2014 CLIMA TE \u2014 PR OD UCTS. population of the district was returned in the census of 1886 as 130,379 persons, of whom 70,582 were males, and 59,797 females. The area of the whole district is about 17,000,000 acres. The great proportion of the coast line, indented with numerous harbours and roadsteads, and the extent of internal navigable waters are its striking natural features. North of the city of Auckland, the country is broken, and includes large forests. Southward, the land is generally undulating, and it comprises three large rivers, the Thames, the Waikato, and the Waipa. The Auckland gold-fields are in the Cape Colville peninsula, and between the river Thames and the east coast. The Hot Lakes district is that extensive belt which stretches from Lake Taupo in a north-easterly direction to the Bay of Plenty. On the whole, the provincial district of Auckland is more suitable for commerce and for the industries of timber and agriculture than for pasture. The climate of the district is healthy and pleasant. The mean average of heat for the year is 59'6\u00b0 in the shade ; the yearly rainfall is about 45'306 inches, and the average number of days in a year on which rain falls is 185. Vegetation is prolific and fruits of all kinds, including sub- tropical productions, grow well in the open air. The Phormium tenax, or the New Zealand flax, grows in all parts of the district, but is not peculiar to it. Among the most valuable of many valuable timber trees is the Kauri pine, peculiar to the northern half of the district. Kauri gum is also a special product of the Auckland district. Gold, coal, and other economic minerals \u2014 silver, lead, iron, copper, petroleum, manganese, and others \u2014 exist in considerable quantities. Much has been successfully done in the district to acclimatise vegetable and animal life for industrial and domestic purposes. Sub-tropical fruit trees flourish in the northern part of the district, and the culture of sorghum, of sugar-beet, of tea, of tobacco, of the white mulberry, of silk, and of the cork oak tree has been introduced. The Auckland Acclimatisation Society, like its sister societies in the other provincial districts, has done much useful work. Plants, edible fish, game, and singing-birds have been brought into the country, and are doing well in their new homes. The domestic animals of the old country abound everywhere throughout the district and the whole colony."], [211, "193 CITY OF AUCKLAND\u2014 INSTITUTIONS. The capital of the district, the city of Auckland, is placed on a narrow neck of land on the southern bank of the Waitemata river, between the eastern and western coasts of New Zealand, and it has one of the best harbours in the colony. From the sea and from the neighbouring hills, the city and the surrounding country present a beautiful view. Clusters of houses cover hill and vale; facing the town are the green headlands of the north shore, and the remarkable peaks of Rangitoto ; inland, are seen many other extinct volcanoes, now covered with cultivation ; whilst at sea the spacious gulf of Hauraki, or Thames, is studded with islets. The suburbs, Newton, Ponsonby, Parnell, Remuera, and Eden, encircle the city with houses, gardens, and shrubberies. The city is un rivalled for its commercial position ; it has at its door water communication from both sides of the island ; to the north, the Kaipara and Wairoa rivers, leading almost to the Bay of Islands; to the south, the Waikato, Waipa, and Thames rivers, leading into the heart of the island, give it surpassing facilities for inland commu nication. The population of the borough, according to the census of 1886, was 33,161 persons. The suburbs, Newton and Parnell, numbered respectively 1833 and 4672 persons. The city of Auckland is well supplied with gas and water. Among the notable public buildings there are the Government House, the Postal and Telegraph Offices, the Supreme Court, the Auckland Institute, the Temperance Hall, the Freemasons' Hall, the new Opera House, and the Choral Hall. There is a large free Public Library, to which Sir George Grey, K.C.B., made a generous contribution of his very valuable collection of books and manuscripts ; some of them are very old and rare. The Auckland Institute has a good museum. There are also in Auckland many charitable, industrial, and social institutions, besides numerous places of public wor ship belonging to various denominations. The Auckland University College and several public schools provide for excellent education. The Auckland University College, established in 1883, is affiliated to the New Zealand University, and has a professional staff for classics and English, mathematics, chemistry and experimental physics, natural history, biology and anatomy, and applied science. o"], [212, "194 UNIVERSITY COLLEGE. The latest report, dated March 1st, 1888, states that the number of persons who attended lectures in the college in the year 1887 was 107. The total number of undergraduates whose names are on the college register of that year was 77, namely, 5*4 males and 23 females. In June, 1887, the Council of the college resolved to establish, in connection with the college, a School of Applied Science, of which the curriculum is as follows : \u2014 First year: Mathe matics, elementary physics, chemistry, drawing. Second year : Mechanics, mathematics, geology, drawing. Third year : Engineering, mathematics (advanced), surveying, applied mechanics, instruction in engineer's office. Archi tecture : principles of architecture, surveying, applied mechanics, instruction in architect's office. Mining: mine surveying, mining, metallurgy, experience underground. Surveying: mathematics (advanced), astronomy, survey ing, instruction in surveyor's office. During the first two years of the course all the students do the same work, and their studies are accompanied by the acquisition of practical experience. The special instruction for the School of Applied Science is given by the Professors of Mathematics, Experimental Physics, Chemistry, and Geology, and by the instructor in drawing. Special instruction in elementary science is given by lectures and in laboratories to teachers employed by the Auckland Board of Education and to students of the Auckland Training College. The number of graduates of the New Zealand University having their names on the college books was on the 31st of December, 1887, 22, of whom 9 were ad eundem. Daily and weekly newspapers are published at Auckland. The boroughs of Auckland and of its suburb Parnell are respectively governed in municipal affairs by mayors and councillors elected from time to time by the ratepayers. There are admirable public recreation grounds at Auck land. The Government Domain, about one hundred acres, includes a botanical garden and a cricket-ground ; and the Albert Park, consisting of fifteen acres, is in the centre of the city. The local industries of the city include ship-building, foundries, sash and door and general wood manufactures, rope-works, breweries, sugar\" refinery, flour-mills, fibre"], [213, "195 WAITEMATA HARBOUR. manufacture, meat-preserving, meat-freezing, boot and shoe making, tobacco manufacture, and many others. The telegraph connects Auckland and \u2014 here it may be said once for all \u2014 every town and almost every village, however small, in New Zealand with each other, and, through the submarine cable, with Australia and the whole civilised world. There is a large railway station at Auckland, built on ground reclaimed from the harbour. Waitemata, the harbour of Auckland, is one of the finest harbours in New Zealand. The entrance is two miles broad ; and inside there is space for the whole British navy, and safe anchorage for vessels of all sizes. Opposite the town the harbour has a depth of from seven to nine fathoms, and is a mile and a half broad ; and six miles further up there is a depth of four fathoms. There are two principal wharves, Queen Street Wharf and the Railway Wharf. Queen Street Wharf is 1680 feet long, with a depth, at its end, of 24 feet at low spring tide ; and the Railway Wharf is 1000 feet long, with a depth, similarly, of 14 feet. There is every appliance for loading and discharging cargoes. The Auckland Dry Graving Dock, to the west ward of Queen Street Wharf, is 300 feet long, 42 feet wide on the floor, and with about 15 feet depth of water at high spring tides. The Calliope Graving Dock, on the north shore, was opened in February, 1888. It is the largest dock in the southern hemisphere, and is capacious enough to take in the largest man-of-war and ocean steamer. The port of Auckland is eminent among all the New Zealand ports for the number of sailing vessels and steam vessels belonging to and registered at it, and for its coastal trade. At the end of 1886, the number of sailing vessels belonging to and registered at the port of Auckland was 226, with an aggregate tonnage of 17,128 tons ; and the number of steam vessels so owned and registered was 67, with an aggregate tonnage of 6300 tons. The port of Auckland is a busy scene of navigation. Fine sailing vessels trade with every part of the world; swift and commodious steamers run periodically to other New Zealand ports, to Australia, to Fiji, and to San Francisco; small coasters ply every day to and from outports of the district. Ship and boat building is energetically carried \u25a0on at Auckland."], [214, "196 ISTHMUS OF AUCKLAND. The isthmus of Auckland lies between the waters of Waitemata and the gulf of the Thames on the east coast, and of the Manukau on the west coast, and is about twenty-five miles in length. The settlements of One hunga, Panmure, Otahuhu, Howick, and Drury are on this isthmus. Onehunga, the largest of these, is six miles to the southward of the city of Auckland, with which it is connected by rail. Onehunga borders on the port of Manukau. A long bridge across an arm of the Manukau gives immediate access to the rich agricultural district of Mangarei ; and steamers run regularly between Onehunga and the southern ports of the colony across the Manukau bar, which in moderate weather, and with care, is quite safe. There is also communication by small steamers between Onehunga and rising settlements on the inland shores of the Manukau. Onehunga has a railway wharf, saw-mills, and iron works. Nearly all the land on the isthmus of Auckland is fenced and well cultivated, and the farmers rear pure-bred stock of first-class quality. The land is generally undulating, and is dotted with cones of extinct volcanoes. The view from the top of Mount Eden, the largest of these hills, is extensive and pictur esque. The surrounding landscape is like a beautiful panorama ; villages, homesteads, and cultivation blending with the natural loveliness of the scenery. The agricultural capabilities of the district are great. Good pasture covers the volcanic hills, and there is rich land on the levels. Crops are abundant, and cattle fatten on the grass throughout winter. Little manure is needed for the growth of roots of every kind. The fields are not large, and are fenced by hedges ; and each farm grows its small plantation of trees. To the northward of the isthmus of Auckland there is a peninsula about 200 miles in length, and with an average breadth of about 35 miles, indented on the eastern side by numerous harbours, and interpenetrated on the western side, at Kaipara and at Hokianga, by large estuaries. Much of this district is broken land and heavily timbered ; but, in many parts, cultivation, though costly at first in clearing, is sufficiently profitable. The climate is sub-tropical throughout, and resembles that of the coasts of Southern Europe. There is no doubt that"], [215, "197 NORTHERN PENINSULA. the climate and capabilities of the district will in course of no long time secure the permanent establishment there of important sub-tropical industries. The steep hills, the sheltering valleys, the volcanic soil, the congenial tempera ture, and the neighbourhood of the sea will ensure the luxuriant growth of the olive and the vine. The soil and climate also are favourable to the culture of tobacco. Inland, water communication intersects the district in every direction, and the coast possesses magnificent harbours, such as Waitemata and the Bay of Islands, and large estuaries navigable for ships far inland, such as Kaipara and Hokianga. Something has already been done within the district in the production of grapes, oranges, and lemons, but infinitely more still remains to be done ; and the feasibility and imjDortance of olive culture are worthy of special attention. Russell is the chief town at the Bay of Islands. The population is small. The harbour is one of the finest and most spacious in the colony. A road for wheeled traffic is made between the North Shore at Auckland and the Bay of Islands, and steamers run weekly between Russell and Auckland. Kawakawa is a coal-mining township a few miles to the south-westward of Russell, and is connected with it by railway. The output of coal at Kawakawa during the year 1887 was 35,078 tons. The town of Russell, as may have been gathered by my readers, has its historical traditions. Its site was the landing-place in 1814 of the first mission ; incidents connected with its European inhabitants in 1839 led indirectly to British sovereignty over New Zealand ; in the vicinity of Bussell the treaty of Waitangi was negotiated and first signed. Russell was the first seat of government in New Zealand ; and subsequently it was the scene of the first native disturbances. Helensville, connected with Auckland by a railway 35 miles in length, is a village well situated on the head waters of the Kaipara, and is the scene of considerable \u25a0industry and traffic. It is the link of connection between Auckland and the internal navigable estuaries of Kaipara and Wairoa. These estuaries and their tributaries form, as I have before stated, a magnificent system of natural highway for promoting the settlement and developing the capabili ties of the whole peninsula north of the city of Auckland."], [216, "198 KA WA U \u2014 MANGANUI. There are numerous small islands on the eastern side of this peninsula, but only a few are inhabited. These are Tiritiri, Kawau, and the Great and Little Barrier Islands. Tiritiri is about 16 miles to the northward of Auckland, and is one mile and a half in a north-west and south-east direction. There is a lighthouse on the south-east point, showing a fixed white light, second order dioptric, and in clear weather visible 23 miles. Kawau is eight miles to the north of Tiritiri ; it is four miles in length and about the same in breadth. Its scenery is very picturesque ; and Sir George Grey, K.C.B., twice Governor of New Zealand, has, since it became his property, expended many thousands of pounds in building upon it, and in planting and stocking it with many English and tropical trees, and with valuable animals. The Great Barrier Island is about 50 miles to the north eastward of Auckland, and affords great protection to the Hauraki Gulf from seaward. Its length is 21 miles in a north- north-west and south-south-east direction, and its breadth in the widest part is 10 miles. A range of mountains extend almost uninterruptedly throughout its length; and Mount Hobson, the highest one, rises from the central part of the island to a height of 2130 feet, and is clothed with trees to its summit. There is good pasturage for cattle in the valleys and on the slopes of the hills, and there are several bays and harbours on the western side of the island. The Little Barrier is a small island rising 2400 feet above the sea, and is for the most part inaccessible. I proceed now to say a few words respecting the num bers and condition of the native tribes north of Auckland. In the Manganui district, the most northern one, the number of natives returned in the census of 1886 was 2101, consisting of 1140 males and 961 females. In the Bay of Islands district, the number was 1766, consisting of 961 males and 805 females. In the Hokianga district, the number was 2364, consisting of 1289 males and 1075 females. In the Kaipara and Whangarei districts the number was 1833, consisting of 1094 males and 739* females. My statement of the condition of the natives is based on information contained in the latest yearly reports,"], [217, "199 NATIVES. written in 1887 and 1888 by resident magistrates stationed in the several native districts. These reports were pre sented to the New Zealand Parliament, and are published among the New Zealand Parliamentary Papers of those years. In the districts of Manganui and Hokianga the health of the natives has been very good, and the births have exceeded the deaths. There is, however, great room for improvement in native habits of living and in regard for sanitary precautions. The complete abandonment of communism is essential to the welfare of the race. One hopeful sign is an increasing wish among influential natives to have their titles to land individualised. Culti vation of the soil is more attended to, but the general depression has affected native industries. Timber and Kauri gum, the tw-o stock industries, have been in mode rate demand. Whaling, however, was carried on at the sea-coast with spirit, and shows prospect of progress. The natives in these northern districts are sober, and a thorough appreciation of the evils of intemperance is steadily growing. The districts have been remarkably free from all serious crime, and the native people have been generally well disposed and law abiding. They resort more and more to the magisterial court for redress of their grievances. Appreciation of the advantages of native education is felt, and the excellent opportunities afforded of many schools for native children are taken advantage of, and the support given in the way of attendance is satisfactory. The behaviour of the natives in the district of Kaipara has been, with very few exceptions, quiet, orderly, and loyal. Their chief occupation is cultivation of their lauds and gum-digging. Their general health has been good, but there is great need for more attention to sanitary requirements. There is a slight tendency to decrease among the Kaipara natives. Drunkenness, however, is very rare amongst them, and drinking to excess is diminishing. The native schools are fairly attended, but parents are lax in compelling their children to go to school with regularity. In the district of Whangarei, the natives are in general very orderly and submissive to law. The schools are"], [218, "200 A UCELAND G OLD-FIELDS. fairly attended and show good results. Very few cases of drunkenuess have occurred during the past year, and only two instances of crime (horse-stealing). The chief indus tries are timber and gum, but of late the timber industry has languished. The number of the native population is almost stationary, the births about equalling the deaths. In the district of the Bay of Islands, the natives have been quiet, well-behaved, and loyal. The schools are fairly attended, and the general health of the people is much improved. The chief occupation of the natives consists in cultivation and in gum-digging. Crime has been insignificant. Drunkenness has decreased in a remarkable manner. The Auckland gold-fields are in the districts of Coro mandel and the Thames, between forty and fifty miles to the eastward of the city of Auckland. Steamers con stantly ply between Auckland and the gold-fields. The astonishing wealth of these gold-fields may be gathered from the fact that from 1868 to 1885, both inclusive, the total yield from these gold-fields was 1,554,687 ounces, valued at \u00a35,787,415. The silver exported from the colony (amounting to 497,465 ounces, valued at \u00a3124,721) was chiefly extracted from the gold obtained at the Thames, which is alloyed with about 30 per cent, of silver. Other minerals besides gold and silver have been discovered throughout the large peninsula in which the Auckland gold-fields are situated. Mercury, lead, tin, copper, anti mony, cinnabar, zinc, manganese, and iron (which in the form of hematite is used in the manufacture of paint, and as a flux for smelting ores) have been found at the Thames. Antimony, arsenic, and coal have been found at Coromandel ; mercury, iron, copper, and coal, at Ohine muri; mercury, iron, copper, antimony, zinc, tellurium (in conjunction with gold and silver), and manganese, at Te Aroha. The total population, in 1886, within the Auckland gold-fields was 11,974 in number, consisting of 6600 males and 5374 females. The approximate value of machinery employed in quartz-mining at the Auck land gold-fields during the year ending March 31st, 1888, was \u00a3160,500 ; and the approximate cost of water-races, etc., in use there during the same time was \u00a389,848. The price of gold obtained at the Auckland gold-fields"], [219, "201 A UC'KLA ND G OLD-FIELDS. ranges, owing to the considerable alloy of silver, from \u00a32 10s. to \u00a33 Is. 6<i. per ounce, or thereabouts, while in other gold-fields in New Zealand the price, owing to the purer state of the gold, ranges from \u00a33 10s. to \u00a33 17s. per ounce. The quantity of gold obtained at the Auckland gold-fields, and entered for exportation during the year ending March 31st, 1888, was 31,986 ounces, valued at \u00a3126,723. Mr. N. W. Northcroft, warden of the Auckland gold-fields, in his yearly report, dated May 10th, 1888, states that \" altogether the outlook for the future is most encouraging, and, as a consequence of the revived confidence in the prosperity of the district, prospecting is being carried on through out the peninsula with vigour, and several new finds have already been reported from various localities.\" He adds that \" in dealing with the present condition and future prospects of this district, the question of proper appliances and processes for treating the various ores found in it becomes a most important consideration. That the future prosperity,\" he continues, \" of these gold fields will depend largely on the means afforded for the reduction of our ores is beyond doubt. That a great loss has been sustained for many years by the inadequate machinery employed for this purpose has been abun dantly proved by repeated assays from ores from all parts of the district ; and a practical demonstration of the truth of these tests was afforded by the La Monte furnace, during the short time it was in operation, where quartz, which would not pay to treat by the usual battery process, yielded from \u00a310 to \u00a380 per ton. This furnace,\" he goes on to say, \" though it did not prove a success in economically dealing with the refractory ores of this district, produced, at least, one beneficial result. It drew forcible attention to the waste that has been going on for years, and the possibility of adopting a process by which the productiveness of the district might be almost inde finitely enlarged, and lead the way to the newer processes which are now being introduced.\" A branch railway, connecting the Auckland gold-fields and the Thames Valley with the Great Southern Railway at Hamilton, on the Waikato, is in course of construction. The whole length of this branch railway will be sixty-two"], [220, "202 RIVERS WAIKATO AND WAIPA. miles, of which half the distance from Hamilton to Aroha, on the Upper Thames, is open for traffic' At Aroha, there are thermal springs which have been reserved as public baths, and which have been much resorted to since this railway was opened. Southward, beyond the isthmus of Auckland, the pro vincial district widens out, until in the central portion of the island it reaches to a breadth of more than two hun dred miles. The distance from the city of Auckland to the south-eastern limit of the district is about the same. The central interior of this territory is watered for three hundred miles, taking into account the windings, by the rivers Waikato and Waipa. The Waikato, \u25a0 the largest river in the colony, rises in the volcanic mountains Tongariro and Ruapehu, 7500 feet and 9195 feet high respectively, situated in the provincial district of Wel lington. About thirty -five miles from its source the river is lost in a fresh-water lake, twenty-five miles long, Lake Taupo, within the provincial district of Auckland, and emerges on the southern side of the lake, 1250 feet above the sea-level. It flows for some miles along the Kaingaroa plain, an almost level and as yet bare and uncultivated tract of land, of light quality, sloping to the eastward, but which would probably grow good grass. For many miles along this upper course of the river the country is of volcanic origin, and belongs to the natives. The river enters settled European country about a hundred miles south of Auckland city, and is joined soon afterwards, at Ngaruawahia, or Newcastle, by the Waipa. The Waikato thence runs to Mercer, forty-three miles south of Auck land, and, taking a bend westward, flows into the sea on the west coast, about twenty miles south of Manukau Heads. The Waipa river is navigable for smals craft from its junction with the Waikato to Alexandra, a post town 105 miles south of Auckland. Between the two rivers there is level country, much of which is swampy, but reclaimable by drainage. The Lower Waikato country is poor and swampy. A few miles below Ngaruawahia, or Newcastle, coal mines are at work. The coal produced is good for steam and household purposes. The output of coal from these mines during 1887 was 48,367 tons. Ten miles higher up the"], [221, "203 AGRICULTURE. Waikato is the town of Hamilton, the population of which in 1886 numbered 1201 persons. There are fine farms round Hamilton, and it is the converging point of railway and road communication with the Upper Thames, east and west coast, and other districts. Higher up, about fourteen miles, lies Cambridge, the population of which in 1886 was 1019. The land in the Upper Waikato and Waipa districts is of much better quality, and has been extensively cultivated. The following extracts from a report contained in a pamphlet published by Messrs. G. Street and Co., 30, Comhill, London, E.C., of a visit to New Zealand in 1880 of Messrs. S. Grant and J. S. Foster, delegates to the colony from the tenant farmers of Lincolnshire, are interesting and useful, as the view of competent and im partial observers on the agricultural condition and pros pects of the Waikato district : \u2014 \" Much of the land is high and dry, formed of a rich alluvial deposit, and in its native state is covered with Tea-tree, a sort of low shrub, or more often with fern re sembling our bracken. The Tea-tree sometimes grows to the size of a small tree, and is then called 'manuka.' It is cleared by burning and cutting down, and is useful for making fences : if of sufficient size, it may be of consider able value for that purpose. The fern is much more easily cleared to start with, but requires considerable care afterwards to keep it down. It is burnt off about the month of February, and, on a good piece of land, grass seeds and clover may be simply sown in the ashes, and will in about three or four months fatten a bullock to the acre. This enables a profit to be got quickly from the land, but the grass from this sowing will begin to fail in about three or four years, and will have to be gradually renewed by ploughing and re-sowing. No manure whatever is required, and about six to nine pounds of clover seeds, from what we were told, seemed to be about the amount of seed generally used per acre. The time seems very short for such a result, but farmers everywhere assured us that it was sufficient, and we saw many fine fields of grass which we were told had only been sown for about that period. Clover grows every where with astonishing rapidity, and possesses fattening"], [222, "204 AGRICULTURE. properties quite different from our clovers at home, and \u2022due, we believe, almost entirely to the superiority of the climate. It grows nearly all the year round ; the cattle are never housed in the winter, and never receive any artificial food. It will keep a great amount of stock ; some fields would fatten a bullock and a half to the acre all summer, and almost one in winter.\" ...\" After clearing off the fern, cattle alone ought to be kept for some years ; they will eat down the youug fern, which sheep fail to do ; and land stocked at once with the latter only will soon return almost to its original state. Immense crops of turnips, carrots, potatoes, or any kind of root can he grown without any artificial manure whatever. The first were young at the time of our visit, but crops of the two latter were shown to us equal to, if not surpassing, any thing that we have seen at home after the most careful cultivation. Turnips are nearly always sown broadcast, sometimes mixed with grass seed, and left to their chance without any hoeing or singling-, and it certainly seems wonderful that such a process is in general followed by such results.\" . . . \"As to the grow-th of cereals on the Waikato, we cannot speak with so much confidence. The country is yet too new for the experiment to have been properly tried. But there seems no doubt that the fern land is not fit for the production of wheat until it has been grazed for probably eight or ten years. For a foot \u2022or more below the surface the soil is a mass of fern-root, which, possibly on account of the tannin it contains, makes the land ' sour,' and until this is thoroughly de composed, and the ground consolidated by cattle-grazing, corn cannot be grown to advantage.\" ...\" We pass to the swamp lands, or, as we should call them, the fens of the Waikato. These were formed in many cases by the Maoris for the sake of eel fisheries, by blocking up the natural outlets for the drainage of the low countries. They are generally covered with New Zealand flax and raupo, a kind of broad reed like a bulrush, or ' rushes,' but the flax and raupo swamps are considered to be the best land. Many of them in their natural state are perfectly im passable, either on horseback or foot, but they are drained without much difficulty, if a proper system of drainage is \u2022made over a large area ; and the land then presents much"], [223, "205 A GRICUL TURE \u2014 S TO CK. of the same appearance as, and has many of the qualities of, our best fen lands at home. As the water runs off, the land usually subsides several feet, and the drains have to be deepened while this continues. An open drain will usually suffice for from fourteen to fifteen chains on either side, according to the nature of the subsoil. Under drains are only required to tap any particular spring which may be found. When drained, the flax or other growth is burnt off in the dry weather ; grass seeds and clover are sown down in the ashes, or, if it is not too rough, the plough may be run through it, and the land is then soon ready for cattle, which do much good by treading down and consolidating the soil. Swamp land varies much in quality. If good, it is some of the best land in the country ; clover grows on it with wonderful luxuriance, as also very heavy crops of all kinds of roots, and it will, no doubt, produce good crops of corn in due time. Other swamps are covered with a thick layer of peat, or are full of old logs and tree roots, which make them difficult to drain and impossible to plough. We doubt very much whether they will, at any rate for some time, repay the expense and trouble of cultivation, but even here the coarser kinds of grass grow well; timothy seems a great favourite, and it is no unusual thing to see the heads of this grass from ten to fourteen inches long.\" ... \" We were very much pleased with the general appear ance of stock in this district. Though not on the whole a great sheep-breeding country, Lincolns and Leicesters are on some farms produced in considerable numbers, and all that we saw were well bred and in good condition.\" . . . \"As might be expected, many details of farming vary much from those to which we have been accustomed. One of the greatest and most pleasant differences is the absence of any need for artificial manure. Luxuriant crops of roots and clover can be grown without it, though it is not denied that a little guano, or dissolved bones, may sometimes be of service to the former. Artificial food, too, is unknown : there are no linseed cake bills there. The cattle fatten ready for the market on turnips and grass only.\" ...\" The ploughing, which in the first in stance is usually about four inches deep, is always done"], [224, "206 RAIL WA Y \u2014 TA URANGA. with double furrow ploughs, and is very often, especially on large estates, let by contract.\" The railway from Auckland to Te Awamutu, 100 miles, goes through the heart of this district. And here a word or two on railway travelling in New Zealand may not be out of place. The gauge is narrow, 3 ft. 6 in. The carriages are made on the American principle, with seats on each side, and a passage down the centre to doors at each end, outside of which there is an open plat form. Railway guards can go through the whole length of the train when they please. The stations are small and numerous, and at intervals refreshments are obtainable. The ordinary speed, including stoppages, is about fifteen miles an hour, and in express trains between twenty and twenty-five miles an hour. There are two classes, and both have comfortable seats. The fares for the first class are a fraction over 2d. a mile, and for the second class lij(7. a mile ; there is a reduction of about 33 per cent, for return fares. The average rate of the cost of working the traffic of goods per ton per mile for five chief lines in 1886-87 was in pence as follows : \u2014 Auckland, 2'60tZ. ; Napier, 2*06<J. ; Wellington, 2'87d. ; Wanganui, 4*33(1 ; and Hurunui Bluff, 2'59d. The total average was 2'68cZ. The Great Southern Railway from Auckland now (1888) extends 25 miles beyond Te Awamutu, and it is in course of further extension to its intended junction with the Northern Railway from Wellington, so as to complete one great main line between the cities of Auckland and Wellington. Tauranga is a port in the Bay of Plenty of considerable importance, as it is the only harbour on the east coast between Mercury Bay and Wellington that affords shelter in all winds for vessels of burthen. The entrance to the harbour is through a rather tortuous course, but inside there is a safe and commodious anchorage for a fleet. The population of Tauranga, which is a municipal borough, was, in 1886, 1148 persons. Tauranga has steam com munication twice a week with Auckland, and coaches run to and from Napier twice a week, by way of Lakes Rotorua and Taupo. The time taken each way is three days. There is good wharf accommodation in Tauranga."], [225, "207 HOT LAKES. The sill-rounding land is suitable for agriculture and pasture. The local industries include ship and boat building, brewing, fish-curing, and flour-mill. White Island, an active volcano, lies off Tauranga, twenty-eight miles from the shore. It is about three miles in circum ference aud 860 feet high ; the base of the crater is one mile and a half in circuit and level with the sea ; in the centre is a boiling spring about 100 yards in circum ference, and sending volumes of steam 2000 feet high in calm weather. The great product of the island is pure sulphur. This island is the eastern limit of that extensive belt of subterranean agitation which extends from Mount Egmont through Tongariro, the Taupo, and Rotorua lakes to Whale Island and the adjacent rocks, north of which line earthquakes are rarely felt. The chief natural feature near Tauranga is the site of the Hot Lakes, which have been aptly termed \" Wonder land.\" The two terraces at Rotomahana, the marvellous beauties of which have been so often described, were totally destroyed by the eruption which took place at Tarawera on the 10th of June, 1886. Government had in 1881, in pursuance of special powers granted by the Colonial Parliament, taken steps to establish a sanatorium and baths in the Hot Lakes district, in order to make available the wonderful curative properties of the mineral springs in the vicinity of Lake Rotorua. It is most fortunate that the late eruption has not frustrated the action and the object of this beneficent course. Mr. J. McKerrow, the Surveyor- General of New Zealand, in his annual report on the Crown Lands Department for the year ending March 31st, 1887, states that he believes the diminution, effected by the volcanic outburst, in the number of visitors and of baths taken, was only temporary. He writes that there are still great attractions for the invalid and tourist at Rotorua, and that \"the time is not far distant when the grand tour of the North Island will be through the volcanic zone, taking in turn Te Aroha, Rotorua, the sinter terraces of Waiotapu Valley and of Orakei-Korako on the Waikato, which recall \u2014 the latter more especially \u2014 the memory of the beauty of the famous White Terrace of Rotomahana ; the Alum Cave at Orakei- Korako ; the geysers at Wairakei ; the Huka Falls ;"], [226, "208 SANATORIUM HOSPITAL.

In his latest report (June, 1888), he states that the number of tourists, and of baths taken, has increased. With respect to the Rotorua Sanatorium Hospital, Dr. Macgregor, the Inspector-General of Hospitals in New Zealand, w-rites in his annual report of 1887 as follows: \u2014 \" The marvels of Sulphur Point Reserve, on which this hospital is situated, have been so often reported on, that I can confine myself at present to the simple statement that the marvellous advantages of this sanatorium have not been diminished in any way by the late volcanic out burst.\" ...\" The marvellous resources of this place, if only they were properly advertised, and access by rail provided, would cause sufferers to congregate from all parts of the world in such numbers as would astonish the most sang-uine believers in its future. I believe there is nothing in the world to compare with this as a city of refuge for persons who suffer from rheumatism, which is not gone to the length of organic changes in the joints ; from neuralgias ; from chronic congestions of such viscera as the uterus, liver, and kidneys ; from functional paralyses generally ; and from skin-diseases of all kinds. I make these state ments on the authority of Dr. Ginders, the able and painstaking resident medical officer, who also informs me that in most cases of lung affections it is useless, if not"], [227, ""], [228, ""], [229, "209 SANATORIUM HOSPITAL. positively injurious, to send people here. It ought not to be forgotten in this connection that the Government has not been able to do anything more than make two or three springs available out of the dozens that are running to waste in this wonderful locality. The various mud springs all over the place would of themselves be simply invaluable for thousands of despairing sufferers from* gouty and rheumatic affections and skin-diseases, who, if they knew* their properties, would hasten from the ends of the earth to take advantage of them.\" Dr. Macgregor adds : \" The Blue Bath, recently opened, is a great addition to the attractions of the sanatorium. It is a tank of concrete, 62 feet by 23 feet, with suitable rooms on three sides of it, containing all necessary conveniences, shower-bath, etc. It contains 32,000 gallons of water from the Omawhata or Chameleon Spring. A great feature of the bath is the sulphur vapour-bath, supplied by a cavity which was broken into during the excavations. The composition of the vapour is 2SH -f- S02 = 3S 4- 2H\u201e0. The galvanic room is elaborately fitted with the most modern electrical apparatus, a Davy's constant-current battery, with fifty sulphate of mercury cells, a Weiss's Faradic battery, with Radcliff's positive-charge electrodes of every kind.\" A Government railway will soon connect Rotorua with Auckland. A branch line from Morrinsville, on the Waikato-Thames Railway, to Rotorua is in course of con struction. The total length of this branch line will be 73 miles, of which 41 miles are open for traffic, and the remaining work is in progress. Mr. S. Percy Smith, F.R.G.S., Assistant Surveyor- General in New Zealand, was despatched in 1886 to Rotorua by the Government for the purpose of reporting on the volcanic eruption, and his elaborate and able report has been published, together with explanatory maps and drawings, by authority, in the form of a pamphlet. I append some extracts from this report, and two plans, drawn by Mr. Percy Smith, which accompanied his report on the Taupo volcanic zone. \" A reference to Map No. 1, accompanying this report, will show how large a part of the central regions of the North Island of New Zealand is occupied by the volcanic p"], [230, "210 TAUPO VOLCANIC ZONE. rocks of the Taupo zone. Included in that term are rocks of various compositions, but all belonging to the acidic elass, consisting of trachytes, rhyolites, obsidian, pumice, and the various tufas, breccias, and agglomerates derived from them, all of which belong to the younger volcanic series of Von Hochstetter. They are of Tertiary age, dating from the Eocene period, when volcanic activity seems first to have commenced in this district. And this activity has continued with varying intensity down to the present time. In the area shown on the map (4275 square miles) none but volcanic rocks or their derivatives are to be found, and if the rocks of the same character which have been derived from this source are added, we shall find more or less volcanic matter scattered over a country nearly as large again. Within the district will be found types of volcanic action of all kinds ; active and distinct craters, immense lava-flows, enormous deposits of pumice, vast areas of volcanic mud and sands, solfataras, fumaroles, mud-volcanoes, hot springs, lakes and rivers, healing waters of various descriptions, geysers, natural hot baths and sinter terraces, combining to make this one of the most attractive portions of the earth, either for its natural wonders or for the picturesque beauty there displayed. To enumerate all the points of interest within this area would be beyond the scope of this paper; but some refer ence to a few of the most prominent is necessary to an understanding of their general character and relation to the recent occurrences.\" \" It will be observed that the longer axis of this volcanic zone has a direction nearly north-east and south-west, and, if we continue it in the former direction, we shall find that the islands off the coast belong to the same volcanic series. White Island is an active volcano, though now in the solfatara stage, its crater, half a mile in diameter, being filled by a lake but a few feet above sea-level, the water of which is warm, while along its edges arise high into the air columns of steam, which may be seen for a hundred miles round, and which deposits sulphur and other minerals in the fissures of the rocks through which it passes. Whale Island has hot springs on it, and 'on the adjacent Rurima rocks steam can occasionally be seen issuing from the ground. To the north-west, Mayor"], [231, "211 TAUPO VOLCANIC ZONE. Island has one of the largest extinct craters in the district, the steep inside walls of which glisten with black shining obsidian in immense quantities ; but even here the volcanic forces are not yet extinct, for hot springs are found on the eastern side of the island, near high-water mark. A line drawn from White Island south-westerly through Ngauruhoe will indicate very nearly the line of greatest activity of thermal action of this district, the principal springs, etc., being situated either on or but a short distance from this line, and it will terminate on the summit of Ruapehu, 8878 feet high, the highest mountain of the North Island, and which has lately proved to be in a state of activity, though hitherto always considered to be extinct. And if we pursue our inquiries back to a period preceding the present one of thermal activity, we shall find that extinct, but generally perfect, craters are to be found on several cones along this same line ; whilst in the other parts of the district, though signs of former activity are everywhere present, no such craters are to be seen. Immediately to the north of the active mountain, Ngauruhoe, 7481 feet high, are situated the remains of the magnificent cone of Tongariro, a name which is usually applied to its more active neighbour, 6500 feet high, on the summit of which are found six craters of different ages, two of which, however, may still be said to have some life left in them, for they emit a little steam from the fissured sides; whilst on the north- west, a few hundred feet below the crater-rim, are some very active hot and sulphurous springs, called ' Ketetehi ' and ' Te Mari,' showing by their presence that the volcanic fires are still smouldering beneath the mountain. Standing but a short distance off on either side of this central line, and just a little to the south of Lake Taupo, are Kakaramea, 4258 feet, and Pihanga, about the same height, near the summits of both of which traces of craters can be seen, whilst at the foot of the former a group of hot springs, lately visited by District- Surveyor Cressen, the first European to see them, denotes the presence of volcanic heat at no great depth.\" . . . \" Passing to the north of Lake Taupo we find Mount Tauhara, 3603 feet high, a fine conical hill, with crater on top now extinct, and clothed at the bottom and western"], [232, "212 TAUPO VOLCANIC ZONE. side with a forest of fine trees. The crater-rim is very perfect on the north, east, and south sides, but the western, that directed towards the prevalent wind, has broken away. At its base, on the shores of Taupo and along the Waikato river on both sides for some miles down, are found innumerable hot springs and geysers, all in a state of great activity, indicating the close proximity to the surface of the heated matter below. From Tauhara north wards, the next cone with an extinct crater is situated at a distance of fifty-one miles from it. Mount Edgecombe, or Putuauki, 2945 feet high, has on its top two craters, one of which contains a small lake, and the sides of both of which are clad with forests of very old growth. The mountain itself is a most regular cone, rising out of the plain with steep curved slopes, and without the presence of any neighbouring hills to detract from its symmetrical shape. At its base is a group of hot springs, again show ing that the forces which elevated it have simply trans ferred their locus to a point where they more easily find a vent, and proving that they have not died out altogether. Finally, at a distance of sixty-three miles in a north-north west direction, is situated the extinct crater of Mayor Island, or Tuhua, already alluded to, the highest point of which is 1274 feet above sea-level.\" Mr. Percy Smith further draws attention to the facts that along the same axial line from Ruapehu to White Island the greatest thermal activity prevails ; and that the same line, very little varied from a strictly lineal direction into a slightly sinuous one, follows well-marked features in the physiography of the country, such as river valleys, low plains, lake margins, and the comparatively low watershed between Rotomahana and the Waiotapu ; and, further, that along this somewhat sinuous line running water in considerable volume is found everywhere but on that watershed. He infers from these facts that along this line a fissure underground exists, up which the lave welling up, in order to escape the pressure of incumbent strata, comes into contact with water from the rivers per colating through crevasses, and gives rise to the thermal phenomena exhibited. The recent eruption, he adds, though it deviated somewhat, but to no great extent, from the general direction, was on the line of this fissure He"], [233, "VOLCANIC ERUPTION. 213 is of opinion that this fissure is deep-seated and intimately connected with the larger and more general lines on which the two islands are built up, because it is parallel to the great mountain-backbones of both islands. This fissure may be, he thinks, as ancient as the volcanic region itself, and possibly is the same from which came the first signs of activity in Eocene times, when it was probably sub marine. From inquiries which Mr. Smith made among the natives, their traditions indicate that long ago the hydro thermal action within the Taupo zone was more active and on a grander scale. Even within the memory of those living, geysers had ceased to play, temperature had sunk, and the activity on the whole had seemed to have decreased. So much so that a sense of security had been strengthened among the inhabitants of the district, and for generations past the natives had selected their villages in the immediate neighbourhood of the boiling waters, tempted thereto by the increased facilities for cooking operations, the additional warmth, and the attrac tion of ever-warm baths. Even European settlement was coming close to some of the famous hot springs, and had it not been for the accident of difficulties arising from the Maori titles many more Europeans would have occupied the district. As it was, the far-famed terraces of Rotomahana were yearly attracting crowds of visitors ; and it is a matter of thankfulness that the eruption occurred when the visitors had nearly all left the district. Premonitory signs, though not understood, were not, how ever, wanting. Thermal activity had for some months previously to the eruption increased, lake-waves had been observed, and an unusual eruption of mud at the Pink Terrace had taken place. The destruction of human life when the catastrophe took place was almost wholly among the natives. The number of the victims of both races was 111. As an instance of the utter unconsciousness of apprehended danger, Mr. Smith states that Rangihena, an old native chief, had, a few days previously to the 10th of June, removed with ten or twelve members of his tribe to two little islets in the middle of Lake Rotomahana, for the sake of sanatory bathing. Those unfortunate men must have been the first witnesses and the first"], [234, "214 VOLCANIC ERUPTION. victims of the catastrophe on that terrible night. Instan taneously those islets and the quiet little lake became the raging crater of a volcano. Rotomahana (Warm Lake) occupied nearly the lowest position on the central axis of the volcanic zone ; its height above the sea-level was 1080 feet, and its area was 185 acres. All its water was warm, but of varying temperature \u2014 in some places little more than tepid, and in others nearly boiling. Around its shores steam escaped from innumerable hot and boiling springs, fumaroles, and solfataras, more particularly so at the northern end, close to the celebrated White Terraces. On the western shore, the Pink Terraces, almost equally beautiful, were surrounded by hot springs and fumaroles. The sedgy margins of the lake gave shelter to large numbers of duck, teal, and other aquatic birds, attracted by the warmth of the water and strictly preserved by the Maori owners of the district. Several streams of cold water flowed into the lake, bringing down the drainage of a watershed of thirty-six square miles. The outlet was from the northern end, where a strong stream of hot water, after a course of a mile and a descent of forty feet, fell into Lake Tarawera. The source of the stream had often been a matter of doubt, as the small amount of water running overground into the lake was insufficient to account for it ; but Mr. Smith is of opinion that the eruption has disclosed the fact that the supply was mainly underground. Tarawera Mountain stands immediately to the east of, and about two miles from Tarawera Lake. The mean height of the plateaus of the mountains of Wairanga, Ruawahia, and Tarawera is about 3500 feet above the sea-level, and about 2500 feet above the lake ; the area on the top is three square miles. I quote the account of the eruption from part of Mr. Percy Smith's pamphlet : \u2014 \" The description of the phenomena observed at the actual eruption is taken by permission from a paper read before the Auckland Institute by Messrs. S. Percy Smith and J. A. Pond, on the 12th of July (1886), with some additions and alterations derived from subsequent inquiries by the writer. \" The best account obtainable seems to place the first"], [235, "215 VOLCANIC ERUPTION. sign of anything extraordinary being at hand at about 1 a.m. on Thursday, the 10th of June, 1886, when slight earthquake shocks were felt by the people of the Wairoa, a village situated just eight miles from, and nearly due west of Mount Tarawera ; and also by those of Rotorua, accompanied at the latter place by rumbling noises, which appear to have been continued with varying degrees of intensity up to 2 a.m. or past. At 2.10, or 2.20, the rumbling noise had increased to a continuous and fearful roar, and at that time was accompanied by a heavy shock of earthquake. At the same time, or immediately afterwards, an enormous cloud of smoke and vapour was observed from the Wairoa, rising over the hills which shut in that village from a clear view towards Tarawera, the outside edges and margins of the different masses of which were outlined by vivid flashes of electricity darting through the cloud, and colouring it most brilliantly and beautifully. This electric display was accompanied by repeated claps of loud thunder, and by a rustling, or crackling, noise which appears to have been distinctly heard above the deafening roar, and which is probably the same as that heard in electric discharges of an artificial kind, and also in auroral displays. The heavy shock of earthquake is, doubtless, the same as that reported at Maketu at 2.30, Tauranga at 2, Whakarewarewa at 2.30, Opotiki at 2, and Oropi at 2.30 a.m. ; the differences of time being due to local inaccuracies of clocks. It was noted by two ob servers, Messrs. Blythe and Greenlees, that from 2.30 onwards severe shocks occurred at regular ten-minute intervals up to 3.30 ; and it was between these hours that the outburst at Rotomahana occurred, for Mr. Blythe noticed that the white cloud of steam arising therefrom was first seen about 2.30, that from Tarawera being black by contrast. It is proved by several witnesses that the eruption of Tarawera took place first ; and Mr. M'Rae, of the Wairoa, who witnessed the scene, shortly after the first outburst from the old mission house, believes this to have been shortly before two o'clock. As seen by himself and others, this consisted of three columns of smoke and fire, probably the glare reflected on the vapour from the heated lava below, shooting up into air from the flat platform-like summit of the mountain to an immense height, with flashes"], [236, "216 VOLCANIC ERUPTION. of electricity darting forth in all directions, accompanied by balls of fire, some of which fell at great distances, whilst others appeared to roll slowly down the steep sides of the hill towards the lake. Small stones now began to fall at the Wairoa and at Kaiteriria, as the great black cloud which had rapidly formed over the mountain worked its way tow-ards the west, to be quickly followed by a downpour of mud and water and occasionally heavier stones, some of which were hot, which battered down some of the houses in the village, and in other cases lodged in the thatched roofs. The mud appears to have fallen in the form of an exceedingly heavy rain, with occasional large lumps; and this continued up to 6 a.m. During this downpour, stones of various sizes continued to fall, en dangering the lives of those who ventured out of the houses ; and, as the stones proved to be of the same scoria ceous nature as those found on top of the mountain, they must have come from there, although the mud, doubtless, came from Rotomahana and the fissure in which Rotoma kariri Lake was formerly situated. All this time there appears to have been a more or less strong odour of sul phurous and other gases experienced by the people of Wairoa ; and Mr. Blythe describes a hot suffocating blast which nearly choked himself, Mr. Lundins, and Miss Haszard, after their escape from the burning houses, and which warmed them through, a welcome change from the bitter piercing cold which appears to have prevailed the whole time. \" Soon after the commencements of the eruption, and before the fall of the first stones, a great wind rose, which rushed down the valley of the Wairoa towards the erup tion, and which branched off by Tikitapu Lake, rushing up the funnel-shaped valley there, prostrating the beautiful forest, and utterly destroying it. It is noticeable that the people who survived and were nearest to the seat of erup tion, viz. those at the Wairoa, failed to hear the loud detonations which reached Auckland and other places ; possibly the loud and continuous roar drowned the other reports by interference. These explosions were heard at Hamilton, Cambridge, Coromandel, Te Aroha, Taupo, Christchurch, Nelson, Blenheim, Auckland, New Plymouth, Helensville, Whangarei, Waiapu, and Wellington, and in"], [237, "217 VOLCANIC ERUPTION. a much less degree at places on the Bay of Plenty coast. They sounded like the report of distant cannon, or, as has been described by a large number of people, like the noise caused by blows on an iron tank. A considerable disturb ance of the atmosphere was noticed in Auckland in the form of vibrations of the air. After each report the windows of the houses rattled and shook as much as they would have done from a slight earthquake shock. The flashes of the electric display also were distinctly seen there, a distance of 120 miles in a straight line from Tarawera. It must have been on the grandest scale. The vast cloud appears to have been highly charged with light ning, flashing and darting across and through it, some times shooting upwards in long curved streams, at others, following horizontal or downward directions, frequently ending in balls of, fire, which as often burst into thou sands of rocket-like stars. Fire-balls fell at the Wairoa and other places. Doubtless the streams of lava re ported as having been seen coursing down the sides of Tarawera were some of these slowly rolling along the sur face, or appearing to do so from the point of observation. Mr. Blythe describes some of them as moving horizontally along the edge of Lake Tarawera, just under the mountain, in such a manner as to give rise to the belief that they were lights in the boats from Te Ariki. Wbilst sheltering in the verandah of Mr. Haszard's house he saw a large ball of fire fall on the roof and slowly roll over to the ground, and there disappear. In all probability Mr. Haszard's house was set on fire either by one of these or by the lightning, as was also the forest on the north side of Lake Tarawera, wbich was burning a few days after the eruption in several places. The immense cloud of ashes and dust which was shot high up into the air, driven by the south-easterly wind in a westerly course, and then by the south-west wind in a northerly and easterly direction, quenched the bright moonlight, and darkened the sky for hours after daylight should have appeared. The Cim merian darkness was such as 'could be felt.' Charged with its burden of ash, dust, and sand, it gradually spread from the point of eruption, one edge of it taking a north westerly direction, the other nearly east, until it passed out to sea, dropping as it went its load of matter all over an"], [238, "218 VOLCANIC ERUPTION. extent of country covering 5700 square miles of land, the extreme eastern being at Anaura, which is a few miles north of Gisborne, \u2014 points 160 miles apart. All over this area more or less fine ash, dust, sand, or scoria can be found, de creasing in quantity as the focus is left, the extreme edges being so lightly covered that the deposit disappeared with the first rain. The height to which this dust-laden cloud and its accompanying brilliant electric discharges reached was enormous. It was clearly seen from Auckland by several people, one of whom, Mr. R. Arthur, of Mount Eden, carefully noted the height of the topmost edge as seen against the profile of a neighbouring hill. The angle of elevation, afterwards measured by Mr. Vickerman, of the Survey Department, gives a height above sea-level of 44,700 ft., or a little over eight miles. Great as this height may appear, it is less than the observed height of the column of steam arising from Krakatoa, as measured by Professor Verbeck in 1883, which was 50,000 ft. Arch deacon Williams, at Gisborne, who took some rough ob servations of the cloud, calculated the height to be six miles. \" . . . \" Subsequent observations prove that nothing was ejected from Wahanga, Ruawahia, and Tarawera but black and red scoria; and, as none of this fell after 6 a.m. on the 10th, it follows that the eruption was practically all over in six hours, as far as those mountains are concerned. But with respect to Rotomahana it is not so clear. Evi dently the mud which covers the country from Rotorua to that place came from there, and this ceased, in places where observations could be made, by 6 a.m. ; but whether the sand and ashes around Rotomahana and the southern group of craters were all ejected within that short place is doubtful. Most probably the eruption was in that locality of longer continuance. It had, however, quite ceased on any scale by the morning of the 13th, though paroxysmal outbursts from a large number of vents con tinued for some time longer, up to the 6th of August, when the black crater was in eruption for a short time. When we consider the changes that have taken place in the face of the country, and the depth and amount of solid matter removed by the action of water flashing into steam, it is marvellous that so much energy could have been com-"], [239, "219 VOLCANIC EFFECTS. pressed into so short a space of time. Obviously the mag nitude of the eruption must not be gauged by the time it lasted. It has already been stated that more or less dust, sand, or lapilli is to be found over an area of 5700 square miles, but the country affected in so far as vegetation has been injured, or grazing operations interfered with, is of much less extent, amounting to about 1500 square miles. Even in this area, fortunately, the country brought under settlement is not very great. The farms along the coast line of the Bay of Plenty, extending from Tauranga to Opotiki, have suffered considerably, and great loss has been entailed by the destruction of the grasses, necessi tating in many instances the removal of the cattle to other districts. But, generally speaking, the country is by no means permanently affected. Already the grasses are forcing their way through the covering of dust, whilst a general opinion seems to prevail that it will eventually benefit the light soils of the district by becoming incor porated with it.\" Mr. Smith reports, as the result of his observations, that the eruption has formed a fissure in the earth's crust, running nearly straight on a true bearing of 58\u00b0 for nearly nine miles. The fissure varies considerably in width and depth, being widest at Rotomahana, where it has a maxi mum breadth of a mile and a half, whilst its mean width where it crosses the mountain may be stated as an eighth of a mile. The depth is greatest at the northern end, where it is about 900 feet, and the least is at the southern end, where it may be said approximately to have a depth of 300 feet. The fissure, however, has not the appearance of a continuous rent, but it resembles rather a series of craters, not necessarily circular, arranged in a nearly straight line, and at various elevations above the sea-level. Rotomahana has become a great crater, with an east and west diameter of one and a half miles, and a north and south one of about the same. The area of the crater is slightly over two square miles, and it is encircled by precipitous and, in some places, perpendicular walls from 200 to 300 feet in depth. Below the walls the ground slopes by ridg-es and hollows to the central cavity, now filled by water. The height of this above sea-level is 565 feet, or 515 feet below the former level of Rotomahana"], [240, "220 VOLCANIC EFFECTS. Lake. I append a plan, No. 2, based on a topographical survey made specially by Mr. Smith to illustrate the changes in the country which have taken place since the eruption. It was difficult to have a clear view of the Rotomahana crater on account of the immense mass of steam arising from it. This steam-cloud he roughly esti mates as a mile in diameter, and as rising to over 10,000 feet, and frequently to 15,000 feet in height. He states that after sunset, when the deep cool purples of the base pass into orange and carmine in the upper part, the sight was indescribably beautiful. Occasionally visible through the cloud of steam there were some rugged pinnacles of black rock, rising to the height of the crater-rim, and having a special interest as marking the site of the hills which formerly stood close to the White Terraces. The exact position of the terraces could not be identified, as the ground around their former site has been blown away, but they were close to, and to the north-w-est of, the pin nacles. The site of the Pink Terraces could not be identified with more certainty than that of the White Terraces. The ground in this locality has been blown out to at least a hundred feet below the former level. It is but a moderate estimate, Mr. Smith adds, to assume that the depth of solid matter which has been removed from the crater by the eruption is 300 feet, in quantity equal to nearly 620,000,000 cubic yards, or, in other words, enough to cover 200 square miles a yard in depth. Mr. Smith writes as follows on the indirect cause of the eruption : \u2014 \u2022 \" It appears to the writer that all the evidence we have tends to prove the existence of a reservoir of molten heated matter within that part of the great fissure which under lies the mountains of Tarawera and Ruawahia, connected, of course, with the heated interior and with other parts of the great fissure. What the immediate cause of the erup tion was is a matter of pure speculation. Captain C. E. Dutton, of the United States Geological Survey, in his description of the Hawaiian volcanoes, says, ' Volcanic action and regional uplifting are really associated pheno mena, and the results of the same cause. When we come to inquire into the cause of elevatory movement of the earth's surface, we only encounter a mystery. No solu-"], [241, ""], [242, ""], [243, "221 THEORIES. tion has ever been given which does not go to pieces under criticism.' The Tarawera eruption appears to offer an example of the first stage in the formation of a volcanic mountain. It is, in fact, an incomplete effort to form a volcano. Whether the energy has exhausted itself in this effort, and matters will remain in a state of quiescence for long ages until it shall have again gathered strength to advance another stage, remains to be seen. As far as can be judged from the present state of affairs, the activity is fast dying out, and a return to the normal state appears imminent. Changes are for ever occurring in nature, and these will be watched with great interest in this locality. The crater of Rotomahana cannot remain for long in its present state : as the activity increases, the equilibrium at present existing cannot continue ; the drainage of the country which falls into the basin will no longer be carried off in steam, but begin to fill it with water and form a lake, probably of hot water. A time will come when this lake will increase to a much larger size than that which formerly occupied its site ; but an end to that will come. After rising for some 80 feet above the former level, it will then force its way over the barrier now thrown across the outlet, and when that time arrives a very few hours will see the greater part of this barrier removed, and then the waters of Rotomahana must form a devastating torrent as they pour down into Lake Tara wera. Luckily, that lake is of considerable extent, or otherwise the flood which would rise in the Tarawera river would prove more disastrous than any we have record of in this country. The face of the ash-covered country will change too. Vegetation will soon appear and prepare it for the uses of man. But never, alas ! can this compensate for the loss this colony, nay the world, has suffered in the destruction of those masterpieces of Nature's handiwork, the Pink and White Terraces.\" I conclude my reference to this destructive volcanic eruption by appending a short extract from some notes written and read before the Auckland Institute on the 26th of July, 1886, by Major W. G. Mair, who was an eye witness of the phenomenon from Taheke at Lake Rotoiti, about thirteen or fourteen miles distant from Mount Tarawera : \u2014"], [244, "222 EYE-WITNESS. \" At about a quarter-past one o'clock on the morning of the 10th (June, 1886), I was awakened by an earth quake. This was followed in a minute or so by a much heavier shock, which aroused every one in the place ; and then there succeeded, at intervals of about fifty seconds, a succession of vibrations, varying in character, some being uniform undulatory movements, others sharp and irregular, while some resembled the striking of heavy blows upwards. The state of things continued for half an hour. About 1.45, I was startled by a steady roar like that produced by a blast-furnace, or a great waterfall. A friend in an adjoining room called to me to look out of my window. My room was on the east side of the house ; and upon looking out I saw that all that side of the heavens was aglow, and there seemed to be a great column of fire rising to a height of about 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0, while above it was a dense column of black smoke. Masses of solid matter appeared to be hurled up amid showers of both ascending and descending sparks. At the same time there was a marvellous electrical display ; all the ordinary forms of lightning were there playing, as it were through the flame, the white light showing conspicuously against the red. Over and on either side of this there constantly flashed rounded masses of dazzling white light, as if caused by the explosion of bombs, and bayonets of sparks, which crackled like fireworks. My first impression was that there was an eruption of the Tikitiri Springs, two and a half miles distant ; hut upon ascending a hill I made out that the seat of action was Wahanga, the northernmost peak of Tarawera Mountain, some thirteen or fourteen miles distant. There was very little tremor of the earth at this stage. I went down to the lake shore (Rotoiti), but could not detect any disturbance there. A gentle breeze was blowing from the south-west, and in that direction the sky was perfectly clear. Later on, the roar became louder, with crashing reports, as of heavy bodies falling ; the thunder, too, increased, and the light ning was, if possible, more active. The shocks, too, were renewed with great vigour. At this time a dense black column rose on the right of the blaze, that is, more to the south and in the direction of Rotomahana, and spread out in the sky. Soon after three o'clock, the wind shifted to"], [245, "223 EYE- WITNESS. the south-east, and the black cloud was driven slowly in on the light, dropping over it like a veil, and by degrees blotting it out. For a time the lightning flashed through the murky mass, and then there came on the most utter and appalling darkness. The roar of the volcano could still be heard, and occasional tremendous peals of thunder; but these gradually died away. About four o'clock, there was a pattering of light cinders on the roof, and a sul phurous smell was apparent. Upon going outside I found the air charged with fine dust which was painful to the eyes.\" . . . \" Some Maoris then (later in the morning), by the aid of lanterns, found their way to the house, and reported that their huts were buried, and they feared that the roofs would fall in. At eight o'clock, there was still the most intense darkness, and no sound could be heard except an occasional rumble like thunder. The soft ooze was falling silently as snow, and covering everything up. At 9.30, there appeared a faint gleam of greenish light low down in the south ; and the wind having veered again to that quarter, the fall of sand gradually became less, and ceased altogether at eleven o'clock. By noon, one could read a newspaper in the open air, but the position of the sun could not be made out until two o'clock. Throughout the day there were occasional tremors of the earth, and thunder and lightning in the east. All along the ridge of Tarawera immense masses of smoke were being belched forth, while to the right a great column of steam arose, and further south a smaller one. All round Rotoiti every thing was covered with the grey volcanic deposit. In some places it was in drifts of eighteen inches deep, and nowhere was it less than eight inches. The fern and light shrubs in the open country were levelled with the ground, and in the woods every leaf and spray was covered. The telegraph wires were coated, and looked like ropes an inch thick. Numbers of straight dead tree-trunks were burning like great torches. The lake had become a soapy white colour, and had risen three or four inches, the water being unfit for domestic use.\" The south-eastern extremity of the provincial district of Auckland is the county of Cook. The chief town of this county, Gisborne, is on the right bank of the River Turanganui, at the mouth of which, in Poverty Bay,"], [246, "224 POVERTY BAY \u2014 NATIVES. Captain Cook first landed. The epithet \" Poverty \" given by Cook only signified his lack of supplies from the natives, as the epithet \" Plenty \" given to the northern bay signified the reverse. Gisborne, a small town with a population in 1886 of 2194 persons, is accessible to small vessels, but those of larger size anchor outside. Steamers connect the town with northern and southern ports; and roads go from it to Opotiki in the Bay of Plenty and to Clyde in Hawke's Bay. From the East Cape to Gisborne the land is good and undulating. There are indications of petroleum springs in a belt of country extending from the East Cape to the neighbourhood of Gisborne. Cook county contains much fine agricultural and pastoral land and valuable timber. The scenery is varied aud picturesque in many parts. The number of the Maori population residing in dis tricts south of the city of Auckland, and within the pro vincial district of Auckland, is returned in the census of 1886 as 20,425, of whom 11,021 are males and 9404 females. Their settlements are chiefly in the districts of the Thames, the Upper Waikato, the Hot Lakes, Taupo, Kawhia, Mokau, Tauranga, East Cape, and Poverty Bay. The reports (1887 and 1888) from the officers in charge of the several districts show the general state of this population. I briefly summarize their statements on some interesting points. In the Waikato district, which includes Waipa, Kawhia, and Upper Mokau, it appears that the breaking-up of the \" king\" party, which had been gradually and increasingly going on during the last four years, had entirely changed the former aspect of affairs. Sullen isolation had melted away, and friendly communion with Europeans was rapidly taking its place. The country, which had, until lately, been closed entirely against Europeans, was becoming as open and free, and as safe to travellers, as in any part of New Zealand. Surveys had been made over it ; roads ran through it ; the telegraph was at work within it ; prospecting for minerals was allowed ; and the North Island Great Southern Railway from Auckland had advanced thirty miles into the heart of it. There were also three native schools, all well attended, within its boundaries. Even on that most sensitive point,"], [247, "NATIVES. 225 the land question, the Native Land Court had conducted its investigation of title. Native industry was chiefly directed to earning money on public works, and it had proved itself to be very useful. The natives in the dis trict had become much more temperate than they were in former years. The change in that respect had been most marked. The average of crime was low. The natives were learning to appreciate the advantages of education provided for their children by the Government. The condition of the Maoris in the Thames district was undergoing a change. They did not, as formerly, live in large numbers at their different settlements, but separated themselves into families, or parties, to go away to the hills, where they dug for Kauri gum, and sometimes remained for months before returning. Their health had been fairly good. The schools were moderately well attended. The average of native crime within the district was very low. In the Tauranga district, the health of the native popu lation had been good, and few deaths have occurred. The pursuit of digging gum was the chief industry. The natives in the district were a sober people; the majority were total abstainers ; a native was seldom seen intoxi cated, and convictions for drunkenness were almost un known. Three native schools were at work. In the Rotorua and Maketu districts, the eruption of Tarawera Mountain had been a great disaster. About a hundred natives were killed, and hundreds were rendered homeless and forced to seek new abodes. Europeans and natives, as well as the Government, had subscribed liberally to a relief fund. The natives in these districts were certainly improving in sobriety, and there had been little or no crime during the past year. The school at Wairoa had been destroyed by the eruption, and the teacher and some of his family were killed. The other schools, six in all, were at work and well attended. In the district of Opotiki, eastward of Tauranga and Maketu, the natives were generally well clothed, well supplied with carts and agricultural implements ; and many owned spring-carts, and a few had buggies. Out of a native population of 3951 only nine had been con victed of drunkenness. At Whakatane, seventy natives Q"], [248, "226 NA TIVES\u2014IND US TRIES. had taken the pledge, and the use of spirits at native gatherings in the district was almost a thing of the past. Crime was very rare. The loss of native stock in the district, owing to the deposit of mud caused by the Tara wera eruption, had been severe. There were nine native schools at work, and the attendance and the progress of scholars had been good. The conduct of the natives during the past year had been friendly and peaceful. At Taupo, the natives had been quiet and orderly. Considerable sickness had prevailed. In the district of the East Cape and of Poverty Bay, the report was very satisfactory. There was little or no drunkenness ; and, with the exception of the murder of two Maoris, for which four others stood committed for trial by the Supreme Court, there had been very little crime. Six schools for native children were in full working order, and were well attended. There had been much fever of a typhoid type, and many cases had proved fatal. There was excellent feeling between the European settlers and the natives in the district. A chief, named Otene Pitau, gave a feast to celebrate the opening of a church, to which be invited Europeans and natives; and all were treated most hospitably. A Jubilee native festival was given at Gisborne, and it lasted three days. The assem blage, composed of many hundreds of natives and of European guests, was most orderly, and, although beer was supplied gratuitously, there was not a single case of drunkenness reported at the police-station. The Ngati porou Native Rifles, under Major Ropata and Captain Tuta Nihoniho, furnished guards each day and night, and general good order prevailed. The crops were abundant, and the natives attended more to cultivation of soil. Many were turning attention to whale-fishing, The chief industries in the provincial district of Auck land consist in ship and boat building, in furniture manu factories, in boot factories, in flax-mills, in rope and twine works, in sail-making, in aerated water and cordial manu factories, in breweries, in boiling-down, meat-freezing, and preserving works, in chaff-cutting works, in cooperages, in saw-mills, in collieries, and in quartz-mining (gold) works. The chief exports are gold, wool, Kauri gum, and timber."], [249, "227 LAND REGULATIONS. The principal Crown Land Office for the whole pro vincial district of Auckland is at the city of Auckland, and there are district Land Offices at Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty, and at Gisborne in Poverty Bay. Rural lands are sold by auction at an upset price per acre, fixed by a Land Board, and are classified as first, second, and third class lands, the minimum price per acre being 15s., 10s., and 5s. respectively. If rural or pastoral land is not sold after being put up to auction, it can be declared by the Land Board to be open to free selection after thirty days' notice. Town and suburban lands are also sold by auction at an upset price of not less than \u00a330 an acre for town, and \u00a33 for suburban, land. Pastoral lands are usually offered for sale on application. They may either be acquired by public auction in such cases as are from time to time fixed by the Land Board, the minimum price being 5s. per acre ; or they may be acquired by lease for a term of twenty-one years, no lease to exceed 10,000 acres, the minimum rental per acre being determined in each instance by the Land Board. Forest lands are occasionally sold by public auction as lands of special value, the upset price to be fixed in each instance by the Board ; but, in general, with respect to forest land, the right to cut and remove timber for building- and other purposes is usually leased at a premium, or foregift, for any term not exceeding seven years.

The provincial district of Hawke's Bay, originally part of the province of Wellington, and separated from it in 1858, lies between the provincial districts of Auckland and Wellington, south of that of Auckland, and north and east of that of Wellington. The area of the district is a little less than 3,000,000 acres. The population, according to the census of 1886, was 24,568 in number, consisting of 13,890 males and 10,678 females. The chief industry of the district is pastoral ; both the land and the climate are very suitable to the rearing of stock. The miscellaneous industries of the district include meat-freezing, meat-pre serving, tannery, soap-making, and tallow-boiling establish ments, fellmongering, saw-mills, flax and rope works, and other manufactories. The climate of Hawke's Bay district is very fine. The prevailing winds in the summer are north-east ; in winter the winds are uncertain ; gales from the north-east come on in March and April, and from the south-east during the winter months. The mean annual temperature at Napier, the chief town of the district, taken from obser vation during ten years, is 57'56\u00b0 ; the difference between the coldest and warmest months being 19'26\u00b0. The mean annual rainfall at Napier is 37'260 inches. There are occa sional dry seasons, lasting for two or three months, but they are infrequent. Frost is inconsiderable. English trees have been extensively introduced into the district,"], [251, "229 INTERIOR OF DISTRICT. and English birds and fishes, in considerable numbers, acclimatised. The northern part of the district is broken, but still is excellent sheep country ; towards the south there are rich alluvial plains and undulating hills. The land is watered by several rivers. The Ruahine range, the western boun dary, in winter capped with snow, is a striking feature. Looking at the lofty and massive ranges of Ruahine and Tararua, from 3000 to 4000 feet high, and running in a continuous chain for 150 miles between the eastern and western coasts, from the central interior to the southern waters of Cook Strait, it might naturally be supposed that they would practically prove to be an almost im passable barrier to transinsular communication, and would isolate the country on cither side. But, fortunately, Nature has provided against that calamity. The river Mana watu has its sources far to the eastward of these ranges, and, penetrating them through a narrow and winding gorge, flows into the sea on the west coast about forty miles to the south of Wanganui. Man has followed the river ; and a fine road, well engineered and of gentle grade, has for several years been open through the gorge, which scarcely seems broad enough for the rushing river. And now a railway through the gorge is in course of con struction, connecting the eastern and western railway lines of the island. The Manawatu Gorge is a grand piece of romantic scenery. The deep ravine, the precipitous cliffs hemming in the rapid torrent, the sombre forest, the foaming water, and the narrow road and railroad, in some parts almost overhanging the dark abyss, strike the spectator with astonishment and admiration. This remark able natural feature is fraught with incalculable import ance in facilitating the progress of settlement and the development of industry over the whole southern half of the North Island. It is another marvellous instance of Nature anticipating, and providing beforehand aid to, the colonisation of New Zealand. At the foot of the Ruahine and Tararua ranges, on the eastern side, lies the Seventy- Mile Bush, stretching southwards. This enormous forest contains almost inexhaustible supplies of valuable timber. The land, when cleared, is well suited for agriculture, as is generally the case with bush land in New Zealand."], [252, "230 FOREST \u2014 NAPIER. The cost of bush-felling in the district varies from \u00a31 10s. to \u00a32 10s. an acre. On the hillsides and on lightly timbered lands the settler can depend upon obtaining good clearings at the first burning-off . On the heavily timbered lands, the logs and stumps remain on the ground for several years before they rot off. The average cost of felling bush, burning off, and laying down with a good mixture of grasses is from \u00a32 10s. to \u00a33 10s. an acre. These remarks more or less apply to clearing and grassing forest-land in the North Island of New Zealand. Already this forest is dotted with extensive clearings and with numerous settlements. The railway from Napier towards the Manawatu Gorge goes through this forest. Wood ville, one of these settlements, is in the forest, a little to the north of the boundary line between the provincial districts of Hawke's Bay and of Wellington. The village of Woodville occupies a central position, into which the railway from Napier, and those almost completed, from Wellington via Masterton on the east coast, and from Wellington via Palmerston North * on the west coast, converge. The rivers Wairoa and Mohaka run into Hawke's Bay. The Wairoa is a considerable river, and, though its entrance is difficult, it is accessible to vessels of thirty to forty tons, and is navigable by boats for twelve miles. Clyde, a small town, is at the mouth of the Wairoa, and is connected with Napier by steamers and by road. One of its local industries is hop-growing. The river Mohaka is smaller and also difficult of entrance ; it can be entered by craft of ten tons. From the village of Mohaka, at the mouth of the river, there is a road to Napier, and another to Taupo in connection with the main roads in the interior. Napier, the chief town of the district of Hawke's Baj-, is a picturesque town built on a peninsula, called Scinde Island, ten or twelve miles from the southern cape of Hawke's Bay. The peninsula ends to the north in a group of small hills, the sides and tops of which are clotted with houses, gardens, and plantations, while on the flats at their base lies the business quarter of the town. The population of the borough of Napier, in 1886, * It is called Palmerston North to distinguish it from Palmerston South, in the South Island, in the provincial district of Otago."], [253, "231 NAPIER \u2014 NA TIVES. numbered 7680, consisting of 3970 males and 3710 females. Within the borough there are gas and water works, numerous public buildings, social and charitable institutions, high schools, and State schools. The port is about a mile from the town. The harbour is naturally adapted to vessels drawing only 10 or 11 feet of water, but is capable of considerable improvement. The Harbour Board has undertaken expensive works for that object. The roadstead has an anchorage in six fathoms good holding ground, about one mile off the harbour entrance ; moorings are laid down at the western anchorage. The roadstead is much exposed to a heavy swell during southerly and easterly gales, aud at times it is not possible to ride there, except when hanging- to those moorings. Important agricultural and pastoral shows are perio dically held at Napier. Shows of this kind, and also of horticulture, take place at large centres of population in every provincial district, and afford many persons con venient opportunities of seeing the varied resources and capabilities of different settlements. Napier has regular communication by steamers with the northern and southern ports, and with several small stations on the coast. The railway runs 97 miles from Napier to Woodville, and will shortly be completed, 17 miles, from Woodville to Palmerston. From Palmerston North the traveller can go by rail northward, via Wanganui, to New Plymouth (170 miles), or southward to the city of Wellington (88 miles) . The railway line between Woodville and Masterton (50 miles) will soon be open. Already 20 miles from Masterton towards Woodville are completed. From Masterton to Wellington (70 miles), the railway has been open for several years. Coaches run twice a week between Napier and Rotorua, by the way of Taupo. The number of natives resident in the provincial district of Hawke's Bay may be roughly estimated as 1700, of whom about 1000 are males. From the latest published reports (June, 1887, and May, 1888) of the resident magis trate in charge of the district, it appears that crime had been trifling, and that the natives had been industrious in ao-riculture and pasture. At Wairoa and Mahia, they had harvested considerable crops of grain, and their sheep had"], [254, "232 PROVINCIAL DISTRICT OF WELLINGTON. produced 155 bales of wool. At Mahia, they had captured thirty whales, valued at \u00a3300. The Crown Land Office for the district of Hawke's Bay is at Napier, where the Land Board meets. Rural lands are first offered at auction, and are afterwards usually thrown open for sale on application. Unsurveyed Crown lands cannot be sold until after survey and classification. The upset price for first-class land is not less than \u00a31 an acre; for second-class land, not less than 15s. au acre; and for third-class land, not less than 5s. an acre. Appli cations from persons desiring to have Crown lands surveyed and prepared for sale or lease will be considered by the Land Board. In all other respects the terms and conditions stated in the summary of land regulations in the Appendix apply to this district. Provincial District of Wellington. The provincial district of Wellington began in the settle ment of Wellington, founded, as I have stated in the early part of this work, in 1840 by the New Zealand Company. The area of the present district is about 6,000,000 acres, comprising the southern portion of the North Island. The population of the district, in the census of 1886, numbered 77,536 persons, of whom 41,650 are males and 35,886 females. The climate of the district is healthy and equable. Strong winds prevail in Cook Strait and its neighbourhood. The result of fourteen years' obser vations at the city of Wellington shows a mean annual temperature of 55 '58\u00b0, and at Wanganui 55\u00b0. The mean annual rainfall at Wellington was 50*781 inches. The district, as a whole, is well suited for small-farm settlers. Nature has been bounteous in her gifts to this part of the colony, but she has, at the same time, subjected their original use to the proof of very hard work and patient fortitude. The first settlers were confronted in every direction by mountain ranges, thick forests, and dangerous rivers. Industry, perseverance, aud heroic enterprise have done wonders, and have paved the way for the rapid advance of successful colonisation. Roads and railways cross the ranges, penetrate the forests, and bridge the rivers. Fertile plains are made accessible ; clearings are"], [255, "233 INTERIOR. opening up rich forest lands, and are making unlimited supplies of valuable timber available for the market. Villages, farms, homesteads, and huts of backwoodsmen are peopling solitudes with industrial life. For many years in early times the native difficulty was the most serious trouble, but it has succumbed to just, firm, and forbearing treatment. The district is aland of mountains, of forests, and of plains. The great plains of Wairarapa run south from Masterton, between the Tararua and Rimutaka ranges on the west, and the Maungaraki and Haurangi mountains on the east, to the Wairarapa Lake, and thence to Palliser Bay, a distance of about 50 miles, in Cook Strait. The western division of the district has large tracts of level and undulating bush country, and is valuable in timber, and in land, when cleared, of rich and productive kind. The country is well watered. The river Hutt flows into Wellington Harbour; and other large rivers, the Wanganui, the Rangitikei, and the Manawatu, flow into the sea on the west coast. Forests are a con- spicuous feature in the district. As I have stated before, in addition to the value of the timber, the clearing of forest land, though it necessarily involves much labour, leaves the land more fertile than much good land in an open country. The average cost of cleaning and laying the land down with a good mixture of grasses is from \u00a32 10s. to \u00a33 10s. an acre. The scenery in the forests is beautiful, but it is fast passing away before the march of civilised man. It is sensibly thinning at the edges, and, within its inmost recesses, bald patches are more and more frequently found. Welcome as always must be the signs of coming cultivation, it cannot be denied that, in a picturesque point of view, the transition of forest land from the hand of Nature to the hand of man is often a disfigurement. When fire and axe are doing their destructive work among grand old trees aud the infinite variety of luxuriant undergrowth, the scene is like the battlefield strewn with the dying and the dead, watched by charred trunks, standing here and there like mourners waiting for the burial. And here a practical word may be said on the destruction of New Zealand forests. Much of that destruction is wanton ; and it is increasing at such an enormous rate of progression, that it seriously behoves"], [256, "234 IND USTRIES \u2014 RABBITS. the colonists to take prudent measures for preventing waste of timber, and for replacing it to some extent when it is necessarily cut down. The chief industries of the district are pasture, agri culture, and timber trade ; and there are, among other local industries, boiling-down and meat-preserving works, freezing meat, fellmongering, tanning, and wool-scouring, saw-mills, and sash and door manufactories, brick, tile, and pottery works, iron and brass foundries, coach-building and painting, rope and twine works, breweries, and aerated water and cordial manufactories. The greater part of the pastoral land within the district lies in its eastern division, and, like sheep runs in the South Island, has suffered considerably from rabbits. And here a few words may be said to show the serious mischief caused by these animals. The rabbit is not indigenous to New Zealand. It has run wild there about twenty-five years, and at first its acclimatisation was thought likely to be a public boon. It was looked upon as a harmless animal, likely to give fair sport, and to be wholesome food ; and no one at the time thought much of its eating grass. Its fecundity has made it formidable. In an old and populous country, where its increase is kept in due bounds by \"natural animals,\" that fecundity is not of much moment; but in a new country, where popula tion is small, and the conditions of rabbit life are specially favourable, the increase has been disastrous. From sheer force of numbers the rabbit has been like the plague of locusts in many large pastoral districts. In many cases, owing to the ravages of the rabbit, runs have been abandoned, flocks have been starved, wool sacrificed, and sheep -farmers ruined. Special legislation and large public and private expenditure have been necessary in organising death to the rabbit. Traps, guns, poisons, dogs, cats, ferrets, and fumigation have, singly and jointly, aided in the slaughter of that animal ; and late official reports show that little appreciable diminution of the evil has been effected. Some idea of what has been done by man in New Zealand towards the destruction of rabbits may be gathered from statistics. The number of rabbit skins exported from the colony during the year ending- December 31st, 1887, was 12,743,452 ; and the total aggre-"], [257, "EXPORTS \u2014 CITY OF WELLINGTON. 235 gate number exported from the colony during seven years was 63,325,944. The estimated value of these skins for these seven years collectively may be estimated at more than \u00a3500,000 sterling, but that amount ill corresponds with the public and private losses suffered from the rabbit pest, losses which aggregately can only be measured by millions of pounds. The chief exports of the provincial district of Wellington are wool, frozen meat, tallow, timber, butter, barley, and fungus. The last item is a native fungus which grows in large quantity on decaying forest trees. It is sent to China, where it is much prized, both as a medicine and as an element of food ; it is also said to be used there as a dye. Above \u00a317,000 worth of this fungus was exported during 1887 from the colony. The city of Wellington in 1865 became the seat of government in the colony. The Governor and the Ministers reside there, the chief executive departments are stationed there, and the Colonial Parliament holds there its annual sessions. The occupation of Wellington is a good proof of the success of industrial and intellectual work in the ser vice of colonisation. Nature had provided an excellent harbour, but she interposed great obstacles to its use for the purposes of settlement. The harbour was walled in by high ranges covered with thick and almost impene trable forest ; there was not room for a town on the shore of that part of the harbour where vessels could safely lie ; and the strong winds of Cook Strait often delayed for several days the arrival or the departure of sailing vessels. Except for a few miles northward, up the valley of the Hutt, there was at first no room for expansion ; and that valley was itself a dense forest. The town skirting the edge of Lambton Harbour was hemmed in by the sea in front and by cliffs at the back. The change now is so great that all this seems like a bad dream. The town has not only extended north and south, but it has spread laterally over large tracts reclaimed from the harbour. Steamers now run every day to and from Wellington with unvarying punctuality. First-rate roads join the harbour with large fertile districts inland ; and railways give easy access to the east and west coasts. The progress of the city has been very great. The*"], [258, "236 CITY OF WELLINGTON \u2014 HARBOUR. population in the census of 1886 was 25,945 in number. Owing to the severe shocks of earthquake which were felt at Wellington in 1849 and 1855, the buildings in the town have been almost all of wood, but there has been for some years back a growing disposition to build in concrete and in brick. The chief public buildings are Government House, the Houses of Parliament, the Supreme Court, the Government Offices, the Wellington College, and the Hospital. The Parliament buildings are lighted by the electric light. The city is supplied by waterworks ; the streets are well laid out, and are lighted by gas ; and tram cars run long distances. There are many educational, re ligious, literary, commercial, and social institutions. The Colonial Museum at Wellington has considerable collec tions in departments of natural history, minerals, and ethnology, besides many miscellaneous articles. A labo ratory and a public library are attached to the museum, and there is an excellent library in the adjacent Parliament building. A large public reserve, called the Town Belt, for public recreation, runs the whole inland length of the city, and is a healthy and picturesque resort for the citizens; the Botanical Gardens which form part of it are well kept, and contain a nursery-ground of valuable trees and plants for distribution to all parts of the colony. The view of the town from Flagstaff Hill is pleasing. Below are thick clusters of houses on the flats of Te Aro and Thorndon, joined by two intervening fringes, one of villas dotting an elevated terrace, and the other of shops and stores broadening on the beach ; while the lake-like harbour lies within its amphitheatre of hills, and in the far distance northward are seen the forest-clad and lofty peaks of the Tararua range. The harbour (formerly called Port Nicholson) is excellent and spacious, and its central position is a great advantage for commercial purposes. Strong gales are frequent in Cook Strait, and changes from the one to the other of the two prevailing directions, north-west and south-east, are often sudden. South-easterly gales are most frequent in the winter months, May, June, and July, and, with a falling barometer, last often three or four days, and generally bring on rain and thick weather. North-west gales are more common in spring and summer; they are"], [259, "237 HARBOUR \u2014 WEST COAST. generally shorter in duration, with a high barometer. There is a good lighthouse, with a light visible in ordinary weather at a distance of 30 miles, at the top of Pencarrow Head, the eastern entrance point of the harbour. Lamb ton Harbour, on the shore of which the city stands, has a good anchorage. The Queen's Wharf and the Railway Wharf furnish excellent accommodation for large ships, and have every appliance for loading and discharging cargoes. The port is a scene of great commercial activity. The Colonial Observatory is at Wellington, and communi cates electrically with a time ball, which can be used for rating chronometers. The number of registered vessels belonging, on the 31st of December, 1886, to the port of Wellington was 18 sailing vessels, in all 3957 tons ; and 26 steamers, in all 3189 tons. In addition to the statistical record of meteorology, a system of weather forecasts has been established under Captain Edwin, R.N., since 1873, and forms now, under his personal superintendence, a section of the Meteorological Department in charge of Sir James Hector, K.C.M.G., F.R.S. Daily forecasts are given. The usefulness of the system is generally recog nised in the colony. The chief industries of the city of Wellington are connected with its requirements as a large seaport town, such as foundries and other works for the repair and supply of ships ; there are also boot factories, saw-mills, soap and candle works, and others for aerated waters and for tanning ; meat-freezing works, coach-building ; and a woollen factory is in course of erection. The country on the west coast from Wellington to Wanganui has undergone a wonderful change, in a colonising point of view, since 1870. For many years the only coach road between these two places was for sixty miles along the sea-beach. It was obvious that a beach road did not really open up the country for the purposes of colonisation, but financial and political difficulties had prevented the formation of a road inland, across what was native territory. Since 1870, the attainment of the larger object has been earnestly pursued and with great success. The natives have disposed of large tracts of fertile land which they did not use or want, and a railway runs from Wellington to Wanganui, through the heart of this"], [260, "238 MANCHESTER SETTLEMENT\u2014 WANGANUI. territory, and extends to New Plymouth, thus opening up an excellent and pastoral district, settled by a popu- lation of above forty thousand Europeans and of about nine thousand natives, and producing large quantities of grain and meat. The Manawatu river, which runs westward across part of this country, is comparatively easy of access to small vessels from the sea, the channel being straight and the bar not having been known to shift. Vessels drawing nine feet can enter at high water and proceed up the river fifty miles. Settlements and cultivation have changed the whole face of the country. The settlement of the \"Manchester Block,\" which has been colonised by a private company under special agreement made with it by the New Zealand Government, has been a material factor in this transformation. The river Rangitikei flows into the sea on the west coast, about ten miles to the north of the mouth of the Manawatu. Coasters drawing six feet can enter the Rangitikei, which is navigable for boats 50 miles. The Wanganui river has its entrance in the depth of the great bight between Cape Terawiti and Cape Egmont on the west coast, about midway between both. The river is navigable up to the town of Wanganui, four miles from the mouth, for craft of ten or twelve feet draught. The course of the Wanganui is about 120 miles long, and its source is in the centre of the island near Lake Taupo. The scenery along the river is in some places very picturesque. From rising ground near the mouth, the view in clear weather embraces the ranges of Ruahine and Tararua to the south-east ; the snowy mass of Ruapehu towering among the clouds to the north, and the solitary cone of Mount Egniont to the north-west. The town of Wanganui lies on the right bank of the river, about four miles from the mouth. The river is crossed by a fine iron bridge, which, with its approaches, is nearly 600 feet long ; it has a swing span 130 feet long, to allow, when open, a clear passage for vessels. The town is a borough, with a population in 1886 of 4901 in number. The town is lighted with gas, and has water works. Considerable wharfage accommodation exists ; and the local Harbour Board has done much to improve the harbour. The surrounding country is agricultural and"], [261, "239 NA TI VES \u2014 TAR A NAKI. pastoral, and careful attention is paid to the breeding of stock. The number of the native population within the pro vincial district of Wellington, the northern boundary of which is a little to the north-westward of Wanganui, may be roughly estimated at about 4000 in number, of whom about two-fifths are females. This population is dis persed, but chiefly resides in the Wairarapa and west coast districts. The latest official reports give a favour able account of their condition, and of their peaceful behaviour. The chief Crown Land Office for the provincial district of Wellington is in the city of Wellington. Rural lands are not opened for sale until after the survey ; they may then be offered for application at \u00a31 per acre, or, if declared of special value, sold by auction at an upset price greater than \u00a31. If land is not sold after being put up to public auction, it can be declared by the Land Board to be open for free selection after thirty days' notice. An official summary of the land law relating to the whole colony is printed in the Appendix. Provincial District of Taraxaki. The provincial district of Taranaki is on the west coast of the North Island, between the provincial districts of Wellington and Auckland. Its area is 2,137,000 acres, and it is estimated that two-thirds of this are suitable for settlement. It was founded in 1841 by the New Zealand Company, and the early immigrants were from the English counties of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, and Hants. The record of the Taranaki settlement for more than thirty years from its foundation is, as I have shown in preceding pages, a series of struggles on the part of the settlers against native difficulties, want of Crown land, isolation, and the native war ; and it is only just to recognize the fortitude and patience with which the settlers have borne their sufferings. The settlement may now be said to have emerged from the darkness which overshadowed it into the light of hopeful prospects ; and industry can now reap its just reward. The population of the district of Taranaki, in March, 1886, was 17,999 in"], [262, "240 CLIMATE \u2014 COUNTRY \u2014 NEW PLYMOUTH. number, consisting of 9576 males and 8423 females. The climate of Taranaki is very healthy and pleasant. During the summer months (from November to February) there are generally regular land and sea breezes, but in winter the weather is changeable. South-west is the prevailing quarter for gales. The mean yearly temperature at New Plymouth (taken from fourteen years' observations) is 57*56\u00b0 ; the difference between the coldest and warmest months is 15*66\u00b0. The mean yearly rainfall at New Ply mouth is 58'084 inches. Both in the North and South Islands the rainfall is much greater on the west than on the east coast. The scenery in many parts of the district is beautiful, and culminates in the grand cone of Mount Egmont, which rises 8000 feet from the midst of surround ing forest, and dominates, as it were, the district. From every direction the eye can rest on that majestic sight with untiring delight. Countless streams radiate from Mount Egmont throughout the country. A large extent of Taranaki is forest land abounding with valuable timber and firewood. The land, when cleared and burned, is at once ready for cropping. Northward from Patea river towards New Plymouth, the chief town of the district, the coast line forms for about thirty miles a slight inward curve ; and along the coast there is a belt of land varying in breadth from one to twelve miles, generally open and grassy up to the margin of the inland forest ; and the soil is fertile. New Plymouth, standing on ground gradually rising from the beach, has a fine view of the sea in front, while inland is seen the snowy cone of the majestic mountain. The town, with its houses embosomed amid gardens and shrubberies, has a pleasing look of rural comfort. The roadstead is open to all winds from south-west round by north to east-north-east. There are generally, during the summer months, regular land and sea breezes, but in winter the weather is changeable, and the spring and fall of the year bring the strongest gales. South-west is the prevailing quarter. North-west winds, which blow directly on shore, seldom blow home, and are generally preceded by a swell from that direction. The local Harbour Board has been for several years engaged in extensive works for the construction of a harbour, by means of a breakw-ater at the Sugarloaves, about two"], [263, "241 IR ON SAND \u2014 IND USTRIES. miles from the town. Steamers run frequently from New Plymouth to other ports in the colony, and a railway connects New Plymouth and Wellington. Ironsand abounds on the Taranaki coast, especially near the town of New Plymouth. Sir James Hector, the Director of the Geological Survey in the colony, remarks as follows, in the fourth edition (1886) of his Handbook, on the subject of this iron ore, which is found plenti fully in other parts of the west coast of both islands : \u2014 \" Several companies have been formed both in England and the colony to manufacture steel direct from this iron sand. They have not, however, succeeded, but a partial success was attained by smelting, in furnaces, brick formed of the ore with calcareous clay and carbonaceous matter, and recently the sand has been treated by a continuous cementation process that produces puddled blooms. It remains to be proved, however, if it can be profitably treated in large quantities by this or any other process. A company called the New Zealand Iron and Steel Company, Limited, is now at work at Onehunga for the purpose of making bar iron from the ironsand by a direct process, and has given notice of intention to claim a bonus of \u00a31000 offered by the Colonial Government for the production of two hundred tons of wrought-iron bloom.\" The chief exports of Taranaki are butter and live stock. The local industries of the district are chiefly pastoral and agricultural ; the local manufactories include coach building, furniture-making, grain-mills, breweries, aerated waters and cordials, boiling down and meat preserving, saw-mills and sash and door works, fellmongering, tanning, and wool-scouring. From New Plymouth, northward, the coast trends in a north-easterly direction to Waitara, twelve miles, to which the railway runs. Waitara river is accessible to small craft. The land is a little broken, and is very fertile. North of Waitara the coast line runs for ten miles easterly to the Urenui river, and thence north-easterly for about twenty-five miles to the river Mokau, the northern boundary of the provincial district. From the Waitara northward the soil is adapted to grain crops. Near Urenui the soil is clay well suited for brickmaking. At Mokau fine brick clay abounds. At Urenui the finest B"], [264, "242 CONFISCATED LAND \u2014 NATIVES. apples, peaches, and grapes grow luxuriantly. The river Mokau is navigable for boats for many miles. Coals are found in the district of Mokau. The land is in the hands of the natives, but there is good hope that the owners will give facilities for its settlement and the development of its industrial resources. A few words are necessary to explain the special position of confiscated land in Taranaki. Proclamations in 1865 confiscated a very large extent of land there, with unde fined reservations of land belonging to loyal natives and of land to be returned to rebel natives on their submission. After the adjustment of all the interwoven and multi tudinous claims to land within the confiscated area, it was estimated that about 30,000 acres of open land and about 100,000 acres of forest land would be available to the Crown for colonisation. The difficult work of adjusting this troublesome question was satisfactorily performed by Commissioners Sir William Fox and Sir Francis Bell. Sir William Fox acted as -sole Commissioner from 1880, when Sir Francis Bell was appointed Agent-General in London for New Zealand, to 1884. The excellent work of this commission has peacefully settled a question of great danger to the maintenance of good relations between the two races, and has opened up a fine and fertile country which is now being quietly and rapidly brought under cultivation. Roughly estimated, the number of natives usually resident in the district of Taranaki may be taken as about 3000, of whom somewhat less than one-half are females. This district has been, as has already been stated, the scene of war, and its native condition has since, till 1884, been a source of great anxiety. It is gratifying to note that this bad state of things has passed away, and, if proper prudence on the part of the settlers and the Government be exercised, is not likely to return. The last official report (May 26th, 1888) on native affairs in the district corroborates this view. The principal Land Office is at New Plymouth, and there are District Land Offices at Patea and Haw-era. Town lands can only be sold at auction for cash.

Provincial District of Nelson. The provincial district of Nelson lies at the north-western extremity of the South Island. The area of the district is 7,000,000 acres. The settlement of Nelson was founded by the New Zealand Company in 1841. The general character of the country is mountainous and rugged, the scenery is bold, and the soil in many of the valleys is very fertile. The climate generally is soft and genial in the low lands, especially in the city of Nelson and in its neighbourhood. The result of eleven years' observation at Nelson shows a mean annual temperature of 54'86\u00b0 ; the difference between the coldest and warmest months being 17T0\u00b0. The average rainfall for the year at Nelson was 6P599 inches. The climate on the west coast is more equable, but the rainfall there is much greater. The population of the provincial district of Nelson in 1886 was 30,203 in number, consisting of 16,878 males and 13,325 females. The district is agricultural and pastoral, and, in parts, rich in gold, coal, limestone, iron ore, and other economic minerals. Hops are extensively grown, and Nelson is celebrated for its beer. Fruits also, of all kinds grown in England, flourish luxuriantly. The chief local manufactories are quartz-mining, grain-mills, breweries, rope and twine works, steam saw-mills, sash, door, and furniture works, and hematite paint works. The value of gold exported from the ports of Nelson and"], [267, "245 CITY OF NELSON\u2014 COAL MINES. Westport (in the provincial district) during 1887 was \u00a313,711 at Nelson, and \u00a338,187 at Westport. The city of Nelson is situated at the head of Blind Bay. The harbour is formed between the mainland and the Boulder Bank, a long and remarkable bank, very narrow, and, in its southern part, acting as a natural breakwater to the anchorage. There is good anchorage outside the bar. The passage into the harbour is very narrow ; and there is a bar on which at spring tides there is a depth of twenty-one feet. The services of experienced pilots are available. There is excellent wharf accommodation at the port. The city, about two miles from the port, with which it is connected by railway, is picturesquely situated inland. The population of the city in 1886 was 7315 in number, consisting of 3555 males and 3760 females. The city is well supplied with water and gas. There is a good public college, in addition to public schools. The city and suburbs, interspersed with gardens and orchards, abounding with flowers, vegetables, and fruit, and cosy cottages, present charming pictures of rustic ease. Steamers are constantly plying between Nelson and other ports in both islands. The railway is open (21 miles) to Belgrove, and its extension to the Government line at Greymouth is proposed by private enterprise. Coaches run to and from Lyell, Reef ton, Greymouth, and Hokitika. The provincial district of Nelson is naturally divisible into three districts \u2014 the Blind Bay or Waimea district, the West Coast district, and the Amuri and Cheviot district. The district of Waimea is agricultural, and contains many thriving homesteads. Hops are extensively grown in this district ; the area of hop-gardens within it in February, 1887, was 456 acres. The West Coast district is noted for its coal-mining and gold-mining industries. Sir James Hector, in the fourth edition (1886) of his \" Official Hand book of New Zealand,\" writes as follows on the subject of coal in this district : \u2014 \" Bituminous Goal is worked chiefly in the Nelson district. At Mount Rochfort or Buller mines, the seams are on a high plateau, and are 10 feet to 40 feet thick, and from 900 feet to 3000 feet above sea-level. Accurate surveys of this coalfield show it to contain 140,000,000 tons of bituminous coal of the best quality and easily"], [268, "246 COAL MINES. accessible. A Government railway, seventeen miles m length, is now completed along the level country at the base of the ranges in which the coal occurs, aud from which it is lowered by incline planes constructed by the coal-mining companies. The principal mine is the Banbury, which has a magnificent seam of hard bitu minous coal at an altitude of 1800 feet above the sea-level. At the Brunner coal mine, on the Grey river, Nelson, the working face of the seam is eighteen feet, and it has been proved to extend one-third of a mile on the strike without disturbance, and to be available for working in an area of thirty acres, the estimated amount of coal being 4,000,000 tons in this mine alone, most of which can be worked above the water-level. Coal-Pit Heath is a second mine lying more to the dip of the same seam. A third mine was for a time opened on the south side of the river, which, with a 370-feet shaft, will command 300,000 tons. The coal from the Brunner mine, Nelson, which has now been worked for fifteen years, yields vitreous coke, with brilliant metallic lustre. Average evaporative power of several samples, 7-J- lb. of boiling water converted into steam for each pound of coal. It occurs with grits and conglomerates of Upper Mesozoic age, corresponding to the horizon of the Gault or Lower Greensand. A railway has been constructed by Government to connect the mine with the port, and harbour improvements are in progress, whereby a larger class of vessels than at present will be enabled to enter the river. The small quantity of this coal hitherto obtainable in New Zealand and Australian markets has been eagerly bought up for gasworks and iron foundries, wThich generally pay for it from 10 to 20 per cent, more than for any other coal. Engineers of local steamers esteem it 20 per cent, better than the best New South Wales coal for steam purposes. Coke made from it is valued at \u00a33 per ton. Coalfields in other parts of the Nelson district have also yielded excellent coal. At Murray Creek, Inangahua, an 18-feet seam of semi-bitu minous coal is worked, associated with quartz grits. At Pakawau, and in the same formation at Collingwood, thin seams of hard bright bituminous coal have been worked from the sandstones of the Cretaceous period. The area of the coalfield is about thirty square miles, and the"], [269, "247 COAL MINES \u2014 GOLD. facilities of access and shipping and the abundance of iron ore and limestone will probably make this an important mining district. The chief coal mine has been opened by a tunnel 700 feet in length, piercing the mountain at 600 feet above the flats along the Aorere river, the coal being brought down by a self-acting incline. This description of coal also occurs in the irregular seams in sandstone of Upper Mesozoic age (Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous) at Kawakawa and Whangarei, Auckland ; Mount Hamilton and Waikawa, Otago. It rarely cakes strongly, and has commonly an evaporative power of 6i lb.\" The output from the mines in the western district of Nelson during 1887 was 283,981 tons. The value of gold exported from the district, including Greymouth, which, though itself within the provincial district of Westland, is actually the port from which the gold produced at Reefton, the chief quartz-reef gold-field in the district of Nelson, is exported, amounted during the year 1887 to \u00a3220,503. The approximate value of all mining plant used in the district in 1887 was \u00a3182,430. This is in addition to water races, etc., the approximate cost of which is estimated at \u00a3361,910. The Amuri and Cheviot district comprises the most inland and southern part of the Nelson district. It is chiefly pastoral ; a large part of it consists of downs, interspersed with rough hills. Thermal springs exist on the Hanmer plains in the south of the district, and are known for their sanatory properties in cases of rheuma tism and* cutaneous affections. These springs, now easily accessible, in the course of a few hours, by rail and coach, from Christchurch, the capital of the provincial district of Canterbury, are reserved as public baths ; and accommo dation for visitors, the number of whom rapidly increases, is provided. The chief Land Office is at Nelson, and there are local Land Offices at Westport, Ahaura, and Reefton. Rural land is sold by auction at an upset price of from 10s. to \u00a32 an acre, as may be fixed by the Land Board. Rural land may also be purchased on application, subject to the approval of the Land Board, at the maximum price of \u00a32 an acre, the applicant paying the cost of surveying the land, if distant from survey limits."], [270, "248 MARLB OR 0 UGH\u2014 PIC TO N. \\ Provincial District of Marlborough. Marlborough was originally part of the province of Nelson, and was separated from it in 1859. The district lies at the north-eastern extremity of the South Island, and has an area of 2,560,000 acres, of wbich about one half is pastoral land ; 200,000 acres agricultural ; 50,000 acres forest land, fit for cultivation after clearing; and the remainder mountainous, heavily timbered, and rugged. The population of Marlborough in 1886 was 11,113 in number, of which there were 6223 males and 4890 females. The climate of the district is genial and equable. The result of five years' observation shows a mean temperature of 53\"4\u00b0, the highest mean being 64'3\u00b0, and the lowest, 42*8\u00b0. Slight frosts occur in winter, and snow is rarely seen except on the tops of lofty mountains. Most plants which in England are greenhouse plants live out during the winter without protection. The chief produc tions of Marlborough are wool and timber. There are several works for making furniture, rope and twine, for fish-curing, for boiling down and tallow-making, for brewing, besides saw-mills, flour-mills, and brick, tile, and pottery manufactures. Gold, antimony, and minerals of various kinds are found. Picton is situated in _a picturesque bay, Waitohi, at the head of Queen Charlotte's Sound. The population in 1886 was 733 in number. This sound is historical as the scene of Captain Cook's visits, and as the favourite resort of his ships. The approach to Picton from Wellington by sea, 60 miles, is, for the last third of the route, through channels of still water embosomed amid lofty hills. Queen Charlotte's Sound has two outlets into Cook Strait, the main one northward, and the other through Tory Channel. There are several coves on either side with good anchorage. The length of Queen Charlotte's Sound is about twenty five miles; both sides are indented with numerous bays with good anchorage. The land is high and generally wooded. The almost contiguous sound, Pelorus Sound, is similar in general features to Queen Charlotte's Sound, and extends in a southerly direction about twenty-five miles, branching off to the eastward and westward in numerous arms and creeks, and comprising an extent of"], [271, "249 BLENHEIM\u2014 CANTERB UR 7. coast not less than 250 miles. Except at the head of the main branch, the adjoining country is mountainous and covered with thick forests, and the shores of the inter vening bays are intersected by steep and rugged ravines. The Wakamarina gold-field is in the valley of a tributary of the Pelorus river; the gold workings are carried on in the bed of the river, and also partly consist of hydraulic sluicing on the banks and in the valley, and of quartz mining. Blenheim lies nearly in the centre of the Wairau plain, at the junction of the Omaka and Opawa rivers. It is the chief town of the district, and its population in 1886 was 3091 in number. A railway connects Picton and Blenheim, and is in course of extension from Blenheim to the Awatere district, which comprises large sheep runs. The Wairau Valley is an extensive plain of fertile land, and is watered by the Wairau and other rivers. To the south are the Awatere, Clarence, and Kaikoura districts, mainly occupied by sheep runs. Steamers connect Picton and Blenheim respectively with other ports. From Picton to Nelson the steamers go through the picturesque French Pass, a narrow strait 540 yards across at high water, between the south end of D'Urville Island and the main land ; the channel, which is deep and straight, is only 117 yards broad. The scenery is romantic, and as a fish ing-place this pass is almost unequalled in New Zealand. The Land Office of the district is at Blenheim. Rural lands are classified by the Land Board for purposes of sale into agricultural and pastoral classes, the upset prices per acre being not less than \u00a31 and 10s. respectively. Land must be surveyed before sale, but an applicant may, with the approval of the Land Board, select unsurveyed land, and have it surveyed at his own cost, in respect of which he is protected, in case of competition. Provincial District of Canterbury. The provincial district of Canterbury comprises the eastern central part of the South Island. The Canter bury Association, under an arrangement made by it with the New Zealand Company, founded the settlement in 1850 ; and on the 16th of December in that year the first emigrant ship from England arrived at Port Cooper, now"], [272, "250 CANTERBURY \u2014 RIVERS \u2014 MOUNTAINS. Port Lyttelton. The original boundaries of the provincial district included Westland, but in 1867 Westland was separated. The area of Canterbury, as it now exists, is 8,693,000 acres, of which about 2,500,000 acres form an open plain, gently sloping down from the western range to the sea, and covered originally with excellent natural pasturage. Canterbury has a coast line of about 200 miles, near the centre of which stands out the bold moun tainous projection of Banks' Peninsula, 30 miles long and 18 broad, containing many good harbours and forest land. The capital of the provincial district, Christchurch, is built on the plain immediately northwards of the peninsula, on the river Avon, about five miles from the sea. The port town is Lyttelton, situated in one of the harbours in Banks' Peninsula. It is seven miles from Christchurch, with which it is connected by rail through a tunnel of 2838 yards in length. The country is watered by rivers flowing from the western mountain range across the plain to the sea. The chief rivers are the Hurunui, the Wai makiriri, the Rakaia, the Ashburton, the Rangitata, and the Waitaki, all extremely rapid, and flowing on shingle beds sometimes more than a mile wide. These rivers and others may generally be forded in places, but when in flood they are very dangerous. There are now, however, in addition to the railroad bridges, bridges on the main lines of road. In many parts of the provincial district, water is obtained at a moderate depth, and, in the agri cultural belt along the coast, an artesian supply can gene rally be obtained by sinking about 80 feet. In Christ church, many hundred wells of this kind provide an ever flowing supply of the purest water. Irrigation works of an extensive character have been constructed in some of the rural districts. It is difficult to over-estimate the practical importance of such works in many parts of the Canterbury plains. The mountain scenery of Canterbury is very fine. The snow-capped range of the Southern Alps, bounding the western horizon high above the plains, is a magnificent natural feature ; and in the heart of the mountains, forest, lake, glacier, precipice, and torrent contribute to the Alpine scenery infinite variety and grandeur. The climate of Canterbury is well adapted to English"], [273, "251 CLIMATE. constitutions. The variations of temperature are more sudden than in England, but the difference between the extremes of heat and cold is not so great. There is none of the \" mugginess \" which occasionally makes the summer heat in England so oppressive. On the plains, the number of days in the year on which snow or sleet falls is very small, and snow seldom remains on the ground for any length of time. Frosts are common in winter, but not severe ; and many plants and shrubs that in England require to be carefully housed during the winter months flourish in the open air in Canterbury. English domestic animals thrive ; and all English grain, grass, flowers, and fruit grow in perfection. Of course in the hills the climate is colder. In some years there are dry seasons, and in others an excessive rainfall, but both are exceptional. The result of twelve years' observation at Christchurch shows a mean temperature for the year of 52'88* ; the difference between the coldest and warmest months being 18'72\u00b0. At Bealey, 2104 feet above the sea, the result of nine years' obser- vation shows a mean annual temperature of 46' 76\u00b0; the difference between the coldest and warmest months being 18*18\u00b0. The mean yearly rainfall at Christchurch was 25'774 inches. The prevailing wind for nine months, par- ticularly on the coast, is the north-east sea-breeze ; and, in the winter months, southerly and south-westerly winds prevail, and it seldom rains from any other quarter. At times, in summer, the north-west wind blows hard. I take this opportunity of drawing attention to some re- markable facts which Dr. Hector, who has conducted meteorological observations throughout New Zealand for many years, states, in the 1886 edition of his Handbook of New Zealand, when comparing the climate on the east and west coasts respectively of both islands. He writes as follows : \u2014 \" The climate on the west coast of both islands is more equable than on the east, the difference between the average summer and winter temperature being nearly 4\u00b0 greater on the south-east portion of the North Island, and 7\u00b0 on that of the South Island, than on the north-west, on which the equatorial winds infringe. This constant wind is the most important feature in the meteorology of New Zealand, and is rendered more striking by comparing the annual fluctuation of temperature on."], [274, "252 CLIMA TE \u2014 IND USTRIES. the opposite sea-boards of the South Island, which have a greater range of temperature by 18\u00b0 at Christchurch on the east than at Hokitika on the west. The contrast between the rainfall on the east and wTest coasts, as with the temperature, is most striking. Thus, in the North Island, Napier on the east has only half the amount of rain that falls in Taranaki on the west. But the South Island, with its longitudinal range of lofty mountains, exhibits this feature in a still more marked manner, for the rainfall on the west is nearly five times greater than that on the east. The excess of precipitation on the coast is clearly illustrated by the distribution of the glaciers on the opposite sides of the range. Those on the west slope have an excessive supply of snow, and descend to a line where the mean annual temperature is 50\u00b0 Fahr., while on the east slope they descend only to the mean annual tem perature of 37\u00b0. The winter snow-line on the Southern Alps on the east side is 3000 feet, and that on the west side is 3700 feet.\" The population of the provincial district of Canterbury, according to the census of March, 1886, was 121,400 persons, of whom the males were 63,094, and the females 58,306. The aboriginal population within the provincial district in 1886 numbered 647, of whom 313 were females. Canterbury is essentially a pastoral and an agricultural district. On the hills merino sheep are chiefly kept ; elsewhere English breeds of sheep are well represented both in number and quality. Sheep from the best flocks in England have been imported, and much attention has been given to improving the local flocks. The breeding of cattle and horses has also received considerable care. One great advantage which farmers enjoy is that the mildness of winter makes it unnecessary to house or hand feed cattle, to grow green crops for winter supply, or save hay for that purpose. The staple production of the Canterbury plains is grain. The soil is free and easily worked. Double-furrow ploughs are used, and self binding reapers are employed in harvesting. Coal mines are worked at the Malvern Hills, about forty-three miles from Christchurch by rail. The output of coal from those mines during 1887 was 11,681 tons. Stone of good quality for building purposes has been found throughout the"], [275, "253 IND USTRIES\u2014ACCL1MA TISA TION. provincial district. Among the local manufactories, the chief are grain-mills, bacon-curing and meat-preserving works, woollen cloth, boot and clothing factories, breweries, aerated water manufactories, saw-mills and sash and door works, agricultural implement manufactories, fellmonger ing, tanning and wool-scouring establishments, coach building works, brick, tile, and pottery manufactories, and iron and brass foundries. At an International Exhibition held at Christchurch in 1882, among other products of local industry, there were shown a high-pressure engine of 14 horse-power nominal, and several vertical donkey engines with direct acting pump, made in Canterbury ; also a carpet-loom at work. The w-oollen factory established at Kaiapoi, fourteen miles by rail north of Christchurch, got an industrial prize for its exhibits. At that factory, the engine, a horizontal stationary compound engine of 60 horse-power, was made at Christchurch. The intro duction of animals, birds, and fish of other countries has been very successfully effected in Canterbury. The Acclimatisation Society has energetically done its work. A large public reserve has been set apart in the park at Christchurch for the grounds of the Society, where ponds, aviaries, and breeding-places have been established. The spot is a favourite place of public resort. Pheasants, partridges, larks, quail, rooks, jackdaws, blackbirds, thrushes, and many English song-birds have been turned out, and have greatly multiplied. Hares also have been successfully acclimatised, and are numerous. Great atten tion has been given to the introduction of trout and salmon. White fish have also been introduced. As an illustration of the practical bearing of acclimatisation, in some cases, on the progress of colonisation, the instance of the humble-bee may be cited. While white clover spreads luxuriantly, red clover would not seed in New Zealand, owing to the absence of the humble-bee, which is specially fitted by nature to fertilise its flowers. The Acclimatisation Society of Canterbury accordingly ar- ranged for a consignment of humble-bees from England. The germ of the novel industry of ostrich-farming has also been laid in Canterbury. Good work has been done by the Plantation Board of Canterbury in the planting of forest trees. In five years previously to 1884, it had"], [276, "254 CHRISTCHURCH \u2014 CANTERBURY COLLEGE. fenced, ploughed, and sown 1159 acres ; and in the spring of 1886 the work of planting comprised 653 acres. Excellent roads traverse the provincial district in every direction ; and the railway system covers a large extent of country, there being on the 31st of March, 1887, within the provincial district open for traffic, including the main line and the branches, 456 miles of railway. Wool, flour, grain, and coal are the staple industries of the district. Christchurch, the capital of the provincial district of Canterbury, is an inland town, and in early years its communication, both by land and water, with its port, Lyttelton, was difficult and precarious. This serious evil was removed by the enterprise of the early settlers of Canterbury, when, owing mainly to the foresight and energy of Mr. W. S. Moorhouse, the Superintendent of the province, the formation of a tunnel 2838 yards in length through the intervening range of hills, enabled a railway to be opened in 1863 between Christchurch and Lyttelton. Christchurch was built on the treeless plain, but that bareness has long been replaced within and around the town by thick plantations of English and other trees, through which the small river Avon lazily meanders. The population of Christchurch in 1886, exclu- sive of its populous suburbs, was 15,265, and inclusive of those suburbs was 29,655 in number. Christchurch has several fine public buildings and excellent public insti- tutions, among which are included the College, the Normal and High Schools, the Cathedral, the Museum, the Hos- pital, the Lunatic Asylum, the Post-Office, and the Supreme Court. The Canterbury College has a staff of professors, and is valuably endowed. In the year 1887-88 the number of matriculated students was 140, and 70 graduates of the New Zealand University have been educated at this college. The college has the management of the Museum, the Public Library, the School of Agriculture, the School of Art, and the High Schools. The School of Agriculture has been open since 1880, and is situated near the township of Lincoln, about fourteen miles by rail from Christchurch. The object of this school is to afford those intending to look to farming for a livelihood the opportunity of acquir ing a thorough knowledge of the practice and science of agriculture, and, in addition, such a useful and liberal"], [277, "PORT LYTTELTON \u2014 AKAROA. 255 education as would be suitable to their future require ments. The farm attached to the school is 660 acres in extent, and comprises soils of various qualities; it is carried on, as nearly as possible, on economic principles, and in illustration of the teaching of the lecture-room, the students taking part in the regular daily work. The Park in Christchurch, about 440 acres, the Botanical Gardens, and the acclimatisation grounds are laid out with great taste, and are agreeable places of public re creation. The gentle and sinuous stream of the Avon, arched over by w-eeping willows, is much frequented by pleasure-boats. Trams run along the chief streets and suburban roads. Gas is laid on throughout the town, and excellent water is obtained from artesian wells. Villas with velvety lawns, surrounded by pretty gardens and fruitful orchards, plantations, and farms abound in the suburban districts. Port Lyttelton lies on the north-west side of Banks' Peninsula. The town, about five miles from the entrance to the harbour, is built on the steep slopes of hills. The population of Lyttelton in 1886 was 3996 in number. A Sailors' Home has been built at Lyttelton, at a cost of \u00a32500, for the convenience of sailors visiting the port. The harbour is easy of access in most weathers, except in south-west gales, which blow outwards with great violence. The harbour works, which have been almost wholly con structed under the direction of the Lyttelton Harbour Board, have made the port a first-class harbour for vessels of all sizes, for wharfage accommodation, and for loading, discharging, and storing cargoes. A graving dock has been constructed ; its length is 450 feet ; the width at its entrance between the copings is 82 feet, the depth of water on sill is 23 feet, and the width on the floor 46 feet. Communication by steamers and sailing vessels is constant between Lyttelton and other ports in the colony, in Australia, in England, and in foreign countries. The number and tonnage of vessels registered as belonging to Port Lyttelton on the 31st of December, 1886, was 58 sailing vessels, in all 22,911 tons ; and 12 steamers, in all 8567 tons. Akaroa is the largest seaport of Banks' Peninsula, and is one of the finest harbours in New Zealand. It pene-"], [278, "256 AKAROA \u2014 TIM AR U. trates the peninsula in a northerly direction more than eight miles, gives secure and land-locked anchorage to any number of vessels, and is easy of access. A French company established a small settlement in 1840 near the head of the harbour. The chief business of the small town of Akaroa and of the sparse population in the many bays and harbours of the peninsula is the supply of timber, fruit, cheese, and dairy produce. The scenery is romantic and picturesque. Timaru, 100 miles from Christchurch, on the main south line of railway from Christchurch to Dunedin and the Bluff, is a thriving town built close to the seashore. Its population in 1886 was 3754 in number. The ehief industries include meat-preserving works, flour-mills, and agricultural implement manufacture. Timaru is the chief town of South Canterbury, a district rich in agricultural and pastoral wealth. Harbour works of an extensive character are in progress at Timaru. A solid breakwater has been run out, extending 2000 feet from high water mark ; and vessels of 1000 tons register have been en abled to load and unload at wharves constructed under its shelter. The plan contemplates the enclosure of an area of 180 acres of water, with a depth of water ranging from 12 to 23 feet. These works are in course of con struction by the Timaru Harbour Board. The number and tonnage of vessels, other than coasters, entered in wards at Timaru during 1887 was 18 vessels, in all 6409 tons; and of vessels similarly cleared outwards, 21 vessels, in all 8036 tons. A branch railway, 37 miles, runs inland from Washdyke Junction, four miles north of Timaru, to Fairlie's Creek. Further westward lies Lake Tekapo, cradled among high mountains and glistening peaks of snow. Colonising energy has not been at a standstill, even in this wild region. A fine bridge, erected at a cost of \u00a37000, spans the river where it issues from the lake. Beyond, on the utmost verge of civilisation, is seen the broad valley of the Tasman, in the midst of the Southern Alps, where the lofty summit of Mount Cook, ice-bound and clothed in perpetual snow, overtowers the scene. Between the higher and lower ranges in this part of Canterbury, the Lakes Tekapo, Pukaki, and Ohou lie near the bases of Mount Cook, Mount Darwin, and other"], [279, "257 RIVER W AIT AKI\u2014 LAND REGULATIONS. peaks ; and in these ranges are found the great Tasman and Godley glaciers. The river Waitaki is the southern boundary of Canter- bury, dividing it from the provincial district of Otago. That river was for many years the dread of travellers who wished to go overland from one district to the other. The great width of shingle, intersected by deep streams, to be traversed, the swiftness of the current, the icy coldness of the water fed by snow and glacier, and the treacherous bed of moving boulders were formidable dangers, and too often fatal to human life. But for the last fifteen years a railway bridge, a mile long, built on immense iron cylinders, and available for trains, vehicles, \u25a0horses, and pedestrians, has enabled the transit, once so troublesome and perilous, to be made with ease and safety. The chief Land Office of Canterbury is at Christchurch, and there is a local Land Office at Timaru. Rural land, when not reserved from sale, is open for free selection before survey at \u00a32 an acre. Applications in writing are received at the Land Offices, Christchurch and Timaru, and the time at which such application is made is noted thereon. If two or more persons apply simultaneously for the same piece of land, priority is determined by lot when the several applications come on for hearing at the Land Board. The purchase-money being paid, a license to occupy the land described in the application is issued to the purchaser. If the section should be found on survey to contain a greater or lesser area than has been paid for, a further payment is made by the purchaser for the excess, or a refund is made to him of so much of the purchase-money as is represented by the deficiency.

The country available for rent from the Crown as pastoral land is generally open land, most of it hilly, and much of it mountainous. Small areas of good land are in some of the valleys. Provincial District of Westland. The provincial district of Westland extends from the provincial district of Nelson on the north to the pro vincial district of Otago on the south, and is bounded on the east by the watershed of the Southern Alps, and on the west by the ocean. The area of the district of West land is 3,045,760 acres, of which it is estimated in round numbers that 2,844,000 acres are forest land and barren mountain tops, 30,000 acres are rivers and lakes, and 172,000 acres open country. The population in 1886 numbered 15,931, consisting of 9388 males and 6543 females. The district of Westland was part of the original province of Canterbury, and was separated from it in '1867. The country chiefly consists of mountain ranges covered with forest, and the whole district is a gold-field. The climate of Westland is uniform and very healthy. The result of ten years' observations at Hokitika shows a mean annual temperature of 5234\u00b0 ; the dif ference between the coldest and warmest months being 14'76\u00b0. The mean annual rainfall at Hokitika is 112T56 inches. The prevailing wind is westerly ; north-north west winds bring heavy rain on the coast, and south west winds fine, bright weather. In remarking on the climate of Canterbury, I have already drawn attention to the remarkable contrast of temperature and rain on the east and west coasts respectively of the South Island. Westland is, as may .be gathered from what I have said, a mining country, and its pastoral and agricultural sta tistics are comparatively small. The chief centres of population in Westland are Hokitika, Greymouth, Kumara, and Ross. The rivers are the Grey, the Arnold, the Teremakau, the Hoki tika, the Mikonui, the Haast, and others. Westland is a rich alluvial gold-producing district ; its mining is carried on under the hydraulic sluicing system. Ex cluding the gold exported at Greymouth, the chief port of export for the produce of Reefton, which is within the"], [281, "GREYMOUTH \u2014 KUMAR A \u2014 HOKITIKA. 259 Nelson district, the value of gold exported at Hokitika during the year ending March 31st, 1888, was 29,121 ounces, valued at \u00a3116,482. The approximate value of all mining plant employed in Westland, excluding Grey mouth, in March, 1888, was \u00a338,286 ; and the approximate cost of water-races, etc., in operation was estimated at \u00a3131,617. Beginning from the north, the town of Greymouth is at the mouth of, and on the southern bank of the river Grey. Its population in 1886 was 3133 in number, of whom almost half were females. This approximate equality of the two sexes is found in the other towns, Kumara, Hoki tika, and Ross, in Westland, and satisfactorily shows the probable permanence of these centres of a mining popu lation which originally was, on the whole, male and nomadic. The river Grey has a shifting bar, and the navigation is uncertain, but it has been considerably im proved by the extensive harbour works in progress. Grey mouth is in constant communication with other ports by steamers, and overland by tram and coach with Kumara and Hokitika, and by coach and rail with Christchurch. A railway, eight miles, runs from Greymouth to Brunner, where the coal mines are in work, lying within the pro vincial district of Nelson and noticed in my descriptive sketch of that district. A Government railway between Greymouth and Hokitika is in course of construction. The rise of Kumara is a remarkable illustration of the rapid growth of gold-field towns and of the development of wealth by the formation of inland roads. A few months in 1876 changed a lonely tract into a flourishing and populous town, and taught the silent forest to resound with the busy hum of industrial life. In 1886, the popula tion of Kumara numbered 1079 persons. During the year ending March 31st, 1887, the Kumara district produced 13,640 ounces of gold, and there was then every prospect of profitable employment for a large population. Hokitika, the capital of Westland, lies on the north side of the river Hokitika, near its mouth. The popula tion in 1886 was 2687 in number, with a slight excess of females. The bar at the entrance of the river is shifting, but the navigation has been much improved by the con struction of harbour works. The town has steam com-"], [282, "260 ROSS \u2014 MOUNT COOK. munication with other ports ; and there is communication by coach and rail with Christchurch, and by coach and tram with Kumara and Hokitika. As I have said, a rail way is in course of construction between Hokitika and Greymouth, and steps have been taken to connect both places by a transinsular railway to Christchurch. Large and important hydraulic sluicing works are in progress at Humphrey's Gully, a few miles inland from Hokitika. A good coach- road runs from Hokitika southward, 18 miles, to Ross, a small town prettily situated near the sea, and the centre of a considerable mining industry. In this district prospecting and working at alluvial mining far below the surface by the aid of powerful pumping and winding machinery have been undertaken. About the beginning of the year 1887, owing to the great influx of water, pumping was stopped, but it was proposed to place another set of pumps in a new shaft. A good inland bridle road leads from Ross southward, and it extends through the Paringa country to the river Haast and to Jackson's Bay. From the Haast there is good access by a low pass to the settled districts of Otago. The forest extends more or less along the coast, and con tains valuable timber. There are also occasional tracts of open land. The whole country, there is little doubt, has immense stores of undeveloped mineral wealth. Besides gold, coal, galena containing much silver, graphite, and lithographic stone have been found. The scenery towards the south of Westland is indescribably grand, with its ever-changing views of mountains, forests, streams, lakes, and ocean. Mount Cook towers high over the other highest Southern Alps, aud from its eternal snow the glacier descends almost to the level of the sea. Mount Cook, 12,349 feet in height, was for the first time (and, I believe, as yet the only time) ascended in 1883 by the Rev. W. S. Green, a member of the English Alpine Club, and by his two Swiss followers, Ulrich Kaufmann and Emil Boss. A graphic account of this ascent is contained in Mr. Green's \" High Alps of New Zealand.\" The Land Office is at Hokitika.

The whole west coast, from the northern extremity of the South Island to the southern boundary of Westland, is altogether a mining country, between the high mountain range on the east and the ocean on the west, with a few harbours more or less difficult of access \u2014 a country inter sected by rapid and often impassable rivers, covered with dense bush, and, in its natural state, untraversable inland, or even far along the coast. Twenty-five years ago, there were probably not a hundred civilised human beings throughout this vast territory ; and, had it not been for the discovery of gold, generations would probably have passed away before settlement there would have taken root to any great extent. As it is, the population on that coast was, according to the census of 1886, in number 27,477 persons, of whom 10,946 were females. The number of miners employed there in March, 1888, was \u2014 in alluvial mining, Europeans, 3446, and Chinese, 1180 ; in quartz mining, Europeans, 692, and no Chinese ; making a grand total of 5318 miners. The approximate value in March, 1888, of all mining plant, such as machinery, used was \u00a3220,716; and the approximate cost of water-races, tail-races, dams, reservoirs, and ground sluices at the same date was estimated at \u00a3493,527. The quantity of gold produced, often under very adverse circumstances, on that coast, since the first discovery of gold there to the 31st of March, 1888, was 5,054,678 ounces, valued at \u00a320,116,271. Take then the coal mines at work on the coast. The number of men employed in those mines on the 31st of December, 1887, was 682 ; and the total output of coal up to that date since the first working of the mine was, approximately, 1,370,299 tons. It is difficult to grasp the wonderful change which has been made within twenty-five years by the industry and enterprise of this west coast population of settlers, who, it must be borne in mind, came there at their own cost. Description falls far short of the reality. One word more which is applicable to miners throughout the whole colony. It is a mistake to think that disorder and violence exist in mining districts. Whatever might have been the case in the first days of irregular search for gold, when men of"], [284, "262 MINING COMMUNITIES. the worst character came to rob under pretence of mining \u2014 convicts in miners' clothing \u2014 the fact is that wherever a mining community establishes itself, the tendency is towards order and respect for person and property. Other wise, the community would cease to have being. All the surroundings of its occupation call for intelligence, good faith, steadiness, and hard work. Nor is the great virtue of charity absent. Miners liberally contribute to local hospitals and other social institutions, and to relief of misfortune. Many a mining village, in remote spots far from policemen and courts of law, presents a pleasing picture of order, industry, and comfort. I have had occasion more than once in these pages to notice the wonderful adaptation of the North Island in its natural conditions to the work of colonisation. This adaptation is remarkably repeated in the South Island in respect of the natural capabilities of the east and west coasts of Canterbury and Westland conjointly. On the eastern side there are large fertile plains and downs, amply providing for pastoral and agricultural industries. An abundant and overflowing supply of food can easily be raised. And there are harbours which give great faci lities for commerce. The population attracted to the district would chiefly occupy itself in farms and in trade. But (I am now referring to Canterbury) there is absence of mineral ores, coal is not abundant, and there is great scarcity of timber : even the eastern slopes of the dividing range are thinly wooded. On the western coast the country is a great contrast. The land there is rugged and without plain. It is, however, rich in mineral wealth, and its chief industries consist in gold and coal mining. Moreover, it has abundance of valuable timber. In the neighbourhood of Lake Brunner, not far from Greymouth and Hokitika, the finest growth of marketable timber is found, and is said to cover the area of 60,000 acres; and the valleys of the rivers Teremakau, Arnold, Grey, and Hokitika also contain much valuable timber. The western slopes of the dividing range, and the tract in tervening between it and the sea, are almost wholly forest. Evidence was g-iven before a commission in 1883 that the land yielded a maximum of 70,000 feet of timber and an average of 30,000 feet per acre. The commission was of"], [285, "263 EAST AND WEST COASTS. opinion that the quantity of timber, if not wasted, might supply the demand on the east coast for more than one hundred years. The settlers, therefore, on the west coast would form a population chiefly engaged in mining, and able to furnish almost inexhaustible supplies of timber ; but that population would have to depend in a great degree on others for food and necessaries of life in exchange for the products of its industry. And, as the harbours were few and difficult of access, it must look overland for addi tional facilities for trade. At first the mountain barrier which hemmed in that population was apparently an insurmountable obstacle. So far as possible with limited means at command, that obstacle was to some extent overcome soon after the gold discoveries in 1865. A practicable pass was found, and in 1866 the Provincial Government of Canterbury, which then included West land, made a coach-road, 149 miles long, at a cost of \u00a3150,000, between Christchurch and Hokitika. That road was so well made that a four-horse coach has from that time traversed the distance twice a week each way in two days, stopping one night on the route. The scenery among the mountains equals that of the Swiss Alps. The Otira Gorge, about 40 miles from Hokitika, is surpassingly grand. Downward the torrent rushes headlong from the heights, while the road, at one place cut out, as it were, from the overhanging cliff, and at another bridged high above the foaming water, penetrates through the solitary ravine, wbich is walled in by dark mountain sides, streaked here aud there by silvery cascades. This road, great and useful an undertaking as it has been, is evidently not, and could not be, a permanent solution of the problem of colonising the two coasts. It has long been seen that this object could not be thoroughly effected till a railway connecting the main settlements on both sides had been made. Negotiations have been going on for some years between the New Zealand Government and private persons with a view to the formation by a company of a Midland Railway connecting the east and west coasts both at Nelson and at Christchurch. These negotia tions will, I hope, be soon carried into practical effect, under the provisions of \" The Midland Railway Contract Act, 1887.\""], [286, "264 OTAG 0 \u2014 SO UTHLAND. CHAPTER XIII.

Provincial District of Otago. The provincial district of Otago had its beginning in a special settlement originated in 1847 by a body of men belonging to, or sympathizing with, the Free Church of Scotland. The Association, as this body was called, bought from the New Zealand Company a block of 400,000 acres, and the first emigrants arrived in March, 1848. The early settlers encountered great hardships and difficulties, but the energy and perseverance characteristic of their race enabled them to establish themselves successfully iu their new home. The original settlement, gradually peopled from the United Kingdom and the Australian colonies, enlarged its boundaries ; and, in 1853, Otago became, under the Constitution Act of the preceding year, a province comprising all the South Island to the south of the river Waitaki. In 1861, the province of Southland, a southern portion of Otago, was made a separate province, but in 1870 it was reunited to Otago, and is now part of that provincial district. Otago comprises all the island south of Canterbury and Westland, and also comprises Stewart Island and the adjacent islands. The area of the whole district contains 16,038,400 acres, of which about 9,000,000 acres are estimated to be fitted for agricultural purposes, and about 1,500,000 acres are forest lands. From the river Waitaki, the northern boundary, to Dunedin, the capital of the district, a distance of about 80 miles, and from the coast inland, an average breadth of 40 miles,"], [287, "265 CO UNTR Y \u2014 RIVERS. the land consists of large plains and downs with a few hill ranges. Further in the interior are magnificent plains and smaller fertile valleys. South of Dunedin, from the vicinity of the town to the river Clutha and thence to the river Mataura, plains extend, about 120 miles in length, with a breadth varying from 10 to 40 miles, flanked on either side by hills of no great height with long rounded or flat-topped spurs and fertile sloping gullies. South of the river Mataura to the ocean and west to the river Wairau, a distance in each direction of about 60 miles, the country is mostly level, with hills here and there of moderate height. This country, which is well watered, is admirably situated for agricultural and pastoral pursuits ; and the possession of large adjacent forests, and of patches of forest scattered over the country, supplying timber available for building and fencing, conduces much towards the progress of settlement. The interior, in which the gold-fields chiefly lie, is generally mountainous and broken, but with excellent natural grasses for depasturing the flocks and herds of the settlers. There are, moreover, some fine straths and plains available for agriculture. Roads and railways have brought within easy reach large tracts of inland forests ; and the greater part of the western seaboard is dense bush of valuable timber. Otago is abundantly watered ; its chief rivers, which discharge themselves on the east and south coasts, are comparatively very long and large ; some of them are navigable for many miles by small craft. The Clutha, having its source north of Lake Wanaka, is above 200 miles long, and is estimated to discharge 1,088,700 cubic feet of water every minute; it has several tributaries. This river, whose volume of water is four times larger than that of the Tay, ten times than that of the Thames, may be called the Pactolus of the province. From the first discovery, gold has been found in large quantities for scores of miles on its banks and beaches. The Taieri slowly and snake-like wends its way through the Taieri plain, making a course of about 150 miles in a direct distance, of about 45 miles as the crow flies. The Mataura is about 120 miles long ; the Oreti, 130 ; and the Waiau and Mararoa, which drain Lakes Manipori and Te Anau, about 140 miles. The Wai taki, dividing Otago from Canterbury, is about 130 miles"], [288, "266 LAKES\u2014 SOUNDS. long. The chief lakes in Otago are Lakes Wanaka and Hawea in the north, and Lakes Wakatipu and Te Anau, southward of them. Lake Wanaka has an area of 75 square miles ; Lake Hawea, 48 ; Lake Wakatipu, 112 ; and Te Anau, 132 square miles. This group of lakes roman tically situated amid Alpine scenery can be easily reached either from Dunedin or lnvercargill. The mountain ranges run generally from north to south ; the watershed between the east and west coasts lies near the west coast. The chief peaks are Mount Aspiring, 9000 feet ; Mount Earn slaw, 9200 feet; Mount Castor and Pollux, 8600 feet; and Ben Nevis, 7600 feet in height. The range in Western Otago presses closely on the coast, and is penetrated in various places by long winding sounds, or fiords, of great depth. Nature here asserts her predominant sway, and scarcely any trace of man, except in the occasional visit of a steamer or an exploring or scaling party, is seen. The still, deep waters, walled in by stupendous mountains, rising in places almost precipitously 5000 or 6000 feet high, the silence only broken here and there by roaring cataracts, and the utter loneliness of all around, invest these remote scenes with inexpressible grandeur. On this part of the coast, in a distance along it of 120 miles, thirteen of these sounds, or fiords, run inland, some for 20 miles. Milford Sound, the northernmost, though less in extent than the others, far surpasses them all in its grand scenery. Pembroke Peak, about three miles inland, lifts its summit of perpetual snow on the northern side to a height of 6700 feet, and Llawrenny Peaks, a very remarkable saddle-back mountain, is of nearly the same height on the southern side ; while the Mitre rises abruptly 5560 feet immediately over the south side of the sound, and a dome-shaped mountain, nearly bare of vegetation, and resembling from its peculiar hue a monster mass of metal, is on the opposite shore. From Anita Bay the sound runs south-east for a mile and a half, when the narrow entrance is reached, barely exceeding a quarter of a mile in width, with towering perpendicular cliffs on either side, and with soundings in mid-channel of 60 fathoms. The sound then trends in an easterly and south east direction for six miles between gigantic cliffs, the width varying from one-third to three-quarters of a mile."], [289, "267 MILFORD SOUND. The depth at one place is 214 fathoms. The following extract from a description given of this sound by the Rev. W. S. Green, who, as I have stated, successfully ascended Mount Cook in 1883, is taken from his \" High Alps of New Zealand \" -.\u2014 \" Vertical cliffs rose for thousands of feet on either hand, and we drove in before a blast so strong as almost to make steaming unnecessary. The surface of the sea would now and then be torn off in sheets, driven along in spin drift, and again all would be calm as glass. Waterfalls, resembling the Staubach, came down the cliffs from far above the clouds, and were blown away into spray, while in mid-air, by the fury of the storm. Wherever vegetation could get a footing on these immense precipices lovely tree-ferns and darker shrubs grew in profusion, all dripping with moisture, and running up the cliffs in long strips of verdure till lost to our view aloft in the torn white mists. The vivid green of the foliage was the feature of all this wondrous scene which struck me most. Two or three miles up the sound we steamed close to an immense water fall which, in one plunge of 300 feet, leaped into the sound with a roar like thunder, drowning our voices and sending great gushes of spray over the steamer's deck. The face of another cliff was so draped with numberless small falls that it seemed to be covered with a veil of silver gauze about 300 yards in width. While passing along here we fired a gun. Echo after echo resounded from cliff to cliff, and from invisible crags high over our heads the echo again returned as a voice from the clouds. The mist now showed an inclination to clear off, the rain ceased, and as we entered the inner basin of the sound the forests in creased in beauty. The Totara pines, draped with festoons of grey lichen, contrasted well with the soft green of the great fern fronds, and formed a suitable background to the scarlet blossoms of the Rata (Metrosideros lucida), which here and there lit up the upper surface of the forest with patches of intense colour. Gleams of sunshine began to dart through the clouds, giving a momentary flash on one of the numerous cascades, and then, passing over forest and cliff, added new beauties of light and shade. When about eight miles from the open sea, a booming sound rose higher over the voices of the numerous cascades, growing"], [290, "268 LAKES ANAU AND MANAPOURI. louder as we advanced, and rounding a forest-clad point we came upon the grandest of New Zealand waterfalls, the great Bowen Fall. Its first fall is only about 50 feet into a rocky basin, but leaping from it upwards and out wards in a wonderful curve, it plunges down with a deafening roar in a single leap of 300 feet.\" Although the tract of land dividing these wonderful sounds from the picturesque south-western lakes is narrow, being in places only about ten miles in width, the dense forests and rugged mountains, of which it consists, pre clude, at present, overland access from the one to the other. The importance of providing reasonable facilities for this access is urged in a memorandum, dated May 5th, 1887, and printed as a Parliamentary paper, from the Hon. J. C. Richmond, a member of the Legislative Council, to Sir Robert Stout, then Premier of New Zealand. Mr. Richmond, who is himself an excellent artist, visited, in company with Mr. J. Gully, the well-known landscape painter, the Lakes Anau and Manapouri, and he states that the impression they both received of the singular beauty of the district made it his duty to recall atten tion to its attractiveness and to that of the neigh bouring ocean sounds as a field for the tourist. Mr. Rich mond states that the distance, as the crow flies, from the south-west arm of Te Anau to the head of George Sound, and from the north-western arm of North Manapouri to the head of Bradshaw Sound, is in each case under ten miles, and that the watershed of neither at those points is likely to exceed the height of 3500 feet above the sea. He points out that, at a moderate cost, all the unique scenery of the south-west coast could be brought within the limits of one moderate summer tour. Of the two lakes, Te Anau and Manapouri, which are not as yet much frequented, Mr. Richmond says each has its own special attractions. Te Anau is a noble and cheerful expanse of water. Fiords branch out in several places. On the west, wooded mountains, about 4000 feet high, their continuity being broken by three great fiords, hem the lake in, and parts of it are overhung by the higher mountains, the highest being at its northernmost extremity. Manapouri, he thinks, will be more attractive to the majority of visitors, from its labyrinthine arms, fantastic"], [291, "269 LAKE WAKATIPU. islets and promontories, the surprises of its coves and bends, its variety of peaks, and the noble range of the Cathedral Peaks, its transparent waters and white beaches, and by the copious outflow of the fine river Waiau. Mr. Richmond adds that \" those even who have revelled in the beauties of the lakes of Switzerland, Savoy, and Italy, with their peaks glittering with snow and creeping glaciers, their shores adorned with white towns and towers, their histories, legends, and memories, will be dull people if they feel no new delight in these lonely waters, destitute of history and of remnants of the past except the stone tools and weapons and the few bones and skulls of a consider able Maori population, which within the present century lived on the level parts of their shores.\" Mr. Richmond does not describe Lake Wakatipu and Milford Sound and the other ocean sounds, which, he says, have already a reputation outside the colony. I have already referred to Milford Sound (the type of the others), and I have only a few words to say about Lake Wakatipu. It is more than sixty miles long, and of great depth. The scenery, especially at the head of it, is extremely fine, and the only lake in Europe which can equal it is Lucerne. The view in going towards the head of the lake from Queenstown is magnificent. Alps rearing their snow summits to the skies are seen on every side, while, in the distance, o'ertopping all, the double peak of Mount Earn slaw, clothed in perennial ice and snow, glitters through the fleecy clouds which partly veil its stupendous height. Mr. Richmond, in concluding his valuable communica tion, writes with great truth and foresight as follows : \u2014 \" It is needless to dwell long on the value of such an asset as now lies dormant in the districts referred to. It is enough to name the example of Switzerland, where for four months of the year the five great nations of Europe and the United States of America pour their contingents over the land, filling the railway trains and hotels, and consuming on the spot all the surplus produc tions of the land, employing an army of labourers of all kinds. Though our land is less attractive, and its neighbours less populous, yet, on the other hand, New Zealand has a monopoly of attractions of this kind in the southern latitudes ; and during the summer in Australia"], [292, "270 CLIMA TE \u2014 IND USTRIES. our\" moderate climate invites her population at the season most favourable for enjoying our mountains and lakes. There is great force in the foregoing observations, and there is no doubt that in public administration in New Zealand the great importance of encouraging the tourist element as a powerful factor in the colonisation of a new country has not been adequately appreciated. The climate of Otago is bracing and healthy. The result of seventeen years' observation at Dunedin, 550 feet above the sea, gives the mean temperature of the year as 50' 72\u00b0; the difference of the temperature of the coldest and warmest months being 16'92\u00b0. At Queenstown, on Lake Wakatipu, 1070 feet above the sea, the result of three years' observation gives the mean temperature of the year as 51'01\u00b0 ; and the difference between the coldest and warmest months as 21'25\u00b0. At Invercargill, the southern extremity of the district, and on the sea-level, the result of fourteen years' observation gives the mean temperature of the year as 50'36\u00b0 ; and the difference between the coldest and warmest months as 16'92\". The mean annual rainfall at Dunedin is 32-019 inches ; and in Southland, 43'674 inches. The prevailing winds on the southern coasts of New Zealand are from north-west to south-west, and through Foveaux Strait they often blow with great violence. In the extreme south-west of Otago, during the winter, thunderstorms are very frequent. The population of Otago in 1886 was 149,154 persons : males, 80,8.34 ; and females, 68,320. The staple industries of Otago are wool, grain, frozen meat, gold, and coal. Other local industries include agricultural implement manufactories, coach-building, ship and boat-building, woollen factories, boot and shoe factories, clothing factories, furniture factories, cheese and butter factories, fish curing and preserving works, malt-houses, breweries, aerated water and cordial manu factories, grain-mills, saw-mills ; brick, tile, and pottery works ; fellmongering, tanning, and wool-scouring estab lishments ; iron and brass foundries, and fisheries. Otago is famous for her industrial excellence in working in metals, in woollen cloth, and in clothing manufacture. There are also two mills for the manufacture of paper, one at Dunedin, and one at Mataura. A mill also for the"], [293, "IND USTRIES\u2014 G OLD. 271 manufacture of blasting powder has been established. Small steamers have been built at Dunedin, and also iron steam dredgers with engines, and heavy cranes. The largest steam dredger was 70 horse-power ; and a 40-ton travelling jib-crane was built for the harbour works at Oamaru. Land engines of all sizes are made for mills, mines, and other purposes. At a quartz-mill in the district of Wakatipu, twenty head of stampers are driven by electricity engendered by the force of a stream nearly two miles away, and [conveyed over an intervening range, 800 feet high, by a No. 8 copper wire. This successful application of electric power is the more interesting when it is remembered what an abundant supply of water power is almost everywhere obtainable throughout New Zealand. Cast-steel works to convert scrap iron are in progress at Green Island, near Dunedin. Building stone is abundant in Otago. Port Chalmers stone is good and easily worked, and the supply is practically unlimited. The white granular variety of freestone of which the Oamaru stone is the type exists in immense quantities right across Southland, and all along the front range from the Kakanui in Otago northwards. A quarry of marble has been opened at Caswell Sound. Roofing slate, equal in quality to the Welsh, is found in the Kakanui range ; and large deposits of limestone of the hydraulic kinds which make the best mortar are on the Otago peninsula. Iron, copper, manganese, antimony ores, oil shales, and graphite are also found in Otago. Creosoting works for preserving the less durable woods are in full operation at Invercargill. Stock, grain, gold, and coal are, in Otago, the chief elements of industrial wealth ; they are, if I may say so, its \" Great Quadrilateral.\" Gold, for all practical purposes, was first found in Otago in 1861. The total quantity of gold produced in the district up to the 31st of March, 1888, was 4,608,755 ounces, valued at \u00a318,185,037. The quantity produced during the year ending March 31st, 1888, was 61,478 ounces, valued at \u00a3244,021. Quartz mines exist in Otago in the schistose rocks, and they occur at all heights, from sea-level to a height of 7400 feet. The most elevated mine in the Australasian colonies was opened in Otago,"], [294, "272 GOLD \u2014 COAL. in 1878, on the summit of Advance Peak, near Lake Wakatipu. The Otago gold-fields are at Tuapeka, Naseby, St. Bathan's, Opbir, Clarke's, Tinker's, Bannockburn, Shotover, Waikaia, Orepuke, and other places in the district. The lands in the whole district containing auriferous gravel drifts and gold-bearing quartz reefs comprise an area of about 9000 square miles. The pro portion of labour employed in alluvial mining, compared with that employed in quartz-mining, is as 9 to 1. The approximate value of machinery, according to the latest return in 1888, used in alluvial and quartz mining in Otago is estimated at \u00a3126,500 sterling. The approximate cost of water-races, tail-races, etc., etc., at the same time was estimated at nearly half a million. Coal mines are extensively worked in Otago. Pitch coal has been worked at Shag Point, 40 miles north of Dunedin, since 1862, together with brown coal. It belongs to the Upper Cretaceous period, and has an evaporative power of 5*2 lb. Brown coal is found abundantly in the Kaitangata mine, in the Clutha district of Otago. Sir James Hector, the director of the Geological Survey in New Zealand, states, in his Handbook of 1886, that the area of this latter coalfield is about 6000 acres, and that the quantity of coal has been estimated from surveys to be 140,000,000 tons, nearly the whole of which would be available without sinking. He adds that in the same provincial district (Otago), thick seams of brown coal in grits and clay-shale have been worked since 1861 at Green Island and Saddle Hill, and extensive seams exist in Southland and to the west of Riverton, which have not yet been regularly mined. It belongs to the age of the Upper Greensand, and has an average evaporative power of 4'2 lb. to 5'6 lb. The lignites of Lower Miocene age, he writes, occur in the interior of Otago and at other places in superficial deposits of limited extent, and have been used chiefly by gold-miners. The approximate total output of coal in the whole provincial district up to the 31st of December, 1887, was 1,678,446 tons. The output during 1887 was 164,076 tons, being an increase of 6630 tons over that of the preceding year. The total value of the chief products of the provincial district of Otago exported during the year 1887 was"], [295, "273 PRODUCTS \u2014 PORT CHALMERS \u2014 DUNEDIN. as follows : \u2014 Wool, \u00a3929,875 ; animals and produce, exclusive of wool, \u00a3339,004 ; flour and grain, \u00a3464,688 ; gold, \u00a3279,518 ; timber, \u00a3128,857 ; fisheries, \u00a33514 ; and manufactures, \u00a310,963. Dunedin, the capital of the provincial district of Otago, is on the east coast, a little to the northward of 46\u00b0 south latitude, at the head of a sheet of water extending about eight miles from Port Chalmers, which is about seven miles within the heads of the harbour. The population of Port Chalmers, in 1886, numbered 2235 persons. There is excellent accommodation at Port Chalmers for loading and unloading large vessels, and there is also a graving dock, 328 feet long, 68 feet wide at the top, and 41 feet at the bottom. The gate is 50 feet wide, and the depth of water on the sill is in ordinary tides 19| feet. In connection with this dock there are large workshops and powerful machinery, including a steam hammer. There is also a floating dock, 170 feet long and 42 feet broad. A railway, eight miles long, connects Port Chalmers and Dunedin. Extensive harbour works are in progress, under the conduct of the Otago Harbour Board, for the improve ment of the harbour, for deepening the bar, for reclaiming land, and for other purposes connected with navigation. Vessels of considerable size now go up to the wharves at Dunedin. The number and tonnage of vessels registered and belonging to the port at Dunedin on the 31st of December, 1886, was \u2014 sailing vessels, 53, with an aggre gate tonnage of 8129 tons ; and steamers, 45, with an aggregate tonnage of 19,509 tons. Thirty-five of the steamers were above 50 tons each. A seamen's union has been established at Port Chalmers ; its object is to protect the rights and privileges of seamen ; and the committee are authorised to give money to the members of the union in case of distress or shipwreck. Dunedin is essentially a fine city. The substantial nature of its buildings, the number of handsome edifices, its curbed and asphalted pavements, its metalled and well-drained streets, the throng of its population, and the bustle of its commercial activity give it the appearance of an old-established town. A description of it cannot be properly understood unless the city and the suburbs are described together ; and, in fact, Dunedin, Dunedin South, T"], [296, "274 D UNEDIN \u2014 INSTITUTIONS. St. Kilda, Maori Hill, Mornington, Caversham, Roslyn, West Harbour, and North\u00c6ast Valley, though they may he in convenient divisions for municipal self-government, practically constitute one city. Dunedin, thus considered, stretches along the head of a bay, and rises upwards nearly to the top of the encircling ridge. Many of the dwelling-houses are built high up, and peep picturesquely out of the surrounding foliage. The views of Dunedin from the water and from the hills are beautiful. The length of Princes Street and George Street, together, is more than two miles ; and, from east to west, High Street is about one mile. A belt of 560 acres is set apart, around the outer boundaries of the city landward, for public recreation. The population of the city in 1886, inclusive of the suburbs, was 45,518 persons. The public build ings are handsome and numerous ; among them are the Post-Office, the Custom-House, the Garrison Hall, the Hospital, the Museum, the University, the High School, and the Town Hall. There are fine hotels and private residences, and very creditable buildings for commercial, social, and charitable purposes. A good supply of gas and water is laid through all the streets and in the houses. Trams run through the main streets, and special lines, worked by fixed engines and wire ropes, are used for the steep ascents to the suburbs of Roslyn and Mornington. The Botanic Gardens and the adjacent Acclimatisation Grounds are at the north end of the city. The garden is well laid out, and has fine specimens of imported trees and a valuable nursery for plants and trees. A drive runs through the Town Belt, and gives in many spots charming views of the city and the harbour. The ocean beach, easily accessible from Dunedin, has a fine stretch of level sand, and is a pleasant and much-frequented resort of the citizens. There are excellent institutions for liberal, technical, and other scientific education. Besides primary schools, there are two High Schools, one for boys and one for girls ; and there is the University of Otago. The University of Otago is valuably endowed and has a staff of professors. It affords academical education in all its branches, and contains a faculty of arts, a school of medicine, a school \u00bbf law, and a school of mines. A chair of natural philo-"], [297, "275 UNIVERSITY \u2014 HOSPITAL. sophy has been recently added. The University session, which commenced in May, 1887, is stated in the Chan cellor's report, dated April 30th, 1888, to have been attended by 99 students, who had matriculated. Referring to the death, during the preceding year, of Mr. James Macandrew, who was the chief founder of the Univer sity, it is stated that his friends and admirers have estab lished a scholarship for the promotion of the science of political economy. The report adds, on good authority, that the University of Otago has been recognised by the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons as fulfilling the necessary requirements in regard to professional study for the diplomas of the two colleges. The library of the University has several thou sand books specially selected by the professors for the use of students, and it is also open to the public, on certain conditions, as a library of reference. There is also an excellent chemical laboratory in the University. The Museum, which is under the management of the Univer sity, has large and well-arranged collections representing the different departments of science and natural history. Several important additions had been made during 1886 and 1887 to the collections in the Museum; and the greater portion of the collection illustrative of New Zealand zoology sent to the Colonial and Indian Exhibi tion in London had been purchased by the trustees of the British Museum for the Natural History Museum, South Kensington. The biological classes and the Otago In stitute have accommodation in the Museum building at Dunedin. A very complete operating theatre is being built at the Dunedin Hospital, partly in the interests of the Medical School. Among the charitable institutions may be mentioned the Dunedin Hospital, which has 150 beds. The Colonial Inspector- General of Hospitals, Dr. Macgregor, in his report dated 30th of May, 1887, states that this hospital stands pre-eminent in the colony for the admirable completeness of its arrangements for the medical and surgical treatment of the patients, and that, \" although the building is inferior to several of the other hospitals, from the fact that it was not designed originally for its present purpose, yet the advantage it possesses from its"], [298, "276 IND US TRIES \u2014 INVER CAR GILL. connection with the thriving and vigorous Medical School of Dunedin gives it in all the essentials of hospital treat ment and management an unmistakable superiority.\" There are also at Dunedin the Otago Benevolent Institu tion, for the relief of women and children left friendless and destitute ; the Otago Industrial School, for neglected and criminal children ; and the Patients' and Prisoners' Aid Society, the object of which is to administer religious teaching to the inmates of the hospital, lunatic asylum, and gaol, and to aid persons discharged from those establishments. The lunatic asylum is at Seacliffe, in Blueskin Bay, 24 miles by rail from Dunedin. Among the chief local industries in Dunedin and its neighbourhood are ironworks, furniture-making, coach building, woollen and clothing factories, tanneries, breweries, boot and shoe making, chemical works, and meat refrigeration. The agricultural district immediately around Dunedin is small, but the Taieri Plains, a few miles south of Dunedin, comprise an extensive tract of fertile land with soil of rich alluvial deposit, and this tract is mostly occupied by farms. Mosgeil, where the well-known Mosgeil Woollen Factory has been established since 1871, is at the head of the Taieri Plains, about ten miles from Dunedin by rail. lnvercargill, the capital of Southland when Southland was a separate province, is situated on the plains of the Bluff, eight miles within the entrance of New River, on the eastern margin of an extensive shoal estuary. It is 139 miles by rail from Dunedin, and 17 miles by rail from the Bluff Harbour. A railway also goes north 87 miles to Kingston, at the southern end of Lake Wakatipu. It will be convenient to consider lnvercargill and its suburbs, as in the case of Dunedin, as one city. The population, thus considered, was, in 1886, in number 8939 persons. The town is well laid out, the chief streets are wide, and some of the buildings are lofty and sub stantial. There are in it many public and social institu tions. The town is the centre of a large and fertile agricultural and pastoral district, and has also a consider able timber trade. Other industries are flour-mills, fellmongering, wool-scouring, tanning, and boot and shoe making. lnvercargill has two shipping ports \u2014 the New"], [299, "STEWART ISLAND \u2014 ACCLIMATISATION. 277 River, which is close to the town, and the Bluff, which, as I have stated, is seventeen miles distant by rail. Com pared with the Bluff Harbour as a port for shipping, New River has the advantage of water access to the interior, but it has a bar, while the Bluff is a better port, is with out a bar, and is accessible to vessels of any tonnage. The Bluff Harbour, at which there is good wharfage for large vessels, is a port of considerable importance, as the last place of departure and the first port of arrival for steamers which are constantly running between New Zealand and Melbourne in Australia. Stewart Island is south of the Bluff, and is separated from the main shore by Foveaux Strait, about 15 miles in general width. Its area is 459,162 acres. This island, which has on its eastern and south-east sides several excellent harbours, is of irregular three-sided shape ; its western or longest side runs north and south 39 miles, its north-east and south-east sides are respectively about 33 and 30 miles in length, and its greatest breadth is little more than 20 miles. An irregular ridge of mountains, of which the highest is 3200 feet above the sea, runs east and west along the north coast of the island. The island is generally mountainous, and thickly wooded with valuable timber. The European population in the island in 1886 was 209 persons, of whom 81 were females. The natives in the island in 1886 numbered 135, of whom 60 were females. Timber, fish, and oysters abound in and around Stewart Island. Parts of the island are well adapted for building boats and small craft, and there is abundance of timber suitable for that industry. There are trees suitable for masts and spars, and good timber for planking, deck-beams, and fittings. Seals frequent the shores of the island. Excellent roads traverse the provincial district of Otago in every direction, and an unbridged river along a line of road is exceptional. The railway system, also, within the district is comprehensive. About 570 miles of railway were open for traffic on the 31st of March, 1887. The main line from the river Waitaki, the northern boundary of Otago, to the Bluff Harbour, its southern extremity, is 248 miles long. The Otago Central Line, 182 miles, connecting Dunedin through the central interior with"], [300, "278 A CCLIMA TISA TION\u2014LA ND REGULA TIONS. Lake Hawea, is in process of construction. The first section, about 30 miles, is open for traffic (May, 1888). Much has been done for acclimatisation in the provincial district of Otago. Societies in Otago and in Southland, when they were separate provinces, strenuously worked in the furtherance of this object. The rivers have been stocked with trout, successfully hatched from imported ova ; and great attention has been directed to a similar course with respect to English and Californian salmon (but with what success in the case of salmon I am not able to say). Sea-trout, American white fish, and other edible fish have been successfully introduced. Pheasants, partridge and quail, English songsters, Australian minahs and plovers, deer and hares, have also been imported and set free. Trees and plants of various kinds have been largely grown from imported seeds, and have been liberally distributed. These societies and their successors and those kindred to them in other parts of New Zealand, formed and maintained by voluntary efforts alone, and zealously devoting themselves, without stint of trouble and cost, to the work of acclimatisation, deserve the greatest credit for their services. The chief Land Office is at Dunedin ; there are local Land Offices at Clyde, Lawrence, Naseby, Queenstown, and Waikaia. Southland is a separate land district, and the chief Land Office is at lnvercargill, and there is a local Land Office at Riverton. In the land district of Otago rural lands are held mostly under pastoral lease, and are not open for sale. Those rural lands which are not leased or reserved are in hundreds or special blocks, and are open for application at the price of \u00a31 an acre. In the event of two or more applications for the same land on the same day, it is put up to public auction and sold to the highest bidder. Land is usually surveyed before being offered for application, but it may also be offered for free selection before survey. A \" hundred \" is simply the term applied to a block of land proclaimed by the Governor as open for settlement. Should the hundred be taken from country land under pastoral lease, it must not exceed 20,000 acres in extent ; and one-third at least must be agricultural land. If the hundred is declared on land not under lease, there is no restriction either as to size"], [301, "279 LAND REGULATIONS \u2014 CHATHAM ISLANDS. of block or quality of land. Purchasers in a hundred have the exclusive privilege of grazing stock over the unsold portion of the hundred. The exercise of this privilege is regulated according to acreage held by the purchaser ; and the regulations are made by Wardens, who are elected by and from among the purchasers them selves. Rural land may be sold by auction if declared of special value, in which case the upset price must be more than \u00a31 per acre. Town lands are sold by auction at intervals of three to six months, of which thirty days' notice is given by advertisement. Application for the purchase of land for cash or on deferred payments may be made at any of these Land Offices. Applications for agricultural leases have to be made generally at the nearest Gold-fields Warden's office. The Wardens' offices are at Dunedin, Naseby, Clyde, Queenstown, Arrowtown, Lawrence, Switzer's, and Riverton. Information relating to each local land district only is obtainable at the local offices. In the land district of Southland, all rural land was classified by commissioners as agricultural and pastoral. That classed as agricultural has, for the most part, been set aside or reserved for deferred payments, and is offered for sale when surveyed into suitable allotments. The balance of land classed as agricultural is open for free selection before survey at the rate of \u00a32 per acre ; that classified as pastoral is open for free selection before survey at \u00a31 per acre. All unsold lands within the hun dreds that have not been reserved for deferred payments or other purposes are also open for application at \u00a31 per acre. The greater portion of pastoral land is at present leased for grazing purposes, subject, however, to the right of any applicant to apply, prior to survey, for any piece or pieces of land he may desire. The price of deferred payment land ranges from \u00a31 to \u00a32 per acre after survey ; that for land open on the cash or free- selection system having been stated above. The Chatham Islands. The Chatham Islands which are within the limits of the colony, though not included within any provincial"], [302, "280 CHATHAM ISLANDS\u2014 AUCKLAND ISLANDS. district, consist of one main and two much smaller islands, about 365 miles eastward of Cape Palliser, Cook Strait. The main island, from which the group derives its name, extends west-south-west and east-north-east about 38 miles, and from north to south 25 miles, and has a coast line deeply indented by large bays. The surface in the northern half of the island is generally undulating and marshy, and there are several lakes, mostly surrounded by sloping hills. Waitangi Harbour, about the centre of the island, is the chief inhabited place. The larger and better part of the island is that to the southward of Waitangi ; it is undulating and less boggy, and is partly covered with open woods of mode rately sized trees, or with high fern. Pitt Island, a little to the southward of the main island, is thickly wooded, and its soil is very fertile. Both in Chatham Island and Pitt Island European fruits grow and thrive, and supplies of fresh meat, vegetables, and dairy produce can be ob tained. The European population in 1886 was 199 in number : males, 106, and females, 93. The aboriginal inhabitants of these islands are called \"Moriori,\" and it is believed that before the year 1830 they were nearly exterminated by a Maori tribe which made an expedition from the mainland in New Zealand, and which conquered and occupied the islands for nearly twenty years, and then mostly returned to their old home. According to the census of 1886, the number of Maoris living in the Chatham Islands were 159, of whom 75 were females ; and the number of Morioris there was 36, of whom 17 were females. The main industry at the Chatham Islands is pastoral. The Auckland Islands. The Auckland Islands, which are uninhabited, are within the limits of the colony, lying to the south of New Zealand between the parallels of about 50\u00b0 30' and 51\u00b0 south, and the meridians of 165\u00b0 and 166\u00b0 15' east. This group consists of one large and several smaller islands, separated by narrow channels, and extending over a space of about 30 miles in length north and south, by nearly 15 miles in breadth. The land is mountainous, and covered with dense thickets of low trees. The climate is boister-"], [303, "281 AUCKLAND ISLANDS. ous, and the gales, chiefly from the north-west, are violent and of long duration. There are several harbours ; and depots of provisions have been established in some of them, and are, from time to time, renewed for the relief of shipwrecked persons. An attempt to colonise these islands in 1847, in connection with whale fisheries, failed, and has never been repeated."], [304, "282 INTENDING EMIGRANTS. CHAPTER XIV. New Zealand \u2014 Intending emigrants \u2014 Chief exports \u2014 Industrial Ex- hibition at Wellington \u2014 Keports on chief New Zealand exhibits at Colonial and Indian Exhibition at London in 1886. The descriptive sketches, slight and imperfect as they are which I have already given of the principal features of the several provincial districts, the component parts of the colony, aggregately represent the existing state of the colony as a whole. It is only, therefore, necessary for me now to try to place before my readers a general summary of the condition of the whole colony in some of its leading social and industrial branches. In that way, I hope that New Zealand, as it is, may he more vividly pictured. Upon consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the more convenient mode of making this attempt will be to embody it in the shape of a statistical memorandum, which I insert in the Appendix,* giving here only more general observations on the subject. A few words of caution to intending emigrants may not here be out of place. The success of the settler materially depends on the right choice of his settlement. It is, as a rule, futile to tell an intending emigrant whereabouts in New Zealand he ought to go, and what he ought to do when he arrives. Much must depend on the character, capability, and cir cumstances of the individual himself. He should en deavour to obtain accurate information with regard to the different settlements, and he should then to a great extent use his own judgment. Let not any one think that, with out trouble, without risk, and without special qualifica tions, he can secure a fortune, or even earn a livelihood, * Appendix C."], [305, "INTENDING EMIGRANTS\u2014 POPULATION. 283 by merely going out to New Zealand ; or that any letters of introduction will provide for him public, or private, employment. Expectations of this kind almost always end in bitter disappointment. An emigrant should have a trade, or a profession, or capital. If he is not a capitalist, he must do hard work with his hands, or with his brains. If he has capital, he must take care not to waste it, or to lose it in unsuccessful ventures. Most espe cially, New Zealand is not a place for relieving families in the United Kingdom, or elsewhere, from \"poor rela tions \" of idle and dissipated habits. Emigrants of that class will probably sink to lower depths of degradation, inasmuch as in a new country they are less likely to find restraining influences to check their downward course. Every district in New Zealand offers great advantages to capable and honest work, and to the remunerative invest ment of capital, even of very small amount, in suitable industries. No country can, I believe, show, in propor tion to its population, more instances of persons rising, by means of honest industry and thrift, from poverty to com parative wealth, and of themselves and their children attaining high positions in the State. Intending settlers who wish to invest capital ought to act with prudence, and take no definite step w-ithout previous careful inquiry and personal observation. To men of independent means who reside in New Zealand there are great attractions. The healthy climate, the picturesque scenery, the refine ment and culture to be found in the society, the many appliances of modern civilisation, the facilities for obtain ing high class education for the young, the opportunities for distinction in political life, and the peculiar charms of a new country, all contribute to the enjoyment of that class of colonists. The population, exclusive of Maoris, in New Zealand, according to the census of March, 1886, was 578,482 in number: males, 312,221, and females, 266,261. The number on the 31st of December, 1887, as estimated by the Registrar-General, was 645,330. The Maori census of 1886 gives 41,969 Maoris, of whom 22,840 were males, and 19,129 females. I shall now shortly advert to the existing industrial and social condition of New Zealand."], [306, "284 WOOLS. Wool is, undoubtedly, the most important production of New Zealand, and is divisible into two classes, namely, combing wool and clothing wool, from which are pro duced the two leading kinds of manufacture in the cloth trade, worsted and woollen goods. The first comprises the long-stapled wools of the Lincoln, Leicester, Cotswold, and Romney Marsh breeds of English sheep. This class of wool is required for worsted goods, and, when combed, for bombazines, camlet, etc. ; and the soil and climate of New Zealand are very suitable for its production. The long-woolled sheep of Great Britain improve by the change ; the length of the wool is increased, and all its valuable properties preserved, owing doubtless to the genial climate, and absence of exposure to the extremes of an English temperature. The Leicester breed has received great attention in New Zealand, and is the favourite with the Auckland sheep-farmers. The Cots wold is a wool very similar to the Leicester, but of a somewhat deeper and harsher character, and lacks the \"lustre \" so much in demand for certain classes of manu factured goods. The Cotswold appears quite as much in favour with the New Zealand breeder as the Leicester, and probably its habits and character are more generally adapted to the climate of the South Island and the moun tain pastures of the colony, than any other long-woolled sheep. The Cotswold bears exposure better than the Lin coln or Leicester, will live and thrive on poor land, and come to more weight of carcase than any other breed. The value of this breed as a cross with either Leicester or short woolled sheep is very great, and it is held in high favour. The second kind of wool, clothing wool, comprises the short-stapled wool grown by the Southdown and Shrop shire Down breeds of English sheep, and the Merino (Spanish) sheep, from which are manufactured woollen goods, including broad-cloths and fancy kinds. The Southdown is a short-stapled, fine-haired, close-growing wool, used chiefly for clothing purposes. The value of this breed to New Zealand sheep-farmers consists mainly in the improvements which crossing with it imparts to the carcase. Some breeders have crossed the Southdown with the merino, and with cross-bred Romney Marsh and merino. The Shropshire Down is a breed which is"], [307, "285 WO OL \u2014 PR OD UCTS. growing every year into more importance. It produces a wool longer in the staple and more lustrous than any other Down breeds. It has been cultivated in New Zealand to a small extent only. The merino is the most valuable and important breed cultivated in New Zealand, and the flocks of the colony are chiefly composed of sheep of this class; they are of the Australian merino variety, improved through the importation of pure Saxon merino rams from Germany. The excellence of the merino con sists in the unexampled fineness and felting property of its wool,\" which in fineness and number of serrations and curves exceeds those of any other sheep in the world. The merinos adapt themselves to, and thrive in, every change of climate, and, with common care, retain all their fineness of wool as well under a tropical sun as in cold mountain regions. In New Zealand the length of staple and weight of fleeces have been increased, without any deterioration in the quality of the wool. During 1887, wool in value \u00a33,222,068 was exported. Agriculture is another essential element of colonisation. In that respect New Zealand has made remarkable progress. In ten years, from 1878 to 1888, the total extent of land in cultivation increased by nearly one million acres. In 1888, it amounted to more than seven and a quarter millions of acres, being an increase on the extent in 1887 of 448,550 acres. It is gratifying to note the growing increase of small freeholds, every year, during the last ten years. The product of coal is steadily increasing. In five years, from 1881 to 1886, the number of collieries in creased from 51 to 79 ; and the number of hands employed in them had increased 50 per cent. The output of coal during 1887 was 558,620 tons. Kauri gum is another important product, and shows no signs of abatement. In 1887, the quantity exported was valued at \u00a3362,000 sterling. Gold occupies a large space among the industrial products of New Zealand. The quantity of gold produced in and exported from New Zealand from the 1st of January, 1853, to the 31st of December, 1887, was 11,220,598 ounces, valued at \u00a344,042,576. During that year, 203,869 ounces, valued at \u00a3811,100, were exported."], [308, "286 INDUSTRIES\u2014 LOCAL EXHIBITION. Reference to my statistical memorandum in the Ap- pendix will show the rapid rise of the industry represented in the export of frozen meat. The industry began with the export of about three-quarters of a ton during 1882, and during 1887 20,000 tons were exported. The growth of local manufactories and works in the colony has of late years been remarkable. From 1881 to 1886, the increase in the number of these industries was 38 per cent. ; in the number of hands employed, 43 per cent. ; and 58 per cent, in the value of capital invested. The value of the work done amounted to a sum nearly approaching the value of the yearly imports of the colony. The more important among these industries were saw- mills, printing works, fellmongeries, tanning and scouring works, coach-building and painting works, iron and brass foundries, boot factories, gasworks, clothing factories, and woollen mills. Cheese and butter factories came into existence in the colony since 1881, and they are now an important and a rising industry. Breweries had not increased, and this fact, taken in conjunction with the lesser import of fermented and spirituous liquors, may be partly attributed with truth to the progress of temperance, as well as to the prevading monetary depression. Industrial Exhibitions (in the larger sense of the term), among their manifold advantages, have two grand cha- racteristics of usefulness : they are public and (so to say) living records of industrial growth, and are public incen- tives, as well as guides, to industrial progress. They are, in a wider sphere and on a more comprehensive scale, what agricultural shows are to farmers, horticultural shows to gardeners, and what the Academy is to artists. In 1885, a very successful exhibition in New Zealand industries was held at Wellington under the auspices of the Government. Local products, manufactures, and in- dustries were well represented, and the result was most creditable to the colony. In closing the Exhibition, the Governor, Sir W. F. D. Jervois, G.C.M.G., bore testimony to its success in the following terms, as stated in the official report: \u2014 \"When they looked round the building, they saw the splendid furniture made from New Zealand woods, the agricultural implements, and fine grates, some of which articles, a gentleman had remarked, were equal"], [309, "287 COLONIAL AND INDIAN EXHIBITION. to anything he had seen at home. He believed that remark was strictly true. And he said that, when they saw all these things, when they looked round and saw the splendid wool and clothing factories and furniture, and the various other industries which could be derived from local products, New Zealand would be able to produce every thing that was required, before long, for home consumption and for the starting of their own industries in this colony.\" The Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886, in London, bears further favourable testimony to the industrial products of New Zealand. And this testimony is espe cially valuable, because it proceeds from distinguished experts whom H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, on the recom mendation of the Council of the Society of Arts, appointed respectively to report on certain of the colonial sections of the Exhibition. I give, therefore, the following extracts from those reports on some of the chief New Zealand exhibits. The report on wools is by F. H. Bowman, D.Sc, F.R.S. Edin. The report first states that the wools exhibited in the New Zealand section were exceedingly well arranged, and that the classification was the best and most scientific in the whole Exhibition. It also points out the great necessity for care in the classification of wools in packing, specially the half-breds, so as to secure uniformity of quality in the individual lots or bales. Want of attention in this respect is very common, and often seriously detracts from the commercial value of the wool, and is thus a loss to the grower. The report then proceeds to notice the New Zealand wools exhibited, as follows : \u2014 \" The show of wools was in every respect first-class, and a wider range of kinds of wool was to be found here than in any other court. The qualities ranged from the very finest merino, both carding and combing, through the Downs to the splendid long-woolled types of Lincoln, Leicester, Romney Marsh, and Cotswold. Here also were represented the half-breds between each of these long woolled sheep and the merino, and the crosses back to the merino, so that the peculiar characteristics of these various wools in their intermixture with pure-bred merinos were splendidly shown. The character of the wool obtained by transplanting the pure long-woolled English sheep to the"], [310, "288 WOOLS. southern hemisphere, and the degree of persistency with which the type remained stamped in the samples exhibited, was most instructive, and clearly demonstrated that if ever there should be a much wider demand for long, strong, lustrous wools than English farmers can supply, that the climate and all the characteristics of New Zealand enable it to supply them in unlimited quantity and of quality which can hardly be surpassed. As in the case of all the other sections of the Exhibition, the fact that all the specimens exhibited were specially selected rendered it almost impossible to exceed the high standard every where attained. In this section samples were only sup plied for examination from each class, and not, as in other cases, from each exhibit, and hence individual exhibits cannot be commented on. The number of exhibitors in the merino class was seventeen. Taken one with another, they presented all the best qualities which this class of wool has in such large degree. Careful examination pre sented the fact that these New Zealand merinos had gene rally characteristics of their own in which they differed from the other colonial wools. They had not, in all cases, the lustre and exceeding softness of some of the Victorian wools, or the fineness of staple in some of the samples from New South Wales ; but they possessed firm, free, well-grown fibres, with great regularity in length and in the epidermal structure, and were magnificent wools for manufacturing purposes. The long combing merinos were shown by fourteen exhibitors, and were most excellent wools of their class. Some of the specimens were not exceeded in the whole Exhibition. The Down wools presented samples of the pure Down, Hampshire Down, and Shropshire Down, and in each of these cases the very best characteristics of the original stock were preserved and perpetuated. In the long-woolled breeds, there was a most magnificent show, no less than twenty eight exhibitors sending samples, of which sixteen were Lincoln ; two, Leicester ; three, Border Leicester ; six, Romney Marsh ; and one, Cotswold. Some of the Lincoln specimens were magnificent ; the strong, bold fibre, with high lustre and length, and heavy locks, showing how well all that was best in this wool was maintained ; but taken as a whole, the lustre was scarcely up to the high"], [311, "289 WOOLS \u2014 GRAIN. standard in the purest English-grown wool of this class. One of the samples of Leicester was equal to the very best English wool, and the Border Leicesters were equally good. The Romney Marsh wool had all the loftiness which usually characterises the fibre of this fine sheep ; and from the splendid examples shown, it seems as if the climate of New Zealand was peculiarly fitted for its growth. The Cotswold was also very good. In half-bred wobls, eight exhibits were presented, those shown by W. E. Ivey, Director of the School of Agriculture,* being specially worthy of notice. As might be expected when the pure breeds are so perfect, the half-breeds of their respective kinds are first-class also, In cross-breds and crosses back to the merino, there were seventeen exhibits, and, of their respective kinds, they were all excellent. Here, also, some of the samples shown by the Director of the School of Agriculture attracted special attention. Although, in this section, the exhibitors have not been given seriatim, it has been because all are so excellent in character that distinctions could scarcely be made, and it is sufficient to say that the whole exhibit was worthy of a colony which has reproduced the very best types of English wool, and in some eases surpassed them, and which must in the future always, if the same care in sheep culture is exercised, take a foremost place among the great wool-producing countries of the world.\" The report on grain is by W. Proctor Baker. The report begins by stating that the small collection of samples of New Zealand grain was extremely well shown, and that the collection of soils of twenty kinds, with the accompanying analyses printed in the New Zealand Catalogue, sent by the School of Agriculture of Canterbury, and the exhibit of cereals and grapes on the stalk con tributed by the Agricultural and Pastoral Association of Canterbury, with the particulars accompanying them, are examples of the most useful form which such exhibits can take for conveying instruction and information. The report adds that there is in New Zealand a great variety of soil, and that apparently by a proper adaptation of * This School of Agriculture is a branch of the Canterbury College, and is noticed in the descriptive sketch of the provincial district of Canterbury. U"], [312, "290 GRAIN. means every sort of cereal crop may be grown with great success. The agriculture, it states, is of a mixed type, and English systems are more generally approached than in any of the Australian colonies. The report proceeds to record the particulars, so far as they are stated, of the examples shown in sheaf by the Canterbury Agricultural and Pastoral Association ; and observes that even if these results were obtained from selected fields, as they probably were, they are sufficient to show wonderful fertility of soil. The report continues in the following words : \u2014 \"A large number of other samples were shown, such as Pearl wheat, weighing as much as 66^ lb., 661b., 65 lb. ; Tuscan wheat, 67 lb. ; Tuscan white, purple straw, 69 lb. (two examples) and 66 lb. ; Velvet chaff, 67 lb. These weights show the excellence of the quality. In fact, nothing finer than these wheats has probably ever been seen. The White Velvet and Pearl are both short-berried wTeak wheats. Wheat grown from White Oregon seed is poor in colour and body. The wheats of commerce which are shipped to England do not approach in quality these fine specimens. The samples of barley were simply magnificent, and such barleys as the Chevalier would bring enormous prices in England ; the best of them are of the white colour now so much sought after by the pale ale brewers, while the size of the grain is very large without being coarse, and it is dry and mellow ; so far as appeasances go there is every indication that these barleys would give the very best results in malting and brewing. If anything like the quality exhibited can be produced in quantity, and delivered in England in good condition, a ready market would be found for it, and supposing the produce in beer be equivalent to the appearance of the barley, at very high prices. This year the best of these barleys would be worth 50 per cent, more than wheat by the measured bushel of each. The Golden Melon is a useful brewing barley, of large berry but coarse rough skin. New Zealand ships some barley to the United Kingdom, but Victoria and the other Australian colonies are the chief customers. In the quality of its oats again, New Zealand is in the front rank. The samples of potato oats are unsurpassable ; another variety unfamiliar in England, the ' Sparrowbill,' is excellent in appearance,"], [313, "291 GRAIN \u2014 MINING INDUSTRIES. with the drawback, apparently, of being clad in a thick skin. The ' Canadian ' are of superb quality and weight. Long Tartarian, Short Tartarian, and Dun, which are of a grey colour, are grown to perfection. The exports of oats have been on the increase since the decline of wheat, and they are sent chiefly to Australia. No maize is shown, but all other grains in the collection are of the finest quality. Whether such splendid grain as is here exhibited is common, and can be obtained in quantity, is doubtful ; but still the fact remains that in all the chief grains New Zealand has shown by these samples a pro duction of superb quality and in prolific quantities. Canterbury and Otago are the districts from which practically the exports have taken place.\" Mining industries were reported on by C. Le Neve Foster, D.Sc, one of her Majesty's Inspectors of Mines. I make the following extracts from it relating to New Zealand. \" The general collection of the ores and minerals, made under Dr. Hector's directions, was well arranged and clearly displayed ; and as it was supple mented by contributions from the Minister of Mines, the Public Works Department, and numerous companies and private persons, the wealth of the colony in coal, metallic ores, and stone was brought before the British public in a plain and conspicuous manner. Antimony. \u2014 A table covered with splendid blocks of clean and solid stibnite and ingots of star antimony showed us the rich ore raised at Endeavour Inlet, near Picton in Cook Strait, and the products of the local smelting works. Stibnite is found in other localities, and sometimes accompanies or carries gold. The stibnite from Inangahua yields about 100 ounces of gold to the ton. Goal. \u2014 Coal-mining has now become an important branch of trade in New Zealand, and as the yearly output is increasing in a steady and regular manner, there is no doubt that the industry is established upon a firm footing. The Geological Survey, by a series of twenty-nine well-chosen examples, showed that many varieties of mineral fuel are to be found, viz. brown coal, pitch coal, glance coal, bituminous coal, and anthracite ; whilst large blocks from some of the principal collieries enabled us to estimate the importance of the seams. All these coals are of Cretaceous or Tertiary age.\" . . ."], [314, "292 GOLD. \" Gold.\u2014 Gold occurs in and is extracted from three kinds of deposits : I. Quartz veins ; II. Alluvial deposits ; III. Recent sea-beaches. I. The most important quartz-reefs are found in the Coromandel district on the Cape Colville Peninsula, and in the Thames district a little to the south. Some of the principal mines were well represented by rich specimens, and sent in addition full statements of the results obtained by crushing, which afford a better test of the true value of a mine than picked samples. ... It will be inferred from the low price obtained for the Thames gold that it is of a low standard. It is largely alloyed with silver, as shown by the following assay of a bar : \u2014 Gold 65-65 Silver ... \" 339 Copper 00-45 100*00 In the Otago district, auriferous quartz reefs occur in the Upper Foliated Schists, which probably are altered Silurian rocks; they are true fissure veins cutting across the planes of foliation, and are extensively worked. In the Middle Schists there are also thin layers of quartz parallel to the planes of foliation, which no doubt furnished much gold to the alluvial deposits. II. The gold-bearing alluvia of New Zealand are of various ages. The auriferous cements worked at Reefton belong to the Cretaceous period, but the richest gravels are Pleiocene. They are spread over the country in beds, often several hundred feet thick, especially in the Otago and Westland districts ; and, though not rich in gold, can be profitably worked by the hydraulic process, as water is abundant. The auriferous gravel is frequently cemented into a hard conglomerate which requires to be stamped.\" . . . \"III. The auriferous sand of some of the recent sea-beaches is derived from gold carried down by the rivers, both naturally and in the tailings discharged into them by mines. Some sand exhibited from the sea-beach at Thames yields 1-J ounce of gold to the ton, as it is gathered, and 4 ozs. 4 dwts. when concentrated ; it is not surprising to learn therefore these deposits are worked for gold. Before concluding the subject of gold, it may be well to mention that large heaps"], [315, "MINERALS. 293 of auriferous tailings exist in New Zealand as in Australia, awaiting the discovery of some cheap method of extracting the gold still remaining in them. Iron. \u2014 The most abundant iron ore in New Zealand appears to be the brown hematite found at Parapara, Nelson. Two large blocks of it were shown, as well as small specimens of red hematite and spathic iron. The sands \u00a9f some of the New Zealand beaches have offered a tempting field to smelters, but hitherto commercial success has not attended the efforts to utilize the iron contained in them. Manga nese.\u2014-The fine lumps of psilomelane shown by Mr. John Phillips from Waikatu, Bay of Islands, came from a deposit which is being successfully worked. Manganese ores occur in several other localities. Silver. \u2014 It seems somewhat strange to say that the New Zealand gold is the chief source of its silver, but such is literally the case ; the silver obtained in the colony is derived mainly from the bars of argentiferous gold produced at the Thames mines.\" ...\" Stone. \u2014 The exhibit of the Public Works Department, Wellington, included a variety of stones. A common material largely employed for building, road metal, and kerbs, is the so-called bluestone, a finely vesicular basalt, which may be used either rough or dressed, and is very durable. Good granite is also avail able. Limestone is plentiful, and is quarried in various places. Good blocks of it were displayed, as well as marble from Kamo, Whangarei. When ornamentation is required there is an abundant supply of the Oamaru stone, which is very extensively quarried. It is a granular calcareous sandstone, somewhat porous perhaps, but easily worked, even by wood-curving machinery. As it can be sold free on board in Oamaru at 9d. per cubic foot, it is not surprising that it finds a good sale in the Australian colonies as well as in New Zealand. Serviceable white and yellow sands suitable for glass-making are obtained at Mount Somers, and that good pottery clays exist is amply proved by exhibits of manufactured products. Samples of graphite, rolled cinnabar, galena, and zinc blende showed that these minerals, though not worked, are not wanting ; and a block of chromic iron came from a deposit in the serpentine near Nelson, which, from 1853 to 1856, furnished 5306 tons for export.\""], [316, "294 FROZEN MUTTON. The report on meat and dairy products was written by Clare Sewell Read. The following extract refers to New Zealand : \u2014 \" The New Zealand fresh mutton made a prominent show in the Colonial Market. The refrigerator was kept at work with its stock of frozen carcases, and they were retailed in joints in great quantities. The price of a whole sheep commenced at 6c?. per lb.; but gave way fully one halfpenny per lb. before the close of the Exhibition. As previously remarked, the quality of this mutton was excellent, and some idea of the immense import of this fresh meat may be gathered from the fact that at the time this report was written there were in the port of London 100,000 carcases of mutton in the cool stores and refrigerators of the ships. The market price is now so low that no profit, but rather a serious loss, is likely to accrue to the importers. This large reserve of frozen mutton is sure to keep down the value of ordinary sheep in this country for a considerable period, and may account for the exceptional difference which now prevails in the value of prime Down sheep and heavy ewes in the London Market; the former selling at 9c?., and the latter at 6d. per lb. If this imported mutton is forced upon the market, it will be sold at a great sacrifice, and will still further depress the value of all large and coarse sheep in England. In addition to fresh mutton, there were several prime joints of New Zealand beef retailed in the Colonial Market. These were evidently the best portions of well grazed bullocks, and at 7\\d. per lb. must be really cheap meat. But the mutton seems to stand the severe freezing process better than the beef. There were sundry specimens of New Zealand cheese in the Exhibition, much of which was injured by its long exposure to the heat and by the ungenial treatment it received, but it still showed some of its original rich flavour and good quality. The hams and bacon also suffered from a like cause. There were such animal refuse as tallow, neat's foot and trotter oil, bone dust, etc., which were well manufactured and pre served in excellent condition. And then there was a goodly array of tinned meats and soups shown by Messrs. Mitchell and Richards, the New Zealand Frozen Meat Company, the Gear Meat Preserving Company, the Wellington Company, and Messrs. R. and W. Hellaby."], [317, "295 TIMBER. Some of these meats were somewhat dry, and others a little over-cooked, and a portion of the corned beef was coarse and stringy. But the great bulk was very good ; the sheep tongues were delicate, and the ox tongues capital, quite equal to many that are cured in this country. The soups were excellent, especially the ox-tail, but there seems to be no necessity for proving it to be real ox-tail by retaining such a large quantity of big bones as some of the tins contained,\" The report on timber proceeds from Thomas Laslett, Timber Inspector and Surveyor of Forests to the Admi ralty (retired). The report, after referring to the effective display of New Zealand exhibits of timber, gives the following detailed and descriptive notice of some twenty in number, of the best in quality, observing that besides these there were, in the opinion of the writer, many others only a little less valuable : \u2014 \" The five best timbers are the Kauri Pine, Puriri, Rata, Rimu, and Totara. . . . Dacrydium. \u2014 There were two of this class exhibited, viz. the Manoao, Yellow or Golden Pine, D. colensoi, Hook, growing in North and Middle (South) Islands; the wood is hard, strong, and durable ; it would be useful for furniture and general purposes : and the Rimu, or Red Pine, D. cupressinum, Soland., a graceful and ornamental tree of larg-e dimen sions, found widespread over the colony ; its wood is reddish brown in colour, resembling rosewood, heavy, and takes polish ; it is suitable for architectural and engineer ing works, cabinet-making, and a variety of purposes. Dammara australis, Lamb, Kauri. \u2014 A majestic coniferous tree, found abundantly in many of the forests in the Auckland district. It is of straight growth, and tall enough, clear of branches, to make masts for ships of considerable burthen. The wood is pale straw colour, moderately hai-d, works up with a silky lustre, takes a good polish, and is fitted in every way for use in architecture, for furniture, and any conceivable object in carpentry, turnery, carving, and general purposes. This tree flourishes best in sheltered valleys and up the hill sides, but at the outskirts of the forest, upon high ground, it takes only a stunted form of growth. The cross section exhibited was very solid, and measured about 45 inches"], [318, "296 TIMBER. in diameter, the sapwood being about 5 inches thick, which is the average quantity found on healthy, vigorous trees of this diameter, while upon small trees it is much thicker. The Kauri yields a gum of great commercial value for the making of varnish, and in 1884 it is said that 6393 tons, valued at \u00a3342,151, were exported; large quantities were also exported in the previous years, chiefly to America. It is very remarkable, however, that the gum is obtained, for the most part, in the open country, where no forests at present exist, and is dug up from various depths beneath the surface of the ground. It is observed that only old trees, past their prime, yield the gum in any noticeable quantity, and I estimate that probably not 500 tons could be obtained from trees now standing in the forests. Fagus. \u2014 -'Of this, there are three varieties, known as Red, Black, and White ' Birch ' from the colour of the bark ; it grows at considerable altitudes, and is found widespread over the colony. The w-ood is moderately hard, straight-grained, and of light weight ; it is suitable for engineering and cabinet-work. Knightia excelsa, R. Br., the Rewarewa. \u2014 A tall tree of medium size, found in the Northern Island ; the wood is mottled red and brown, moderately hard, takes a good polish, and is fit for furniture and many puiposes. Leptospermum. \u2014 There are two of this class : the Manuka, L. ericoides, A. Rich. ; and Kahikatoa, or Tea- tree, L. scoparium, Forst, \u2014 found generally in the larger islands, but being small trees, the wood can only be employed for local purposes. Libocedrus. \u2014 Of this, two species were exhibited. The Pahautea, L. bidwillii, Hook, f., found in both North and Middle Islands, growing at considerable altitudes, is of medium size ; the wood is reddish in colour, mode rately hard and heavy, works easily, and is suitable for carpentry or furniture. The Kawaka, L. domiana, Endl., is also a tree of medium size ; the wood is reddish in colour, fine, straight-grained, heavy, and suitable for carving or furniture. Metrosideros. \u2014 There are two of this genus, viz. the Pohutukawa, M. tomentosa, A Cunn., found only on the rocky coasts, where it assumes a crooked form of stem and branches ; the wood is dark in colour, close in grain, hard, heavy, suitable for framework of wood-built ships: and the Rata, M. robusta, A. Cunn.,"], [319, "297 TIMBER \u2014 LEA THER. a tree which attains large dimensions, the wood being red in colour, hard, heavy, strong, and of a durable character, fit for piles, bridges, and generally for engineering and architectural works, and for furniture. Phijllocladus. \u2014There are two of this genus : the Tanekaha, P. tricho manoides, G. Don, a Celery-leaved Pine, of medium size, the wood pale straw colour, close-grained, moderately heavy, strong, and fit for spars, planking, and generally for carpentry ; it is found in the forests of the Northern Island, and is likely to be durable : the other is the Toatoa, P. alpinus, Hook, f., a small tree, the wood fit for furniture. Podocarpus. \u2014 Of this, there are four species found growing in the North and Middle Islands, viz. the Kahikatea or White Pine, P. dacridioides, A. Rich., which is found only on low grounds, and attains there noble dimensions ; the wood is whitish, soft, light, and, not being considered durable, chiefly valuable for local purposes : the Matai, P. spicata, R. Br., and Miro, P. ferruginea, G. Don, both known as Black Pine, are of widespread growth and medium size ; the wood is yellow in colour, close-grained, moderately hard, and suitable for cabinet purposes and architecture : the Totara, P. Totara, A. Cunn., is moderately abundant in the colony, attains large dimensions, and yields a very useful timber ; the wood is reddish in colour, close and straight in the grain, takes a good polish, and in appearance resembles mahogany, but is generally plain in character; it is suitable for archi tectural work, cabinet-making, and very generally in the domestic arts. The natives say canoes made of this wood are very durable. Vitex littoralis, A. Cunn., the Puriri tree. \u2014 It is of moderate dimensions, grows in the Northern Island, is stout, and yields good scantlings for engineering and architectural work; it is also suitable for furniture, the wood is brownish in colour, hard, heavy, and con sidered durable.\" Leather, leather goods, furs, hides, and tanning materials are reported on by James Powell. The following extracts relate to New Zealand : \u2014 \" In comparing Australian and New Zealand with Canadian sole leather, it is evident that the general character of the two former is substantially the same, whilst differing very considerably from that which is"], [320, "298 LEA THER \u2014 TANNING. produced in Canada. This is owing chiefly to the tanning material employed, each country making use of its native bark as the foundation of its tanning agent. The differ ence in quality is also owing to the methods of preparing the hide before the tanning process is begun, the Canadians practising the 'sweating' process, and the Australians and New Zealanders the ' liming ' process. One effect of this is that the Canadians produce a greater weight of leather from a hide than the Australians. The Canadian leather is tanned chiefly with hemlock bark, and is quite equal to the leather tanned in theUnited States.\" ...\" The principal tanning agent used in Australian and New Zealand leather is mimosa, or, as it is commonly called in the colonies, ' wattle ' bark.\" . . . \"The leather of Australia and New Zealand, as mentioned above, is not so solid as that of Canada. On the other hand, it is, however, much more ' cleanly fleshed,' ' lighter weighing,' more pliable, and more easily sewn, and therefore more adaptable for some purposes. The best Victorian and New Zealand tannages also have now a particularly bright colour, and the leather when used for soles of boots competes very closely in finish with good English tannages.\" After drawing attention to the superiority of Victorian tannage over that produced in New South Wales, the report continues : \" The New Zealand leather partakes more of the character of the Victorian tannages, and possesses the advantage of being tanned from stouter pelts, the New Zealand hides being much better grown, more compact, and of smaller pattern than Melbourne bides.\" ...\" There is one point, however, that is a chronic and great defect in Australian and New Zealand leather : viz. the flaying is generally very defective. The butchers do not use sufficient care in taking off the hides. There seems no remedy forth- coming to cure this fault. It is a very important point, and one which with a little determination conlcl doubtless be amended.\" The report suggests as a remedy the system in parts of England of paying a premium of sixpence for every hide that comes in well flayed ; and points out another fault in the branding of the hides, many of which are heavily branded, and generally on the butt, the best portion of the hide, spoiling the primest part. Although branding may be a necessity, care should"], [321, "TA NNING \u2014 FR UITS. 299 he taken to injure the hides as little as possible by branding in a less important part. In referring to some \"satin \"and \"waxed\" splits of Australian manufacture shown, which were well got up, well tanned, and well curried, but which were mostly oversized, and had not travelled very well, the report states that the leather had the advantage of being softer and more supple than the Canadian curried leather, and adds that \" if it could be produced to compete in price with Canadian ' satins ' and ' splits,' and as carefully packed, so as to arrive in good condition, a large trade could no doubt be done in these goods by the Australian and New Zealand tanners and curriers.\" The report also states that the best Australian and New Zealand hasils (tanned sheep) were, in evenness of colour, in soundness of grain, in freedom from grease, and in general appearance, sightliness, and finish, superior to the best Canadians, both as regards the soft-tanned basils for dressing and colouring purposes, and also in the \"set out\" and \"strained\" basils for lining and other uses. With respect to tanning materials, the report proceeds as follows : \u2014 \" Australia and New Zealand may be grouped together for the purpose of this report. They have an admirable tanning agent in the bark of the acacia mimosa, or wattle, as it is spoken of in the country. The leather produced by means of this bark is some of it of bright colour and high excellence, and large quantities are sent to this country, where it sells as readily as the production of our own tan-yards.\" ...\" The Tanekaha bark (Phyllocladus trichomanoides, a tree of the yew family), that comes from New Zealand, is used by dressers of glove leather to give the fashionable tan tint to Cape and other gloves. A specimen was exhibited in our 1851 Exhibition, which attracted the notice of a leading house in that line in London. For many years they enjoyed a profitable monopoly of their useful discovery, but the secret has been an open one for the last twenty years, and all the principal glove-leather dressers now know and use the bark that produces this popular colour.\" The report on fruits was written by D. Morris, M.A., F.L.S. It states that \" the best and most successful fruits for export purposes in New Zealand appear to be the apple, pear, and quince. Excellent apples of a most"], [322, "300 FRUITS \u2014 SILK. attractive colour and size were shown in the New Zealand Court for three weeks after arrival, proving that they possess excellent keeping qualities. Besides apples, there were received from New Zealand, during the course of the Exhibition, such fruits as pears, lemons, limes, walnuts, all of which arrived in fairly good condition.\" The report places on record the mode of packing the apples which arrived in very good condition. Mr. John Bowman, of Green Lanes, Auckland, had packed his apples in a close case of Kauri pine, with no holes for ventilation. Each apple was wrapped in tissue paper, and completely sur rounded with chaff, so tightly packed that the fruit could not shake about. The apples were from one and a half to two inches apart at the nearest point. Each layer of apples was separated by a wooden shelf. The chaff was not dried artificially before packing. On opening the case, from 10 to 15 per cent, only were found unfit for use, the rest of them being in perfect condition and still retaining their bloom. The apples had not sweated at all, nor had the dampness from the bad fruit affected the good ones near them. The fruit, being large and fine, attracted great attention from visitors, and when placed in a glass case in a prominent part of the Court, was generally taken for models similar to those shown in the Australian colonies. The report concludes as follows : \u2014 \" Of fruits preserved in syrup, the only successful exhibit was that shown by Mrs. N. D. Knight, of New Plymouth, which consisted of an assortment of thirty-six New Zealand fruits in excellent order. Of jams, the best exhibits were those of Messrs. Holland Brothers, Wellington, and Messrs. Kirkpatrick and Co., of Nelson. All these were put up in attractive, well-made tins, and consisted of strawberry, cherry, plum, black currant, peach, raspberry, gooseberry, nectarine, tomato, greengage, apple, Orleans plum, apricot, and damson.\" The report on silk, by Thomas Wardle, F.C.S., after noticing the fact that no exhibits of silk, raw or manu factured, appeared in the New Zealand Court, recommends encouragement to be given to sericulture in New Zealand, under the new conditions as to the consignment and facility of sale of cocoons to the Bengal silk-reelers. The report suggests the probability that New Zealand may have a"], [323, "301 SILK. wild silk-producing fauna hitherto unobserved, and the writer hopes that local entomologists will make inquiries and observations on this subject. He states that, the Natural History of New Zealand possessing such singular and unique interest, it is quite possible that, a thorough inquiry may result in information about silk-producing Lepidoptera of unique species, and that, in confirmation of this idea, he noticed in the New Zealand Court a very curious caterpillar called the Vegetable Caterpillar, ex hibited by Mr. Charles Sidey. The report adds that, with a climate like that of New Zealand, it is inconceivable at present what species of silk-producers may not be ulti mately acclimatised. I may state on this subject that (apart from the question of indigenous silkworms) there is no doubt of the natural suitability of New Zealand for silk-culture. Mulberry trees are successfully grown in the North Island. Mr. G. A. Schoch addressed on April 30th, 1887, to the Minister of Lands in New Zealand, a general report on his work and endeavour to introduce silk-culture in New Zealand during the preceding twelve months. His report is printed as a New Zealand Parliamentary Paper (H. 11, September 11th, 1887). Mr. Schoch states that the number of white mul berry trees suitable for silkworm food was between 19,000 and 20,000 ; and that he had ordered some white mulberry seed from Italy which should, at least, produce 100,000 mulberry trees. He had distributed about' 600,000 silk worm eggs. Both varieties, the Italian and the Japanese, with which he himself made experiments, hatched splendidly. Altogether he is of opinion that the practica bility of establishing silk-culture in New Zealand as a permanent industry is placed beyond all question. Two things, he observes, remain to be done ; the one is to increase the number of mulberry trees, and the other is to induce a sufficient number of persons to take the matter up to secure an export trade. On the subject of the educational institutions of New Zealand, and of the progress of general education, I must refer my readers to that part of the statistical memorandum, appended hereto,* which relates to that subject.

I have already had occasion to refer to the question of the New Zealand Debt in writing about the policy of 1870, and have mentioned the general principles which should, as I think, govern our consideration of the question with a view to forming a sound and just conclusion on the subject. The same principles should, in my opinion, be applied to New Zealand finance as shown to be existing in the latest accounts to which I have been able to refer.

CHAPTER XV. Emigration \u2014 Influx of Chinese\u2014 Free Trade\u2014 Imperial Federation. Before I conclude my work, I wish to make a few remarks on four subjects of practical interest to New Zealand, but embracing in their scope other British colonies, and, in some respects, the United Kingdom. These subjects are \u2014 Emigration, Influx of Chinese, Free Trade, and Imperial Federation. Each subject, to be fully dealt with, would require a book for itself. All that I can venture here to say about them will consist in brief allusion to principles bearing, in my view, on the proper consideration of each subject, and possibly suggestive of matter for further dis cussion. The practical and satisfactory solution of great problems is facilitated by their presentation in various aspects, and by their controversial treatment on differing grounds ; and it is only in the hope of contributing, how ever little, to that end that I presume to approach their consideration. Emigration has been for a long time, and is still, the theme of general controversy. A considerable amount of debate on the subject arises from the fact that arguers on all sides \u2014 and there are many sides of the question \u2014 often attach different meanings to the terms which they use, and conduct their discussions on lines which never meet. For my present purpose, I begin by stating what I mean when I use certain terms, and then proceed to refer shortly to some general principles on which I think that the question should be practically treated. And this is the course which I propose to follow in my remarks on the other subjects. In using the term \"emigration,\" I mean by it the process of transplanting persons from the United"], [326, "304 EMIGRATION. Kingdom into a British colony, in the way most likely to secure their permanent growth in that colony. _An emigrant, in that sense, is a person who leaves the United Kingdom with a reasonably assured prospect of becoming a colonist, or, in other words, a living graft on the colonial tree. I now take a further step in defining more exactly the sense which, in my present argument, I attach to the term \"emigration.\" But a few words of prefatory explana tion may make my meaning clearer. It must, I think, be generally admitted that in the United Kingdom there is too much, and in the colonies (I take the Australasian colonies for example) too little population. The evil of these disproportions affects both sides, but in different ways. In the United Kingdom, pauperism and all its endless train of social calamities are the result. In the colonies capital and labour are inadequate to the proper development of the resources of the country. Under proper conditions, there is room for the useful and remunerative employment of a much larger population. The evil from wbich the colonies suffer is, no doubt, in a much more mitigated form than in the United Kingdom, but the essential feature in the question is that there is on the part of both a reciprocity of demand and supply. This reciprocity points in the direction of a twofold remedy, which, prudently and properly administered, would secure immense benefit to both parties. But here I wish to guard myself against any supposition that I believe the mere transfer of the pauper surplus of popu- lation from the United Kingdom to the colonies to be an effective remedy. My belief is absolutely and strongly opposed to that idea. Such a pretence of cure would be wholly futile, and is quite impracticable. What is needed in colonies is an increase of capital and labour in due pro- portion to each other ; and the labour must be of good quality. Immigrants, industrious and of good character, are wanted ; the numbers of each sex should approach to equality ; and family and social ties are, as a rule, desirable. Moreover, in particular colonies and at particular times, special classes of immigrants are needed. On the whole emigration is a question of delicate and difficult adiust ment. A general influx of paupers would do no o-ood to themselves, and it would be repugnant and intolerable to"], [327, "305 EMIGRATION. the colonies affected. And it does not at all follow that because excess of population in the United Kingdom entails pauperism, it is essential that the paupers should be bodily transferred to another country. Induce a suffi cient population, representing fair proportions of capital and labour, to emigrate, and that emigration of itself will tend to diminish pauperism by subjecting it to better con ditions, under which it will be able to work out, more or less, its own independence. What is wanted is more room for the better employment of capital and labour, and that is effected by merely lessening the crowd of competitors. We may do that by systematic emigration on higher levels, but it is not possible to do it by working at emigration on the lowest level. No doubt, it would be easy to show that the evils borne by the United Kingdom from the want of systematic emigration are much more grievous than those borne by colonies from the same cause. But it is quite enough for my argument that there are evils on both sides ; for that fact brings me to the conclusion that the remedy for the evils which both suffer should be jointly determined and jointly carried into effect, each bearing a fair proportion of the cost. Emigration, therefore, should be the conjoint work of the two parties to whom it is advantageous, namely, the United Kingdom as represented by its Legislature and its Government, and by the colony receiving that emigration, represented in like manner by its own legislative and executive authorities. The respective shares of administration and of cost should be jointly settled, not in a mercenary, but in a liberal and generous spirit. I do not wish to discourage private associations for the conduct of emigration, or to lessen spontaneous emigration. Of course, however emigration takes place, it must be voluntary on the part of the emigrants. All that I contend for is that emigration, in order to have the best practical effect, should, in part, be a public service, and that the public system adopted should be jointly agreed to and jointly administered by the two states, if I may so term them, which have a common interest in it, namely, the United Kingdom and the particular colony to which the emigration is directed. In this way, moreover, I believe, another great obstacle to the progress of emigration w#uld be removed. At present, X"], [328, "306 EMIGRA TION. there is no doubt that in our great self-governing colonies there exists a strong feeling on the part of the mass \u2014 the wages class, as it is called \u2014 of the community against State emigration. This antagonism is founded on two grounds ; first, because the cost of the service has been exclusively borne by the colony ; and, secondly, because the emigration has altogether consisted of competitors in the labour market, and tended to the reduction of wages. Should it, however, be seen that State emigration was jointly adopted, conducted, and paid for by the two parties directly con cerned therein, the United Kingdom and the colony ; and, further, that the emigration did not wholly consist of labourers, but of persons representing, in due proportions, capital and labour, it is reasonable to anticipate that the objection hitherto existing would disappear. At all events, no system of emigration, such as I am pointing to, could be undertaken unless the people of the colony concerned agreed, through its constitutional representatives, to the undertaking and had had a voice in its arrangement. Following up, then, the line of my argument, I am of opinion that the following principles should govern a system of emigration : \u2014 1. The United Kingdom and the colony to which emigration is directed should, from time to time, jointly settle through their respective constitutional authorities, executive and legislative, the nature of the system, its particulars, and the shares of its administration and of its cost, to be borne respectively by the United Kingdom and the colony. 2. The negotiations and the agreement should, in each case, be with some one colony, and not with colonies gene rally, or with any group of colonies. Practically, it may be said that these principles are suffi cient for my purpose, for they secure the joint consideration and the joint adjustment of details to the interests of all concerned. The interests of the emigrants themselves are sufficiently guarded, because their emigration is a volun tary act, and because they are doubly represented by their constitutional representatives, in esse at home, and in posse at the colony to which they emigrate. It may be that a part of the cost of their passages may be fairly charged to them. Also in some cases contingent rights to land,"], [329, "307 EMIGRATION \u2014 CHINESE QUESTION. on the fulfilment of certain conditions, may be offered. But all these details would be best settled by the parties primarily interested in the arrangement. I would, how ever, observe by the way that, from what I have seen and read on the subject of emigration, any system of taking promissory notes or imposing monetary obligations, to be discharged at some future time, on emigrants is objection able, and that prepayment, even if much less in amount, is far preferable. I would also state that, though I have not laid it down as a principle, I attach great importance to the due intermixture of capital and labour in any system of emigration as conducive to its success. Small capitalists could be assisted to emigrate. Reasonable pros pects should be held out to every labouring emigrant to improve his position. The arrangement of details would not, of course, require special conferences of imperial and colonial representatives. When the leading features of the joint system had been settled, the adjustment of details could be safely left to the proper officers. Influx of Chinese is a question unique in its character, and it should be considered on special and exceptional grounds. I admit at once the international principle that', in ordinary circumstances, there is a reciprocal right, as between England and other friendly and civilised countries, of passage into and out of the British dominions and those countries. It may be also that there are imperial treaties between England and China, securing for China special consideration in that respect, but I can hardly conceive that to be the case, for the Imperial Government of the United Kingdom has for some time past, at different dates, allowed and assented to colonial legislation in Australasia restrictive, more or less, of Chinese immi gration into Australasian colonies. At all events, my own opinion is, both from an imperial and a colonial point of view, that there is irresistible cause for excepting China from the right of free and unlimited ingress into British possessions. I do not found this opinion on arguments which are often, as I think mistakenly, put forward in the Australasian colonies, namely, that Chinese immigration consists wholly of males ; that the immigrants return to their own country after gleaning what they can in a"], [330, "308 CHINESE QUESTION. colony ; that their ways are not as our ways ; that they undersell Europeans in the prices of labour and of pro duce ; that many (Chinese) are filthy in their habits, and immoral in their conduct. Even were all these state ments accurate, I do not think that internationally a case could be fully made out on those grounds alone for restricting or prohibiting Chinese emigration. On the contrary, my argument would not be affected if I admitted that Chinese emigrants were thrifty, industrious, good, and useful colonists. What appears to me the incontrovertible justification for the restriction, and even prohibition, of Chinese emigration is the enormous and overpowering force of numbers in the population of China. It is quantity, and not quality, which is the insuperable objection. Self-preservation is the law of communities as well as of individuals. Australasian colonies have, each and all, the inalienable right of resisting national efface ment, whether it proceeds from conquest or from swamping by alien emigration. Two or three millions of men would hardly be missed from China, but they would be more than enough, by quietly availing themselves of consti tutional rights granted to all male residents in the Austra lasian colonies, to make those colonies practically Chinese possessions. This influx need not be immediate or simul taneous ; it might be spread over a considerable space of time ; and if it were numerically insufficient, it could soon be doubled with ease. It is idle to say that the danger is fanciful, and that it never can take place. No one in these times can foretell international events. If we shut our eyes and allow things to drift, the contingency is not im possible and not even improbable. At least, there is no doubt that it would be almost impossible to dislodge from Australasia a large Chinese population when it threatened to become preponderant. Timely precaution, therefore, is wise. These considerations seem to me fully to justify the Australasian movement against the influx of Chinese. The concluding- words of the representatives of the Australasian Conference on the subject at Sydney, in June, 1888, read from a telegram by the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies to the House of Commons on the 16th of that month, substantially adopt the principle which I have stated. The colonies, it is said, \" now con-"], [331, "CHINESE QUESTION. 309 fidently rely upon the support of her Majesty's Govern ment in their endeavour to prevent their country from being overrun by an alien race, who are incapable of assimilation in the body politic, strangers to our civili sation, out of sympathy with our aspirations, and unfitted for our free institutions, to which their presence in any number would be a source of constant danger.\" The remedy to which the Conference points is undoubtedly the best, if it can be secured. The Conference suggests that the Imperial Government of the United Kingdom should negotiate with the Government of China with a view of obtaining as soon as possible a treaty under which all Chinese, except officials, travellers, merchants, students, and such classes, should be entirely excluded from the Australasian colonies. The Conference understood that a treaty of the kind has been made between the United States and China. There seems to be no reason why it should not similarly be made between England and China. It is, however, now said that the treaty in question has not been ratified. I am surprised that our Imperial Government has not long ago entered into negotiations with the Government of China on the subject. The diffi culty ahead must long ago have been seen, and the question has been repeatedly brought before the Imperial Govern ment in the shape of more or less restrictive colonial legislation with respect to Chinese emigration into Austra lasian colonies. Apart from the interpretation of existing treaties, it is scarcely conceivable that the English Govern ment should imagine that the Chinese Government would, after what had occurred with respect to the original ad mission of English traders into China, silently acquiesce in the enforcement of that restrictive legislation. The difficulties of dealing satisfactorily and completely with this question have been much aggravated by procrastina tion, but I trust that they may be soon overcome, and that, in a matter of great importance to the domestic interest of the British Empire and to its relations with China, a permanent, peaceful, and honourable settlement may be obtained without further delay. Protection is in New Zealand and in other Australasian colonies a great political cry. It is difficult to disembarrass"], [332, "310 FREE TRADE. the question of Free Trade from the conventional fallacies with which its advocates and its opponents often overload its discussion. Enthusiasts on either side look at the sub ject from different points of view, and, as in other dis putes, use terms to which they attach different meanings. The natural result is confusion of tongues ; and contro versy goes round and round in a vicious circle. Another prevailing fault seems to be that there is too much ten dency to the creation of shibboleths in these branches of political economy. No allowance is made for qualifying circumstances and necessary modifications in the practical application of principles. Take Free Trade as an example. Does Free Trade purely and simply mean buying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest ? If so, would any Englishman in bis senses insist that England should, for instance, depend altogether on the continuous supply of munitions of war on a foreign country, provided that those munitions can be supplied there of equal quality at a cheaper price than they could be manufactured at home p Many Free Traders would, I think, even pause before accepting the lowest tender, when it came from a foreign country, for our oceanic mail services, even though that tenderer was well able to perform that service. Com mercial unions, again, are often advocated by so-called Free Traders, though those unions involve discriminative duties against outsiders. It is a mistake, in the considera tion of Free Trade, to look upon the whole world, for the purposes of demand and supply, as one large country inhabited by one people, subjects of one sovereign or belonging to one nation, and to ignore the contrary facts. Take, further, the question of Protection. It is, no doubt, wrong that the whole community should be taxed in order that farmers, or manufacturers, or those engaged in any particular profession or trade, should be able to make money. One class should not be enriched at the cost of all other classes. But Protection in its broader sense is not an inflexible principle. Look at New Zealand, for instance. In the early years of that colony, when the tariff was arranged, a considerable, but not prohibitive, duty was charged on imported beer. The consequence was that the local manufacture of beer was encouraged, and soon became an established native industry. In the"], [333, "FREE TRADE. 311 course of a few years the greater part of the colony was able to supply itself with good local beer at a cheaper rate than it could be imported. Protection, if it can be so termed, in that case resulted in the community being able to get for all future time a good article locally sup plied at a less price than it could be imported ; and this permanent advantage was gained at the trifling cost of paying for a few years a little more for imported beer. I do not, of course, mean that beer has now ceased to be imported, but I am referring to the supply of the great mass of beer-consumers. Apart from the question (a question, however, of great economic importance) of establishing a native industry in a young colony, the con dition of Free Trade, namely, the buying in the cheapest market, became fulfilled in a few years ; when, otherwise, generations might have elapsed before the local industry would have been able to be permanently and generally established. The truth is that, besides the great principle of Free Trade, there is the greater principle of the greatest good for the greatest number in each country. Whenever it can be clearly shown that a modification of Free Trade would, in all reasonable probability, permanently secure that object, modification is not only an allowable, but a desirable work. Free Traders and Protectionists should view their respective causes in that light, and judge them by that test. They should not be carried away by cries, but they should set themselves deliberately and in telligently to the work of proving to the majority of the people that what they wish to do will permanently ensure the greatest good of the greatest number ; and that, even at a temporary small cost in the mean time, it will be worth while to secure that result. This line of reasoning, I venture to think, should apply to all phases of Free Trade and Protection. In a young colony, where the opportunities for establish ing new industries suitable to the conditions of the country often present themselves, Free Trade and Protection are questions of multiform character. Each measure connected with them should be considered on its own merits, and its discussion and practical application should, according to my view, proceed on the lines which I have indicated."], [334, "312 IMPERIAL FEDERATION. Imperial Federation is, in other words, the constitu tional representation of British colonies in the manage ment of imperial affairs. The self-governing colonies have now representative institutions for the conduct of their own local affairs ; but in imperial affairs they have no constitutional voice. And yet it is evident that to a great extent the administration of imperial affairs directly and indirectly affects their interests. Foreign policy proves this beyond doubt. The Polynesian question, the influx of Chinese, and, above all, the occurrence, or even the probability, of war between England and some great foreign power are cases in point. Colonial representation in imperial matters would necessarily include a propor tionate share of expenditure in their administration. The burden accompanies the advantage. Looking at the ques tion in its completeness, I cannot understand the reason ing of those who argue that the grant of colonial representation for imperial purposes would be a wrong done to self-governing colonies. The proposal is not to curtail local self-government, but to add to it, in imperial matters, a share in the constitutional privilege of self government. Nor can I understand the argument that the colonies would be worse off under a system of Imperial Federation than they are at present. It is true that colo nies do not contribute, with slight exceptions, to the cost of imperial government. But, apart from the doubtful doctrine that constitutional rights can be measured by money value, it is notorious that the colonies under the existing system suffer heavily from imperial policy and administration, and that, in the case of a great war in which the United Kingdom became engaged, their losses would be infinitely greater, while, at the same time, they would have been unable to exercise any constitutional influence in the inception of the war, and would continue to be unable to exercise that influence in its conduct and in its termination. It is unreasonable to argue the ques tion as if at present the colonies were mere onlookers at British imperial policy ; they are members of the imperial body politic, and suffer when the body suffers. Moreover, Imperial Federation would not only be the constitutional mode of treating external matters, but it would also enable the whole empire to deal effectively and to the"], [335, "IMPERIAL FEDERATION. 313 greatest advantage with internal interests of great magni tude \u2014 interests which are now either overlooked or imper fectly treated. Among those interests are immigration, postal union, telegraphic connection, trade, national and colonial debts, and criminal jurisdiction. The tendency of Imperial Federation would be to knit closely together the various parts of the British Empire, and to enable the whole to act, when the occasion arose, with oneness of purpose, with combination of power, with promptitude, and with effect. I assume throughout that the entrance into Federation, and the definition of imperial subjects, are unanimously agreed to by all concerned. The rapid advance which the question of Imperial Federation has made in the public mind within the United Kingdom during the last four years (I am writing in September, 1888) is a remarkable fact. The question has not been forced into notice by pressure from the colonies or from the mass of population within the United King dom. The idea has, as it were, suddenly seized and occupied the minds of many statesmen of all parties, and of other representative men in commercial and social life. The Imperial Federation League, though still in the days of its infancy, comprises many eminent names on its roll. The League has wisely refrained from putting forward any cut-and-dried scheme of Imperial Federation ; and it has worked well in ventilating the subject, in bringing together and aiding fellow-workers in the cause, in doing much with a view to the practical consideration of the principles of the question, and in taking advantage of all opportunities of progressing towards the great end which it has in view, namely, the consolidation of the empire. And although the work of the League creates little popular enthusiasm, there is behind it a solid mass of public opinion. Men may differ as to the course to be taken, but the general public view is, without a shade of doubt, towards the close union of all parts of the British Empire, and the maintenance of its integrity. The great need of co-operation in matters of imperial interest is instinctively felt, and the problem is how to supply that need. Step by step the opinion that large changes in the present imperial system are desirable is gaining ground. The conference, in 1887, of imperial and colonial representatives in London"], [336, "314 IMPERIAL FEDERATION. was an important step in that direction. The agreement on the subject of imperial naval defence in respect of the Australasian colonies was another. The Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886, and the proposed Imperial Institute, now in process of organisation, point to the same quarter. My own opinion is that the solution of the problem of Imperial Federation lies in making the Imperial Parlia ment imperial in its constitution, and in confining its action to imperial affairs. For this twofold purpose, colonial members should be elected by the colonies to the House of Commons, and local legislation and administra tion within the United Kingdom should be transferred to other representative body or bodies. But an indispensable condition to such a large constitutional change is that the hearty assent and hearty co-operation of the United King dom and of the colonies must first combine to effect the change. The foundation of the plan must be a strong and general public wish on the part of all concerned that the plan should be adopted. It would be worse than useless to try to force any plan on reluctant, or even indifferent, communities. Also, I quite recognise that in the mean time much may and should be done in other ways to cement the union of all parts of the British Empire, and to improve and strengthen the action of all, or of groups of them, in matters of common imperial interest. Public opinion, when it is ripe for constitu tional change, will indicate and demand the change which it desires. The best way,, in the interval, of ensuring the growth of sound public opinion on the subject is to pro mote the dissemination of knowledge bearing on it, its public discussion in all its branches, and, on the part of all imperial authorities, to give practical proofs that, while scrupulously abstaining from interference with self governing colonies in local matters, they wish, as far as it is practicable, to take the colonies into their confidence and counsels in matters of common imperial interest."], [337, "315 APPENDIX A.

The census of 1886, and the statistical returns founded thereon, afford a special vantage-ground for this purpose. My thanks are due to the Agent-General for New Zealand and the officers of his department for the access courteously afforded to me, when I required it, to local parliamentary papers and other published documents, in their possession, relating to New Zealand. I am also largely indebted to the Registrar-General of New Zealand for material drawn from his late valuable reports and tables, which have given me much and in dispensable aid in my effort to place in a clear and compact form interesting and instructive information relating to the population and resources of the colony. As this information necessarily involves a rather formidable array of figures, I have thought it more convenient to separate this memo randum from the body of my book, and to insert it in the Appendix for reference thereto. The statistics which I give are recent and authentic. They will not only form a basis for the verification of statements which I have made, and for conclusions which I have drawn, but they will also enable readers to form their own estimate of the existing condition of New Zealand. The population, exclusive of the Maoris, in New Zealand, as returned in the census taken on the 28th of March, 1886, was 578,182 in number: males, 312,221 ; and females, 266,261. The number of Chinese at that time was 1512 persons, of whom only 15 were females. The estimated population, exclusive of the Maoris, on the 31st of December, 1887, was 615,330 in number : males, 317,398 ; and"], [342, "320 APPENDIX C. females, 297,932. The estimated Chinese population on that date, included above, was 1613 persons, of whom 18 were females. The percentage of the population iu 1886 born in New Zealand was 51 *89 ; in the United Kingdom, 40*43 ; in Australia and Tasmania, 2*98 ; in other British possessions, 0*68 ; in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, 0*86; in Germany, 0*87; in China, 0*79. The persons re tamed as having been bom in the United States amounted to 0*12 per cent., but the Registrar-General remarks that probably many of those given as born in America or North America were born in the States, and that consequently the proportion given may be too low. The population in 1886 resident on gold-fields numbered 59,533, of whom there were 36,420 males and 23,113 females. The total number of houses and tents inhabited by that population was 15,610, of which oidy 1221 were tents and dwellings with canvas roofs. The houses of brick or stone were 809 ; and of wood and iron, 10,886 ; the remainder were of other materials. The birth-rate in 1886 was 33*15 per 1000 of the population. This birth-rate, which was the lowest in New Zealand for several years, was higher than the birth-rate in England in 1885 (32*5), but less than the mean English birth-rate for the hist 48 years (340 1. Nor does the New Zealand birth-rate for 1886 compare favourably with those in the Australasian colonies. In 18S0, it had the highest birth-rate (40*78); in 1886, the lowest but one, namely, that in Victoria (31*23). The proportions of sex were 104*72 males born to every 100 females. In England, the proportions of males to the 100 females born during the ten years, 1876-1885, varied between 103*5 and 104*2. The death-rate in 1886 was 10*54 per 1000 persons of the popu lation. This is the lowest rate on record, with the exception of that in 1874 (1013) and that in 1884 (10*39). The death-rate calculated on the whole population is not a fair index of the comparative healthiness of new and old countries, nor even of that of new countries one with another, when the relative proportions living at the several age-periods vary considerably. The only correct method, in such cases, is to com pare the death-rates at each year of life or at each quinquennium. I extract from the Registrar-General's report on New Zealand statistics for 1886 the following comparative return of this kind on the quin quennial basis : \u2014 \"The following were the death-rates per 1000 living for New Zealand, the Australasian colonies named, and England respectively, at successive age-periods for the years stated : \u2014 \u25a0 .

This lower rate in New Zealand is au important factor in the low general death-rate. The death-rate at each ago-period was lower in New Zealand than in the other countries named, with the following exceptions : \u2014 \"At 5 and under 10 the rates in New Zealand and Tasmania were the same. \" At 10 and under 15 the rates in South Australia and Tasmania were lower. \" At 20 and under 25 the rate in England was lowest. \" At 35 and under 45 the rate in Tasmania was lower. \" At 45 and under 55 the rate in Tasmania was lower. \" The rates for 75 years and upwards are not fairly comparable apart from the proportions living* at each year of age above 75, as those countries having the largest proportionate numbers at the more advanceel ages have in consequence the highest death-rates for that age-period.\" The rate of mortality in New Zealand from specific febrile or zymotic diseases was considerably less than in England and in the other Australasian colonies. Small-pox does not appear as a cause of death in New Zealand. The precautions taken against its intro duction into the colony have proved effectual. The death-rate from phthisis is much less in New Zealand than in England, or than in either of the other Australasian colonies except Western Australia. This fnct is the more noteworthy, because it is certain that in New Zealand and the other Australasian colonies the death-rate from phthisis is materially increased by the deaths of persons who have arrived in a diseased condition, or with strong predisposition to that disease. For instance, in New Zealand in 1886, in the deaths from phthisis 11 per cent, were of persons who had not resided three years in the colony, and may be presumed to have arrived in a diseased condition. There are 37 hospitals in the colony, in which beds can be made up for 870 male and 333 female patients. There are 7 public lunatic asylums, and 1 licensed private asylum. At the end of 1SS7, there were 1053 male and 642 female patients in these asylums. There are also 8 benevolent asylums, 6 orphan asylums, a deaf-mute institution, and several industrial schools. In December, 1887, there were 1093 public primary schools main tained by the State, exclusive of those established by Government for the special education of the Maori race, which will be noticed in my remarks on the Maori census. There were 110,919 pupils on the rolls at the end of the year, or more by 4591 than at the end of 1886 The daily attendance for the year, estimated according to the working average, was 87,937, and for the fourth quarter 89,589. When the census of 1886 was taken it was estimated that, out of a total of 91,473 European children at the compulsory school-ages, 7 to 13, the percentage of children at those ages who attended school was 97*94 per cent. The number of children attending Sunday schools increased from 78,S91 in 1881, to 99,884 in 1886. The percentage of the Y"], [344, "322 APPENDIX C. European male population, at 5 years of age and upwards, able to lead and write was 87*17 per cent. ; and of the female population, 85*97 per cent. In 1887, the aided or endowed colleges, grammar and high schools, giving secondary education, numbered 22. The number of pupils at these secondary schools in December, 1887, was 2242, with an average attendance of 2093. Junior and Senior Civil Service Examinations are conducted by the Education Department in New Zealand under the provisions of \" The Civil Service Reform Act, 1886.\" The number of graduates admitted by examination in the New Zealand University amounted in April, 1S8S, to 169 ; and the number of undergraduates on the roll was 840. The affiliated colleges, Auckland University College, Canterbury College, and Otago Uni versity, were attended in 1S87 by 580 students, of whom 266 were matriculated. The New Zealand Institute is a most valuable aid to scientific education. It was first constituted under a special Act passed in 186S, and annually receives a public grant of \u00a3500. The object of the Institute is to encourage the pursuit of science, and, with that object, to collect, record, and criticise all local discoveries directly or indirectly connected therewith. It is under the direction of governors annually elected, and its manager is Sir James Hector, K.C.M.G., the Director of the New Zealand Geological Survey. It has published nineteen volumes of its yearly proceedings and transactions, containing instructive papers on zoology, botany, chemistry, geology, and miscel laneous scientific subjects. The Institute consists of an incorporation of local scientific societies at Auckland, Hawke's Bay, Wellington, Canterbury, Otago, and Southland. The number of members on the roll of the Institute in August, 18S7, was altogether 1156. The educational power of public libraries has for some years back been strengthened in New Zealand by State pecuniary aid on con ditions framed for securing the object in view. A grant of \u00a31000 was distributed in proportion to the income, derived from voluntary con tributions and other sources, of the several public libraries. The number of libraries that received this public aid in 1887 was 361, and they were in all parts of the colony. This aid has this year (1SS8) been discontinued, but I trust it may soon be renewed. In connection with the subject of education in New Zealand, there is a remarkable sign of educational activity in social and political matters, shown in the number of newspapers which are wholly sup ported by the colonists themselves. There are more than twenty daily newspapers, and there are also many published once or more often each week. Every small centre of population has at least one news paper of its own to make known the capabilities and wants of the district, and to state its views on public affiiirs. As a whole, the public press of New Zealand is creditable to its conductors ; and, in some instances, the newspapers are edited with remarkable ability. The number of buildings used for public worship in 1886 was 1189, with accommodation for 256,151 persons. The number which usually attended was 161,033. There has been (with one slight exception in 1886) a gradual decrease in the proportion of charges and convictions to the whole population."], [345, "APPENDIX C. 323 The convictions for offences against the person were in the proportion of 1*90 per 1000 of the population in 1882, 1*57 in 1881, aud 1*39 in 1886. Those for offences against property wore 2-13 per 1000 in 1882, 2-11 in 1881, and 2*12 in 1886. A few words here on a receut experi- ment in New Zealand in connection with the punishment of crime will not be out of place. \" The First Offenders' Probation Act, 1886,\" embodying a conditional system of probation for first offences, a prin- ciple which has been tried with great success in the United States, was passed in 1886 by the New Zealand Legislature, and practically came into operation in October of that year. The Inspector of Prisons, in his report dated March 20th, 1888, writes in very favourable terms of the effect of the Act during the short time since it had been put in force. Attention was drawn in the House of Commons, in 1888, to the probable success of this system in New Zealand, with a view to the consideration of introducing a similar principle in the United Kingdom. To refer to another subject which has an intimate connection with the decrease of crime, I may say that the Registrar-General, in his report on the New Zealand statistics of 1886, refers to a steady decrease which had been going on during the last seven years in the consump- tion of spirits and beer per head of the population, and observes that the efforts of the aelvocates of temperance were apparently bearing fruit, although, doubtless, that decrease was partly due to a diminished purchasing power owing to the jjrevailing depression. Tables of the occupations of the people are necessarily only an approximate classification of industries. The term \"occupations\" is used for the purposes of the census in a broad as well as a technical sense, so as to include every one, man, woman, and child. In some cases the terms \" wife,\" \" widow,\" \"son,\" \"daughter,\" \"relative,\" etc., have to be used ; and in others descriptive terms, showing the position, or source of livelihood. Tabulation of this kind, the Registrar-General observes, is most difficult and complex work. For my present object, it is sufficient to take the general classes given by the Registrar-General, and at the same time to give the substance of some of his explanatory remarks. Class 1 is termed \" Professional,\" and contains two divisions \u2014 one comprising all persons serving in the general and local govern- ments, and in the protection of the country ; the other comprising professions, and persons engaged in literature, art, and science. Class 1 includes 12,484 persons, of whom 8939 are males and 3545 are females. Class 2 is \" Domestic.\" This class includes all wives and members of families who have no specified occupations, and servants. This class contains 372,723 persons, of whom there are 123,176 males and 249,547 females. The number of househedd domestic servants was 14,503, of whom 13,471 were females. In addition, 1262 females were acting as servants in hotels, clubs, and eating-houses. The number of female household domestic servants under 20 years of age amounted to 22*6 per cent, (or about 2 out of every 9) of the girls between 15 and 20 years of age. Class 3 is termed \" Commercial,\" and comprises all engaged in trade and in the carriage of goods. There are in this class 27,200 persons, of whom 26,318 are males and 882 are females. Class 4 is termed \"Agricultural.\" This term, the Registrar-General"], [346, "324 APPENDIX C. explains, is used in a very comprehensive sense, so as not only to include tillage of the soil, but also all pursuits incidental to dealing with land, and the rearing and maintenance of live stock ; and, he adds, it has also been made to include fishermen, as they are employed in catching one kind of living creature, and there is no other class in which they could be suitably placed. This class, in that extended sense, comprises 65,178 persons, of whom 64,259 are males and 919 females. The fishermen numbered 476, and were distributed over several fisheries, and employed 414 boats. It also includes 690 persons engaged in trying to diminish the rabbit pest by killing rabbits. Class 5 is termed \" Industrial,\" and includes all persons working or dealing in art or mechanical productions, in textile fabrics and fibrous materials, in food and drinks (except those engaged in board and lodging and hotel-keeping, included in the domestic class), in animal and vegetable substances, and in metals and minerals. The number of persons in this class is 76,427, of .whom the males are 66,879 and the females 9548. Chess 6, the last class, is termed \" Indefi nite and Non-productive. ' In this class are included 13,154 labourers not more accurately defined, and 3899 persons of other specified occu pations which from indefinite description could not be otherwise allo cated. Consequently, the numbers in the other classes are short by the number given for these vague descriptions, and also by a large proportion of those returned merely as labourers. The last order of this class embraces persons supported on charity, and also the criminal class, namely, prisoners, etc. The number in this last order is 4202, of which the criminal class numbered 599. Class 6 contains 21,991 persons \u2014 20,220 males and 1774 females. The number of persons whose occupations were not given, and who could not be included in any class, amounted to 2476, of whom 2430 were males and 46 were females. The aggregate of the number thus classified and unclassified is 578,482 persons, the total population, exclusive of Maoris, of the colony when the census of 1886 was taken. The Maori census is always difficult to be taken, and the numbers given in it can only be regarded as more or less approximate to cor- rectness. This uncertainty is owing to obvious circumstances. Official enumeration, when applied to Maoris, is at present, very properly, not enforced or enforcible by law, for in that case it would probably occasion another war. It is a matter of diplomacy, and even so it is regarded by the race, as a rule, with suspicion and distrust. Even when information is vouchsafed, it is often, owing to native manners and customs, vague and inaccurate. Moreover, there are native districts in which the still unsettled state of affairs precludes the personal collection of a native census. The Maori census of 1S86 was taken with the greatest practi- cable care by or under the direct superintendence of officers of the Native Department, and under conditions which, no doubt, make it a comparatively closer approach to fact than any of its predecessors. At the same time, it cannot be held, for purposes of deduction and for other purposes, as reliable as the European census ; and this defect becomes, of course, the greater in cases of comparison with preceding Maori censuses, which, under the circumstances of the country, were necessarily taken with more inexactness. The number of the abori-"], [347, "325 APPENDIX C. ginal race in New Zealand, accoreiing to the census of 1886, was 41,969, of whom there were 22,840 males and 19,129 females. A Maori census (so called) was conjecturally taken in 1878, which gives the native population as 43,595. The Maori census of 1881, which, compared with that in 1878, is much less unreliable, gives the native population as 44,097, of whom 24,368 were males and 19,729 were females. Com pared, therefore, with the census of 1881. the census of 18S6 shows, since 1881, a decrease of 2128 Maoris\u2014 1528 males and 600 females. The Registrar-General, who has gone very carefully into the sta tistics of the Maori census, states that this decrease bears out the remarks of the several census superintending officers that there was, on the whole, a decrease of the natives within their districts. This \u2022decrease is attributable, partly, to inattention to sanitary habits, to exposure, to improper food, to drink, and to placing the sick in the hands of their native doctors instead of applying to the European medical officer of the district, and also, partly, to constitutional feeble ness caused by the practice of intermarriage between members of the same tribe or sub-tribe. It is, however, gratifying to learn from the Registrar-General, that \"there is, on the other hand, a marked decrease in their general drinking habits, this result having been, apparently, owing to the exertions of influential members of their own race, who have realised the serious consequences of indulging in habits of intem perance.\" This statement of the Registrar-General is fully borne out by the general tenor of the reports of officers of native districts, before referred to by me in my descriptive sketches of the provincial districts in the North Island. The conclusions to which the Registrar-General comes on the sub ject of the vitality of the Maori race are \u2014 \" 1. That there is a much smaller birth-rate among the Maoris than among the rest of the population. \"2. That there is a higher death-rate at all the younger ages of life; and \" 3. That there is in addition a much higher death-rate among the adult Maori females than among the adult males. These conditions,\" he adds, \" will have to be reversed before any increase of the race can reasonably be expected.\" The number of Maoris living in the North Island was 39,527, of whom the males were 21,649 and the females 17,878. Those living in the South Island were 2046\u2014 males 1088, and females 958. In the Chatham Islands, as I have before stated, the number of Maoris was 159, and the number of Morioris was 36, of whom, in both cases, the sexes were almost equally divided. Throughout New Zealand the Maoris owned, in addition to horses, 112,850 sheep, 42,103 cattle, and 92,091 pigs. The number of native schools in operation at the end of 1887 was 79, and there were also four boarding-schools, to which a considerable number of the more advanced pupils are sent. Of the 79 schools, 67 were ordinary village schools, and 12 were either subsidised or sub sidiary schools. The number of scholars on the books of the ordinary native schools in December, 1887, was 2631, as against 2340 in the previous year. The working average for 1887 was 2247, and for the"], [348, "326 APPENDIX C. fourth quarter 2095, of whom there were 1 189 boys and 906 girls. The working average for the year shows au average daily attendance of 84 per cent. \" This indicates,\" the Minister of Education observes in his annual report, May 5th, 1888, \" a regularity of attendance superior to that of the pupils of the public schools, except those of Otago, where the average daily attendance is 84*5 per cent., to be compared with 81 per cent, in Maori schools.\" The expenditure on native school build ings during 1887 was \u00a35657; and the other expenditure during that year on native schools was \u00a316,117. The Inspector of Native Schools reports favourably on the condition and progress of these schools. The criminal calendar includes few Maoris. During 1886, one was convicted before the Supreme Court for an offence against the person - twelve for offences against property ; and five for miscellaneous offences. The summary convictions, criminal and civil, of Maoris before magistrates were 277. The summary of civil cases, during 1886, in which Maoris were concerned, shows the extent to which civil resort to law was had mutually by members of both races, or by Maoris among themselves. The number of cases in which Europeans were plaintiffs and Maoris were defendants was 1182 ; the number in which Maoris were plaintiffs and Europeans were defendants was 91 ; aud there were 119 cases in which Maoris only were concerned. I propose now to say a few words on the trade and production of New Zealand. The number of registered sailing vessels which belonged to the colony on the 31st of December, 1887, was 389, with an aggregate of 51,512 tons ; and of steamers, 168, with an aggregate of 39,515 tons. The total value of the imports during the; year 1887 was \u00a36,215,515, a decrease on the value of imports -during 1886 of \u00a3513,198. The total value of the exports during 1887 was \u00a30,866,169, being an increase of \u00b1193,378 over the value of exports during 1886. As returns for isolated years of colonial trade necessarily convey au imperfect idea of its general nature and extent, I take a large space of time, and classify in groups the countries to and from which trade has flowed during that time. For the sake of convenience the trade with Hongkong is classed with China, and the trade with Fiji and Nor folk Islands is included in the Pacific Islands, and not under the head of British possessions. Accordingly, I make a retrospect for eleven years, and I begin with imports. During the year 1877, New Zealand imports amounted altogether to \u00a36,973,118. The value, during that year, of its imports from the United Kingdom was \u00a31,115,514. During 1887, the total value of New Zealand imports was \u00a36,245,515, and the value of imports from the United Kingdom was \u00a34,173,497. In 1877, the value of imports into New Zealand from other colonies and British possessions was \u00a32,392,209; and in 1887, the value of imports from those countries was \u00a31,249,457. The value of its imports from China and Hong kong increased from \u00a356,015 in 1877 to \u00a3186,870 in 1887. From the United States, the increase was from \u00a3209,656 to \u00a3298,736 in 1887. From other foreign states, the increase w-as from \u00a32205 in 1887 to \u00a3195,251 ; and from islands in the Pacific and the southern whale-"], [349, "APPENDIX C. 327 fisheries, the value of imports rose from \u00a337,405 in 1877 to \u00a3141,704 in 1887. The fluctuation of the trade in imports during this undecen nial period is interesting and suggestive. The total value of imports into New Zealand had diminished during the last year by \u00a3727,903, and only a small increase of \u00a357,953 had taken place in imports from the United Kingdom. The value of imports from other colonies and British possessions had fallen off ley about 50 per cent. The value of imports from the United States had increased a little ; hut, on the other hand, the value of imports from China and Hongkong had increased more than threefold, and from other foreign -countries the increase had been enormous, having risen from \u00a32205 to \u00a3195,251. Those other foreign countries are, of course, chiefly the continental states of Europe, and among them, as an exporting state, Germany stauds pre-eminent, inasmuch as the imports from that country had risen from \u00a316,375 in 18S5 to \u00a368,532 in 1887. Treating similarly the exports from New Zealand for the same eleven years, I find that their total value eluring 1877 was \u00a36,327,472, and that during 1887 it was \u00a36,866,169. The value of exports to the United Kingdom had decreased from \u00a35,321,499 in 1877 to \u00a31,847,413 in 1887 ; but this decrease is attributable to the less prices which were obtainable for wool and grain respectively in 1S87, notwithstanding that the bulk of both exported had greatly increaseel. The value of exports in 1877 to other colonies antl British possessions was \u00a3861,157, and in 1887 it was \u00a31,467,501. The value of exports to China and Hongkong had decreased from \u00a339,863 in 1877 to \u00a319,067 in 18S7 ; to the United States, it rose from \u00a327,858 in 1877 to \u00a3409,480 in 1887, and to other foreign countries, from \u00a31023 in 1877 to \u00a329,401 in 1887. The exports to the Pacific Islands and the southern whale fisheries were valued in 1S77 at \u00a376,032, and in 1887 at \u00a393,603. Thus it will be seen that during the time mentioned the exports sent from New Zealand to other British colonies and possessions, to the United States, and to the Pacific Islands had greatly increased (enormously to the United States), and that the exports generally had increased in value by above half a million. Excluding the export of specie and of manufactures other than those of New Zealand, the total value of New Zealand produce, according to the convenient classification adopted by the local department of Trade and Customs, exported during 1887 was as follows: \u2014 The mine. \u00a3803,S00; the fisheries, \u00a37476; the forest, \u00a3507,923; animal and produce, \u00a34,419,966; agricultural products, \u00a3560,916; manufac- tures, \u00a365,188. Adding to these values the value of miscellaneous proelucts, \u00a3185,397, the aggregate value of New Zealand peoduce exported during 18S7 amounted to \u00a36,551,081. The value of wool exported during the year was \u00a33,321,074. The produce of the gold- fields, entered for duty for exportation during the year ending March 31st, 1888, was 191,961 ounces, valued at \u00a3762,877. The export of wheat during 1887 amounted in bulk to 630,214 bushels, and of oats to 3, 189,898 \"bushels. Coal was exported to the amount of 44,129 tons. The export of frozen meat still continued to increase. The amount and value in 1S87 were greater than in any previous year. As a proof of the rapid rise of this industry, it is only necessary to point out"], [350, "328 APPENDIX C. that in 1882, wheu the industry began, the quantity of frozen meat exported from New Zealand was 15,244 cwt., valued at \u00a319,339 ; and that during 1887 the quantity exported was 402,107 cwt., or 20,105 tons, valued at \u00a3455,895. At this rate of increase, New Zealand bids well to justify Mr. Mulhall's statement in 1882 (in \"England's New Sheep-farm \") that the New Zealand colonists \" can, without reducing their stock, or infringing its procreative power, send us about 100,000 sheep monthly \u2014 say, 30,000 tons of meat per annum, or five per cent, of the deficit that Great Britain must rover by importation from abroad.\" The export of butter during 1887 was in value \u00a354.921 ; aud of cheese, \u00a354,562. The number of cattle in the colony in 1886 was 895,611 ; of horses, 187,382 ; and of sheep, 16,677,145. The census of 1881 gave the number of sheep as 12,985,085. It is therefore satisfactory to find (in view of what Mr. Mulhall wrote) that an adequate rate of increase in sheep had been maintained. The rabbit pest, destructive as it was of pasture, caused at one time grave anxiety on that point. The magnitude of that pest may to some extent be measured by the number, 8,546,254, of rabbit-skins exported during 1880, and the number, 12,713,152, exporteel during 1887. The number of threshing machines in use within the colony in 1886 was 1033, of which 559 were worked by steam-power. There were also in use 7890 reaping machines, 30 steam ploughs, ami 20 steam harrows. A collection of agricultural statistics is made yearly in New Zealand in the month of February, in respect of cultivations on holdings above one acre in extent. The number of such cultivated holdings in February, 1888, was 31,713, showing an increase of 1111 in number beyond those in the last preceding year. Maori cultivations are not included. The total extent of land in cultivation (including grass town land and land broken up, but not in crop) amounted to 7,284,752 acres, showing an increase of the total area under cultivation of 448,550 acres on the area of 1887. The extent of land in sown grasses in 1887 was 6,096,325 acres ; of this quantity, 2,S84,007 acres had been previously ploughed, and 3,053,052 acres not previously ploughed had been surface-sown. The average rate of produce of grain per acre in 1887 for the whole colony was \u2014 of wheat, 24*89 bushels ; of oats, 30*9 bushels ; ami of barley, 25*94 bushels. The average produce of hay was 1*37 ton per acre; and of potatoes, 1*S8 tons per acre. The area of land returned in the census of 1886 as having been fenced was 16,253,797 acres. The extent of land in occupied holdings over one acre in area 'exclusive of land occupied by Maoris) was in March, 1SS6, 27,818,690 acres, being an increase on the area of similar holdings in 1881 (the last previous census year) of 1,003,221 acres. Of the above number in 1886, the freehold properties of the occupiers were in extent 11,728,236 acres ; 1,776,987 acres were rented by the occupiers from private individuals ; 857,753 acres were routed from public bodies ; 696,510 acres were held from the Crown for other than purely pastoral purposes (these include lands held on deferred payments and other systems of settlement); 10,771,616 acres were held from the Crown for pastoral purposes only ; and 2,017,588 actes were Maori lands or neelive reserves rented. There was considerable increase in the"], [351, "329 APPENDIX C. \u2022extent of freehold, the property of the occupier, which was greater than in 1881 by 1,419,066 acres. The number of occupied holdings exceeding pne acre in extent, but excluding holdings of Crown pastoral leases, in 1886, was 36,485, the area of which was 17,077,074 acres. The number of these holdings not in any case exceeding 320 acres in extent was 33,584. The numerical increase, as compared with the census of 18S1, was greatest in holdings up to 50 acres, but the proportionate increase was greatest in the number of holdings between 200 and 320 acres. Copious information has been published, under the authority of the New Zealand Parliament, on the subject of mines in the colony. The late Minister of Mines, Mr. W. J. M. Larnach, C.M.G., has taken great trouble in the collection of mining statistics. He issued in 1887 an elaborate \"Handbook of New Zealand Mines,\" containing much instructive information on the early history of mining in New Zealand, and showing the various gold, silver, coal, and other mineral workings, and the several methods adopted in mining and the treatment of ores. His yearly reports also impart much valuable knowledge on the progress of mining industry. I avail myself of statements on this subject in his latest report, dated October 8th, 1887, aud of later returns since his retirement from office. The quantity of gold entereel for exportation on which tluty has been paid in New Zealand from January, 1857, to the 31st of March, 1888, was 11,273,306 ounces, valued at \u00a344,251,612. The quantity for the year ending March 31st, 1888, was 191,161 ounces, valued at \u00a3762,877, showing a decrease in quantity from that for the last preceding year of 10,320 ounces. The gold-fields in the North Island maintained about the same rate of produce, while the west coast tnines in the South Island, and the mines in Otago, had decreased their products. The aggregate nominal capital of 141 companies engaged in gold-mining in the colony on the 31st of March, 1888, amouuted to \u00a36,189,718, of which the sum of \u00a31,217,118 was paid up. The total cost of plant and machinery then employed by the aid of private enterprise in gold and silver mining was \u00a31,375,112. To this sum should be added the cost of water-races and channels worked under the direction of the Government, amounting to \u00a3370,306, making a grand total of \u00a31,745,418 as the capital invested at that time in the cost of plant, machinery, water-races, etc., engaged in mining operations only for gold and silver. The number of men employed at that time as alluvial miners was 9332 ; and as quartz-miners, 2455, making a total of 11,787 men employed in gold mining. On the subject of quartz-mining, Mr. Larnaeh points out that the great obstacle to the better progress of this valuable industry consists in not having in use a proper and economical method of treating and reducing the complex and refractory ores with which portions of New Zealand abound, and for want of which by far the largest percentage of valuable metals contained in many of the ores, under the present system of treatment, is going to waste. The importance of schools of mines at mining centres throughout the colony has not been overlooked. Up to the date of Mr. Larnach's report, October 8th, 1887, twenty-four schools of mines had been"], [352, "330 APPENDIX C. established throughout the colony \u2014 five in the North Island, and the rest in the South Island. The silver produced during 1887 was \u00a33453, and antimony during the same year was \u00a33989, in value. The approximate total output of coal from all coal-mines in New Zealand since returns from coal-mines have been furnished is 4,618,937 tons. The output for 1887 was 558,620 tons, being an increase, chiefly in bituminous coal, above that of the preceding year of 24,267 tons. The local use of this product is steadily increasing, and the importation of it is proportionately decreasing. The number of collieries returned in the census of 1886 was 79, showing an increase of 28 since the census of 1881, and the number of hands employed had increased from 992 to 1448. New Zealand coal is used in coaling the direct steamers trading with England, the local steamers, and in the extension of manufacturing power within the colony. Digging for Kauri gum is an important industry, and gives, in the North Island, constant employment to a large number of the European and native population. Since the beginning of the year 1853 to the end of 1887, there have been dug and taken from the sites where gigantic Kauri forests grew in ages long past, 1 11,191 tons of this gum, valued at \u00a34,305,601. The quantity exported during 1S87 was 6721 tons, valued at \u00a3362,149, and there w-cre 1283 persons engaged in 1S86 in procuring the gum. The report of the Registrar-General of New Zealand on the census of 1886, and the tables appended thereto, give much valuable informa tion on the growth of local manufactories and works in the colony. Not only are authentic particulars furnished, but means of com parison are secured on the basis of the census of 1881 aud on that of 1886. The progress of these industries, as shown by that comparison, has been great. In 1881, they were 1643 in number, employed 17,938 persons, and had an aggregate value of capital invested in lands, buildings, machinery, and plant amounting to \u00a33,605,471. In 1886, the number of industries was 226S ; the number of hands employed 25,655 ; and the value of capital invested, \u00a35,697,117. There had thus been during the five years' interval an increase of 38 per cent, in the number of industries, of 43 per cent, in the number of hands employed, and of 58 per cent, in the value of capital invested. The value of the various articles manufactured or produced, and of the work done, including repairs, amounted to \u00a37,436,649, a sum exceeding the annual imports of the colony. But this amount, the Registrar-General states, includes \u00a3449,027, the value of gold from quartz and hydraulic mining, \u00a31700 rendered by antimony and manganese mines, and \u00a3255,326, the value of coal raised. I specify some of the more impor tant industries in respect of the number of hands employed and of the capital invested. Two hundred and sixty-eight saw-mills employed 5042 hands, and had capital invested to the amount of \u00a3964,095. One hundred and thirty-five printing works employed 2107 hands, with a capital of \u00a3331,723. The number of fellmongering, tanning, and scouring works was 97 ; the number of hands, 1093 ; and the capital, \u00a3138,750. Coach-building aud painting works numbered 87, employed 644 hands, and capital \u00a3106,238. Fifty-eight iron and brass foundries employed 1750 hands, and invested capital of \u00a314S,773. The value of"], [353, "331 APPENDIX C. all manufactures and work done by these foundries during 1885 was \u00a3351,739. The boot factories numbered 42, employed 1654 hands, and had invested capital of \u00a370.935. There were twenty gasworks, with 344 hands, and with invested capital of \u00a3656,405. Clothing factories were eleven in number ; one was in connection with a woollen mill, and ten employed 1209 hands and invested capital of \u00a337,530. Six woollen mills employed 867 hands, and had invested capital to the amount of \u00a3203,279. The most remarkable growth has taken pleiee in the industries of printing, coach-building, and ship aud boat build ing. The woollen factories used 1,924,932 lb. of wool in 1885, aud the value of their manufactures in that year was \u00a3194,311. These figures, however, only represent the work of four factories, as two started in 1886. Two other factories, one in Auckland and one in Wellington, were in course of construction in March, 1886. The latter in 1887 was in full work. The total value of manufactures for the eleven clothing factories tluring 1S85 was \u00a3237,781. Cheese and butter factories came into existence in the colony since 1881. Their number in 1886 was 36; they employed 110 hands. The produce for 1885 from 33, for three were not then at work, was 823 tons of cheese, 274,6171b. of butter, and 16 tons of bacon, with an aggregate value of \u00a343,094. With regard to breweries, the Registrar-General draws a conclusion, probably with truth, favourable to some extent to the growth of temperance. The number of breweries had not increased in 1886 from that in 1881, but had diminished by one ; aud the pro duction, which for 1880 was equivalent to 9*80 gallons per head of the population, was for 1885 only at the rate of 8*4 gallons per head ; nor was this reduction compensated for by larger imports of spirituous liquor during that year, for in fact there was less entered for con sumption in 1885 than in 1880. The total consumption of beer in 1885 was thus 1*6 gallon per head les3 than in 1880. At the same time some allowance should be made, as in the case of spirits, for decreased consumption owing to monetary depression. The social activity of New Zealantl is shown in the following statistical items of interchange. The number of post-offices in the colony at the end of 1887 was 1117, and, exclusive of post-cards, 18,711,329 letters were posted and 20,066,445 were delivered during the year. The number of newspapers posted during the same time was 7,250,148, and 8,131,175 delivered. During the year, 159,597 money orders were issued for the ameeunt of \u00a3555,741. The average time in 1887 within which mails were delivered between London and New Zealand was, by the San Francisco service, 37 days, anel by the Direct Service, 11 days. There were at the end of 1887 within the colony 1616 miles of telegraph line open, and 1,835,391 messages were transmitted in the year. On March 31st, 1888, 33 bureau offices were open in connection with telephone exchanges. Arrangements were, in June, 1888, on the eve of completion for establishing foreign Parcel Posts, and, in all probability before the close of 1888, this useful ser vice will be established between New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Under the head of \" Accumulation,\" the following information is in teresting. The total average liabilities and assets of the banks within the colony .during 1886, as furnished in the returns required by law"], [354, "332 APPENDIX C. was, in round numbers, liabilities, \u00a311,603, 191 ; and assets, \u00a319,011,827. The total paid-up capital at the end of the year was \u00a35,750,000, and the aggregate amount of the reserve funds at the time the last dividend was declared was \u00a33,398,023. The number of post-office savings banks at the end of 1887 was 283 ; and at that time there remained open 79,721 accounts, with a credit of \u00a31,813,081. There were seven ordinary savings banks (not connected with the post-office savings banks) in the colony at the end of 1886, in which the total deposits amouuted to \u00a3517,801, and the number of open accounts was 16,125. There were seven life assurance companies doing business in the colony in 1886, exclusive of the Life Insurance Department of the New Zealand Government. The gross amount insured by policies taken out in the colony and existing at the end of 1886 was, in round numbers, \u00a313,172,310, of which the amount of \u00a36,670,711 was insured in the Government Insurance Department. Returns made to the Registrar of Friendly Societies show that the number of members belonging to the various fricnelly societies in the colony on December 31st, 1886, was 21,679, and that the total value of the assets of these societies on that date was \u00a3331,675, out of which the value of the sick and funeral benefit funds amounted to \u00a3295,667, and the value of the management funds was \u00a323,806 in amount. New Zealand finance is, as I have already had occasion to say, a question of grave importance in considering the position and prospects of the colony. In giving a statement of the latest facts on this subject, I shall first briefly refer to one general principle which materially affects the aspect of the whole case, and which cannot fairly be ignored. That principle is the just application of argument. And to give practical effect to that principle, the critic, in this particular case, must ever make proper allowance for what underlies the whole question, namely, the fact that the subject of finance is a young colony with immense and almost wholly undeveloped resources, enormous in proportion to its present small and sparse population. This fact, though it cannot justify financial extravagance, should much modify the view we might otherwise be disposed to take of the public debt of New Zealand. Granted that that debt has been mainly, if not wholly, incurred in laying out money on what may properly be termed reproductive purposes, such as the increase of population, the promotion of settlement, and the development of resources, the propriety of that public debt is at once reducible to a question of degree. Has the money which that debt represents been so expended as to become, in a public point of view, an actual or probable gootl investment ? The correct reply to that question will, in the case of Jn'cw Zealand, be best ascertained by an intelligent and impartial investigation of the state of the colony from time to time. Take as landmarks particular periods in the life of the colony, and note whether or not the tide is advancing. Is the colony, in spite of the burden of its debt, and in spite of temporary depressions, making substantial progress ? Are those who guide its destinies striving to curtail needless expenditure, and to use borrowed money to permanent advantage? Should affirmatives be able to be truly given to these questions, the fair inference is that the public debt has more or less tended to promote lasting prosperity. Of course the indispensable conditions arc that the debt is within reasonable* limits, in view of all"], [355, "333 APPENDIX C. its surroundings, and that the expenditure has been properly adminis tered. The fulfilment of these conditions is open to argument. All my present contention is that discussion of the subject should proceed on those lines, and that the mere existence of the large public debt should not by itself be held to-be its absolute and summary condemna tion. In the case now in question it is not enough to consider the debt alone relatively to the number of the population, as a simple sum of arithmetic, and to take no thought of anything else. The subject should be treated on broader and more statesmanlike grounds, more especially in relation to the progress of settlement and to the resources for the development of which the debt has been incurred. Take an instance from private life. Ten persons each borrow \u00a3100, and spend the sums unprofitably. Another person borrows \u00a31000, and invests the amount advantageously to himself; he owes ten times as much as each of the twenty, but he would be better off. The net indebtedness of New Zealand on the 31st of March, 1S8S, was \u00a335,196,000, carrying with it an annual charge of about \u00a31,767,200. Of this total sum, the expenditure, since 1870, out of the emigration and Public Works Fund has been, in round numbers, \u00a327,000,000. The chief items are, roundly \u2014 immigration, \u00a32,123,000 ; railways, \u00a311,570,000; roads, \u00a33,300,000 ; telegraphs, \u00a3513,000 ; waterworks on gold-fields, \u00a3510,000; public buildings, \u00a31,652,000; lighthouses, harbour works, and harbour defences, \u00a3826,000 ; and native land pur chases, \u00a31,115,000. These items aggregately amount to \u00a321,669,000, and substantially represent more or less reproductive assets. Rail ways, telegraphs, lighthouses, harbour works, public buildings, water works on gold-fields, and native land purchases are public property capable of realisation at any time. The length of railways opened up at the end of March, 1888, was 1758 miles, and 161 miles were under construction. The net revenue earned on the 31st of March, 1888, represented then \u00a32 6s. per cent, on the estimated cost of the opeued lines. The administration of the railway system has now been, or is about to be, placed under the control of an independent board, and a fair increase in the net yield is expected to result. At the end of 1887, there were 4716 miles of telegraph lines. The net earnings eluring that year were equal to 5*97 per cent, on the capital cost. The colony had made, up to the 31st of March, 1888, 1591 miles of dray roads and 3881 miles of horse roads, altogether 8178 miles, exclusive of a large mileage of roads made by local authorities. It had built 791 bridges. All this work, in addition to the construction of railways, has been done to open the country for occupation and settlement. To this work is mainly attributable the result that there are nearly 37,000 separate holdings above one acre, 21,000 of which are freehold. The duty of taking part with the rest of Australasia in naval defence has imposed a heavy cost of more than \u00a3100,000 for harbour defences, \u00a3200,000 being for heavy guns and armament sent out from England ; and under the naval agreement between the Imperial Government and the Australasian Governments, arranged at the Colonial Conference in 1887, New Zealand will pay during the next ten years its due share of contribution to her Majesty's fleet in Australian and New Zealand waters. A serious deficiency in the ordinary revenue had, no doubt, been"], [356, "334 APPENDIX C. caused by the commercial depression which has existed continuously since 1882. The New Zealand Legislature and Government have set themselves energetically at work to meet difficulties. In the ordinary expenditure of administration for the financial year 1888-89 retrench- ments have already been made to the amount of \u00a3233,000. Sub- stantial reductions had been effected in the salary and allowances of the Governor (to begin on the appointment of a new Governor), of responsible Ministers of the Crown (to begin at once), and in the allowances paid to members of the New Zealand Parliament, and in other directions. So earnest was the Legislature in applying the rule of economy to itself, that in December, 1887, it passed an Act that in the next Parliament the House of Representatives should then and thereafter consist of seventy-four members in place of the present ninety-five members, thus saving altogether the allowances and ex- penses of twenty-one members at each session. Such a self-lessening Act is, so far as I know, unparalleled in the history of representative legislation. Increased taxation accompanies retrenchment. The property-tax was raised to Id. in the \u00a3 ; and there has been raised, in addition to a special duty of 1 per cent, on imports for two years, an additional revenue through the customs. Within certain districts Maori lands, which had hitherto escaped taxation almost wholly, were subjected to rates and taxes as well as land owned by Europeans. An amending Land Act was passed, with the object of encouraging settle- ment and improving the laud revenue. A new 1 per cent, loan of two millions has just been placed on the London market. Of this sum, one million consists of the loan which was authorised in 18S2 for the construction of the main trunk rail- way through the centre of the North Island. The temporary deben- tures of that loan, to ,the extent of half a million, which have been issued during the progress of constructing the line will be paid off out of the new loan. The other million is to be applied, one-half to rail- ways, and about \u00a3120,000 to roads, purchase of native lands, telegraph extension, and the completion of harbour defences, leaving about \u00a380,000 to be allocated. The Government of New Zealand have authorised the loan agents to notify that after this new loan of two millions has been raised, no new loan will come upon the London market for three years from the 31st of March, 1888; but the right is reserved of raising money for the redemption of securities already in existence, and of carrying on the conversion of any outstanding loan. Unless some entirely unforeseen aud unexpected drop in the revenue takes place, no local borrowing of any large sum will be required during those three years. Tenders were received at the Bank of England on the 7th of June, 1888, for this Four Per Cent. New Zealand Loan. The total amount offered was \u00a38,021,000, the loan being thus sub scribed fully four times over. The average price obtained for the stock is \u00a397 15s. Id. One thing is evident. Notwithstanding the creation since 1870 of the main part of the public debt, and the exist ence of recent temporary depression, the credit of the colony has increased in the English money market.

Credit in a young country is the barometer of progress."], [357, "335 APPENDIX. C. I conclude my account of the financial position of the colony with au appropriate extract from the finaucial statement, on the 10th of May, 18S7, of the then Colonial Treasurer, Sir Julius Vogel. The return to which he referred may be accepted as reliable, inasmncb as it is founded on an exhaustive and accurate property-tax assessment just previously made. The extract is as follows : \u2014 \" I have had a return very carefully prepared, showing the assets anil liabilities of the colony ; it does not include such works as roads and bridges. It shows, under the head of assets, real property, \u00a3116,376,659; personal property, \u00a382,510,315; Government property, \u00a319,377,985; making a total of \u00a3218,294,959. On the other side liabilities : debt of the colony less sinking fund, \u00a331,688,319 ; debts of local bodies, \u00a35,616,273 ; debts represented by mortgages, \u00a331,821,109 ; indebtedness, exclusive of mortgages, \u00a320,365,593 ; amounting in all to \u00a389,191,321, and leaving a surplus of \u00a3128,803,635, or divided amongst the population, exclusive of Maoris, it shows a surplus of \u00a3223 for each man, woman, and child in the colony. It has also to be remembered that native lands outside the five-mile limit (namely, beyond five miles from any road suitable for horse traffic) are not in cluded in the assets.\" A tabular analysis of New Zealand annual revenue and expendi ture, from the first British Agency in New Zealand in 1832 to the 31st of March, 1888, compiled by Mr.\" James Edward Fitzgerald, C.M.G., the Controller and Auditor-General of the colony, has been presented to the local Legislature. These analytical tables, remarkably clear and simple in their construction, form a very suggestive and valuable State paper, which contains authentic material for elaboration into a com plete financial history of New Zealand. For instance, in the words of the compiler, \" the expenditure on military services should tell the tale of our native wars ; and the expenditure on the charges of the public debt, and on the legislative and civil services, wouM form an interesting record of the advance of the colony in various directions.\" Among other deductions which can be drawn from these tables, but for which I have not space, it appears that from 1860, when the Waitara war began, to the end of 1887, all the ordinary cost, for the period of 1860-61, of the Government, comprising legislative, civil, military, marine, native, and postal departments, but excluding public works, railways, education, and immigration, has diminished from an average amount of \u00a33 5s. to \u00a31 19s. 5d., for the period of 1885-87, per head of the population. Again, during the finaucial year 1871-72, when the public works policy, on a large scale, was first undertaken, the cost of native land purchases, public works, railways, and immi gration amounted to \u00a3448,177 13s. 9d., or to an average cost of \u00a31 13s. 6d. per head of the population ; and during the financial year 1887-88 the cost of those services was \u00a31,535,244, and yet only an average cost of \u00a32 7s. Gd. per head of population. Reproductive ex penditure thus had more than trebled itself, while only a little more than one-third had been added to the cost per head. The average amount of revenue raised by taxation for the period 1885-87 was \u00a34 2s. 7ei. per head of population ; and of payment of interest and sinking fund was \u00a32 15s. Gd. per head during the same period."], [358, "336 APPENDIX D. Summary \u2014 Chief Land Begulations, New Zealand. The Crown lands in New Zealand are administered under the authority of \"The Land Act, 1885,\" and \"The Land Act Amend ment Act, 1887.\" The colony is divided into ten land districts, each being under the local direction of a commissioner and a Land Board. I have already referred to the Land Offices in my descriptive sketch of the provincial districts. It is with these Land Offices that the selector of land has to transact all business, from the first consultation of the maps, the subsequent selection and purchase of land, to the final receipt of the Crown grant. Crown lands are divided into three classes : \u2014 1. Town aud village lands, being the sites heretofore reserved or which shall be hereafter reserved as sites for towns and villages. 2. Suburban land, being land in the vicinity of town lands. 3. Rural lands, being lands not reserved for towns and villages or other public purposes, and comprising all other lands not mining, whether agricultural, pastoral, or forest. The following is a brief summary (extracted from the New Zealand Handbook officially issued in April, 1888, by the Emigrants' In- formation Office, 31, Broadway, Westminster, London, S.W.) of the various systems of dealing with Crown lands, as established by the Act of 1885, alterations by the Amendment Act of 1887 being noted at the end of the numbered section or sections to which they refer. 1. System of Immediate Payment (area restricted by Amendment Act to 640 acres of first-class land and 2000 acres of second-class land, including other property held). Town lands sold by auction. Minimum upset price, \u00a330 per acre, or \u00a37 10s. per quarter-acre section. Suburban lands sold by auction in sections from 2 to 20 acres. Minimum upset price, \u00a33 per acre. Village lands (sections under 1 acre) offered on application at \u00a35 per section. Village lands (termed \" small farms,\" 1 to 50 acres) offered on appli cation at not less than \u00a31 per acre. Rural lands, sold by auction or on application, up to \u00a32 per acre, according to quality. 2. Deferred Payment System (area restricted to 320 acres). feuburban lands, sold at \u00a34 10s. per acre. Rural lands, sold at not"], [359, "337 APPENDIX D. less than \u00a31 per acre, except in certain parts, where the price may be less according to quality. Village lands, sections under 1 acre, ami small farms, 1 to 50 acres, not less thah \u00a31 per acre. The deferred payments are made in equal instalments every six months over a period of five years for suburban land, and ten years for rural land. Certain conditions of cultivation, fencing, and other improvements are attached in each case. 3. System of Lease for first term of 30 years, with perpetual right of renewal at intervals of 21 years (area restricted to 640 acres, including other property held). Leases of land set aside for this purpose are put up to public com petition by tender at an upset rental of 5 per cent, on the capital value, usually \u00a31 per acre, with right of purchase (if outside gold-fields) after six and within twelve years, if conditions have been complied with. [By the Amendment Act of 1887 all rural lands open for sale or selection shall be opened under either of the systems numbered above, 1, 2, and 3, at the option of the purchasers. Also persons holding land under deferred payment or perpetual lease may, so soon as they have fulfilled the conditions of cultivation, etc., acquire the freehold on paying the full price of the land, or so much thereof, in the case of land held under deferred payment, as shall not have been already paid by them.] 4. Homestead System (area restricted to 200 acres per family or house hold). Only certain lands are open to selection for this purpose ; no pay ment required. Only cost to settler is that of survey. On the fulfil ment of the conditions \u2014 five years' residence, the erection of a house, and the cultivation of one-third of the selection if open land, and one fifth if bush land \u2014 the Crown grant is issued. 5. Special Settlements. Any number of persons (not less than 25) may obtain, on approval, the privilege of selecting a block of land on which to settle adjacent to each other, but subject to all conditions of the deferred payment, or perpetual lease systems, as the case may be. 6. Village Settlement System (area restricted to 50 acres). Lands in suitable localities are let on perpetual leases, with right of purchase. The rental is interest at 5 per cent, on the purchasing prices. The great advantage of this system is that, by securing a few acres under it, a man need never be a day idle, for, when he cannot get work for wages in his district, he can find plenty to do in improving his own place. 7. Agricultural Lease on Gold-fields. In force in Otago. Permits of lam I are made available for agriculture, while liable to be taken for mining purposes. Upset price, \u00a31 per acre. 8. Small Grazing Runs (area not exceeding 5000 acres). Such runs are let by public auction for a term of 21 years, with right of renewal for a second term of 21 years. The lessee has the exclusive right of the natural pasturage, and may cultivate any or all of the area leased. At the end of the term of lease, full valuation is allowed for improvements. The upset price is 2J per cent, on capital value. Recent sales realised from 3d. to Is. Sd. per acre. [By the Amendment z"], [360, "338 APPENDIX D. Act of 1887 the area of small grazing runs is extended to 20,000 acres, provided the Surveyor-General shall certify that the land is not suitable for occupation as small runs in less areas.] 9. Pastoral Runs. These comprise about 11,000,000 acres of natural pasturage, and are let in large areas of from 5000 acres upwards for terms not exceeding 21 years. The average rental is about id. an acre. Twelve mouths before a lease falls in the run is offered for sale by auction for another term. Valuation, not exceeding three years' rental, is allowed the out going tenant for improvements. There is no restriction as to the number of runs which may be leased by one person or a company. Gold-Mining on Crown Lands. \u2014 The general law, the Mines Act of 1877, amended by subsequent Acts, authorises the constitution of mining districts, and requires miners' rights to be taken. Holders of miners' rights are authorised to prospect and search for gold in Crown lands in a mining district, and prospecting licenses for the same purpose outside mining districts can be issued. Licenses for the search of other minerals on Crown lands within mining districts may be granted. Provision is made for mining leases. Regulations respecting the granting of gold-mining and other mineral leases, etc., etc., are appended to the Act."], [361, "339 APPENDIX E. Summary of \" The Native Land Act, 1888.\" \" The Native Land Act, 1888,\" passed on the 30th of August, 1888, repeals \"The Native Land Administration Act, 1886,\" and empowers the natives to alienate and dispose of their lands as they think fit, subject to the provisions of two Acts passed respectively in 1881 and 1888 for the prevention of fraiuls in the purchase of native lands. Some of those provisions are to the following effect : \u2014 1. A deed executed by a native shall have no effect as a conveyance or lease by such native of land, or of any estate therein, to a person not a native unless \u2014 (a.) A statement in the Maori language of the effect of such deed, certified as correct by a licensed interpreter, shall, before the document is signed by any native, be indorsed on, or form part of, the document ; (b.) The effect of such statement shall be explained to each native before signing the same ; (c.) The signature of each native shall be attested by at least two witnesses, one of whom shall be a judge, or a justice of the peace, or a solicitor of the Supreme Court, or a clerk of a resident magistrate's court, or a postmaster, and the other a male adult, who shall certify the date upon which such signature shall have been attached to such deed (none of whom shall be concerned in the transaction) ; (d.) There shall be a plan of the land delineated on the document before it shall be signed by any native. Half-castes, who are certified by a justice of the peace to have sufficient knowledge of the English language to understand such deed, are placed on a footing with Europeans in regard to the execution of legal formalities in respect of that deed. 2. Every Trust Commissioner shall hold a public court to investigate cases brought before him in pursuance of the Native Lands Frauds Prevention Acts ; and if, upon due inquiry, the Trust Commissioner is satisfied that the alienation of the native land in question is not invalid according to the true intent of those Acts ; that the consideration pur porting to be paid or given has been paid or given ; that the natives interested in the land the subject of alienation have sufficient land left for their occupation and support ; and that the instrument of alienation is executed with the requisite formalities, he shall indorse on that"], [362, "340 APPENDIX E. instrument a certificate under his hand to that effect. No deed or other instrument of alienation shall be registered in any registry of deeds or land, or lodged with a Native Land Court Registrar, without such indorsement. 3. Dealings with native land are prohibited, unless such land is now owned under Crown grant, memorial of ownership, or certificate of title issued under either a Native Land Court Act, or a Land Transfer Act, to not more than twenty natives, or unless such land shall hereafter become and shall have been so owned for forty days. 4. A penalty not exceeding \u00a3500 is inflicted for entering upon prohibited dealings ; and prohibited transactions are made illegal and void. 5. The rights of the Crown are not prejudiced."], [363, "341 APPENDIX F.

Note 1. \u2014 This office has been establishetl under the supervision of the Colonial Office for the purpose of supplying intending emigrants with useful and trustworthy information respecting emigration to the British Colonies. The information issued to the public is mainly obtained from the various Colonial Governments and their representa tives in this country. No pains are spared to make the information as accurate as possible, but the Committee of Management cannot under take to hold itself responsible for the absolute correctness of every detail.

The steamers of the New Zealand Shipping Company, and Shaw, Savill, and Co., run once a fortnight from London and Plymouth for Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington, and Auckland, taking the Cape of Good Hope route and calling at Hobart in Tasmania. Passengers by any other steamers have to tranship at one of the Australian ports, and this often involves delay and expense. The Passenger Act, 1855, and other Acts, require passenger ships carrying emigrants to be seaworthy, have proper accommodation, fur- nish good and sufficient food, provide medicines, and on large ships a surgeon, and in other ways to protect the interests of emigrants. Short summaries of these regulations are posted up in every ship. Emigrants who find they are not being treated fairly- should immediately com- plain. Passengers by the North German Lloyd and other companies whose vessels do not clear from English ports are not protected by these regulations. The passage money by steamer varies from \u00a363 to \u00a373 10s. first class, from \u00a336 15s. to \u00a312 second, and from \u00a316 16s. to \u00a321 third. These fares are for Port Chalmers for Dunedin, Port Lyttelton for Christchurch, Wellington or Auckland, and some other ports. The fares are very liable to change ; it is therefore advisable to consult the advertisements in the daily newspapers for the fares at any given time. For first and second class the passage money covers every requisite, except beer, wines, and spirits, but the third-class passengers must provide their own bedding and mess utensils. (These will be supplied if wanted at the cost of \u00a31.) Third-class passengers by steamers are allowed 15 cubic feet of luggage free ; by sailing ships the amount varies. Two boxes, each 2 feet 6 inches long, 2 feet broad, and 1 foot 6 inches deep, make up 15 cubic feet, but any sized boxes will do, so long as 15 cubic feet are not exceeded. Luggage required for use on the voyage should be marked \" Wanted.\" The fares by sailing vessels are from \u00a336 15s. to \u00a315 3s. first class, from \u00a321 second class, and \u00a313 13s. to \u00a315 15s. third. As a rule, children from 3 to 12 years of age are half-price by both steamers aud sailing ships. One child under 3 years free. If more than one under 3, one-qu;irter fare each, exclusive of the one taken free.

Particulars as to the ships and berths, with the addresses of the brokers or owners, can also be obtained from the advertisements in the principal London and provincial newspapers. No large outfit is necessary, nor need it be new. Emigrants having knives, forks, spoons, bed and table linen, kitchen utensils, sewing machine, light tools, and other small articles or ornaments, should take them, but not heavy furniture nor rough common tools, as free luggage is limited. Emigrants should take all the clothes they have, but not less, if possible, than the following for the voyage and subse quent use. For males, two pairs of boots, one strong suit, two pairs of white or cool trousers, and one jacket of similar material, one cloth cap, and one broad-brimmed straw hat, one pair canvas shoes, and one overcoat, and six articles of each kind of underclothing. For females, two pairs strong shoes, one warm and two cotton gowns, one broad brimmed straw hat, and one close-fitting hat, one pair slippers, one cloak or shawl, six articles of each kind of underclothing, and sewing materials. For children, one warm cloak or greatcoat, four flannel waistcoats, two pairs strong shoes, two warm suits, and six to nine articles of each kind of underclothing. Two or three flannel shirts for men, and an extra supply of flannel for women and children, will be very useful. If the emigrant is going by sailing ship, extra warm clothing will be required. N.B. \u2014 There are not many opportunities for washing clothes on board. Any time in the year is suitable for arriving in the colony, but perhaps the best is in any of the three spring months, September, October, and November, for the North Island, and any time during the summer, from September to February, for the South Island.

There is no doubt that the almost universal depression of trade has given a temporary check to the prosperity of New Zealand. The towns have suffered, perhaps, more than the country. Almost all the mechanic and artisan trades are depressed, and the labour market in those trades is in great measure overstocked. But the country districts have felt it very severely also, and, although the returns still show \" moderate,\" \" fair,\" and, in some cases, \" good demand feel* labour,\" the pastoral and agricultural industries are not nearly so prosperous as they were two years ago. The low prices of all kinds of produce have brought great losses on many farmers, who, in con sequence, cannot give the high wages that have hitherto prevailed. But low prices and high wages are not the only causes of the \" depres sion.\" During the more prosperous times farmers were overanxious to add to their farms, and frequently not only paid too high a price for the land, but also borrowed on it at too high a rate of interest. One of the results of the limited demand for labour is the suspension (January, 1SS8), of the \" assisted \" passages which were, up to that time, granted by the New Zealand Government to a limited number of farmers and agriculturists with small capital. The \" nominated assisted\" passages, by means of which persons in the colony coulel nominate their friends on this side for assisted passages, are also sus pended. No free passages have been granted for some time. The regulations as to free and assisted passages are frequently altered, and the quarterly Circular issued by this Office, free of charge, should be consulted for the latest information on these passages, and on the demand for labour. Although at present there is no Government aid with respect to passages, there is Government organisation for the reception of immi grants on landing in the colony. The immigration officers, who give their services free of charge, are : \u2014 At Dunedin Mr. Colin Allan, at Christchurch Mr. J. E. March, at Wellington Mr. J. B. Redward, and at Auckland Mr. 0. Mays. At lnvercargill a voluntary Immigration Committee (Chairman, Mr. J. Macpherson) has recently been formed, to which emigrants should apply. Emigrants having no employment in prospect would do well to write, stating particulars of the kind of labour they require, and the ship they are coming in, to the immigration officer at the port of arrival, as above. In the smaller towns emigrants should apply for information at the Branch Land Departments. Emigrants having friends in the colony should apply to them beforehand. During 1886, 16,101 persons arrived in the colony, and 15,037 left."], [367, "345 APPENDIX F. The net immigration was therefore 1061. This is the smallest addition to the population of this country, from that cause, since 1868. The number of assisted emigrants, that is persons introduced into the colony partially at the New Zealand Government expense, was 917. These were all from the United Kingdom. Although the low prices of wool and wheat in the European markets necessarily affect seriously the trade of a country in which they are the staple products, it is, on the other hand, not very likely that serious distress should prevail in a country larger than Great Britain, with fertile soil, good climate, and a population not much larger than that of Devonshire. The depression that now exists in the colony bears no comparison with poverty and distress as it is known in England. Again, there is considerable reason to hope for better times. The price of wool is now being maintained, aud dairy produce shows signs of advancing in price. The goodness of the climate, the richness of much of the soil, the high average yield of wheat \u2014 over twenty-four bushels to the acre \u2014 the fact that New Zealand stands first of all the colonies in its sheep-bearing capacity, and that its mutton commands the highest price in the English market, all tend to make the colony most attractive to farmers and agriculturists generally, and to inspire the belief that there cannot be much doubt as to the future of those who are prepared for steady work, some self denial, and \"roughing it\" a little during their first years as colonists. Though there is not much immediate chance of making a large fortune in New Zealand any more than anywhere else, yet a comfortable living, a house in healthy surroundings, a fair start for their children, and a reasonable provision for their own future are within the reach of emigrants if they are careful and industrious. Artisans and mechanics are not in demand in New Zealand at present \u2014 the tendency to flock to the towns and stay there has overstocked the market for all kinds of such labour \u2014 but steady, careful men, willing and able to undertake farm work, who are prepared to go into the country districts, and turn their hands to anything they may find to do, are pretty sure to get on. Small capitalists again will find an opening, if they are prudent, and do not mind working for wages while they are looking about them, and gaining information as to the country and its capabilities. It is far better to be working for others until a reasonable amount of experience has been gained, justifying the investment of capital, than to take up land immediately on arrival in the colony. The small capitalist who intends to succeed as a farmer should also remember that he must himself work hard upon the land ; that, although it is often advantageous to buy land from colonists instead of taking up Crown lands, he mu6t not pay too high a price for it, nor be over anxious to extend his farm as soon as he finds he is succeeding. He should also be very careful as to borrowing on his land. With regard to buying land, it should be pointed out that lands are conveyed in a much more simple manner than in England, and that those purchased from settlers will be more accessible and more or less cleared and draiueel, while the Crown lands are for the most part not so easy of access, and require to be sown, fenced, etc. On the other hand, roads are being everywhere made, the climate is good, and the land once cleared speedily gives good returns. . . ."], [368, "346 APPENDIX F. There is still a decided demand for good hard-working agricultural labourers, although, owing to the depression, it is less than it was. The demand is more or less intermittent, but men taken on at harvest time, and found to be good men, are pretty certain to find places open to them at the end of the season. Men are usually employed and paid by the week, and fed and housed by the employer. The food is, as a rule, good, aud although the quarters are rough the good climate renders this of less importance. Single men are generally preferred to married. At the present time farmers are employing as few men as possible, as the present high rates of wages and low prices of produce make it impossible for them to employ more men without losing their chance of profit. Everywhere it is asserted that they would employ more men if they could, in ditching, fencing, clearing, and the various improvements, which are required in a uew country like New Zealand, in addition to bringing more land under the plough. One farmer, writing from the colony, says, \" The demand for labour here at present is almost entirely a question of price. The price of produce is too low to admit of a high wage, except for absolutely necessary work. Farmers have no money to farm high or improve their farms.\" This point is important, and shows that emigrants who would be con tent to take the prices which the farmers could afford to pay would be sure of work, at wages quite equal to the average in England, with food and lodging in addition. Before setting out to seek work in any district, they should, of course, inquire as to its character, and the demand for labour in it, and should bear in mind that in graziug districts there are necessarily fewer hands employed than in agri cultural districts. But even in the former it is often said that more land would be brought under cultivation if good labourers could be had at lower wages. As to professional employment. The local supply in the professions is as a rule quite equal to the demand. There is but little demand for governesses. Clerks and shopmen are specially warned that there is no opening for them, the supply in the colony being more than equal to the demand. The following table gives the latest returns from the colouy as to the rates of wages and the demand for labour : \u2014 Term. Wages. Demand for Labour.

Note 2. \u2014 A high rate of wages does not necessarily imply a demand for labour. Note 3. \u2014 The ordinary working day for artisans is eight hours. There is an opening in the colony for farmers with capital of a few hundred pounds and upwards (from \u00a32 to \u00a33 an acre, exclusive of clearing). Small capitalists, however, will probably find it to their advantage not to invest their capital until they have obtained experience on a farm in the colony. Cost of Living.

In Hawke's Bay, prices are much the same as in Auckland. In Westland (mining districts), prices are generally higher. Prices at the gold-fields in Otago are also higher than in the other parts of the district. Generally it may be said that actual necessaries, except clothing and groceries, are cheap, but everything beyond is high in price. The rent of a four-roomed house is estimated at about 12s. per week. In some districts, six-roomed houses, with verandahs, have been built for \u00a3200 each. Board and lodging can be had in Auckland at from 15s. to 17s. per week, Wellington 15s. to 20s., in Christchurch and Dunedin 15s. per week. Employment Acts. No person under 12 may be employed in a factory. No woman or girl, or child under 14, may be employed at night, nor for more than eight hours a day ; but a girl or boy over 14 may work in fruit preserving, fish-curing, and newspaper-printing establishments, and may be employed for 10 hours a day for four days a week. Proper ventilation and an interval every 4J hours for meals are enforced. The Act does not affect shopwomen. The Workmen's Wages Act facilitates the recovery of wages by certain classes of workmen. The Coal Mines Act, 1886, regulates mining leases, and enforces"], [372, "350 APPENDIX F. proper ventilation and all reasonable safeguards. No woman and no boy under 12 may be employed in or about a mine, and no boy under 14 may be employed underground. No person in charge of steam machinery in actual work may be employed for more than eight consecutive hours at any one time. If an accident or death is due in any degree to the negligence of the owner of the mine, the owner must make compensation. Wages may not be paid at a public-house. Similar provisions are made for the regulation of mines other than coal mines, by the Mining Act, 1886. There is an Employers' Liability Act similar to the one in force in England. Monet and Banks. English money is used throughout the colony. Money can be transmitted to the colony from the United Kingdom by money order. No single order is issued for more than \u00a310. Larger sums can be sent from England on application to any bank here having a branch in the colony. There are six joint stock banks \u2014 The Beink of New Zealand, bankers to the Government ; head office, Auckland; Lomlon office, 1, Queen Victoria Street, E.C. National Bank of New Zealand (Limited); head office, 71, Old Broad Street, London. Colonial Bank of New Zealand; head office, Dunedin; London agency, 13, Moorgate Street, E.C.
