Fishers gay let us sail away, Shines the sun bright to-day And the wind is fair, Softly sing by the shore And the waves from afar Will repeat our songs once more. (Enter Pifear). Pif Zephoris, Zephoris, where is Zephoris (to the Fishermen) Have you not seen him ? Omnes No, No ! Pif Oh Brahma, what bad luck. Omnes Why not fish without him ? Pif Without him it's quite impossible, Omnes Why ? Pif Because he couldn't fish without me Omnes What a funny thing. Tell us why, pray, tell us why. Pif Then listen : \u2014 SONG. Zephoris tho' he is the best of friends, A very bad fisher is he, But for me, all the luck that Brahma sends Would be lost again in the sea. As he keeps searching night and day For treasures and pearls which he never gets, And like a fool he throws away, Everything else that comes in his nets ; So while his fishing boat he empties, Why, I fill mine at my ease, So now you see why he cannot do withoutjme Zephoris is a handsome chap to see, But he lacks my dashing ways, The village beauties but for me Would surely laugh in his face, /&*&\u25a0"], [6, "2 Oft have I seen the darling creatures, Look shy at him as if to say : Don't you admire my pretty features, But the big stupid turns away ; So if I were not by his side, Then all these sweet kisses would be lost, So now you see why he can't do witnout me Pif But who comes here ? It is Ziz 1. 'Tis the inspector of our coast, he is hard, cruel and unjust, and should he find us here he would surely make us suffer, come let's away. Zezel O stop there, stay my charming friends. Before you go to fish, I want to question you; everyone shall have his turn, so I'll begin with thee. Pif Pray tell me what I've done that you begin with me. Zizei. Each one shall come in turn so I begin with thee my g(od friend Pilear. Of a dreadful offence, my grief is quite intense, yuu're guilty I find. Nay don't answer mind. An offence made like this requires a slight fine. So pay or to jail you will go. Pif But if to ask I am permitted, What offence have I committed? Zezel It has not been committed yet, that may be so, But you will offend some day I know. So pay the fine, give me the bail, or if not come to jail, ; (to Zelide) 'Tis now your turn. Come here my pretty one. Zelide Ob, dear me ! Zizel Of a dreadful offence ; (enter Zephoris) Back, 1 say ; Omnes Zephoris ! Zephoris Old man, by my faith if crime enormous there be It is this shameful trade carried on by thee ; Zizel Imprudent, ignorant man, do you wish me to quarrel with you ? Zelide Pity sir ; pity my brother don't let me plead in vain I Zephoris My sister ! cease to implore him, Plead no longer ! Not on his mandate my safety depends, Our generous king, whose arm is stronger, Will ne'er injure the brother who his sister defends. Chorus and All \u2014 Cease to implore, &c. Zizel To prison he must go, carry him away ; Omnes To prison ? Zelide Hear me, kind sir, do not harm my brother, he quite forgot to whom he was speaking ; He didn't mean to insult you, he knows well what respect is your due ;"], [7, "3 Zizel (to guards) release him a moment. Before I send prison, I will give you a moment to hear if you have any reason to make why to prison you should not go. Come look quick and give your reason plain (Zelide puts a piece of money in his hand) I almost relent now ( Zelide puts another piece of money in his hand). That is better (gives him another piece, to Zephoris). I now bear him no malice, your fault I pardon,' (to the fishermen). Now go to your work I permit you to fish, and my profits are good. Chorus \u2014 Fishers Gay, &c, Zephoris Stay Pifear, I wish to speak to you. Pif To me? Zephoris And also to you, my sister, (he takes their hands) Zelide What canst thou have to say to me ? Zephoris You cast down your eyes, you blush little sister, you know what I have to say to you ? Pif But I have not blushed ; I have not cast down my eyes ; I don't know what it is you have to tell us ? Zephoris Well, well, I will tell thee all my friend \u2014 There is a beautiful girl who is foolish enough to be in love with you ; Pif You call that foolish ? I think it is a matter of taste ; Zephoris However to me any weakness of heart is excusable, for does not my love overcome my reason so you have but to ask and I will give you her hand ? Pif Her hand, but what with it? Zephoris Ah ! you wish to know how much money we have ? Very well ask Zelide, for she holds the purse ; Pif Oh ! tell me Zelide how much is in it ? Zel (lowering her eyes) Nothing 1 We have Nothing ! Zeph Nothing Zelide ? But what has become of that left us by our father ? Zel Until now, I have kept silent, for fear of troubling you my brother, but to-day I do not wish to deceive anyone, and I will tell you the truth ; Zeph Speak ? Zel For a long time, dear brother, your fishing has been un- fortunate, and you have returned home so sad and down cast, that I could not reproach you, and I used piece by piece all the money that our father left us. Zeph Oh, pardon me, my sister ! pardon me ; Zel It is not your fault, if the fish don't come into your nets. Pif The fish ! Why if they come into'his nets he throws them out !"], [8, "4 Zel Does he ? Pif He won't have anything to io with whiting, he despises the mullet, and throws the turbot back into the sea. Zel Can it be true ? Pif What he wants is coral, or a bank of lovely pearls, or \u2014 he is a fool in short ! Zel Enough, enough. Then brother she whom you love is rich ? Zeph I don't know. It was on a beautiful summer evening, and while wandering alone on this shore ; suddenly I heard a cry of despair, and saw a young girl drowing. I jumped off a high rock into the sea to help her, and soon, the poor girl was safely in my ar as. For a long time I struggled against the current which was running with great force, but at last I brought her safely to this spot, and on these sands I placed her. I gazed on her till the voices of her friends roused me from my ecstacy. Ashamed of my appearance, I ran away to hide myself for I wished to spare her all embarrassment. Zel And have you never seen her again ? Zeph Never. Whether she is of humble birth like you my sister, or whether she is noble, I don't know. SONG. I thought not of her birth and station When in the waves I saw her helpless lie ; Had she been the lowliest in the nation, My heart had answered that despairing cry. More as a vision she seemed to me, Fair as an angel she looked to be. We cannot ask the bright Aurora, When her soft light through the darkness drear has striven, If the golden rays she sends before her Come to her from earth or lrom heaven. Daily on the shore I sadly linger, Having no guide to find her but this ring, Which, on the sands, dropt from her finger. This to my heart does some comfort bring. Once more to see her, oh, heavenly bliss, In my fond bosom no thought bat this. Zel Alas, poor Zephoris, where will your love lead you? Zeph Oh, a hundred times I have tried to forget it, but could not. Day and night her image is ever before my eyes. Pif Shut your eyes then ! Zeph But my dream is over now. Fond hopes, away! I wish to regain that which my selfishness has made yon lose. In two months, I will have refunded all that our father left us. In two months you shall be united. Zel My dear good brother (embraces him). Pif My dear brother-in-law (embraces Zeph. awkwardly, Zeph, repulses him). Zeph Come let us go."], [9, "5 Pif I cannot leave I have to wait here for a customer. Zeph To whom you sell fish? Pif No, he is a lord for whom I carry letters, love-letters I suppose, for which he gives me two pieces of gold. Zeph Love or treason, who knows? Pif Treason. Zeph I distrust the honesty of this lord; however, it is your affair. Pif I see my customer coming, so good-bye, Farewell. (exit Zel and Zeph). (enter Kadoor.) Kad Thou art punctual! It is well, but remember to be silent. Pif I will my lord, mute as a fish. Kad Very good, for if thou speakest a word I will cut off your head. Pif (aside, trembling) Cut off my head! Ah, Zephoris said truly, this looks like treason. Kad If thou servest me with discretion I will pay generously, this letter will be the last and for this I will give thee three pieces of gold. Pif Three pieces of gold ! Zephoris deceived himself, he must be a lover. Kad Stay, thou wilt take it to-morrow, when thou goest with the other fishermen. Pif Certainly, then to-morrow the fair lady will have the letter, for it is for a fair lady ? Kad Thou hast guessed rightly, but not a word Pif Not a single word. exit. Pif. Kad All goes well. This fisherman is a fool. He has not the least suspicion of the important mission I have charged him with. Sleep on in luxury, insolent King, thy enemy waits. But whom have we h. re ? 'Tis the King and our beautiful cousin. They will suspect something. I must keep to the plan and muBt see all is right. (Kadoor keeps out of King's way). Chorus. \u2014 Glory to Brahma.

Nemea Oh, King your spirit is divine, You have too much humility ; The little bird whose melody We have just heard on branching tree, The brook that flows so rapidly, Each tiny isle set in the sea, Each pretty flower the sun uncloses, Magnolias, jessamines and roses, These delights our walk discloses, All for our King has great Brahma made them King Nay, you mistake, sweet lady fair, The rippling brook that shineth there, And when you look on scenes so rare, On smiling Isles the seas doth lave, Each pretty flower the sun uncloses, Magnolias, jessamines, and roses ; These delights our walk discloses ; 'Tis for their beauty great Brahma made them. Chorus. \u2014 Glory to Brahma, &c. King Ah, it is our good cousin ! I was surprised at not seeing you amidst the lords of our court. But the presence of Nemea reassures me, and I just said to her : \" Princess, as thou art with me we shall not be long before we see the Prince Kadoor. Kad The flowers ever attract the bees ; Nemea And the wasps. Kad Princess, thou doest not like me, and perhaps it would'be wiser to renounce all idea of an alliance. Nemea I will tell thee frankly. Prince Kadoor, my heart I no longer possess. King Thou lovest another ? Kad And who is this man ? Nemea I don't know. Kad But, Princess \u2014 Nemea Listen, and thou shalt learn all. Some months ago I had a fancy for bathing at a place close by here. Suddenly an unknown current carried me away. I struggled, I screamed, and finally sank under the waves. When I came to myself I was lying on the sands. I asked my attendants who it was that savei me. They said, \" We have seen no one ; you must have been rescued by a messenger from heaven, who has vanished on our approach. King . Kadoor, do you believe that Brahma sent a messenger ? Kad I, thy Majesty ? Nemea Oh, I don't believe that Brahma sent a messenger. My rescuer may have come from a boat I had seen at a distance."], [11, "7 Kad If that is the only obstacle, Princess, I will dare to pre- dict that he who keeps silent now, from motives of discretion, will remain silent, out of respect for us, when we are married. Nemea So be it. He will not make himself known ; but, if I discover him, I shall break with you. Kad Then, Princess, this is your decision ? Nemea Yes. If he who saved me comes to me and repeats to me the words I cried out in my despair when I was drowning, if his Majesty permits it, Iwiilgive him my heart and hand. King (with feigned severity) And if I don't, Princess ? Nemea Then, your Majesty, I will withdraw my hand King (laughing) I understand. Nemea Is that not the Royal yacht I see in the distance ? King Yes, Princess. Nemea If your majesty likes we will continue our walk, while we wait for the yacht. King Very well. Wilt thou accompany us, Kadoor '? Kad No, your majesty, I have some orders to give ; I will at the same time see tho royal rowers. King Your hand, Nemea. (As they are going off Zephoris and Pif. enter at back.

Zeph She ? Kad And is it true that thou didst save her ? Zeph Yes, my lord. Kad How long ago ? Zeph. It will be eight months to-morrow. Kad And when thou hadst rescued her from death where didst thon carry her ? Zeph I carried her here."], [12, "8 Kad Here ? But tell me the words she cried out when she thought herself lost. Zeph Ah, well do I remember them. She cried : \" My mother, my mother, from heaven above protect me.\" Kad Marvellous 'tis thou, 'tis thou her life who saved, I will tell Nemea I have found thee and can tell thee she hopes thon wilt do as she wishes. Zeph Speak my lord, what does she wish ? Any desire of hers will be to me like an order from the king. What does she wish. Kad That thou shouldst promise, never to tell anyone, that it was the Princess thou didst save, also that thou promisest never to attempt to approach her, in short that thou never let anyone know that a common fisherman held her in his arms for one instant. Zeph Oh my dream, my beautiful dream. It has all passed now. Kad Dost thou consent to take this oath to me ? Zeph Say to her, my lord, that the Princess Nemea has nothing to fear from the poor fisherman Zephoris. Hear my solemn oath. I swear my lord to he silent for ever. Kad And never to approach her! Zeph (with an effort) and never to appoach her. I swear it by Brahma who hears me. Kad Very good (offers purse) I will tell her thou hast sworn and will add thou hast received thy reward. Zeph Yes my lord, I have received my reward, a thousand times more precious than this which I refuse. Kad What ? Zeph This lady so noble, and so haughty, I have held in my arms. Her proud heart has beaten against mine, and when I snatched her from the jaws of death, my lips have dared to press her forehead, tell her this, my lord, and she will under- stand that I have been well rewarded, and that I have no need of your gold. Exit Zeph. Kad He dares to brave me, so much the worse for him, but he will keep silent. He has sworn, and Nemea will yet be mine, but that man's oath is not enough, oh ! well he must be got rid of.

Kino (aside) This is a good lesson. Zeph Send some one to these fishers and give them ten pieces of gold each. King (To Sec.) Write. Zeph Now let us proceed. King Here is the report of the fourth Minister: The most virtuous young girl of every province has been married and dowried by the king. Zeph The most virtuous ? And Zelide the best girl in Nissir, has she been dowried and wish how much ? King (frowning) Does your majesty wish her to have 50 pieces of gold. Zeph I wish her to have a hundred pieces of gold, and send them at once (to Sec). King Thou shalt be obeyed. Write 100 pieces of gold. We will now pass to political affairs (Artar enteis) here is the Seigneur Artar ! (to Artar) Y\"ou have your orders. Artar Yes, but I bring grave news. King What is it ? Artar The King at the advice of Prince Kadoor sent his army yesterday to protect the people of Vizapour. But now we hear for some days ships have been cruising to the Sonth- West of the island, and we fear they are a fleet of Portuguese."], [22, "18 King Do you speak seriously ? Artar We also hear that a man from the coast has been making signals to them. Zeph It is Pifear. Artar And he has been seen going out to them in a boat and then returning after an interchange of letters. Zeph (aside) That is he. Artar What does the King command ? Zeph The King commands that the army returns to Goa in all haste. King (to Artar) He is right (to the ministers) let him make the decree (he orders them to write), Zeph Let them arrest a fisherman of Nissir named Pifear imprison him and sink his boat (aside). He will carry no more letters. King (to Sec.) Give me the decree I must sign it so that he will understand the order of his recall has been deliberated in council (Kadoor enters hears last words). Kad Call back the army ; think well before you decide ! King Why ? Kad I have particularly observed that fleet out there, as was my duty. King Well ? Kad They are merchant ships delayed by furious south-west winds, resting in sight of our harbours. King Ah ! that is fortunate, but this fisherman ? Kad ( laughing) Pure invention. A fishing boat has not gone out for many days ; and I swear it. King Marvellous Zeph That is false ; Pifear has been out three times. Kad The King can reassure himself and leave his army to accomplish their work. King That is also my advice. Council And ours. Zeph (aside) It is not mine, but I must be prudent. (aloud) Let the army continue on its route (he hides the dispatch in his bosom). Ah ! let us breathe a little (he calls a slave). King (mi the midst of his ministers) You uuderstand that his wishes are to be faithfully accomplished. Zeph (to slave) Thou knowest well that all obey my orders. Take this dispatch and carry it to the other coast to the Chief of the army. Be diligent and faithful. Your life depends upon it. F.vit Slave. King I will receive these people who have appealed to me. You hear me. Zeph The slave is gone. (Seeing Nemea enter) Nemei ? King (to Zeph) Your Majesty has no fresh commands to give ? Zeph None.

Nemea But one short day to be gaining ; Ah, King, a jest 'tis that you do. Zeph Ah ! What say you ? Alas, a jest. For many days without number I have adored you, my bosom's queen, Like the bright visions without number, Which, while we see, remain unseen. I thought not of your birth or station, When in the waves I saw you helpless lie. Had you been the lowliest in the nation, My heart had answered your despairing cry. Fair as an angel you looked to be, Like a bright vision you seemed to me. Once more, I behold you, oh ! heavenly bliss, In my fond bosom no thought but this."], [24, "20 Nemea Then when did you me first perceive ? When did you meet with me ?

Neji How you say that it was you. Zeph Ah, pray calm your wrath. Though I gave the word to be silent, Yet I can now speak without fear, For the Prince here, in your presence, Has released me from my oath. Nemea And, pray, what oath ? Zeph 'Tis an oath to be silent, Which, yesterday, Prince Kadoor From the fisherman demanded ; But, to-day, he absolved the king. Nem 0, what mystery ! I fear to seek the truth. The Prince then must have dared to lie. O, speak. Zeph Daily on the coast I sadly linger, Having no guide to find you but this ring, Which, on the sand, dropped from your finger. That to my heart does some comfort bring, And it never shall leave me in life. Nemea 'Tis my ring, dropped from my No, I cannot doubt. It is my ring, and he vows he'll keep it all his life. (Enter King and Kad.) Zeph Who goes there ? Cannot they leave me in peace ? King Pardon me, Your Majesty, but I cannot content Prince Kadoor. Zeph What does it matter ? Kad The King has betrothed me to the Princess Nemea. Zeph She ! Your betrothed ? King Has Your Majesty forgotten ? Zeph When you told me that my reason had fled I did not believe you ; but I feel if I commanded this marriage I must have been mad. Princess Nemea I will be your husband. King The princess might prefer the subject to the king. Zeph What do you say ? King Say, Nemea, whom dost thou love ? Nemea What a question, my heart shall go to the noble man who risked his life for mine. Kad (aside) He has told all. Zeph (aside) Ob, what happiness.

Zelide 'Tis I who every day, Before the sun is rising, Must by a tuneful lay, My idle brother be waking ; But 'tis in vain this morn, His deafness is surprising. Zephoris now forlorn His slumber is not breaking, But a song he fain would be hearing, And it may perhaps his heart be cheering, It is that of the nightingale I'll sing. AIR. I listen 'neath the palm tree, There I heard tho nightingale Sing this song so well and free, All of love and loyalty To his love so beautifully, Sang he far across the vale ; But his love is ever true, 'Tis in honour he doth woo. And the bird that I heard Far above, sing of love Ever new, ever true, And this song echoed long in my heart"], [28, "24 'Twas love's song that he sang. A bird then in the blue sky, Like the honest nightingale, Sang a song that was a lie All of love and loyalty, But just then I did espy Who it was who sang this tale ? And I saw that I had heard, By the heartless mocking bird, Feigning love far above. Sweet to hear, yet to jeer, So his lay passed away ; But the first, slaked love's thirst From my heart will not part, Was love's song that he sang. Zelide Good day Pifear, Pif Good day Zelide, Zelide What is the matter my friend, you look strange ? Pif I am not happy. Zelide I can see that.

Zelide Cruel monster go, for you are wrong you know, You cannot show cause for your suspicion, As you have inferred that you doubt my word, Why it is absurd and cruel admission.
