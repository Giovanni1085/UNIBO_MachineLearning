But to give a loose to Passion, under the re straint of Rhyme, is a work of some difficulty ; and if it be done here in any tolerable degree, it is the only Praise which was left me by that excellent Author in the Specta tor, who has obligd the World with Father Francis and Sifter Constance in Prose. As for the Translation from Vida, I flatter my self that it will be entertaining enough to such of my Readers as understand the Game ; and that the reft will take it upon trust in deference to the great Name of its Author, The"], [6, "The P R E F A C F, The drier his Subjecl is, the more his Genius shines in embellishing it with all the Ornaments of Poetry; in somuch that his Chess is, reckon d one of his beft Perfor mances: and, as several of the reft have been already turnd into English, this attempt of mine may be regard ed os one step more to a compleat Translation of the most celebrated Latin Poet among the Moderns. I cannot conclude without a mark of my Gratitude, and withal of my Vanity, in publishing the Honour done me upon this occasion by Mr. Pope'-s assistance. The Translation, being upon a Subjecl to which he is a Stran ger, must appear with all its faults : but I may ven ture to fay, that the most considerable blemishes in Fa ther Francis are removed by some few retrenchments and alterations which I have made upon the authority of so unquestioned a Judge and Master : And if my Sub scribers will follow the example of his Humanity and Patience 'jo far as to give me a Reading, it will be os great an instance of Regard, os, 1 believe, most Authors, besides Hhnjelf, have receivd for some time past.
