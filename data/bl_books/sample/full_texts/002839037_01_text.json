The church of Moorvinstowe stands in a secluded bottom, between two furze-clad hills, open to the Channel at the western extremity of the parish. The appearance of the coast in its viscinity is exceedingly wild and terrific: the descent through the churchyard is re markably steep ; and little appearance of cultivation is visible upon the adjoining lands; the scene collectively is sublime and interesting. This venerable church is sur rounded by the boldest works of Nature, and having braved the storms of many ages, presents to the lovers of antiquity a durable specimen of An^lo-Norman archi tecture. The southern entrance is through a porch wbich at present is nearly perfect ; the external parts of this entrance are ornamented with a band of zigzag flat and in verted, and a string of roses springing from two animals: on the pediment is a group of figures resembling crocodiles, with a chain from their mouths, entwining a lamb ; and at each corner of the pediment is a large grotesque head.

The church, which is dedicated to St. John and St. Phi lip, consists of a nave, two aisles, and a chancel. On the south side the aisle is divided from the area by five elegant clustered columns, with capitals highly orna mented, supporting pointed arches. On the north side the architecture is widely different: here arc two plain heavy pointed arches, and three circular ones, sustained by round massive columns; the round arches have a profusion of ornaments of the same description as those on the doors of the porch; human heads, the beads of birds, with the zigzag moulding, are the most pro minent portion.

The font, which stand's near the north aisle, has the appearance of great age ; it is circular and heavy ; round the middle is a band of twisted work. There are several monuments in the church : the most observable are those commemorating the Waddons of Tonacombe, in this parish. The tower of the church is embattled and orna mented with pinnacles. This fabric has undergone at different times various alterations, under the control and guidance of ignorant men, so that many parts have los all resemblance to ecclesiastical architecture, and some of its most beautiful, ornamental appendages have been removed to make way for the modern innovation of plas ter and whitewash. Several of these outcast relics are visible in the neighbourhood of the church devoted to the meanest uses ; such as fencing, landmarks, and other ser vile purposes.

In his family it continued about a century, when it reverted to the crown by forfeiture : its coustables have, ever since that period, been ap pointed by the king, and hold their situations during royal pleasure.

Within the above-mentioned towers are several hexagonal apart ments, whose walls are eight feet thick; one of these rooms is now used as a prison.

It owes its origin to king Stephen, who founded it whilst earl of Montaign and Bulloign in 1127, and endowed it with rich domains: the foundation was afterwards confirmed and secured by the charters of twelve successive monarchs, and the bulls of divers popes. The abbot of Furness was in vested with extraordinary privileges, and exercised juris diction over the whole district ; even the military were in some degree dependant upon him. A singular custom prevailed in this Abbey, distinct from every other of the same order \u2014 which was that of registering the names of such of their abbots only as, after presiding ten years, con tinued and died abbots there ; this register was called the Abbot's Mortuary : sucb of the abbots as died before the expiration of the term of ten years, or were after it translated or deposed, were not entered in this book: thus in the space of 277 years the names of only ten abbots were recorded, though, according to some authors, the real number was thirty-two or more ; but though many 6"], [178, "FURNESS ABBEY, of them for the reason above named were omitted in the register, they received in other respects the honour due to their rank. The local situation of the Abbey being formidable by nature, gave something of warlike consequence to the monks : they erected a watch-tower on the summit of a commanding hill, which commences its rise near the walls of the monastery, overlooking all Low Furness and the arm of the sea immediately beneath it : thus they were able to prevent surprise by alarming the adjacent coast with signals on the approach of an enemy. This Abbey was dedicated to St. Mary, and received its monks from the monastery of Savigny, in Normandy, who for some time conformed to the regulations of their order, wearing the habit of grey ; but embracing St. Bernard's rigid rules, they changed their habit, and became Cistercians : thus they continued till the final dissolution of the mo nastery.

Beneath this window, considerably on one side, is the principal entrance, which is worthy of remark, as there appears nothing to prevent its being placed in the middle. A still greater inconsistency is seen in the pillars that once supported the lanthorn ; three of them are composed of fine clustered shafts, the fourth is square and plain ; one of the arches clad with ivy and weeds still remains.

The famous Abbey to which this Church was annexed owed its rise to the proto-martyr of England, St. Alba mis, who, for the profession of Christianity, was be headed under the emperor Dioclesian in the year 303 : shortly after the cessation of this persecntion a church was erected by the Christians in honour of the martyr upon the spot where St. Albanus suffered, and precisely where the present Abbey Church stands. The monastery was founded by Offa, king of the Mercians, with a view to regain peace of mind, after the commission of the most flagrant outrages ; he was admonished by a vision to dedicate this Abbey to St. Albanus, and to raise and enshrine the relics of the saint; but the devastations of the Saxons rendered it impossible to discover the place of his interment ; however, this difficulty was re moved by the intervention of a miracle; for, on search ing at Verulam for the remains, a light like a large torch stood exactly over the place where they were depo sited ; and on opening the ground the body was disco vered in a wooden coffin, together with some relics, ex actly as they had been placed 344 years before.

Ealdred, the eighth abbot of St. Alban's, was the first that projected rebuilding the Abbey Church, and accordingly he began to search among the ruins of Verulnm for materials to effect his purpose. His early death prevented the execution of this design. His suc cessor added to his collection of materials, but the build ing was not commenced till after the Conquest. During the search among the ruins of the ancient city numerous pagan relics were discovered; half ruined temples, altars, and statues of heathen gods, and culinary vessels of various forms; all these were stamped to dust by order of the abbot in his zeal against paganism. Frederick, who was abbot of St. Alban's in the time of William I. gave that monarch so much trouble and uneasiness that he deposed him, and placed in his room Paul, a Norman. He first applied himself to rebuilding the Church, which was not finished till after the expiration of sixteen years. During the abbacy of Paul, the monastery received many valu able gifts; the abbot was himself a great benefactor.
