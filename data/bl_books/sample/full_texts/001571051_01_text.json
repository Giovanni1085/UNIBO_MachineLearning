Now it chanced that he picked up a fan For a dear httle Japanese party, And he turned her young head When he gallantly said, \" You're a trim little vessel, my hearty! \" So that dear little Jappy-Jap-Jappy Set her smart little cappy-cap cappy At the jolly Jack Tar From the island afar In the west of the mappy-map-mappy ! They walked in the shade of the trees In the gardens of fair Nagasaki, And her cheeks they were pink At the nautical wink, And the maritime manners of Jacky ! Though the tar couldn't speak Japanese, Yet in English he asked her to marry ; Then she crept to his side, And her fan opened wide, As she murmured, \"Mai! Kashikomari ! \" But he knew not a scrappy-scrap-scrappy Of the language of Jappy-Jap-Jappy ! Had she told him to go\u2014 With a Japanese \" No ! \" \u2014 Or with \"Yes ! \" made him happy-hap-happy ? So Jack has departed in doubt From that maiden of fair Nagasaki ; Though he wept and he sighed At the loss of a bride Till the captain and crew thought him cracky. And he vows, as he cruises about. (Though by lessons and books as a rule bored) That all seamen A.B.s Should be taught Japanese By a rather too liberal School Board !
