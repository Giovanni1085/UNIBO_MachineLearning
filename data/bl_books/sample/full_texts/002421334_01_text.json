The Situation of Bristol, and its Advantages. t$rt$tOl has been represented, by inattentive or malicious writers, as situated in a dark bottom. De Foe, in his former editions of The Tour through Brit ain, and Savage, the poet, have asserted, that the situation is inconvenient and disagreeably low. Whereas, on the contrary, the heart of the city is really situated on a hill of considerable and sufficient height, and appears to be low only from the lofty and beautiful hills with which it is almost surrounded. Were the country about it low and level, it would appear to be on noble elevations. In the last edition of the Tour, published in 1778, the situation is great ly and justly extolled : Bristol is built on hills in a vale, and its eminences would be too high were they higher from the river. The City Bristow or Bristol, lies in 51, 30 deg. of N. lat. , 2, 46 of W. long, at the southern extremity of Glocestershire, and the northern of Somersetshire ; being taken out of, and made a City and County, in dependent of both, by Edward III. though it is gene rally reckoned in Somerset. It is 115 miles due west B"], [22, "\u20222 from London ; through Bath and Chippenham 11/; throu-h Devizes 1-20 ; 12 W. N. VV of Bath ; 17!) N. E. of Falmouth ; 80 N, E. of Exeter, 149 E. of Milford Haven ; 34 S. W. by S. of Glocester ; GO S. S. W. of Worcester ; 154 S. by E. of Chester ; 188 S. of Liver pool ; 2*28 S. W. of York ; 220 W. by S. of Norwich; and 68 W. by S. of Oxford. It has two Rivers, the Avon and the Froom ; its principal is the Avon ; the course of which is changed since the completion of the Floating harbour, taking a direction a little above Rownham Ferry, Hotvvells, through the meads on the Redcliff side, and meeting its original course a little below Totterdown. The Floating harbour com mences near Rownham ferry, where is a large basin, called Cumberland Basin, through which the larger vessels pass ; the float continuing by Canon's marsh to the Quay, where the river Froom meets it, from thence round the Grove, the Back, and passing St, Mary-le-Port, by the borders of St. Philip and Jacob's parishes, reaching near its original direction below Totterdown, making a distance of above two miles. The vessels are constantly afloat, and not liable to damage from the revolutions ofthe tides; \u2014 these im provements were began in 1804. and completed in about six years afterwards : how far these alterations have improved the city, we will leave for those who are better acquainted with the subject to determine. The City is built about eight miles from the mouth ofthe Avon, or discharge into the Bristol channel, or Severn sea. It stands in a most delightful and healthy country, and is surrounded with numerous verdant hills, some of moderate, and others of towering heights, particularly to the north and east which de fend it from the cold winds, and render its situation warm and comfortable. The loftiest hill is Dunderry, to the south and south-east, from which there are grand and very distant prospects. The country is far more beautiful about Bristol, and it has more varied views than about London. The circumjacent regions are varigated with high and wholesome downs, sweetened with odoriferous plants and herbs;"], [23, "3 fruitful vallies watered with rivers, springs, brooks, and rivulets ; sublime rocks ; thick and solemn woods ; beautiful scenes of nature ; and most pleas- ing prospects of land and water, with a considerable extent of country. In its vicinity are many pleasant and handsome villages, and seats of nobility and gentry happily situated. These circumstances gene- rally attract the attention and excite the admiration of travellers and foreigners. By Bristol, we would be understood to mean the City, and all its inhabited environs that pertain to, and are connected with it : and a general description of the situation of modern Bristol, thus taken, is, that it stands in a vale, on eminences, level grounds, and on steep and lofty hills to the N. N. W. and W. of it; the heights of some of which are too sudden and inconvenient for carriages. The summits of these hills, Kingsdown, St. Michael's, and Brandon hill, are about 250 feet in perpendicular height above the rivers ; and consequently the lower buildings of Bristol appear from their tops to be in a deep valley, and the spectator is above the highest steeple in the city ; yet several of the lower parts stand on fine ele- vations from the rivers, the ascents to which were formerly too steep, but by late improvements are rendered easy, and not inconvenient for trade and heavy carriages. The old town or city (Caer Brito) primarily built, and which was within the inner wall, stands on a hill of forty feet of perpendicular height, between the rivers Avon and Froom ; from which eminence there is every way a decent. Thus the heart of the city being seated on a hill, and the streets intersecting each other at right angles in several places, it has a free admission and circulation of air. The City is said to resemble ancient Rome; its plan being nearly circular, with a greater diameter one way than another ; and the river cutting off about a sixth part from the rest. Also it stands on seven hills ; and its principal river, the Avon, is yellow and rapid like the Tyber, though inferior in breadth."], [24, "4 Its hills are, 1st. That on which stood the old city, which is now in the centre, the walls of which were nearly circular, and had five or six gates. II. That on which stood the Castle to the east, which ig bounded by the Avon on the south; the Froom on the north ; and by a deep ditch or moat (now partly an hed over) on the east. III. To the west, the Col lege-green, a considerable and pleasing eminence, and on which stands the Cathedral Church, &c. IV. To the south of the Avon, about three furlongs from Bristol bridge, is Redcliff hill, on which are, the fa mous church of that name, its church-yard, and seve ral other streets and places. V. St. Michael's hill, of great height, and covered with a variety of houses and streets up to the summit. VI. Kingsdown, part of which i* iii the city; on which are several modern streets and pleasant gardens ; the boundary or chasm between this and St. Michael's being in upper Maud lin street and Bedford place, opposite. VII. Bran don hill, which is in the City ; the chasm between this and St. Michael's, is Park street This hill, though its base is almost surrounded with buildings, is not yet built over, though on it are erected Berkeley square, Great george street, Charlotte street, Queen's parade, &c. These three last grand eminences exhibit countless beauties, and are nearly covered with houses and gardens, rising street over street to their very tops, which command various delightful and extensive views of the city, and of the country for several miles around. Strangers, who are spectators from the op posite hills, aud from some parts of the city, and suburbs, are struck with agreeable surprise at the sight of a large town, hanging in continued slope, as it were from the very clouds. From these hills, and more particularly Pile hill, on the south of the Bath road, the city, its cathedral and churches, the towers of some of which are lofty and elegant, make an august and venerable appearance. The vallies and hills of Pristol are covered with public and private buildings of various materials and constructions. Us upper parts stand principally on"], [25, "5 rocks ; and its lower, some on red marie, and others on thick hard beds of sand or coals. The ground under the surface is perforated with drains and com mon sewers in all directions. There are very few, if any, houses that have not a communication with the main sewers ; a provision for cleanliness not so universal in any city in the world. Filth and noxious \u25a0 effluvia are thus received into the old river or floating harbour, which being regularly cleansed, and every care taken by the Dock-company to prevent all un wholesome exhalation; though in strict justice it must be acknowledged, that in opposition to all their truly laudable exertions, in the summer season particu larly, the water acquires a dark unpleasant surface ; and where it is most subject to the reception of drains, emits a rather offensive smell. Bristol is, by nature and situation, a very healthy town; many agreeable circumstances render it so. A few fathoms under ground is excellent water. Its air is well known and experienced to be undeniably and notably salubrious. Its soil is dry, and the damps of some moist countries aud atmospheres are here unknown. It has very little marshy ground a bout it : London has many pernicious marshes too nigh to it. Some invalids of Bristol, whom business or curiosity have led to the metropolis, have found themselves worse than before, and have been obliged to make a hasty retreat to regain their native air. The advantageous circumstances of the situation of Bristol, taken altogether, may not be readily paral leled. Several ships of war, of from 40 to 70 guns, were built here for Government, during the first con test with America. The Avon and Froom, as before observed, being formed into large docks of water, facilitate trade, as vessels can now proceed on their voyages when the tides are at the neap, which other wise necessarily occasioned a delay : and by the same means ships of great burthen instead of remain ing in Kingroad until the tides rise high enough to admit them, are received in an immense basin called, Cumberland Basin, near to the Hotwells ; and here"], [26, "6 they lie safely, and unload with ease. Its conveni ence for trade is every way apparent. Its own river is navigable to the spacious, populous, and elegant city of Bath. It stands so near the confluence of the river Avon with the Severn, that it enjoys the navigation and trade of that great river and adjacent counties; and of vast extent of sea coasts down the Bristol Channel, in Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, to the Land's End ; and of Southern Wales to Mil ford Haven. Ireland is just at the mouth of its channel, whose neighbourhood and trade are un doubtedly very beneficial to it. It enjoys the benefit of three Mineral Springs, two warm and one Chaly beate ; and of great resort and residence of nobility and gentry, especially in the months of summer. Neither London, Dublin, nor Edingburgh have any coal in their vicinities : Bristol stands in the midst of a coal country, the veins of which run under its streets. It is surrounded by colleries, not only in Kingswood on the Glocester side of the river, but also on the Somerset side. It has in its environs quarries of various sorts of stone for lime, building, and paving. The quarries of Dundry, Bishport, Brislington, Durdham Down, St. Vincent's Rocks, Horfield, Stapleton, Downend, &c. would furnish stone enough to build and pave a city larger than Babylon, which Heredotus declares was so very ex tensive, that on its being taken by the Persians, the event was unknown to many of its inhabitants for the space of several days. Fuel, and the materials for building, are less expensive here than at most other populous towns. Not to enlarge on the great plenty of the neces saries of life, in the counties of Glocester, Somerset, and Wilts, which supply the inhabitants of Bristol: its vicinity to Wales, and the fruitful counties of Gla morgan and Carmarthen, occasion a great and conti nual importation of corn, cattle, pigs, poultry, salt butter, eggs, and fruit ; besides what it receives from the other English counties. With all these advan tages, Bristol has gradually risen to the rank of the"], [27, "second city in England, for extent, population, trade opulence, increase, and importence to government and the whole nation. The late Mr. Godwin speak ing of Bristol says, \u2014 r Where Nature's hand, and arts improvement join, To make the place in useful greatness shine : AVhose oozy banks with two great streams inlaid, } And naval strength alternatively convey'd, (. Command the staple of the western trade.' j Bristol was one of the most ancient cities in England before it was divided into counties. After that division, which became large and eminent in two counties, it was taken out of both and made inde pendent of either. Thus singularly situated, bem neither a county town, in any county, nor subject to any, but between two, and constituted independent in its state and gov ernment, it was termed in its anci AND ROYAL CITY?*\"* * * FREE"], [28, "CHAP. II. Antiquity, Names, and earliest Accounts of Bristol, to William the Conqueror. WHEN Julius C\u00e6sar invaded Britain he found it widely inhabited ; and it is not improbable that it might have existed so for many previous ages; hutas the original and primitive state, popularity and his tory of nations are enveloped in the darkness and obscurity of years, it would be fruitless to form con jectures upon that which seems only to be known to the great omniscient Creator. It is evident, however, that the inhabitants must have occupied particular places ; and not less evident that they chose the most convenient. And there is no doubt but that many of our best situated towns and cities were ori ginally begun by the native Britons ; especially those places situated on the banks of rivers, from the easy intercourse which they afforded between distant spots, with many other advantages that are likely to promote health and comfort. There is great reason to conclude that very long before the invasion of the Romans, such an advantageous, eligible situation as that on which the ancient city was built, had not escaped the notice of the Britons, and that it had been an elected and esteemed place of habitation. Standing on a pleasing, moderate eminence between two rivers ; watered by the confluence of the rivers on three sides; being so convenient for defence and security, having such an easy communication with the ocean by its channel, and the inland parts of England by the Avon and Severn, there is no doubt but that our British ancestors had been invited to fix their seat here in the earliest times under the name"], [29, "9 of Caer Brito, i. e. the British city, however rudely or rurally it might have been constructed. For we learn from the attentive and accurate C\u00e6sar, that their buildings were numerous, and poor rude cottages constructed of mud or hurdles, that their towns were sometimes fenced with trees ; and gave the names of town or city to certain thick woods which they inhabited and fortified with rampiers and ditches, and to which they made their retreat and resort when invaded by their enemies. Such we may suppose was Caer Brito in its original state, forti fied with trees, rivers, and perhaps walls of mud ; existing many years before the given time of Beiinus and Brennus, the sons of Molmutius Dunwallo, who (according to Geoffry of Monmouth) lived 380 years before the commencement of the Christian era. Dunwallo son of Cludo, duke cf Cornwall, was the first reputed king of the Britons, and was crowned in the year 3522. He was well beloved by his sub jects, and established good laws, which were trans- lated from the British into the Latin language. He built the Temple of Peace in New Troy, now Leu don : he measured the length and breadth of the British Island ; and built the city by the river Usk, and called it Care Lleon ar Wysk, now Caerleon on the Usk, which was then the chief city and metropo lis of Great Britain, and was also called second Rome from its being so noble a city. He was the first king of the Britons who wore a crown of gold ; and the first who made weights to buy and sell by : in this island he reigned 40 years, and was buried at New Troy (London). \u2014 See Fabians History. Brennus and Beiinus jointly reigned for some time, Brennus possessing the northern, and Beiinus the southern parts, and Wales ; but Brennus being desir ous to rule the whole, prepared for war against his brother ; but their mother finding them determined, she interfered, and presenting her bosom open, de sired them to plunge their spears there, or make peace upon the ground, which so affected them, that they immediately complied, and divided the kingdom C"], [30, "10 between them again: Beiinus ruled his subjects mild and religious, according to the Druidical system ; he made Denmark pay him tribute ; he made a gate in London, called Billing's-gate; and built the Tower of London. At last Brennus gave up his right to his brother, and went over to France to king Sigvus, who honored him to the utmost for his natural parts and valour in war. He gave him his daughter to wife, and made him his chief councellor. He accom panied the king to Rome, and there died. Beiinus reigned twenty-six years at the time of his death, when his corpse was burned, put in an urn, embalm ed, and placed upon the pinacle of Billing's-gate. Beiinus is said to have made several roads and high ways in Britain, the easier to maintain a communica tion in the country. A work professing to be ancient, speaking of the foundation of Bristol, ascribes it to Beiinus, \"the rodes, or grete waies, formyd bie kinge Belyne, the Breton, doe hereabouts apere.\" , It does not appear that the Britons had any build ings of stone or bricks ; and we are informed that the Romans first taught them to build walls of stone. As Caer Brito was walled round, and a place of account in the fifth century, when the Romans left Britain, it incontrovertibly follows, that the Romans taught and assisted them to fortify with a wall of stone, and plan their city, between the rivers. The Romans gene rally laid out their incipient towns in four streets, directing to the four cardinal points, which was and is the plan of the internal and most ancient parts of Bristol ; also Chester and other places of Roman foundation. That the city existed antecedently to the invasion of the Romans is evident from the name by which it was called, Caer Brito, the British City, to distinguish it from their castle and camps on Clif ton, Leigh, and Durdham Downs, which were called Abone from the name of the river. The Emperor Claudius Drusus made an expedition into Britain, where for his clemency the Britons erect ed a temple and altar to his name and fame. From his regard to the country he named his son Brittani-"], [31, "11 cus. His general here was Ostorius Scapula. And that Ostorius was the cause of a Roman fortilication, castrum or castle at Clifton, we shall produce the following proofs : \u2014 Tacitus, the Roman historian says, \" that Ostorius about the year of Christ 50, extended his victorious arms upon the banks of the Severn, and secured that river and the Avon. \" And in another place, \" The General Ostorius took away the arms of those who were suspected, and restrained those on the rivers Avon and Severn, surrounding them with camps.\" The word twice translated Avon ,is in the Latin, Antona ; and it is generally agreed among modern historians and antiquarians, that it signifies the Avon of Bristol. These camps we are told \"were to restrain the Cangi. After \" he had fallen on them and ravaged almost as far as the Irish Sea, he placed governors over the Severn and Antona, which was a river emptying itself into the Severn.\" The Cangi were a clan or race of bold Britons who inhabited Somersetshire, and whose capital seat was Keynsham. That their volour gave Ostorius some trouble we may learn from the following passage from Tacitus, or some other credible historian (1 cannot now recollect whom) \"The Cangi performed great exploits against Ostorius.\" Camden was of opinion that Antona was put for the Warwickshire Avon, but it was certain it was not, by Ostorius's pursuit of them almost as far as the Irish Sea, which plainly points out to us the coasts of Somerset, Devon, and perhaps part of Cornwall. So that the Cangi, and his persuit of them, were not to the north, but the south of the river Avon. And therefore the Cangi could not be affected by camps in Warwickshire, or Glocestershire. Besides the frequent occurrence of the syHables Cain, Caun or Cang in Somersetshire, sufficiently prove it to have been their place of residence. There are Cainsham, Wincanton, Caundle, Cannington, Canningham, Can ningford, Quantock, &c. Whereas there is not any town or parish in Glocestershire that hath any simi lar nomination. Coins of the Roman emperors have been found at Quantock, Conquest, Brent Knoll, &c."], [32, "12 Having proved that Somersetshire was the seat of the Cansri, it follows that Antona of Tacitus was the Avon us Caer Brito ; and also that Ostorius built the camp, castle, or fortification at Clifton, &c. All the Roman encampments, forts, or stations were set on hills, that the soldiers may be able to discry the ap proach of the enemy ; anil as the Romans were in an enemy's country, that they might be ever on the watch, and keep a good look out. What could be a fitter situation for the fortress than such a hill as Clifton, which is three hundred feet in perpendicular heigth from the river ; is the loftiest eminence about Bristol that is so near it ; and commands a view of the country all around, Glocestershire and Mon mouthshire, and fine views of the gentle Severn, pouring its silver waves, amid lofty hills, which seem to intercept the progress of the very clouds. In the Itinerary of Antoninus, a station or camp of the Romans was noticed by the name of Abone or Avone, (the British name of the river) situated be tween Aquae Solis, the waters of the sun, i. e. Bath, and the river Severn, which could be no other than the camp or castle at Clifton. For when you are on Clifton Hill, turn your eyes to the east, and you see Bath and beyond it ; \u2014 to the west, and you see the Severn ; so that this fortress was in a strait line from Bath to the mouth of the Severn ; and was incontes tably the Abone of Antoninus. But this hill of Clifton was not spacious enough to contain the whole Roman army, who were encamped around, on Durdham Down, about Westbury, Kings weston, and Henbury. All of these settlements here about had one name Abone, from the river. It is further remarkable, that under KingswestonhiH, near to the river, was a common field called Avon's Town, as mentioned in the rental of Sir Ralph Sadlier, dated 36, Henry V1I1. \" One acre in Campo Abone Town.\" Here have been found coins of Nero, Ves pasian, Constantine, &c. In a manuscript of Abel TVanter, in the Bodleian library it is written, \"At Pollbury, where Trim goeth"], [33, "13 into the Avon, much coin hath been found, conjec tured to be the ancient station of the Romans be tween Bath and Avington (or Avon's town) mentioned by Antoninus the emperor, iu his journal book \" Ihese and the great number of Roman coins that have been found at Henburv, of which there is a lon\u00b0 and particular list in Barrett's History of Bristof were incontrovertible proofs that the Romans were here, and had a camp and station by the Avon, the work of Ostorius, the Roman Propr\u00e6tor under Clau dius. And it is probable that many of them might be inganson on the hills in the Summer; and that m the severe weather of Winter the greater part might be encamped under the hills for a considerable extent of countiy. William of Worcester, parish priest of St. James's, Bristol, who wrote in 1480, and mentioned the forti fied camp on Clifton hill, adds (as translated from the Latin) \" And that such a fortress was in all likelihood there in ancient times, there remains to this day, in a great circle, a heap of stones great and small, scat tered and spread abroad. It is very wonderful to behold these stones globularly lying in such order, and in a great circle : for there seems to have been a very strong castrum (or, castle) which is said to have been for some hundred years past, and is now levelled with the ground. And it is therefore an honour and ornament to my native country, Bristol, to have or hear of the foundation of such noble for tresses and camps. 1 write this for the sake of com memorating this camp or fortress.\" The remains of this camp were certainly more evident three hundred years ago than they are at present, but the aggera and ditches are still to be seen, and she limits to be traced and ascertained. Many coins of Nero, Domi tian, Trajan, and other emperors have been dug up there. Also, when Sir William Draper levelled the ground near to the camp, a curious Roman urn with two handles, tiles, bricks, and broken potshords were found there. In 1783, Roman coins were found in Jigging the foundation of the new houses near to"], [34, "14 those remains of the camp, which are still left for the speculation of the curious. Coins have been found in making Seamill dock, and in ploughing the adjacent fields. Art and nature joined to render the castle on Clifton a most impregnable fortress, as it was secur ed on one side by a terrible precipiece and the river; and on the other by fences and ditches. Leland, and several other authors inform us, that Bristol was called Caer Oder, or Oter, Nante Badon: i. e. the city Oder in the valley of Bath. But he adds, \" As Nante signifies a place in which a river flows, 1 should therefore read it, Nante Avon, from that river; which may be conjectured from a place in Antoninus Itinerary, called Abone or Avone, the name cfa city.\" Baxter, in his Glossary, writes thus, \" The city Caer Brito, was, by the Britons, called Caer Oder, i. e. Civitas Limitis, a frontier city ; which agrees with its situation as a frontier town of defence for the Britons before they were driven into Wales.\" We may infer, from what Baxter h?s laid down, that Caer Brito was the original name of the city. And it ap pears that subsequently it was called Caer Oder, out of compliment to Ostorius, whs commanded here, and was finally victorious. As he caused fortifica tions to be raised in many places along the Avon, above and below Bristol, the Britons gave the name of Caer Qdera, i. e. Castrum Ostorii, to that city. This appears to be the most probable conjecture, that from him they named their town Caer Ostera, and by dropping tbe letter s, which was quite common among them, Caer Oter, or Otera. And to strengthen this opinion, we may add that Aust Passage was, in Doomsday book, made by order of William the Con queror, at about 1008, called Austor Clive, retaining the name of Ostorius, without the Latin termination. The origin of the name Bristow, is Caer Brito, tbe British town or city ; thus nominated to distinguish it from the Roman station Abone, on the hills ; and on account of its being inhabited by the Britons, un der the protection and government of the Romans."], [35, "15 The first name of the city still prevailed, and Caer Oter was in a series of years discontinued. That the Romans governed or watched over Caer Brito, and that their military people occupied those hills, now within the city, known by the names of the Fort and King.sdown, may be inferred from coins of Constantine, Constantius, Gordian, and Tetricus be ing found at the Fort by the late Thomas Tyndall, esq. ; and from a com of Constantine being found four feet deep, in a field behind the Montague tavern, on Kingsdown, in 1780. So that it is probable they had a fort or station on the hill, which commanded a view of the city, and a great extent of country to and be yond Aquae Solis, i. e. Bath. Tbere is no particular hnformation extant of the improvements that the Romans taught or assisted the Britons to make in their city, Brito; but that it flourished and improved we learn from the following testimonies ; Anderson, in his History of Commerce\" printed in the year 1704, vol. I. pages 18 and 80, in forms us, that \" Brito wns reckoned by Gildas among the fortified and eminent cities of Britain, so early as the year 430.\" Gildas was an ancient British histo rian, who died in the year 570, and he mentions twenty-eight cities famous in ancient times, and Caer Brito as one of them. This was after the Romans had left the island, and therefore it must have been a place of considerable acconnt in the fifth century. Nennius, about the year 620, expressly mentions Caer Brito as one of the twenty-eight cities ; and Bede, who died in 734, says, \" Britain was famous in mcient times, for twenty-eight most noble cities, urnished with gates and strong bolts, walls, and owers,\" sufficient for defence, before the invention )f powder and cannon. So that, from the evidence produced, a doubt cannot remain, that Caer Brito lad heen inhabited by the Britons before the invasion )f C\u00e6sar; and was afterwards walled and fortified >y the Romans. Theodocius was the last Roman emperor that had >ower in Britain. For, about 423, the Goths made"], [36, "dreadful devastations in the empire ; and forced the Romans to leave their conquests, after they had com manded here for almost 500 years, when they took their last farewell. But they had levied so many soldiers for foreign countries that the land was very much depopulated ; so that the Britons were obliged to call in the Saxons against their enemies, the Picts; and having overcome them, the Saxons made a com plete conquest of the whole country. Leland, (that sedulous and judicious antiquarian, who wrote in the reign of Henry the VIII,) says, concerning this city, \" Aucta est a Saxonibus.\" It was increased by the Saxons. Its name also has some little change made in it, by the addition of the Saxon termination, stow or place, and was called for many years, Brystowe, for that Bristowre till nearly to the close of the last century ; and from the latinized nominations, Bristolia, or Bristolium, modernly BRISTOL.\u2014 Note, The Saxons landed here, A. D. 450. About tbe year 596, Pope Gregory the Great sent Agustine, a Monk, with forty other missionaries, to convert the Britons. These landed at the Isle of Thanet ; one of whom, Saint Jordan, was sent to Bristol, to preach the gospel there, where he died and was buried, This serves to prove, that Bristol was noticed in the sixth century as a populous and important place. Leland has left on record thus : \u2014 \" At St. Augus tine's black Channons, extra M\u0153nia, ibiquein magna area, estSacellum in quo sepultus esl,Sanctus Jordanus unus ex Discipulis, Augustini Anglorum Apostoli.\" Thus. translated \u2014 At the Monastery of Saint Augustine, and there in a large area, in a chapel, in which was buried Saint Jordan, one of the deciples of Augustine, the apostle of the English nation. The church of this Monastery is the present Cathedral ; and the large area is College green, which was a place of burial for the Monastery. Camden also in his Britannia, mentions Saint Jordan, and calls him the companion of Augus tine, the apostle of the English, and narrates that he was interred here, but differs from Leland in the situation of his tomb. Saint Augustine converted"], [37, "17 Ethelbert, the first king of Kent, (who died A. D. 516) to the Christian Faith; and was the first arch lishop of Canterbury. The Monastery afterwards :rected here was dedicated to St. Augustine, in commemoration of his sending Jordan as a Mission ary to Bristol. After the coming of the Saxons, this city was nuch enlarged, had an external and second wall built ibout some parts of it, where it had been increased, ind became the principal seaport, mart, fortress and capital of the West-Saxon kingdom. Hollingshead says, that King Alfred, in the fifth year of his reign, drove the Danes from Exeter to Dartmouth, where they took shipping, and that he dispersed others, \"some of whom fled to Chippen ham, and some to Bristowe.\" A. D 876. According to Stow, in the year 915, a great navy of Danes sailed about the west country, landed in divers places, taking great prey, and went to their ships again. King Edward the elder, son of Alfred, for defence of the city and country, built a castle at the mouth of the Avon. Leland informs us that about the year 900, Ayl ward, (surnamed Sneaw, or Snow, from his fair com plexion) a valliant Saxon nobleman, of great rank and fortune, and related to King Edward, senior, \"was Lord of Brightstowe, and founder of the Mo nastery of Cranbourne,\" and also of some consider able and principal buildings of Bristol, of which more hereafter. His son Algar succeeded him to the lordship of Bristol, by hereditary right; and after them, Brictric or Brightrick. He was a very weal thy man, resided much at Bristol, greatly distin guished, repaired and improved it, and was its last lord, or governor, before the conquest. In the year 1051, in the reign of Edward the Con fessor, (as we learn from Simon of Durham) Harold and Leofwine, the sons of earl Godwin, were pro scribed : on which they fled to Brystowe, and went on board a ship that their brother Swayne had pre pared for them, and were carried into Ireland. D"], [38, "18 In 1003, (according to Florence of Worcester,) Harold, duke of Kent and Sussex, and afterwards king, embarked with his forces on board a fleet at Brystowe, and set sail from thence to invade Wales, to take revenge on Griffyth, king of Wales, between whom and Harold there was a great enmity. In Doomsday Book, finished in the year 1086, by direction of William the Conqueror, and which is still in existence among the records in the tower, the people of Bristol were stiled Burgesses ; a sufficient proof of the importance of the place at that period. The entry concerning Bristol is thus translated from the Latin ; \" Bristou, with Barton, an adjoining farm, paid to the king 110 marks of silver; (\u00a373 6s. 8d.j and the Burgesses returned, that bishop G. had 33 marks and one of gold (\u00a328).\" It was then rated higher than any city or town in England, except London, York and Winchester. Robert, the rhyming monk, of Glocester, reckons Bristoe among the chief towns of this land. The furste Lords and Maisters that yn yis tonde were, And the chisse Tonnes furste they lete arer, London and Evervvyk, Lincolne and Leycestre, Coehestre and Canterbyre, Bristoe and Worcestre, Note.\u2014 Evervvyk is put for York, which was the Eboracum of the Romans. And Bristoe is placed before Worcester, which is very ancient, and was built by and was the Bravonium of the Romans. The Bishop G. mentioned above, was Godfrey, Bi shop of Constance, who was at that time Custos, keeper or proprietor of the castle. Thus the most difficult part of the History of Bris tol is treated of, and its antiquities deduced from the best, and most valid authorities that are extant."], [39, "CHAP. III. Castle of Bristol. IN the early times of the History of Britain, when different Conquerors had possessed themselves of the land, a spirit of jealousy of a neighbouring Chief's extent of power, might dictate the idea of preserva tion to an equally aspiring mind ; strong holds would in consequence be formed ; and instead of that cor dial union subsisting, which is the very soul and ex istence of a State, each that could, would recede into a stern and sullen independency. Whether this was the occasion of the first erection of a castle at Bristol, cannot rightly be ascertained : its original founder is unknown ; but that it might pri marily be the reason, does not seem impossible. Camden, although of a disposition industrious, clearly and rightfully endeavouring to exhibit the true condition, nature and sense of the antiquities he surveyed, was evidently eronious in asserting, that Robert Rufus, earl of Glocester (natural son of Henry the 1st), was the founder ; for in the year 1088, it was mentioned by Roger Ovedon as \"Castrum fortissi mum,\" a very strong castle. And if it were so very strong only 22 years after the conquest, there cannot he a question concerning its previous existence for a long time. Another proof of Camden's mistake is, that it was held by Godfrey, bishop of Constance, and Robert de Mowbray, earl of Northumberland, in a rebellion against King William Rufus, in 1088, before Henry the 1st, father of earl Robert, was arrived at man's estate. Barrett, in his history of Bristol, seems to think that King Edward was the founder of its castle"], [40, "20 (which does not exactly follow from Slow, as men tioned in the latter part of the second chapter) and for evidence, has recourse to the compositions produced by Thomas Chatterton. In making this reference, the weighty historian discovers a pitiful disposition to rest his arguments apon assertions which he formerly appeared to consider suspicious; and unworthy to extort them by threats and promises from the hands of Chatterton, neglecting to reward the instrument of his information. If they were genuine, the poor youth certainly deserved encou ragement for his communication, which it is well known was never sufficiently afforded him ; hut if spurious, it is strange the pompous antiquarian should cite them ! But be this as it may, the matter contain ed in the old prose works produced as Rowley's and Turgot's, is very interesting, and certainly must have had some other origin than mere imagination. Rowley's MS. says \"The outer walle of the castle stooden ynne the daies of Williamme Conquerere; the square castle wythynne was ybyldehne by Robyrte Connesul of Gloucestre, as bee the crosse ynne the area, and the small stronge holde whyche was thenne a watche towre, ecke the two watche towrettes wyth ynne the walle of the ould castle.

Leland informs us, that Robert built part of it ; and that the great dungeon tower was made of stone brought out of Normandie, by the redde earl of"], [41, "21 Its antiquity we may rely was very great. It must have had many governors, constables, and wardens, in the early times ; but as they cannot all rightly be ascertained, we shall content ourselves with mention ing Ella, who was lord of the Castle about the year 920. He is said to have died in the Castle, of wounds received in battle with the Danes. The following Poem (whether genuine or not) made to the memory of this hero, we should suppose will not be displeasing to our readers ; it is ascribed to the pen of 'T. Rowlie.' gonqc toe <Bl\\a.

King William Rufus, for service done to him by Robert Fitzhaymon, gentleman of his bedchamber, gave him the earldom of Glocester, with the Castle of Bristol appendant to it : he had no son, but four daughters ; Mable, the eldist, was a great heiress, and a lofty dame. This lady, king Henry I. married to his son Robert, who in 1110 was Lord of Bristol by marriage and creation ; Fitzhaymon dying in 1 107. Robert, monk of Glocester, gives a curious account of king Henry's courting the lady for his son, who refused him, as first, for want of a title. Sir, sheo said, ich wote your herte upon mee is, More for myne heritage, than for myselfe I wis : And such heritage as ich have, hit weer to me great shame, To take a Lord, but he hadde any surname ; Damoseill, quoth the Kyng, thou seest well in this case Sir Robert Filz Ilayme thi Fader's name was: As fayre a name he shall have, as you may see ; Sir Robert le Filz Roy shall his name be: Damoseill, he say'd, thi Lord shall have a name, For him and for his heires fayre without blame; For Robert Erie of Glocester, his name shall be and is, \"1 Ilee shall be Erie of Glocester, and his heires I wis > Inne this forme, quoth shee, ich wole, that all mie thyng be his.) In the battle of Lincoln, king Stephen was taken prisoner by carl Robert, Avho sent him to the empress Maud, then a Glocester, from whence she ordered the king to Bristol castle, where he was at first treat ed gently, but afterwards laid irons, on pretence of haivng been seen beyond the bounds of his confine ment. The earl himself was also taken prisoner near Winchester, and was esteemed an equal ransom for"], [43, "23 the king, who was released, after nine months impri sonment, 1 141. The king, for his greater dignity was released first, and the queen, with one of her sons, and two lords, was kept in the castle as hostages, from the time of the king's being released, till the earl was also returned to his friends at Bristol, when he set the queen and hostages free. It was not until 1130, that earl Robert began to rebuild, improve, and strengthen this ancient castle, celebrated by Roger of Hovedon, forty-two years before. A very strong castle could not be the wrork of a day ; it was certainly of very ancient foundation. Aylward Sneaw, who was lord of Bristol about the year 900, and said to be ' vir in armus strennus', a man of great prowess ; or Brictric his grandson, were both very partial to Bristol, and great builders and repairers of it, might have commenced or improved so considerable a work. Anincontestible proof, that Brictric carried on capital operations at Bristol may be found in some Latin verses, taken from a Chronicle of Tewkesbury, quoted by Dugdale, in Monasticon, vol. I. page 161. Thus translated : I Brictric, ere the conquest, ihe last Lord, This Temple founded ; With heart's free accord, I built up Bristow, for this very cause. To honour him who dy'd upon the Cross. The Temple refers to the great old church as Tewkesbury, one of the largest in England that is not a cathedral ; and the last line, either to the general worship of Christ, or to some particular religious foundation erected by Brictric ; or to the four most ancient streets of Bristol, which are built in the form of a cross. We have seen a manuscript, containing many very interesting accounts respecting the city of Bristol, and from it take leave to present our readers with a poetical effusion, which has this Brictric for its subject. This piece, from its actique habiliments, appears to wish to be considered the voice of other days; but leaving to the critic to decide, its animated strain."], [44, "24 and application to the matter immediately under our notice, will sufficiently warrant its insertion. \" \u00a3ongr*\" *' Once Vyncente Egwoioltonne, barde divyne, As twylight grey 'gan peril), high astoode ; Ilk grofdtn faye lyih'd to his harpys clyne ; As swete the minstrelle sunge by Avone's flood.

Then were the two communications made be tween the Avon and Froom, to the east and west; that to the east is still remaining, though partly arch ed over, and that to the west, now destroyed, was a very deep trench from the water below where New gate stood, to the Avon ; over the middle of this, near to St. Peter's church, was a draw-bridge, leading from the castle gate to the town. The circumference of the water around it was at least half a mile, accord ing to William of Worcester, 1225 yards. It had very strong walls, with battlements, and a sally-port leading into the scite of the present Queen street. Concerning the great tower, we shall quote the following passage from William of Worcester. \" The Tour, called the Dongeon, ys in length, este and west, 60 feet, and north and south, 45 feet ; with fowr tours standing upon the fowr corners ; the mightyest tour above all the fowr tours ys 5 fethem hygh abofe all the fowr tours ; and the wallys be in thykness there 6 fote.\" The Castle itself, excluding the outworks, was 540 feet from east to west, and 300 from north to south. There were, in the two great courts of the castle, many towers, a church, and a magnificent chapel for the king ; a palace, a royal hall, thirty-six yards long and eighteen broad ; a prince's chamber, seventeen yards by nine. The principal buildings stood on an area of three acres and three quarters of ground, ex clusive of houses, barracks, gardens, courts, yards, and other accommodations for the officers and garison. Leland informs us, that the great tower stood in tbe north-west part of the castle, and that in his time, about the 26th of Henry the VI II. the whole was de caying and teadingto ruin. The only apparent remains is near Castle street : here are two Saxon arches, with ribbed roofs of stone, which have the appearance of a portch to a church, or magnificient hall, but now support the houses, of 20 and 21 Castle green. E"], [46, "26 In the reign of king Stephen, the robbers and free booters of the castle, both horse and foot, committed great depredations on the city and country : for the castle was exempt from the jurisdiction of the city, and under its own governors, who might sometimes be absent, or connive at the insults of the military. In the reign of king John, the Castle was annexed to the crown, and from thenceforth, the kings of Eng land reserved it to their own use, choosing the con stable and other officers, and appointing them salaries and perquisites. In this king's reign, Eleanor of Bre tagne, the lawful heiress of the English crown, was imprisoned nearly forty years in the castle. This circumstance has given rise to a very beautiful elegy by the rural Shenstone. The reader will find some notes concerning the Castle in the historical part. And to these we shall add, that at the reformation, 1549, the inhabitants of the west country and of Bristol being tumultuous, the Castle and walls were repaired, fortified and mounted with cannon; and guard kept day and night to prevent any surprize or insurrection. This reformation, which was but par tial, and inadequate to the corruptions of the then Popish Church of England, both in doctrine and practice, occasioned several formidable and danger ous rebellions. So tenacious are the populous sot their ancient errors and usages, however inconsistent with reason and propriety. Our erroneous ancestors held as sacred superstition and absurdity, and deem ed Reformation to be innovation ; and were types of their mistaken successors, who still set their faces against, and strenuously oppose, rational improve ment and rectification of abuses, and (like the Papists) will never begin to be right, till they see themselves to have been in the wrong. In 1545, a printing press was set up, and a mint established in the castle ; and the Church plate, seized at the desolution of Monas teries, was coined there. In 1602 a petitiou was presented to the Privy Council, from the mayor, &c. complaining that the governor (Sir John Stafford, knt.) being absent from"], [47, "27 Ihe castle, and leaving an unworthy deputy, about 240 persons were suffered to inhabit the castle, who were of lewed life and conversation, and subsisted by begging and stealing ; and that the castle was a sanc tuary, refuge, and receptical of malefactors, who flew hither to escape justice, ln consequence of this, the governor was ordered to remove such persons, and to admit none but of good behaviour, that the city might not be further molested. The Castle continued to be part of the county of Glocester for 256 years after Bristol had been made a county of itself: but the old complaints being reviv ed, of its affording an asylum to thieves, malefactors, and disorderly persons, and its being out of the juris diction of Bristol ; and also, that no Justice of Peace belonging to the county, resided in or near it. In the year 1629, king Charles the first, at the request of the mayor and citizens, by a charter, entirely se parated it from the county of Glocester, and made it a part of the city of Bristol. And in 1631, the castle, with all its buildings and appendages, were sold for ever, by the said king, to the mayor and burgesses of Bristol, for the sum of 959Z. paid into the Exchequer at Westminster. In the begining of the war between the King and Parliament, 1642, the Castle was repaired, and garri soned by the Parliament's army, under colonel Fien nes, who was made governor. This was a place of great importance, as it awed all the western counties, and had accommodation for a large army. King Charles therefore was desirous to have it in his pos session. The plot of Yeomans and Bouchier to de liver it up, not succeeding, prince Rupert beseiged it ; and seeing the improbability of taking the city and castle by blockade, resolved to storm it, which he did in six different places, so effectually that the besieged, being unable any longer to resist, capitulated. This capture was dearly purchased, the king lost many of his most valuable officers, and five hundred of his best troops, at the siege ; however, he was so well satisfied, that he ordered a public thanksgiving on the"], [48, "28 occasion : and when he came to Bristol on the third of August following with prince Charles, the duke of York, and several of the nobility, the King lodged at the house of alderman Creswick, in Small-street, and the prince and duke, at alderman Holesworthy's, di rectly opposite. After the king's defeat at the battle of Naseby, prince Rupert repaired to Bristol, which he found so well supplied with men, provisions, and ammunition, that he wrote to the king, assuring him he could sus tain a four months' siege. From the character of the prince, great expectations were formed, and most people concluded, that he would have made a vigor ous defence. Sir Thomas Fairfax having taken Sherborne castle, marched to Bristol, to undertake the siege ; but previously sent a summons to prince Rupert, to prevent bloodshed, which being very re markable, and still preserved, we present to our readers. \"TO P. RUPERT.\" \"SIR, \u2014 For the service of Parliament, I have brought their own army before the city of Bristol ; and do summon you, in their names, to render it, with all the forts belonging to the same, into my hands for for their use. Having used this plain language, as the business requires, I wish it may be as effectual to you, as it is satisfactory to myself, that I do a little ex postulate with you about the surrender of the same; which I confess, is a way not common, and which I should not have so used, but in respect to a person of such sort, and in such a place. 1 take into consider ation your royal birth and relation to the Crown of England, your honor, courage, and all the virtues of your person, and the strength of the place which you may think yourself bound and able to maintain. Sir, the Crown of England is, and will be, where it ought to be ; we fight to maintain it there. But the king, mis led by evil councellors, or through a seduced &neart, has left his Parliament and People uuder God, (the"], [49, "29 >est assurances of his Crown and Family :) the main lining of this schism is the ground of the unhappy vvar on your part; and what sad effects it hath pro iuced in the three kingdoms, is visible to all men. \"To maintain the rights of the crown and kingdom jointly, the principal part is, that the king is supreme, who acts concerning the whole State, is not to be ad vised by men of whom the law takes no notice, but by the Parliament, the great council of the nation, in whom (as much as man is capable of) he hears all his people, as it were, at once advising him ; and in which multitude of councellors lies his safety and his people's interest. To set him right in this hath been the constant and faithful endeavour of the Parliament; and to bring those wicked instruments to justice, who have misled him, is a principal ground of our fighting. \" Sir, if God make this clear to you, as he hath to us, I doubt not but he will give you a heart to deliver this place ; notwithstanding all the considerations of honor, courage, and fidelity, because their consistan cy, and use in the present business, depend upon the right and wrongfulness of what has been said ; and if upon such conviction you should surrender the city, and save the loss of blood, and hazard of spoiling such a place, it would be an act glorious in itself and joyful to us, for the restoring you to the endeared affections of the Parliament and People of England, the truest friends to your family it hath in the world. \" But if this be hid from your eyes, and so great, so famous, and so ancient a city, so full of people, be exposed, through your wilfulness, in putting us to force the same, to the ruin and extremity of war, (which yet we shall, in that case, as much as possible, endeavour to prevent), then I appeal to the righteous God to judge between you and us, and to requite the wrong. And let all England judge, whether to burn its towns, and ruin its cities, and distroy its people, be a good requittal fron a person of your family, which have had the prayers, tears, moneys and blood of the Parliament ; and if you look on"], [50, "30 either as now divided, both ever had the same party in Parliament, and among the people, most zealous for their assistance and restitution, which you now op pose and seek to distroy ; and whose constant grief hath been, that their desire to serve your family hath been ever hindered and made fruitless by that same party about his majesty, whose councils you act, and whose interest you pursue in this unnatural war. \"I expect your speedy answer to this summons, by the return of the bearer this evening, and am Your Highnesses humble srvant, Sept. 4, 1645. THO. FAIRFAX. Prince Rupert, in a short answer, desired no know if he might be permitted to sent a messenger to the king, which Fairfax denying, he offered to surrender the place upon condition, \" that every man should march away in the height of honor, with their arras, colours flying, drums, trumpets, and as much powder and match as they could carry about them : with bag, baggage, horse, arms, ten guns, and fifty barrels of powder. Lastly, the lines and fortifications to be slighted, and the city to be no more a garison.\" This, Fairfax would not admit of, and made prepara tions for a storm: and the city being set on fire in several places, a trumpet came from the Prince to desire a parley, and he was forced as last, to surren der; and on Thursday, September 11, he marched out of the great fort, and also many ladies and gen tlemen. Lieutenant-general Cromwell, sent to the Parliament a long account of the taking of Bristol, ealing it \"the work of the Lord, which none but an athiest could deny, for they had taken it, with the loss of only about 200 men.\" During the siege, Sir T. Fairfax, and Oliver Cromwell, were both sitting on the top of Prior's hill Fort, a ball was shot from a piece of ordnance in the castle, and grazed upon the sort, within two hands breadth \u25a0 of them, so narrow was their escape. The king was so vexed at this loss, and the trifling efforts made by the prince to preserve so important a"], [51, "31 city, that he revoked all his commissions, and wrote to him to quit the kingdom immediately ; but on the prince, justifying his own conduct, was afterwards reconciled. The two last constables of the castle were Major general Skipton and Mr. Adrian Scroop. The for mer was the person commissioned by the Parliament to carry ,\u00a3200,000 to the Scots, lo obtain the surren der of king Charles, which was effected in the year 1646; and the latter was executed at Charing-cross, after the Restoration, for being one of the High-court of Justice who sentenced Charles the 1. to death. After Oliver Cromwell was proclaimed Protector, he sent orders for the demolition of the Castle of Bristol, which was began in Janunry 1655, and the whole was razed to the ground, scarsely any vestiges of it being now remaining, ln 1656, a road and pre parations for a street to the Old market were made through the Castle ; before this, the common road was through Narrow Wine street and the Broad wear, to the county of Glocester. Thus was this fortress, which had been deemed impregnable in former ages, (before the invention of gunpowder) which has made such a distinguished figure in history, and been the subject of so much contention, totally destroyed, after having stood at least 600 years. It was soon built into streets and lanes, the principal of which are Castle street, Castle green, and Tower hill, now reckoned in the heart of the city, and constituting one of its principal wards. King Charles the II. after the battle of Worcester, in his several journies to conceal himself from his pur suers, by the assistance of his friends, once passed through this city on horseback, in disguise, dressed like a countryman, riding before Mrs Lane, to the ?reat manor-house, which stood, as Abbot's Leigh, near Bristol, where he lay concealed for some time, md used to turn the spit in the kitchen to prevent discovery ; the block on which he sat was preserved here for many years. (The present mansion was built jy, and is' the residence of Philip John Miles, esq.)"], [52, "32 In passing through the city he could not resist an inclination of turning a little out of his way to take a view of the castle, which had been the scene of so many interesting transactions. Had king Charles the 1st. been of so pacific a dis position as his more politic and judicious father, James the 1st, this nation would not have been harrassed and diminished by so long and distructive a war, and his life might have been preserved, to the comfort of his family, and the felicity of the people over whom Providence had placed him as a magistrate. It is the indispensible duty, and will be found to be the truest interests both now, and in future days, of all kings and governors of countries, to study the things that make for peace at home and abroad ; gloriously to distinguish themselves and elevate their characters as Peace-makers, and not as Peace-breakers; to become blessings to, and not plagues of society ; to be friends to the public, and not to be public enemies and destroyers ; and to lose all private interest in their ardent zeal for civil and religious freedom, commerce, riches, plenteous and cheap supplies, scientific im provement, reformation and true happiness, natural and moral, of the nation to whom they are related, and for whose benefit they ought incessantly to be concerned. The emperor Antonius Pius, when his parsimonious wife expostulated with him on his liberal donations to the people of Rome, thus nobly an swered, \" Dorit you know, that now ive are pit in possession of the empire, all we have is the properly of the people ! \u2014 Rex est, qui beno regit ; Tyrannus qui Populum opprimit."], [53, "CHAP. IV. History of the Progressive Augmentation of the Ancient City ; its J}7 alls, Gates, Sfc. ; its Extent, Circumfer- ence, Number of Houses, and Inhabitants. THE ancient walled city of Caer Brito, though famous, and consequently populous, before the arrival of the Saxons, did not extend one mile in circumfer ence. The conflux of people, occasioned by its early trade, and its growing extra connexions, rendered the narrow confines of its original wall incapable of containing the inhabitants, who began to erect buildings beyond it, both on the Glocester and Red cliff sides of the river. The suburbs on the Gloces ter side, soon made a second and external wall neces sary, long before the conquest, the extent and gates of which we have already noticed. The plan for building, on the Redcliff side, was more spacious than that of the old town; and the buildings and inhabi tants increasing there, walls and gates became as necessary as on the other side ; and it was very anci ently thus defended, long before the first bridge, which was of wood, was built across the Avon. The large and strong castle, with its outworks, when completed, as it joined closely to the old town, and the buildings on the southern side of the river, inclosed by a strong wall, were great additions to the city, and made the circumference of the whole, at least, two miles and a half. The accession of the mo nastery of St. Augustine, and the Gaunt's church and Hospital to the west, and the priory of St. James to to the N. W. produced an increase of inhabitants in these agreeable situations. Testimonials are not"], [54, "34 wanting to prone, that the trade of Bristol at those times was so considerable as to effectuate a rapid progress of its buildings and enlargement. Andrew de Chesne thus discribes it as in the reign of King Stephen, \" Est Bristou civitas omnium frere regionis civitatum oppulentissima, eye.\" i.e. \"Bristow is the rich est city of almost all the cities of this country, re ceiving merchandize from neighbouring and foreign places, with the ships under sail.\" Lord Littleton, in his life of Hen. II. vol. 2, p. 177, quotes William of Malmsbury's authority, \"that Bristol was then full of ships from Ireland, Norway, and every part of Europe, which brought hither great commerce and much foreign wealth.\" And if it Avere a place of such trade so early, we may be assured that the buildings of the city were numerous and flourishing ; and that the inhabitants were so too, we need no other proof than the number of handsome churches (nine at least) that were crowded within the small compass of the walls of the ancient city. The enterprises of making a new key or haven, and of stopping up the former course of the Froom ; the building a new bridge over the Avon, (1247,) the in corporation of Redcliff with the Bristol in govern ment, markets and privileges, were attended with very beneficial consequences to the whole community, and made it to flourish exceedingly. The suburbs of Bristol increased greatly to the north and east. The fields and grounds under the walls to the N. and N.E. were regularly laid out and partly built 400 years ago. William of Worcester (1480) mentions Broadmead, Martall- street now (Merchant-street), St. James's back, and the Barrs now (Barrs-lane), then inhabited by common women. On account of the last increase, the church of the priory of St. James was made parochial in 1374; and the parishoners were bound by indenture to build a tower or belfry of stone at their own expense; and the bells were to be at the joint expense of the priory and parishoners. The unfailing growth of trade and foreign commerce ; the charters and privi-"], [55, "35 leges granted by various monarchs ; the dignity of ofbishoprick, granted by Henry VIII. ; the purchase, and addition of the castle to the city, and building it into streets, have all contributed to the extent, opu lence, and eminence of Bristol, down towards the close of the last century. Since that time, all the buildings in the city or suburbs, which have a modern appearance have been erected. In the reign of William 111. the marsh was laid out for buildings : and in due time, the spacious square, called Queen's, and Prince's-street, were fi nished and inhabited. The names of Ann-street, George's, and Eugene-streets, leave no doubt of the dates in which that large and populous suburb to the east was planned and built. Marlborough and Eu gene-streets in St. James's : Denmark and Hanover streets in St. Augustine's, remind us of the times in which those heroes flourished ; also of the husband of queen Ann, and the accession of the Hanoverian family. The best houses in College-green, Trinity, and Orchard-streets, with numerous other streets and places of modern structure, soon followed the former. But the chief enlargement of the city and the Hotwells has been within memory, by the addition of so many handsome streets, and elegant buildings, that the whole town is, at present, a third part more extensive than it was forty years ago ; and the industrious inha bitants have so improved their situation, that, after London, Bristol justly challenges the first place in the catalogue of English cities. Authorities have been already adduced to prove, that the ancient cityr, consisting principally of four streets, was inclosed and defended by walls and gates. The original gates were probably but four, to the N. E.S. and W. What their first names were, are now unknown, and it seems that St. Giles's Gate, and the gate in Tower lane were of subsequent date to the rest, erected when buildings increased in the city, and without it, in the time of the Saxons. The east ern gate of the city was in Wine-street, at about the western corner of Dolphin-street, and was called"], [56, "36 Defence Gate. The houses being increased without that gate to the castle, what is now Narrow Wine street, was called Castle-street, in William of Wor cester's time, 1480. At or near to the time in which the castle was repaired by the earl of Glocester, ano ther gate was erected close to the castle walls for Srotection of the whole city, and the suburbs without lefence Gate, which was named New Gate. On the north-east side of this gate were the statues of Robert, earl of Glocester, and Godfrey, bishop of Constance, which, at the demolition of the gate, were preserved, and erected in niches at a gate, at the seat of a gen tleman at Brislington. Since 1480, Defence Gate had been taken down as useless. After the erection of Christian churches, and laterly, the six gates were known by the names of St. Leonard, or Blind Gate, St. Nicholas, Newgate, Tower-Gate, St. John's, St. Giles's ; six in all, of which, only two, St. John's and Tower lane Gate, are remaining in the ancient and original wall of Caer Brito. From the well known situation of these gates, the walls may be precisely traced to this day. The town being enlarged by the Saxons, other and external walls and gates became necessary for its defence. The gates of these walls were, \u2014 1st, Law ford's Gate, (on the eastern side of which were two statues of West-Saxon kings, who were crowned with diadems or coronets, and may be viewed at the above mentioned gate at Brislington;) the Pithay Gate: Needless Gate, Bridewell Gate, formerly called Monk ton Gate, Froom Gate, which had two arches ; Marsh Gate, which stood at the western end of Marsh-street Back-street Gate, and the Back Gate. It is noticed by Camden, and various other histori ans, that Bristol had a double wall in the time of William Rufus. And there is not any reason to doubt, that the outer wall, built to protect the sub urbs, which the increase of the inhabitants had occa sioned in the time of the Saxons, was the second and last wall, as we have not any account of another on the Glocester side of the water."], [57, "37 The Redcliff side was defended by a wall at an early period.which had two Gates, Temple and Red cliff. On this side, some parts of the old wall remain, for two or three furlongs in length, having, in various places the battlements visibly filled up. On the other side of the river, a very ancient rotund building, or tower, is still standing on the outer wall, near to the river Froom ; and mayr be seen from the hinder parts of the houses on St. James's back. Af ter the demolition of the castle, two gates were built for the precincts, Castle Gate, and Queen's Gate, or the Sally Port. So that Bristol had, in all, no less lhan 18 gates, three only of which remain, the two before-mentioned, in the old wall, and Bridewell Gate in the second wall. The increase of the town, which made a second wall necessary, being in the time of the Saxons, we have sufficient reason to conclude, that it was about the year 930, in the reign of king Ethelstan : and also that some parts of the walls were built by Ayl ward, the Fair, surnamed Snow, if not all of them. For the Pithay Gate was formerly called Aylward's Gate ; and the bridge under it Aylward's bridge. And so lately as 1480, William of Worcester, in his memoirs of Bristol, called the Pithay, Aylward street, and the gate, Aylward's Gate. See page 184 of Nasmitlis Edition of William of Worcester. When the Castle Gate was taken away, its materi als were erected on a similar scale, at a gentleman's seat near the road to Brislington, who ornamented it with four very ancient statues from Lawford's gate and Newgate, as above noticed. Temple Gate, was a lofty and elegant arch of free stone, with two posterns for foot passengers ; rebuilt in 1734. It was ornamented, and strengthened on each side, by four rusticated Doric columns. Over the gate there were, under a pediment, the arms of the city toward the country, and of the king toward the city. This gate is taken down. St. John's Gate, is the northern gate of the old town, and has, on the southern side, statues of kings"], [58, "38 Brennus and Belinus, the latter of whom was the supposed founder of Bristol. A late author has asserted, that \"the statues appear to be as ancient as the town itself; but the gate which is a handsome gothic arch, the tower and spire upon it, and the ad joining parish church, were built anew in the 14th century, by Walter Frampton, three times mayor, and an opulent merchant of Bristol ; whom William of Worcester styles \" Mercator noblis\" a noble mer chant. Tower Gate, in Tower-lane, at the end of St. John-street, must be very ancient, is a plain arch in a thick wall of the old city ; has a lofty house built upon it; and now, steps of stone under it, to help the declivity, and for foot passengers only. Bridewell Gate. This was formerly a place of great strength, fortified with bulwarks and a tower, near to Bridewell, and which was then called Monk's Bridge. This bridge, which was of wood, has been built of stone. The two gates, that now enclose the fronts of Bridewell, and which were erected in 1721, are shut every night, and are modern monuments of the ancient building. The boundaries of the city on the Glocestershire side includes four miles and a half and 37 perches; and on the Somerset side two miles and a half and 18 perches : and the whole city is nearly eight miles in circumference. By an act of parliament in 1777 the liberties on the Glocestershire side were extended to Rownham passage, or ferry : the boundaries in some places extend beyond the buildings ; and in others, the buildings extend greatly beyond the boundaries; and it would therefore be difficult to ascertain the dimensions of die city itself, which is nearly of a cir cular form, with very large suburbs, especially to the east and west. To understand by Bristol, the city, and its connected suburbs, we shall give our readers the following account of its length and breadth. From the top of St. Lawrence-hill, east, to the top of Castle-street, one mile ; to the Thatched house Ta vern, in Limekiln-lane, two miles ; and to the Colo-"], [59, "39 nade at the Hotwell-house, west, more than three miles, above half the length of London and Westmin ster. The breadth of the city and suburbs from north to south is as follows : \u2014 From Stoke's croft Turnpike to the southern end of Bristol-bridge, is one mile \u25a0 to Guinea-street, Redclifl-hill, a mile and a half, and over Redclifi-hill and Highway, and through Bed minster to the end of the buildings in the Bridgwater road, or to Ashton Turnpike, upwards of two miles and a half. Concerning the number of houses and inhabitants in Bristol, and its suburbs, we shall give our readers the amount according to the Census taken in 1821, when it was found to contain, including Kingsdown, St. James, St. Paul, St. Philip and Jacob out parishes, with Bedminster and Clifton, 12,939 inhabited houses; 19,795 families ; males, 37,865,\u2014 females, 48,178, total 86,043."], [60, "CHAP. V Historical Notes of Bristol, with heads of Charters, from William the Conqueror, to the year 1825. In the year 1069, Harding, the ancestor of the Berkeley family, was a magistrate, and rich merchant of Bristol. He was called mayor and governor of Bristol; and Leland says that he removed the fraternity of Calendaries (a society existing here before the Conquest) to the church of All-Hallows, which before were at Christ church. 1090. Bristol, from its situation, was famous for its voyages and trade to Ireland. The following trade, recorded in the life of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester, in Anglia sacra, shews the barbarism of those times (thus rendered from the Latin). \"There is a town called Brickstou, opposite to Ireland, and extremely conveniant for trading with that country. Wulfstan induced them to drop a barbarous custom, which neither the love of God nor the king could prevail on them to lay aside. This was the mart for slaves, collected from all parts of England, and par ticularly young women, whom they took care to pro vide with a pregnancy, in order to enhance their value. It was a most moving sight to see, in the public markets, rows of young people, of both sexes, (tied together with ropes,) of great beauty, and in the flower of their youth, daily prostituted, daily sold, Execrable fact ! Wretched disgrace ! Men unmind ful of the affections of the brute creation, delivering into slavery their relations, and even their very off spring ! \""], [61, "41 1110. Robert, Earl of Glocester, was lord of Bristol, and rebuilt part of its Castle, and fortified it against king Stephen, whom he took and confined a prisoner in it for the empress Maud. This Robert married Mabile, the heiress of Robert Fitzhaymon, lord or governor of Bristol in the year 1090, and by his marriage obtained the lordship, and built the tower in the castle, according to Robert the poet of Glocester : ' 'And Biistow throw hyss Wyfe was alsoe hys, And he brogt lo gret sia the Toune as he yut ys, And rerde there an Castle myd the noble Tour, That of alle the lours of Englonde ys yielde the floure.\" The empress Maud landed near Arundel, with but 140 men, whom Stephen hastened to meet : but she colouring her designs with the pretence of amity and peace, he credulously caused her to be honourably conveyed to Bristol, where she remained two months, while Earl Robert gathered aids for her. At the battle of Lincoln, Robert earl of Glocester, encountered the king's forces ; Stephen, with un daunted courage, fought until his battle-axe broke, and his sword was shivered in pieces : when being weaponless, he wras taken, and conveyed to the em press at Glocester, from whence he was sent prisoner to Bristol castle, the empress for a while excercising all authority. Bristol and its Castle being in the possession of Robert, and Maud, that lady placed her son here to school, among the sons of the chief men of the town, as recorded by Baker in his Chronicle. \" He was brought into England by his uncle Robert, and was put to school at Bristol, being then about nine years old, and was under the tuition of one Matthews, (who lived in Baldwin street, opposite the back of the new market) where he remained four years.\" Here he grew very partial to Robert Fitzharding, and when he came to the crown, he knighted him, then mayor or gover nor of Bristol after his father, and made him heir of the estate of Berkeley.

Henry II. granted a charter to the men of Redcliff, to this purpose, \" Henry, king of England, &c.to all barens, justices, sheriffs, &c. wisheth health: 1 grant that my men that dwell in my fee in the marsh near the bridge ofBristow, have their certain customs and liberties and aquittances through all England and Wales, as my burgesses, and namely those of Bris tow, as my charter testifies : and I forbid that any one do them any injury or reproach upon this ac count.\" By this charter it appears, that there was a bridge over the Avon in Henry the second's time, which in all probability was constructed of wood. 1172. The king further granted to his burgesses of Bristol, to be free from all toll and other customs throughout England, Wales and Normandy. In his time Bristol was so populous and flourishing, that he gave to it the grant of the city of Dublin in Ireland, to inhabit, possess, and enjoy it, and a large colony from Bristol was accordingly sent there. 1190. John earl of Morton, (afterwards king) being lord of Bristol, renewed its charter, which ascertained the then boundaries of the city, confirmed the privi leges of its inhabitants, and secured their property. 1196. Richard the I. taxed the burgesses, who paid 200 marks X133 6s. 3d. and for the Fairs, ten marks, \u00a3Q 13s. 4d. which shews the antiquity of the fairs of Bristol. 1201. There was a treasury in Bristol ; and the town paid an aid for the king's passage to Ireland of 1000 marks, and the men of Redcliff 1000 marks. The Redcliff side being perhaps as large and opulent as Bristol, might occasion the whole (as one town) to be anciently reckoned in Somersetshire. 1209. King John issued a proclamation at Bristol, forbidding the taking of all sorts of feathered game throughout England. 1210. The king laid a heavy tax on all the Jews."], [63, "43 An opulent Jew who resided in Bristol, named Abra ham, refused to pay this tax, for which he was fined 10,000 marks ; this he also refused to pay ; on which the king ordered that one of his teeth should be drawn everyday till the sum was paid; the Jew hav ing only eight teeth lost seven of them, and then paid the money to save the last. 1210. About this time, prince Henry, eldest son of king John, (afterwards Henry III.) was, on account of the troublesome wars in which his father was en gaged with the barons, placed in Bristol, to be in safety during his minority, and to receive an educa tion suited to his high station, he having with him. several noblemen and tutors for that purpose. 1215. King John, after a series of troubles with the barons, left his son Henry to succeed, who was proclaimed and crowned at Glocester. Guallo, the Pope's Legate, in the presence of Henry III. held a synod at Bristol, in which Louis, the French king's son, who had been invited over by the barons, was excommunicated, which strengthened the interest of the newly-crowned king. 1216. The king with his counsellors and tutors, came to Bristol, and granted the burgesses a new charter, which enacted that they should be governed by a mayor afcer the manner of London, with two \" grave, sad, worshipful men,\" who were to be called Prepositors. The first mayor chosen in consequence of this charter, was Adam le Page. 1239. The ground about the marsh of St. Augustine was purchased of Abbot Bradstone, for making the trench or canal, on which was afterwards built the quay. 1247. The mayor, burgesses, and commonalty of Bristol, with the joint charges of the men of Redcliff and the governors of Temple fee, turned the coursa of the river Avon, by cutting a canal from Redcliff back to Tower Harriatz, and built a bridge of stone over it. This at length had lofty houses erected on each side of it, with a chapel across the bridge in the centre, like a gateway. And, whereas a market bad"], [64, "44 been previously held on each side of the water; it was now ordered that all provisions should be brought to one market, to be held at and by the High Cross, at tbe confluence of the four principal streets. 1256. King Henry granted two new charters, which ordained, that the burgesses of Bristol should choose a coroner ; that successors should inherit the goods of deceased relatives, that the inhabitants should be as free as those of London ; that the mayor when chosen should be presented to the constableof the castle, &c. This year there was a grevious famine in Bristol, wheat sold at sixteen shillings the bushel ; and good provi sions were so scarce, that the people eat the carcases of dogs and other carrion. 1263. Prince Edward was a prisoner in the castle of Bristol, and in 1265, took it from the barons, and fined the town ,\u00a31000. 1272. There were twelve furnaces here for melting silver, and hammering and stamping of money. 1 278. King Edward and Llewellin, prince of Wales, were at war, in the midst of which four ships of Bris tol took a prize near the island of Scilly ; in which was the intended spouse of Llewellin, and daughter of Simon de Montfort ; which service was well ac cepted by the king. 1283, King Edward the I. came from Wales to Bristol about the middle of December, kept his Christmas here with much satisfaction, and held a Parliament ; and this year issued out the first regular summons by writ to the mayor and magistrates here, requiring that two persons should be sent as repre sentatives to serve in his Parliament at Shrewsbury. 1305. King Edward I. taxing all the corporate cities and towns, Bristol paid JC<\u00b100. 1308. King Edward II. accompanied Piers Grave ston to Bristol, to bring him on his way to Ireland. 1326. Queen Isabel marched from Oxford to Bris tol, which she besieged and took, and in it Hugh Spencer, the elder, aged ninety, whom she caused to be hanged in his armour, in the sight of the king and his own son Hugh. After his body had been"], [65, "45 han\u00b0*ed for four days he was beheaded, and then cut in pieces and thrown to the dogs. Upon this the king and Hugh Spencer the younger, entered a little vessel behind the castle, designing to get to Lundy or to Ireland, but having been tossed about on the sea for a week, they landed in Wales, where the Welch men, for a reward of ,\u00a32000 delivered them up to the earl of Lancaster and his forces. Spencer was hung at London on a gallows thirty feet high ; and the king deposed and cruelly put to death in Berkeley castle. 1345. William de Colford, recorder of Bristol, drew up in writing the laws and liberties of the town ; and the mayor and 48 of the principal citizens, agreed on many useful laws, which were confirmed by the 5th of Edward the 111. Among these it was ordered, that no leprous man should stay within the precincts of the town, nor any common women remain within its walls ; and if such women be found, that the doors and windows of the house should be unhung, and carried by the serjeants of the mayor to tbe house of the constable of the ward, and there to be kept till the women be removed ; that no whore should appear in the streets, or within the bars of St. James's, with out their heads covered. 1386. Bristol was grown so opulent by commerce, that when the king was threatened with a French in vasion, the citizens lent him J/200, as much as York, or any city, excepting London. 1397. In the reign of Richard II. Henry duke of Lancaster, afterwards Henry IV. invaded England with an army of 60,000 men, marched to Bristol, be sieged the castle and took it, and in it two knights of the king's council, Busby and Green, whose heads were cut off, at the importunity of the rabble. 1399. Lord Spencer was beheaded by the Com mons, at Bristol, fora conspiracy against Henry IV. 1409. The Commons of Somerset, Bristol and Wilts, presented a petition to the king to empower them to remove all obstructions in the river Avon, that impeded the navigation between Bristol and Bath., For before the time of Richard I. the Avon was navi-"], [66, "46 gable to Bath, and wine, wax, salt, wool, skins, and cloth, used to be conveyed in vessels between both cities. 1422. A mint for coining was established in Bristol. 1446. A great part of the lofty spire of Redcliff Church thrown down by a violent tempest of thunder and lightning. The roof of the Church was beaten in, and the spire never rebuilt, but both repaired and covered, as at present, by William Cannings, an opu lent merchant. Also this year, king Henry VI. visited Bristol, and renewed the charter. 1456. Queen Margaret, with her nobility, came to Bristol. 1461. Edward IV. came to Bristol, and had Sir Baudwin Fulford, with Bright and Hessant, esqrs. beheaded. 1490. The streets were newly paved ; and the city gave tbe king 500/. as a benevolence. This year king Henry VII. with the Lord Chancellor came to Bristol, and kept his court at the great house in St. Augus tine's place. The citizens, willing to show his majes ty all the respect they could during his residence, dressed themselves in their best clothes. The king thinking that some of their wives were too well dress ed for their station, ordered, that every citizen who possessed goods to the amount of \u00a320 should pay 20*. for the sumptuous apparel of his wife. 1495. Henry VII. granted Letters Patent to John Cabot, merchant of Bristol, and to his three sons, Lewis, Sebastian, and Sanctius, for the discovery of new and unknown lands. 1497, Sabastian Cabot, discovered Newfoundland in his first voyage, the island of St. John, and the continent of America, which he sailed by quite to Florida. 1500. Henry VII. granted a new charter to the cor poration for six aldermen, a recorder, two sheriffs, forty common councilmen, a chamberlain, a seal, a water-bailiff, and gaol delivery.

King Henry gave a patent to Elliot and As-"], [67, "47 hurst, merchants of this city ; and to John Gonsalez, and Francis Fernandez, natives of Portugal, to go with English colours in quest of unknown lands. 1534. King Henry VIII. and his train were at Thornbury, and the mayor of Bristol sent him ten fat oxen and forty sheep ; and to queen Ann a silver cup and cover, with 100 marks of gold. One author says that the king came in disguise, with several gentlemen to Mr. Thorn's house, and secretly viewed the city, which Mr. Thorn shewed him, and being struck with the extent and appearance of the buildings, promised to make it a bishop's see, which he' afterwards did. This year there were great disputes about Laymens' preaching here, who were favored by the mayor, and some priests sent to Newgate ; and 1538 George Wisard, a heretic, preached in St. Nicholas church, and was ordered to bear a faggot for his erroneous doctrine. 1541. King Henry VIII. having suppressed the monastery of St. Augustine, erected it into a bishop's see ; and constituted Paul Bush its first bishop. Bristol was then, by sound of trumpet and proclama tion, declared a city and bishopric at the High Cross. 1543. The Litany was first sung in English, in a general procession from Christ-church unto St. Mary Redcliff. Queen Mary succeeded Edward VI. in 1553. In her short, but bloody reign, some Protes tants were burned on St. Michael's hill, for heresy. 1565. A wind-mill was erected on Brandon-hill by Mr. Read, the town's attorney, where, before stood the chapel of St. Brandon. 1574. Queen Elizabeth paid a visit to Bristol, and was entertained at the great house in Small-street, in which there is a room, still named queen Elizabeth's room. 1581. She granted a new charter for twelve aldermen, and for dividing the city into twelve wards. 1582. The mayor sent a letter to Sir Francis Wal singham, concerning the Bristol merchants' intention to furnish 1000 marks and two ships of 60 and 40 tons, for the discovery of some parts of the coast of America ; and Sir Francis returned a letter, greatly"], [68, "48 commending the zeal of the merchants for the west ern discovery. 1585. The earl of Pembroke came from AVales to Bristol to review the trained bands, and he having taken the upper hand of the mayor, and notice of it being given to the queen, she sent for him by post to court, and he was committed to the tower and fined, 1588. Four ships were fitted out from Bristol, to join the queen's fleet at Plymouth against the Spanish Armada. 1597. There was such a scarcity of provisions at Bristol, that persons of ability were obliged to keep as many poor people in their houses as their incomes would admit, for fear of an insurrection. Wheat 20s. the bushel. 1609. John Guy, of this city, having settled a co lony in Newfoundland, returned, leaving his son there, and in 1611 went back again, taking with him a minister, and several men and women. 1613. Queen Ann, princess of Denmark, wife of James I. came to Bristol, and was presented by the mayor, with a rich embroidered purse of gold ; and attended in a grand procession to her lodgings at Sir John Young's, at the great house in St. Augustine's place, (now Colston's School) where she was saluted with 42 great guns. On Sunday she went to the cathedral, and on Monday, at high tide, a sea-fight was exhibited on the river for her entertainment, and on Tuesday she went to Bath. She was so pleased with her reception here, that she gave the mayor a gold ring set with diamonds, worth 60/. saying, that \" she never knew she was a queen till she came to Bristol.\" 1625. By act of common council, Brandon-hill was adjudged to, and is the property of the mayor and sheriffs ; the citizens were allowed to dry clothes there. 1630. Charles I. by charter to the corporation, for the sum of \u00a3959 granted the castle and its precincts to be for ever separated from the county of Gloces ter, and to be made part of the city and county of Bristol."], [69, "49 1635. Bristol, in that year, paid above .\u00a325,000 for Customs; and gave \u00a3\"2163 13s. 4d. towards fitting out a fleet against France and Holland. 1638. Bristol felt the ill effects of the tyranical government. Commissioners and pursuivants were sent down, who examined on oath, merchants, what entries were made at the Custom-house, what com modities they had sent to sea, what foreign goods imported for years past, &c. In consequence of these examinations, some were compelled to accuse each other, and were sent for up to London. Shopkeepers had heavy imposts laid on them. Soap-makers paid \u00a3i custom per ton for soap. Brewers forty marks per annum for a commission ; these grievances set the people against the king and government. Four Aldermen, &c. went to complain to the king, who told them, with outward civility, that he was sorry for such hard commissions, which however he could not recal. They went to great expence about a trial, but could get no determination in their favor, and were imprisoned till they paid the amount of the exorbitant exactions, which were This year a ship was launched at the end of the Quay, out of which eleven Boys were drowned, and from thence she was called the Drownboy. 1641. War commenced between the king and par liament. Denzil Hollis was nominated to command the militia in Bristol. He subscribed \u00a34000 against the king. 1642 The Castle and Walls of Bristol were repair ed : a fort made at Brandon, and another at St. Mich ael's hill, now called the Royal fort. Two regiments under Colonel Essex were, by the contrivance of the mayor's wife and two other ladies, let into the city. The parliament made a weekly assessment on all cities and counties. Bristol paid \u00a355 15s. per week. 1643. Colonel Fiennes, governor of Bristol, disco vered a design of Robert Yeamans and George Bou shier, to deliver up the city to the king's forces ; upon which they were condemned by a council of war, and H"], [70, "50 hanged May the 30th, notwithstanding the king's letter to the mayor and citizens on their behalf. The same year on the 4th of July, Prince Rupert sat down before Bristol, and notwithstanding two citizens had be hanged for intending to deliver up the city to the king's forces, the design took effect, for it being at that time unprepared for resistance (of which Prince Rupert had notice from his correspondents within) the governor was obliged, after three days' siege, to surrender it to him : and on the third of August king Charles came to Bristol, and on Sunday attended divine service at the Cathedral church. 1645. The plague raged in this city, and about 3000 died. Fairfax summoned prince Rupert to deliver up the city to the Parliament, which at length he did. There were found here 140 pieces of cannon mounted ; 100 barrels of powder ; victuals in the royal fort for 150 men for 320 days ; the castle victualed for half so long. The prince had in garrison, 2500 foot, 1000 horse, besides 1000 trained bands and auxiliaries, so that the taking of this place was a great loss to the king, and of great importance to the parliament. 1649. King Charles having been tried and con demned at Westminster, was executed there, and the mayor of Bristol proclaimed, that there was no king in England, and that the successors of Charles the first, were traitors to the state. 1650. The walls about the Royal fort were made by order of Parliament, who gave \u00a31000 towards the building. 1653. The people called Quakers made their first appearance in Bristol. 1656. James Nailor, a fanatical enthusiast, made a public entry into Bristol, through Bed minster, as Jesus Christ. He was attended by several men and women, representing the deciples, Mary Magdalen, &c. who marched up to their knees in dirt, crying \" Hosanna to the Son of David, &c.\" Nailor, being apprehended, was brought before the mayor of Bris tol, who said to him (improperly) ' Art thou the Christi' to which he answered in the words Jesus, \" Thou"], [71, "51 sayestit.\" An account of this madman being trans mitted to London, Oliver Cromwell ordered that Nailor and his companions should be sent up for ex amination. The parliament passed sentence upon Nailor to stand in the pilory two hours, and then to be whipped by the common hangman ; his tongue to be bored through with a hot iron, and his forehead to be marked with the letter B ; and after to be sent to Bristol, and there publicly whipped. This man pro bably did not merit such severe punishment for his blasphemous mistake, because it was insanity. After the death of the Protector, he was discharged from his confinement, 1659, 1657. July 11th, Cromwell proclaimed Lord Pro tector, in Bristol. December 8th, the Corporation received a letter from the Lord Protector, a copy of which may not be unacceptable to our readers. OLIVER P. \"Trustie and well-beloved, we greet you well ; re membering well the late expressions of love that I have had from you, I cannot omit any opportunitie to express my care of you. I do heare on all hands, that the cavalier party are designing to put us into blood. We are, I hope, taking the best care we can, by the blessing of God, to obviate this danger. But our intelligence on all hands being, that they have a design upon our cittie, we could not but warne you thereof, and to give you authoritie, as we do hereby, to put yourselves in the best posture you can for your own defence, by raising your militia by virtue of the commission formerly sent you, and putting them in a readiness for the purpose aforesaid ; letting you also knowe that for your better encouragement herein, you shall have a troop of horse sent you to quarter in or near your towne. We desire you to let us heare from time to time what occurs touching the malignant partie, and so we bid you farewell. Given at Whitehall, this 2d of December, 1657.\" \"To our trustie and well beloved, the mayor, alder men, and common council of the city of Bristow.\""], [72, "52 In pursuance of this command, the militia was rais ed, and the city put into a posture of defence. 1660. The king was restored, May 29th. 1663. 5th of September, the king and queen, with James, duke of York and his duchess, prince Rupert, &c. came to Bristol, and were splendidly received and entertained by the mayor, at a dinner provided on the occasion ; 150 pieces of ordance were discharged in the marsh, (now Queen's-square) at three distinct times. The king knighted the mayor, sir John Knight, and the royal family went to Bath about four o'clock. 1664. Charles II, confirmed the charters of Charles I. of 1630 ; and 1633, a quo warranto being brought against the old charter, it was resigned into the king's hands. 1683. At the time of the Rye-house plot, a party was formed in Bristol, for seizing the city and the ships in the haven for the conspirators. 1684. Charles II. granted a new charter, in which he confirmed this place to be a city and county of itself; gave full power to the mayor and sheriffs to have a common seal, and to them and the common councilmen, not exceeding forty three, power to make laws for the government of the city. Mayor and sheriffs to be chosen the 15th of September, and sworn in on the 29th. The recorder to be a barrister of five years standing, and to have the royal approba tion. The Aldermen to be twelve, and the recorder the senior. A fine of \u00a3500 to be imposed on those who shall refuse to be chosen, unless not worth \u00a32000. The aldermen to be justices of the peace, and to hold a quarterly sessions for trying offenders. A town-clerk to be chosen, a barrister of three years, a steward of the sheriffs' court, and two coroners; the mayor, &c. to have the regulation of markets and fairs, and to hold pie-powder court, &c. 1685. There was a great alarm of the duke of Mon mouth's coming here from Taunton and Wells. In consequence of this, the duke of Beaufort, lord lieu tenant of the city, drew up twenty one companies of foot in Redcliff meads. The duke of Monmouth was"], [73, "53 certainly on his march towards Bristol, abounding in money, arms, stores, and in friends also, so that he intended to attempt its capture, being assured of assistance in the city : but the duke of Beaufort hav ing declared to the citizens that he would set fire to the town if they made an insurrection, Monmouth said, \" God forbid that I should bring the two cala mities of fire and sword together, on so noble a city.\" So he marched to Bath, Froom, and Bridgwater; where, from the top of the tower, perceiving lord Feversham's horse and foot lying at King's-Sedgmore, carelessly encamped, he determined to attack them in the night, but was defeated, and taken afterwardsj near Ringwood, in Dorsetshire, lying in a ditch\u00a3 covered with fern, in the habit of a peasant : he had some green peas in his pocket (on which he had sub sisted) with his George of diamonds. Not having slept for three nights, from exhaustion of spirits, he fainted and wept. He was beheaded at Tower hill, London, July 15th, aged 30. Judge Jefferies came to Bristol, and opened his commission with a long speech full of asperity against the citizens, accusing the mayor, &c. of pride, and of kidnapping away and selling abroad to their advan tage, fellows that had been brought before them for small crimes, and making them compound to be transported. Jefferies condemned six persons here for high treason ; three were reprieved. 1687. In January there came to Bristol, a letter and order of king James, for displacing the Protestant corporation, and for putting Papists in their stead, which was accordingly done. And in April the de claration was brought hither for the indulgence of all \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 i \u2022 persons in the free and public exercise of their reh lion, and in erecting meeting houses ; for which some Dissenters foolishly presented addresses of thanks ; all availed themselves of the liberty to which they had a right, but most parties suspected that the king intended under this mask to introduce Popery, nor did this appearance of moderation, nor his order for restoring displaced corporations avail, with men of"], [74, "54 sense, for many bishops and considerable men adhered to the prince of Orange, and military officers deserted to him. This year a Roman Catholic chapel was erected at Bristol in consequence of king James's declaration of liberty of conscience. 1688. The displaced corporation were restored by the king's proclamation, which concluded with his intention of calling a parliament, but all were fortu nately too late, for on the 5th of November, the prince of Orange landed at Torbay ; and on the 15th of Feb ruary, 1689, he and the princess were proclaimed king and queen in Bristol, which had been previously seized for theprince of Orange, by the earl of Shrews bury and Sir John Guise. The Roman Catholic chapel at Bristol was demolished by the populace. St. James's Fair, in the churchyard, this year, produ ced about \u00a380 to the churchwardens of the parish. 1690. King William landed from Ireland, opposite Pill, near Shirehampton, (now Lamplighter's hall) and went to Sir Robert Southwell's, at Kingsweston. 1691. The Clergy feast was established in Bristol, by bishop Hall. This year Sir John Knight, mayor, raised a work of stone round the Hotwell spring, higher than the tide ever rose. 1695. The first Hotwell house was built. 1701. The coronation day of queen Ann was cele brated in Bristol, with great solemnity, procession, fir ing of cannons, ringing, illumination, and burning an effigy of the Pope. 1702. On the first of September queen Ann visited Bristol, where the highest demonstrations of the loy alty and respect of the citizens and neighbouring gen try were paid to her. Her majesty and the prince of Denmark having been entertained with a splendid dinner, they returned the same evening to Bath. 1703. A great storm of wind and rain, that inun dated all the low fields and country about Bristol, down to Kingroad; and filled many cellars and ware houses in Bristol. The churches and buildings suf fered much from this storm, it was said to the amount of \u00a3100,000. Boats were sent from hence to save"], [75, "55 the lives of people who had taken refuge on trees and bushes. 1704. The number of ale-houses here were limited to 220. Stage-players were prohibited within the liberties, and the theatre in Tucker (now Bath) street, was converted into a Presbyterian meeting-house. 1708. Queen-square was laid out, and the buildings were begun. A scarcity and exportation of corn, occasioned an insurrection of the colliers, which was suppressed by reducing the price of wheat to 6s. 8d. the bushel. 1709. The present custom-house was built by the corporation ; the old house is yet standing on the Back. Redcliff church repaired at the expence of \u00a35000, which was raised by a brief, the chamber gave \u00a3200. 1710. Queen Anne having visiled Bristol, renewed its charter, confirming all other charters and liberties, and ascertaining its boundaries. This charter ordains that Bristol remain for ever a city incorporate, and county of itself ; and that its magistrates hold govern ment over all its boundaries by land and water : that the firm of the body corporate be, the mayor, bur gesses, and comonalty of the city of Bristol : that the mayor be chosen every 15th day of September; that the recorder shall be the first alderman ; with the others making twelve, according to the number of wards ; that the two sheriffs be chosen annually, out of the common council, which are to consist of 42 persons besides the mayor; that the mayor, aldermen and common council, shall have power to make and execute laws for the good of the city, and to sine and punish, not contrary to the laws and statutes of the kingdom ; that every recorder shall be a barrister of five years standing ; that the town-clerk and steward of the sheriffs' court be barristers of three years ; that the mayor, recorder, and aldermen, be all justices of the peace for city and county ; and shall try all trea sons, felonies, capital and criminal causes ; have power to hold four sessions of the peace in every year; to change the times and places of any of the"], [76, "56 markets, and to regulate them by reasonable and wholesome laws of their own making, for the benefit of the persons resorting to them ; and finally, that the mayor, burgesses, and comonalty of the city of Bristol, and their successors, shall have and enjoy all jurisdictions, liberties, powers, franchises, exemp- tions, privileges, emoluments, and hereditaments that were enjoyed by their ancestors, or that any kings and queens of England have heretofore made, grant- ed, or confirmed. These are the principal heads of this charter, which may serve to refute the vulgar error that Bristol has none, and that its magistrates are self created. Many acts of parliament have been ob- tained since this, for watching, lighting, and paving; maintenance of the poor, building Bristol bridge, and widening avenues to it ; for building and re-building several churches ; for a floating-dock, and the ex- tending the boundaries of the city ; for regulating police, hackney coaches, and many other necessary and useful purposes. Queen Ann was the last monarch who publicly visited Bristol, and who granted it the principal, and last grand charter for its good government and peace. She was a pious, benevolent, and truly amiable wo man ; and an elegant pedestrian statue of her, might, if errected in one of the squares of Bristol, serve to perpetuate the memory of her private virtues and public benefits. 1711. An act of parliament was procured to com plete the navigation of the Avon to Bath, which was finished 1727, when the first barge went from Bristol to Bath laden with deals, lead, and meal. Custom house, Queen-square finished, cost \u00a31111 7s. 5d. 1713. Dr. Robinson, bishop of Bristol, was lord privy seal, and her majesty's plenipotentiary, at the congress of the Hague. 1714. October 21, George 1. was crowned at West minster. At Bristol the disaffected populace shewed their dislike, by committing several disorders in the streets, interrupting the public rojoicings made bv the king s friends, assaulting the houses and breaking"], [77, "57 the windows of those who illuminated them on that occasion. This year the draw-bridge, and two arches of stone over the river Froom were completed, at the sole expence of the corporation. 1715. In the rebellion, designs had been formed of insurrections in favor of the Pretender at Bristol, Bath, and Oxford, which were prevented by the vigil ance of government. The first Newspaper published in Bristol now appeared ; the same which was known till 1809 as Sarah Farley's Bristol Journal. 1720. The wharf of stone, from King street down towards the grove, was built at tbe expence of the city. And about this time St. James's square was finished. 1726. An Act was obtained for placing Turnpikes round the city, but the Colliers not being exempted from payment, rose in a great number, cut down, and entirely destroyed them. 1730. The first incendiary letters ever known in the kingdom, were sent to divers persons here, with threats to set fire to their houses, if they did not leave sums of money in certain places. Mr. Packer, ship builder, had his house burned down in consequence which occasioned an alarm and double watch 'till six in the morning. 1733. The great crane at the gibb, built by the inge nious Mr. Padmore, and the mud-dock, completed at the expence of the merchants. 1734. Feb. 21st the Prince of Orange visited Bristol. 1736.

Fivers, Quays, Navigation, Docks, and Bridges. The river Avon, though inferior in breadth to the Thames, is one of the most notable, useful, and curi- ous rivers in England. As the Thames hath on its banks the two finest cities of the east, London and Oxford, so the Avon hath on hers, the two best and largest cities of the west : Bristol, the capital key and great mart of this country, and Bath, the most elegant city in the kingdom, without exception. This river rises in the northern limit of Wiltshire, and runs on the west of Breden forest (according to Camden) to Malmsbury, where it receives another stream, which rises at Tetbury, in Glocestershire, and nearly encircle the town of Malmsbury ; from thence to Melksham ; and having received a river that rises near Devizes, and a brook, called Barron's brook, thus increased, goes through the middle of Bradford under a bridge of eight arches. The author of a Tour through Britain, observes, in vol. 2, page 31. \"The river Avon, a noble and large fresh river, branching itself into many parts and re- ceiving almost all the rivers on that side of the hill, waters the whole fruitful vale : and the water of this river is particularly qualified for dying the best co lours, and for fulling and dressing the cloth ; so that the clothiers generally plant themselves on this river, but especially the dyers, as at Trowbridge and Brad ford, which are the two most eminent cloathing towns in that part of the vale, for making the fine Spanish cloths, and also for the nicest mixtures.\" From Bradford it leaves Wilts and enters Somerset ; then receiving the Froom from Froom-Selwood, and ano-"], [94, "74 ther river, it comes towards Bath. Here it rung through a fruitful vale bounded on each side by lofty and magnificent hills ; from whence the subjacent prospect of the country, the serpentive river, the fair and beautiful buildings of Bath, and its sublime and venerable cathedral, are quite enchanting. Here it runs under two elegant bridges, the first has three equal arches, with small shops and houses on it, handsomely constructed : and the other has five arches, with a balustrade of stone on each side. On the western side of this bridge is the quay of Bath, from whence the river is navigable to Bristol, so that Bath is a proper inland port. Barges that have but one mast and sail, and carry from 40 to 140 tons, lake heavy goods from Bristol, as iron, copper, wine, deals, and many other articles, and generally return laden with large blocks of freestone, or Bath stone, the use of which is increasing here. The river though quite fresh, is deep, of a good width, beautifully winds on towards Bristol in an exquisitely delightful and happy vale, between ver dant hills, rural scenes, and villiages ; about two miles and a half from Bath, it runs under a noble bridge of stone, of several arches, the principal of which is 100 feet in diameter. A little farther on is a lofty eminence, beautifully impending over its nor thern bank, on which are pleasantly situated, an elegant mansion and extensive and beautiful park. Seven miles from Bristol, between Saltford and Bit ton, at Swineford, it becomes the boundary between Glocestershire and Somerset, and so continues 'till it falls into the Bristol channel. On the east side of the tovyn of Keynsham it receives the river Chew, over which is a bridge on the Bath road : and below the bridge are considerable mills and manufactories for copper. Keynsham bridge has nine arches over the Avon, and near it is a lock to facilitate the navigation to Bath : at the highest tides the salt sea flows up to this town. At Brislington, Avon receives another stream, and flowing on by two works for smelting copper at Crew's hole ; according to the late improvement, it"], [95, "75 crosses the Bath road, over which place is built a fine iron bridge, of one arch ; then flowing at the foot of Pyle-hill, it proceeds through the Redcliff-meads, which instead of presenting verdant and rural scenes, (where the enthusiastic Chatterton used to recline, and utter ejaculations at the sublime aspect of Red cliff Church, lifting its solemn spires, brown with the shade of years,) almost a little town has been erected, and promises shortly to cover the banks of the river. It then continues its course under Harford's bridge through a romantic extent of gentle hills and delight ful meadows, and enters its accustomed path below Cumberland Basin. The two greatest churches of Bristol were so situated by our ancestors, as to be eminently conspicuous from its port. Below Redcliff, at the quay, is the mouth of the river Froom, below which, on each side of the water are delectable views of Bristol, Clifton, and the Somerset hills, down to Rownham ferry, a mile farther, where the river at high water is 300 feet broad, and the tide rises 32 feet. Here it begins to flow between two rising hills, Clifton and Rownham, the former adorned with elegant piles of building, and the latter with trees and verdure. Beyond the Hotwell-house commence the loftv rocks of St. Vincent, between which the river has a winding course of about two miles. The height of these rocks, (about 300 feet) the stupendous manner in which they are cleft by Divine Power to let the water pass through, some being nearly perpendicular, others impending, some bare and craggy, and others covered with trees up to the summit, afford scenes which perhaps England cannot parallel, and which richly merit the imitative powers of the painter, and the skill of the engraver. The shores are elevated and beautiful down to Hungroad, a safe hardour for large ships, and where some are unloaded into lighters. Below this is Pill, a sort of port town for the habitation of pilots and others, Here the river is about 500 feet wide, and the tide rises 40 feet at least. From Pill, it flows through a level country for about three miles to its mouth in the"], [96, "76 Severn sea, eight miles below Bristol. Here is Iving road, where the ships take there departure, which is rekoned a good open harbour, with safe anchorage. The river Froom rises at Dodington and Range worthy, not far from Tetbury in Glocestershire : and running through Acton, Hambrook, and by Frenchay to Stoke, meets a spring from the Duchess of Beau fort's park, then to Stapleton through Baptist mills, and enters Bristol through Traitor's bridge. Before the present quay was formed and built, in 1247, the Froom ran from St. Giles's bridge through the scite of the present Baldwin street, beneath the wall of the old city, and emptied itself into the Avon near St. Nicholas church. The Quay of Bristol is upwards of a mile in extent or circuit, reaching from St. Giles's bridge down to the mouth of the Froom, and up the old Avon to Bris tol bridge ; being one uninterrupted spacious wharf of stone, having sufficient depth of water before it for ships of the greatest burden, and fully laden, to come up to the walls and discharge their cargoes. It has different names, as the Quay, Broad quay, the Grove, and the Back. Cranes are erected in proper situations for loading and unloading, which are all numbered, for the more readily finding the subjacent vessels. On the banks of both rivers are several dock-yards and dry and floating docks for building and repairing the ships. There are two or three by the Froom, besides the various docks at Wapping by the Avon, where is also a spacious wet dock, with double gates. Below these, beyond Limekiln dock towards the Hotwells, is a large floating-dock, that will contain forty sail of stout ships deeply laden, and which in 1769, received a 64 gun ship with ease through its gates. Here are also other docks, a dry dock that will hold a 74 gun ship ; and dock-yards where have been built several large ships of war for government. At all these places ship-building and repairing are carried on with great spirit, skill, and industry. We have already noticed that there was a bridge"], [97, "77 over the Avon in 1173, which was probably of wood, for in 1767, when the workmen perforated the old piers to try if they were strong enough to support the new bridge, they found in the middle of Redcliff' pier, a sill of oak, about a foot square and forty feet long, with two uprights near each end, about nine inches square, and nine feet high, morticed into it, which they concluded to be the remains of the old wooden bridge, walled up in the pier to prevent the trouble of taking them out. The old bridge of stone was built 1247, and taken down in 1761. The present Bristol Bridge was opened in 1768; built of hewn stone, brought from Courtfield in Mon mouthshire, it consists of three arches; the centre arch is elliptical and of 55 feet span, the side arches are semicircular and of 40 feet each. The piers are 42 feet long and 10 thick. On each side is a balus trade of Portland stone, six feet high, and a raised way for foot passengers, defended by small iron pil lars and chains ; at each end are two buildings of stone for toll Houses, now converted into shops. Where the Gibb ferry formerly stood, a swing bridge has been erected, leading to Bathurst basin. The lowest bridge over the Froom hath two arches of stone, (and as it crosses the Quay) a Draw-bridge to admit coasting vessels and Severn trows to pass through it. The next is St. Giles's at the head of the Quay, which has two arches ; also Froom bridge just above, and is encumbered with houses. Then follow St. John's, Bridewell, Needless, Pithay, Union, Merchant, Philadelphia, Ellbridge, Penn and Trai tor's, all one arch bridges of stone ; so that over this little but useful river, there are thirteen bridges in the city and suburbs. There are four Ferries over the Avon; one from Queen street to Temple back, one from the Back to Redcliff, one from the Grove to Guinea street, and one from Rownham, Hotwells, to Somersetshire. The fare at each, for foot passengers, one halfpenny."], [98, "CHAP. VII. Fairs, Markets, Coals, and Wholesome Waters of Bristol. Bristol has long been famous for its fairs, which are still very considerable and well frequented, and some of the largest in the kingdom ; each of them for all sorts of wares and merchandize, and the time of both chartered for eight days. St. James's Fair, which is the greatest of the two, commences on the 1st of September, and is held in the spacious churchyard of St. James's, and in some adjacent streets. Temple Fair begins on the 1st of March, and is held in the Great Gardens and about Temple-street, on the southern side of Bristol bridge. At these fairs is usually a great sale for every thing in the woollen manufacture, cloth, coarse and fine; carpets, rugs, blankets, and stockings ; cotton stock ings from Tewkesbury, linen cloth ; hardware from Birmingham, Sheffield, Walsal, and Wolverhampton; millinery, haberdashery, ribbons, female ornaments, dresses, and trinkets, from London and other places; lace, from Notinghamshire and the west ; buck, doe, and hog skins for breeches ; and a great show of horses and cattle on the two first days. For the juvenile throngs, and those who are fond of delica cies, a rich profusion of confectionary wares, toys, &c. are exposed for sale in the rows. For the amuse ment of the populace, there are not wanting a variety of exhibitions, which are generally well attended. The shops and standings for these fairs are built and covered with wood. At St. James's they are disposed"], [99, "79 into streets and rows, and are generally a month in preparing. During these fairs there is more tanned leather sold at tbe Leather-hall than at any other fair in England. The fair, or chief day at this hall, is held on the 1st Tuesday in March and September. The Markets of Bristol are the following. 1. The EXCHANGE or GENERAL MARKET. This has a very handsome entrance from High-street, consisting of a lofty gate, and a gate-house over it, all of freestone. This is the principal market, and is situated on the south side of the Exchange. The rows for butchers' meat are constructed of wood ; are eight in number; the stands in these rows are 150. They have been completely rebuilt on a much more convenient plan, with chutters, gates, &c. There are three other market-houses, which are covered arcades of considerable length and breadth. In these the farmers and country folks sell butter, cheese, poultry, eggs, pork, bacon, and many other articles. One of these has a noble appearance ; is in the south front of the Exchange, and is called the Glocester market ; the number of stands here are 62. The arcade to the west is called the Somersetshire market, and the stands are 88. The other arcade to the east, extend ing from the butchars' rows to the market-gate, has 68 stands ; on the outside of this arcade are several stands for fruit, &c. Opposite to these are 12 stalls for vegetables, &c. ; also thirteen others of freestone, near the Post office, and ten covered stands before the south front of the Exchange, all for vegetables, fruit, &c. Between the butchers' and Somersetshire arcade is a row often covered stands for vegetables. II. St. NICHOLAS MARKET, St. Nicholas street, a neat modern building, entirely covered in, for country farmers and butchers, on Wednesday and Saturday. HI. St. JAMES's MARKET in Union-street, for every sort of animal and vegetable food, as the others ; the stands are numbered in the same manner, and are open every day for vegetables, but for butch ers' meat, only Wednesday and Saturday. ["], [100, "80 IV. At the BUTCHER-ROW, near LawfordV place, is a market every Wednesday and Saturday, for butchers' meat. V. The FISH-MARKET in Union-street, is plen tifully supplied with every kind of fish in its proper season; tbe market days are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Also, at the sheds on tbe Back, fish of various sorts are sold, particularly oysters, which are brought by the boats in great quantities' sufficient to supply town and country. VI. At the WELCH MARKET-HOUSE on the Back, opposite to King-street, are for sale every Wednesdsy, pigs for roasting, geese alive, or ready for the spit, turkey, ducks, and fowls. Large quantities of apples, pears, plums, damsons, walnuts, filberts, and hazel-nuts, in their seasons, which occasion a vast plenty of those fruits in all parts of Bristol. VII. The CHEESE-MARKET, opened in Jan. 1787, is held every Wednesday and Friday in Corn market-lane, in two convenient market-houses, built for the sale of corn, but now discontinued. V11I. Corn and Flour for the use of the distilleries, malt-houses, brew-houses, corn-factors, and bakers, are brought by water carriage, from the west country, the vale of Evesham, and counties of Hereford, Mon mouth, Glamorgan, and Worcester, and landed at the Quay, or the Back, the sales of which are now effected in the Exchange, where each Corn-factor has his stand for samples, and where returns of sales are deposited. IX. ST. THOMAS's MARKET is held every Thursday, for horses, living cattle, sheep and pigs, in St. Thomas street. X. In Broadmead is a large market for Hay and Straw, every Tuesday and Friday. XL The market for the sale of raw hides, calves' skins, and all sorts of un wrought tanned leather, is held at the Leather-hall, near the back, every Wed nesday and Saturday throughout the year. And at the same place is a market for tanned leather every Thursday."], [101, "81 Wood for firing, faggots, brooms, and timber of all sorts, are for sale on the Back. Great quantities of cider are brought to the Back, and to the head of the Quay. All sorts of fish, vegetables, and fruit, fresh butter, and numerous other articles, are hawked and cried daily about the streets, which are resounding from morning to night with the harsh music of those ambulatory, mercantile orators. The advantages arising to the inhabitants from hav ing plenty of coal so near to the city, are very great, as well from its use to families, as to the various manu factories, in which there is a great consumption of it. There are pits all round the city, in Glocestershire, at Kingswood ; and in Somerset, at Bedminster, Ashton, Nailsea, and Brislington. But the most copious supply is from Kings-wood, in which there are a great number of pits and collier's houses, which last are so frequent and numerous, that Kingswood has, from the neighbouring hills, the appearance of being one vast, rural suburb of Bristol. From tbe before-mentioned places, coals are brought to Bris tol in waggons and carts, and sold in sacks at 18d. and 20d. which holds about two bushels. Great quantities of coals are brought from Wales, in ships, and sold at the various wharfs at 16s. and 17s. per ton, according to the quality. The sweetest and most wholesome Waters from pumps and conduits, placed in many streets, are always to be had here in tbe greatest plenty ; for the support and supply of which competent benefactions have been left, by well-disposed citizens. The con duits, properly situated in various parts of the city, are supplied from various springs which rise in the neighbourhood, and are conveyed in leaden pipes. The pumps both public and private are numerous, and most of them emit from the sand, rocks, and strata beneath, the clearest and most beautiful water. M"], [102, "CHAP. VIII. Civil Government, Corporation, Officers, Jurisdiction, Courts, Wards, Prisons, Trading companies, Halls, Lighting, Paving, Police, and Arms of Bristol. SOME of the principal characters and noblemen in England have been High Stewards of Bristol, since the reign of Henry V1I1. In the year 1651, Oliver Cromwell sustained that character; his salary was \u00a35 per annum, and a pipe of canary ; half a ton of Gascoine wine was sent to him as a token of respect. The present High Steward is the Right honorable Lord Grenville. The government of this city is administered by a mayor, (whose person and office are highly respected here) a recorder, twelve aldermen, all justices of the peace, two sheriffs, and an under sheriff, twenty-eight common councilmen, town-clerk, chamberlain, and vice chamberlain, steward of the sheriffs' court, clerk of arraigns, register of the court of conscience, &c. There are other officers pertaining to the Cor poration \u2014 sword-bearer, two coroners, water bailiff, quay warden, school-masters, clerk of the markets, keepers of the prisons, inspector of nuisances, eight sergeants at mace, who carry maces of silver ; crier of the court, common crier, exchange keeper, sheriffs' officers, club men, beadles, a city marshal, and a good band of musicians in constant pay ; all of whom have their particular gowns, dresses, and liveries, in which they precede the corporation in public processions, which are made in a long range of elegant carriages. They have the highest mark of honor granted to magistracy, scarlet ermined gowns, gold fringed gloves, four swords, (presented to the mayors \u00ab\u00bb"], [103, "83 various occasions, one by king Henry VII. and a very old one in an embroidered sheath, with this motto, John Willis of London maier Gave to Bristow this swerde faire.) a mace and cap of maintenance. Gentlemen of the greatest worth and capital in the city, deem it an honor to serve this large community in the magisterial capacity. The two sheriffs are chosen out of the common council ; the mayor of those who have served the office of sheriff; and the aldermen of those who have been mayors. This opulent corporation are possessed of very large estates, both in city and country, in trust for chari table uses and the public emolument of the citizens ; for supporting hospitals, schools, alms-houses, and exhibitions at the university, for establishing lectures and gift sermons for the instruction of the people, for relieving the prisoners and confined debtors, for keep ing the poor at work, for the marriage of poor free mens' daughters, for repairing the roads round the city; and especially of large funds for the use of young tradesmen; \u00a3100, .\u00a350, .\u00a325, or less, to be lent to them, free of interest, for seven or ten years. The corporation are also patrons of several church livings in city and country, and have it in their power to promote and establish young clergymen of genius, learning, and real worth. The jurisdiction of Bristol, by water, extends up to Hanham : from thence downwards it reaches to Kingroad, and from thence down the Bristol channel, as low as the Flat Holmes (on which is a light-house seventy feet high, and a public-house) and to the Steep Holmes (noted for being the place of retirement of Gildas, the ancient British historian) and from thence eastward to the Denny island, and from theuce again to Kingroad. By the Charter of king Edward IV. 1461, Bristol was exempted by land and water from the jurisdic tion of the Admiral of England j and a commission^"], [104, "84 was to be granted by the crown to the mayor and recorder, as often as shall be needful, to inquire into all such contracts, agreements, trespasses, and offen ces, which were wont to be inquired of, and deter mined by such admiral, or in the court of admiralty, so that the mayor, recorder, and aldermen hold in the Guildhall a sessions for general jail delivery, and trial of all capital and criminal causes, within the city and liberties, on land or water, as often as may be neces sary, once or twice a year, at spring or fall, A court of Nisi prius for lawsuits, entirely respecting civil causes, is held in the said hall, in the autumn of every year, by one of the Judges who go the western circuit. The mayor and aldermen with the town-clerk (who presides as judge) hold a Quarter sessions for trying less criminal causes ; also a Court of Request is held every Tuesday, for debts above 40s. and under \u00a315, and a Court of Conscience for the recovery of debts under 40s. is held every Monday. The two sheriffs hold courts in the Guild-hall for determining writs of inquiry; and a Pie-powdre court in autumn, under a piazza in Old market street. The mayor, or some of the aldermen, hold a daily sessions in the Council-house, to hear complaints and accomodate difterances ; make orders, take bail, and commit offenders. The Corporation have several processions in the year : at Michaelmas, to St. Mark's Church, to hear divine service, before the mayor is sworn into office at the Guildhall ; and to the same church with the recorder, previously to the trial of capital offenders. Also on the 29th of May, and the 5th of November, they go in their coaches, preceded by their officers, and music, to attend divine service at the cathedral church ; on the last of those days, after their return from church, one of the scholars of the city grammar school, being elevated in the Council-house, comme morates the deliverance from the powder-plot, in a latin oration to the corporation and croud attending ; when he has finished, he dismounts, and goes to the mayor, who rewards him with a piece or pieces of"], [105, "85 gold, according to the merit of his performance. It is an ancient custom of the corporation, and still con tinued, to visit every Whit-sunday, and attend divine service in the forenoon, at the old venerable church of St. Mary Redcliff, which on this occasion is dressed with flowers, strewed with rushes and crouded with people. - Every Mayor is allowed \u00a32000 from the chamber of Bristol, to support the dignity of his office, and the two Sheriff's have \u00a3400 each. This city is divided into twelve wards : \u2014 Trinity St. Mary-le-port St. Michael's Castle Precincts St. Ewin's St. Stephen's All Saints' St. Nicholas St. James's St. Mary Redcliff Temple St. Thomas's each of which has an alderman to preside over it. The recorder is always one of the aldermen, and by virtue of his office is reckoned the principal ; his ward is Trinity. The present recorder is the Right Honor able Lord Gifford. The senior alderman after the recorder, is stiled the Father of the city. Every ward has one chief constable, and twelve others ; a night constable, and a proper number of watchmen under him ; so that the whole posse commitatus is numerous, and in general sufficient to keep the peace. There are for the several wards, watch and standard boxes. At the eastern end of Narrow Wine-street, stood Newgate, the city Gaol for debtors and malefactors, which being considered much too small, and in a confined situation, highly detrimental to the health of the prisoners, a new one is now built, of which we shall give the following information : \u2014 \u25a0 The BRISTOL GAOL is situated near Bathurst Basin, in Cumberland road, built on a sand rock ; the front being on the banks of the New River, or Avon, and the back near to the floating harbour. This is an extensive and commodious building, which, for health, convenience, and excellent arangement is not to be equalled in England, commanding extensive views of the surrounding country. It was begun in"], [106, "86 November, 1816 and completed in 1820. The archi tect was H. H. Seward, esq. of London ; built by Messrs. Jones and Wilcox, Bristol. The plan of the Gaol if as follows : \u2014 Entrance \u2014 Turnkey's lodge, containing a hall, bed room, bakehouse, bath, &c. store room, reception cells, and day room, over the same. On the top of this lodge is occasionally erected a drop, for the exe cution of condemned criminals. A court yard on each side of the lodge. A spacious court-yard leads to the Governor's house, which is situated in the centre. It contains a hall, governor's rooms, committee room ; bed rooms over the same, and a chapel covering the whole of the upper part, to which a communication is made from the four wings of the building by means of neat cast iron bridges in elevated situations. The wing on the left of the entrance, 126 feet six inches in length, and 34 feet six inches in breadth, containing, in front, apartments for nine female debt tors, first class, and eighteen female debtors, second class, with day rooms, and court-yard. The back of this wing contains apartments for ten male debtors first class, and fourteen male debtors second class, with day rooms and a court-yard. The wing to the right of the entrance, the same length and breadth as the former, containing apart ments for sixteen females on charge &c. wiih day rooms. Upper story, two cells and day room for females condemned for death, and infirmary for eight female patients, and two court-yards. The back os' this wing contains apartments for thirty three male debtors, common side, with day rooms, and a spa cious court-yard. The two back wings are for felons, being 93 feet 6 inches in length, each, and 34 feet 6 inches, each in breadth. That to the west, containing cells for seventeen males, with day rooms and court-yard. Infirmary on the upper story for nine patients. On the other side of this wing there are twenty one cells for males, on"], [107, "87 charge of felony, with day rooms and court-yard ; day room and four cells for king's evidence on upper etory. The other wing to the north, contains apartments for twenty one male felons, first class, with four cells for males condemned for death, in upper story, day rooms, &c. On the other side of this wing are cells for twenty-seven male felons, second class, with separate court-yards. Extent of the outer walls four acres, one rood. Length of the building from east to west 358 feet, containing in the whole, accommodation for 215 pri soners. The whole of the external walls of the wings, Governor's house and lodge, are built of hewn stone from Hanham quarries. The boundary wall (20 feet high) is built of hewn varigated marble from St. Vin cent's Rocks, wich has a beautiful appearance. The cells, apartments and passages are heated and ventilated by Pneumatic stoves (for which the builders have a Patent) fixed in the basement story. An excellent provision is made to supply the differ ent wings and governor's house with water, from an inexhaustible spring in a well nearly 100 feet deep, which is raised by means of a Tread wheel worked by the prisoners. The public will here perceive that the whole plan of this Prison is so admirably arranged, that although there are Ten different classes, yet they are all open to inspection, and can have no communication with each other, having party walls and iron palisading between the yards, admitting a free circulation of air. BRIDEWELL, the other city Prison, has two gates, and within them two opposite fronts of the building, which are for the confinement and correc tion of offenders. Those parts of the town not under the government of the magistrates of Bristol, and which are large and populous, both in the counties of Glocester and So merset, are governed as the out parts of London are, by justices of both counties ; who have constables, bailiffs, and criers, for the differed districts."], [108, "88 LAWFORDS GATE PRISON stands at the end of Glocester lane, without the city, near the place where Lawford's gate formerly stood; this prison is spacious and strongly built on tbe Howardian plan, for the suburbs of Bristol in Glocestershire. It has 70 separate cells, a chapel, and a hall for the justices in its front. The building extends about 150 feet, and the whole is surrounded with a strong wall 20 feet high. Here, and in another part of the suburbs, are held weekly courts, for the recovery of debts, com mittal of offenders, &c. The MERCHANT VENTURERS' SOCIETY was incorporated in this city by letters patent, of king Edward VI. in the sixth year of his reign ; and after wards confirmed by queen Elizabeth and king Charles I. They have lands to a considerable amount, for the support of alms-houses and other charitable uses ; a noble hall to meet in, and an alms-house adjoining for decayed seamen. This society consists of some of the principal merchants of Bristol and its environs, and has been honored with the names of nobility, and some of the Royal families. This respectable company generally act in conjunction with the Corporation for promoting the commerce and improvement of the city. The companies of this city were 25 ; the other 24, were as follow : Tailors, Weavers, Surgeons, Smiths, Hoopers, White-tawers, Dyers, Joiners, Wire-drawers, Cordwainers, Tanners, Butchers, Bakers, Innholders, Saddlers, Hatters, Turners, Pipe-makers, Carpenters, Halliers, Porters, Tilers, Masons, Tuckers. These companies had heretofore their halls, gowns, flags, and formalities ; now some of their trades are extinct. LIGHTING.\u2014 The act for lighting Bristol was pro cured about the latter part of the reign of king William III. This act obliged citizens to hang out their own lamps ; subsequently, public lamps were lighted for half the year only, but for many years had been lighted every night in the year with oil lamps. Bristol Coal Gas Company, incorporated by act of Parliament, which received the royal assent on the 21st. of March, 1819, the city lamps and many"], [109, "89 of the shops are lighted with this Gas. The works and offices are situated in Avon-street, St. Philip's. Bristol and Clifton Oil Gas Company, established by act of Parliament, the 4th of George IV. c. 102. This Gas is getting much into use in shops, private houses, and for lamps. Clifton is well lighted with lamps of this Gas. Their station is at Limekiln-road, leading to the Hotwells, and their offices are at 26 Clare-street. PAVING. \u2014 All the streets are well paved on each side, with flat stones for foot passengers, and have also smooth crossways from one side to another. A number of men are constantly employed in mending the streets and pavings, for which the citizens pay a regular tax, according to the rent of their houses. Some of the streets are Steined, according to Mr. Me Adam's plan. The streets are cleansed twice a week, according to act of parliament, and the foot-ways swept every morning. Regulations of Hackney Coaches and Chariots, within and for Ten miles round the city of Bristol : Number of Coaches, Thirty, Chariots Ten ; which are to be regularly on their Stands from Nine o'clock in the Morning until Eleven at night, and not to be absent more than one hour for feeding or refreshing, (except being called by a Fare) during the aforesaid time. The above number of Coaches and Chariots may stand and ply for hire at the following places : 2 in Wine-street 2 in Old Market-street 3 in St. James's-barton 3 in College-green 9 on St. Augustine's-back 1 on the Quay, near clare st 3 in St. Stephen's avenue 3 at the top of Temple-st. 3 in Queen-square 3 near Dowry-square 2 on Redcliff-hill 2 in Berkeley-square 1 in King-street 3 in Prince's-street The Fares at the various stands are set forth in a Book printed by authority of the Corporation, which Fares commence at the Stand from which the Coach may leave. N"], [110, "90 That the Fares to be taken either by time or dis tance, at and after the rates and proportions follow ing, the driver driving not less than at the rate of four miles an hour, if so required : viz. for One Hour, Two Shillings; for any time not exceeding Fifteen Minutes from the end of the First hour. Sixpence. The Driver has his option to charge for time or distance. THE ARMS OF BRISTOL are a ship and castle, and the motto, Virtute et Industria. Long may these qualities of virtue and industry be exhibited, and the characterestics merited by the inhabitants of Bristol ! The practice of Virtue and Industry are the surest methods of acquiring wealth and honor. May the names of Bristol merchant or trader be ever respected for strict justice, and liberal and extensive benevo nce. This motto reminds me of a passage in Seneca's Epistles, a salutary document and memento to every reader, \" Itur ad astra, frugalitate, temperantia, forti tudine, aliisque virtutibus.\" By frugality, temperance, fortitude, and the other virtues, we ascend to heaven! Well might the philosopher reccommend the virtue of Temperance ; it introduces to evsery other human excellence ; frugality, regularity, fortitude, and indus try ; as thus : superfluous indulgences are expensive, and sooner or later produces poverty and necessity. The little that nature wants, costs but little, and will admit of some saving, even in low circumstances; and to be saving is to be thriving and rising in the world. Therefore temperance implies and introduces frugality. Intemperance leads to irregularity; and none but the temperate, are, or can be, strictly regu lar, according to the laws of nature. Intemperance debilitates the faculties of body and mind, and dimi nishes the power of exertion, fortitude, intrepidity in duty, and untired industry. But the temperate man will not feel in himself those deplorable obstacles to activity, but will be always ready to do every good work: for (as some author observes) \"to be ever active in laudable pursuites, is the distinguishing characteristic of a man of merit.\""], [111, "CHAP. IX. Trade and Commerce of Bristol, Foreign and Domestic; its Ships, and various Manufactories. THE inhabitants of Bristol were very early addict ed to trade and manufactures. Several ancient au thors represent Bristol as \" the most famous place of commerce in England next to London, frequented by merchants of many nations.\" It took early to the Newfoundland cod fishing, and had trade to Andalu sia in Spain, and many other foreign parts. By the charter of Edward III. it appears that it was so con siderable as to obtain the reputation of being the second city in England for trade and populousness ; and was of so much importance as to be constituted a county within itself. This king established the manufactory of cloth at Bristol, where it flourished for a long series of years to the middle of the present century, but is now entirely declined, and removed to other parts where labour is cheaper. Bristol has been anciently and frequently celebrated by the writers of our own and other countries. Busching wrote that \"this city for its prudent regulations is perhaps out-done by none, and for its vast commerce, wealth, and shipping, by very few trading cities in Europe.\" And Dr. Campbell, \" as to foreign commerce, if we view it in gross, Bristol is next to London ; but if the value of that commerce be compared with the size of the respective cities, Bristol may be equal, and ex cept in a few branches, to the participation of which, of late, she begins to put in her claim, in point of. intercourse with all parts of the world, her correspond ence is nearly as extensive.\" Such are the accounts of it, by a Foreigner, and by a Briton."], [112, "92 Among the ships of Cannings we find one of 900 and one of 500 tons. Tbe letters patent granted by Henry VII. 1415, to John Cabot, for making disco veries in America, prove that Bristolians were some of the first adventurers to the West Indies, in the trade to which only, they, at this time, employ up wards of seventy large ships. The merchants of Bristol trade with a more entire independence on London than any other port in Britain. Whatever exportation they make to any part of the world, they can bring back the full returns to their own port, and are able to dispose of them here, without shipping any part for London, or consigning the vessels thither to dispose of their cargoes, which the merchants of other ports are obliged to do : they have buyers at home for their largest importations ; and consequently the shopkeepers of Bristol (many of whom are whole sale dealers) keep up a great inland trade, and have riders, as the Londoners, to all the western counties, and principal places from Southampton to the banks of the Trent in the north. And as well by sea, as by the navigation of the rivers Severn and Wye, by Trows, they have the trade of South and part of North Wales to themselves, also of the English counties bordering on these rivers and on the Bristol channel. Their trade to Ireland is much increased, many ships being con stantly employed to various ports of that kingdom, from which they import linen, woollen, and bay yarn, salt butter, bacon, pigs, cattle, &c. Their foreign trade is principally to the West Indies, for sugar, rum, coffee, &c. STEAM PACKETS to Dublin, Cork, and Water ford, sail every week during the Summer months, from Cumberland Basin; also War-office and Govern ment Packets sail from Bristol to the above places regularly: agent Mr. R. Smart, No. 1, Quay, oppo site the Drawbridge. Steam Packets to Chepstow, Newport, Ilfracombe, Swansea, Tenby, &c. : agents J. and W. Jones, Rownham, Hotwells, and St. Ste phen's avenue, Bristol. Besides the foreign trade there is scarsely any kind"], [113, "93 of business or manufactory but what is carried on in a greater or less degree in this city. In the shops are seen as capital exhibitions, and as great a variety of all sorts of goods, as are to be met with in the kingdom, and are rendered at reasonable rates. The shopkeepers are active, industrious, upright, and obliging. The plentiful supply of coals is a great advantage to the manufacturers who carry on large works in Bristol, and its vicinity ; we shall therefore name a few of them : BRASS WORKS, at Baptist mills, on the river Froom, but a little way from the eastern suburb of Bristol, is the first place in which Brass wras made in England. The original workmen were brought over from Holland. The great quantity made here is either drawn into wire, or formed into what is termed bat tery, for the export or home trade, and is also sent to London, Liverpool, and other parts of the kingdom. It is carried on under the firm of Harford's and Bristol Brass Battery and Wire company. Their wire works are at Keynsham : they have also Spelter works at Warmley ; their counting and warehouses, are at 18, Corn street. There are also Works at Crew's Hole, St. George's, near Bristol, for the making of Spelter and Brass, carried on by Messrs. Arnold and Matthews. Copper, Spelter, Zinc, Brass battery, Sheet Brass and Wire Works. \u2014 About two miles from Bristol, near Hanham, on the bank of the Avon, and atSoundwell, near Mangotsfield, are the works of Christopher Pope and Co. (offices, cheese lane, st Philip's) for preparing these metals. Here is produced some of the purest Zinc in the world. Its fine and excellent contexture and malleablity, cause a great demand for it among the curious artificers at Birmingham and other places, and considerable quantities of it are exported. Dr. Watson, in the fourth volume of his Chemical Essays, expresses thus. \" the Zinc made here is whiter and brighter than any other, either English or Foreign.\" They have a patent for making malleable Zinc, for"], [114, "94 covering buildings, &c. This company also manufac ture Iron Wire, Hoops and Sheets, with a powerful steam engine, in cheese lane. Patent Shot and Lead Works. \u2014 The Small Shot cast at Bristol is preferred abroad to any other, on account of its rotundity. The patent shot, which is superior to any other kind, and so much esteemed, was invent ed by the late Mr. William Watts, Plumber of this city, who erected a tower here for its manufacture, and obtained a patent for his discovery. It is still manufactured on Redcliff hill, by Mr. Christopher George, where he also manufactures lead into milled and cast sheets and patent lead pipes. ln St. Philip's, (J. S. Riddle, and Co.) and on the road to Easton, (R. Bayly and Co.) are two consi derable Lead Works, where lead is smelted from the ore, and rolled, or cast into sheets ; also for prepar ing White lead. The Iron Foundries of Bristol are considerable, where all kinds of castings are made for machinery, &c. ; and at the principal one, belonging to Messrs. John Winwood and Co. Cheese lane, St. Philip's, where Steam Engines are likewise prepared, Canon are cast of all sizes, which are bored by means of a steam engine. A patent was granted to John Garnett, esq. late of this city, for his Invention to lessen Friction in all kinds of wheels, blocks for ships, grind-stones and rollers ; this is of imporance to all connected in mill work, where great powers are required ; for by its use, a far less force answers every purpose, the move ments being rendered more easy, the works of course last longer, and seldom want repairs. The present firm is S. Dobbins, and Co. Patent Wheel and Block manufacturers, Brass fy Iron Founders, College street, where Sugar-mills, are made, and all kinds of articles in the above branches for the West Indies. Distillery \u2014 There is one large Distillery for spirits, Thomas Castle and Co. in St. Philip's, and several Rectifying houses, which are in high estimation, and supply the whole city."], [115, "95 The Breweries of Bristol are numerous and exten sive, and their malt liquors are stronger and finer than in many other cities. Most of the Publicans have the advantage of Brewing their own Beer : Ion,\" lists may be referred to in the Commercial List of the Bristol Directory. Sugar Houses \u2014 There are ten large Sugar-Houses in Bristol, where sugars are manufactured in the usual way, and in three or four of them by the patent method. Coals being much cheaper than in London, loaf sugar is made here, and sold on better terms than it can be any where else. The single-refined sugars of Bris tol are more esteemed, and will get a higher price abroad than those of other places. Soap Manufacture. \u2014 Postlethwaite, in his Diction ary of Trade and Commerce, informs us. that \" the first manufacture of soap in England was in Bristol. In 1523 it supplied London with the best grey speckled soap, and with white also.\" The Bristol soap is of very superior quality, and great quantities of it is sent to London, and other parts of the kingdom. Glass Manufactories. \u2014 Among the various manufac tories which exist in this opulent and extensive city, none appear to us more curious, or more deserving inspection, than the different glass manufactories. The Bristol glass of every description, has been generally considered as the best manufactured in the kingdom. This appears to be sufficiently ascertained by a comparison of the article in a foreign market. The principal export trade is to America, Spain and Portugal, and to the East and West Indies. To America in particular, flint glass has been sent from different parts of the continent of Europe, which, on comparison with the Bristol glass, has been found to be deficient in point of colour, as well as in its spe cific gravity. The following are the firms : \u2014 Flint Glass House, Messrs Henry Ricketts and Co. Temple-gate, and Black Bottle House, (Patentees) Avon-street, St. Philip's. Black Bottle Houses, Messrs. Cooksons and Pow ells, Avon-street, St. Philip's, and Messrs. John"], [116, "96 Nicholas and Co. Limekiln dock. Messrs. Lucas, Coathupe and Homers, Crown Glass Manufacturers, Nailsea, ; offices and warehouses, Nicholas street. Those of our readers who are curiously inclined, would be highly gratified with a visit to Messrs. Ricketts, and Co. Temple gate, where strangers are permitted to view the Flint Glass works, by giving a small gratuity to the workmen. Floor Cloth Manufactory. \u2014 One of the first attrac tions to Strangers visiting the city is, The Floor Cloth Manufactory. The superior style in which this article is here produced by Messrs. John Hare and Sons, has called forth the warmest admiration from the nume rous distinguished Foreigners who have visited the concern, and is particularly noticed in the Travels of Nemnich, and Dr. J. H. Spiker, Librarian to the King of Prussia. The whole process of this manufacture is conducted on the premises, from spinning the Flax, weaving, &c. with the manufacture of Colors, to the completion in pieces, 180 feet long and 27 wide, of the most rich and varied patterns ; which are exported to all parts of the world : mauufactory Temple gate. Bristol Pottery. \u2014 The earthen-ware manufactory, under the name of the Bristol Pottery, is on Temple Back ; it is carried on by Messrs. Pountney and Allies, has been established several years, and is now on a large and extensive scale, giving employ to about 200 men, women, and children. The articles they produce are similar to those of Mr. Wedgwood's, and the other superior potteries of Staffordshire, and con stitute, in addition to the home trade, a considerable article of export to all the foreign markets. They grind their materials by the means of a large and powerful steam-engine, and the various processes of forming the ware, of the glazing, of the printing, the painting, the enamelling, &c. are peculiarly curious and interesting. Admission may be had by applica tion to the proprietors at the counting-house on the premises."], [117, "CHAP. X Buildings of Bristol in general, the principal ancient and modern Streets, the Squares, open Places, and Conveniencies for ambulatory Exercilations. BARRETT observes, that the whole city is well built, considering that it has never yet been burned down and rebuilt, or ever suffered much by fires. Guthrie, in his Geographical Grammar, asserts, that \" Bristol is not a well-built city.\" Perhaps Barrett might be too partial to the town, and Guthrie not well enough acquainted with all parts of it to judge. The truth is, that the internal and most ancient parts of Bristol have a much better appearance than most other old cities and towns, as great sums have been ex pended in rebuilding and newly fronting them. But still we can see something of Bristol as in its ancient state, so distant as about two, three, or more centuries ago. The great house on St. Augustine's Back, now Colston's School ; a spacious old mansion in Small street (which perhaps received king Charles 1.) with a large bow-window; the north-east corner of High street ; some houses in Baldwin and Maryport-streets, the Pithay, Lewin's-mead, on the Broad- wear, Tem ple-street, and other places, may help us to ideas of what the city was in former times. To give a proper description of this place \u2014 \" It is an ancient town surrounded by a modern, and is partly well, and partly ill built. The antique and internal parts of the town are very irregular, consisting of ancient houses of wood and plaster, and sharp tops, and some with three or four projecting stories, with an intermixture of old fronts modernized ; some good houses of brick Q"], [118, "98 and a few of stone with level tops and cornices, some higher, some lower, altogether composing, remark able, and in several places, not unpleasing masses of irregularity. Though some of the most ancient streets have of late years been widened and improved, and several new streets totally, handsomely, and uniformly built, viz. \u2014 Bridge-street, all of stone, the houses four stories high, and elegantly finished : Clare-street, Union, and Bath-streets, of brick, orna mented with stone, with several others. Bristol has done much in improving an old town, and as the desirable blessing of peace has been granted to us, will undoubtedly do more. The modern and exter nal parts of Bristol are more regularly, handsomely, or elegantly built of brick and stone, and all other buildings are prohibited by act of parliment. Tbe most spacious of the old streets, are, the Old Market street, West-street, Castle-street, Peter street, Broadmead, part of Wine-street, High-street, St. Augustine's-back, the Broad-quay, King-street, St. Michael's hill; and over the bridge, Temple and Thomas streets, and Redcliff hill. The most regular beautiful or elegant streets of the external and modern parts are, Park-street, Great George's and Charlotte streets, built mostly of freestone. College-street and Trinity-street of brick; Unity and Orchard-streets and Princes-street, the most spacious of all, each of stone and brick ; and in St. James's and St. Paul's, Stoke's-croft, St. James's-barton, Cumberland-street, with too great a number of others to mention, that are decently and handsomely constructed. These con tain many large, or convenient houses for genteel families, let at moderate rents, and with the other conveniences peculiar to Bristol, such as coals,whole some air, and water, plenty and cheapness of Provi sions, attract families to settle here, and to occupy the new houses that are always erecting. The squares in various parts of the town are nine : I. HOPE SQUARE, a small place at the western part of the town, so called from Lady Hope, who founded a Chapel, which stands on the eastern side"], [119, "99 of it. This is built on a declivity, has two other sides of brick houses, and the fourth irregular. II. Dowry Square, a little to the east of the other. This is handsomely built of brick; and has a neat garden or plantation with a walk around it inclosed with rails. III. Berkeley Square stands on a gentle slope, on the north-east side of Brandon-hill. This square is elegantly built of freestone. The houses are on three sides only, the south-east side is left open, near to which a new street (Charlotte) being since placed it has the appearance of a fourth side from the upper part of the square. The spacious area of this ele vated, pleasant, and beautiful pile, is inclosed from the coach-ways by a dwaft wall and iron palisades. The upper stories of these houses command a view of great part of the city ; and agreeable objects, villas, houses, and cottages among tbe trees, in the adjacent country; and, in a clear day, Devonshire-place, near Holloway, Bath, which may be seen also on B andon hill, Durdham-down, Kingsdown, and several other neighbouring hills, and are the only buildings con nected with Bath that are visible at Bristol. The upper parts of Bath can be viewed from Herridge common, below Dundry, three miles from Bristol; and on Dundry-hill and tower. IV. Queen Square, the largest in Bristol, and in England, (except Lincoln's-inn, in London,) in cluding seven acres and a quarter. The houses are all handsomely and uniformly built, chiefly of brick, with a few of stone. It has eight avenues, one at each corner and one in the middle of each side. There are courts before the houses, and smooth foot ways and a carriage-way between the courts and the area, which is inclosed with rails, and has on each side a spacions gravel-walk, bordered with elms. There are gravel- walks from each avenue that lead to the centre, in which, upon a high pedestal of Port land stone, surrounded with iron rails and lamps,* is a curious equestrian statue of king William III. cast of copper, nnd done by Kysbrack. The whole square"], [120, "100 has a magnificent appearance ; the walks and grass being rolled and kept in tbe neatest order, by an offi cer, who has an annual salary. Here are the Custom house, Mansion-house, and Excise-office. V. Kino Square, to the north of St. James's, is on a gentle slope at the bottom of Kingsdown-hill, the ascent to which from the square is very steep, yet covered w ith houses up to and beyond the summit. The houses are uniformly built of brick ornamented with stone; the whole area surrounded by rails and lime trees ; the wralks neatly gravelled, the square clean, wholesome, and pleasant, and well lighted with lamps. VI. Brunswick Square, in St. Paul's parish is built of brick ornamented with stone. The eastern side is an elegant pile. The area is inclosed with rails and trees. VII. St. James's Square, is well built of brick; its houses are large and good ; it is neatly paved all over with stone. VIII. Portland Square, so named in honor of the Duke of Portland, the late High Steward of Bris tol. This is a handsome square, the houses are all fronted with freestone. The northern and southern sides are elevated by attic stories at the centre and corner houses ; the other sides at the corner houses only. In the centre of the eastern side, stand a beautiful church and steeple in modern gothic, dedi cated to St. Paul. In the middle of the square is a circular grass-plat and shubbery, inclosed with iron palisades. This is the most regular and elegant square in Bristol. IX. Somerset Square, the only one on the south side of Bristol-bridge; at Redcliff, not far from the church. This is a retired situation, neatly built of brick, the area is a garden, inclosed by a dwaft wall, with walks for the inhabitants. It has a pleasing opening and prospect into Somersetshire, of a ver dant valley, (between which the new river flows) terminating in Dundry hill and tower. There are several other places in Bristol, that are"], [121, "101 not named squares, the principal of which is th\u00ab COLLEGE GREEN: this is on a fine elevation; its plan is nearly triangular ; on the south side are the Cathedral, St. Augustine's church, and the fine old Gate of the Monastery ; on the north side St. Mark's Church, commonly called the Mayor's chapel. There are some very good modern houses of stone and brick, and a spacious way for carriages on each 6ide. The green is inclosed with wood rails, within which a gravel-walk shaded with lime trees, bounds the whole area. This Green has undergone great improvement ; the walks newly gravelled, and the whole of the centre encompassed with iron rails, also the two walks between. The one is from east to west, and the other across it from north to south, leads to the door of the cathedral. This on all accounts, is the pleasantest, and next after Queen-square, the most spacious place in Bristol, The grass is kept in good order, and the walks are lighted with lamps by night. There are some other open places not squares, such as the Mall, at Clifton, Dowry-parade, the Lower Green, St. Augustine's Place, St. James's spacious Church-yard, and St. James's Barton, in which are many decent buildings and genteel inhabitants. There are public parades and convenient and agree able places to walk on, for the inhabitants, in most parts of the town. For the western parts, and the no bility and gentry, there are the colonade or crescent, and the gravel walk, shaded with trees, by the river, one for rainy and the other for fair weather ; the paved paratle near Dowry-square, the Royal York Crescent, Richmond Terrace, and the Mall. In the city there are the Gravel-walk on Brandon hill, the walks in College-green, and the noble walks in Queen-square, the parade in St: James's church yard ; another on Kingsdown, and the walks in King's and Brunswick-squares, all of which are open to the public. For the inhabitants south of Bristol-bridge there are the wralks in Redcliff church-yard ; and also Redcliff-parade, which stands' on a; lofty elevation"], [122, "102 above the river, has an iron palisade (with lamps) the whole length of the edge of this beautiful terrace ; and from whence there is a pleasant prospect of tbe city, harbour, and shipping. Having briefly treated of that large mass of build ings and appendages, named Bristol, which cover above 1600 acres of ground, and which are the prin cipal with respect to extent, let us now attend to the public buildings, devoted to particular purposes. And it will be highly proper to begin with those that are dedicated to the use of the worshippers of that DEITY who has ever been an awful object to consi derate persons, and to mankind in general, the eternal, invisible, and infinitely great and gracious Creator, and the God of all nations, the only righteous and proper Object of Our supreme veneration ; who is too wise and good to be partial to the people of particular countries, complexions and professioss ; and who (we have every reason to conclude) will graciously accept the adoration, gratitude and obedience, sincerely intended for HIM, to whatever erroneous names, numbers, firm, or form it may be offered, and from the good and well-meaning of whatever national profession, sect, party, or denomination. As London has two great churches, St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey; and as Dublin has two, Christ church and St. Patrick's ; Bristol has also two prin cipal Churches, the Cathedral and the Church of St. Mary, at Redcliff, which as they are eminent above the others, are venerably conspicuous from the sur- Tounding hills and country."], [123, "CHAP.

THIS Cathedral Church was originally the Abbey Church of the Monastery of St. Augustine, which was founded by Robert Fitzharding, son of Harding, a younger son of the King of Denmark. Robert of Glocester, the old monkish poet, gives some account of Harding. \"A burgeys of Bristow, tho' Robert HardyDp, For grete tresour and richesse so well was wyth the Kynj, That he yaft him and his heires the noble barony That so rych is of Berkeley, with all the seignorie; And thulk Robert Hardyng arered suth, I wyss An Abbey at Bristow of St. Aastyn that is.\""], [124, "104 EXTRACT from an ancient MS. **Raufe Renaulde toe Johnne a Dannburie. \" Onn the Mynster. \u25a0 Inhanted han I ben to feste mie eyene, Wylh geason workes, so per'd theie to my mynde, Botte nhann I sawe the Measondue so syne, Bie yt, ilk othyr was atlenes y-wrin'd. \" Good DanhSuhie, moste sothlie doe I sayne, Austyn's ihe flowret of the roode y-blest ; Rennome wyl Bristowe han fro yt alleyne, Allbytte her grete dedes be from her rhestte ! \" Sykyr Fitzhardeynoe was a hallie wyglite; Soche tendementes wyll fynde to lieav'n a waie, Soe seemlie pyle y-buyl'd, joieowes to syghte, Wher charytie sheens bryghte her cheerynge raiej \" Wher the pale sinner swythen hath releece; Y-wher relygion's tapyr castelhe rounde On all a heav'nile soothing dolcie peece; Tys there yatte sellynesse can be bie mortal les found 1\" Robert Fitzharding was made lord of Berkeley by king Henry II. who patronized, and contributed towards this foundation. The ancient and superb gate and gate house of the monastery are still remain ing, though the height of the arch is lessened by the rise of the ground in so many hundred years. The gate is of Saxon architecture, in use\" before the Gothic with pointed arches was become universal, and is of most curious workmanship : the scrolls, twists, and other ornaments, are so interwoven and intricate, that it is difficult to trace them out. This Gate, with its ancient inscription, the old Cathedral Church, the Cloisters, Chapter-House, and remains of the monastery about the Lower Green, are worthy the attention of the antiquarian, architect, and conni seur. The inscription over the gate, in one line of old English letters, is literally as follows :\u2014 Rex Henricus seciidus et dus Robertus fili' Her dyngi filn regis daci\u00e6 huj' monasterii primi ffundatores exiterunt. That is : king Henry II. and lord Robert, son of Herdyng, son of the king of Denmark, were"], [125, "105 the first founders of this monastery. \u2014 ln 1141, Simon, bishop of Worcester ; Robert, bishop of Exeter ; Geoffrey, bishop of Landaff, and Gilbert, bishop of St. Asaph, dedicated the church to St. Augustine. Robert Fitzharding- died a canon of his own monastery, his wife Eva, also' died the prioress of some religious house in Bristol. This Robert was in great friendship with Robert, earl of Glocester, and most heartily espoused the cause of the empress Maud, and her son Henry II. Henry being bred up at Bristol, became intimately acquainted with Fitz harding. The regard imbibed for each other in their school-boy days, continued to increase with their years ; and as Fitzharding strenuously exerted him self in behalf of his royal friend ; so Henry when he came to the crown distinguished Fitzharding by the most honourable testimonies of his friendship and respect. A monument is erected to the memory of Robert Fitzharding, under an arch in the Lady-Chapel, a little to the east of the door; a well-ornamented tomb, sustaining two sculptures of stone, of the Founder, in armour, and his wife Eva, recumbent, and as large as life: this is inclosed with iron rails, and near to the tomb is the following inscription on marble : \u2014 \"The monument of Robert Fitzharding, lord of Berkeley, decsended from the kings of Denmark; and Eva his wife, by whom he had five sons and two daugh ters : Maurice, his eldest son, was the first of the family that took the name of Berkeley : this Robert Fitzharding laid the foundation of this church and monastery of St, Augustine, in the year 1 140, tbe fifth of king Stephen, dedicated and endowed it in 1 148. He died in the year 1170, in the 17th of king Henry II. This monument was repaired A.D. 1742. \" From the said Robert Fitzharding, lord of Berkeley, Augustus, the earl, is the two and twentieth iridescent.\" From the dedication of this monastery to its dissolu tion, 1539, it had 25 abbots, some of whom were free and licentious livers, and did not keep up the stric tures of their profession. At the visitation, prior to P"], [126, "106 the dissolution, Guilliam Morgan, it is said, the last of them, was found to have a little snug ecclesiasticnl seraglio of six ladies, stiled by Fuller and Speed \" lewd women.\" At the dissolution of monasteries by king Henry YI11. this noble church, then about 350 feet in length, was party demolished, and part just preserved from the fate of other venerable structures, the ornament and boast of the country, The destruction of those buildings was inexpressibly absurd. If the lives and manners of their inhabitants were depraved and noxi ous, the stones and buildings were innoxious, and might have been rendered useful as temples for divine worship, hospitals, schools, and work-houses. The rapacity of the reforming commissioners of those times was such, that for the sake of the lead on the roof, they eagerly set to work on it, and after they had stripped it off, proceeded to destroy the structure itself. But king Henry, to palliate his cacrilege, and make a shew of refunding, having determined to establish six new bishoprics, of which Bristol was one, and having been informed that there was enough of the fabrick left standing fora cathedral, by express order, put a stop to its further demolition, and the western part being taken away, it was walled up, and repaired. The revenue of this monastery, amounted to \u00a3707 15s. 3d. which he settled on the bishop, dean, and chapter. He annexed the whole county of Dorset to this diocese ; which, with the city of Bristol, and some environs in Glocestershire, containing in all 248 parishes, limit the jurisdiction of the bishop of Bristol. King Henry commanded the church to be from thenceforth denominated, the cathedral of the holy and undivided Trinity of the city of Bristol : and in the year 1542 appointed Paul Bush, an Augustine Friar of Oxford, canon of Salisbury and one of the king's chaplains, the first bishop of this see ; who is said to have had great skill in physic, and wrote a treatise on salves and curative remedies. In an old quarto book, in black letter, without title, date, or name of its author, I find this account of him :\u2014 \" Paul"], [127, "107 Bush, provincial of the Bonhommes, a man well learned both in divinity and physic, as his works yet extant may\" testify, written some in prose, and some in verse. In the beginning of queen Mary's reign he was deprived for being married ; and died unhappily a few days before her.\" He has a monument near the eastern end of the northern aisle, with a sculpture of a skeleton on his tomb, whicli has this inscription : \" Hie jacet Dominus Palus Bush, primus hujus ecclesi\u00e6 episcopus, qui obitt 1 1 die Octobris anno dominii 1558, \u00e6tatis su\u0153 68, cojus anim\u00e6 proprietur Christus.\" Here lies Paul Bush, the first bishop of this church, who died the 11th day of October, in the year of our Lord 1558, aged 68: on whose soul Christ have mercy ! It would be needless to present our readers with merely the names of the bishops, and instead of such a list, we shall give a few brief particulars of the most noted. John Holyman, 1553, was a zealous Roman Catholic preacher, and writer against Lu therans. Richard Fletcher, 1583, attended Mary, queen of Scots, on the scaffold, and killed himself by immoderately chewing or smoaking tobacco. Robert Wright, 1722, had the stone pulpit made, and the opposite seats for the corporation. Thomas West field, 1641, was deprived by the Parliament ; wrote his own epitaph, and in it styled himself \" the mean est of bishops, and the chief of sinners.\" Thomas: Howell, 1644 ; the army turned his palace into a malt house, and himself out of doors. John Lake, 1684, was one of the seven bishops committed to tbe tower by James II. Jonathan Trelawney, 1685, corres ponded with William, prince of Orange, and was a friend to the revolution. Thomas Seeker, 1734, was an author of several sermons and tracts. But the two principal literary, scientific, and useful characters on the lists are, first, Dr. John Butler, whose Sermons and Divine Analogy are monuments of his learning and good intellectual abilities. He was very gene rous, annually expended more than he received from the whole see ; repaired the palace ; in the year 1750"], [128, "108 proposed to the corporation the building a new church at Kingswood for instruction of the colliers, and gave \u00a3400 towards it. The second is, Dr. Thomas New ton, 1761 to 1782. This gentleman was a good prac tical preacher, and a friend to literature and literary men. He published a commetary on Milton's Paradise Lost and Regained, which has gone through eight or nine editions. His life of Milton is a very curious, impartial piece of biography. He published Desser tations on the Prophesies, in three volumns, octavo, and several other tracts and sermons. The Bishop (1825) is The Right Rev. Dr. John Kaye, Master of Christ college, Oxford, and Regius Professor of Divinity in the University of Cambridge. The present cathedral consists of the spacious cross of the old church, the tower on the middle of it, and all the rest of the church eastward. On the outside of the church are observable the strength and dimen sions of the abutments, which project ten or twelve feet from the walls ; and also the tower which is square, large, not plain, but well ornamented, crowned with battlemeuts and four pinnacles ; and is a considerable object in and about the city, particularly from the west, at Clifton, Ashton, Bedminster, and from Mardyke, in the street leading to the Hotwell. There are eight steps from the door down to the church pavement. To be convinced of the greatness of the tower the stranger needs only to stand under it and observe the dimensions of the arches which support it. This church is in length from east to west 175 feet, the breadth of the cross from north to south 128 feet, the breadth of the body and aisles, 73 feet, and the heigth of the lower 140 feet. A little to the west of the church, is still visible, at the lower part of a summer-house, at a projecting corner, part of tbe abutment of tbe western end of the northern aisle of the church ; which plainly shews how far that aisle extended before its demolition. The roof of the church is all beautifully arched with stone, and of different patterns, and has these peculiarities, that the heigth of the nave and aisles are"], [129, "109 equal ; and that the roofs of the two aisles are incom parably curious, (arches supporting arches,) and deserving the attention of those who have a taste for architecture. In the body of the church are, a haudsome pulpit of stone, ornamented with the arms of the king; prince of Wales ; bishopric ; city ; berkeley family ; and of bishop Wright, who erected and gave it to the church ; and also the seats and pews about it, for the bishop, clergy, mayor, corporation, and audience ; the screen that is before the choir has a beautiful Gothic gate-way, with the arms of king Henry VIII. and prince Edward over it ; the paintings of twelve minor prophets in pannelled niches. This supports a noble and excellent organ, in a superb and capital case, with the best front to the body of the church. There is also a small organ which fronts to the choir, beneath the other. The pipes of both the organs are not gilded, but shew their naked and dull tin ; though most of the parish organs shine with golden lustre. The choir is neat and small, in the Gothic taste ; and has proper seats for the bishop, arch-deacon, dean, sub-dean, chancellor, six prebendaries, a pr\u00e6-centor, and four minor canons. The steps that lead to, and the platform of the altar, are paved with black and white marble. At the altar is a painting of a triangle, surrounded by cherubs, done by Vansomers. The window to the east of the nave, and the four other windows of the chancel, are of painted glass, and the two windows at the end of the aisles are of enamelled glass, representing various scenes of scriptural history. At the end of the north aisle, is discovered the re mains of an altar, of curious workmanship, and from its present appearance must have been in earlier times very handsome. This church has many gothic beauties and npwards of 100 monuments, both anci ent modern, some very handsome, and all well exe cuted, which have a grand and pleasing effect. There are several recumbent sculptures of stone, of full human dimensions, in various parts of the church, viz. of three mitred abbots in the chancel, four of"], [130, "110 the Berkeley family, including the founder and his wife ; of Sir Charles Vaughan in the northern aisle ; and three fine figures of the Newtons of Bans-court. On the western side of the church, near to the north door, is an elegant highly finished monument to Mrs. Draper, the celebrated Eliza ot' Sterne. It is in the form of a Gothic arch of Sienna marble, on which are two beautiful figures of white marble, in alto relievo, standing on each side of a pedestal, which supports an urn, with a wreath of Mowers hang ing down. Tbe figure on the right, which represents Genius, has her left hand on her breast; and in her right, the Trumpet of Fame, with a flame issuing out of it. The other figure represents Benevolence, con templating a nest in her left hand, in which a pelican is nourishing her young with her blood. Her right hand points to the inscription, on the pedestal, thus: \" Sacred to the Memory of Mrs. Elizabeth Draper, in whom genius and benevolence were united.\" Further in on the same side is a monument \" Sacred to the Menory of Mrs. Eleanor Daniel, who was born in Barbadoes, Nov. 22, 1737 ; and died at Bristol, the 15th June, 1774. Far from her native home lies buried here All that a Parent's fondness could desire ; All that a tender husband held most dear, All lhat the wants of childhood could require. Such was her earthly and domestic fame; But brighter Virtues glow'd within her mind ; She, during life, pursued a glorious aim, In sickness patient, and in death reiign'd. On the same monument is a tablet, \" To the me mory of Thomas Daniel, Esq. late Merchant of this city, died 23d Feb. 1802. Near to the western door, on this side, is a new pyramidal monument, containing at the base, a beau tiful female figure contemplating the sensitive plant ; on an urn above is the following inscription ; \" In Memory of Catherine, Wife of John Vernon,"], [131, "111 junr. of Lincoln's Inn, who died June 3, 1794, aged 19 years.\" And underneath. \" Formed by nature to attract admiration, and to in vite Respect ; lovely in her Person, graceful in her Manners, amiable in her disposition ; happy to re ceive Pleasure, and more happy to impart it. Every one was conscious of her Merits but herself. The Disease to which she fell a victim, added lustre to the Virtues of her Mind, and the submissive Piety which prepared her way to Heaven taught the Duty of resignation to her afflicted Husbaud.\" N. B. This, and Mrs. Draper's Monument, were the operations of that exquisitely meritorious Sculp tor, Bacon, of London. On the western side, near the entrance into the Cloisters, is an elegant monument, \" Sacred to the memory of Mr. George Robinson, (Eldest son of George Robinson, Esq. of Knapton Grove, in the county of Norfolk) a young man of pro mising acquirements and unaffected suavity of man ners, whose remains are interred near this spot. His afflicted relatives and friends were suddenly deprived ofhim on the 5th day of August, 1820, in the 23d year of his age, by the upsetting of a small Boat, whilst cross ing the'Channel from the island of the Flat Holmes (to Uphill, Somersetshire,) where he was superintending the improvement of the Light-house, under the direction of the Honorable Corporation of the Trinity house, London ; this Monument is inscribed by his affection ate and disconsolate Parents.\" On a marble tablet, in Bass-relief, above the inscription, is represented, the Boat tossing in the foaming billows of the sea, and at a little distance is tbe Light-house. This is well executed by Messrs. Tyley and Son, of Bristol. Over the entrance to the Cloisters, on the west side is, a neat monument to the memory of Mr. John Weeks, many years keeper of the Bush Inn, in this city, who died 18th of June, 1819, aged 74. A bust representing a good likeness, is above the inscription."], [132, "112 Near the above is a monument to the memory of Mr. Roger Watts, of this city, Wine merchant ; an excellent character ; his likeness in a bust, is on an oval, above the inscription. In the southern corner is an elegant monument representing a pedestal, and two profiles in relief, with the following inscription : \" Emm\u00e6 Craufuird, Uxori Ebeu ! Quam desiderata? sac. esseVol. Gualtherus Kennedy Craufuird, Suus.\" In the northen aisle, without the rails, is a marble monument, \" Sacred to the memory of Elizabeth, the wife of Samuel Moody, of London, Esq. who died at the Hotwells, Dec. 23, 1782, aged 26. 41 Fair was her form, more fair her gentle mind, Where Virtue, Sense, and Piety combin'd .

William Mason: \" Mary, the daughter of William Sherman, of King ston-upon-Hull, Esq. and Wife of the Rev. William Mason, died March 27, 1767, aged 28. \" Take holy Earth all that my Soul holds dear; Take that best Gift which Heav'n so lately gave: To Bristol's fount I bore with trembling care Her faded form, \u2014 she bow'd to taste the wave And died.

Bid them be chaste, be innocent, like thee. Bid them in duty's sphere as meekly move : And if so fair, from vanity as free, As firm in friendship, and as fond in love- Tell them, tho' 'tis an awful thing to die, (Twas ev'n to thee) yet the dread path once trod, Heav'n lifts its everlasting portals high, Aud bids the pure iu heart behold their God.\""], [133, "113 Nearly opposite Mrs. Mason's is a lofty monument to the memory of Mr. William Powell, an excellent Actor in Tragedy and Comedy, who built the Theatre Royal in King street, and died at Bristol. On a pyramidical table is a bass-relief of the deceased, and the following inscription : \" William Powell, esq. one of the patentees of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, died the 3d of July, 1769, aged 33 years. His Widow caused this Monu ment to be erected, as well to perpetuate his memory, as her own irretrievable loss of the best of Husbands, Fathers, and Friends. \" Bristol ! to worth and genious ever just, To the our Powtll's dear remains we trust: Soft as the streams thy sacred springs impart, The milk of human kindness warm'd his heart; That heart, which every tender feeling knew, The soil where Pity, Love and Friendship grew.

Opposite is a neat Monument \"To the memory of Elizabeth Wastfield, who died at the Hotwells, the 26th December, 1770, aged 60, wife of Robert Wastfield, esq. of Mile-end, near London; this monument, from a just sense of her merit, and of his own loss, is erected by her dis- consolate husband. \" Dear shade, adieu, the debt of Nature's paid !

Dr. Nathaniel Foster, formerly prebendary of this church, and fellow of Christ-church college, Oxford, to whom we are indebted, for the most correct and beautiful edition, in quarto, of the Hebrew Bible, without points, ever published in Eng land. His excellent and justly-merited character is well drawn up in Latin. At the entrance of the choir from the southern asile, on a stone in the pavement, is the following"], [135, "115 inscription to the memory of a very eminent bishop of this diocese : H. S.

Her fine genius, and poetical productions are well known and deservedly esteemed. The above Mr. Love composed the following lines on a robin-red-brest, who frequently, in time of divine"], [136, "116 service, perched on one of the pinnacles of the organ, and joined the music with his warbling effusions, (as the story goes,,) for fifteen years together, till 1787. \" Sweet social Bird ! whose soft harmonious lays Swell the glad song of thy Creator's piaise\u2014 Say, art thou conscious of approaching ills f Fell winter's storms \u2014 the pointed blast that kills?

The colonel was burried at Brislington, near Bristol. \u2014 by Tyley. The next monument in this Aisle, is to the memory of Mrs. Elwyn, representing a beautiful Female figure sitting in meditation, underneath is the following inscription : \" Mari\u00e6 uxori Carissm\u00e6, anno \u00e6tatis Vicesimo Quin- to Erept\u00e6 Gulielmus Brame Elwyn, D. C. L. infelicissimus Posuit. Ob : Die Martii XXVIII. A. D. 1818. in Crypta Sti. Michaelis in hac urbe Ecclesi\u00e6 Jacet Sepulta.\" At the east end of the south aisle, to the memory of Mrs. Grosett is placed in a Gothic recess, a Black Marble Tomb, ornamented with Bronze, and a Mar ble Bible promiscuously laid on the top, executed by Tyley ; this monument has a solemn and appropri ate effect. On a Brass Plate is engraven the follow ing inscription : \" In the Vault underneath are deposited the Mortal Remains of Mary Spencer Grosett, the beloved Wife of J. R. Grosett, Esq. M. P. She Died at Lacock Abbey, in Wiltshire, on the 31st.

On the edge of the table, on Brass is engraven : \" We should say Thy Will be done.\" The whole of this inscription is uniformly engraven in Old English characters. ln a chapel, (called Newton's) to the western end of the southern aisle, are several grand monuments to the family of the New tons. One to the memory of Sir Henry Newton, of Bans-court, in the county of Glocester, knt. who died 1599, has this inscription: \" Courney, Hampton, Cradock, Newton last, Held on the measure of that ancient line Of Baron's blood ; full 70 years he past, And did in peace his sacred soul resign ; His Christ he lov'd, he lov'd to feed the poor Such love assures a life that dies no more.\" Close by is a lofty and ancient monument to the memory of Sir John Newton, Son of Theodore New ton, and His Lady Grace, Daughter of \u2014 Stone, esq. who died without issue, 1661, on one of the tablets: \" He was a man of great Courage, and the Greatest Loyalty to his Prince, an honor to his Country, a Credit and Noble ornament to his Name and Family.\" His figure lieth in armour underneath. Near this is another monument to the memory of Sir Richard Newton, who died Dec. 13th,1444. In Newton's chapel, is a monument by the cele brated Westmacott, R. A. of London, an elegant piece of workmanship, representing an Angel carry ing a young Female to heaven, their feet just rising from the globe, and in a square tablet underneath : \" Sacred to the memory of Elizabeth Charlotte Stan hope, youngest daughter of the late Philip Stanhope, esq. of London, and of Lympsfield in Surry : who"], [139, "119 departed this life 13th of June, 1816, at the Hotwells, Born Oct. 15th, 1798.\" On a Pillar opposite the entrance is erected an elegant monument to the memory of Antonii Hen derson, esq.

Tbe proportions and erection of this monumnt has been much admired. \u2014 Tyley, Sculptor. The cloisters may be entered from tbe western part of the church, it was a square of 103 feet each way, but the western and southern sides are taken down ; the eastern side leads into the chapter-house and bishop's palace: the first is an elegant, curions building of 46 feet by 26, and contains the library of the dean and chapter, and the last was repaired and partly rebuilt by bishop Butler in 1744. At this time happened the following accident : \u2014 A parcel of plate, supposed to have been hidden in the civil wars, fell through the decayed floor in a corner of one of the rooms ; the floor being taken up, a room appeared below, in which were found many human bones, and instru ments of iron to punish and torture criminals. At the same time was discovered a private passage to this dungeon, originally constructed with the edifice, being an archway within the wall, just large enough for one person to pass through ; one end terminating in the dungeon, and the other in an apartment which appeared to be a court of judgment. There are devine service and chaunting here every day at eleven in the morning and three in the after noon ; and a sermon on Sunday morning and prayers at five in the evening. In the tower are five bells, a tenor of about 2500 cwt. on which are struck the hours, two bells which sound the quarters, and two others that are tolled for prayers. The ancient and beautiful high cross, adorned with eight kings, which stood in the centre of College green, was taken down to lay open the principal"], [140, "120 walk, and given by dean Barton to Sir Richard Hoare, of Stourton, who has it erected in his elegant gardens. ln the elder lady-chapel of the cathedral is a device Of a Ram, playing on a violin with a remarkable long bow, and a shepherd sleeping while the wolf is de vouring the sheep. This proves that the use of the bow was known at the time of building this most an cient part of the church in 1148. Though some have supposed it was not known before the fourteenth century ; others have asserted that it was first used in England by the musicians attending the Pope's Nuncio, when he came here to receive the Peter-pence. The sub-sacrist is Mr. Phillips, who lives in the cloisters of the cathedral ; he is a very inteligent man, and will give every information respecting the anti quities of this place, to ladies or gentlemen wishing to gratify their curiosity.

Rowlie. THIS is commonly called Redcliff Church, being founded on a red sandy rock or cLift. Its pa- rish, with that of St. Thomas, Temple, and St. John's, at Bedminster, are equal to a city: and, like South- wark in London, lie on the southern side of the city and river. Camden observed, that \" this church is like a cathedral,\" for it rises to a noble heigth above the neighbouring houses, embellishes and dignifies that part of the town, and the various perspective views of the city. The same author has left on re- cord, that, \" on all accounts, it is the finest parish church in England.\" It is certainly a stately, vener able, and beautiful Gothic structure ; internally in high preservation, and an antique worthy the attention \u00bbf the traveller and connoisseur. R"], [142, "122 It was founded in the year 1292, by Simon de Burton, six times mayor of Bristol ; and was built of stone from the quarries of Dundry. It was many years in building ; brought to its present state (proba bly) by various benefactors, and according to the Mayor's Calendar, was finished in the year 1376, and was then celebrated all over England. The tower and spire, of stone, were about 250 feet high; but at St. Paul's tide, 1445, by a terrible storm of thun der and lightning, great part of the spire was thrown down ; and the roof, part of the nave, and particularly the southern aisle, were much damaged. The spire was never rebuilt, but was covered in as at present; and the church and roof were thoroughly repaired by a Mr. William Cannings, an opulent merchant, and several times mayor of Bristol ; of whom the reader may see further particulars in his epitaph. The church is about three furlongs from Bristol bridge, and stands on an eminence, on the southren side of Redcliff street. The Church-yard is inclosed from the street, and also on the other sides by a balustrade of freestone. The ascent to this structure is by a flight of steps of Purbeck stone, many of them eighteen feet long. The church is old enough to have a most venerable appearance, however it is a very light building, having many windows. Though the tower is large, it is richly ornamented with a variety of carved work, niches and statues. On the northern side of the tower are statues of our Lady and Jesus, and in a nook behind, of the Founder. Upon thd tow er are four high pinnacles, and part of the spire : from the middle of which rises a spindle that supports a large handsome gilded cock ; the height of the whole is 160 feet ; the belfry contains a sonorous, deep peat often bells, the heaviest in Bristol and these parts. In William of Worcester's notes on Bristol, are the weights of six of the bells (to which two were added in the beginning of this century, and two more in 1823) and that of the tenor is 7000lbs. and upwards. Bar rett, without authority, affirms, that all the bells were re-cast in 1762 ; the truth is, that only two or three of"], [143, "123 the upper bells were re-cast that were cracked or out of tune. The church is built in form of a cross, and, like a cathedral, the nave rises above the aisles, and is enlightened by a series of lofty windows on each side. It has one peculiarity that adds much to its internal beauty ; and that is, that the cross has a nave and aisles similar to the body of the church, which have a fine effect when the spectator stands under the middle of the cross and looks around him. Redcliff Church has received the general approba tion and applause of all good judges, for though it is spacious and lofty, it has a light and airy appearance ; the pillars are neat and slender, and wrought into the most delicate mouldings. The roof near 60 feet high, is arched with stone, and that of the nave and those of the aisles, which are all of stone, abound with devices and ornaments beautifully carved. The whole church, with our Lady chapel, is 239 feet in length, and the cross aisle from north to south 117 feet. The breadth of the nave and aisles is 59 feet, and of the cross nave and aisles 44 feet. The height of the aisles from east to west is 25 feet, which is the height of the two cross aisles from north to south. The height of the nave from the, western door to the high altar is 54 feet, equal to which is the height of the nave of the cross. The Lady's Chapel is 42 feet long, which is divided from tbe church, and is used as a school ; the length from the western end to the high altar is now 179 feet. In short, the arches, pillars, roof, and the whole building of this church are so truly light and elegant, that it may be deservedly viewed as a curiosity. The principal entrance is at the western door, which is eight feet broad and twelve high ; there are also two handsome porches on the northern and southern sides of the church. The northern portch is a most curious and beautiful gothic structure, especially in ternally ; and is worthy the attention of those who visit the church : it has some little pillars of stone called dumb organs, which, when struck by the per son who shows the church, sound like the deep notes of an organ out of tune."], [144, "124 The whole building is covered over with lead. The best views of the inside of the church are at the western door, under the middle of the cross, and at the high altar. Opposite to the pulpit is a throne, with a conopy, to receive the mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs, when they annually visit the tine old church on W hit-Sunday, on which day the floor is strewed with rushes, and the pews dressed with flowers. The floor of the chancel and steps to the altar are of black and white marble. At the entrance of the chancel are iron gates, gilded and richly ornamented; as there are also at the western entrance of each aisle of the church. The Altar is quite'in a rich and superb style. Over it are three capital paintings by Hogarth. That on the middle is the largest, and represents the As cension of Christ. That on the northern side is the High priest and servants Sealing the stone : and on the other, the women coming to look for the body of Christ, and the angel, who tells then \" he is not here, he is risen.\" All these are large and lofty, in rich carved and gilded frames. Sir Clifton Winteringham, baronet, one the king's physicians, presented to this church a picture of Jesus raising the daughter of Jarius to life, painted by Mr. Fresham, the baronet's nephew, of the royal academy. This is advantageously placed in the middle of the altar. In the centre of the cross aisles is a pillar and eagle of brass, the gift of a pin maker of this parish. At the western end of the nave stands on arches an elegant gallery of stone, with a dial in the front, on which is a grand magnificent organ, which for size, height, compass, diameter of pipes, and richness of lone, is excelled by none in the west. It measures in height from the ground, 53 feet, and contains up wards of 1000 speaking pipes, of which Messrs. Harris and Byfield, published an account at the time of its being put up in this church. The case is very elegant, and was designed by Mr. Strahan, architect, Who built Redland court house. This noble instrument has undergone several alterations and improvements by Mr. J. Smith, organ-builder of this city. It has two"], [145, "125 large horizontal bellows, nine feet square, which sup plies it with four times as much wind as the whole four of the old bellows, which were removed ; likewise a copula movemeut, to unite the choir organ to the great organ at pleasure, which gives it great power and variety, and to octaves of pedals for the feet. At the northern end of the cross is a baptismal font of white marble, beautifully constructed, placed on an elevated floor paved with marble and railed in. Under one of the arches of the tower is kept, .as a relic, a large crooked bone, called the dun cow's rib, said to be a rib of the monstrous dun cow killed by Guy, Earl of Warwick. 1 shall add to this short account of the curious beauties of this ancient fabric, that Leland called it, \" by far the most beautiful of all churches :\" and Camden, \"So large it is, and the workmanship so exquisite, and the roof so artificially vaulted with stone, and the tower so high, that, in my opinion, it is the most elegant of all the parish churches that 1 have yet seen in England.\" Divine service is performed here twice every Sunday and there are prayers in the week. The hours are struck on the great bell, and there are chimes at 1, 5, and 9, to an ancient solemn psalm tune, suitable to the grand tone of these venerable musical bells. This church is adorned with many elegant monu ments. At the sonth end of the cross aisle is a stately monument of Mr. William Canings in his magisterial robes, and of Joan, his wife, lying on an altar tomb, in full proportion, under a canopy, handsomely carved in freestone, and painted; within the statues are the following inscriptions, in a frame : \u2014 \u25a0 \" Mr. William Canings ye richest marchant of ye toune of Bristow, afterwards chosen five times mayor of ye said toune, for ye good of ye common wealth of ye same : he was in order of priesthood 7 years ; and afterwards deane of Westbury, and died ye 7th of Nov. 1474; which said William did build within ye said toune of Westbury a college (which his canans) and the said William did maintaine, byspece of eight years: 800 handy crafts men, besides carpenters and"], [146, "126 masons, every day 100 men.

One to the memory of Sir William Penn, knt. the father of Mr William Penn, who was one of the Friends, a considerable writer among them, proprietor of Pennysylvania, and founder of Phila delphia. \"Sir William Penn, knight, born at Bristol, 1621, of the Penns, of Penns-lodge in the county of Wilts. He was made captain at 21 ; rear-admiral of Ireland at 23 ; vice-admiral of England at 31, and general in the first Dutch war at 32 ; whence returning in 1653, he was chosen a parliament-man for Weymouth ; 1660, was commissioner of the Admiralty and Navy, governor of the forts and town of Kingsale, vice-ad miral of Munster, and a member of that Provincial Council ; and in 1664 was chosen great captain-corn-"], [147, "127 mander under his royal highness in that signal and most evidently successful fight against the Dutch fleet. Thus he took leave of the sea, his old element, but continued his other employs till 1669, when through bodily infirmities (contracted through the care and fatigue of public affairs) he withdrew, prepared and made for his end, and with a gentle and even gale, in much peace, reached his last and best port, at Wan stead, in the county of Essex, 16th September, 1670, being then but 49 years of age and four months. To whose name and merit his surviving Lady erected this rememberance.\" The other monument at the northern end of the aisle has the following inscription, by Miss Moore. \" Near this pillar are deposited the remains of Mrs. Fortune Little, widow of Mr. John Little, late of this parish. She died June 28, 1777, aged 57. \" Oh ! could this verse her bright example spread, And teach the living while it prais'd the dead ; Then, Reader, should it speak her hope divine, Not to record her faith but strengthen thine ; \" Then should her every virtue stand confess'd, 'Till ev'ry virtue kindled in thy breast ; But if thou slight the monitory strain, And she has liv'd to thee at least in vain ; \" Yet let her Death an awful Lesson give ! The dying christian speaks to all that livet Enough for her \\hal here her ashes rest, Till GOD'S own plaudit shall her worth attest* Hannah Moore. On the outside of the church, near to the southern end of the cross, fronting the east, at the second abutment, there is a small space inclosed with rails, within which, on a marble stone are inscribed the following lines, written by the late Rev. Emanuel Collins, Poet and Satirist of this city. \" All Flesh is grass ; And the beauty thereof as the flower of the fields \" Had restless time ! whose harvest is each hour, Made but a pause, \u2014 to view this lovely flower, In pity he'd have turn'd his scythe away, And left it blooming lo a future day."], [148, "128 But ruthless! he mow'd on, and it, u'as !

There was an ancient, elegant cross of stone in the centre of it, from which, formerly sermons were preached; it was taken down about 50 years ago. This vicarage, connected with those of St. Thomas in Bristol, Bedminster, and Abbots-Leigh, are in the gift of the dean and chapter of Salisbury, and afford a considerable income on the incumbent. From the leads of the Cathedral and Redcliff tow ers, there are delectable views of the city and country; up to these summits are good stairs of stone, and, in a fine day, strangers may gratify their curiosity con cerning the extent and situatfion of Bristol, better than they can from any of the neighbouring hills or eminences. , The gentry, whose curiosity may induce them to view this church, are informed, that the sexton lives at the southern end of Colston's parade."], [149, "CHAP. XIII. Other Churches, Chapels, and Buildings for Public Worship. THE other Churches in this city and suburbs are Nineteen ; the livings of nine of which are in the gift of the Corporation : those of Saints James, Paul, Michael, Jolm Baptist, Peter, Philip and Jacob, Mark, with Christ church and Temple. Three are in the gift of the Dean and Chapter of Bristol : All Saints', St. Nicholas and St. Augustine. Two are in the gift of the Lord Chancellor : St. Stephen and St. Wer burgh. St. John's Bedminster with St. Mary at Red cliff and St. Thomas, as named in the preceding page. St. Mary-le-port is in the gift of the Duke of Chandos. Some account of each of those follow alphabetically : ALL SAINTS' CHURCH, Corn Street, is a very ancient, neat gothic structure, with a modern tower, built in 1716, in which are eight musical bells, On the tower is a handsome octangu lar lanthorn or dome of stone, supported by eight arches and coupled Corinthian columns at each angle, and crowned with a gilded ball and cross. The church has three aisles ; the middle aisle is 70 feet long and 49 high ; the side aisles are shorter, but each of equal length, 30 feet high, and the whole 60 feet wide. The internal part is beautiful and elegant : the altar piece is rich, and has a painting of the Salutation of the Virgin Mary. The organ is gilded, and supported S"], [150, "130 by fluted pillars with Corinthian capitals. There are several monuments ; the principal of which are to the memory of \" Thomas Colston, Esq. Mayor and Alderman of this City, died 16th November, 1567. \"Death is no death, now Thomas Colston lives, Who fourscore years hath lived to his praise ; A joyful life now Christ lo him doth give, Who wrong'd no wight, each man commends his ways. Death him commands to bid this world adieu, Thrice happy those who die to live anew.\" There is also a noble and lofty monument of marble, to the memory of Edward Colston, Esq. who was a native of this city, and a great and eminent benefactor to it. His statue is in a recumbent posture, and ex quisitely done by Rysbrack : over it is an inscription of his many public benefactions. Sir John Duddl estone, bart. lies here, who was an eminent tobacco merchant ; and when prince George of Denmark came to see the city, was the first person who invited him to his house, in consequence of which, the prince first got him knighted, and then a baronet's patent. ST. AUGUSTINE's CHURCH, At the entrance of College-green, was mentioned in deeds so early as the year 1240 ; but in 1480, it was so decayed as to require to be rebuilt; since that it has been enlarged, and galleries built in it, to accom modate the inhabitants of this increasing parish. This church is in the gothic style, consists of three aisles, the principal of which is 102 feet in length, and the breadth of the whole 42 feet. It is a spacious, handsome church, and has a fine gilded organ in a mahogany case, a beautiful altar-piece, the pulpit in the middle aisle, and some monuments. The tower is about 50 feet high, the lowest in Bristol, and con tains a tenor and a small bell."], [151, "131 BEDMINSTER CHURCH, Dedicated to St. John Baptist, is very ancient ; on the north-west abutment of the tower is a stone with a date 1003 upon it, so that it must have been built in the reign of king Ethelred. It is a vicarage, and is mother church to Redcliff and St. Thomas, in Bristol, and Abbot's Leigh ; the parish is of large extent, and gives name to a hundred. This church (situated in a southern large populous suburb of Bristol) has two aisles, the longest about 90 feet ; a gallery, several monuments, and a handsome altar-piece. The tower is large, low, has stone railing, and four pinnacles, and a rising between them on the top, which supports a vane ; it has two bells, on the largest of which the hour is struck. This church has the appearance of great antiquity, and stands in a very pleasant and rural church-yard. CHRIST CHURCH Stands in the centre of the city. In taking down part of the spire of the old church to rebuild it, in 1765. a date of lead was found, let into the stone near the top, 1003 or 1004 : this was a handsome gothic structure, and was taken dowrn to widen Wine street, 1786, The present church was begun in the same year, and finished and opened about 1790. The body of the church having houses before it, is not visible in the streets, the tower only is apparent, all of freestone, (under which is the entrance to the church) and orna mented on the stage above the church, with sixteen Ionic pilasters that support four pediments ; the stage above this (that contains a peal often sine bells) has on each side four Corinthian pillars, and at each cor ner of the tower is a large handsome vase. On the tower is an octangular, perpendicular base of about fifteen feet high, which supports an octangular obelisk of 70 feet, on which is elevated a gilded dragon ; the whole is 160 feet high, and is one of the handsomest steeples in Bristol. The church is in the modern taste, the roof beautifully arched and stucco'd, and supported by columns with fine capitals ; has three"], [152, "132 aisles, elegant altar-piece, with a painting on the window of Moses, with the Tables of the Command- ments, and Saint John, which is well executed ; an organ with gilded pipes, and the church fitted up with gas burners. To this parish has been united by act of parliament, the parish of St. Ewen ; and the church and tower demolished, and the space occupied in making addi tional offices to the old Council house. This church was very ancient, mentioned in deeds so early as 1140; was the smallest in Bristol, and had only one aisle, 66 feet long. The tower was square, 60 feet high, had battlements on the top, and two bells. The cost of a breakfast on Corpus Christi day, 1160, is thus entered on the church book : Item, for a calves head and hinge - - 3d Item, for two rounds of beef - - - - 6d Item, for bread and ale ------ 8d Item, for Master Parson, for his dinner 4d Item, for the Clerk 2d Item, for bearing the Cross - - - - 2d CLIFTON CHURCH. The old chnrch, which stood on the summit of Clifton hill, (about a quarter if a mile from the boun dary of the city, at Jacob's well) being much too small for this increasing and beautiful parish, which contains some part of the liberty of Bristol, was taken down, and a new church built near to its scite, at a further distance from the road. It being finished, was consecrated by the Bishop of Bristol, on Mon day the 12th of August, 1822. This church is exe cuted in a beautiful style of modern gothic, and is 126| feet in length, and 81 feet in breadth, on the outer walls. It has a neat tower with equal pinnacles on the four corners of its top, and each has a vane ; there are three entrances, one under the tower and one on each side ; on the walls of these entrances are fixed the monuments preserved from the old church. The latter named entrances contain each a geometrical"], [153, "133 staircase which lead to the galleries, these are on three sides, and the upper parts contain 600 free sit- tings. The galleries and roof are supported by ei\u00b0-ht freestoue pillars, and four of cast-iron support the gallery on the west, which contains a Organ enclosed ma beautiful mahogany gothic case, enriched with carved work. The tone is rich and powerfnl, and considered by the best judges, to be one of the first in quality m England : it was built by Mr. Smith, organ builder of Bristol. * The altar is in a recess, fronted by an arch of superior workmanship ; in the centre is a beautiful gothic wiudow of painted glass, and on each side in gothic-shaped frames are the ten com- mandments. The whole of the floor is laid out with pews, and also the front parts of the galleries. An highly-finished pulpit of mahogany stands near the altar. There are also some neat modern monuments in this church, and we pronounce the whole to be highly finished, having a grand and pleasing effect. There is a cemetery under the whole church, contain- ing 176 vaults, which were regularly built with the foundation. Round the church is a considerable ex- tent of burial ground in addition to the original. In the front of the church near the road is the fol- lowing inscription on a stone, excepting the verses, which part is now removed : \" Sacred to the memory of George Lewis, fourth Son <,f Morgan Lewis, of St. Pierre, in the County of Monmouth, esq. who was unfortunately drowned in crossing the Severn in a small boat, on Sunday, 6tb of November, 1774, aged 16. \" As some young Pine of aspect tall and fair, That promis'd to reward the Planter's care ; \u2022 The Clifton Organ Is 25 feet high, 14 feet wide, and 11 feet from front to back, 110 has three rows of Kejs.

JAMES'S CHURCH, In St. James's Church-yard, was anciently a priory founded by Robert Rufus, natural son of Henry I. who was made lord of Bristol in 1 109, and died and was buried in this church 1147. It was built ;ind consecrated in 1130; made parochial, and the tower added 1374, by the parishioners, which is 90 feet high, has a modern ballustrade, and an urn at three of the corners, and at the south-west corner over the projecting stair-case, a lofty pinnacle with a weather cock on it ; and beneath in the belfry, an excellent peal of eight stout bells. The hour is struck on a hell elevated on the leads of the tower, in the front of which is alarge dial. The church is neat, and has archesof Saxon architecture ; the length of the church near 100 feet,, breadth 06, height of the middle aisle 47 feet. It has 3 galleries, fine alter-piece with a good painting of the transfiguration, and several elegant monuments. TheOrganatthis church was rebuilt by Mr. Smith, and opened on Sunday, the 2d of May, 1824, It is fixed in a new elliptical gallery, which is also made commodious for the charity children. For the infor mation of our readers we shall give a description of"], [155, "135 this noble Organ, which must be heard to be duly appreciated : J The new organ in St. James's Church, has four row, of Keys and an entire new Choir organ.

Also six copula or connect ing movements that affords tbe Organist an immense variety. The keys also are so disposed that be faces the congregation. By the use of tbe Copulas and Pedals, such power is obtained that quite astonishes tbe hearer, and has been the wonder of all who have heard it. So strict observers of the Sabbath were the people of this parish, that in 1679, at a vestry held, four persons were judged guilty of a most heinous crime, and where cited into the spiritual court for purloining the Lord's day in travelling to Bath on foot, to the great dishonour of Almighty God and true religion; for which they confessed their sins in the said court, and paid 20s. for the use of the parish. That part of the church-yard of St. James's appropriated for burying, is inclosed with a dwarf wall and iron pali sades, which adds much to the neatness and decency of the place, being thus separated from that part used only for the fair. ST. JOHN BAPTIST CHURCH. The church is handsome, 90 feet long and 24 broad, being one entire space without aisles, has a gallery and a cemetery underneath the Church. The tower stands upon the northern gate of the old city, has a dial to the north, and another to the south, and six bells, on the tenor of which is struck the hour ; ,and upon the tower is a neat spire of stone, ahont 1 10 feet high. j , Near the tomb of Walter Frampton the Founder; we the effigies of a man and woman in brass jet into stone, with six sons and six daughters, and the sol-"], [156, "130 lowing inscription: \u2014 \"Hie jacet Thomas Rowley, quondam mercator et vicecomes hujus vill\u0153 Bristolliaj qui qnidem Thomas obiit. 23d Jan.

Quorum anima ius propitietur Deus, Amen.\" Out of the mouth of the man comes a scroll, and thereon, \" Santa Maria ora pronobis.\" Out of the woman's, \u2022' SanctaTrinitas unus Deus miserere nobis.\" This monument is now covered, the church being floored with wood, and the founder's tomb removed nearer the altar, on the west side. In the cemetery under the church is a large tomb of alabaster, and on its side the figure of the six sons and six daughters, with their father and mother, without epitaph, but supposed to be for the above Thomas Rowley. The founder, Frampton, instituted two chauntries in St. John's. Thomas Chatterton somewhere observes, that Tho mas Rowley was chauntry priest of St. John's. We mention this to shew that the name of Rowley is not fictitious, as some persons have Very unadvisedly asserted ; on the contrary, it is evident a family of that name existed in Bristol in the fifteenth century. Whether the celebrated Thomas Rowley belonged to this family is a question which is not so easily solved as some have imagined. In the bede-roll of All Saints' Church, Walter Rowley and William Rowley are to be piayed for as benefactors to that church. In 1479 William Rowley of this city was buried in Flanders. ST. MARK'S CHURCH, in College Green, was formerly called the Gaunt s Church, and was collegiate. It was founded and built by the Gaunts and Goumeys, about 1230, whose tombs and monuments are yet to be seen in the aisle, The breadth of the church next to the Green is 39feet, the length of the body of the church 123 feet ; the breadth, exclusive of the aisle (which is not used for worship) 24 feet, the height 37. The tower is 91 feet"], [157, "137 high, has four pinnacles, and a peal of six bells. There are several good monuments both in the aisle and the body of the church. The organ has a gilded front ; the altar, which was of oak, being removed when the church was under repairs in 1818, the re mains of a beautiful carved altar piece of stone was discovered, and being repaired, it is now represented as in its primitive state. This church is a curacy, the property and under the patronage of the Corporation, who attend divine service in it, and therefore it is commonly called the Mayor's chapel, ln tbe front are a large gothic window, and freestone portico with five arches. ST. MARY-LE-PORT CHURCH, Commonly called Maryport, was founded by William Earl of Glocester, about 1170. It stands on a rising ground above the Avon, from which there was a gradual descent to the river, where, very anciently, vessels used to discharge their cagoes, whence came the title of Mary of the Port. This is a neat church, has two aisles, the southern is 107 feet long, the northern 73, and both 37 feet in breadth ; the arches and pillars are neatly fluted and painted ; there is also a fine toned organ ; and the monuments, epitaphs and altar, are worthy of notice. The tower is 70 feet high, crowned with battlements and pinnacles : to the top of the cock, on the largest pinnacle over the projecting staircase, is about 85 feet; and in the upper stage are eight bells. ST. MICHAEL'S CHURCH, On St. Michael's hill. There was a church here so early as 1193, but the present was founded in July, 1775, and opened in June 1777. The outside of the building is modern gothic, suited to the old tower, which is preserved, and about 90 feet high, has four pinnacles, and a peal of six bells. This church has three aisles, supported by handsome pillars of free stone, is 62 feet broad and 77 feet long, exclusive of T"], [158, "138 the tower to the west, and the chancel to the east; has a spacious gallery, neat altar-piece, brass branches and many handsome monuments. In the gallery is an elegant organ, which has had the following additions made to it by Mr. Smith, namely a beautiful gothic case with gilded pipes, it measures 17 feet in wedth, and 25 high, and contains those grand steps, the double, open, and stop'd diapason ; tbe largest pipe is one foot five inches in diameter, and has a most grand effect ; it has likewise a copula movement, to unite the choir organ to the great organ at pleasure, and one octave and half of pedals for the feet. This Organ is admired by the best judges for its elegance and richness of tone. There is a Cemetery under the whole church. ST. NICHOLAS CHURCH, Standing on the boundary of the old city, near to Bristol bridge, is of very ancient date, being founded by Earl Britrycke in the year 1030. The present structure (which is said to be the third on the same foundation) was finished in 1768, built of freestone in the modern Gothic. This is a stately building of 100 feet long, and 55 broad, being one lofty room without a pillar, and has a series of seven large win dows on each side : the ceiling richly ornamented with stucco, and the pulpit in the middle near the chancel ; the altar-piece very elegantly carved and gilt; the gallery, at the western end, the branches, and other furniture are very elegant ; the pews which are constructed upon a slope on each side to the cen tre, are neatly finished, and the whole has a light and grand appearance. The Organ. \u2014 The interior of this Instrument was rebuilt by Mr. Smith, in 1821, and the Case(whichis of oak and was made in the reign of Queen Anne, having her initials in carved-work in the cornice) had a new handsome gilt front put in, and the following improvements : The Compass now extends from F. iu alto to F.F.F. on all three rows of keys, it has two octaves of pedals, 03 which the Opeo Diapason it conlinned dgwn to CCC. sixteen feet."], [159, "139 The Great Organ contains, 1, Open Diapason.\u2014 2, Stopped Diapason. \u2014 3, Princi pal. \u2014 4, Twelfth. \u2014 5, Fifteenth. \u2014 6, Sexquialtra. \u2014 7, Trumpet.

The compass of the Swell is from F. in alto to fiddle G. but continued down to F.F.F. by a bass borrowed from tbe choir organ, which is found of great utility. There are two coupling movements whicli unite the threeorgans together, or at pleasure, by which means lbs organist (Mr. E. Hodges,) produces an excellent immitaltou of a Bugle Horn Stop ; indeed the variety which this instrument affords the performer is highly gratifying, and its tone and power very full and grand. The Choir organ is of a very peculiar quality, combining a dulcet sweetness and variety. On the tower is a beautiful spire, and the whole from the ground to the cock is 205 feet. The bells are a large, sonorous, musical peal of ten, the tenor of which, weighing 36 cwt. sounds the hour. Underneath the church is the Crypt, in which there are several monuments and tombs, the principal is that to the memory of John Whitson, Esq. which latterly stood in the portch under the tower, but now in its original situation : and a new monument is uow erected on the scite of the old one* under the tower, by the Treasurer of the charity, Alderman T. Daniel, Esq. which monument is beautifully carved in stone, and has Mosaic pavement of black and white marble in front, inclosed with curious cast-iron railings'; this monunent will also have a statue similar to the old one.

The following inscription appears in brass on the east-wall of the south aisle of the crypt, and receives light through an aperture of the wall that closes the old south door : \" This erypt is traditionally an ancient Cemetery of the original Church of Safnt Nicholas, which w*s foundid in tbe reign of Canute tbe Great, about the year of 0\u00abr"], [160, "140 Lord 1030 It appears to have been repaired and beautified during the reign of Edward III in the year 1361 ; a head of bis Queen, Philippe, bein- still perfect in the key stone of the first groin in the south aisle. It was afterwards used by the fraternity of the Holy Ghost as a Chapel, in the year 1503, and was religeously preserved, when the ancient church was taken down and rebuilt, in tbe year 1708. So long a period of time havino- injured some of tho arches, the foundations were carefully examined and repaired, and the whole building was restored to its original strength and beauty, ,\u201e the vear of Our Lord 1823. under the immediate superintendance of Mr. Jacob William Attwood, one of the Church-Wardens ; to record whose indefatigable zeal in the prosecution of so laudable a work, the Rev. John Eden, B.D. Vicar, and the other Members of the Vestry, have caused this Tablet to be erected.\" During the Service at all Burials in this Crypt, it is well lighted with mould candles, which adds much to the solemnity of the scene. ST. PAUL'S CHURCH, Portland square. The parish of St. James's being very large, and the buildings rapidly increasing, the parochial church had been long insufficient to con tain the inhabitants ; and an act of parliament was procured to divide the parish, and to erect anew parish church, dedicated to St. Paul. This was founded, April, 1789, opened on St. Paul's day, 1794; and is an elegant structure of stone, in the Gothic style. From the door under the tower to the altar, its length is 110 feet, breadth 60. The roof is supported by lofty pillars of stone, with fancied capitals, and is beautifully arched and stucco'd over the middle aisle. It has spacious galleries on three sides, their front nearly semi-circular, on the centre of which stands an excellent organ, the interior of which has recently been rebuilt by Mr. Smith, and the scale of the whole adapted to the present improved mode of building. The Oratories have heretofore been held in this church, and the organ universally met the disappro- bation of the performers, but it is now fully adequate to the purpose : the effect of the pedals and pedal pipes with its grandeur of tone has met the unquali- fied approbation of the most competant judges. It has a neat Gothic case with gilt front pipes : _ Description, \u2014 There are two rows of keys, the Compass of the Great organ is from F. in alto to G.G. and contains 1, Open Diapason. \u2014 2, Stopped Diapason. \u2014 3, Dalciani. \u20144, Principal \u2014 5, Twelfth.\u2014 6, Fifteenth \u20147, Sexquialtra.\u2014 8, Cornet.\u2014 9, Trumpet.

The pulpit is placed under the arch at the enterance of the chancel. The tower is lofty, has three stages and small pinnacles at the corners ; on it stands a square of less dimensions, with pinnacles, which contains a bell that announces the hour ; on this is another diminished square with pinnacles which sup port a large octangular pinnacle, crowned with a gilded vane. The whole somewhat resembles the steeple of the royal exchange London ; and (accord ing to the information of Mr. Hague, the architect,) is 169 feet high. Ten bells were intended for it by the parish ; of which the treble, the sixth, and a good deep tenor are put up. The chandeliers are very elegant. ST. PETER and PAULs CHURCH, In Peter-street, a very ancient structure, founded be fore the Norman conquest, and mentioned in a deed so early as 1130 ; has been often repaired, particu larly in 1749, at a great expence : and at a much greater in 1795, when several of the pillars and arches were taken down and rebuilt, the ceiling of the mid dle aisle neatly stocco'd, a new pulpit erected, and the church newly painted, gilded, and ornamented. It is now, internally, a spacious and beautiful church of three aisles, the middle 111 feet long and the two others 96 each. The roof, 36 feet high is supported by pillars and Gothic arches, and the breadth is 54 feet. It has a noble gilded organ, in a mahogany case, and some superb and ancient monuments ; one is within a gothic arch, adorned with a deal of curi ous workmanship, and various arms without any in scription : on a tomb is a figure of a lady finely carved, who was of the family of the Newtons of Barrs-court. The tower is built square, very large, or rather clum sy, about 80 feet high, of rough undressed stones, with battlements and pinnacles of freestone ; has a spindle on the middle of the leads, which supports a"], [162, "142 gilded cock. A good peal of eight bells, and a clock and dial, The tenor sounds the hour. In this church-yard was interred Richard Savage, son of the earl of Rivers, a great genius, and a good poet, but a very imprudent, and therefore an unhappy man. The calamities which he is said to have suf fered, and the cruelty of his mother, the countess of Macclesfield, were not so inimical to him, nor could they injure him so much as his own superfluous in dulgences, and egregious indiscretions. Being ar rested in Bristol, and confined for a debt, he wreaked his vengence on the town, in a poem entitled, \" Lon don and Bristol delineated.\" He died in Newgate, and was buried at the expense of the gaoler. ST. PHILIP and JACOB'S CHURCH, In its church-yard near the Old-market, is very anci ent, being mentioned in Gaunt's deeds, as parochial, before 1200. It seems to have been built at different times ; but the present church is large, consisting of a body, side aisles and chancel, the whole 126 feet in length, and about 60 in breadth. It has galleries and several handsome monuments : at the upper end of the northern aisle is a human figure of stone, in a sup plicating posture, with a crown about his head, pro bably of Kemys, who built that aisle, which is still called Kemys Aisle. Mr. Barrett supposed that this was the bust of duke Robert, eldest son of William the Conqueror, removed from the church of the castle to this. It appears from the kaxon Chronicle, that Robert was, in 1126, brought to Bristol and confined in the castle, before he was sent to Cardiffcastle;but this does not prove any thing about the bust. It is most likely that it was made before his confinement. This church is oruamented with battlements and a handsome portico of stone, a good western front, and a square tower with three small pinnacles, and a larger over the staircase, to the cock, of which the height is about 95 feet. In the tower is a good sound peal of eight bells, a clock, and dial in the front, the hour is struck on a bell elevated on the leads, on account of"], [163, "143 the great extent of the in and out parish, which is the largest in Bristol, and greater than several English cities. ST. GEORGE'S NEW CHURCH. In 1751 an act was passed for dividing St. Philip's parish, and for building a new church in Kingswood, which was begun 1752, completed and dedicated St. George. This is a handsome building of stone, in a modern style, with three aisles and a lofty square tower, and is one mile and a half from West-street turnpike, Bristol, in the upper Bath road. The living is in the gift of the corporation. The colliers of the forest were, 60 or 70 years ago, so barbarous and savage, that they were a terror to the city of Bristol, which they several times invaded : it was dangerous to go among them, and their dialect was the roughest and rudest in the nation ; but by the labours of Messrs. Whitfield and Wesley, by the erection of a parish church, and some meeting-houses, and the establishment of several Sunday and daily schools, they are much civilized, and improved in principles, morals, and pronounciation. St. STEPHEN'S CHURCH. Clare-street, was mentioned in deeds in 1304. The tower was erected about 1470, by John Shipward, a merchant and mayor of Bristol, is square, 140 feet high, has 177 stone steps up to the top, a sonorous peal of eight bells, a clock and dial. This lofty tower is finely proportioned, and ornamented ; finished with four pinnacles aud battlements of hollow work, so. light and elegant, that spectators are always struck with its beauty, and connoisseurs approve it, as one of the most elaborate specimens of the florid Gothic in England. The pinnacle over the staircase is circular, and contains a bell that announces the hour. The middle aisle of the church is 88 feet long, and above 50 high ; the southern aisle 88 feet long, and the nor then only 60 feet ; the height of the side aisles 25 feet, and the breadth of the whole 56 feet. The pillars"], [164, "144 which are neatly fluted and gilt, support gothic arches between the aisles and the body of the church, and a series of windows over them on each stde ; the roof, which is of wood, is neatly carved and painted. The pulpit is richly carved and decorated with cherub's heads, and the altar adorned with eight fluted Corin thian pillars, all which, with the pews and internal doors are of fine mahogany. Over the communion table is a painting of a dove, for the Holy Ghost ; and above that is a fine large painting, representing angels lifting up a veil, and discovering tbe glory of Heaven; done by the late Ross of Bath. Tbe monuments are worthy of attention ; the principal is that of Sir George Snigge, knt. of this city, serjeant at law, and one of tbe barons of the exchequer. His full-length figure, lying in his robes, beneath an elegantly carved and gilt monument, with an inscription in Latin. TEMPLE, or HOLY CROSS CHURCH; Thus nominated from the knights Templars, who wore a white habit with a red cross upon the left shoulder, and by whom it was founded in the reign of king Stephen, about the year 1145. This church seems to have been built at different times, is spaci ous and lofty and after Redcliff church, the largest in Bristol. There is an elegant gilded organ on a gal lery over the western door ; and the long aisles, large windows and arches, lofty ceiling, slender pillars, and light open area, have a pleasing effect on spec tators. The altar is rich, and adorned with four fine paintings of Moses and his Rod, Aaron and his robes, and Peter and Paul as large as life, in carved and gilt frames. There is a beautiful stained glass window over the middle aisle, or entrance to the Chancel, representing the ascension of Christ. There are se veral ancient brasses, inscriptions, and modern monu ments in this church, which brevity obliges us to omit. It has three aisles, and is from east to west 159 feet, and 59 wide, the middle aisle is 50 feet high. It i9 elegantly lighted with gas burners. But one of the greatest curiosities of Bristol, is the"], [165, "145 leaning Tower of Temple, the foundation of which has so sunk, that it is widely separated from the wall of the church, and so impends at the south-west corner, as to appear ready to tumble down. It is a venerable monument of antiquity : and though so lofty as 114 feet, (ending in a plain cornice, without rail, battlement or pinnacle) contains a good peal of eight hells, which are commonly rung, and on which the quarters and hour are struck, and chimes played at one, five, and nine : it is said, that when these are rung in full peal, if a basin full of water be put on the leads of the tower, it will soon be emptied by the vi bration of this apparently precarious yet permanent structure. The best place in which to view this tower is about the middle of Church lane, by the church-yard wall. ST. THOMAS CHURCH, St. Thomas-street, was mentioned in deeds so early as 1200, and was, next to Redcliff, tbe most elegant Gothic church in the city, and equalled by very few. It has, on account of its great age, been taken down, and rebuilt in a modern and beautiful style, by Mr. Allen, an ingenious, scientific and principal architect of Bristol ; and finished and opened on St. Thomas day, 1793. Its present length is 120 feet, and breadth 58. The roof of the middle aisle is lofty, and has a series of windows on each side, above the side aisles. The organ, its gallery, the alter-piece, and other decorations of this church are superb and elegant, and the monuments various and handsome. The ancient tower being judged strong enough, is left ; it is large, square, built of hewn stone, has railing on the top, a gilded cock highly elevated in the middle, and contains a deep grand old peal of eight bells, on the tenor of which is struck the hour. ST. WERBURGH'S CHURCH, Corn-street. To this Saint are also dedicated the cathedral of Chester, and a parish church in Dublin. St. Werburga was the daughter of Wulpherus, king"], [166, "146 of the Mercians, who, after living immaculate with her husband, Ceolredus, for three years, took the veil. History relates that the abbey out of which the See of Chester was formed, had been originally a Nunne ry, founded about the year 660, by the above kin::, in favour of bis daughter's indisposition to a marriage life. The original church here was founded about 1190, and the present tower built 1385; the church being very old and much decayed, was partly taken down, rebuilt in the Gothic style, and opened 1761. It has a very good freestone front, with large Gothic windows, suitable to the tower, which was preserved, and only the top of it altered and repaired. The present structure has three aisles, each 72 feet long, their breadth in the clear is 58 feet ; the height of the middle aisle, which is arched, is 26 feet, and of the two others 22 feet ; the roofs are supported by fluted Gothic pillars and arches. The altar piece and church are beautifully painted, ornamented and guilt; there are several monuments, among which is that of Ni cholas Throne, an eminent merchant of Bristol, who founded the City Grammar School, and died 1546. In the east corner of the church is a neat monument \"To tbe memory of the Rev. John Thresher San gar, M.A. late Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, and Curate of this Parish, born 29th September, 1781, died 4th July, 1818.\" The tower, a neat Gothic building about 100 feet high consists of four stages, well ornamented, crown ed with a battlement of hollow work, and three solid pinnacles; but over the stair-case, which projects circularly at one corner, and contains 160 steps, there is a large pinnacle of hollow work about 18 feet high to the vane. The third stage contains a peal of six bells. Bristol is remarked for good churches aud organs, and like York and Oxford, for a handsome shew of steeples, inmost of which are excellent bells. There are three peals of 10 ; eight peals of 8 ; and four peals of 6 ; amounting to 118 bells rung in peal ; besides several for clocks and other uses."], [167, "147 The Chapels of the establishment are five, including the latter three which are connected to their respec tive alms-houses. DOWRY-SQUARE CHAPEL, For the use of the nobility and gentry resorting to, and residing at the Hotwells, was built and is sup ported by their voluntary subscriptions. This is a plain building, has within it columns of freestone, which support the roof; a pulpit, a communion, benches for the audience, and at the southern side are two galleries one above the other. A small burial ground adjoins the back of the chapel. There are several monuments, on one of which is the following inscription : \u00ab' Near this place are deposited the remains of Sarah Stonehouse, the second Wife of James Stonehouse, m.d. more than twenty yearsPhysician to the North hampton Infirmary, and afterwards Rector of Great and Little Cheverel, Wiltshire. Come, Resignation, wipe the human tear, Domestic Anguish drops o'er Virtue's bier; Bid selfish Sorrow hush the fond complaint, Nor from the God she lov'd detain the Saint. Truth, Meekness, Patiences honor'd shade where thin*, And holy Hope, and Charity divine : Tho' these thy forfeit being could not save, Thy faith subdu'd the terrors of the grave. Oh ! if thy living excellence could teach, TJeatb has a loftier emphasis of speech: In death, thy last, best lesson still impart, And write, prepare to die, on every heart. Hannah More. She died December 10, 1788, aged 55 years. BE SERIOUS.\" Adjoining the above is a monument, \" To the Memory of Sir James Stonehouse, Bart. M. D. He died December 8th, 1795, in the 80th year of his age.\" Husband to the above. We here introduce the following on seriousness ; Sir Francis Wakimgham, secretary of state to queen Elizabeth, when wme of his visitor*, who were gay and frolicsome, observed to him that,"], [168, "148 \" he was serious,\" he replied, \" Life is serious, death is serious, time ii serious, eternity is serious, heaveu and hell are serious \u2014 how then should I be gay ?\" Archias, Lacedemonian, while at a banquet, received a letter, to inform him of a design to assassinate him, which the mesenger entreated him to read immediately, as it was on serious business : he replied, \" Pros aurion spoudaia,\" serious things to-morrow ; but he never lived to see to-morrow, for that r.ight he was slain. Serious consideration of the duties, circumstances, and uncertainty of human life, is the indispensible mental exercise of every rational creature ; but there is a time for all things, a time to weep, and a time lo laugh. A good man is cheerful at proper times, as well as serious, and rejoices is well as mourns; and none has such valid reason to be joyful and happy as the man who lives a righteous life. Therefore this injunction should be understood with some restrictions. For if religion be represented as consisting entirely of seriousness, artful designing persons may feign it, to acquire the character of sanctity (as many have done) and to carry on successfully their interested purposes. There may be serious hypocrites, serious cheats and thieves, nay, serious persecutors and murderers. Let not seriousness be esteemed the sole criterion of a religious character. Men must be known by the general and habitual tenor of their lives; by their actions, conversation, and example, public and domestic. The man who is reverential, pious, aud grateful to the Divine Being, and evinces that the leading endeavours of his life, are to become good, and to do good, HE ONLY is in the right way, and all others are wrong, whatever may be their faith, pretensions, or expectations. All who deceive ihemselvei with any thing short of doing their duty, may, at the close of life, be ready to exclaim with Grotius, \" Vitam perdidi operose nihil agendo,\" I have lost my life in laboriously doing nothing: or with the late Mr. Henderson, student at Oxford, \" I grieve for time mispent, and talents misapplied.\" ST. AUGUSTINE's CHAPEL, Situated on the north-west side of Great George-street, Park-street. This is a Chapel of Ease to St. Augus tine's church ; begun in September, 1821, and finished in August, 1823. It is 81 feet in length and 56 in breadth, the heigth 29 feet ; it has Galleries on three sides, and a double stair-case at the west, and a stair case on each side of the east ; the Pews, Altar, Pul pit and ornaments are neat and elegant ; this chapel is calculated to hold 1400 persons, two thirds of which are free seats.

FOSTER'S CHAPEL, Dedicated to the three kings of Cologn, was founded by John Foster, in 1504, who had been mayor in 1481, and is situated in Steep-street, St. Michael's, the rector of which parish is paid by the chamberlain of Bristol, for reading prayers, and a monthly sermon to be preached in this chapel. COLSTON'S CHAPEL, St. Michael's hill. Here are prayers read by a cler gyman every morning and afternoon, except when there is service at St. Michael's. TRINITY CHAPEL, Lawford's-place.

The vicar of St. Philip's hath \u00a38 per annum to read prayers here every Tuesday and Thursday for ever, and for a sermon and sacrament on Holy Thursday. This chapel was taken down to widen Lawford's-place, between west-street and the Old Market ; and is now neatly rebuilt in the Gothic style, with a small turret containing a clock, bell, and dial to the street. A sermon every Friday even ing gratuitously by the Rev. W. Day. There are also places of worship for all the deno minations in England that are popular, whose adher ents live in harmony, who meet, mix, and transact business, without malevolence or reflection ; and fre quently lend an ear to each other's preachers.

It is built in the Ionic style, with a balustrade on the top; on each side of the entrance are two columns, and ten ant\u00e6 round the building. On the top over the entrance is placed the figure of Justice, carved by Mr. Baily;"], [178, "156 on each side of the figure is an attic with a panne], containing the King's arms on one, and City arms on the other, in Bass-relief.

The present Collector is John Nightingale., esquire. THE POST-OFFICE, Is a handsome and convenient building of freestone, near to the western end of the Exchange, to which it is a wing, projecting forward into the street ; and there is another building exactly similar to it at the eastern end. THE EXCHANGE, Corn-street, built by Mr. Wood, architect of Bath, cost \u00a350,000, and was opened 1743. This is a very beautiful and elegant structure, 110 feet in front, and 148 in depth ; the whole building inside and outside, is of freestone. The principal front is upon a bold rustic basement, the central part of which breaks forward, and makes a tetra-style of almost whole columns, with Corinthian capitals supporting a pedi ment, in the tympan of which are the King's Arras, carved in stone. The space between the capitals of the columns and pillasters of the front, are silled with festoons which represent Great Britain and the four quarters of the world with their product and manu factnres. The southern front is to the general mar ket, consists of a rustic arcade, which and its super structure, have a central projection, that supports a pediment containing the Arms of the City ; on which is a turret with a clock and two dials, north and south, one for the Exchange and the other for the market. The place for the merchants is a peristile of the Co rinthian order, 90 feet by 80, and capable of contain ing 1440 persons. It is opened every day of trading from eleven till half past two.

This building, which is nearly opposite the Ex change, is formed for the conveniency of the mer chants of this city in transacting business, as it affords an eligihle situation from its nearness to the Post office of immediate communication, and concentrating a large mercantile body of men, causes a dispatch of affairs of trade and commerce. It is built upon a plan suggested by a Mr. Busby, of London, The front is in Corn-street, consisting of an Ionic portico of four columns, inside which, in basso relievo, appears Britannia, Neptune, and Mi nerva, presented with tributes by tbe four quarters of the Globe. The large room is GO feet long, 40 feet wide, and about 25 in heigth. Light is communicated by means of a circular lantern, surmounted by a dome. The heigth from the floor under the dome is 40 feet. It is elegantly lighted with gas lamps by night. The reading room is 30 feet by 20.

It was first opened in 1811. See annexed view. THE MERCHANTS' HALL, Prince's-street, is neatly built of freestone ; the access to the principal door is by a flight of steps ; on each side of the door, in a niche, is a vase, on both of which are carved the Merchants' Arms ; over the door, in a niche, is a bust of George 111. (when young) said to he a good likeness. The lobby leads into a lofty saloon, decorated, at the upper end, with a large mirror in a richly gilded frame, and with two glass lustres, suspended from the ceiling by gilded chains. On the north of this saloon is the opening into the principal room. These may be occasionally thrown into one, by opening tbe folding glass doors'fitted to a lofty arch embellished with carving. This room has four beautiful glass lustres, suspended by gilded chains, which, with the others, cost \u00a3550. Over the chimney-piece the Merchants' Arms are carved and hlazoned. There is here a half-length painting of Kdward Colston, esq. said to have been a strong re semblance ; from this picture liysbrack moddled a likeness of his face for his statue in All Saints' church. THE COOPERS' HALL, Ring-street, is a very noble freestone edifice ; the front stands on a low, rustic basement, and is orna mented with four superb columns, with Corinthian capitals, that support an atic story and lofty pedi ment, on which are the arms of the company. The principal room is large and lofty, with chandeliers, and a music gallery.

Thy gallant Ships, with spacious sails tinfurl'd, Waft lo thy shore the treasures of the World, With each production of the Easi and West Thy favoi'd Citizens are amply blest; Thy active Sons unceasingly are sway'd By Honor, Justice, and a thurst for trade. Around the Quay, in countless heaps appear Bales pil'd on bales, and loads of foreign ware. There the strong Porter constantly is seen With brawny arms to work the pond'rous crane. There, groves on groves of tow'ring masts arise In stately ranks, and penetrate the skies. Therertoo, resound the jolly Seaman's cry, As they their handspikes to the windlass ply ; With shouts sonorous shakes the neighbouring shore, While they, with cheerful souls, their lofty ships unmoor. The buildings appropriated to literature and amuse\" ments are various, and as follows. THE CITY LIBRARY, In King-street, founded in the year 1615. This is a handsome freestone building ; containing a copious and excellent collection of ancient and modern au thors, which are perpetually increasing by donations and annual subscriptions. The librarian is generally a clergyman, who has a sub-librarian to assist him. Mr. Catcott, late vicar of Temple, in this city be queathed to this library his whole museum of mine rals, fossils, and natural curiosities, with a valuable collection of books. A new wing was added to the building in the year 1786. The subscriptions are ten guineas at entrance, besides a guinea in hand, and a guinea and a half annually. Hours of attend ance, 11 'till 3, and 6 'till 9, Saturday evenings ex* cepted."], [183, "161 THE BRISTOL INSTITUTION, Tor the advancement of Science, Literature, and the Arts, is situated in Park street; the capital for erecting the building being derived from Shares of \u00a325 each, (which sum establishes a Proprietor). The Founda tion-stone was laid on the 29th of February, 1820. The building is now finished, with the exception of the fitting up of the Library ; and is ornamented ex ternally with a handsome Portico containing a Frieze Sculptured and presented by E. H. Baily, Esq, R. A. a native of Bristol. ln the interior are two Reading rooms, furnished with various daily and weekly News-papers, English and Foreign periodical Publications, Maps, and a Library of Reference ; a Committee room surrounded by glass cases, containing a collection of about 350 species of stuffed Foreign and British Birds ; a Lecture room, capable of accommodating 350 auditors : a Laboratory and Aparatus room, containing Philoso phical Aparatus, &c. Up stairs there is a great room of 60 feet by 30, and 25 in height, hitherto used for the gratuitous Exhibitions of Paintings by Bristol Artists, and Pictures by the old Masters, furnished by the liber ality of Proprietors residing in and near Bristol, to aid the fund of the Institution. The Museum, containing a fine collection of Shells presented by Mrs. Lovell, widow of the late Dr. R. Lovell ; a collection of Fossils deposited by Mr. J. S. Miller ; specimens of stuffed Quadrupeds and Reptiles ; Skeletons, Dresses of Foreign nations, &c. all presented by the friends of the Institution, ln a room opposite the museum are the fine Casts, from the \u00c6gina Marbles, the originals of which are in the possession of the King of Bavaria, at Munich. Behind the great room is a room containing the Blisset collection of Minerals, purchased by subscription entered into at the first annual meeting, and presented by the 75 subscribing gentlemen, to the Institution. Here also a good col lection of Geological specimens, &c. is preserved.

He also receives, on subscribing to Lectures, (at which money is taken) an additional transferable ticket; and has liberty to introduce Strangers to tbe Reading rooms, and Mu seum. Proprietors holding Shares unoccupied may nominate, the Nominee paying two Guineas to the Institution, and one Guinea to the Proprietor. Strangers residing in and near Bristol, may have admission to the Reading-Rooms, by a subscription for a period not less than six, nor exceeding twelve months. Since the opening of the Institution several courses of Lectures on Chemistry, Botany, Anatomy, &c. have been delivered. A Philosophical Society has been formed by the members of the Institution, who have during the winter, monthly meetings, at which Papers on vari ous subjects are read in the Theatre, and each member is allowed to introduce two strangers. The Society has elected several highly distinguished scientific men, for Honorary members and Associates. Although this Institution can hardly be said to have existed more than two years, yet its progress has been astonishing, of which its museum, &c. will give ample proof. It is unincumbered with debts, the whole building and all in it being paid for, and its annual income bids fair in a short period to increase to a sum adequate to its wants. The Institution is open every day from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night,\" (Sundays, Good friday, and Christmas day excepted).

THE THEATRE ROYAL, King street, is a perfect model of elegance and con venience : the internal part round the pit is semi-cir cular, has two tiers of boxes, a spacious gallery, and the whole decorated with carving, gilding and painting in a superior style. The late Mr. Garrick, who surveyed it before it was quite finished, pronounced it to be the most complete in Enrop;: of its dimensions, and wrote a prologue and epilogue, which were repeated by Powell and Arthur when it was opened, May 30, 1766, The theatrical performances here are little (if any) inferior to those in London. Here, amusement, literature, improvement, and a school for elocution, are united. Theatrical oratory, whether tragic or comic, undoubtedly may be rendered useful as a standard of pronounciation ; and as a means of diminishing and gradually annihilating provincial im proprieties and inelegancies. The present manager, Mr. M'Cready, has done much to its improvement, both in decoration and scenery, and certainly merits the countenance and support of the Public at large. THE ASSEMBLY ROOxMS, Princes street, has a beautiful front of freestone which consists of a rustic basement, with a central projec tion supporting four columns of the corinthian order, which are coupled and crowned by an open pediment ; on the frieze is the following sentence in relief: Curus Cithara tollit. \u2014 Music dispels Care.

XV. The Public Buildings dedicated to Beneficence; the Schools, Hospitals, Alms-houses, and Charitable Foundations and Institutions of Bristol. It is well known that descriptions and characters of cities have been extravagantly exaggerated. Most people are zealous for the honor and advantages of their own town, city, or nation : this zeal has its uses, but is frequently the occasion of disputes and vain glory.

After a review of these charitable Institutions, the reader must certainly feel himself gratified that such philanthropic breasts have been found thus to melt at other's woe ; but it must be acknowledged that the persons residing in these places are still objects of commisseration, many of whom have been respectable trades-people is this city, and in their time have con tributed to the support of the poor of their respective parishes. We therefore hope, that some benevolent persons of property may come forward to assist those excellent Institutions, which would enable the trus tees to increase their small dependance. HOSPITALS. St. Peter's Hospital, St. Peter's-street, is the gene ral Hospital for the poor of the whole city, including superannuated persons, orphans and idiots; and has a ward for lunatics.

The building is ancient and spa cious, it was the Mint for coinage of money in 1422, which is now its most general title, and in the eighth of William III. erected into a City Hospital, with a governor, deputy, treasurer, guardians, physician, surgeons, apothecary, chaplain, and other officers. It is supported by annual assessments on the pa rishes of Bristol. The Infirmary, in Marlborough-street, St. James's is a noble, extensive, and well built edifice, and is in an elevated and healthy situation, to the north of the city ; it has two wings, and the whole inclosed with iron pallisades. This is an ample receptacle for inva lids and casualties, and is a most excellent, liberal and unlimited institution : all persons, without regard to"], [194, "172 country, colour, or dialect, who are accidentally in jured, are on application, immediately admitted,with out any recommendation whatsoever : and all persons of town or country, labouring under acute or chronic disorders, by a note from a subscriber, are admitted on Monday and Thursday. This charity is supported by annual subscriptions and donations, which enable the conductors to make ample provisions for the pa tients. This is now the principal city and country Infirmary of the west of England, has generally about 200 in-patients, and assists numerous out-patients with advice and medicine. It has a treasurer, four physicians, five surgeons, one resident apothecary, a matron, a secretary, and also a chaplain, who reads prayers in the several wards. \\ Bristol Dispensary, North-street, and Queen Square, for lying-in woman, and general relief; supported by voluntary contributions.

It extends to all proper objects of both sexes, who apply for admittance, from every part of the united kingdom. Its principal manufacture, are fine and coarse baskets, which are constantly on sale at the asylum. Conducted by a committee of 20, and supported by voluntary subscription; a benevolent and praise-worthy institution! may it have ample"], [195, "173 encouragement from those who can clearly see cor poreally, and discern mentally, its unspeakable proprie ty and probable utility. Let the following old stanza excite those to gratitude and generosity who are in full possession of all their senses, and of a plenitude of the good things of this life. \" I see blind people with my eyes, To Hospitals 1 walk ; I hear of them that cannot hear, And of the dumb 1 talk.\" Penitentiary, Upper Maudlin-street. This valua ble institution, established 1800, receives those un happy females who have strayed from the paths of virtue and have a desire to recover their character. \u2014 They are employed in needle-work, &c. till they are deemed worthy to be placed in situations or restored to their friends.

To reach those varieties of wretchedness which in the lustre of large establishments pass unnoticed, or for which no provision is made, and to relieve only after full investigation ; to aid in procuring parochial assistance for those who shall be entitled thereto, but whose claims are remote ; and to prevent the laborious poor from sinking, through casual pressure, into hopeless beggary, are the objects of the Samaritan. Strangers' Friend society, instituted in the year 1780, for the purpose of relieving sick and distressed stran gers, and other poor, at their respective habitations. National Benevolent Institution, (Bristol district,) for the relief of distressed persons in the middle ranks of life, of whatever country or persuasion; supported by annual subscriptions, (usually five shillings,) by donations and becpiests.

We should not forget the numerous and respectable society of the Captains of ships, who meet together in Autumn at tbe Bush tavern, and go in procession to the Cathedral, to attend divine service and a ser mon, then proceed to some public ball to dinner, and afterwards subscribe liberally to the support of a fund for the maintenance of the widows of any of the deceased members. This society flourishes and in creases in opulence, is properly adapted to the pre cariousness of tbe lives of seamen, and found of great utility to surviving widows, and their families. Also an annual subscription for the discharge of debtors in gaol. The before-named Institutions are all supported with a truly christian spirit of love and benevolence. The names of most of the gentlemen conducting them are annually inserted in tbe Bristol Directory. This city has a long list of benefactors to boast of, who have left large sums of money, or estates in land to charitable uses. The corporation of Bristol have, to their honor, recorded them all in a book, open to the inspection of the whole body, where the wills are all inserted, the lands described which are allotted for their support, and their ends ascertained : so that nothing but wilful inattention and neglect can ever occasion their being misapplied or lost. Barret, in his history, gives a long list of donations to the city in lands and money, which are to a vast amount, but too numerous to insert in a work of this limitation. It may not be improper, to notice here Alderman Whitson's Gift-money to poor housekeepers and lying in women, and Dr. Thomas While's \u00a3\\0Q. annually for repairing the highways about Bristol."], [199, "CHAP. XVI. The Public Statues ; Internal Beauties ; the Amusements, Inhabitants, and Dialects of Bristol. THE Equestrian Statue of William III. in Queen* square, deserves particular attention. The horse is exquisitely well done, the king is habited as a Roman emperor, his right arm is extended, and he points with a truncheon, as if commanding, which is strong ly expressed by the mouth, features of the face, and position of the head. This is universally allowed by connoisseurs to be the noblest equestrian statue in the kingdom. It is thus adverted to by M. H. Jones, in his poem entitled Clifton : \u2014 \"What grand magnificence on Virtue grows, What squares, what palaces, of late arose; How wealth, how laste, in every pile appear, With still improving grace from year to year ! Lo, Queen's \u2014 enrich'd by Rysbrack's Roman hand, See William's finish'd form majestic stand ; His martial form express'd with attic force, Erect, like Antonine's, his warlike Horse; With lofty elegance, and grecian air, To feast the well pleas'd eye, and 6LI the Square.\" The statue of Charles II. in Royal Robes, with a globe and sceptre in his hand, standing in a nmch in front of the Guildhall, is in a good bold attitude, and is well executed. The statues of the kings Belinus and Brennus, at St. John's-gate, have a most antique and venerable ap pearance. On Temple conduit near Temple Church is a noble statue of Neptune, cast of Lead, who holds in the hand of one extended arm a trident, and in the hand Aa"], [200, "178 of the other the tail of a fish, whose head is under one of his feet. There is a very decent statue of the founder or benefactor of Trinity Hospital, Old-market, in a niche at the upper end of the building. The statues on thenorthen side of the College,gate, though ancient, deserves notice : the two crowned kings are for Henry II. and king Stephen above him ; on the other side of the arch the lower statute is of Robert Fitzharding, the founder of the church, the other is not known ; on the southern side, the two lower statues are of the Abbots Newland and Elliot ; one of the statues above was for the Virgin and Child, the other is unknown. Though strangers who visit Bristol must expect to see a very ancient city, and many disagreeable irre gularities, in the most frequented entrances into it, yet it is not without its regular piles of building. Redcliff parade, and its prospects, exhibit many civic beauties ; the Quay, from the Stone bridge at the end of Quay street, with the ships on tbe Froom, to its influx into the Avon ; also views from the Broad quay, St. Augusine's parade, and upwards to College green, are very notable and pleasing. The views of the lofty hill of St. Michael, and its numerous streets and places, from St. James's church-yard, are undeniably pleasant and sublime. The Church and steeple of St. Paul's are striking beauties at the western entrance of Portland square. Many situations in St. Paul's and St. James's parishes are very agreeable ; nor is the opening to the northen road, called Stoke's croft, deficient in point of attraction, since numerous piles of building are erected on the hill to the north-east, called Montpelier, very admirably situated with gar dens and beautiful prospects of the city 'and country. Glocester and Penny well roads, to the north east of Bristol contain several new piles of building, cottages and villas, which have excellent prospects, and much improve that part of the suburbs. The squares have been particularized : the streets in the vicinity of College green, and Park street above all, may have"], [201, "179 degrees of beauty attributed to them. There are alse many delightful propects of the lower parts of th , city from the upper parts, Kingsdown, St. Michael's' Brandon, and Clifton Hills. \"The views from Bris tol Back, downwards and Redcliff church and parade ; upwards, of Bristol bridge, Bridge street, St. Nicholas church, &c. exhibit, undoubtedly, internal beauty. The central parts of the old city, which are much loo narrow and confined, is so enriched by the public buildings, churches, and stately steeples, that it may fairly lay claim to approbation. Thus is Bristol pleas ingly varigated with ancient and modern buildings, plains and eminences, and by every sort and style of building common in England. Large, splended buildings in thy streets abound ; Thy suburbs too delightful walks surround ; Without thy walls, array 'd in smiling green, Are tow'ring hills and charming landscapes seen. In Bristol there are people of different countries, languages, and religions. Next to the natives, the Welch are most numerous, or those of Welch extrac- tion : this appears by the names so frequently met with, such as Morgan, Griffith, Jones, Evans, Bevan, Edwards, Rice, Price, Davis, Lewis, James, Thomas, Williams, &c. : the number of those in trade, paricu- larly, may be seen in the Bristol Directory. There are also many Irish here, who inhabit, principally, about Marsh street, and the Quay, and frequently use their own national language ; most of these are Catholics, but the Welch are generally Methodists or Baptists. There are many Scotch in Bristol, also a few French, Dutch, Italians, and Spanish. Here are many Jews, some natives, and others from various parts of the world. The counties in the vicinity, Glocestershire, Somer- setshire, &c. furnish the city with a continual sup ply of new inhabitants. Many natives of Lond on reside here ; and there is a perpetual interchange of inhabi tants between the two cities. People from all parts of the Island come hither, and there is every dialect used in Bristol that is known in England. Therefore,"], [202, "180 any general character of such an heterogenious mix ture of people cannot be given. The natives pro nounce English better than at any othe* part of the west of England; though they retain some peculiarities oi Glocestershire and Somersetshire. Well-bred peo ple pronounce with more propriety ; and those of the different parts of tbe city speak very differently ; those of the western much better than those of the eastern. There are every gratification and amusement in Bristol that a rational person can desire. They who are for pedestrian exercise have convenient walks within, and superlatively pleasant and delightful walks without the city. The equestrians have at their elec tion, the adjacent downs of Durdham and Leigh, the Hills to Portishead, Walton and Clevdon, in view of the Bristol Channel ; the delightful villages of Ashton, Leigh, Wraxal and Backweil on the one side, and of Kingsweston, (tbe seat of Lord de Clifford) Westbury, Henbury, Alrnondsbury, Stapleton, and Frenchay on another, and we may add Brislington, Knowle, Dundry, and the New and Old Passages, excursions which add greatly to the health and felicity of the inhabitants. On the entrance to Bristol from Bath there is a carriage road beginning at Hillsbridge, and continuing by the side of the New River, and passing Bathurst Basin, the new Gaol, to Cumberland Basin, and thence to the Hotwells. A new carriage road is made at the Hotwells, passing the Pump room on the side of the river, taking a direction up the Rocks to Clifton down, and thence to the New and Old Pas sages. This is the most pleasant ride about Bristol. Those who are fond of the Water may make most pleasant voyages down the channel, as low as the Flat Holme, where their is a good house of entertain ment. For the lovers of music and dancing, the con certs and balls, frequently at the Clifton hotel, in the Mall ; at Glocester Rooms, Hotwells, and at the As* sembly Rooms, Priices street."], [203, "CHAP. XVII. The different Classes, Manners, Customs, Peculiarities, Coffee-Houses, Taverns, Inns, Newspapers, Earldom, Representation, best perspective Views of Bristol, and summary Particulars. AS there are many people of fashion and fortune, who are constant residents at tbe Hotwells aud Clif ton, so there is a great influx of nobility and gentry from all parts to these places during the months of Summer. These well-bred people circulate cash; enliven and embellish the city; introduce propriety of diction; taste for literature, novelty of fashion, and elegance of address ; so that the inhabitants can not fail to profit by their arrival. The ladies, gentle men, and decent ranks in Bristol, dress fashionably, having Bath almost at their gates, and Clifton and the Hotwells under their inspection. It has been frequently observed, that formerly, the ladies of Bristol were noted for homeliness of person, and an ungraceful appearance. It is difficult to ac count for such a native and universal deformity as have heretofore been their characteristics. These attributions might possibly be, as many other local reflections and stigmas are, utterly groundless, but whether so or not, at present the contrary is abso lutely the case. Many of the fair sex here are truly fair, and England cannot produce finer and more beautiful women than the city of Bristol. I hope the reader will excuse me, if I borrow a few of Mr. Thome's pretty lines on this very subject."], [204, "182 o! mid the spacious walks of College-green, What num'rous crowds of blooming nymphs are seen ! Beneath the branches of th' extended trees They take their circuit, and imbibe the breeze. \"Not Helen's face, which prov'd the fall of Troy, Outshone the charms Bnsiola's Fair enjoy ; With these, Diana, and her virgin train, May vie for beauty, but may vie in vain ; Not Venus' self, where Venus to appear, Could look, in figure, or in face more fair : The graceful form with rapture I survey, And piercing eyes, where sportive Cupids play : The swelling breast, more white than Alpine snow, Where honour tiiumphs, and tbe virtues glow; In charms like these, Bristolu's daughters shine, And boast a semblance equal to divine. The people of Bristol are strict in the observation of the Sabbath. At nine o'clock in the morning, the tenor bells of all the parish churches are risen, rung a knell for half an hour, and fallen ; then the bells in each tower are chimed for some time, which makes a solemn jingling ; these are succeeded by small bells, which toll the people into church. The same commences at two in the afternoon. Just after the beginning of Divine Service, the constables of each ward go about their respective districts, to rid and 6hut up the public-bouses. The birth-day of Mr. Colston, Nov. 13, that liberal benefactor to this city, is observed here with great ceremony. As soon as the 12th of November is over, at 12 at Midnight, the great bells at redcliff are rung muffled ; and so are all the bells of the city, in turn, till dawn of day ; and from thence to the close of this holiday. Also various charitable societies meet, dine, and deposit their contributions in honor of his memory. COFFEE-HOUSES, INNS, & TAVERNS. There are four coffee-houses here ; the Bush, or Jack's Coffee-house, Corn-street ; the British Coffee house, in Broad-street; the Assembly Coffee-house, on the Quay, and Warne's Coffee-house, Hotwells. There are many excellent and accommodating J nns and Taverns in the city, among which the following"], [205, "183 are chief, viz. Bush, Corn-street ; White Lion, White Hart, Broad-street ; Talbot, Bath-street ; George, and Saracen's Head, Temple-gate; Fifll Moon, North street; Greyhound, Broadmead; White Horse, Horse fair ; Rummer, All Saints' lane ; Montague, Kings down Parade ; Bell, White Lion, Three Kings, and Three Queens, Thomas-street; Red Lion, Queen's Head, and Angel, Redcliff-street : White Hart, Old Market-street ; Reeves's, College-place, and many others which would be too numerous to insert. It is the custom here for all parlour and creditable visitants of public-houses to drink out of plate ; tan kards and pint cans as they are termed. Therefore as the public-houses, and their frequenters, are very numerous, perhaps there is not a city in England so rich in silver as Bristol. There are four Newspapers printed here weekly. Felix Farley's Bristol Journal, published Saturday morning at 7 o'clock, by J. M. Gutch, 15 Small-street. Bristol Gazette,, (for Thursday) Wednesday even ing, at 7 o'clock, by John Mills, 16, Corn-street. Bristol Mirror, or Bonner and Middleton s Bristol Journal, Saturday morning at 7 o'clock, by A. Brown, 20, Small-street. Bristol Mercury, Monday morning at 6 o'clock, by T. J. Manchee, 30, Quay. The other papers in common circulation are, all the London papers ; and of country papers, the three papers of Bath ; the Glocester Journal, Sherbourn Mercury, &c. The Earldom of Bristol was formerly in the family of Digby ; it is now in that of Hervey. The present earl is a Clergyman ; the Right Rev. Lord Frederick Hervey, D.D. Bishop of Derry, in Ireland. Bristol was a borough at the Conquest, and very early sent two burgesses to Parliament by ancient perscription. A list of its representatives is extant from the 23d of Edward I. 1295. None can vote for members but those who are freemen by birth, free hold, servitude, purchase, donation, or by marrying a freeman's daughter. The number of Freemen is"], [206, "184 about 8000. The present representatives are, Rich ard Hart Davis, and Henry Bright, esqrs. Strangers who shall be desirous to view the city from the adjacent bills may be recommended to Brandon hill, a pleasant lofty conic eminence or mount, about 250 feet in perpendicular height from its base, from which it rises almost to a point, and is partly covered with verdure and some bushes, on which the neighbouring laundresses dry their linen. It is named from a chapel dedicated to St. Brandanus, which formerly stood on its summit. It affords those who mount it a beautiful view of part of Bristol (a great part being intercepted by St. Michael's hill) and of the country for many miles round, particularly of Landsdown, some buildings of Bath, Dundry hill and tower, beautiful village of Clifton ; Leigh and Durdham downs, the Welch mountains beyond the great river Severn; Kingswood ; and the river Avon, at the foot of the hill, and at a little distance, the New river. This hill appears to be a rock covered with a thin stratum of earth, which in some places is deficient and leaves the stones quite bare. The rock is valued by artists for grinding colors or hard sub stances, for which there is not any stone known to be superior to it. In the civil wars the top of this hill was fortified by the monarchial army, against the parliament of England, and part of the trenches yet remain. On the southern side toward the bottom is a neat and pleasant path that leads to Clifton. Near this is a row of decent houses, neatly built, and named the Queen's parade; the eastern side of the hill is covered with new and elegant buildings, as already noticed. Here Mr. Thorn's lines on Brandon-hill merit our notice. To Brandon hill roy journey I pursue, From whence Bristolia forms a pleasing view. Now, on its summit, as I musing stray, 1 trace the spot where hostile Britons lay ; But discord, now and civil wars, are o'er, And joy, and commerce bless Bristolia's shore : Now, from each quarter, clouds of smoke appear, Mount their black columns, and dissolve in air ;"], [207, "185 Buildings superb, and lofty spires surprise The gazer's senses, and enchant his eyes ; Whilst to his ears, in quick vibration\", come The noise of works, and city's ceaseless hum: The shouts of sailors, as their castles ride With waving streamers on the rhrystal tide ; All which declare to Bristol's busy thrpng, That commerce, wealth, and industry belong. There is a beautiful view of Bristol and the country from Montpelier, situated to the north. Totterdown and Pile hills, without Temple-gate, command vari ous and pleasing prospects of the city and Clifton ; from Bedminster down there are uninterrupted views of the whole extent of buildings from St. Vincent's rocks west, through Clifton and over Bristol to its eastern extremity. In the apertures between the buildings in Horfield road, St. Michael's, and on Kingsdown to the end of Somerset-street, Nintree hill, are views of considerable extent of the eastern part of the city, and adjacent country and villages. There are also delightful and enchanting prospects of the city and country from Clifton fields, leading to Ashton, Dundry, Knowle, road to Brislington, Bar ton hill, St. George's, Stapleton hills, and from many surrounding eminences, which present indescribable and innumerable beauties. The park St. Michael's, is One of the best frequented walks of Bristol ; this presents views of the western part of the city, and its new buildings ; and of the house of Thomas Tyn dal, esq. in the fort, which is a capital mansion, built of stone, with three good fronts towards the park. Bristol, and its appendages, contain 750 streets, squares, open places, lanes, alleys, and courts ; have 56 superb or handsome places of worship ; 1 1 mar-* kets for various commodities ; 412 licensed houses, comprising Inns, Taverns, Public-houses and Li quor-shops ; and 10 banks or companies of bankers ; the particulars of all which may be referred to, and the numbers of tradesmen ascertained by perusing the pages of the Annual Bristol Directory. Bb"], [208, "CHAP. XVIII. Account of some Eminent Persons and Authors, Natives of Bristol. SEBASTIAN CABOT, the discoverer of New foundland in 1498, was born in Bristol, of Genoese parents. He was commissioned by Henry VII. who ordered a ship to be victualled and manned for him at Bristol, to make American discovery : he found the inhabitants of the island cloathed with the skins of beasts, and great plenty of bears who catched fish with their claws. King Edward VI. 1549, granted to this Sebastian, an annuity of .\u00a3166 for his natural life, and appointed him grand Pilot of England. William of Worcester, priest of St. James's parish, was born on St. James's back ; his father was a skin ner and glover. In 1431 he was sent to Hartshall, in Oxford. He is said to be tbe first who translated any of Cicero's works into English, which was his dis course upon Old Age, presented by him to W, Wain fleet, Bishop of Winchester, 1473, and he complains that his present was without any beneficial effect to himself. To him we are indebted for his Latin notes on Bristol, written about the year 1480, which con tain particular descriptions of the churches, religious houses, streets, lanes, and every thing worthy of notice in this city, His manuscript lay long hid in Bennet college, Cambridge, but was decyphered and published by Mr. Nasmith, in 1778. William Cannynges, a great merchant of Bristol : a friend and patron of learning and religion, a bene factor to the poor, and a repairer and finisher of Red cliff church, was born in Bristol, and was five years"], [209, "187 old at his father's death in 1405. His brother Thomas was then ten years old, was afterwards sent to Lon don, became a grocer there, and served the office of Lord mayor in 1456, the very year in which his brother William was mayor of Bristol; so that London and Bristol, the two principal trading cities, had two brothers for mayors in the same year. A house occupied by Mr, Birtill, in Redcliff street, was the residence of William Cannynges. It is large, and throughout exhibits an idea of that worthy and opulent merchant's distinguished and elevated station in life. Here also is a Chapel, which for twenty years was open to the view of the inquisitive stranger, we are sorry to find, owing to recent alterations in tbe house, it is now very much dilapidated ; the roof how ever is entire, several monuments remain, and the ornamental part is removed, which to the eye of an antiquarian, is, perhaps, more congenial, than when embellished with more modern objects. On the south side a gallery of oak leads into a spacious room, at the further part of which appears a smaller one, said to have been his study. From this latter place the celebrated chest whence the poesies of Rowley came, is supposed to have been removed to the Church, where the ingenious Chatterton discovered them. A monumental stone, with the following epitaph, was erected after the battle of Trafalgar, in honor of a few philanthropic individuals, whose lives were spent for the benefit of mankind ; and as it occupies a con spicuous place in the chapel, it may prove acceptable to our readers ; '\u2022 John Howard, Jonas Han way, John Fothergi.il, M. D. John Thornton, Richard Reynolds, Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name be the glory. Beneath some ample hallow'd dome, The warrior's bones are laid ; And blazon'd on the stately tomb, His martial deeds displey'd, Beneath an humbler roof we place This monumental stone, To names the poor shall ever bless, And Charity shall own."], [210, "188 To softon human woe, their care, To feel its sigh, to aid its prayer ; Their work on eaitb not to destroy, And their reward their Master's joy.\" We cannot omit to mention, that about four years since, at the back of the altar-piece was discovered, beneath the floor of a parlour, a most beautiful Saxon Tessilated pavement, in a high state of preservation ; the colours even now are exceedingly bright, and the whole are meant to designate the armorial bearings of eminent Catholics; the arms of one Cardinal Pope are very distinct, though the eardoni has been extinct for many hundred years. Impressions of several have been taken by the King's Herald at Arms, Sir George Neyler. This was formerly, beyond all doubt, the Chancel of the Chapel. Robert and Nicholas Thome, who founded and endowed the principal grammar-school in this city, were natives of it, and blessed with plentiful fortunes, and with liberal and benevolent minds. Tobias Mathews, archbishop of York, was born on Bristol-bridge. He was a very noted, frequent, and eloquent preacher. He kept an exact account of all the sermons he preached, by which it appears that when dean of Durham he preached 721 ; when bishop of that diocese 550 ; and when archbishop, 721 ; in all 1992. He presented to the citizens of Bristol many books towards forming a library, \" for the use of al dermen and shopkeepers, and died 1628. Dr. William Thomas, bishop of Worcester, was the son of John Thomas, linen-draper, on Bristol bridge, and born 1613. He was educated at St. John's college, Oxford, deprived of his living by the parliament in 1644, and made bishop of Worcester in 1683. He refused to publish king James's declaration for liberty of conscience, and also to take the oaths to king William, and while preparing to leave his palace and bishopric, died in the 76th year of his age. Edward Colston, esq. was born here, 1636, lived in Small-street, where he was a very successful mer chant, never insured a ship, and never lost one, and"], [211, "189 acquired a very large fortune, the principal part of which he expended in doing good. Having been chosen to represent this city in parliament, and his business in London increasing, he removed thither. He sent \u201e\u00a33000 at one time, by a private hand, to free the debtors in Ludgate. At another time he sent \u00ab\u00a3l000 to relieve the poor at Whitechapel. He annu ally freed debtors confined for small debts in White chapel prison and the Marshalsea; and twice a week had a quantity of beef drest, which with the broth, was distributed to all the poor around him. ln his more advauced years he lived a retired and devotional life, at Mortlake in Surry. His partiality and great bene* factions to Bristol are well known : and notwith standing all his public donations, he left more than \u00a3100,000 among his relations and dependants. What adds greatly to his character is, that he performed hit principal works of charity in his life and health ; he delighted in beneficence, was an excellent and eminent example to the opulent of posterity. Sir William Draper, was the son of a custom-house officer of this port, who placed him under the Rev. Mr. Bryant, master of the cathedral grammar schooL He performed with great conduct and resolution the reductiou of the Manilla and Phillippine islands in 1762, and was created knight of the bath. He lived afterwards some years at Clifon, and engaged in a Controversy with the celebrated Junius in defence of the Marquis of Granby, and shewed himself as able at the pen as the sword. He left Clifton and lived at Bath, from which place he removed to London, where he died. Thomas Chatterton, whose life has been so parti cularly delineated and scrutinized by various authors. was born on the 20th of November, in the year 1752. His father was sexton of Redcliff church, which office had been performed by his ancestors for many pre vious years. Thomas the subject hereof, was a pos thumous child, his father dying about three month* before he was born. Thus he was deprived by the premature loss of his father of that careful attention"], [212, "190 which would, without doubt, have conducted his early years through ail the difficulties that circum stances or disposition might oppose to the attainment of knowledge : and by the unpromising aspect of his infant faculties he was excluded a seminary, which might have afforded otherwise considerable advan tages ; for incredible as it may appear, yet true it is, that Thomas Chatterton, who has attracted univer sally the notice of the world from his literary accom plishments, was, at the age of five years, remanded to his mother as too dull to learn, and incapable of improvement ! His mother then taught him to read from an old black-lettered Bible ; and when he was about eight years of age he was admitted in Colston's charity-school, is St. Augustine's place. Here he resided the first three years without any particular notice, and perhaps without effort. His sister, in deed, remarks, that he very early discovered a thirst for pre-eminence, and that even when extremely young, was accustomed to preside over his playmates. At this school several of the elder boys were fond of composing verses ; but it does not appear that Chat terton was any thing more than a spectator of their poetical contests. About his tenth year he acquired a taste for reading ; and out of the trifle, which was allowed him for pocket-money, began to hire books from a circulating library. His spirits were uneven, and he was frequently lost in contemplation, seldom joining in the sports of his school-fellows, but retir ing to read. Between his eleventh and twelfth year, he wrote a catalogue of the books he had read, to the amount of 70. There are some circumstances which argue that about this time he did not fail to exercise himself in composition ,\u2022 but Mr. Thistlewaite, who was intimately acquainted with him, says that he never attempted a single couplet during the first three years of their acquaintance. Yet allowing him to be the author of the pieces attributed to Rowley, Mr. Thistlewaite must have been mistaken, as he relates himself that Chatterton, during the summer of 1764, produced a MS. on parchment, which Mr. T. says,"], [213, "191 he was confident was Elenore and Juga, Chatterton was then about 12 years old. On the 1st of July, 1767, he left the Charity-school, and was bound an apprentice to Mr. John Lambert, attorney of Bristol, for seven years, to learn the art of a scrivener. Here he was employed in copying, the whole of the day ; and his hours of leisure, his master had good reason to suppose were spent generally with his mother. In the beginning of October, 1768, the new bridge at Bristol was finished : at that time there appeared in Farley's Bristol Journal an account of the ceremonies on opening the old bridge, introduced by a letter to the printer, intimating that \" The following descrip tion of the Friars first passing over the old bridge was taken from an ancient manuscript,\" and signed Dun helmus Bristoliensis. The paper, if it be allowed to be a frabrication of modern times, demonstrates strong powers of invention, and an uncommon knowledge of ancient customs. So singular a memoir could not fail to exite curiosity, and many persons became anxious to see the original. The printer could give no account of it, nor of the person who brought the copy ; but after much inquiry, it was discovered that the manuscript was brought by a youth between 15 aud 16 years of age, of the name of Thomas Chatter ton. This was the first time any of these excellent compositions were made public. The account of the discovery of certain parchments in Redcliff church by the father of Chatterton is well known as well as the manner in which that youth is said to have preceived the value of their contents. However about this time Chatterton acquired th* notice of Mr. Catcott, who introduced him to Mr. Barrett, who received the pieces be communicated ; but it is apprehended that he seldom remunerated the indigent youth as he ought to have done. Chat terton's attention while at Bristol was not confined to Rowley; his pen was exercised in a variety of pieces, chiefly satyrical, and several essays, both in prose and verse, he sent to the magazines. He early conceived a disgust for his profession,"], [214, "192 and made many efforts to extricate himself from this anti-poetical situation; the most remarkable, and which evidently from its failure, led to his untimely end, was his application to the honorable H. Walpoie. This gentleman, at first, treated him in a civil man ner, and wrote an answer to his letters, couched in very polite terms ; but afterwards understanding that he was poor and low in the world, instead of gene rously stretching forth his arm to lift him from his obscure condition, he treated him with indifference and unmerited neglect. Mr. Walpoie, sometime after the death of his unfortunate applicant, endeavoured to justify his mode of conduct, which hunanity and a christian benevolence will undoubtedly pronounce unjustifiable. In his pretended and puritanical vin dication of his behaviour to Chatterton he reminds one of a certain god belonging to the Egyptians, that weeps while it destroys. Of Mr. Walpole's conduct, it may be farther remarked, in spite of every servile expression of literary sycophants, that in detaining the youth's M.S. after the correspondence between them, was the height of insolence and barbarity. A mind of common generosity would be particularly careful not to give pain to the unhappy, when it might easily be avoided. A being, indeed of a superior order of virtue, would be religiously tenacious of answering more expeditiously the letter of a poor than a rich man ; that the mind of the former might not possibly be wounded with the apprehension that he was despised. But this doctrine to Mr. W. would have been like a desertation on colours delivered to a man born blind. Being flattered by the booksellers in London, Chat terton was induced to proceed to the metropolis; but although he most nobly exerted himself, and by every effortof his undoubted genius and skill, endeavoured to live, he at last fell a victim to the keen and bitter pangs of poverty, and overwhelmed with despair, sunk into the arms of death, on the 24th of August, 1770, when he wanted but a few months to complete his eighteenth year."], [215, "193 The great and distinguished praises which have been repeatedly bestowed upon Chatterton, are to be considered as just in every respect, if he his allowed to be the author of Rowley, which the generality of critics assert ; but as to his acknowledged productions, although truly excellent for such a youth, and under such unfavourable circumstances, they do not deserve the unqualified panegyrics afforded by all persons of sensibility on the pieces under the signature of Tho mas Rowley. Agreeing that he composed the old poems himself, he must certainly be considered as a young man of the most extensive mental faculties, which, in consequence of the want of patronage and proper support being granted to him, were, by a premature dissolution, at once prevented from rising to that degree of excellence and vigour likely to have increased with his years. May this be a warning to future Walpoles ! Too proud for pity, and too poor for praise, No voice to cherish, and no hand to raise : Torn, stung, and sated with this mortal coil, This weary, anxious scene of fruitless toil ; Not all the graces that to youth belong, Not all the energies of sacred song; Nor al! that Fancy, all that Genius gave, Gould snatch his wounded spirit from the graves And tho' no lofty vase orsculptur'd bust Bends o'er the sod that hides his hallow'd dusf 5 Tho' no long line of ancestry betrays The pride of relatives, or pomp of praise ; Tho' o'er bis name a blushing nation rears Oblivions wing \u2014 lo hide reflection's tears; Still shall his verse in dazzling lustre live, And claim a brighter wreath than wealth Can give. Mr. James Thistlewaite, a native of this city, before mentioned as a contemporary with Chatterton, has been the author of several novels and poems, and Various other miscellaneous productions. Mrs. Ann Yearsley, a favorite child of nature, whose genius and mental powers have distinguished her as a literary character. Her publications, mostly Cc"], [216, "194 poetic, are numerous and pleasing proofs of her good sense and large benevolence. They who have had the pleasure of her conversation, have found that her judgment was as sound as her heart was good. Mrs. Yearsley once kept a circulating library, at the Colo nade, near to the Hotwell. She is now dead. The following lines, addressed to the Avon, will suffici ently prove her intellectual capacity : afoirressa to tfce abort, BY MRS.

His education was not extensively liberal, but his efforts to improve his intellectual faculties were successful, and he left not a moment unemployed to remedy the deficiency. He was occupied in a"], [218, "196 counting-house in the day ; and the hours relaxation from business or sleep, he devoted to study. He wrote several truly poetical pieces, which will be read with pleasure. He died the 26th of December, 1806, and lies buried in St. Michaels church-yard. John Dawes Worgan, was born on the 8lh of November, 1791. With a superiority of mind, he was fortunately situated so as to afford it cultivation. He was earnest in his pursuit of knowledge, but died of a consumption, at the age of nineteen, when his prospects of literary honors were bright and flou rishing. His disposition seems to have been pious and filial. His poems, &c. are published by Hayley, and will present a pleasing picture of his genius and education.

Robert Southey, esq. poet-laureat, was born in Bristol. He has written several ingenious and useful poetical as well as prose works. His style is peculiar, and his scenes are generally romantic and gloomy, but there is a sort of grandeur and simplicity com bined in his productions, as cause them to be greatly admired. Mr. Wdliam Sewell kept a seminary at Clifton, where his scientific and rational mode of instruction clearly pointed out his value as a christian classical teacher. He wrote against the pernicious works of Thomas Paine : he has re-published, among numerous excellent works, \" The mirror for the Times.\" He still resides in Bristol. Rev. S.

GLORIA DEO I"], [221, "CHAP. XX. THE HOTWELLS. Its Situation, Ancient Use, Nature and Properties of the Waters; its particular virtue and efficacy in vari- ous disorders. Contiguous buildings and hotels. THE warm spring or fountain called the Hotwell, is about a quarter of a mile westward from the liber ty or boundary of Bristol, in the parish of Clifton, on the Glocestershire side of the river Avon. Near to the bottom of the cliffs, on the eastern side of the river, a about 26 feet below high water mark, and 10 feet above low water, this salutary fluid rises forcibly out of an aperture in tbe solid rock. Such an excel lent spring, so warm, and so copious as to discharge (according to the best accounts) 40 gallons in a minute, could not escape the notice of our ancestors, and especially of the sailors, who in such a well-fre quented port, were so often sailing up and down the river, and who had eyes to descern, and knew heat from cold, as well as their successors. The know ledge of this spring must have been coeval with the population of the country, and the navigation of the Avon. Of this we have every possible proof from history and tradition. The very earliest topographer of Bristol, William of Worcester, who wrote in 1480, mentions it twice in his book, page 185, \" Fons ibidem in parte de Ghyston Cliff, in fundo aqu\u00e6, et est ita callidus, sicut lac, vel aqua Badonis;\" which may bear the"], [222, "200 following translation : In the same place is a fountain, on the side of Ghyston Clift towards the bottom of the river, and it is so warm as milk, is like the water of Bat h. And again, page 233, \" Fons callidus eraanat de pro- fundo aquae Avyn, sicutest Bathoni\u00e6,\" The Hot-well flows out of the river Avon, and is like the water of Bath, For the reader will be pleased to observe, that on its immediate efflux from the rock, the water is much warmer than when pumped up for drinking ; and also, that it feels and tastes warmer in Winter than in Summer, and in very cold days it heats the glass into which it falls from the cock. There have been various traditions concerning the uses of this water, both internally and externally ; all of them represent it as having been much frequented, and applied, externally, for scorbutic complaints, and for cleansing and healing sores : and that sailors, particularly, availed themselves of its sanative qua lities. In the former part of the last century it was resorted to for various disorders, cutaneous and in ternal. There had been anciently a reservoir of brick made for it ; and thus it remained 'till that century was nearly elapsed. The drinking of Mineral waters was so much out of fashion and practice before the revolution, that the super-excellent water of Bath was almost universally disused, 'till the year 1691, when Mr. George Long was so miraculously cured of a constitution broken with the gout and stone. The fame of this cure brought crowds to Bath, to drink its water as art alterative, balsamic, and strengthening medicine. But before the last mentioned period, the virtues of the mild and healing spring at Bristol becoming more gennerally known, and its reputation and uses at tracting more patients, strangers as well as residents; the corporation of this city had taken upon them to provide for the convenience of visitants, and for the reception and use of the water. In 1661, the sum of \u00a3100 was issued out of the chamber, by order of council, to make the way from the city, by Rownham, passable for coaches and horses to the Hotwell."], [223, "201 About 1680 the Hotwell water was rendered famous by being found a specific in Diabetes ; owing it is said, to the cure of Mr. \\Ym. Gugg, a baker, of Bristol, who being reduced by that disease to the greatest ex tremity so that his life was dispaired of, he dreamed that he drank plentifully of this water, and was much refreshed by it. He soon procured some of it to quench his thirst; and after using it a few days, he recovered and came abroad cured, to the surprise of his acquaintance. Dr. Randolph, in his treatise on this water, attri butes its first reputation to its known efficacy in tbe stone and gravel. In 1691, Sir John Knight, mayor of Bristol, to prevent the tide from mixing with the spring, raised a work of stone around it, higher than the tide ever rose, but the weight of the water inclos ed, endangered the loss of the spring by altering its course, ln 1695, the company of Merchants of Bris tol, who are Lords of the manor of Clifton, granted a lease for building to Sir Thomas Day, Robert Yeates, and Thomas Callowhill, esqrs. and several other citi zens, who recovered the spring, erected the Hotwell house, made proper foundations for pumps,- which raised the water 30 feet high, and contrived pipes, through which the waste water of the spring might run into the river : in these pipes are valves which open to let the water out, but shut when the river water is coming in. It has been asserted that the spring is often affected by the rising of the tides : but when we consider the copious supply, at the rate of 40 gallons per minute, it certainly can have no sensible effect on the quality of the water. Many experiments have been made by several eminent physicians to discover the distinguishing properties of this water. It is natural to suppose, that in its subterraneous passage through the rocks, over different strata and among such a variety of mineral and other substances, it must be impregnated with their several virtues. In the common spring water of the neighbouring Rock-house, Fahrenheit's Dd"], [224, "202 thermometer stood at 50 degrees, the water at the Hotwell taken immediately from the pump raised it to 76; and as the heat of a person in health seldom ex ceeds the degree of 96, it follows that the Bristol water is little more than three fourths of the human heat. The learned Doctors \u2014 Brooks, Sutherland, Ran dolph, Keir, Lucas, Rutty, Monro, Berkenhout, and others, have largely treated on this excellent water; fiom their labours and our own observation, we shall introduce a few necessary particulars concerning its properties and uses. When received into a glass from the spring, it appears sparkling, and abounding with air bubbles, which rise from the bottom and sides to the surface, as if it were in a state of fermen tation ; and is also of a whitish color, which gradually goes off as it grows cold, nor can any degree of heat ever after rise it to a similar color. And therefore, they who would have it in perfection, should drink it at the spring, when it has a delicate, soft, milky taste, beyond that of tny other medicinal water that is known in England. It appears perfectly pellucid ; and though it. is so warm and soft to the taste, it is in realityr hard, and will not dissolve soap equably', but curdle it into white masses. It will not wash linen, or extract the virtue of tea as well as common water; but after exposure to the air, for about three weeks or longer, it will answer these purposes full as well. It leaves a sensation of dryness on the pal ate, is perfectly without smell, pleasing and grateful to the stomach, cooling and quenches thirst. Dr. Berkenhout, in his outlines of the Natural History of Britain and Ireland, vol. 3, page 92, gives this account of Bristol Water. \"It rises Fahrenheit's thermomeier to 80. Lighter than rain-water. Con tains, in small proportion, Glauber salts, Epsom salts, calcareous earth, and fixed air.\" Dr. Higgins, one of the first lecturers and teachers of chemistry in London, having been at great pains particularly to analyze this water, has found that a \\Vinchester gallon contains,"], [225, "203 Of calcareous earth combined wiih vitriolic acid in tbe ) dut'.grs. form of selenite, - . . . . i gr' Calcareous earth combined with acidulous gas - - . 1 12_ Warine salt of magnesia ------.0 54 Sea salt --------- 0 6\u00a3 2 9 And that it moreover contains eight ounce measures of acidulous gas, beyond the quantity retained by the calcareous earth in the heat of boiling water ; and two ounce measures of air, equal, if not superior to atmospheric air in purityr. According to the more recent analysis of Dr. Car- rick, about the year 1797, a wine gallon of 231 cubic inches of the Hotwell water is found to contain, grs. Of muriate of magnesia --\u2022-... 7Z Muriate of soda \u2022--..... 4 Sulphate of soda ... ..... ]]\u00a3 Sulphate of lime ....... . ]JJ Carbonate of lime ....... . 13{ Making together of solid matt r ..... 472 Carbonic and gas .... 30 cubic inches Common atmospheric air ... 3 Making together of gaseous fluids ... 33 cubic inches. But whatever the substances are that impregnate it, it is plain that there is nothing of a corruptible nature in it. It receives no taint through length of time, or alteration of climate, but retains its purity in whatever part of the world it is sent to, which occasions a great and continual demand for it abroad, so that it may now be procured in most foreign countries. This water is equally warm, good and salutary at all times in the year, Winter as well as Summer; and there are many considerable persons and families who have made the Hotwells or Clifton their stated places of residence for the benefit of drinking it; therefore, they who wish to try and experience its virtues, need not delay 'till Spring or Summer, but immediately have recourse to this healing fountain."], [226, "204 When we consider how agreeable this water is to sight, smell, and taste, how clear, pure, and soft ; its gentle degree of heat, so adapted to various diseases. and the many cures wrought by it on those who pru dently apply to it in time, it appears that it has an undoubted title to a place in tbe first class of medi cinal waters. It has been recommended when it cannot be drank at the fountain head, to place the bottle in which it is contained, in a pan or basin filled with tepid water for a few seconds before drawing the cork, in order to raise it to nearly its natural temperature of 76 degrees : thus it is rendered more agreeable to the taste, and its virtues have greater powers of exertion. The celebrated uses of the Bristol Hotwell water are to temper a hot acrimonious blood, to palliate or cure consumptions, weakness of the lungs, hectic fevers and heals. It is successfully prescribed in uterine and other internal h\u00e6morrages and in inflam mations ; in spitting of blood, dysentery, immoderate flux of the menses, in the fluor albus, and purulent ulcers of the viscera. It is of great use in old diar rh\u0153as, in gleets, and especially in the diabetes, for which it. is particularly extolled ; and in other cases where the secretions are too much increased, and the humors too thin; in the stone and gravel, and the stranguary ; in colliquative sweats, in nervous atrophy, in scorbutic and rheumatic cases, in colics, the gout, loss of appetite and indigestion, in the ve nereal disease, and both internally and externally in cancers, and the king's evil. Doctor Keir observes, \" It has been found that consumptions, even in their last stages, when the ob structed part of the lungs were come to suppuration, and an ulcer was manifest, when the body was wasted almost to a skeleton, when nocturnal sweats were profuse, and even colliquative diarrh\u0153as were com mon, that a sudden stop has been put to the rapid career, the symptoms gradually mitigated, and a re covery at last obtained by the regular and long con tinued use of the water and a strict milk diet.\" And"], [227, "205 in scorbutic and convulsive cholics, spasms, and con vulsions, the doctor informs us, that the water has succeeded beyond imagination. Concerning the dia betes, he observed, \"Among all the remidies hitherto recommended for the cure of a diabetes, none comes up to the medicinal water of Bristol ; this of late years has been reputed almost a specific in this distemper, and certainly not without reason, since daily expe rience proclaims the truth.\" And further he informs us that \" In general, the use of these waters is both innocent and safe, notwithstanding their powerful virtues : the patients, in most cases, may drink freely of them, and without reserve ; and though it is not always so, yet if any one will venture without direc tions, I know of no medicinal water, in the use of which a person may, with less risque, be his own physician.\" The water is drank by visitants, principally in the Spring, Summer, and Autumn. In these seasons, particularly in the Summer, there are, undoubtedly, more opportunities, and better conveniences for the free enjoyment of the air, and for the use of exercise, which, in many disorders greatly contribute to the cure. But the salubrious air of the Hotwells and Clifton, aswell as the water both so benificial and strengthening to the constitution, have induced many to fix their abode in these pleasant situations. Medical preparations for drinking this water are not always necessary : in general it may safely be ventured on by the visitant. In very tender consti tutions, and difficult cases, it will be highly improper that the patient should agitate his frame by vomits or any pr\u00e6ternatural evacuations. The diet should be regulated according to the degree of strength and the state of the stomach, and the salutary effects of the water calmly and patiently expected. The usual method of taking the water, is to go to the pump-room in the morning and drink a glass of it, which contains half a pint, and then to sit down with the company about half an hour. For those who prefer exercise to sitting, there is the Colonade with"], [228, "206 shops, built beneath the rocks, and a parade about 800 feet long, shaded with trees, by the side of the river, so that the company may enjoy a dry and plea sant walk when it rains, or an airy, cool, and shady walk in the warmest season : also during the influx and efflux of the river, they may be entertained with the sight of the Merchant's ships, Steam packets, and Coasting vessels that generally pass up or down. When the half-hour is expired, another glass may be drank; and, at about five o'clock in the afternoon, the same quantity to be repeated. This is to be con tinued for the first two or three days, after which the water may be increased to three glasses before break fast, staying some proper time between each, and to as many in the afternoon. These six glasses a day are generally the quantity drank by each person while remaining at the Hot wells, which is so far from being thought a task that it is done with pleasure, the water being so relieving, grateful, and pleasant to the taste. The Season at the Hotwells and Clifton commences in March and April, and continues till October. The NEW HOTWELL HOUSE is built against the rock, near the site of the old one, in the Tuscan order, and is a handsome structure of Bath stone ; it has an octagon frout, and a piazza on each side. The ground-floor contains a large Pump-Room, ele gantly adorned, and convenient hot and cold baths; and on the upper part are good sitting-rooms. In the front isa carriage road, properly defended from the river by a wall. The Hotwell-house and Spring is kept by Mr. Moreton, who pays every attention to tbe Nobility and Gentry who attend for the use of this celebrated Water.

It is earnestly recommended to those having tender lungs and delicate frames, not to delay an application to the remedies which bountiful nature presents in this place, till it be too late ; and also to the gentle men of the Faculty not to detain their consumptive patients under their treatment till their cases become desperate, but to send them in time, when perhaps the water and air of the Hotwells may yet have a chance to perfect their cure. And now, Hotwell. on thee my muse would fain Bestow a ponion of her humble strain: Salubrious fountain ! how can language tell What wond'rous virtue in thy waters dwell ? When dire consumption, with corroding sway, Afflicts the fair, and makes their bloom decay. Thy healing stream invigorates their souls, The monster baffles, and its rage controuls; Once more resiores them to their lover's arms, Replete with health, and fraught with blooming charms. Dear valued fount ! to distant countries Fame Hath loudly borne thy much-distinguish'd name : To distant countries is thy wave consign'd, In copious floods to benefit mankind. Thorne. WARNE's HOTEL and BALL- ROOMS, (late Barton's) a short distance from Rownham. These Rooms are rendered eligible and elegant by Mr. Warne, who has made several improvements in his Hotel, and his Coffee-Room we pronounce to be the handsomest in the west of England. On the northern side over the Ball Rooms is a lofty house, in which are many spacious and airy dining, sitting, and bed rooms, which command delightful propects of the river, the hills, and country. The Assembly room is 90 feet long and 35 wide, and 35 high : has glass chandeliers, and a music gallery. Near the Hotel are excellent stabling for horses and good coach houses. This Hotel is admirably situated for its nearness to Cumberland Basin, or entrance to the harbour, where the Steam packets and other vessels arrive, being well"], [230, "208 calculated to accommodate those families who arrive and leave by steam conveyance. HARRIS'S HOTEL, a new, and convenient build ing at the end of Caroline place, and fronting the Locks of Cumberland Basin, where there is every accommodation for travelling families, and an excel lent prospect of the surrounding country. At the Hotwells whole houses may be taken by the week, month, or year, handsomely furnished ; and lodgings may also be obtained at reasonable rates, combining comfort, convenience, and great attention. The dwellings which generally receive the noble and polite visitants, are, the Hotwell-House ; St. Vin cent's Parade, a range of elegant houses fronting the river; Paradise-row; Warne's and Harris's Hotels; Dowry-square and parade ; Chapel-row ; Albemarle row ; Hope-square ; Granby-place, &c. in all of which are good Lodging-houses, some of them built in an elegant style, and ornamental to the situation. The town called the Hotwells, or more properly St. Vincent's, has been greatly improved within a few years. The society of merchants, who are lords of the manor, and proprietors of the Hotwell, latterly have made great improvements, and such as will prove highly beneficial to the visitants and residents of this desirable situation, reflecting honor on them selves as a body of respectable gentlemen. The first of these Improvements, is, the taking down of the old Hotwell-house, and building a new one as already noticed. Secondly, having effected a Carriage road in its front, passing below the rocks by the side of the river, and ascending by a gradual slope to Clifton down, a little below where the turn pike formerly stood, where a new Turnpike-house has been built ; this road leads on to Durdnam-down, Westbury, Henbury, &c. and forms a ride of unri valled beauty and magnificence. And thirdly, a few yards beyond the Hotwell-house commences a Ser pentine Gravel Walk up the Rocks to Clifton ; this is an easy ascent and affords a sublime prospect of the Rocks and Woods."], [231, "209 There are at the Hotwells and also at Clifton, neat Pony Cars and Donkies for riding, which may be hired at any time of the day. The Downs being so near to the Wells and Clifton afford some of the finest rides imaginable, having in view the river Avon to Ihe Severn, and beyond to the mountains of Wales. The cool and refreshing breezes from tbe sea on these downs, cannot fail to strengthen those of weak con stitution. Those whose strength will permit, may sail down the river in boats, and when accompanied with music, which is echoed and re-echoed by the rocks, have a most delightful effect ; they may sail down as far as Portishead, take cold collations with them, and dine in the woods, which are shady, rural and pleasant : from whence there are views of the Bristol channel, Steep and Flat Holmes, the opposite Welch moun tains, and adjacent country. On the 1st of November, 1755, the Hotwell Water suddenly became very red, and so extremely turbid that it could not be drank. All conjectures concern* ing the cause of this phenomena were then in vain. In a few days the news of the earthquake at Lisbon gave a dreadful solution to enquiries concerning tbe change in the water, which ran foul a long time be fore it recovered its former purity. On the same day, the water of a well in a field belonging to Mr. John Harrison, near St. George's Church in Kingswood, which had been remarkably clear, became suddenly as black as ink, and conti nued unfit for use nearly a fortnight. Such a dread ful and extensive commotion was on that day in the bowels of the earth, and in the sea, that its effects were perceived, with astonishment, at Milford-haven, various parts of the Bristol Channel, and in the river Avon, whose tide, then ebbing, was driven back, and flowed upwards for some small time. The eruption was only at devoted Lisbon, the greater part of which was laid in tremendous and awful ruin ! E B"], [232, "CHAP. XXI. Of St. Vincent's Rocks ; the Bristol Stones ; Clifton, its Buildings, principal Mansions, Rooms and Hotels; Sion Spring, or upper Hotwell; the saline Mineral Spa, its Properties and Effects. BETWEEN Rownham and the Hotwell house, rise on each side of the river, a magnificent range of Rocks, which are not more remarkable for their height than for their being equally so on each side ofthe river; the strata in some places answering on each side for about one mile and a half in a serpentine course. These constitute some of the greatest natural curiosi ties in England. The Rock beyond the Hotwell, and on the same side, is named St. Vincent's, on the highest part of which was formerly a Chapel, dedi cated to that Saint, who was a native of Spain, and suffered marterdom at Valencia, A. D. 305 ; therefore the Spring was called St. Vincent's Well. The chapel was standing in the time of William of Worcester, who describes it as being twenty-seven feet long, and nine feet broad. The grand Rock of St. Vincent, which is 300 feet high, furnishes the Natural Philosopher with many curious fossils ; the Botanist with some scarce plants ; the Antiquarian with the remains of a Roman camp, and the less curious inquirer with a view of the most astonishing and dreadful precipiece. The rocks are generally, when broken up, of a dusky red, brown, or chocolate-coloured marble, very 'hard and close grained, and on being struck with a hammer, emit a strong sulphureous scent. This stone will bear a polish equal to any foreign marble, and when sawed"], [233, "211 into slabs and polished, it appears beautifully varie gated with veins of white, bluish-grey, or yellow. It makes excellent lime, for which purpose there is not any stone in England so good as this, nor is there any lime so strong, fine and white. Most spectators of these rocks are of opinion that they were once united, and were separated by some terrible convul. sion of nature. A few lines from Mr. Thome's Bris tolia, may be suitably inserted here. But yonder, tow'ring o'er the swelling tide, St. Vincent's far-fam'd, awful rocks, abide! Heav'ns! what tremendous precipiects, there, Exalt iheir heads, and shoot into she air ! Say, craggy rocks, what xude convulsion tore These clifts from those on yon adjacent -hore ? You look as though, in ages past, you'd been In contact close, without a gulph between. In the fissures and cavities of the rocks, are found these fine chrystalsj called Bristol Stones, or dia monds, some of which are eo hard as to cut glass, are exceedingly clear, colourless and brilliant ; and when set in rings in their natural state, have appeared of as high a polish and lustre as if they had been wroughtby the most skilful lapidary. It will be proper to observe to the purchasers of clusters of stones, apparently chrystal, that are sold at the shops, that many of them are nothing better than spar, and much softer than the true Bristol stones, which will cut glass, and bear the fire and aqua-fortis without alteration ; but glass breaks the spar, aqua fortis corrodes it, and fire calcinates it into lirae. Also the shoots of spar are triangular, or pentangu lar, but those of chrystals are hexagonal and termi nate in a point. . Words fail to express the grandeur and richness of the scenes, rocks, trees, shrubs, flowers, herbs, plants, and productions of this incomparably plea sant and healthy part of the country. The ground on which we tread abounds with aromatic plants, and their refreshing fragrance inspires new life, health, and cheerfulness \u2022, the ear is delighted witt*"], [234, "212 the melodious notes, and with the morning and even ing songs of a thousand feathered songsters, the eye gratified and the senses charmed, and the valetudi narian once more enjoys the blessings of incipient ease and vigour. CLIFTON is indubitably one of the most pleasant, healthy, and elegant villages of the kingdom. Its air is so remarkably pure, salubrious, and restorative, that it has been long ago, and by various authors, stiled the Montpelier of England. It commands a pleasing prospect over the western part of the city, and of the Avon, which, when full, and vessels are sailing up or down, add much to the beauty of the view. On the opposite shore, the agreeable, well cultivated and wholesome part of Somersetshire, com pletes the landscape. This rises, gradually, for five miles, from the river, to the top of Dundry-hill, on wrhich is a church with a lofty tower, that may be seen from all the surrounding eminences. As the delightful situation of Clifton has, long since, in duced many opulent persons and families to make it their principal residence, the continual new acces sions of inhabitants have occasioned the hill to be almost covered with elegant piles of building, and separate mansions, such as few villages can show. We shall here particularize the principal buildings, in all of which are houses elegantly furnished for the reception of families; who maybe accommodated with a whole house or apartments, by the week, month, or year. The Royal York Crescent, fronting the south-east, has 52 noble houses, and a paved parade near 20 feet wide, inclosed with iron rails, forms a delightful walk, and fine prospect. A carriage road below, and a meadow, separate this and the Lower Crescent, which is nearly as extensive as the Upper, but not yet finished. Near to this, is Windsor Ter race, an elegant building of eleven houses, which has the look of one entire mansion, built to the edge of the rock, and has a sublime appearance from below ; a little above is Paragon Buildings, in tbe form of a crescent ; and next to this is Prince's Buildings, six*"], [235, "213 teen houses, the back of which has a delightful view of the rocks and scenery below, and tbe Hotwells ; on the entrance to Clifton Down, is Glocester Row, and Beaufort Buildings, and opposite Harley Place ; between these buildings is a pleasant, extensive, and much frequented walk, ornamented with stately fir trees and a shrubbery ; near to this is Rodney Place, and Boyce's Buildings. Also to the north of the church are many fine buildings, cottages, and villas, particularly Richmond Terrace, an extensive pile elevated above the road, and fronting three sides, and has about 40 elegant houses : on the north-west side of this building is a road which leads to Durd ham Down, and in the grounds adjoining, is Mr. Cur tin's Nursery, recently laid out, which Nursery adds greatly to the prospect of that side of the Terrace. Clifton and York Places, have many fine houses ; excellent piles of building are in a great state of forwardness in the fields leading from Tyndall's Park gate to Richmond Terrace, one of these is nam ed Maridian Place, some of the houses are already occupied. At the top of Park-street by the side of Tyndall's Park, a good road leads to Vittoria place, and many elegant villas ; next to White Ladies' turnpike ; from thence to the foot of the Down are on each side of the road, the extensive Nurseries of Mr. John Miller, which has lately undergone great improvements, and adds to the beauty of this part of the vicinity, on the left of the road is a well finished pile of Building called King's Parade ; at Durdham-down also, are many good houses, some of which are let to visitants. About the centre of Clifton is the Mall ; this is two elegant piles of building, containing 26 houses \"with freestone fronts, opposite and perfectly similar at the distance of 130 feet from each other, and in this space is a beautiful shrubbery ; the s'outh-western end is open to the fields ; Clifton Hotel, and build ings corresponding in architecture, exhibit great ele gance of taste, and form the north-eastern side. \u2014 We shall here describe the Hotels ; first,"], [236, "214 THE CLIFTON HOTEL, (late Mangeon's) with the Assembly and Ball-Rooms is now kept by Mr. James Bubtt. The following are the accommodations : \u2014 The front consists of three elegant and costly rooms, the centre of which is the Ball Room, about 50 feet in length and a proportionate breadth, richly orna mented, and furnished in a style not inferior to any in England ; adorned with glass chandeliers and lus tres, rich drapery, &c. ; the doors mahogany. On one side is the Card, and on the other the Tea Room, decorated and furnished in a style equal to the former, and separated only by large folding-doors, which, when thrown open (as they are occasionally), form an extensive suit for the Public Subscription Assemblies ; afford every accommodation combined with the most polite, genteel and fashionable amusements. In this extensive Hotel these are about twenty sit ting rooms, and seventy bed rooms, which are fitted up in a grandeur seldom witnessed ; indeed we pro nounce them equal, if not superior to those of any hotel in the United Kingdom ; and the different offi ces are so well calculated to answer their purposes, as to render it in every respect fit for the residence of the nobility and gentry during their stay at this place of fashionable resort, as it is, without ex ception the most elevated and delightful spot in Clifton. Near to the hotel are dry, secure and commodious coach houses and good stabling for horses. The business of the late Royal York Hotel, which was in Glocester row, having been purchased by Mr. Mangeon, deceased, those premises are now private dwellings. It is but justice here to remark, in contradiction to some reports circulated respecting the charges, in every respect, at this hotel, that, in point of attention, accommodation, and moderate terms, it ranks first in estimation with all who have therein taken up their abode."], [237, "215 THE BATH HOTEL, near Glocester Row, and fronting the Rocks, is kept by Mr. Thomas Ander son ; at this Hotel are excellent accommodations, and from its apartments are delectable views of the rocks and opposite woods. Clifton bids fair to become a fine town, and parti cularly by the addition of a large and elegant church lately built, as we have already noticed, in page 132, and with the buildings below, constitute a sort of Westminster and Court-end to Bristol ; it being duly to the west of this ancient city. In Nelson place, nearTBoyce's Buildings, is a neat building with freestone front, built by subscription of some Gentlemen of Clifton, in which are Billiard, Card, and Reading Rooms. At the entrance of Clifton Down is a good house that belonged to the late Sir William Draper, who erected, at the western part of the garden, before the front, an obelisk of freestone, with a short Latin in scription on its base, to the late Earl of Chatham : and on the eastern side, a Cenotaph with Latin verses and an English inscription, to the memory of those departed warriors, who fell in various battles and sieges in the East-Indies ; at Madras, Pondicherry, and Manilla ; with the names of officers, and list of the battles. This house is now the residence of William Miles, esq. who has made great improve ments, by erecting in its front a lofty portico, in the modern gothic, which has a grand effect from the walk on the Down opposite Glocester row ; it is now called Manilla Hall. Opposite to Clifton Church is the house of Gabriel Goldney, Esq. celebrated for a curious Grotto, com posed of a vast variety of rare and costly Shells, brought from various parts of the world. The inter stices, are enriched with Bristol and other stones; different kinds of Spar, mundic, metallic ores, fossils and petrefactions. It is floored with mosaic bricks at the upper end, in a cavity, is the 'statue of a river god, leaning upon anurn, out of whiclvissues a stream of water; this runs murmuring over rough \"stones."], [238, "216 partly into the hollows of two large escallop shells, which weighs near to three hundred pounds ; from the brim of these it falls in gentle rills into a reservoir. On the opposite side to the entrance there is a repre sentation of a Lion's den, in which are the figures of a lion and lioness, as large as life, and well executed. From the grotto is a subterraneous passage to one of the first terrace walks in England ; from whence are rich and delightful prospects. The Gardens are extensive aud in excellent order. The fountains and a large pond, abounding with gold and silver fishes, are supplied with water from a well, by a steam engine. The avenues are decorated with statues, and bordered with lofty trees, which afford cooling shades in the hottest times of summer. It is recommended to the reader to visit the Roman Camp on the top of Clifton Hill, and the summit of St. Vincent's Rocks, where the remains of a wind mill now stands ; and to observe the marks of the ancient intrenchments and fortifications, where coins of the latter Roman emperors have been frequently found. A peep from the edge of the rocks into the gulph beneath never fails to excite, in a stranger, surprize, admiration, and horror. Clifton Post office is nearly opposite the eastern end of the Royal York Crescent. Deliveries are made in the morning for the Northern, \u2014 12 the London, and at 8 evening for the Western mail. Letters should be put in the Clifton office, for London and all parts a quarter before four o'clock in the afternoon. Clifton has two very respectable Circulating Libra ries, with Reading-Rooms, &c. Mr Lane's, at No. 6, Sion-place, who, for general accommodation keeps an extensive assortment of new books, stationary, perfumery, and toys. Mr. Aitkens's valuable Library, who also keeps the Sion Spring, or Upper Hotwell, and sells perfumery of all kinds. Here is a spacious pump-room, and bathing-places for those who wish to try the external as well as internal uses of the water. We shall here introduce an historical account of"], [239, "217 SION SPRING, or UPPER HOTWELL. The late Mr. Morgan, an attorney of Bristol, built a house for himself on the hill, just above the Hotwell. In this elevated and rocky situation, water was not over plenty ; and about 1796, Mr. M. was determined to sink a well on his premises, and to dig till water could be found. The miners dug and blew up the rocks till they came to the depth of 100 feet, without finding water. Mr. M. persevered in his design, and the workmen descended to the depth of 200 feet, without success. Still he ordered them to go on \u2014 \u2022 and when they had sunk to 246 feet, a copious stream gushed in upon them so suddenly and impe tuously, that had they not hastily retreated, they must have been overwhelmed by the inundation. They not only found water, but that it was warm; and their employer was agreeably surprised, to be certified, on taste and trial, that the water had simi lar qualities to that of the Lower House. It raises the thermometer to 73 degrees, though drawn up from such a profundity. Mr M. erected a steam engine to raise the water, which works everyday; built a spacious pump-room about 50 feet by 30, and prepared bathing places adjoining. Fam'd Clifton Hill ! thy various charms invite The great, the gay, the wealthy and polite ! On thee, both Health and Pleasure keep their court; To thee, old age and blooming youth resort ; Thy balmy breezes have the magic pow'r The Weak to strengthen, and the Sick restore: Who, when they find their wonted vigor fail, Fly to thy summit and imbibe thy gale, Whose ev'ry zephyr, pregnant with her charms, Hygeia. owns, and with her spirit warms. Thork. SALINE MINERAL SPA WATER, is situated below Mardyke, in the street leading from the city to the Hotwell, at the house of Mr. Davis, commonly called the Tennis-court House. It issues out of a chasm in a rock (about 20 feet under the surface of the earth) which was opened in 1787 by the present E?"], [240, "218 proprietor, in sinking a well, A gentleman of the Faculty accidentally tasting it, declared its medical qualities ; it has since been recommended by most of the Physicians in Bristol, and has, undeniably, cured many persons afflicted with various complaints. This water is perfectly transparent, an admirable mixture of the Saline and Chalybeate, with certain qualities of fixed and dephlogisticated air. It is es teemed by good judges to be superior to any other mineral water of its kind in the kingdom. It has nothing nauseous in its taste, does not deposit any thing whatsoever, and will remain transparent for any length of time in any climate. It is good in obstructions of the liver, viscera and mesenteric glands, in hypocondria, jaundice, and female complaints. It has performed wonderful cures in scrophulous, scorbutic, cutaneous, bilious and rheu matic disorders. It has healed ulcerated sore legs of many years standing ; has been efficacious in the piles, rickets, particularly pimpled faces, and in cases which have been deemed incurable by the Faculty. It sharpens the appetite, raises the spirits, and strength ens the body ; its virtues are real and great ; and are ready to be attested by those who have drank it, and have found its salutary effects by happy experience. Convenient hot and cold baths are prepared with this most excellent Saline Spring, for the reception of those who are advised by the Faculty to bathe. To those who are under a course of the Bath Waters, it is recommended, in lieu of Cheltenham Salts ; it may be procured from the Spring every day. There is a neat Pump-room in the house, and a small colonade before the door."], [241, "CHAP. XXII. Of the Cities, Towns, Seats, and Curiosities of those Parts of Somerset, that are in the Neighbourhood of Bristol. BATH, 13 miles south-east from Bristol Exchange, was, in the time of the Romans, famous for its Hot Waters, which were the Therm\u00e6 of Ptolemy ; the Aquae Solis of Antoninus ; and the Fontes callidi of Solinus. Numerous are the Roman Antiquities that have been found here ; for accounts of which, see Collinsons Beauties oj' British Antiquity, and the Bath Guides. This City is supplied with excellent Water, both hard and soft, by copious springs which rise in the adjacent hills. The Hot Waters rise in the centre of the city. It is generally agreed that the hot waters contain a small quantity of carbonic acid and axotic gas, some sulphate and muriate of soda, selinite, carbonate of lime, muriate of magnesia, selicious earth, and a very small portion of oxy-carbonate, of iron. Raises Fahrenheit's thermometer to 119 degrees. This, which was one of the smallest, is now one of the largest cities of England. Its unrivalled, hot and excellent mineral water, wholesome air, elegant build ings, good accommodations and variety of amuse ments, continually attract visitants and establish resi dents ; so that it has been for many years, and is at present, increasing in beautiful houses, wealthy and polite inhabitants, is become, indisputably, the best built city in the kingdom, and the provincial metro polis of fashion, taste, and elegance. The ancient part of the city is situated in a vale ; and the modern part principally on a hill to the north, gradually"], [242, "220 rising to a great height. Each part has a set of As sembly rooms; and each has a master of the cere monies. The squares, obelisks, circus, crescents, and many regular and magnificent piles, may remind the literary traveller of old Rome, of which Bath is the nearest resemblance that this country can afford. The buildings and places that particularly deserve the attention of a stranger, are, the lofty Cathedral, St. Michael's and Walcot Churches, and St. Mary's Chapel, the Upper Rooms, the Baths, the superb Pump-room, the Town-hall, the Hospital, the north Parade, and south Parade ; Queen's and St. James's Squares, the Circus and Royal Crescent, both une qualled in England ; Landsdown place and Chapel ; several beautiful streets, Milsome, Gay, Bond, Brock, and Bath-streets and Colonades, New King-street, &c. &c. ; the two Bridges ; and over the new Bridge, Laura-place; Great Pulteney-street, 100 feet wide; Sidney Gardens, admirably laid out ; the new town in Bathwick, &c. This city is nowr of considerable extent; a mile and a half long from S.W. to N.E. and excepting Bristol, the largest and most populous place in the West of England, and stands in the first rank of English cities, for magnitude, beauty and popularity. The Police and Paving of Bath are super-excellent. It has eight churches and eight chapels for the established religion ; and thirteen Chapels and Meeting-houses for other denominations. Here are several hospitals ; a Free Grammar-school ; other Schools and Public Buildings, which, with the whole city, are built of freestone. The city is go verned by a mayor, recorder, ten aldermen, and 20 common councilmen. The number of Inhabitants of Bath, 46,688, having increased in the last 10 years 8254, \u2014 census 1821. Four Weekly Newspapers are published here. The whole town, its antiquities, buildings, waters, and abundance of noble and polite company are pleasing objects of attention and specu lation. The lower and more ancient part of the town is now much improving by act of parliament. For further particulars see the Bath Guides."], [243, "221 WELLS, about 20 miles from Bristol; a neat, plea sant, rural, and healthy city, which has one of the finest cathedrals in England (St. Andrew's,) built by Robert de Lewes, and Jofeline de Welles : and hal lowed or dedicated 23d October, 1239. Its outside has a most venerable appearance, and the western front is very magnificent, being an entire pile of sta tues, much admired for ancient Gothic imagery. It has one tower over the cross, and two at the western end ; in one of which is a fine peal of eight bells, the tenor of which weighs three tons. This church is in length 380 feet; broad at the cross 127; breadth of nave and aisles 67 ; height of nave 67 ; height of the great tower 179; of the western towers 126 each. The parish church of St. Cuthbert, is a handsome, spacious, Gothic structure. The Bishop's Palace, walled in, and moated round ; some ancient arches and gateways ; and a new Shire-hall built of stone, are worthy of attention. The streets are well paved, with flagged footways. Near to this city are Wookey hole and Cheddar-cliffs. GLASTONBURY ABBEY, 6 miles from Wells, formerly the richest and most magnificent in the world. It was liberally endowed by King Ina who built the great church which was laid in ruins at the Reformation. The Abbot's kitchen is now more entire than any other part, On a lofty conical hill near to the town, was a church, dedicated to St. Michael ; on the tower of which, Richard Whiting, the last Abbot, was hanged by Henry VIII. for con tumacious expressions, and reluctance to deliver up his rich benefice to the king's commissioners. The church is in ruins, but the tower, still standing, is called Glastonbury Torr, and is one of the principal land-marks of the west. DUNDRY, about four miles and a half S. W. from Bristol, is the loftiest hill about it, and in this coun try, and an object in many distant parts and counties in England and Wales, having a church, with a tower near 100 feet in height, and very much resembles that of St. Stephen's in Bristol ; it has battlements"], [244, "222 and pinnacles of hollow work, and a good stair-case up to the leads on the top. It. was built in 1482 ; and was repaired in 1793, by Benjamin Griffin, then churchwarden. The church is small and low, has two aisles, and several monuments; the whole breadth about 25 feet, length about 45 and the centre suppor ted by stone pillers. Dundry Tower is a conspicuous land-mark of the western suburbs of Bristol, being situated near the end of a ridge of hills, about four miles in length, and so remarkable for their height, and for the noble and extensive prospects that may be taken from them ; but are rarely visited by the in habitants of Bristol, though they have the hill and tower so frequently in view. There cannot be a more delightful summer excursion than to tbe top of this hill, either through the road or fields. From thence you command delightful views of the Bristol Channel, downward ; coast, country, and mountains of Wales to a great extent ; of the Severn upward ; Malvern hills in Worcestershire ; City arid Cathedral of Glocester; (from the top of Dundry Tower with a telescope) Stinchcomb Hill, near to Dursley ; the cities of Bristol and Bath ; to the east, the White Horse in Wiltshire, 35 miles off; Marlborough Mount ; and from Mais knowle Tump, near to the eastern end of the hill, may be clearly seen, in a fair day, the tower at Stour ton, built by the late Sir Richard Hoare. Near the tower in the church-yard is the remains of a cross, being one solid stone about 12 feet high, elevated on circular steps, which has an antique and venerable appearance. About a quarter of a mile from the church are the quarries from whence was brought the stone with which Redcliff church was built. PILL, on the south side of the Avon, about five miles from Bristol ; inhabited by pilots. Here is a house dependent on the Custom-house, from which all outward bound vessels are finally cleared. ABBOT'S LEIGH, three miles west of Bristol, once noted for the great Manor-house, which afford ed an asylum to Charles IJf. when it belonged to a Mr. Norton.

The church and village are situated on an eminence, and com mand delightful prospects of the Severn, Wales, Avon, and Glocestershire. LONG ASHTON, 3 miles S.W. from Bristol, is a pleasant vale, between Dundry and Leigh-down^ The land is rich and well-cultivated ; abounds with neat cottages and gardens, in which are raised flow ers, vegetables, fruit, and particularly great quanti ties of strawberries and raspberries, which are here eaten with cream, by the visitants from the Hotwells and Bristol. Here are some good houses and gen teel families ; and the seat and park of Sir John Smyth, bart. built by Inigo Jones. The front is large, and has a great number of windows. ARNO's VALE, in the road to Bath, about a mile and a half from Bristol Exchange. On the right hand is a elegant seat, and on the left is a building resembling a castle, ornamented with towers, pin nacles, aud battlements. Here is erected the Castle gate of Bristol ; on the outside are placed in niches two statues of Saxon Princes, taken from Lawford's gate; and on the inside, the statues of Robert, Earl of Glocester, and Godfrey, Bishop of Constance, taken from Newgate. BRISLINGTON, two miles from Bristol, in the road lo Bath, a pleasant village, on the side of a hill ; has a good church and tower, several handsome houses and wealthy inhabitants. In the church-yard is a large tomb-stone, with the following inscription : \" 1542. Thomas Newman, aged 153. This stone was new- faced in the year 1771, to perpetuate the great age of the deceased.\" BROCKLEY COMB, 9 miles W.S.W. from Bris tol, through Long Ashton, is much admired for it*"], [246, "224 romantic beauty. On each side of the road, the hills are adorned with lofty trees that stand over each other most remarkably ; and the sublimity of the scene is heigthened by the traveller's discerning through the apertures, rocks and precipices of a very venerable appearance. CLEVEDON, 13 miles west of Bristol, bordering on the Severn Sea. The way to it is to ascend the road to Leigh Down, and take the road to tbe left, which leads to Fayland's Inn ; three miles beyond which is Nash House. A mile and a half beyond is Cuthberry Camp, a Roman station, the entrench ments of which are yet almost entire, and command extensive views of the Channel, Coast, and Country. From hence, over a lofty ridge of hills, are two miles to the Pleasure-house on Clevedon-hill, from which are grand prospects, viz. of Nailsea Moor, abound ing in cattle ; of Mendip Hills, Cheddar, Brent Knowle, and Quantock ; to the north, of the Bristol Channel, Mountains of Wales, and Aust Passage; to the south-west, of the Steep and Flat Holmes, and the Light-house on the latter. A mile to the north west is the ruins of Walton Castle. HENGROVE, a handsome seat pleasantly situ ated at about three miles south-east of Bristol Ex change. In the second field westward of this house stands a stout square stone above three feet high, which had a flat stone fastened to its front, with the following inscription engraved in capitals : \u2014 To praise the Lord our God devise, All honour to him shew, And at his footstool worship him, That holy is and true. Moses, Aaron, and Samuel, As Priests, on him did call. When they did pray he heard them well, And gave them answer all. The princely power of our King Doth love Judgement and Right, Thou rightly rules! every thing, In Jacob, thiough thy might."], [247, "225 Know thou, that he who is above, For evermore shall reign, And in the seat of Equity; True Judgment will maintain. With Justice will he keep and guide The World and every wight, And so will yield with Equity, To every man his right. Erected A.D. 1536, Repaired 1748. The first date is about the era of the Reformation, began by Thomas Lord Cromwell ; as a memorial of which this probably was erected. Since the year 1795, when the above was copied, part of the flat stone containing the inscription has been stolen away ; the rest lay on the ground, which is now en tirely destroyed. The stone that remains is one of the boundaries of the parish of Bedminster, and when the Minister and Churchwardens go in procession to examine the bounds, they here stop, read a prayer, and sing the 118th Psalm, which appears to be an ancient custom. We would recommend the re-erec tion of this stone, with the before-mentioned inscrip tion, as a piece of antiquity which ought to be pre served, and might be done at a trifling expence by the parish of Bedminster. KEYNSHAM, a market town, in the road to Bath, five miles from Bristol, has a spacious old Gothic Church, with a good tower and eight bells. This was heretofore noted for its Abbey, and for having been the principal seat of the Cangi. It is about a mile in length, chiefly consisting of one street of low houses, built of stone. There is a bridge here over the river Chew, the stream of which works Copper mills below, and then falls into the Avon, on which also is a bridge of nine arches. These parts are fa mous for the cultivation of Woad, used in dying1 blue ; also for Snake and Serpentine stones, many of which may be seen in the town. K1NGSDOWN, about seven miles south-west of Bristol. Here is dug the red colouring for marking sheep ; which is also prepared for painting, and Ge"], [248, "226 called Spanish Brown; and sometimes used for mak ing an imitation of Armenian Bole, being a similar astringent. STANTON-DREW, 6 miles from Bristol. Here is an antiquity, supposed to be the remains of a Dru idical Temple, much in the same form as that at Stonehenge, forming nearly three circles of large stones, various sizes, to the heigth of 14 feet, and 24 feet in circumference. They are situated in a field. Among some Poems, which Mr. Curnick, a native of Bristol has published, we find the following ODE, Written at * Stanton Drew, Somersetshire. As twilight spreads her dim veil o'er the mead. Here, (once grim superstition's favorite scene,) I rove ; and has bright Ph\u0153bus' rays recede, Invoke the hoary shade, that dwells unseen !\u2014 That oft, when midnight o'er creation^lours, A sofily-soothing cadence pours, Beneath some spreading oak reclin'd, \"J Round which the wreathing ivy's twin'd ; > Or, in the solemn grove for secret rites enjoin'd. ) Ye mouldering stones, of wond'rous height That time's all-ruthless hand display ; Your mystic pow'rs are wrapp'd in night; Ye here no more the Bardic lay ! In vain fair wisdom's radiant eye, Would pierce your dark surrounding gloom, So we with doubtful minds descry The soul's resort beyond the tomb. Then, from this scene, ye thoughtless, learn, Who on the giddy phantom wait: To these once honour'd relics turn And view of earthly things the fate! Turn then, nor walk in Folly's footsteps wild ; For pleasure is a transitory ray, Which life's fair-rising morn doth faintly gild ; But hid, forlorn ye tread the devious way. * Thi words Stanton Drew are SaxoD, ud mean th* stone town of the Drnidf."], [249, "227 STOWEY, about nine miles south from Bristol, is noted for a petrifying Spring. WRINGTON, ten miles and a half south-west from Bristol, a market town. Near to it is dug and prepared Lapis Calaminaris, which, mixed with cop per, makes brass ; it also produces Zinc, (sometimes called Spelter) of which and copper are made pinch beck, and princes metal. Mr. John Locke, that excellent metaphisician, was born in this town ; in 1632, and died 1704. His Treaties concerning Hu man Understanding, Government, Education Toler ation, Study, &c. prove him to have been one of the Lights of the World, and an honor to humanity. To the account of Places in Somersetshire STOURTON, in Wiltshire, is added, because the High Cross of Bristol is erected there ; and also the lofty Tower, named Alfred's, is visible to the naked eye, so near to Bristol as the eastern end of Dundry Hill, just above Whitchurch. This tower is 155 feet high, has steps to the top, on which a gallery is railed in securely. As the hill on which it stands is very eminent and conspicuous, nothing can be conceived more striking than the vast prospects from every side of the summit of this structure. There is a path, through fields, by Hengrove, to Mais-Knowle Tump, where, in a clear day, this monument may be viewed. It appears at the extremity of the horizon, a little to the east of the Glass-house at Wick, and is about 35 miles from Bristol."], [250, "CHAP. XXIII. Towns, Seats, and Curiosities in Glocestershire, fye. and Vicinity of Bristol. ALMONDSBURY, about 7 miles N. from Bristol, in the road to Glocester, from whence there is a prospect of the Severn Sea and the adjacent counties. Under the hill stands the Church, which has a spire covered with lead. Here also is an endowed Cha rity-school. It is said that Alemond, the father of Egbert, was buried in this church ; if so, the etymo logy of the same is evident. At Knole, in this pa rish, is also an ancient fortification, with a double ditch ; and an old seat of the family of Chester. There is a tradition that the camp was the work of Offa; in 1650, at Over, a coffin was dug of a tumu lous, the bones of which exceeded the common sta ture, and this was supposed, by many persons, to be the burial place of the latter. ALVESTON, ten miles from Bristol : near the church, are the remains of an ancient building, which appears once to have occupied no less than 25 acres of land. It should seem, from the very formidable walls and battlements which are still standing, that it must have been a strong fortress ; but as history as well as tradition are silent respecting it, it is im possible to speak of it with any degree of certainty. she embattled wall is 70 yards long, 24 feet high, and 7 feet thick ; and near the grand entrance to the building appears the remains of a chapel. The whole will undoubtedly be viewed by the Antiqua rian with pleasure ; and a close consideration of it may lead to some account of its erection, which might prove agreeable and profitable."], [251, "229 ABSTON and WICK, about seven miles E. from Bristol, through Kingswood and Warmley. Here are on the sides of the little river Boyd, rocks some what similar to St. Vincent's, but less. Sparry sub stances are found here, but not so hard or so clear as the Bristol stones. AUST or OLD PASSAGE, 11 miles from Bristol, Here is a Ferry to cross the Severn, two miles over. The house has good accommodation for company, and commands extensive prospects of land and wa ter. Here King Edward the elder summoned Lio line, Prince of Wales, to cross the Severn, and confer with him, which he refused to do. Therefore, Ed ward passed over to him, who, on seeing the King in the boat, threw his robes on the ground, and leap ing into the water, said, \"Most wise King, your humility has conquered my pride, and your wisdom triumphed over my folly,\" &c. BADxMINGTON. The seat of His Grace the Duke of Beaufort, about 16 miles N.E. from Bristol. A magnificent mansion, or rather palace, with a park inclosed with a wall, 10 miles in circumference, in which are distinct parts for red and fallow deer, and beautiful plantations of trees. The house contains fine paintings, excellent antique sculptures, and a noble library. The Parish Church is near to the house, a handsome structure built at the Duke's ex pense ; and has two superb marble monuments of the Duke's ancestors, both sculptured in Italy. BLAZE CASTLE, about four miles N.N.W. from Bristol, in the parish of Henbury, is a large triangular tower or ca>sellated building, containing a very large circular room and several smaller ones. It stands on a fine eminence, commanding extensive and de lightful prospects of the Severn, Bristol Channel, Wales, and circumjacent country. This structure was built, and the woods planted and walks laid out with great laste, by Thomas Farr, esq. who was mayor of Bristol in 1775, and afterwards resided in London. In digging the foundation, several brass and silver coins of Roman Emperors were found, as"], [252, "230 noticed before. The edifice has its name from a Chapel which formerly stood here, dedicated to St. Blazias, Bishop of St. Sebastian, and Patron of the Woollen Manufacturers. Here is also a capital man sion which is the residence of its present possessor, John Scandrett Harford. esq. D.C.L. CHEPSTOW, in Monmouthshire, 18 miles north from Bristol, remarkable for its tides, which some times rise here 60 feet ; it has a lofty bridge, good foreign and domestic trade, and venerable remains of a flue old castle. . CHIPPING-SODBURY, about 11 miles north east from Bristol, in the road to Oxford, is a market town, with a wide street, half a mile in length. It is governed by a mayor and aldermen. The church is a chapel of ease to Old Sodbury, 2 miles off. GOTHAM, a hill about a furlong north-west from Bristol. Here is a handsome seat, the residence of John Barrow, Esq. late Mayor of Bristol. Near the hov^ is a round Tower or observatory, 70 feet high, on which the spectator has fine prospects of Bristol, and surrounding country. A curious sort of rusticated stoue, suitable for the embellishment of pillars and gateways, has been obtained here. CREW's HOLE, about 2 miles east from Bristol, on the banks of the Avon. Here are large works for smelting copper. DIRHAM, about 10 miles east from Bristol, re markable for a victory gained by Ceaulin, King of the West-Saxons, over the Britons; and fora fine house (near to the church) 150 feet in front, and cu rious water-works. DODINGTON, 12 miles north-east from Bristol. Here is a large handsome seat, though not modern} in the front of it are two beautiful pieces of water, one above the other, which are supplied by the spring that is one of the heads of the river Froom, which runs through Bristol. FRENCHAY, four miles north-east from Bristol, has many handsome houses and opulent inhabitants ; a coffee-house, and two meeting-houses. At the"], [253, "231 eastern end of the common is a remarkable lusus naturae, taken out of a quarry at Downend ; an entire perfcet muscle, of nearly two tons weight. HENBURY, a very pleasant, rural and healthy village, situate about 5 miles north-west from Bristol Exchange, in which are many good houses and wealthy inhabitants. It has a spacious parish church, which for beauty and internal workmanship is not to be excelled by any country church in these parts. In the church are many handsame monuments, and some of Lord De Clifford's family. In the tower are six bells and a good clock. The church-yard, which for neatness we rarely see its equal, and for monu mental tombs and epitaphs few country church-yards presents so pleasing a variety. Adjoining stands a free school well endowed. At a small distance from the church are situated ten Cottages, built by the late Mr. Harford, for the gratuitous residence of aged persons of very small incomes. These cottages we pronounce worthy the notice of the curious, having such a variety of display in architecture not to be equalled in England. They are all built seperate and each has a garden adjoining. The neat appear ance, rural and retired situation of these cottages cannot fail to gratify the visitant, who will admire the taste of their benevolent founder, who has thus employed his ground and property to such good pur poses. Strangers are admitted on Thursdays, on sending their Names any previous day to the Gar dener, Mr. Thompson. \u2014 Entrance to the grounds on Henbury hill. K1NGWESTON, about 4 miles north-west from Bristol. Here is a good Inn situated on the brow of the hill, much frequented by visitants from this city ; the seat of Lord De Clifford, a noble mansion of stone, built by Sir John Vanburgh. In it is a capital collection of paintings, extensive gardens and planta tions, and an incomparable hot-house. From this house, Kingweston Inn, and Penpole hill are some of the most beautiful prospects imaginable, of the mouth of the Avon, the Denny Island ; Glamorgan,"], [254, "232 Monmouth, and Glocestersbire, mouth of the rives Wye, and the Old and New Passages. NEW PASSAGE, 9 miles and a half from Bristol. The Severn is here 3 miles broad at high water, and the Passage-house very pleasant and commodious. OLDBURY, 3milesand a half north-east from Bris tol, through Staple-ton or Fishponds, stands the seat of Mrs. Graham, widow of the late Esq. Graham. In this place are elegant rural walks through woods and over precipices, that have the river Froom be neath, reflecting tbe trees and rocks on its banks, and running over a weir that forms an agreeable cascade. PEN-PARK HOLE, 6 miles north-west from Bristol, a tremendous abyss, by some reported to be unfathomable, and by others, to be about 300 feet deep : noticed by various authors, and in the Philoso phical Transactions. It is situated in the corner of a field, and inclosed with a wall to prevent accidents fatal to men and beasts. The ground about the en trance is below the level of the field. The principal hole is dangerous to approach, and terrible to behold ; a little below the entrance appears an impending rock and all the rest is frightful gloom. People throw stones into it, which are heard, for some time, dashing against rocks, and at last plunging into water. On the 17th of March 1775, the Rev. M. Newnham, one of the canons of the cathedral of Bristol, with another gentleman and two ladies, one of them his sister, and the other the object of his affection, went to explore the depth of this horrible cavity. Mr. N. lowered a line, and being near the dark aperture, that he might be safer, laid hold of a twig pertaining to the root of an ashen tree, which grew over the mouth of it. But, his foot slipping, the twig broke, and he was precipitated into this yawning, black, and dreadful gulpb, in the sight of his astonished and almost pe trified friends. That morning he had officiated at Clifton church, and read psalm the 88th, in which are these words so descriptive of his catastrophe : \u2022* Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in a place of darkness, and in the deep.\" After this shocking ac-"], [255, "233 cident so many people went from Bristol to see this hole that the place about it was like a fair. Vehicles for descending were contrived, and some went down daily to search for the body, which was found 39 days after, floating on the water. PIERCEFIE1D, in Monmouthshire, one mile and a half from Chepstow. This place has many visitants and is much celebrated for its rocks, woods, pros pects of the Wye, the Severn, and Bristol channel, the bridge, town, and castle of Chepstow. Strangers are admitted only on Tuesdays and Fridays. About five miles from hence is Tintern Abbey, one of the most venerable ruins of a Gothic church in the kingdom. REDLAND, one mile N.N.W. from Bristol, a handsome village, in which are several good houses ; the principal mansion here is Redland Court, built by John Cousens, Esq. from a design of Strachan, architect ; and enlarged and improved by Jeremiah Baker, Esq. It is now an elegant modern structure, and very ornamental to that part of the environs. The present possessor is Sir Richard Vaughan, knt. Near to it is a beautiful chapel, built of freestone, with a turret containing a bell, crowned with a dome of lead, ball, and cross, a miniature resemblance of St. Paul's, in London. In this chapel are the busts of Mr. and Mrs. Coussens, well executed, in marble, by Rysbrack ; and a capital painting on the altar- piece of the embalming of Jesus, by Vanderbank, and many other highly-finished embellishments. Mr. Thorne having celebrated the beauties of this seat, we shall beg leave once more to trespass on his Poem, by inserting the following lines : Delightful spot, mid Summer'* piercing beat, How oft I've wandered to thy blest retreat !

STOKE -BISHOP, two miles north-west from Bristol, where is a fine old mansion, the seat of Sir Henry Lipincot, Bart. Some years ago, as some labourers were digging in what had been an old Ro man way, they found the jaw-bones and teeth of an elephant. About a mile to the south are a lofty house and tower of stone, of a very good design, standing on the brow of a high clift that rises from the bank of the river Avon. This building, which greatly embellishes these parts and prospects, is call ed Cook's Folly, from a story current thereabout, that one Cook dreamed that he should die by the bite of a Viper, and therefore built and confined him self in this place. But all his caution could not avert his destiny, for as he was sitting by the fire, a viper sprung from some faggots, and bit him so effectually as to occasion what he had been at so much expence to avoid. Over the entrance to this house are the following letters in stone, I COOKE, 1693. STOKE-HOUSE, Stapleton, 2 miles north-east from Bristol, the seat of the Duchess Dowager of Beaufort. The late Lord Bottetourt rebuilt it about the year 1760, and it is a very noble mansion, on a fine verdant hill. The surrounding spacious woods, tem ples, and monuments, well merit the visits of the curious; and in Summer may be justly stiled a ter restrial paradise. Q T\\V R3 THORNBURY, 1 1 miles north-east of Bristol, a market town, consisting of four or five streets, one of which is about half a mile in length; has four good inns, and many respectable inhabitants ; here ajre four neat chapels for different dissenters. The town"], [257, "235 is governed by a mayor and twelve aldermen. Its si tuation is on an elevation, and very desirable. It is remarkable for a spacious church, resembling a ca thedral, with a lofty and beautiful tower, not unlike that of Dundry ; and for the remains of a castle, with an authentic account of which the printer hereof has been favoured by the housekeeper at the castle, trans cribed from an ancient book in Old English Print. \" This Castle stands in the hundred a\u00abd manor of Thornburv, from which it takes, its name. Leland treating of it ia bis Itinerary, says \u2014 Edward, late Duke of Bukkynbam, likynge the soyle about, and the site of the house, pullyd downe a grete part of the olde house, aud sel up magnificently, iu good squarred stone the soutbe side of it ; and accomplished the west part also with a comely gate house to the fijsl soOe, and so it stondith yet, with a rose forced for a tyme.' This inscription on the front of the gate bouse \u2014 \" This gate was begun in tbe yere of our Lord God 1511 tbe 2d year of the reign of Kynge Henry tbe VIII. by me Edward, Duke of Bukkynbam, Earle of Here ford, Stafford, and Northampton.\" Upon a scroll on the rij\u00a3ht-hand of the gateway are the following letters ; DORENESAVANI. He likewise made a fine Park near the Castle, for which purpose be enclosed a considerable tract of rich corn ground. Atkins says, he had a licence from Henry VII. to empark 1000 acres. This accord ing to Leland, drew on him the curses of tbe neighbourhood. He also proposed to have brought up to ihe Castle, a small branch of the Severn, which flowed into the Park. He did not however live either to perform this, or to finish his bnildiug. being beheaded anno. 1522 ; and bis estates then escheating to the Crowu, it was mever compleated. Historians seem in some measure to attribute his fall to the effects of a rediculous quar rel he had with Cardinal Wolsey on tbe following occasion ; tbe Dike one day after dinner according to an accustomed ceremonial, being on his knees holding a basin of water to the King, who bad just finished washing, and turned away; the Cardinal, before the Duke could alter his posture, sportingly dipped in his hand; which so. offended the haughty Buckingham, that rising in a rage, he threw tbe water in Wolsey's shoes. He in his tura being greatly incensed, threatened him that he would sit on bis skirts. On the morrow the Duke came to Court withont skirts to his doublet; the King demanding the reason thereof, Buckingham related tho Cardinal's menace, and said he had taken this method to prevent bis putting it in execution. The Female inhabitant, for a small gratuity, will .show several Rooms yet entire, which, with the ruins of the Castle and its out-woaks, are worthy of notice. WESTBURY upon Trim, four miles north-west of Bristol Exchange; has a handsome old Parish Church, built of stone, with three spacious aisles, and in the tower six bells. There is at the entrance of this parish an elegant mansion, called Cote House, Here was formerly a College for a Dean and five Canons, built by William Cannynges, who was its first Dean. Some of the parts of it that remain, and buildings erected since, constitute a gentleman's seat. There is also a chapel for Methodists.
