A C T I. SCENE I \u2014 A Street in Venice. Enter Antonio, Salarino, and Solanio, l. Ant. In sooth, I know not why I am so sad ; It wearies me ; you say, it wearies you ; But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born, I am to learn ; And such a want-wit sadness makes of me, That I have much ado to know myself. Sol. Your mind is tossing on the ocean ; There, where your argosies with portly sail, Like signiors and rich burghers of the flood, Do over-peer the petty traffickers, That curtsey to them, do them reverence, As they fly by them with their woven wings. Sala. Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind ; Peering in maps, for ports, and piers, and roads ; B"], [20, "2 THE MERCHANT OF VENICE. And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt, Would make me sad. Sol. My wind, cooling my broth, Would blow me to an ague, when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea. I should not see the sandy hour-glass run, But I should think of shallows, and of flats ; And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand, Vailing her high top lower than her ribs, To kiss her burial. Shall I have the thought To think on this : and shall I lack the thought, That such a thing, bechanc'd, would make me sad ? But, tell not me ; I know, Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandize. Ant. Believe me, no : I thank my fortune for it, My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, Nor to one place ; nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year : Therefore my merchandize makes me not sad. Sola. Why then you are in love. Ant. Fie, fie ! Sala. Not in love neither ? Then let's say, you are sad, Because you are not merry : and 'twere as easy For you to laugh, and leap, and say, you are merry, Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus, Nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time : Some that will evermore peep through their eyes, And laugh like parrots, at a bag-piper ; And other of such vinegar aspect, That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile, Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable. Sol. Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman, Gratiano, and Lorenzo : fare you well ; We leave you now with better company. Sala. I would have stay'd till I had made you merry, If worthier friends had not prevented me. (Crosses to Solanio.)"], [21, "THE MERCHANT OF VENICE. 3 Ant. Your worth is very dear in my regard. I take it, your own business calls on you, And you embrace the occasion to depart. Enter Bassanio, Gratiano, and Lorenzo, l. Sala. Good morrow, my good lords. Sas. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh ? say, when ? (Crosses to Salartno.) You grow exceeding strange ; must it be so ? Sol. We'll make our leisures to attend on yours. [Exeunt Solanio and Salaeino, E. Lor. My lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We two will leave you ; but, at dinner-time, I pray you, have in mind where we must meet. Sas. I will not fail you. 6-ra. You look not well, Signior Antonio ; You have too much respect upon the world : They lose it, that do buy it with much care. Believe me, you are marvellously chang'd. Ant. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano ; A stage where every man must play a part, And mine a sad one. Crra. Let me play the fool : With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come ; And let my liver rather heat with wine, Than my heart cool with mortifying groans. Why should a man, whose blood is warm within, Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? Sleep when he wakes ? and creep into the jaundice By being peevish ? I tell thee what, Antonio, \u2014 I love thee, and it is my love that speaks ; There are a sort of men, whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond ; And do a wilful stillness entertain, With purpose to be drest in an opinion Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit ; As who should say, I am Sir Oracle, And, when I ope my lips, let no dog bark !"], [22, "4 THE MERCHANT OF VENICE. O, my Antonio, I do know of these, That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing : who, I am very sure, Ji they should speak, would almost dam those ears, Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools. I'll tell thee more of this another time : But fish not with this melancholy bait, For this fool's gudgeon, this opinion. \u2014 Come, good Lorenzo : \u2014 fare ye well, awhile \u2014 (crosses to L.) I'll end my exhortation after dinner. Lor. Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time : I must be one of these same dumb wise men ; For Gratiano never lets me speak. Ora. Well, keep me company but two years more, Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue. Ant. Farewell! I'll grow a talker for this gear. Ora. Thanks, i'faith ; for silence is only commendable In a neat's tongue dried, and a maid not vendible. [Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo, l. Ant. Is that any thing now ? Sas. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice : his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff; you shall seek all day ere you find them ; and when you have them, they are not worth the search. Ant. Well : tell me now, what lady is this same, To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, That you to-day promis'd to tell me of? Sas. 'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, How much I have disabled mine estate, By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance : Nor do I now make moan to he abridg'd From such a noble rate ; but my chief care Is, to come fairly off from the great debts, Wherein my time, something too prodigal, Hath left me gag'd. To you, Antonio, I owe the most, in money, and in love ; \" And from your love I have a warranty"], [23, "THE MEBCHANT OF VENICE. 5 To unburthen all my plots and purposes, How to get clear of all the debts I owe.

Sas. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft, I shot his fellow of the self-same flight The self-same way, with more advised watch, To find the other forth; and by advent'ring both, I oft found both : I urge this childhood proof, Because what follows is pure innocence. I owe you much ; and, like a wilful youth, That which I owe is lost : but if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt, As I will watch the aim, or to find both, Or bring your latter hazard back again, And thankfully rest debtor for the first. Ant. You know me well; and herein spend but time, To wind about my love with circumstance ; And, out of doubt, you do me now more wrong, In making question of my uttermost, Than if you had made waste of all I have : Then do but say to me, what I should do, That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am prest unto it : therefore, speak. Sas. In Belmont is a lady richly left, And she is fair, and, fairer than that word, Of wondrous virtues ; sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages ; Her name is Portia ; nothing undervalued To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia. Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth ; For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors.

Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea ; Nor have I money, nor commodity To raise a present sum : therefore go forth, Try what my credit can in Venice do ; That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost, To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia. Go, presently inquire, and so will I, Where money is ; and I no question make, To have it of my trust, or for my sake. [Exeunt, R. SCENE II.\u2014 Poetia's Souse at Selmont.

You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick, that surfeit with too much , as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean ; superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer. Por. Good sentences, and well pronounc'd. Ner. They would better, if well follow'd. Por. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages, princes' palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions : I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband : \u2014 O me, the word choose ! I may neither choose whom I would, nor refuse whom I dislike ; so is the will of a living daughter curb'd by the will of a dead father: \u2014 Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none ?"], [25, "THE MERCHANT OF VENICE. 7 Ner. Your father was ever virtuous ; and holy men, at their death, have good inspirations ; therefore, the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead, (whereof, who chooses his meaning, chooses you,) will, no doubt, never be chosen by any rightly, but one whom you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come ? Por. I pray thee, over-name them ; and as thou nam'st them, I will describe them ; and, according to my descrip tion, level at my affection. Ner. First, there is the Neapolitan prince. Por. Ay, that's a colt, indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse ; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts, that he can shoe him himself. Ner. Then, there is the County Palatine. Por. He doth nothing but frown; as who should say, \"An if you will not have me, choose :\" he hears merry tales, and smiles not : I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death's head with a bone in his mouth, than to either of these. Heaven defend me from these two ! Ner. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon? Por. Heaven made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. Ner. How Like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew ? Por. Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober ; and most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk : when he is best, he is little worse than a man ; and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast ; an the worst fall that ever fell, I hope, I shall make shift to go without him. (Crosses to E.) Ner. IS he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father's will, if you should refuse to accept him. Por. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket ; for, if"], [26, "8 THE MERCHANT OF VENICE. the devil be within, and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. Ner. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords ; they have acquainted me with their determinations : which is, indeed, to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit : unless you may be won by some other sort than your father's imposition, depending on the caskets. For. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable ; for there is not one among them but I doat on his very absence, and I pray Heaven grant them a fair departure. Ner. Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a Venetian, a scholar, and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat ? Por. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so he was call'd. Ner. True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look'd upon, was the best deserving a fair lady. Por. I remember him well ; and I remember him worthy of thy praise. Enter Balthazar, l. Por. How now ! what news ? (Crosses to L.) Sal. The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave ; and there is a fore-runner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco : who brings word, the prince, his master, will be here to-night. Por. If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. Come, Nerissa. \u2014 Sirrah, go before. \u2014 Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door. [Exeunt, L."], [27, "THE MERCHANT OF VENICE. 9 SCENE III.\u2014 A Street in Venice.

Shy. Antonio shall become bound, \u2014 well. Sas. May you stead me ? Will you pleasure me ? Shall I know your answer ? Shy. Three thousand ducats, for three months, and Antonio bound. Sas. Your answer to that. Shy. Antonio is a good man. Sas. Have you heard any imputation to the contrary ? Shy. Ho, no, no, no, no ; my meaning, in saying he is a good man, is to have you understand me, that he is sufficient : yet his means are in supposition : he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies ; I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, \u2014 and other ventures he hath, squander'd abroad : but ships are but boards, sailors but men : there be land rats, and water rats, water thieves, and land thieves ; I mean pirates ; and then, there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks ; the man is, notwithstanding, sufficient : \u2014 three thou- sand ducats ; \u2014 I think I may take his bond. Sas. Be assur'd you may. Shy. I will be assur'd, I may ; and, that I may be assured, I will bethink me : may I speak with Antonio ? Sas. If it please you to dine with us. Shy. Yes, to smell pork : to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite, conjured the devil into : I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following ; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. \u2014 What news on the Rialto ? \u2014 (crosses to E.)

When Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban's sheep, \u2014 This Jacob from our holy Abraham was (As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,) The third possessor ; ay, he was the third. Ant.

When Laban and himself were compromis'd, That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied Should fall as Jacob's hire, The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands, And stuck them up before the fulsome ewes, Who did in eaning time Fall party-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's. This was a way to thrive, and he was blest ; And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not. (Crosses to l.) Ant. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for ; A thing not in his power to bring to pass, But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of Heaven : Was this inserted to make interest good ?

Sir, you are very welcome to our house : It must appear in other ways than words, Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy. Gra. (advancing with Nerissa.) By yonder moon I swear, you do me wrong; In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk : Would he were hang'd that had it, for my part, Since you do take it, love, so much at heart ! Por. A quarrel, ho, already ? what's the matter ? Ora. About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring That she did give to me ; whose posy was, For all the world, like cutler's poetry Upon a knife, Love me, and leave me not. Ner. What talk you of the posy, or the value ? You swore to me, when I did give it you, That you would wear it till your hour of death ; And that it should he with you in your grave : Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths, You should have been respective, and have kept it. Gave it a judge's clerk ! \u2014 but well I know, The clerk will ne'er wear hair on his face that had it. Gra. He will, an if he live to be a man. Ner. Ay, if a woman live to be a man. Gra. Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth, \u2014 A kind of boy ; a little scrubbed boy No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk ; A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee ; I could not for my heart deny it him. Por. You were to blame, I must be plain with you, To part so slightly with your wife's first gift ; A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger, And riveted so with faith unto your flesh. I gave my love a ring, and made him swear Never to part with it ; and here he stands ; I dare be sworn for him, he would not leave it, Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth That the world masters.

Why, I were best to cut my left hand off, And swear I lost the ring defending it. (Aside.) Ora. My lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begg'd it, and, indeed, Deserv'd it too ; and then the boy, his clerk, That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine : And neither man, nor master, would take aught But the two rings. Por. What ring gave you, my lord ? Not that, I hope, which you receiv'd of me. Bas. Ii I could add a lie unto a fault, I would deny it ; but you see, my finger Hath not the ring upon it, \u2014 it is gone. Por. Even so void is your false heart of truth. By Heaven ! I will ne'er eome in your sight Until I see the ring. Ner. Nor I in yours. Bas. Sweet Portia, If you did know to whom I gave the ring, If you did know for whom I gave the ring, And would conceive for what I gave the ring, And how unwillingly I left the ring, When naught would be accepted but the ring, You would abate the strength of your displeasure. Por. H you had known the virtue of the ring, Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, Or your own honour to retain the ring, You would not then have parted with the ring. What man is there so much unreasonable, If you had pleas'd to have defended it With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony ? Nerissa teaches me what to believe ; I'll die for't, but some woman had the ring. Bas. No, by mine honour, madam ! by my soul, No woman had it, but a civil doctor, Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me, And begg'd the ring ; the which I did deny him, And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away ;"], [75, "THE MERCHANT OF VENICE. 57 Even he that held up the very life Of my dear friend.

At present, I am entirely of your opinion \u2014 because I haven't the most distant particle of an idea what you mean. Mrs. B. Why, the gentleman, who has got the attics, is hardly ever without a pipe in his mouth \u2014 and there he sits, with his feet on the mantel-piece \u2014 Cox. The mantel-piece ! That strikes me as being a con siderable stretch, either of your imagination, Mrs. B., or the gentlemen's legs. I presume you mean the fender or the hob. Mrs. B. Sometimes one, sometimes t'other. Well, there he sits for hours, and puffs away into the fire-place. Cox. Ah ! then you mean to say that this gentleman's smoke, instead of emulating the example of all other sorts of smoke, and going up the chimney, thinks proper to effect a singularity by taking the contrary direction ? Mrs. B. Why\u2014 Cox. Then, I suppose, the gentleman you are speaking of is the same individual that I invariably meet coming up stairs when I'm going down, and going down stairs when I'm coming up ? Mrs. S. Why \u2014 yes \u2014 I \u2014 Cox. From the appearance of his outward man, I should unhesitatingly set him down as a gentleman connected with the printing interest. Mrs. B.

A halfpenny worth of milk, Mrs. Bouncer \u2014 and be good enough to let it stand \u2014 I wish the cream to accumulate. [Exit at L. C. Mrs. B. He's gone at last ! I declare I was all in a tremble for fear Mr. Box should come in before Mr. Cox went out. Luckily, they've never met yet \u2014 and, what's more, they're not very likely to do so ; for Mr. Box is hard at work at a newspaper-office all night, and doesn't come home till the morning, and Mr. Cox is busy making hats all day long, and doesn't come home till night ; bo that I'm getting double rent for my room, and neither of my lodgers are any the wiser for it. It was a capital idea of mine \u2014 that it was ! But I haven't an instant to lose. First of all, let me put Mr. Cox's things out of Mr. Box's way. \u2014 (She takes the three hats, Cox's dressing-gown and slippers, opens door at L., and puts them in, then shuts door and locks it.) \u2014 Now then, to put the key where Mr. Cox always finds it. \u2014 (Puts the key on the ledge ofthe door, L.) \u2014 I really must beg Mr. Box not to smoke so much. I was so dreadfully puzzled to know what to say when Mr. Cox spoke about it. Now, then, to make the bed \u2014 and don't let me forget that what's the head of the bed for Mr. Cox becomes the foot of the bed for Mr. Box \u2014 people's tastes do differ so. \u2014 (Goes behind the curtains of the bed, and seems to be making it \u2014 then appears with a very thin bolster in her hand.) \u2014 The idea of Mr. Cox presuming to complain of such a bolster as this! (She disappears again, behind curtains!) Box. (without!) Pooh \u2014 pooh ! Why don't you keep your own side of the staircase, sir? \u2014 (Enters at back, dressed as a printer. Puts his head out at door again, shouting.) \u2014 It was as much your fault as mine, sir ! I say, sir \u2014 it was as much your fault as mine, sir ! Mrs. B.

So it seems ! Far be it from me, Bouncer, to hurry your move ments, but I think it right to acquaint you of my immediate intention of divesting myself of my garments, and going to bed. Mrs. B. Oh, Mr. Box! (Going.) Box. Stop ! Can you inform me who the individual is that I invariably encounter going down stairs when I'm coming up, and coming up stairs when I'm going down ? Mrs. B. (confused.) Oh \u2014 yea \u2014 the gentleman in the attic, sir. Box. Oh ! There's nothing particularly remarkable about him, except his hats. I meet him in all sorts of hats \u2014 white hats and black hats\u2014 hats with broad brims, and hats with narrow brims \u2014 hats with naps, and hats without naps \u2014 in short, I have come to the conclusion that he must be individually and professionally associated with the hatting interest. Mrs. B. Yes, sir. And, by-the-bye, Mr. Box, he begged me to request of you, as a particular favour, that you would not smoke quite so much. Sox. Did he ? Then you may tell the gentle hatter, with my compliments, that if he objects to the effluvia of tobacco, he had better domesticate himself in some adjoining parish. Mrs. B. Oh, Mr. Box ! You surely wouldn't deprive me of a lodger ? (Pathetically.) Box. It would come to precisely the same thing, Bouncer, because, if I detect the slightest attempt to put my pipe out, I at once give you warning that I shall give you warning at once. Mrs. B. Well, Mr. Box, do you want anything more of me ? Box. On the contrary \u2014 I've had quite enough of you. Mrs. B. Well, if ever ! What next, I wonder ? (Goes out at L. c.

In the first place, a candle is an article that I don't require, because I'm only at home in the day-time \u2014 and I bought this candle on the first of May \u2014 chimney- sweepers'-day, \u2014 calculating that it would last me three months, and here's one week not half over, and the candle three parts gone. \u2014 (Lights the fire, then takes down a grid- iron, which is hanging over the fire-place, E.) \u2014 Mrs. Bouncer has been using my gridiron ! The last article of consump- tion that I cooked upon it was a pork chop, and now it is powerfully impregnated with the odour of red herrings ! \u2014 (Places gridiron on fire, and then, with a fork, lays rasher of bacon on the gridiron.) \u2014 How sleepy I am, to be sure ! \u2014 I'd indulge myself with a nap, if there was anybody here to superintend the turning of my bacon. \u2014 (Yawning again.) \u2014 Perhaps it will turn itself.

(The 2nd Aotob and Actbess retire up the stage.) 1 Act. What speech, my lord ? Sam. I heard thee speak me a speech once \u2014 but it was never acted ; or, if it was, not above once : for the play, I remember, pleas'd not the million : 'twas caviare to the general ; but it was an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. One speech in it I chiefly lov'd \u2014 'twas \u00c6neas' tale to Dido \u2014 and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. Ii it live in your memory, begin at this line : \u2014 \" The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast\" \u2014 'Tis not so ; it begins with Pyrrhus. \" The rugged Pyrrhus \u2014 he, whose sable arms, Black as bis purpose, did the night resemble, Old grandsire Priam seeks.\" Pol.

But, as we often see, against some storm, A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, The bold winds speechless, and the orb below As hush as death ; anon, the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region : so, after Pyrrhus' pause, Aroused vengeance sets him new awork, And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall On Mars' armour, forged for proof eterne, With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword Now falls on Priam. \u2014 Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune !\" Pol. This is too long. Sam. It shall to the barber's, with your beard. \u2014 Say on : come to Hecuba. 1 Act. \"But who, ah woe! had seen the mobled queen\" \u2014 Sam. The mobled queen ! Pol. That's good ; the mobled queen is good. 1 Act. \"Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames ; A clout upon that head, Where late the diadem stood ; and, for a robe, A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up : Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep' d, 'Gainst fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd?\" Pol. Look, whether he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's eyes. Pr'ythee, no more. Sam. 'Tis well ; I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon. Good, my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd ?

Follow that lord ; and look you mock him not. [Exeunt Polonius and Actobs, l.

Yet, there is another, and a better world. Fra. To the unfortunate, then, death is scarce an evil ? Tob. Am I so unfortunate ? Do I not enjoy this glorious morning ? Am I not in health again ? Believe me, sir, he who, leaving the bed of sickness, for the first time breathes the fresh pure air, is at that moment the happiest of his Maker's creatures. Fra. Yet 'tis a happiness that fails upon enjoyment. Tob. True ; but less so in old age. Some fifty years ago my father left me this cottage. I was a strong lad, and took an honest wife. Heaven blessed my farm with rich crops, and my marriage with five children. This lasted nine or ten years. Two of my children died. I felt it sorely. The land was afflicted with a famine. My wife assisted me in supporting our family : but, four years after, she left our dwelling for a better place. And of my five children one only son remained. This was blow on blow. It was long before I regained my fortitude. At length, resignation and religion had their effect. I again attached myself to life. My son grew, and helped me in my work. Now, the State has called him away to bear a musket. This is to me a loss indeed. I can work no more. I am old and weak : and true it is, hut for Mrs. Haller, I must have perished. Fra. Still, then, life has its charms for you ? Tob. Why not, while the world holds anything that's dear to me ? Have not I a son ? Fra. Who knows that you will ever see him more ? He may be dead. Tob. Alas ! he may. But, as long as I am not sure of it, he lives to me : and if he falls, 'tis in his country's cause. Nay, Bhould I lose him, still I should not wish to die.

Pet. Extremely sorry. Sol. Where can Mrs. Haller have hid herself ? Bar. Mrs. Haller ! \u2014 who is she ? Sol. Why, who she is, I can't exactly tell your lordship. Pet. No, nor I. Sol. None of my correspondents give any account of her. She is here in the capacity of a kind of superior housekeeper. Methinks I hear her silver voice upon the stairs. I will have the honour of sending her to your lordship in an instant. Bar. Oh! don't trouble yourself. Sol. No trouble, whatever! I remain, at all times, your Honourable Lordship's most obedient, humble, and devoted servant. [Exit, bowing. Pet. Devoted servant. [Exit, bowing. Bar. Now for a fresh plague.

Madam, that title shall be doubly valuable to me, since it gives me an introduction equally to be rejoiced at. Mrs. H. (without attending to the compliment.) This lovely weather, then, has enticed the Count from the city ? Bar. Not exactly that. You know him. Sunshine or"], [240, "20S THE STEANGEE. clouds are to him alike, as long as eternal summer reigns in his own heart and family. Mrs. H. The Count possesses a most cheerful and amiable philosophy. Ever in the same happy humour ; ever enjoying each minute of his life. But you must confess, my lord, that he is a favourite child of Fortune, and has much to be grateful to her for. Not merely because she has given him birth and riches, but for a native sweetness of temper, never to be acquired ; and a graceful suavity of manners, whose school must be the mind. And, need I enumerate among Fortune's favours, the hand and affections of your accomplished sister ? Bar. (more and more struck, as her understanding opens upon him.) True, madam. My good easy brother, too, seems fully sensible of his happiness, and is resolved to retain it. He has quitted the service to live here. I am yet afraid he may soon grow weary of Wintersen and re tirement. Mrs. H. I should trust not. They who bear a cheerful and unreproaching conscience into solitude, surely must in crease the measure of their own enjoyments : they quit the poor, precarious, the dependent pleasures, which they borrowed from the world, to draw a real bliss from that exhaustless source of true delight, the fountain of a pure, unsullied heart. Bar. Has retirement long possessed so lovely an ad vocate ? Mrs. H. I have lived here three years. Bar. And never felt a secret wish for the society you left, and must have adorned ? Mrs. H. Never. Bar. To feel thus belongs either to a very rough or a very polished soul. The first sight convinced me in which class I am to place you. Mrs. H. (with a sigh.) There may, perhaps, be a third case. Bar. Indeed, madam, I wish not to be thought forward ; but women always seemed to me less calculated for retire- ment than men. We have a thousand employments, a thousand amusements, which you have not."], [241, "THE STEANGEE. 209 Mrs. H. Dare I ask what they are ? Bar. We ride \u2014 we hunt \u2014 we play \u2014 read \u2014 write. \u2014 Mrs. H. The noble employments of the chase, and the still more noble employment of play, I grant you. Bar. Nay, but dare I ask what are your employments for a day? Mrs. H. Oh, my lord! you cannot imagine how quickly time passes, when a certain uniformity guides the minutes of our life. How often do I ask, \" Is Saturday come again so soon ?\" On a bright cheerful morning my books and breakfast are carried out upon the grass-plot. Then is the sweeet picture of reviving industry and eager innocence always new to me. The birds' notes, so often heard, still waken new ideas : the herds are led into the fields : the peasant bends his eye upon his plough. Every thing lives and moves ; and, in every creature's mind, it seems as it were morning. Towards evening, I begin to roam abroad ; from the park into the meadows. And sometimes returning, I pause to look at the village boys and girls as they play. Then do I bless their innocence, and pray to Heaven those laughing, thoughtless hours could be their lot for ever. Bar. This is excellent ! But these are summer amuse ments. The winter ! the winter ! Mrs. H. Why for ever picture winter like old age, torpid, tedious, and uncheerful ? Winter has its own delights : this is the time to instruct and mend the mind, by reading and reflection. At this season, too, I often take my harp, and amuse myself by playing or singing the little favourite airs that remind me of the past, or solicit hope for the future. Bar. Happy indeed are they who can thus create and vary their own pleasures and employments ! Enter Petee, l. Pet.

Nay, no false delicacy, madam. Allow him to vent the feelings of his heart ; and permit me to witness a scene which convinces me, even more powerfully than your con versation, how nobly you employ your time. Speak, old man. Tob.

To-day, for the first time, I have returned thanks in presence of the sun : and now I come to you, noble lady ; let me drop my tears upon your charitable hand. For your sake, Heaven has blessed my latter days. The Stranger, too, who lives near me, has given me a purse of gold to buy my son's release. I am on my way to the city : I shall purchase my Robert's release. Then I shall have an honest daughter-in-law ; and you, if ever after that you pass our happy cottage, oh ! what must you feel when you say to yourself, \" This is my work !\" Mrs. H.

Who is she ? I beseech you, sister, be serious. There is a time for all things. Countess. Bless us ! Why, you look as if you were going to raise a spirit. Don't fix your eyes so earnestly. Well, if I am to be serious, I obey. I do not know who Mrs. Haller is, as I have already told you ; but what I do know of her shall not be concealed from you. It may now be three years ago, when, one evening, about twilight, a lady was announced, who wished to speak to me in private. Mrs. Haller appeared, with all that grace and modesty which have enchanted you. Her features, at that moment, bore keener marks of the sorrow and confusion, which have since settled into gentle melancholy. She threw herself at my feet, and besought me to save a wretch, who was on the brink of despair. She told me she had heard much of my benevolence, and offered herself as a servant to attend me. I endeavoured to dive into the cause of her sufferings, but in vain. She concealed her secret, yet opened to me more and more each day a heart, chosen by Virtue as her temple, and an understanding improved by the most refined attain ments. She no longer remained my servant, but became my"], [256, "224 THE STEANGEE. friend ; and, by her own desire, has ever since resided here. (Curtsying.) Brother, I have done. Bar.

You surely would not attempt to present her to \u2014 Bar. Object as you will \u2014 my answer is \u2014 I love. Sister, you see a man before you, who \u2014 Countess. Who wants a wife. Bar. No ; who has deliberately poised advantage against disadvantage ; domestic ease and comfort against the false gaieties of fashion. I can withdraw into the country. I need no honours to make my tenants happy, and my heart will teach me to make their happiness my own. With such a wife as this, children who resemble her, and fortune enough to spread comfort around me, what would the soul of man have more ? Countess. This is all vastly fine. I admire your plan ; only you seem to have forgotten one trifling circumstance. Bar. And that is ? \u2014 Countess. Whether Mrs. Haller will have you or not. Bar. There, sister, I just want your assistance. \u2014 (Seizing her hand.) \u2014 Good Henrietta ! Countess. Well, here's my hand. I'll do all I can for you. \u2014 St ! We had near been overheard.

Yes, I have lost him ! But \u2014 I had children, too. Countess. Enough ! \u2014 enough ! Your crime was youth and inexperience : your heart never was, never could be concerned in it. Mrs. S.

Dear madam, though it's seven long years since you left us for foreign parts, there's hardly been a day that I haven't sometimes thought of you. Fel. I have not deserved your thoughts, Sophy. I fear me, travel, with its new objects, has made me slight old friends in Derbyshire. Sop. Just what my poor mother told me, madam. She used to say, \" Sophy, child, where is the use in fuming and fidgeting? Thou knowest the Lady Felicia, though she was a pretty babe, and thy foster-sister, now she 'a a woman grown, mus'n't think of folks like us.

Did he win your love, and then desert you ? Sop. He didn't desert me, madam. Fel. How then ? Sop. We were to be married; but folks would meddle. The parson \u2014 I dare say, he meant well \u2014 talked to us of early troubles, and advised us to get money first ; and so, poor Simon set off to a place here in London ; and, for my part, I don't see what the parson had to do with it, except to marry us, and leave the rest to ourselves.

Beyond a doubt. \u2014 I've taken a liking to Fanny, and it would not be honourable in me not to say so. Sus. Taking a liking to her ! You own it then ? Bil. I adores her ! Sus. And this you call acting honourably. Why, a fort night ago, you said as how you adored me. Bil. I can't call to mind no such thing. Sus. Can't you; but I shall make you call it to mind sir, before I've done with you. Do you think as how you are to chop and change sweethearts like the Grand Turk ? Who are you, I wonder ? Bil. I wish you could tell me, Mrs. Susan. I am a young ; we have made out who my mother was, but, for anything you know, my father may be a great nobleman, and it wouldn't be right of me to let down the family. Sus. Nobleman ! a rare fellow for the son of a nobleman ! Upon my word, you sentimental chaps have a pretty way of getting out of your rogueries \u2014 that's a sure thing.

My own concerns touches me more nearer than any- body else's. Mrs. B. Sir, you must learn to mind your business \u2014 earn your livelihood. Recollect yourself : didn't my hus- band, the late Mr. Bell, take you up, a poor deserted babby, at his door ? Bil, The late Mr. Bell had tho bowels of compassion. Mrs. B. He wasn't rich ; but didn't he give you a very decent middling sort of education ? Bil. A very middling education, indeed. Mrs. B. It ought to have been a good one. Didn't he send you to cousin Luberly, the great Yorkshire grazier, and schoolmaster! You don't mean to asperse cousin Luberly ? \u2014 you can't complain of his treatment, I'm sure. Bil. I complains of nothing : I sits like Patience on the monument. Mrs. B. You were better fed than taught, sir ! Bil. I was, and half- starved into the bargain. Mrs. B. Not like the poor London lads ; you had plenty of air and exercise. Don't you remember how you used to run about among the sheep upon the long common ? Bil. Yes, I remember the long common, and I remember the short commons. Them hills weren't eloth'd with much werder; it was sharp work, both for the boys and the beasts \u2014 we were brothers in adversity. I used to lose myself, ruminating ; and when old Luberly called \" Billy!\" me and the goat didn't know which was which, and so run a race for the tater parings. Mrs. B.

Mrs. B. Never doubt him ! Eug. We are very much obliged to you for keeping the secret so close. Mrs. B . You ought child : here has been a deal of curiosity about you, I promise you : one tells me he never heard of such a niece before \u2014 another, that you must have been brought up to better things \u2014 and a third, Mr. Curtis, for instance, advises me to take care of your character, for that all the world is not like Mr. Sandford, his master, and that the admiral has been a sad rake, in his time, to his certain knowledge. Eug. I warrant him : as he has sent for me again, I'll attend him.

A critical subject, Mr. CurtiB ? Cur. Yes ; an affair of secrecy that concerns myself. I have now lived in this family twenty years, and I think it's high time to retire, and be my own master ; in short, Mrs. Bell, to get married and settled. Mrs. B. Dear, Mr. Curtis ! Cur. Yes ; but there lies a matter on my conscience of which I must first unburthen myself by an honest con fession ; and you, Mrs. Bell, are the person whom 1 have selected. Mrs. B. For your confession?

Have you no regret at leaving y our country ? I'm for seeing you married, child ! \u2014 is there no young favourite left behind ? Eug. Oh, no, sir ! Since I lost my father, I have no friend left there, sir ! Here, I may find others ; and, since you are good enough to wish me a husband, he must he of this part of the world, if you please, sir ! Why should I not be near you, sir, and do you all the service I can \u2014 I should be as careful of your comfort and happiness, as if you were my own father. Adm. (aside.) She has me. A bosom of adamant could not stand against her. \u2014 Wait a moment. \u2014 Yet all this, in stead of shaking my resolution, ought to strengthen it. \u2014 (Mrs. Bell is seen at door in fiat.) \u2014 Here comes her aunt, with her I may be more courageous. Eug. There's my aunt, sir/she'll tell you. Adm. Come in, Mrs. Bell, \u2014 come this way. Enter Mrs. Bell. Fanny, you may retire. Eug. Are you angry still, sir ? Adm. No, no, I'm not angry, \u2014 but get you gone. Eug. I tremble \u2014 what has happened ? Tho more I know him, the more I love him, and dread his displeasure. [Exit, L. Adm.

Mrs. B. Leave us ? Adm. Not a word! 'tis my desire \u2014 comply with it! You know the consequence \u2014 this very night she must go ! Mrs. B. Dear me ! so much as I love her ! Adm. Hark'e ! I love her as much as you do, and am as sorry to lose sight of her. I have my reasons \u2014 don't vex me by asking them \u2014 leave me, and obey ! Mrs. B. (aside) Dear young lady, what will she say to this ? [Exit, L. Adm. That business is settled. I have overcome every lurking weakness, and secured the repose of my family. The girl has turned my wits, as well as my son's, and almost made us rivals in the heart of a chambermaid. Enter Charles, Lauea, and Sandfoed, b. Adm. WeD, young gentleman, and you, madam, what crotchet has crept into your heads ? \u2014 Have you made up your minds ? Cha. Sir, if \u2014 \u25a0 Adm. No ifs, puppy! The solicitor's clerk is in the house with the marriage articles ; I know your secret, sir, and poor Laura is too proud to resent the change it has produced in you, though I dare say her heart is bursting with rage and mortification. \u2014 (Crosses to Lauea, r.) \u2014 But, calm your feelings, and be comforted \u2014 he shall marry you, and, what's more, damme, he shall love you too, or the whole Consistory Court, Doctors, and Proctors, shall be employed to make him. Lau. Dear uncle, pray don't force him, for, as matters stand, I assure you, the marriage is quite impossible. Adm. Impossible ! What do you mean ? Eug. (without, L.) Let me pass \u2014 I will speak to him ! Adm. Again ! Lau. What wild step is this ? Cha. Listen! 1 12"], [410, "370 SWEETHEARTS and wives. Enter Eugenia, l., crosses to Admiral. Eug. Oh, sir ! have I heard rightly \u2014 is it you that have given these orders, that cut me to the heart ? \u2014 You, so good and so generous, that have taken such pains to make me love you, and then banish me for so doing ? \u2014 But I'll not go ! \u2014 Oh ! never, never ! I must be ever near you \u2014 ever look up to you as a friend, a protector, a father ! Adm. This is more than I can bear \u2014 Leave me, child ! Cha. Listen to her, sir. Adm. Peace ! libertine ! I have heard too much ! Eug. I know the cause of your displeasure \u2014 suspicion pursues me, with some reason \u2014 I approach you in a character which is not my own, but for no dishonest purpose ; \u2014 I am neither low-born nor indigent. You had an early friend, who has long lived in a distant country, his name was \u2014 Adm. Melbourn? Eug. Yes, sir ! Adm. I loved him as a brother! \u2014 Jack Melbourn \u2014 we were class-fellows, boon and bottle friends, and rubbed away the bloom of life together. \u2014 We were of impetuous spirits, and a trifle divided us : \u2014 a word, aggravated by the mischief-makers of this meddling world : \u2014 but I have loved him ever \u2014 God bless him ! Eug. If you loved the father you will not reject his child. (Kneels.) Adm. You the daughter of Jack Melbourne ! Where \u2014 where is he ? Eug. Where he no longer feels the bitterness of poisoned friendship. Adm. Dead? Eug, Alas, yes ! \u2014 but he bequeathed to you an affection unaltered as your own. A friend was at his bedside with him : he charged me to come hither. \" I leave you,\" said he, \" my child, but not an orphan.

My heart was your's at once \u2014 the surviving spirit of my old friend was the unconscious charm : now I recognize it in every look and feature. Eug. Indeed, sir! Cha. All's safe now, I hope. Adm. But, 'sdeath ! why do I see you descend to this masquerade ? Eug. Oh ! that's another matter, sir ; you know you recommended me to find a lover ? Adm. A superfluous injunction; I dare say you had one. Eug. I had ; \u2014 the friend who attended my dying father ; but his family \u2014 Adm. His family! what family could oppose such a choice? Eug. They had other prospects. Adm. They shall renounce them then ! Who are they ? I'll talk to them \u2014 I'll take it all upon myself. Let them dare insult your feelings in my presence!

You scoundrel! (Embraces Eugenia.) You dear angel ! How dare you, sir, to marry a ward of mine, with- out my consent ? Cha. Wouldn't you have done the same, sir ? Adm. I'll be damned if I wouldn't ! Your wife's a pro- digy, for she's the first that ever made me forget character and wink at an act of mutiny. Eug. We'll be very obedient for the future, sir! Adin Obedient ! As you've served your time before the mast, why I'll lay up, and you shall be commander-in-chief. (Joining hands) Lau. (coming down) And what's to become of me, sir ? Adm.

If, sir, I might venture to offer myself. \u2014 Adm. You're very accommodating! upon my soul, I'm very much obliged! (To Laura.) What am I to answer? Lau. Whatever you think proper, sir. Adm. Whatever I \u2014 Why, you barefaced baggage! so you've been plotting against me, too! You're all alike. Well, well ! I see Fortune has provided better for me than I could do for myself; for, instead of making me the father of two, she has made me a father of four. San. And who's to father these four ? Enter Susan, Billy, Mrs. Bell, and Curtis. Bil, I come to introduce \u2014 Adm. Whom, cub ? Bil. The two Mr. and Mrs. Curtises, to your favour. Adm. Two Mr. and Mrs. Curtises ? \u2014 Booby what do you mean? Bil. Why, genteelly speaking, we're leading one another to the Aalter. Adm. What for ? Bil. To change our predomination. Adm.
