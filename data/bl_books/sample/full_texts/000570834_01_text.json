W HEN this Comedy was put into Mr. Garrick's hands, it was delivered to him as a piece, the chief merit of which conlifted in the Intrigue ; and, as fuch, he agreed with the Author, that it was a very great curiollty. It muft be owned, indeed, in juftice to his difcernment, that he thought the exhibition of it a hazardous attempt ; however, he at the fame time declared, that if the Play did not too far clafh with the prejudices of pre vailing tafte, he thought it had an undoubted right to fuccefs. On what ground the writer founded his hopes, that thefe prejudices would not be unreafonably urged againft it ; or, if they were, that his Comedy would in the end get the better of them ; a fhort account of the piece from whence he took it, will pro bably be the beft explanation. TkS"], [8, "PREFACE: 6 1Th\u00a3 original of the Play, now laid before the public, is called El ' Ef con dido y la Tapada, The Hidden Man and the Veil'd Woman ; and is counted the mafter-piece o\u00a3 the mofl famous among the Spanifh Dramatic Poets, Don Pedro Calderon de la Barca ; who, through Moliere, Corneille, Le Sage, Boiffy, &c. has provided Vanbrugh, Centlivre, Cibber, and Steel, With ThcMiftake, The Falfe Friend, The Wonder, The Bufy Body, The Kind Impoftor, The Lady's I'hilofophy, and The Lying Lover, all Englifh Comedies, which have been received upon the ftage with the warmeft marks of approbation. However, neither thefe former inftances of Calderon's favourable reception among us, nor the forcible manner in which the writer was ftruck, when he firft perufed this parti cular Comedy of his, were the fole motives that induced him to adopt it. In a little French book, called Jiifloire des Fetes Gallantes des Rois de France, he found it praifed as a miracle of invention and dramatic iituations ; and that in the year 1668 it was one of the plays that had been performed during the famous feaft at Verfailles, given by Louis XIV. to his court, and a vaft concourfe of the nrft people in Europe. In another book, where it is mentioned, he found that in November 1716 it was again put into French, and acted under the title of L' Am ant Cache & la Dame VoiUe, nrft at the caftle of the celebrated Marefchal"], [9, "PREFACE 7 Marefchal ' No allies, in honour of his daughter's marriage with Prince Charles ; and afterwards by the comedians in Paris, (to whom the Marefchal made it a prefent) with the greateffc fuccefs. Laftly, in the year 1769, it was once more tranllated into the French language, hy Monf. Lanquit, a Counfellor of Parliament, and an excellent writer and critic ; who, after much praife of the poet and the piece, (which he names La Cloifon, The Pannel) fpeaking of Don Carlos and Mufkato, being locked up in the unfurnifhed houfe, he fays, \" it *' is an incident the moft theatrical that can \" be imagined, and nothing is fo inerefting '* and fo lingular as the fituations it produces. \" But I fhall perhaps be told, that thefe tef timonies in favour of the Original may ftill leave the Copy without excufe ; and as I be lieve they who diflike the Play will hardly take my word, when I tell them I have done it no harm, I muft refer them to the Spanifh original, or the French tranflation, (which is literal) to enable them to decide the point. I fhall only add, in this place, that the critics have long agreed to make a diftinction be tween Comedies of Character and Comedies pf Intrigue ; aqd notwithstanding thefe are undoubtedly the beft, which are compofed qf a due portion of both, I never understood, from all I have read about the matter, that Comedy forfeited her name by attaching her felf to either, particularly the latter ; in which the"], [10, "PREFACE. 8 the great difficulty of the dramatic art feems to lie.

These proportions agreed to, I hope I fhall be pardoned for thinking that a reader, fpedtator, not violently exceptions, who will fit down with a hearty defire to be amufed, may find great entertainment from Calderon's Play.

But, upon the whole, I know not whether abfolutely to believe, or totally to difcredit it. I find, both the young men were known for your admirers; and the report certainly ran, that you were the lady prefent at the fatal difpute ; how ever, being veiled, in the confusion that enfued upon Don Alonzo's falling, the woman, whoever fhe was, efcaped without being pofitively known.

Well then, Sir, I give you my word, and I expect you will rely upon it, that, whatever wicked and idle ftories might be propagated, I was not the lady prefent, when the two cavaliers you mention fought.

About an hour ago, my coufin Marcella and her maid, were overturned in a coach, juft by my uncle's houfe ; going out to their affiltance, we met two men, who endeavoured to fhun us; coming back, we crofted them again ; and by the light of the flambeaux, which fell directly on their faces, I faw and knew one of them to be Don Carlos.
