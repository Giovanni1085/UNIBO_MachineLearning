DUNDEE : PRINTED AT THE ADVERTISER OFFICE, BANK STREET. 18 7 3."], [8, ""], [9, "PREFACE. Some time ago a wish was kindly expressed by several of my friends, and others who had read my verses as they appeared in print, that I should publish them in a collected form. The idea of having a book of my own, I admit, was not easily got rid of, so, after a little deliberation and reflection, I determined to venture into the realms of authorship. Such an under taking is, in these times, rather hazardous for an unknown author to engage in ; but still I had the hope, in common with other warblers, that there might be room enough left to pipe what little song there was in me. In this hope the present adventure is made ; and the result, for better or worse, is now beyond the control of the Author and in the hands of the Public, whose verdict I now submissively await. The Poems in this collection have, for the most part, already appeared in the pages of the People's Friend, under the nnm-de-plume \" Surface man ;\" and I think it but just to myself to state that this title truly designates the nature of my calling \u2014 I being but a humble son of toil, working with pick and shovel on the railway. Other Poems, which appeared in several of the London Magazines, are, by the kind permission of the Publishers, inserted in the volume ; and these, with a consider able number of others which have never appeared in print before, consti tute the collection which I now offer to the Public, in the hope that, as I have had great delight in the writing of them, the reader may have \u2014 though in a less degree \u2014 a pleasure in their perusal."], [10, "IV PREFACE. I leave the Poems, then, to those who, like myself, have to toil for their daily bread ; and if my verses influence them in the slightest degree towards a higher reverence for the \" nobility of labour, the long pedigree of toil, \" I shall tear the account which, more or less, stands between the author and his readers, and, like the gnome in the German story, fling it in their faces with these two words written upon it \u2014 \" Fully paid.\" I cannot conclude without touching upon a duty which is heavier than I at first had imagined \u2014 I mean the tendering of my thanks to all my friends, far and near, who generously came forward to aid me in the launch of my little book. I have no set words in which to couch my gratitude to them. I can only request them to fancy what, in my inability to express, I have left unsaid."], [11, "CONTENTS. Page.

RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO MT FELLOW-WORKERS WITH PICK AND SHOVEL EVERTWHERE. \" Let each man honour his workmanship\u2014 his Can-do.\" \u2014 Carlyle. fET us sing, my toiling Brothers, with our rough, rude voice a song That shall live behind, nor do us in the after ages wrong, But forever throb and whisper strength to nerve our fellow kind As they rise to fill our footsteps and the space we leave behind. What though hand and form be rugged ? better then for Labour's mart \u2014 I have never heard that Nature changed the colour of the heart\u2014 The God above hath made us one in flesh and blood with kings, But the lower use is ours, and all the force of rougher things. Then, my Brothers, sing to Labour, as the sun-brown'd giant stands Like an Atlas with the world shaking in his mighty hands ; Brawny arm'd, and broad, and swarthy, keeping in with shout and groan, In the arch of life the keystone that the world may thunder on ; Ever toiling, ever sweating, ever knowing that to day Is the footstool for the coming years to reach a higher sway. A"], [16, "2 A SONG OF LABOUR. Up, then, we, his rugged children, as the big hours move and pant, For that cannot be but noble what he claims and cannot want : Sing, and let his myriad voices bear the burden far along, While we hail the mighty engine as the spirit of our song ! Arm to arm, and let the metals into proper range be thrown, Let us smooth the iron pathway to the monster comii ig on. Lo ! he dawns adown the distance, and his iron footway rings As he bounds, a wander'd meteor, muffled up in smoky wings \u2014 Earth beneath his mighty footsteps trembles at the sudden load, As of old the field Scamander at the falling of the god. Give him freedom, strength he needs not, only space and bound to fly, As at night, in stany silence, glides a planet through the sky \u2014 Thus he comes, the earth-born splendour, and with sudden shriek and gasp On he flames, the Jove of Commerce, with the lightnings in his grasp. 0, my Brothers, this is something, in the fret and rush of days, Worthy of our love and wonder, and the throbbing out of praise ; Then another wilder p\u00e6an for this march of thought and mind, Some ecstatic dithyrambus that shall deify our kind. Arm to arm, and let the metals into proper range be thrown, I Let us shape the iron pathway for the monster coming on ; Make his footing sure and steady, fitting for a thing like him, Rolling out his seven-leagued paces smoother than a bird can skim ; Drawing city unto city, flinging with his grasp of steel Nations into shape and method, till his muscles shake and reel ; Stretching outward, like Briareus, hundred arms of sudden stroke, Shooting upward to the heavens coiling Laocoons of smoke ; Touching, like the gods of fable, all things into noble strife As before the heated sculptor flash'd the statue into life. 0, what strength shall be his portion in the coming reach of time, When his sinews swell and ripen into firm and perfect prime, He shall be the untired monster that like Gulliver shall lead Busy peoples to each other only with an iron thread. Heart ! but this old world rolls onward through the shadows of the years, Swift as fell the reckless Ph\u00e6ton headlong through the startled spheres ;"], [17, "A SONG OF LABOUR. 3 And along with it we struggle, shaping bounds we slowly reach, For this knowledge is a master whose first aim is to unteach. So, he moves with time and patience, working with a careful heed, Growing more and more in earnest when he moulds the perfect deed ; Therefore guide him well, and listen to his slightest spoken word, For a simple note will sometimes lead us to a fuller chord ; And the finish'd triumph with us shall a hundredfold repay All the toil, and search, and panting for the source of purer day. \" But,\" says one who still will murmur in the camp of brother- hood, \" Progress comes with tardy footsteps, and can do the grave no good.\" There but spoke the Cynic, Brothers, curbing down with strongest steel All the width of human purpose, all that brain can do and feel ; Scorning ever outward action, but to wrap himself in toils Spun to catch the things that wither, spun to catch the dust that soils. Shame on such ! they are not worthy of the common breath they draw, Since with it they make existence wither to a narrow law. Wider range and freer action, nobler maxims for my breath ; I would wish my fellows success from the very jaws of death : Death ! a moment's cunning darkness flung across the trembling eyes As we flash into the spirit cradled in a wild surprise. Then what motions come upon us, golden laws of sudden calm, Raining down eternal silence, raining down eternal balm. Dare I fix my vision further, deeming that we mould this mind, But to look in steady splendour on the toiling of our kind . Heart ! but this were something nobler than the poet ever felt When the fought-for happy laurel clasp'd his forehead like a belt ; When the liquid fire of genius, rainbow colour'd, flash'd and glow'd All its mighty beams above him with the splendour of a god : Wilder in its stretch and grandeur than the brain could ever dream To look down upon our fellows from some planet's blinding gleam, Watching with seraphic vision, grasping with delighted soul All the goals to which they hurry as the moments shake and roll, Linking with an unseen quickness vigour, to the tasks they do, Touching each with new impulses as a nobler comes in view. a 2"], [18, "4 A SONG OF LABOUR. Then when triumph crowns their striving, start to hear the heavens sublime, Fill its azure arch with plaudits rushing from the throat of time ; And to hear the poets singing far above the rush of feet Epithalamiums of madness when the links of success meet. This is frenzy, and the overstretching of unhealthy strings, Let us touch a chord that trembles to the breath of higher things. Rash in him who sings unworthy, looking not within his heart For the counsel that should guide him to the honours of his art. \" Sing you thus .\" I hear you question, and I answer you again, I but fit me to that measure chance flings blindly down on men, Which requires nor heart nor passion, but the will that makes a voice \u2014 Mighty poets sing by impulse, and the lesser but by choice. \" Yet you claim the meed of poet .\" and I answer firm and strong, Count me only as a poet, Brothers, while I sing this song. Arm to arm, and let the metals into proper range be thrown, Let us shape the iron pathway for the monster coming on. What though we be feeble puppets with a little vigour crown'd, Yet this task is ours, to fence his footsteps into proper bound ; Therefore guide him well, nor tamper with the thread that leads his powers, Since the splendour of his mission flings a dignity on ours. As the silent sage at midnight shapes his cunning thoughts to smoothe Pathways through the world's jungle for the steady tramp of truth ; As the pioneer that fells the sounding forest tree by tree, With a mighty thought that trembles to the settlement to be ; As the sentinel who slowly paces as the night hours fly, With the lives of breathing thousands hanging on his watchful eye; As within the field of Sempach in the bleeding Swiss's breast Freedom found her purple dwelling, giving to a nation rest ; As the coral insect toiling in the ocean's mighty vast Rears a giant's labour upward through the swaying surge at last ; So the specks that dot existence, seeming blind and aimless still, Knit in one, are levers waiting for the touch of thought and will. Thus are we but toiling units, rough at heart and brown in face, Xoble only to be useful, lowly in a lowly place ;"], [19, "A SONG OF LABOUR. 5 Filling up the ruts existence furrows with his heavy wain, That the nobler hearts behind may start and sow the fruitful gram ; For we clothe with rougher muscle circles of a mighty whole, Moving at the touch of fellows with a greater breadth of soul. But I crave not higher mission than to shape the ends they think, Deeming I am all but godlike in the holding of a link. And this link for ever widens, as their restless spirits teach, Till it forms a chain of union clanking from the heart of each ; Break it and a gap arises never seen until it broke, As the wires, when cut, are traitors to the sentence-breathing shock ; Heedless of such bond of union grapple we with erring mind, Feeling not the mighty impulse streaming from our greater kind, Which, like to the spreading glory waiting on the dying sun, Shoots along this link that binds us till we feel ourselves as one ; And we grow into their triumph as their works rise up sublime, Like a book that lies before you glowing with some poet's rhyme ; And the spirit of the minstrel, leaping distance, shoots along, With a monarch's footsteps ringing through the pathways of his song. Thus the mighty who have labour'd in the ages sunk behind Link their spirit to that purpose which they left among their kind; And forever as the groaning world tramples under foot Hydras born of sleeping Wisdom when it pleas'd her to be mute ; And wherever slow Improvement wanders with a laggard's pace \u2014 Like the Cynic with his lantern roaming in the market-place \u2014 There their power of brain is busy, bringing with its potent rod Genii from all points of heaven, and set them working with a nod. In the whirl and sweep of traffic, in the long and restless street, Multitudinous with echoes ringing from a thousand feet ; In the clash and clank of hammers, in the anvil's busy sound, In the belt that like a serpent whirls in hot pursuit around ; In the crash of tooth and pinion slowly forming linked rounds ; In the mighty beam that labours, like a Hercules set in bounds ; In the slightest pull of steam that specks the ocean far away ; In the sail that boasts a shadow hanging in the lucent bay ; In the furnace darting upward glowing gleams to greet the skies, Till they start at such a welcome with a flush of red surprise ; In whatever rises up for myriad use with loud acclaim ; In whatever sets for Progress stepping-stones to reach her aim."], [20, "6 A SONG OF LABOUR. But it hath a deeper meaning, and a broader strength and skill, In the clanking of the rail, and in the engine's thunder still ; For the might of what our fellows can with cunning fingers frame Moves with him as on he flashes in great bursts of smoke and flame. Lo, at times as on he strides a quick and glowing frenzy steals From his sinews swift as light, and from the roar and rush of wheels, Quick as when the far-off mountains shake themselves from summer mist, Or the virtue to the woman when she touch'd the hem of Christ \u2014 Filling all the soul within me with a wonder at my kind, And the nerve and battle onward of this ever-restless mind. In such fits and heats I wander half a step before the years, Taking to myself the vision forethought sets apart for seers ; And I see a healthier colour, promise of a Titan's prime, And a mightier sinew working on the naked arm of Time ; And behind him roars nor cannon, nor the champ of fretting steed, But the nations leaning forward ready for the swordless deed. But he waves them back and questions, \" Am not I the thought and type That shall shake the perfect blossom, knowing when the seed is ripe . Am I not the unseen symbol giving every moment birth, Breathing with a finger resting on the iron pulse of earth, Waiting till I feel a calmer action in the glowing vein, And a wider stretch of bosonTere I stoop to sow the grain 1\" This he whispers, and forever as he shakes his restless wings Silent sands within his hour-glass slip away like human things. But the cycles hid behind him, peering from their shadows still, Wear upon their brow a purpose which they tremble to fulfil ; Then, for songs to hail their coming, lyrics from some burning heart Beating with the perfect mission, glowing with the given art. Higher task is not for poets than to touch with sounding chords Mighty Memnons of advance, and shape their whispers into words. This the task for which the laurel glitters, as upon the thorn Woven webs of silky slightness swaying in the flush of morn. Let him take such wreath unblushing, knowing that it is his right, But his inspiration only as he feels his given might. Then, when round his brow its coolness circles with inspiring clasp, Let his thoughts take deeper music, wider range, and higher grasp ;"], [21, "7 A SONG OF LABOUR. Let him sing the better yearning running through our noble strife, As from bough to bough the juices creeping start the buds to life ; And the promise growing fuller with the rounding of each year \u2014 0, the future is a giant. 'Tis his shadow we have here ! What though Science fills her nectar lavishly in golden cups, And the earth like a Bacchante all unwitting reels and sups ; She is yet a village maiden, Nature touching not her life, Girt in dreams of busy childhood, knowing not the aim of wife ; Wearing simple vesture loose in fold that opens to disclose Breasts that nurse a wish to blossom like the twin buds of a rose. Then what wonders will they suckle when the juices in her blood Slowly swell their balmy outline to the round of womanhood : Like the gods that from Olympus stole into the arms of earth, Made their nature as a mortal's, and a monster was the birth ; So the thought and might of doing, slipping into her embrace, Shall be fruitful, and a wonder help the labour of our race. But from him of double semblance shall she keep the wish'd-for prize, Heeding not the shallow purpose peering out from narrow eyes ; But to him who toils and battles with an earnest, broad desire, She shall give her fruitful favours, and our fellows shall be higher \u2014 Higher in the broader feeling, in the wider aims that come, Pledging all their good to mankind, ever potent, ever dumb. They shall ride, like one in armour, through the wastes and fens of life, Giving battle wherever error rears a lance and shield for strife. They shall usher in the primal order of the happy earth, Working with their cunning only that a good may be the birth. This shall Science do as earnest of her firm and matron prime, When her passion fruits are growing strong in limb to wrestle time ; They shall watch her slightest motion as she lifts her magic wand, Rush like Ariels at her nod, and roll the earth into her hand. Who are they that curb their vision, lifting up with finger tips Coloured glass and watch her crying that she reels into eclipse ? Narrow hearts that will not widen, souls that in their shells of clay Flicker up like feeble tapers, but to pass in smoke away ; Prophets that should walk this world with their evil croakings wrung As the shadows swept by Dante in the hell he made and sung ;"], [22, "8 A SONG OF LABOUR. Ghostly faces looking backward through the shadows thick and vast, Like Remorse upon a deathbed writhing round to view the past. Such should be their doom who torture Wisdom into selfish deeds, Deeming that the earth should wither to give space to sow their creeds. This were faith in scope and keeping with the brute's within his den ; Let them give their creeds to idiots, but the world unto men : What is all this flash of triumph, from our very footsteps brought, But the promise of a brighter lying yet unknown to thought \u2014 Brighter in the strength to usher in the many varied use, As a single bud foreruns a thousand forming in the juice. Yet we grow apace and prosper : All that hath a strength and nerve Is, like Samson taken captive, made to bow the knee and serve ; And we peer with deepest cunning into seeming useless things, Train them to a little method, and a miracle upsprings. Lo, the motion of a finger trifling with a simple wire Shakes the nations into whispers ere a moment can expire ; And a slight and simple needle shaking in its paltry case Turns the boundless stretch of ocean to a fearless dwelling-place. Thus we overleap those wonders kept by ever niggard time, Heirlooms of the early worlds in the acme of their prime ; Ah, if they could look upon us from the gloom and dust of years, Feel our mighty grasp and purpose as the goal we strive for nears j See the very germ, yet hidden when they pass'd in death away, Growing into perfect blossom with their fellows yet in clay \u2014 Think you would they turn in wonder to the calm of their abodes, Blush at all their strength, and worship those who toil' d below as gods. This is but a wilder fancy creeping through our rugged song ; Yet a burst of rhythmic madness cannot do our fellows wrong, For in them is nerve and action, will to do and will to dare, And the demons of their magic work their wonders everywhere. Hark ! as onward rolls the world with a rough and toiling sound, All their voices swell and mingle in triumphal hymns around. Come they from the dash of paddles urging through the spray and foam, Freights of earnest bosoms outward, freights of smiling faces home ; From the lunge of pistons working scant of room to breathe and pant Yet like slaves do all the feats their ever cunning masters want ;"], [23, "9 A SONG OF LABOUR. From the whirring of the spindle in the hot and dusty room, From the mazes of the wheel, and from the complicated loom, From the furnace belching outward molten forms at their desire, Like Enceladus upspringing through his hill of smoke and fire : Mighty sounds are these, but mightier rush with everlasting hail From the thunder of the engine and the clanking of the rail. Ah ! the monster that shall mould and make the coming cycles strong \u2014 Shame on me that could desert the inspiration of my song ! So, another p\u00e6an, Brothers, ere the fancy sinks away, Ere we take the voiceless measure ranging through our toiling day. Arm to arm, and lay the metals, glowing but with one desire \u2014 To do honour to the mightiest of the worshippers of fire. All the great in early fable, mighty-pulsing Anakim, All the thew'd and swarthy Cj'clops are as nothing unto him. Yet he seeks our aid and mutters, shaking in his sudden wrath- Give me but a hand to guide me, give me but a fitting path. And he foams and shrieks in triumph as at every bound and rasp, Like twin threads laid out in distance, all the iron meets his grasp. Dare we, then, as unto mortals, whisper fear and death to him, When such breadth of nerve like lightning flashes through his heart and limb ; When, within his throbbing bosom, bound with glowing links of fire, Lies his wildest being panting with the thoughts that cannot tire ; And they hiss, and leap, and flicker, licking up with fiery breath Strength to feed his sinews working like the flash of swords beneath . 0, I rise from out my weakness as he flares along my view, And I deem that I am mighty in the labour others do ; For the Frankensteins who made him part by part and limb by limb Had the same soul beating in them as my own at seeing him. Arm to arm, then, lay the metals, let him roll along the rods, ./' Like Prometheus through the heavens rushing from the angry gods. Lo ! I look into the ages that in spirit we may see When the hand of death hath stripp'd us from this warp o\u00a3 \u2022\u25a0'action free, And I see this monster stretching his untiring sinews still, Keeping all his strength, but blindly giving unto men his will ; And they \u2014 restless, feeble puppets \u2014 he not deeming them aaneuch, Move his hon footsteps onward with a paltry finger touch ; \u2022"], [24, "10 A SONG OF LABOUR. And they link him unto wonders, and their triumphs still increase Till some awe-struck fellow whispers \" It were time for us to cease.\" But they turn and shout an answer, high rebuke in all its tone, \" Shame, and have another planet growing mightier than our own Out on such a craven's whisper, all unworthy of our powers, And this monster toiling with us, making all his being ours. Forward, then, and let us fashion wider space for his career, Till the old earth reels and staggers as his sounding footsteps near.\" Then they turn to all their labour, shaping as their thought will speak Pathways into which he glides with iron grasp and madden'd shriek ; And forever as their success brings a wilder aim in view, Flashes out by fits a wonder at the miracles they do. Said we not the future's shadow only falls upon us here As a cloud's upon a hill when all the rest is shining clear ? But to them, our larger fellows of the ages yet to be, He shall rise, as gods are statured, huge of limb, and broad, and free ; And in frenzy they shall hail him, bring their trophies to his feet, Then rush on in throngs, and strive to make their wondrous gains complete : While through all their fret and hurry he, the monster of our song, With the spot of the Immortals shall in thunder flash along, Clasping all things in his vigour, as a serpent flings his coil, Labour's mightiest Epic rolling through the world's heart of toil."], [25, "11 A LOVE RETROSPECT. A LOVE RETROSPECT. \"_0 meines Lebens goldne zeit.\" \u2014 Schiller. \u00a3\\ THE youth of love and madness ! let me sing another song T.7 Ere the cynic grows upon me, and I do the world wrong. Silver moonlight sleeping over fairy realms to human eyes, Like the garments of an angel trailing from the starry skies ; Shadows lying in the distance, balmy as the breath of winds ; Moonbeams stealing sweetly through them, like the thoughts through poets' minds ; River with its thousand wavelets gliding bright as silver bars, With a quiet stretch of bosom for the holding of the stars. Not a sound to fret the silence \u2014 all as still as still can be, Save at times a low faint murmur from the trembling aspen tree. I, a poet, hers am waiting, in the hush of all this night, For the glimmer of a maiden, and the sound of footsteps light ; Oh she tarries, and I weary, and the hours are strangely long \u2014 I will slip into the silence, and be busy with a song : Come, 0 heart, within this bosom downward from thy purple throne, Take a happy blushing maid, and set her in thy stead thereon ; Then let all thy purest being ever watch her, as above Glow's and gleams the winged cherub angel of the passions \u2014 Love. Thou shalt guide her feet in pathways that shall lead to quiet days, Drink the tearlike raptures from her eyes, and think it noble praise ; And thy soul shall be a mirror, taking every mood of hers, While the thoughts that stir thy pulses \u2014 let them bow her worshippers, She shall pay thee back in blessings manifold through all thy life \u2014 \u25a0 Stand upon the hearth, an angel smiling when you call her \" wife.\" Then the faith that works within thee shall have firmer root and soil, And the heavens above come nearer as you both together toil. Both thy lives shall mix and mingle as two rivers rush in one \u2014 Deeper grows the channel, smoother all the happy waters run."], [26, "12 A LOVE RETROSPECT. Hush, my heart ; with all this lyric, lo ! as stately as the trees Conies the maiden, with a presence sweeter than a meadow breeze. \" Moon, that walkest like a queen through all the bowing stars above, Veil thine eyes, nor from thy heaven look upon a mortal's love. All the shadows round me brighten, earth grows sweet with sudden charms, As the maiden, like a goddess, sinks into my circling arms. 0, the clasp, and kiss, and bosom throbbing with its new delight ! \" Turn thy face, and let me, dearest, look into thine eyes to-night.

Slowly creeps her arm around me \u2014 slowly as a summer's dawn Slips along the dreamy hills, and all the night is half-withdrawn ; Happy stars look downward, wearing all their soft and holy looks, While the river keeps its murmur to the compass of a brook's. Trees wake up and whisper, \" Kingdoms are not worth a maiden's truth ;\" (This, I tell you, this was only in my unsuspicious youth). Then I shake apart the curls that clasp and nestle on her brow, Kiss its warmth, and whisper fondly in her ear a lover's vow \" Turn thine eyes to mine, and, sweetest, see as on some sacred shrine, All the best of my existence yearning to be knit to thine. Have I not a love within me, rolling like a boundless sea Bearing all my willing being, like a pilgrim, unto thee ?

Then I clasp the maiden closer, while her breath grows thick with sighs, And upon her eyelids slumbers light, as if from Paradise. \" Shall this bosom,\" thus I whisper, \" with its rich pulsations rife, Scatter music like a heaven through the stretches of my life ; Shall it keep its tone through all the trying change of good and ill, Pass beyond this life, and tremble with a finer rapture still ?\" Then I wait her answer, as in temples wrought with wealth and care, Hung the Greeks to hear the thunder of the gods that took their prayer. Slowly droops her eyelids downward, as through rich and glowing light, Drops a bird of sombre plumage in a long and steady flight ; Still she will not make reply, but, in the silence soft and meek, Lays a moment's gentle pressure of her lips against my cheek. 0 the bliss and warmth of lips that tremble with a maiden's truth (This, I tell you, this was only in my unsuspicious youth). Then I lift her forehead upward from its wavy wealth of hair, Look again into her eyes, and kiss the love that glimmers there. All the stars look downward, smiling, while the pulse of Nature seems Beating like the fairy murmurs heard in summer noonday dreams. Then again I question \u2014 \" Dearest, with thy very heart to mine, And thine arms en woven round me like twin branches of a vine \u2014 Who is he that through the pathways which thy glowing love hath wrought, Ranges, culling all the fancies of thine hours of sweetest thought .\" Droops her blushing forehead slowly downward that I may not see, As she whisper'd in a very heaven of murmurs, \" None but thee !\" 0 the power of love and madness ! 0 the pulse and strength of youth ! 0 the soul that melts like sunset in a maiden's eyes of truth ! Could I paint you then my feelings, fling the veil from off my soul, Show you all the dreams that shook me like a sudden thunder roll ; You would hold me but for jests, and twit me on the finer chords, Crying, with uplifted finger \u2014 \" Lo ! a fool of woman's words.\" \" Ay, a woman's words,\" I answer, \" they were pearls unto me, And my life shot from its darkness like a light from out the sea.

Then he who bore her to her heavenly rest Drew back the hand that hid her weeping eyes, And said, \" I cannot alter the request Of Him whose glory lights the earth and skies."], [31, "THE DEAD CHILD. 17 \" For ere I came, and, as I paused again, To hear His omnipresent words, He said, ' Take thou tbe root, but let the bud remain, To perfect into blossom in its stead.' \" And so I bear thee, that in our sweet land You may be one of our immortal kind, With not one task but to reach forth thy hand And guide the footsteps of thy child behind.\" He ceased, and winging, reach'd those realms on high. Whose lustre we half see through stars below, And all the light that fills our earthly sky Is but a shadow to its mighty glow. Now whether that the mother in this light Stood yearning for her treasure in our hands, Or whether God saw fitting in His might To reunite again the broken bands We know not ; but when night had come at last, And wore to clasp the first embrace of day, An angel enter'd, though the door was fast, And all unseen took what we held away. One took the mother from all earthly claim, From out the bounds of life and all its harms ; But still I think 'twas God Himself that came, And took the child and laid it in her arms.

And now the rite was o'er, and the sweet strife Of murmur'd words whose music made her wife, And guests had wish'd her happiness, and all That can of good to earthly beings fall, And he was at her side for whom her heart Had beat those vows that only could depart With death itself, if death could so untie Those links that seem for all eternity ; And she was happy, and around the room Her bright eyes wander'd, while a higher bloom Grew on her cheek, as still his manly tone Lived in her ear and mingled with her own.

He was firm as the granite, and wouldn't give in, Though he shook right before him a purse full of tin. No, no, He wouldn't go ; And he swore an oath he might change his skin If his conscience permitted the tempter to win. Now, St Patrick was fairly nonpluss'd, nor could tell What to do with this reptile, so cunning and fell ; At length, to his infinite joy and delight, He hit on a plan to put matters right ; So he got a box, And began to coax, As he open'd the lid with a confident air, Like a country packman displaying his ware, And, \" Look here,\" cried he, \" what a place to hold Your delicate form, and no fear of the cold ; Here you'll lie through the night-time as snug as paint ; And I pledge you my faith and my truth as a saint That as soon as the cock hails the morn with a shout I'll rise up with the lark and I'll let you out.\" But the serpent was sly, So he shut one eye, As he said, with a half-incredulous sigh, \" But really, St Patrick, the box is too small, And I don't think it ever would hold me at all ; Let me see it again. 0, no, I defy it.\" Said St Patrick blandly, \" Just you try it ; And if it won't do, Why, between us two, You can creep out again, and no harm will ensue.\" Now the serpent, to prove that St Patrick was wrong (And saints step aside, or there's no truth in song), Slipp'd into the box, slowly packing himself Neat as garments new folded and laid on a shelf, Till at last, when no more of his bulk could get in, A foot of his tail was left squirming without, So he cried, with a grin, \" Patrick, dear, do you doubt?\" But the Saint was his match, and \" Look out for your skin !\""], [101, "87 A LEGEND OF ST PATRICK. He thunder'd ; and down came tbe lid with a crash ; But his serpentship, seeing no end to tbe smash, Drew his tail in as quick as the lightning's flash, And was box'd at last, safe as miser's cash. Then St Patrick took up the box, and away He went to some lake or inland bay, Whose name the legend forgets to say ; There he flung it in, and it sank like the sword That Lancelot threw to save that of his lord.

So she pass'd into her home, and stood upon the shining hearth, Heaven's mission, like a balo, resting on her queenly head ; And her lips and eyes had parted with their dear old maiden's mirth For a staider look and gladness that were springing up instead. Happy now with him, her idol, like the cadence of a song, Swept the days above her, adding sweetness to her tender dream, Till at last, as comes the tempest, burst upon her head a wrong, Blighting all her life, as trees that shrink before the lightning's gleam.

Then he, half lifting up his earnest face, Paused for a little while, and then replied \u2014 \" Ada, whose beauty was a fairy thing, But brighter now by death, whose pencil tints His marks w.ith such sweet colours.\" Then he sunk Into that dreamy reverie which shuts All thought from out its vision, and so thinks, And thinks, and thinks, and yet thinks naught at all ; But I, half-answer'd, could but ill abide His silentness, and so I question'd still : \" But who is Ada ? you have never said, And there you dream, and think, and all the while The tolling of the bell within my ear, And yet I know not unto whom it offers Such sweet and stirless rest.\" Then starting up From all his fit of mute philosophy He said, \" Why, surely you have not forgot Ada, who flash' d upon you like a star Three months ago, when you were in the woods, At your old rambles, and she knew it not, But pass'd you in her beauty by, and you Fell half in love with her and writ a song ?\" Then all at once came, like remember'd dreams, The solitude around the woodland walk, And all the fringing of the idle rhyme (Now something better by the help of Death), Which I had made in haste, and sung to him A half-hour after. Now, what better time Than this, I cried, to sing that song again, When she is passing from all mortal view Into the shady quietness. And he, Catching the broader finish of the plan, Said, \" Let the song be sung, but make a pause Between each stanza, that the bell may chime Its echoes at the finish of each verse, And let your poet's fancy shape the words.\""], [166, "152 ADA, \u25a0j So, with the humming idyll of the brook As an accompaniment I sang the song : Ada came down by the path in the wood, In the flush and the warmth of the day, And the spirits that live in the solitude (For there be such they say) Came out from their haunts by tree and brook. And wherever sunbeams play, To gaze, as she pass'd like a bud on the lake \u2014 A sweet Diana of earthly make \u2014 In the clasp of the amorous day.

So the dust may shrink, but she Through the years, in the spheres, Is one great type of immortality. So sang the bell, and when its echo died I took my part in turn, and sang again : I was out in tbe wood when she pass'd me by, Half-bid that she could not see, So a woman's wish was in her eye, And a smile that made me, I know not why, Guess and dream that sbe Was far away in the golden hope Of the coming time, and the novel scope Of wifehood, and the prattling bliss Of little lips, and this, and this Was the light and colour within her eye, And the smile as she pass'd me by."], [167, "153 ADA.

Stars above and stars beneath me standing thus between their pow'r, Let my thoughts range into order and take colour from this hour.

Then the frets and fancies touching as with some magician's rod, Dreams within the fair to-morrow to the brightness of a god. Then the long melodious whisper filling every pause of time With its flowing out of passion and its bursts of golden rhyme. Then the grief for one fair being wither'd in the early bloom, With its yellow madness sneering at the purpose of a tomb. Shame on all that restless worship of the grand but aimless past, Let the stars pour down their wisdom that this night may be its last. Lo, from all their beams above me, from the shadows seen below, Love comes to me, slowly filling all my being with its glow. Love for Him that lit their lustre, love for human work and weal, Love for all the wider space in which the heart must move and feel. Then I bow as if my forehead felt the touch of spirit hands, Bow and feel my better nature growing as a bud expands ; Then the silence all around me whispers with a fruitful sound \u2014 Let the faith this night hath given keep thee ever in its bound.

It is sweet to think this world, with its toil, and rush, and jar, Cannot take this being from us, or have power to shake or mar.
