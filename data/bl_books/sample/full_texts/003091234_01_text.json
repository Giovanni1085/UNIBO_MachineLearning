We'll answer all the charges he has made, And toss dishonour from us like a rag Which nobody will own. We may some day Have treaties to conclude with some of you. You would not feel it courteous should we ask Your right to treat with us. So 'twas with Tancred; We found him king, and as a king we met him.

So much for France. Now for the coward slander sneering murder. We could explain it but our pride revolts. We stand here a proud man who could not stoop to't. Last comes the great, the lurid, glaring sin. It is a brightness we are proud to wear. We'll not disown it. When our tired allies, All weak in purpose and in earnestness, Had fall'n away \u2014 with a stern English remnant We wrenched from great Saladin such conditions As France with twenty armies ne'er had won.
