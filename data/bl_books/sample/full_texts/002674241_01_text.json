IN venturing to introduce to the public his \" Popular History of Exeter,\" the author has been actuated by a desire to meet a want which, he believes, has been long felt. Although more than one useful and cleverly-compiled history of the old City exists (Dr. Oliver's in particular), yet the high prices at which they are published, coupled with the not too \"popular\" style of their publication, have combined, as a London journal* has observed, \"to keep them out of the hands of those who would otherwise have found for them a place on their shelves.\" The author does not claim to himself any other merit than that of having endeavoured, in a humble way, to help popularise the history of his native City ; and if he has been in any degree successful in this direction, he will be well repaid for the time he has devoted to the task. The modern portion of the book will be recognised as containing much that is supplementary to our existing local histories. In conclusion, the author would point out that he makes no apologies for thrusting this little work upon the public, seeling sure that they will believe him when he says that a love for old \" Semper Fidelis,\" and a desire to make more of its inhabitants acquainted with its highly interesting history, are the only motives which have induced him to trouble them with the publication. 61, Bath Road, Exeter, November, 1885. * The Literary World."], [14, ""], [15, "CONTENTS.

We need not remind our readers that most of our ancient cities and towns were enclosed with walls and gates, necessary for defence in \" troublous times;\" but, as we have indicated in preceding parts of the work, modern conveniences required, in Exeter, the removal of these barriers. The first of the gates to disappear was North Gate, demolished in 1769; East Gate in 1784; West Gate in 1815; and South Gate in 1819. The Mint. The archway and adjoining buildings shewn in our illustration were portions of the ancient Prior)' of St. Nicholas. The archway, and the structures over, were removed about 20 years ago, for the purpose of improving the thoroughfare. This street has always borne the title of \" the Mint.\" There, in all probability, coinage was carried on in ancient times. Old Grammar School Premises, 1852. The old Norman arches and columns shewn in our illustration, carry us back to early monastic foundations. Here in the beginning of the 13th century, two brothers, Gilbert and John Long, founded the Hospital of St. John for poor men and women. Allusion is made further on to the ancient High School in Musgrave's Alley, which, it would appear, after a lapse of time was attached to an early institution of the kind at St. John's Hospital. In the 17th century \u2014 we quote from an interesting account of the Hospital by the head master of the new grammar school (Dr. Carlos) \u2014 \" Hugh Crossing, twice mayor of Exeter, in 1609 and 1620, had resolved to reinstate the old school and hospital. When he died intestate, his widow, Joan Crossing (all honour to their names! good wife and good citizen!), honoured her husband's memory by carrying out his wishes ; she handed over to certain feoffers ' all the house scite, circuite, and precinct of the late dissolved hospital or house of The lithographic illustrations have been especially executed for this history by Mr. George Townsend, of Exeter, the well-known Antiquarian Artist.

Wright, f.r.h.s., the esteemed editor of the Western Antiquary."], [20, "VI OUR ILLUSTRATIONS. St. John's.' \" Thus, once again, the site and buildings returned to public and educational purposes. As most of our readers are aware, all the St. John's buildings, chapel, etc., fronting the High Street were swept away, and the entire establish ment removed to new buildings in St. Leonards (see page 169). Old Exe Bridge. The first bridge over the Exe was erected about the middle of the 13th century, through the instrumentality and munificence of Walter Gervis, a wealthy merchant, who four times filled the civic chair. On this bridge a chauntry and a church had been erected \u2014 the latter being the parochial church of St. Edmund, whose tower is shewn in our illustration. Houses occupied both sides of what is now known as Old Bridge Street ; those shown in the sketch were pulled down about the year 1881. The buildings on the opposite side were removed in 1848. Exeter Sword-Bearer. On pages 68 and 69, the origin of this office will be found recorded. The first sword-bearer was Francis Gilbert, who was elected on 25th July, I498 ; and the last was Mr. Hugh Cumming, who on the 25th of May, 1836, ceased to perform the duties of the office on his appointment as Superintendent of Police. No sword-bearer was appointed in his place; but the weapon has since been borne before the Mayor on public occasions, and the Cap of Maintenance worn, by the senior sergeant at mace. Our portrait is that of Mace-Sergeant Fouracre, who died a year or two since ; the present holder of the office is James Skinner (senior mace sergeant). The other mace sergeants are William James Wreford, and William Shipcott ; and the Mayor's sergeant, Thomas Meardon. The head-gear of the Mayor and his officers has, since the appoint ment of Mr. Daw, been the subject of much controversy. On the suggestion of the Somerset Herald (Mr. Tucker), the Georgian hats usually worn were discarded in the favour of a chapeau of the Tudor period, as being the more correct thing. The introduction of the latter, however (chiefly on account of its gaudy appearance), was unfavourably received, and, it being left to the Mayor to please himself whether he wore the Tudor or Georgian hat, he publicly, at a council meeting held early in January, expressed his preference for the latter. Liverydole. These almshouses, says Izacke in his Memorials of Exeter, \" were erected for 12 aged men to inhabit, there being allotted to each of them"], [21, "OUR ILLUSTRATIONS. VII a low room and a chamber over the same, and a little plot of ground for a garden, all enclosed with a wall, and twelve pence weekly for their maintenance, and a hundred faggots yearly for ever ; and there was a decent chapel within the house and a chaplain to read prayers daily therein unto them.\" This arrangement of the houses and residents was revised by the Charity Commissioners in 1823, whereby poor men and women were provided for. The administration of the charity appears to have been under the management of the Rolle* family, as descendants of Sir Thos. Dennis, the founder. The almshouses, having become very dilapidated, were rebuilt in 1S50. In clearing away the old buildings, a portion of the stake (with the iron ring attached) at which Benet was burnt was dug up. This relic was removed to Bicton. Liverydole chapel, dedicated to St. Clarus early in the 15th century, was probably a chantry supported principally by doles or alms, where prayers were offered for the souls of criminals executed. Liverydole appears to have been the place of public execution, until after the burning of Benet, the martyr, about 1530, when the execution place was removed to Ringswell, beyond Heavitree Bridge. Prince says, concerning the martyrdom of Benet, under the direction of Sir Thomas Dennis, the sheriff of Devon at that time, \" whether out of a principle of charity at large, or touched with the atrocity of the past (he having been so nearly concerned in it), as is most probable, in this place he founded and erected an almshouse for 12 aged men to inhabit.\" Old Chapel, Musgrave's Alley. In the general body of our work, an account of the Wesleyan occupation of this chapel will be found. It was the High School of Exeter, founded and built a.d. 1343, by Richard de Braylegh, Dean of Exeter. The building, which possessed a history of peculiar interest to the arch\u00e6ological student, was transformed into an Emporium of Fashion by Messrs. J. T. Tucker & Sons, in 1876-7; and in excavating for the foundations of the new buildings, many objects of interest were dis covered, such as Roman pottery, coins, and local trade tokens. A copper coin of Constantine was found in good preservation at 12 feet below the surface. Old House, Cathedral Yard.

In the Cathedral Yard, there are several interesting specimens \u2014 one of these is shewn in our illustrations, the shop being occupied by Mr. C. Elkin Mathews, Old and New Bookseller. Water Seller. The year 1832, the calamitous \" Cholera morbus \" year saw a great impetus given to various schemes of sanitary improvement, among them, that of providing a sufficient supply of water for sanitary and domestic purposes. Dr. Shapter, in his History of the Cholera in 1832, thus refers to the water supply : \" We have seen displayed a large and dense population deriving this necessary and great luxury of life in the smallest quantities, and chiefly from the most difficult source; the occasional wells and conduits of old times, and the scanty bucketful ofthe water carriers; the mains of the ancient waterworks laid but in few parts of the City, ancl even then, but scantily applied to ; the streets unwatered, save a portion of the High Street, and that only by private subscription of the inhabitants.\" Our illustration shews the ordinary supply of river water by sale from house to house, from a hogshead of water, dipped from the stream, and sold out at the rate of about three buckets for a penny. Mr. Cossins, in his Reminiscences of Exeter, says of this mode of supplying water, that twenty or thirty water-carts drawn by horses and donkeys were occupied daily in distributing it. Confectionery Standing. Before the extension of the railway system, periodical fairs were the principal sources of popular recreation, as well as of ordinary business. Previous to the erection of covered markets, fairs and markets were generally held in the open streets. This was the case in Exeter, as we have already stated. Our illustration shews one of the \" comfit \" or confectionery booths, a last remnant of an old usage, when, at \" fair time \" the main street of Exeter would be occupied by numerous temporary erections of this kind for trade and other purposes, while the pleasure portion, with its \"shows\" and amusements of different descriptions, were planted on the upper part of Southernhay, then a kind of open common, and used for this purpose. New Building, Exeter. In contrast to our sketch of the old house in Cathedral Yard, we have fronting page 163, a view of one of those many magnificent buildings which the main streets of Exeter can boast in the present time.

IX well-known West of England Jewellers and Gold and Silversmiths, of High Street and Bedford Street. The Bedford Street improvement, was, in itself, a boon to the City ; but it was incomplete until the erection of the splendid building referred to, and those adjoining (the Constitutional Club, etc.). Post Office. Andrew Brice, in his Topographical Dictionary, says that there was a Post Office in the Cathedral Yard, somewhere between Broadgate and St. Martin's Lane. About 1805-6, or thereabouts, the Post Office was in a house attached to the south angle of the west front of the Cathedral. For a short time it was removed to Gandy Street, thence to the upper part of the Yard, in the house now occupied by Mrs. Treadwin. Its next removal was to the spot shewn in our illustration. It afterwards occupied in succession two positions in Queen Street, and has now been removed to the handsome and commodious new buildings at the top of High Street. The City Prison. This building was erected in 1818-9 to accommodate criminals and debtors, who formerly occupied old South Gate, destroyed in 1819. The subject of our illustration was also doomed to give place to the County Gaol, where the prisoners were transferred in 1863. Mr. Gully was governor of the South Gate Prison, and at its demolition was appointed governor of the new prison, until his death in 1830, when his son, Mr. J. G. Gully, was appointed. The latter held the office of governor until the removal of the prisoners to the County Gaol. Captain Cooke. John Cooke, Saddler of Exeter, whose business premises was that now occupied by Mr. Dameral, Saddler and Harness Maker, High Street, was for 50 years the leader of the High Sheriff of Devon's troop of javelin men, hence his title of \"Captain.\" He was first appointed in 1790 by the High Sheriff of Devon, Mr. Peter Perrin. He died about the year 1841, aged 76 years. Cooke was a well-known public character in his time, was author of a curious pamphlet, entitled Old England for Ever, and supplied public information of various kinds, previous to the existence of cheap postage and cheap newspapers. A journalistic notice of him runs thus: \" Mr. Cooke had considerable originality, both of mind and feature; and those who have seen him at the head of the Sheriff's cortege will not soon forget him. In the Assize"], [24, "X OUR ILLUSTRATIONS. Court on those occasions he played a conspicuous part. When the list of Grand Jurymen was being called, Captain Cooke, in his official costume, half a century old, with his rapier and sash, his venerable cocked hat and rusty spear, as he stood in the witness-box enforcing the rules and orders of the Court, with all the energy of a veteran disciplinarian, seemed a greater man, for the time, than the judge himself.\" Mr. William Brown, J.P. This gentleman, to whom the Popular History of Exeter is dedicated, was the third son of the holder of Moorhead Farm, Creetown (Scotland). He was born on 22nd February, 1827, coming of a worthy stock. Receiving his education in Creetown, he came to Exeter in 1844, and here carried on the business of a draper. By perseverance and industry, Mr. Brown rose to a high social position in the City \u2014 represented the Town Council in St. Sidwell's Ward for 10 years ; served in the Board of Guardians, and was elected Mayor in 1884 (November). In the latter capacity he was exceedingly popular, and when a change in the political status of the Council in November, 1885 (Mr. Brown was a Liberal) necessitated his retirement, the subject of our sketch left the civic chair amid general expressions of regret, and it was acknowledged that he had well filled the post. During Mr. Brown's mayoralty, that gentle man bade God-speed to Dr. Temple, welcomed his successor, Bishop Bickersteth ; and also saw Mr. Bucknill succeed Sir Arthur Collings in the Recordership. During his term of office, the funds of the Museum were benefitted to the extent of about Mr. R. R. M. Daw, an exceedingly popular gentleman, succeeds Mr. Brown. Entrance to Goldsmith Street, High Street. The old house shewn, which nearly blocked out the Church of Allhallows, Goldsmith Street, was removed in 1879. It possessed an interest connected with one of its inhabitants, namely, that of the late Sir Matthew Wood, who was Knighted by Her Majesty the Queen (her first act of the kind), and was twice Lord Mayor of London, and sat as M.P. for the City in nine successive parliaments. Wood, when a lad, was apprenticed to his cousin, Mr. Newton, a Druggist, who occupied the old house. After serving his apprenticeship, he went to London and amassed a fortune in business, and eventually became possessor of a large proportion of the wealth accumulated by the eccentric \"Jemmy Wood,\" the banker of Gloucester."], [25, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER.

Prob ably, many of the scenes would be of a nature calculated to shock and disgust the nineteenth century mind ; but to behold ancient Britain \u2014 to see old Exeter \u2014 in those times to which the greatest hero of research has failed to penetrate, doubtless would be to witness a scene sublime in its savage grandeur. A"], [26, "2 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. The man has yet to be born who will give us any thing like a thoroughly satisfactory account of Exeter in its very infancy, and until the local world of history is agitated with delight at the advent of this being of surpassing genius we must be content to do our work in this matter with such materials as are, fortunately, already at our disposal. We might dwell with feelings of pleasure upon the pretty and romantic traditions which are extant con cerning Exeter in its earliest days, but duty constrains us to tear ourselves away from the seductive charms of legendary lore. Having done this, we will follow those guides who, by their learning and assiduity, are worthy of all the confidence we can give them ; and proceed, as well as we can, to drag dear old Exeter out of the regions of mystery and darkness. Very early in the world's history, our Bible tells us, God determined, in consequence of the great wickedness which prevailed, to destroy the earth with a deluge. By Divine command, however, Noah built an ark, in which he and his family found refuge from the flood. According to chronological computation, on Wednesday, May 6th, 2348 years before Christ, the waters having assuaged, the ark rested upon Mount Ararat. On Fri day, December 8th, Noah was enabled to leave his place of asylum, and subsequently his numerous families dispersed to all quarters of the earth, the western part not stopping in their progress until some had penetrated the country of Britain.* Europe was allotted to Japheth * \" So says Theophilus of Antioch.\" \u2014 Camden."], [27, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 3 and his posterity ; and it is said that his eldest son gave birth and likewise name to the Gomerians, afterwards known as the Cimbri, and it is supposed that from these Gomeri (who lived in Gaul) the Britain s derived their origin.* There was, however, dwelling in another portion of Gaul, a people known as the Belg\u00e6, + a powerful nation, and one whom C\u00e6sar found no little difficulty in reducing to subjection. Britain was always an attractive country to adventurers of the olden times, and the Belg\u00e6, drawn to these shores by a love of warfare and plunder, landed in bodies on the south coast, and in the course of time penetrated into Devon shire. At this period, the Cimbri (we learn from various authorities) occupied Devonshire and the Cornabii dwelt in Cornwall ; and from what can be gathered from historians and the remains of fortifications and defences in Devonshire, the ancient inhabitants of that county struggled hardly against their invaders. The Belg\u00e6 (the arguments of Whittaker and others go to show) succeeded in conquering the Cimbri and Cornabii and usurping their dominions, driving the former into the north-west of Devonshire and occupying the possessions of the latter in the south eastern part of the county. The people who thus usurped the land of the primi tive inhabitants of Devonshire were known afterwards * Camden. t In the beginning of his Commentaries C\u00e6sar describes the Belg\u00e6."], [28, "4 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. as the Danmonii,* who are described as a \" most powerful people.\" They had several cities, but the chief was Caerisk (or Cairwich), a word which signifies \" the city of waters. \"t And it is at this point that we may entertain a hope of emerging from the cloud of obscurity and doubt which has enveloped us in our progress from \"the earliest times,\" for Caerisk \u2014 the chief city of this powerful people \u2014 was Exeter itself, and the river on which it stood was the Exe. It is not beyond the bounds of reason to imagine that Exeter was a place of great importance long be fore this period ; but, whether it was so or not, there can be but little doubt of its value and eminence from the time that it became the chief city of the Danmonii. A little careful consideration of the subject can bring us to no other conclusion ; for we have a right to assume that the many advantages which such a site possessed \u2014 its commanding elevation, its beautiful sur roundings, its atmospheric salubrity, and the fruitful character of the adjacent country \u2014 were reasons why these ancient people should have made it a place of settlement, and have found it one of an important character. | This they undoubtedly did, for, in addition to the advantages already referred to, the city was in the vicinity of the tin district of Devonshire, the wealth of * Whittaker. t Pen- Caer, the head or chief city ; Caer-ruth, the city on the red soil ; and other British names have also been assigned to Exeter. % Dr. Oliver."], [29, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 5 which attracted the Ph\u0153nicians (probably the Greeks) and people of other ancient nations. We should find it interesting to pursue further this branch of history, to learn the manner in which these enterprising people found their way to our shores; to read the story of a Ph\u0153nician stranding his ship rather than betray to the occupants of a Roman vessel the object of his search ; to consider the extent of their commerce in the western world ; and to peruse interest ing accounts of merchants whose fame has been even published in Holy Writ. But our space is limited, and we must pass on, only pausing to remember the fact that the trading of these people with Devonshire and Cornwall is attested by reliable witnesses,* and that, in addition, the)' have left behind them many traces of their visits in the shape of names of places which are of Ph\u0153nician derivation. Those people were, too, ingenious manufacturers, were skilled in architecture, and worked cleverly in jewellery, timber, stones, metal, etc. There is a probability, therefore, that much of this skill was transmitted by them to the inhabitants of the parts which they visited, and that the people of ancient Exeter reaped much benefit therefrom. * Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Salinus attest the arrival of the Ph\u0153nicians to the Scilly Islands and their trade in tin (according to Sammes)."], [30, "6 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. CHAPTER II. Exeter during the Roman Invasion \u2014 Its Importance \u2014 Evidences of Roman Occupation \u2014 Ptolemy's Geography \u2014 The supposed Siege by Vespasian. ' W-f AVING gone so far in our last chapter, it is t ft f not hard to imagine that the Romans in the course of their penetrations into Britain came as far as Exeter, and, being a far-seeing people, and recognising the many advantages which the site of the city possessed, made a settlement of some sort here, taking steps to fortify the place and to otherwise deal with it for the service of their own ends. It is true that historians make but little mention of Exeter at this early period, but the fact that it was situated in a remote part of the country, removed from the scenes of strife which so much convulsed the land at this date will easily account for the historical silence.* There is abundant evidence that the Romans did not neglect Devonshire, nor fail to set a proper value upon it, and there are not wanting proofs that Exeter was adopted by them as an im portant station. The Romans, according to Antonius, changed the ancient name of Exeter, (C\u00e6risk,) into Isca, and the * Bede."], [31, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 7 river upon which it stood then bore the same name. There is the authority of the well-known local historian, Dr. Oliver, for stating that a Roman encampment was formed in the very heart of the city, and that tessel- ated pavements have been discovered at the top of South Street, as well as in the enclosure on the north side of the Cathedral. Roman coins, ancient pottery, and sepulchral urns have also been found by digging in different parts of Exeter, and rather early in the present century a colossal head of the Empress Julia Donna, and an ancient brass lamp, were unearthed whilst excavating for the foundation of a house at the upper end of Musgrave's Alley, High Street.* It is supposed that the latter belonged to a temple of Diana, and it is therefore conjectured that a temple dedicated to that goddess once stood near the spot. Baths have been discovered in the Higher Market in Queen Street, and traces of a Roman summer camp have been found on Stoke Hill (near the site of Marypole Head reservoir), just outside the city. Further than all this, there is evidence that ancient roads meet in Exeter as a central situation, the city being on the great Roman, or mili- tary road, and it is the last station in the west mentioned in the Itinerary of Antonius (who travelled through Britain, a.d. 140). It is there referred to as Isca Dumnunniorum. Ptolemy, in his geography, gives the second Roman legion (the August) as being stationed at Exeter, but as there is proof that the head-quarters of the Legio secunda Augusta (for the greater part of the time it * Jenkins's History of Exeter."], [32, "8 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. was in Britain) were at Isca Silurum, or C\u00e6rleon (the city of the Legion) in Monmouthshire, the geographer appears to be in error. At any rate, if the legion was placed at all at Exeter, it could not have been its principal station. Grasping at likely stories as they float by on the stream of uncertainty in which we are struggling, we take hold of the statement of the Chroni con of the Church of Exeter, which asserts that Ves pasian, the Roman General, laid siege to Exeter (in the year 49 of the Christian \u00e6ra) for eight days, at the end of which period it was released by King Arviragus; but as this statement is open to some doubt, we must not place too much reliance upon it. Some people, with the name of Julius C\u00e6sar ever lastingly on their tongue, imagine that that personage built the castle of Exeter, but that is an illusion which C\u00e6sar's short stay in the island, and the improbability of his having ever come to Devonshire soon dispels. It is not unlikely, however, that Rougemont Castle occu pies the site of the Roman pr\u00e6torium or garrison, and no doubt the walls of the city are upon the Roman founda tions. One of the arches of the old south gate appeared to be Roman, and a little old house in St. Paul's, known as King Athelstan's palace, was believed to have been of Roman origin.* Having traversed thus far, the difficulty of the task we have undertaken will be realised, but, everything taken into account, we may safely close this chapter by answering, in the affirmative, the often put query \u2014 Was Exeter ever a Roman settlement of importance ? * Dr. Stukeley's account of his visit to this city in the beginning of the last century."], [33, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 9 CHAPTER III.

The danger which threatened Rome itself now engrossed the attention of Britain's conquerors : the Roman forces were withdrawn and Britain was left to its own resources. Encouraged by the defenceless condition of the country, the old enemies of the Britons, the Picts and Scots, once more commenced their inroads and ravages. In vain did the persecuted people appeal for protection to their former masters, and driven to despair they determined to seek aid elsewhere. A council was formed, with Vortigern, Prince of the Danmonii (a man whose vices did not seem to lessen the people's estimation of his value), at the head of affairs. At their invitation a body of Saxons, headed by two buccaneers, Hengist and Horsa, came to the aid of the Britons. True to their com pact, they set to work and drove the northern invaders"], [34, "10 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. back to their own domains ; but, finding the weakness of their employers, they resolved to conquer Britain for themselves. Victory after victory rewarded them, and encouraged by their success they invited over the Jutes and Angles (their countrymen) to share in the good fortune which had been theirs. Thus reinforced they went on vigorously with their work of conquest, with the result that within a century and a half the whole country, with the exception of Wales and the tract of land extending from Land's End to the Exe, and half of Exeter itself, became subject to Saxon rule.* The Cornish Britons, as the inhabitants of Devon and Cornwall were known, fought desperately against the invaders, and it is not until the year 633 a.d. that anything of very great importance concerning Exeter itself occurred. About this date, according to Matthew of Westminster, Penda, the king of Mercia, laid siege to Exeter. Ill would it have fared with the inhabitants had they fallen a prey to Penda's ferocity and power. Fortunately for them, Penda was suddenly attacked by Cadwalinus, king of the Britons, who, however, liber ated him on his entering into a treaty (offensive and defensive). But it was destined that Exeter, like the rest of the country, should fall under Saxon domination. Egbert, king of Wessex (who aspired to and afterwards attained the supremacy of the country), about 800 a.d. made an attack on the Cornish Britons. The latter fought des perately for that dear possession, their independence, repeated defeats failing to discourage them. Fourteen * Dr. Oliver, quoting from Dr. Lingard's History of England."], [35, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 11 years of warfare, however, had the result of subduing their spirit, and they submitted to Egbert: the condi tions of submission being that they should enjoy their own laws and pay an annual tribute. At this period, then, Exeter (which was included in the treaty) fell under Saxon rule.* The British in habitants of the city were permitted, as agreed, to enjoy their lands, but the Saxons were now allowed to live with them. There is little or no reason to doubt that the know ledge of the Christian faith which was introduced into this country from Rome in the earliest times was extended to Exeter. Evidence of the city having had a monastery before the end of the 7th century is to be gathered from the life of St. Wilfrid, or Boniface. To the monastery in Exeter, Boniface was sent to be educated at an early age, the place of his learning being then governed by the Abbot Wolphard.t Boni face was consecrated on the 30th November, 723, by Pope Gregory XI. He was subsequently raised to the archbishopric of Mentz, and to the present day is supposed to have been the apostle of Germany. A short, but interesting, story shall conclude this chapter. About the year 740 (in the time of Boniface), Sidwella, one of the devout daughters of Benna, a noble Briton, lived in or near Exeter. It is said that at Benna's death, the heartless step-mother of Sidwella became covetous of the latter's fortune (which was * Jenkins's History of Exeter. t Bishop Grandisson's Legenda Sanctorum."], [36, "12 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. extensive in the eastern suburbs of the city). Accord ingly, she employed a servant to put an end to the young woman's life, and one day whilst Sidwella was engaged at devout exercises at a well, where she led the life of a recluse, the bribed murderer struck off her head with an instrument believed to be a reaping hook. St. Sidwell's church was afterwards dedicated to the vic tim's memory, and near that sacred edifice is the site of a well which is supposed to be the one at which the foul murder was committed. The tomb containing Sidwella's remains was believed to be in the church raised to her memory.* * Dr Oliver."], [37, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 13 CHAPTER IV.

But the country, which the Saxons originally pos- sessed themselves of in so dishonourable a manner, was not destined to remain long at peace. Another scourge in the shape of ruthless foreign invaders was hovering in its vicinity. About the year 787, the Nor wegian and Danish pirates had commenced their inroads upon this country ; and having subsequently entered into an alliance with the Britons in Cornwall, they came with a fleet to that county a.d. 835, and made advances into Devonshire. The valiant Egbert, however, at the head of an army, fell in with the invaders at Hengstone Hill, and inflicted on them a total defeat. But despite reverses and the making of solemn com pacts, the Danes continued to overrun the country, barbarity, ruin, and desolation marking their progress through the land. In the year 875 (in the reign of the good King Alfred), they, after having suddenly attacked the British army, marched upon Exeter and surprised it. Here a portion of them took up their winter quarters, and during their stay damaged the city and"], [38, "14 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. acted towards the inhabitants with characteristic cruelty. The Danes in Exeter at this time were joined by a party of fellow freebooters (cavalry) from Ware ham, in Dorset, and Dr. Oliver thinks that it was during the sojourn of these marauders in the city that the monastery was sacked and destroyed. It requires not a very flexible fancy to imagine the dismay which overwhelmed the poor citizens when the enemy was in their midst. But succour was at hand. Tempests had cast 120 ships of the Danish fleet upon the English coasts, and Alfred meeting their army marching towards Exeter, totally defeated it. Now was the time for retaliation on the part of the citizens. The Danish occupants of Exeter, having heard of the reverses which had attended their com rades, and having received intelligence of Alfred's advance, fled from the city, but not before many of them had suffered just vengeance at the hands of the people whom they had persecuted. Many of those who escaped the city's wrath fled to Dartmouth, but numbers of them perished in a terrific storm. The rest re treated to Chippenham, where, their numbers being augmented, they attacked and reduced the English to great distress, once more bringing desolation and terror in their train, and robbing Alfred of all his kingdom except Somerset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire; and Exeter, among other fortified places. In the year 894, the Danes came before the city and laid siege to it again. The inhabitants resolutely defended themselves, their determination being strength ened both by a fear of the results of a surrender to"], [39, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 15 such a cruel foe, and by the courage which a promise of immediate succour from Alfred inspired in them. The brave monarch was not long following his messengers of hope. The Danes, hearing of his approach, raised the siege and fled, escaping to their ships before Alfred and his troops could overtake them. Several of their vessels were, however, afterwards captured by the English fleet, and the crews put to death as pirates. For a time the blessing of comparative peace pre vailed in the country, and during this happy interval Alfred set to work to repair the damage which the Danes had committed in our city. Mathew of West minster assures us that he fortified Exeter with new bulwarks, and \" greatly beautified it.\" In the year 918, Edward the Elder came to Exeter, and here held a Wiltena-gemote, or general assembly of his chief subjects in the city ; and seven years later Athelstan, to whom, says Dr. Oliver, \" Exeter must ever look up as her special benefactor,\" succeeded to the kingship. During his reign the Britons in Exeter (and the west of Devonshire generally) rebelled ; but on Athelstan having information of this he marched west ward, drove the rebels from the city (out of Devonshire, in fact,) and fixed the River Tamar as the boundary of the Cornish Britons. Up to this period the fortifications of the city con sisted of \" huge bulwarks of earth, strengthened by stakes, and surrounded by ditches.\" These Athelstan, on his return to Exeter, destroyed, and built round the city a stone wall of a mile-and-a-half in circuit, flanked"], [40, "16 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. by towers, a deep and regular fosse encompassing the whole. A great portion of this wall still stands, and decaying remains of the ancient battlements are yet to be seen. Amongst other beneficent and important works for the city, Athelstan built a castle (of which more in a later chapter), re-founded her minster, or monastery, dedicated to SS. Mary and Peter, and gave it the privilegeof a double mint. During one of the visits with which he frequently honoured the city, he held a Wittena-gemote, or parliament, at which was enacted a body of laws (to be seen in Brompton's Chronicle) for the protection of property, the due administration of justice, and for the punishment of offenders. According to Izaacke and Hoker, Athelstan changed the name of the city to Exanc\u00e6ster (or Exeter) from Moncton, which the Saxons had derisively called it ever since the year 450, in consequence of the number of monks who dwelt here. The learned Dr. Oliver thinks this assertion a strange one, and says : \u2014 \" The charter to which they refer, if it be genuine (its date, 670, is manifestly inaccurate, and the names of the witnesses belonged to an antecedent period) can bear no such construction. For the king professes to grant to the Monastery of St. Mary and St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles, at Exanc\u00e6ster, a manse called Munecatum; and then are distinctly specified the boundaries of this manse in the Saxon language. We believe the property lay along the Sut Brook, which rises in the south-east part of St. Sidwell's parish, and is fed by several springs and wells ; but is now in great measure covered over in Newtown, passes along the bottom of Paris Street and Holloway, and empties itself into the Exe below the quay.\" Edgar, on entering the matrimonial bonds for the third time, took to wife Elfrida, daughter of Ordgar,"], [41, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 17 Earl of Devon, who was buried in this city in 971, and of whom this queer story is told.

His utter inability to perform the important duties of his position, his cowardice and general imbecility, were an inducement for the Danes to once more commence their ravages; and events which ensued were of a calamitous order. In the year 1001, a Danish force, under the command of Sweyn, King of Denmark, appeared off Exmouth, and soon the terrible news was borne to Exeter that the invaders were on their way to attack the city. The inhabitants made such preparation for defence as the time would allow, determined to offer a stout resist ance; and when Sweyn and his army arrived outside the city they found that the taking of it was not so easy a matter as they had calculated upon. The marauders made a furious attack on the place, but the"], [43, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 19 resistance of the citizens, and the strength of the forti fications, made the efforts of Sweyn and his company ineffectual. For nearly two months the siege continued, and, as might be imagined, the people of Exeter were reduced to great distress. However, aid was at hand, and this was a fortunate circumstance, for the results of a sur render would have been appalling. Under the command of the generals Cola and Eadsig, the forces of Devon, Somerset, and Dorset collected, and in coming to the relief of the city, they engaged the Danes in battle at their camp at Pinhoe, near Exeter. The fight was a desperate one, but the enemy prevailed. They seemed, however, to have given over the project of taking the city, for the following morning Sweyn re-embarked his troops at Exmouth, having on his way back to that place set Pinhoe, Broadclyst, and other villages, in flames.* In order to do something towards protecting the country from the Danes, Ethelred fitted out a fleet, which he placed under the command of Edric, Duke of Mercia ; but the latter, with a part of the fleet, went over to the enemy. The remainder, it is recorded, were compelled to take refuge in the river Exe (\"within in the walls of Excester\"t), which circumstance, if true, favours the assumption that, in ancient times, the tide flowed beyond the city. * The Saxon Chronicle. t William of Malmesbury,"], [44, "20 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. In the following year, 1002, a fearful tragedy was enacted. The Danes, throughout the kingdom, were slaughtered to satisfy a fearsome whim of Ethelred, and among the victims was Gunhelda, the sister of Sweyn. In the year succeeding the massacre, that monarch crossed to England, his mission being to avenge the murders of his sister and his countrymen. His advance on Exeter, and the knowledge of the fate which awaited the inhabitants in the case of Sweyn and his forces obtaining an entrance to the place in any way, induced the alarmed citizens to look to their defences. This time, too, their courageous resistance might have been the means of their salva tion, but they did not reckon on having a traitor in their midst. On the 19th of August, 1003, the governor of the city \u2014 Hugh, a Norman, who had to thank Queen Emma for his position \u2014 let the enemy into the cit)- ; and the scene which followed was fearful in all its details. The vengeance which the Danes came to award they dealt out relentlessly. Flames leaping from churches and dwellings ; the shrieks and groans of victims of the cold blooded enemy; the fall of the monuments of art ; the demolition of the fortifications \u2014 all these soon told of how thoroughly Sweyn was carrying into effect his threats of vengeance. In a short space of time the city was reduced to ashes; but the man who was mainly responsible for bringing about this sad condition of affairs \u2014 Hugh, the governor \u2014 did not escape scot-free, for he was dragged off in chains by the enemy, whom he thought, no doubt,"], [45, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 21 would treat him liberally for his act of treachery towards the city under his charge. On the death of Sweyn, Canute, his son, succeeded him, and the latter sought in some measure to atone for the cruelty committed by his father, by acts of conciliation and liberality. As a consequence of Canute's demeanour towards his subjects, people took courage to return to their former habitations, and on the site of demolished Exeter a city once more arose. By the assistance of Canute the fortifications were rebuilt, and churches and other buildings again appeared within the walls. A royal charter, granted to Abbot Akelwoldus, re-established the former rights and privileges in con nection with the monastery of St. Mary and All Saints; and to the church of St. Peter was given the manor of Stoke, near Exeter. To a city which has passed through so many phases of trouble as Exeter, this liberal behaviour must have been recognised as a blessing ; and we need not wonder at the people holding the monarch in some amount of veneration. A commemoration of the illustrious monarch in Stoke Canon church took the form of a representation (painted on glass) of a king engaged in prayer, it being surmounted by the inscription \" Rex Canutus.\" In the person of Edward the Confessor the Saxon line was restored, and in the reign of this illustrious monarch Exeter was destined to flourish. The popula tion of the city grew in numbers, its trade was in a healthy and prosperous condition, and a happier state of things than, probably, had ever been experienced before, at that time prevailed. To add to Exeter's"], [46, "22 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. importance, the united sees of Devon and Cornwall were removed by Edward (with the concurrence of Pope Leo IX*) from Crediton to Exeter, Leofric, who had some rather short time before been nominated to the See of Crediton, thus becoming the first Bishop of Exeter. The ceremony of installation was elaborate and grand, Leofric being conducted to the episcopal chair with King Edward supporting his right arm and Queen Editha the left. During Edward's reign the city continued to prosper, religion progressed with satis factory strides, and when the monarch left this world, amid a universal hope and belief that he had ex changed it for a better, the citizens sincerely regretted the loss of the king who had so much befriended them. Exeter possessed municipal government during the Saxon period, in virtue of its existence as an Anglo- Saxon burgh ; and, according to Domesday, its inhabit ants had lands outside the city amounting to twelve carucates, which, except to the city itself, paid no custom. The same privileges were enjoyed by Exeter as by London, York, and Winchester. The duty of its chief officer, the Wic-reeve or Provost, was to collect the king's revenue. His was a crown appointment, and he exercised the same authority in the city as did the sheriff in the county. Dr. Oliver."], [47, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 23 CHAPTER VI.

And such was the case ; for it had been resolved that, whatever other places had done, Exeter should not yield to the haughty will of the Conqueror. A storm had driven a band of William's mercenaries into the Exe ; and this fact, coupled with the incite ment of Githa (mother of Harold), who was a refugee in the city, made the people more determined in their action. A siege was looked upon as being inevitable,"], [48, "24 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. but this they were prepared to withstand, feeling sure that eventually victory would reward them. In due course of time information was borne to the Conqueror of the resistance to his will which the good people of Exeter were making. Filled with wrath at this behaviour, he placed himself at the head of a large army, and marched towards the city. A sight which surprised him then met his gaze. Instead of the spirits of the citizens being cowed at the king's display of authority, as their monarch had vainly flattered him self would be the case, he discovered that they had assumed an attitude of defiance ; and, in place of finding the gates open to receive him and his army, he was chagrined to discover the walls lined with armed men who, looking down upon him, saluted him with jeers and threats. He had previously sent to the city, demanding its oaths of fealty to his person, and that a garrison should be admitted within the walls. The citizens' answer had taken the form of a peremptory refusal of these demands, but they very properly agreed to pay him such dues and to render him such services as had been tendered to their native monarchs. This state of affairs, however, did not suit the lofty minded William, and the reason of his visit to Exeter was to punish the rebellious citizens. The magistrates had gone out to meet him, and when about four miles distant from the city they found themselves in the royal presence. They begged for the monarch's leniency, and offered hostages for their fidelity."], [49, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 25 We may judge, however, of William's state of mind on finding the reception awaiting him when he arrived outside Exeter, at the head of five hundred horse. He sought to intimidate the people by resorting to the cruel practice of putting out the eyes of one of the hostages; but that availed nothing. For about eighteen days a vigorous siege was maintained, resulting in the destruction of nearly fifty houses, and a severe loss among the besiegers. The citizens behaved right valiantly, but an unex pected occurrence at length decided their fate. A portion of the walls suddenly collapsed, and the enemy immediately poured into the city. Further resistance was, of course, useless ; and thoughts of the wreaking of a terrible vengeance filled the minds of the now naturally distracted people. An agreeable surprise, however, awaited them. In stead of the Conqueror giving orders for a general massacre, he behaved in a most liberal manner, con tenting himself with their oaths of allegiance and the admission of a garrison into the city. In addition, he took steps to secure the property and immunities of the citizens; and, in order that his soldiery might not indulge their plundering propensities, the king removed them some distance from the gates. This behaviour was prompted more by policy than good nature ; but, still, it was a fortunate affair for the people of Exeter. A feeling of confidence possessed the citizens generally, but there were others whose belief in the clemency of the Conqueror was not so firm. After the king's entry"], [50, "26 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. into the city, a party of people hurried towards the Water Gate.* It opened ; and when it closed again it had shut out Githa and a number of citizens, who, fearing William's wrath, were escaping to Flanders. Scarce had one cloud of trouble rolled by than an other hung over the city. The people were loyal to the sovereign \u2014 not because they loved him, but for the reason that fear kept them to their allegiance. For this politic reason they refused to join the malcontents in Cornwall, in 1069. The latter, discovering the dis position of the citizens, proceeded to lay siege to the place ; but the king's lieutenants brought the citizens a speedy relief, and they were spared the sufferings of another siege. As all our readers are aware, the Domesday surveys was established in this reign'; and a vestige of the customs enforced at the ringing of the Curfew is still to be found in the tolling of the bell of our old cathedral at eight o'clock every night. Of a still evening what romantic feelings \"the ringing of the Curfew\" will some times arouse in our breasts, and back over what ages of time our thoughts will travel ! * Simeon of Durham says this event occurred the following year. t Camden says :\u2014 \" Exeter did not geldt (that is, pay the quota of taxes) but when London, York and Winchester did, that was a mark of silver for a Knight's fee, in case of an expedition by land or sea, it served after the rate of five hides (a hide of land containing 100 acres) : at the time of this survey the King had in this city three hundred and fifteen houses ; it paid fifteen pounds a year, and forty-eight houses were destroyed after the king came to England.\""], [51, ""], [52, "THE MI /ST. /96*t -"], [53, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 27 Several great works were executed in our city at the instigation of the Conqueror. In addition to appointing Baldwin de Brioniss to superintend the work of build ing a castle, William was the original founder of the Benedictine Priory of St. Nicholas (situated in the Mint), which was a dependency of the Abbey of Battle, in Sussex. During the Conqueror's reign Exeter seems to have grown and prospered, and the inhabitants, even at that stage of their history, carried on an ex tensive trade with foreign countries. But, although so prosperous, it had its share of natural troubles and disasters to suffer. Prominent among these was a visitation in the shape of an earthquake, for the record of which an old manuscript in the Bodlean Library is responsible. According to our authority, in the middle of a certain night in the year 1080 \" a terrible and unaccustomed noise, with lightning and thunder, came suddenly with a motion of the earth, and caused great ruin of houses.\" The inhabitants were stricken with fear, for they thought it was a judgment of God come upon them. With the reign of the next monarch (William II.) our history has not much to do. The monks of St. Nicholas had, however, to thank the king for the donation of a piece of land which is now known as the Old Cemetery, but which, from the nature of the gift, was called Fryer's-hays. To the prior he granted a charter for the holding of an annual fair on the festival of St. Nicholas (6th December), and likewise granted him and his successors for ever a moiety of a fair"], [54, "28 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. which (held in the city long before the Conquest), was called Crollditch Fair ; shreds of which, at the present day, remain in the shape of Lammas fair. This, from a fixture of importance, has at last dwindled down to a solitary sweet stall in Fore Street, a drum and fife procession of the mace-bearers, and the hoist ing of the glove at the guildhall. There the latter originally remained for the space of three days, during which time no arrests were made. Passing on to the reign of Henry I.,* we find that monarch befriending Exeter, giving it a new charter in which great privileges were embodied. The inhabitants were granted the fee-farm of their city for the annual payment of is. 6d. to the crown, were freed from the impost of tolls and customs in the other cities and towns of England, and persons interfering with the burgesses of Exeter in the exercise of their chartered rights found themselves liable to a forfeiture of The is. 6d. mentioned in the previous sentence Henry made over to his queen, Matilda, who was held in such veneration by the citizens that annually, up to the 4th September, 1528, the obit of \" Molde the good Queene \" was maintained at the expense of the mayor and council of Exeter. * Early in this reign William Warelwast, Bishop of Exeter, under took the task of rebuilding the Cathedral, to which further reference will be made later on."], [55, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 29 CHAPTER VII. The city besieged by King Stephen\u2014 Capitulates through dearth of water \u2014 Exeter during the reign of Henry II. IT is again our task to turn attention to the old city at a period when the terrors of a siege were overtaking it. Once more Exeter was preparing to withstand the assault of the invader ; once more the valiant citizens were to bid him defiance from the substantial walls ; and once more the standard was to float from its citadel in the championship of right. By intrigue and fair promises combined, Stephen had con trived to obtain the crown ; but the citizens, recognising the lawful pretensions of Matilda (or Maud), the only surviving child of the late king, resolved to muster on her side. Among the barons also on Matilda's side was Bald win de Riparis, or Rivers, Earl of Devon, who betook himself to the Castle and well fortified it against attack. The citizens refused to admit the king within the walls, and then the siege began in real earnest. We are assured by an eye-witness of the transaction,* that when the King came to invest the Castle the gallant defenders within mounted the walls in their shining armour and bade him defiance. The besiegers received * Described in Gesta regis Stephani apud Duchesn, page 934. \u2014 Jenkins."], [56, "30 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. no rest at their hands. At times, when least expected, a door would secretly open, a body of the besieged rush out, and ere they retreated again within the walls many of the enemy would be lying dead. When not engaged in this kind of strategy, showers of darts and arrows from the walls would remind the King's army of the tough bone they had to pick in the shape of the gallant defenders of the City. The King and his body, on the other hand, were untiring in their molestations. At one stage of the conflict, a strong and well-armed body of foot soldiers made a desperate assault on the barbican. A fearful struggle ensued, but it was carried by the enemy at last. Encouraged by this success, the latter vigorously continued the attack, and soon succeeded in breaking down the bridge of communication between the Castle and the City. Lofty towers of wood were next erected to protect the King's men, and to enable them to return the discharges from the walls ; and other appa ratus was put up, by the aid of which observation could be made of what was going on inside the City. Machines for battering and breaking down the walls were brought to bear ; the slingers of the army cast into the City \"intolerable showers of stones\"; everything was done to harass and distress the citizens ; but they yielded not. For three months the battle for the right pro ceeded, for three months the citizens determined to suffer any extremities rather than yield to the man who had robbed the crown from the woman whose cause they were championing; but at length a terrible dearth"], [57, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 31 of water compelled them to open the gates to the enemy. This siege had cost Stephen an expenditure of 15,000 marks; and, notwithstanding the capitulation, the citizens, throughout the war between Stephen and the Empress Maud, continued to firmly advocate the cause of her on whose behalf the King had been defied and the city driven to the sufferings of a siege. Allowing for the exasperated state of mind in which Stephen must have been in consequence of the city's opposition, it might reasonably have been expected that on the surrender of the place he would have amply revenged himself. This, however, does not appear to have been the case; and, on the other hand, he seems to have indemnified the clergy of the Cathedral for the injury inflicted on it during the siege; and to have contented himself with confiscating the property of Baldwin and banishing him to Normandy. The succession of Henry II. (the first of the Planta genets) created satisfaction in Exeter, as it did throughout the country generally ; and during the reign of this monarch prosperity reigned in the City. As an acknow ledgment of the steadfast manner in which the inhabitants had upheld his mother's cause, he granted them a new charter, confirming all the rights and privileges they possessed in the time of Henry I., his grandfather, as \" freely honourably and justly \" as the barons (the merchant princes and aldermen) of London held and enjoyed theirs; and, in addition, new fortifications were added to the City. In the contest between the King and the Primate"], [58, "32 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. Thomas, Bartholomew, the then Bishop of Exeter, is alleged to have taken part against the latter ; but Dr. Oliver points out that though \"in the early stage of the contest, he sought, from his love of peace, to moderate and reconcile differences,\" yet he soon dis covered his mistake, and henceforward endeavoured to do all in his power to serve the Primate, regardless of the risk of incurring the King's ill-will. The Bishop was, the same learned writer assures us, a staunch advocate of the liberties of his See, and its churches ; and ever did his best to advance the interests of the same. By royal command, it was now decreed that \"every citizen possessed of a knight's fee, should provide a pair of cuirasses, shield, and spear ; and every layman that had goods and revenue to the value of sixteen marks, a pair of cuirasses, helmet, and shield ; and every inhabitant worth ten marks, an habergeon, a steel cap, and a spear ; that they might at all times be ready to defend the city committed to their care.\"* Among other matters worthy of record in this reign, is the information that the liberty to bury Jews in Exeter was given, up to this date all members of the Hebrew race having to find a final earthly resting place in London. In 1164, an almhouse for poor people was founded in the City, by William Fitz- Ralph. It was dedicated to St. Alexis, and Jenkins, in his History of Exeter, says it was probably situated in \" Gandy's Lane, anciently called St. Lucie's Lane, a common abridgment for St. Alexis.\" Seventy years * Jenkins."], [59, ""], [60, "OLD CRAMMAFi S CH O O X F/? \u00a3M /S\u00a3S:"], [61, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 33 later, the foundation was \" dissolved,\" and added to St. John's Hospital, a fine old building, inside the East gate, which was removed a year or two ago to make room for the new Post Office and other buildings. In the same reign, the Priory of St. James (for monks of the Cluniac order) was founded. This priory, which occupied the site of what is now known as the Old Abbey, near Salmon Pool, was richly endowed by the founder, Baldwin de Rivers, Earl of Devon. Up to the year 1760, a great part of the old priory remained, but at that date it was taken down and a farm house (the Old Abbey) erected on the site.\"* St. James's weir is close by this building. In the year 11 61, fires created great destruction in the city ; but, as regards the remainder of the reign, we have nought but satisfactory records handed down to us.

By both of these mon- archs charters were granted and privileges renewed and confirmed. During this period trade still continued to flourish, its inhabitants to increase, and the city came to be looked upon as a place of the greatest import ance in the western quarters of England. In Richard's reign, corporation charters were granted for the forming of different trades into guilds ; and during the sove reignty of King John (in the year 1200) a charter was extended to the citizens of Exeter empowering them to elect annually a mayor and two bailliffs or stewards, up to this time the provosts, or rulers, being nominated by the earls of Devon (a custom which had survived from the Norman Conquest). During the contests between King John and his barons, the citizens defended the cause of his Majesty, and declined to allow the rebels to enter the city. On this advocacy John set a high value, and in the year 1216 he sent a commission to the Governor of Exeter"], [63, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 35 Castle (Robert de Courtenay, Viscount of Devon), order ing him to admit into the city William Brewere and his forces, provided the city was not already sufficiently garrisoned. Instructions were further given that if the Viscount was unable to defend the city he was to retire within the Castle ; and in the same year we have record of the fact that Peter de Malolan was directed to hand to the Governor's chaplain the sum of thirty pounds, with which to pay the Castle force. It was amid bright prospects that Henry III. ascended the throne ; but the prudence which characterised the commencement of his rule soon gave place to the impo litic folly which rendered him the plaything of favourites and foreigners. The influence of this lamentable change of demeanour manifested itself in a demand for the in discriminate surrender of wards and castles. Robert de Courtenay was called upon to give up his hereditary right of Governor of the Castle of Exeter, and the king's own brother, Prince Richard, Earl of Poitou and Corn wall, was installed in his stead, the City and Castle being (on the ioth August, 1231) granted him as an appendage of the earldom of Cornwall. The new Governor frequently kept court in the city; and it is said that he \" behaved with condescension and liberality towards its burgesses.\"* Prior to this (in the year 1218) there had been a con test between Robert de Courtenay and Henry, son of Reginald, Earl of Cornwall, concerning the possession of the Castle, the former claiming it as his hereditary right. * Dr. Oliver."], [64, "36 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. Henry deprived him of the Castle for some time, but at length, by the king's command, he gave it up to Robert, as being part of his baron}' of Okehampton. This did not end the dispute, however, and on March 28th, 12 19, the custody of the Castle and county of Devon was commit ted to Robert de Albermarle. The following May, how ever, Robert de Courtenay found himself in possession of his rights, which he held until deprived of them by Richard, Earl of Cornwall. The local events occurring in this reign were important indeed. In 1222, the parishes of Exeter were regulated, and the number of parish churches reduced to nineteen ; the following year the citizens heard with feelings of proper pride the intelligence that Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, and a native of the city, had divided the whole Bible into chapters ; about the year 1236, St. Catherine's Priory, for Benedictine nuns, situ ated at Polsloe, about a mile from Exeter, in the neigh bourhood of Whipton, was founded by William Brewer, Bishop of Exeter; in 1238, the Hospital of St. John (before referred to) was founded by Gilbert and John Long, of Exeter ; and the year 1257 saw the foundation of old Exe Bridge. To the latter structure an important history attaches. Up to this period the only accommodation for people in crossing the ford at the lower end of the city was a ferry. In addition to the general inconvenience of this means of passage the lives of many poor people (who could not afford to pay the ferryman) were lost, in their endeavours to ford the stream.

An appeal to the humanity and liberality of the people of the Diocese resulted (together with Gervis's own donation) in the collection of nearly ten thousand pounds towards the building of a stone bridge of twelve arches. The piers of the structure rested on piles, and the stones of the foundation were cramped with iron and run with lead. Guardians were appointed for the perpetual maintenance of the bridge, towards which Gervis left lands at his decease. It is believed that Gervis was buried in the Chantry Chapel, founded by him and his first wife, Alice, on the bridge, nearly opposite St. Edmund's Church ; and Dr. Oliver says that when the chantry was taken down, in July, 1833, \" the only skeleton found was that of a tall man, lying about eighteen inches below the surface, with the feet towards the door, the body lying in a direct line ; and it was decently re-interred in the same site.\" In a deed of the chamber of Exeter, bearing date February 4th, 1403, is contained the appointment of Thomas Losquiet, clerk, to serve the chantry, which was then vacant, and specially to \"pray and celebrate\" for the souls of Walter Gerveys and Alice, his wife, the founders of the chantry ; also for the souls of their pre decessors and successors ; for the mayor and commonalty of Exeter, and all benefactors to the bridge.

The real culprit was wanting when enquiries for him were being made ; but, if what is recorded be true, it was decided not to cheat the gallows and disappoint the morbid. Therefore, Alfred Duport, who had been eight times Mayor, and the porter of South Gate, \" were both indicted, arraigned, found guilty and executed accordingly, for that the South Gate was that night left open, by which means the murderer escaped.\" In consequence of the enacting of this tragedy, a deed was granted to the Dean and Chapter, giving them per- * During his Majesty's stay in Exeter, at Christmas, he held a Parlia ment at which he remedied the abuses of coroners, who, during the turbulent times, had been remiss in their duties."], [70, "40 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. mission to form the Close round the Cathedral, \" for the better security of the resident clergy,\" and the following gates were then erected: \u2014 St. Michael's (Broadgate), St. Martin's Berkley (St. Catherine's), Palace Dean (adjoining the site of Bear Street), St. George's (at the Littlestill), and St. Petrock's (near the Globe Hotel). The year 1284 saw the foundation of the House of Grey Friars, on land adjacent to what is now known as Friars-gate (Holloway Street). Up to now this frater nity had their residence in South Street, but at length, as they increased in numbers, they found the place (as Jenkins put it) \" too small and inconvenient for their lordly stomachs.\" Having obtained from the Earl of Cornwall a grant of \" all that large spot of land situated on the south side of a street then called Larrokbeareway (now Holloway), and from the City Ditch to Larrokbeare Ditch,\" they began to build a \" sumptuous convent.\" As jealousy among religious sects had taken the pains to be born long before this date, it is not a matter of surprise that opposition to the movement manifested itself in certain quarters. Bishop Quivil was among the enemies of the Grey Friars in this matter, and he did all in his power to upset the building scheme and hinder the projectors in their progress. His Majesty the King was, however, appealed to, and royal license to continue the building was granted. But Quivil, continued his opposition ; and when, later on, he was accidentally choked while drinking a syrup, the Grey Friars, by no means distressed at the occurrence, gave out that a Divine judgment had overtaken the foe to their project !"], [71, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 41 The convent, which was finished at the king's death, continued until the general suppression of such houses. The land on which it was built (called Friars-hays) was, at the time that Jenkins published his History of Exeter (early in the present century), the property of Captain Richard Graves, who had married the daughter of the late proprietor, Sir John Colleton, Bart.* A circumstance exceedingly interesting, as concerning the city's prosperity, occurred about 1285. In this year the citizens had cause to complain to the King that Isabella, Countess of Devon, was endeavouring to encroach on their liberties and privileges. His Majesty confirmed the rights of the complainants, but five years had not passed ere the Countess had her revenge on the people of Exeter by construct ing a dam across the river, at a spot still known as Countess Weir. This prevented vessels coming up to the Quay as they had previously done, and as the citizens were being greatly injured in this way, they once more appealed to the King. Sir Malcolm Harleigh (his Majesty's escheator) came down and held an in quiry, and the jurors, who consisted of the principal landowners of the Wonford Hundred, decided in favour of the citizens. Sir Malcolm Harleigh also held another inquiry at the Dean's house, at which it was proved, among other * There is at present a Colleton Crescent near the site of the monas tery. Recently (September, 1885) Town Council labourers, whilst excavating in Friars' Gate, came across human skulls and other remains, portions of which are in possession of the author."], [72, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 42 things, that Exeter, which had pertained to the Crown both before and since the Conquest, was held in fee-farm rent of the Earl of Cornwall (^\"35 10s. yearly), and that the jurisdiction of the city over the river extended from Exe Bridge to the Port of Exmouth. The obstruction placed in the river by Countess Isabella, however, had had the effect of injuring the salmon and other fishing industries, and whereas, formerly, boats and vessels were able to come right up to the Bridge of the city and discharge their cargoes, the navigation of the river was now completely ruined. His Majesty, on having this fact placed before him, directed the confirmation of the citizens' rights, and ordered that the nuisance complained of should be removed. The royal mandate, however, yielded but partial obedience. Instead of the weir being removed, it was merely cut through the middle, and the abutments remaining at each end lessened the flow of the tide, and decreased the size of the channel. Through these causes sand and rubbish accumulated to such an extent that the passage was greatly obstructed, and only small barges were enabled to pass through en route to the city. In the following reign a dispute between the Earl of Devon (Hugh Courtenay) and the Mayor and citizens occurred, which had the effect of completing the ruin of the navigation of the river. The origin of the dispute was a singularly trifling one, but it goes to show how very great evils might arise from a very small beginning. On a certain fast day, the servants of the Earl and of the Bishop went to the Exeter Market to buy fish. There"], [73, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 43 were, however, only three pots of this commodity in the market, and as each of the menials appeared determined to become sole possessors ofthe trio, a great quarrel arose among them. This had the effect of drawing a crowd around the disputants, and a riot ensued, which the Mayor, in due time, arrived to quell. His settlement of the dispute was a most equitable one. He ordered that a pot of the fish should be given to the Earl's servant, another to the Bishop's domestic, and the third was to be reserved to the use of the citizens. A Solomon could not have delivered better judgment, but the Earl thought himself greatly aggrieved in not having the whole of the fish allotted to him. In an angry mood he hastened to his house in the City and demanded that the Mayor should immediately appear before him. His worship, however, was a shrewd, as well as a just, man, and he refused to risk the con sequences of meeting the proud and violent-tempered Earl without taking necessary precautions beforehand. He, accordingly, requested the citizens to attend at the Guildhall. He there informed them of the Earl's disposition, and considering that elements of danger were not absent from the dispute, invited them to accompany him to the house of Courtenay. Acting in that spirit of loyalty which the people of Exeter have almost invariably manifested towards the head man of the city, they readily assented to the Mayor's request. Directly the latter was ushered into the Earl's presence, the door was closed upon him, and a storm of abuse and threats immediately broke over his"], [74, "44 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. head. The Mayor tried conciliatory means to appease the Earl's wrath, but they did not answer; and he accordingly took other steps to convince his antagonist of his folly. He held lands of the Earl by tenure, and, according to custom, his worship appeared in Courtenay's presence wearing a Tabard. Finding that the latter would not listen to reason, he took off the livery and handed it to him. This had the effect of increasing the Earl's fury tenfold, and as the quarrel rapidly became more serious, the people who were waiting without, thinking they would prefer their Mayor safe and sound, instead of gathering him up in instalments, demanded that he should be let out of the room ; and as the Earl refused this reasonable request, they proceeded to save him further trouble by attempting to burst open the door. Not caring to make the acquaintance of the Mayor's supporters just at that moment, the Earl turned to his worship and requested him to endeavour to pacify the people. He succeeded in doing this, and the crowd dispersed ; and the Earl, to show his gratitude for this forbearance, thenceforward cherished a bitter hatred towards the citizens, and did all in his power to trample on their rights and to injure their city ! The result of this antagonism was that the Council passed a bye-law forbidding any enfranchised man of the City to wear the livery or badge of any non-freeman, without license from the Mayor. The Earl, on his part, proceeded to show that in his mental dictionary he had discovered the meaning of the word \" revenge.\" The opening which had been made at Countess Weir for the"], [75, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 45 passage of vessels he had filled up, this being done by chaining large trees together at the spot, with stones and gravel inserted between to render their removal im possible. He also caused two additional weirs to be constructed \u2014 one opposite St. James's Priory (still known as St. James's Weir, near Salmon Pool), and another at a place then called Lampreys, but which is at present designated Trew's Weir. But as this hardly came up to his views of substantial vengeance, he constructed a quay at his \"mansion of Topsham\": his purpose being to deprive the city of all its commercial advantages. In this way, the trade of Exeter suffered a shock from which it is believed to have never properly recovered. And only to think of the origin of all this trouble. \"A pretty kettle of fish,\" indeed ! Let us be thankful that the present noble Earl of Devon does not emulate in any way his illustrious, but choleric and vindictive, ancestor. The citizens complained to the king of the Earl's arbitrary conduct, but were unable to obtain any redress. Courtenay continued to encroach on their rights and liberties, and though in 1316 the King, upon enquiry, sent down writs in the city's favour, they still failed to obtain justice \u2014 a disgusting piece of evidence of the des potic characters which the Earls of that period were allowed to develop, and betraying a spirit of unreasonable meekness wbich happily is not characteristic ofthe average Exonian of the present day."], [76, "46 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER.

In the year 1275, renewed liberty was given to the Mayor and citizens to collect tolls on goods sold in the City, the proceeds being applied towards the maintenance of the latter ; high waters prevailing in the year 1286 washed away a large portion of Exe Bridge, but it was afterwards repaired, \"at the sole charge of the citizens\"; in 1292, a rich citizen (Ongarus de Sancto Milone) gave the whole manor of Stoke Wood, which was united to the manor of Stoke Canon, to the Dean and Chapter of Exeter ; the same year the Priory of Cowick, near the city, was founded, either by Lord Courtenay, or one of the family of De Brionis ;* in 1295, a praiseworthy measure was adopted in carrying out the command of the King to punish bakers, brewers, and millers who were found to add qualities other than that of honesty to their business capacities ; and in 1 297, the King, whilst staying in the city (on a tour through Devon) took \u2666 There is a doubt whether Lord Courtenay made it more than denizen."], [77, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 47 the opportunity of settling a dispute between the citizens and the Dean and Chapter, \" concerning the right of a free passage through a lane that led to the city walls, between St. Catherine's nunnery and the Black Friars (now Egypt Lane), which the clergy endeavoured to stop up.\"* It was decided that the citizens had the right of a free passage to the walls, which they were bound by charter to repair and defend. In the year 1299, the mayor and citizens were appointed sole guardians of the Port of Exeter, and they were invested with a power to search for and seize all gold or silver which it was intended to send out of the kingdom. During the same year an en quiry revealed the fact that with the lands of a freeman the freedom of the city also descended ; and the Mayor was chosen by four and twenty freemen of the City on oath. In 1 30 1, some of the lawyers of the period were enabled to grow fat over a dispute between the Dean and Chapter and the Prior and Friar Preachers, as to whether or not the corpse of Sir Henry Rawleigh, Knight, should be presented at the Cathedral prior to its interment in the Friars' Church, to which these latter good people begged leave to object. The Dean and Chapter thought it consistent with decency and religion to have the corpse forcibly presented at the Cathedral, but when they sent it back to the Convent the Friars said, in effect, \" since you wanted the body so badly, now you had better keep it,\" and closed their gates against it. It remained so long unburied, however, that it emitted a * Jenkins."], [78, "48 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. fearful stench, and at last, for the sake of their own comfort, the Friars thought it best to inter the remains. The Friars had the worst of the law suit, and it was decided that thenceforward any person who died in the city or suburbs should not be buried in their Church without first being presented at the Cathedral Church of St. Peter. It was decided by an ordinance, bearing date 1304, that provisions were to be sold in the market place on pain of forfeiture ; and two years later the city was honoured by the birth of Walter of Excester, a learned man, who ended his days in the Cell of St. Caroke, in Cornwall, whither he had repaired, and is said to have worked all sorts of wonders. In the year 13 12, the mayor and bailiffs were appointed justices of the peace, a proceeding which decreased the power of the earl and increased that of the citizens. Four years later a dread ful pestilence and famine devastated the country. Exeter does not appear to have escaped, and the bakers, who were cowards enough to take advantage of the people's necessity, made their bread of an inferior quality and smaller than the assize fixed by the mayor. They were happily detected, fined, and very properly imprisoned until the penalties were paid. Seventeen bakers residing within the Bishop's liberty, claimed to be exempted from the jurisdiction of the Mayor ; but their scruples were overruled, and they were treated as the other offenders were. The Scots having taken a trip to this country for their own delectation, the king (in 1318) demanded assistance"], [79, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 49 of the citizens, who responded by supplying and main taining thirty soldiers ; and three years afterwards, his majesty demanding a subsidy, we are told that the good people of Exeter \" cheerfully \" granted the same to the extent of every sixth penny of the worth of their goods and chattels. The next year the citizens had to fight (in a law suit) for their rights to the manor of Exe Island, and the suburbs without Westgate, which the Earl of Devon claimed to be his ancient demesne, as a portion of the barony of Okehampton (and as such exempted from the jurisdiction of the Mayor). But the citizens won the day, they being equally fortunate in combatting the claims of the earl and the Prior ot St. Nicholas in a dispute concerning the customs, liberties and privileges of Lammas Fair. Looking at the city from a political point of view during the latter part of this period, its atmosphere was not too clear. About the year 1318, the city was favoured with the presence of one John Poudras, or Powderham, the son of a tanner, who got a good many people to swallow the notion that he was the lawful son of King Edward I., and that, having been stolen from his cradle by the nurse, the reigning king was substituted for him. However, on being apprehended he admitted being an impostor, and was accordingly introduced to the executioner. Isaacke (an old Exeter chronicler) says that Poudras was induced to the crime by a familiar spirit which he kept by him in the shape of a cat, which, however, failed him at the most critical time. Jenkins not unreasonably thinks that the cat D"], [80, "50 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. should have been executed with him ; but, had the deluded creature, Poudras, lived in the present time it is a question whether he would not have been accommodated with a room at Digby's instead of being handed over to the hangman. Poudras is not the only individual who has \" seen cats,\" and imagined himself a king. Our closing remarks concerning this period are of an unhappy character. The disputes between the king and queen which took place during the latter part of Edward II. 's reign culminated in the latter endeavouring to fly from England, leaving the Bishop of Exeter (Walter Stapledon) Custos of London. The people of that city, however, opposed the king's cause, and having murdered the Bishop by decapitating him, they threw the body into the Thames."], [81, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 51 CHAPTER XI.

On the 18th of March, 1337, Edward the Black Prince was created Duke of Cornwall, and as Exeter was ordered to remain a parcel of the Duchy, he thus became the receiver of its fee-farm rent, a year. Of the wars between England and France at this period, and the splendid valour displayed by the Prince at the battle of Poictiers, all readers of English history are aware. The citizens of Exeter assisted King Edward in his campaign against the French by placing at his disposal three ships, each manned by sixty mariners and twenty archers. There are historians who tell us that they had some little return for the outlay in the shape of the novelty of gazing on the French King and other royal prisoners whom the Black Prince brought with him to the city, en route to London. Modern writers, however, look upon this as an illusion which it has been their duty to dispel, for it seems that"], [82, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 52 the Prince and party instead of landing at Plymouth and coming to Exeter, embarked at Sandwich, and proceeded by easy journeys to the Metropolis. He appears, how ever, to have come here in the year 1371, and being in a weak state of health, stayed several days for rest, being elegantly entertained at the residence of the mayor \u2014 but at the expense of the city. Among other items of interest, we may mention that about the year 1329 a new charter was granted by the King to the citizens, by which it was stipulated that no freeman should implead another freeman out of the city ; in the year 1348 a long pending law suit determined in the Court of King's Bench, Westminster, decided that the Quay, Passage and Lastage at Prattished, near Exmouth, belonged to the citizens of Exeter; in 1354 a Recorder was first appointed ; and in 1362 the bakers once more became obstreperous, and refusing to bake (because they could not make and sell their bread according to their own quality and assize), were fined each \u00a3\\ 6s. 8d. Emulators of Ananias appear to have been in existence at this period, as well as in more modern times, for on at least two occasions false information concerning the people of Exeter was given to the King. In the year 1344, when his Majesty was in France, he was wrongly informed of a riot in the city; and in 1367 the Dean and Chapter, who were plaintiffs in an action against the late Mayor, the Commonalty and Bailiffs, complained that the Mayor had ordered the citizens to attend him in arms at the succeeding assizes (when the action would be tried), for the purpose of intimidating the justices and the jury,"], [83, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 53 and hindering the lawful procedure of the case. An enquiry, however, proved the charge to be groundless. In common with the rest of the country, Exeter severely felt the ravages of the Black Pestilence, which prevailed at this period. The city was nearly depopu lated, and it is stated that the great mortality had so lessened the consumption of provisions that \" a fine ox was sold for 4/-, the best cow at 1/- and the best hog at 5d.\"* Such repose as the city might have been enjoying when the young King Richard II. came to the throne was interrupted a year subsequently, when the French, after having managed to burn Plymouth and Dartmouth, endeavoured to make their way up the Exe to Exeter. The citizens made due preparations for defence, but they were spared the pains of a prolonged resistance, by the attention of the French being diverted to a more suitable object of attack. Inhabitants of Devon and Somerset (among them being Sir Philip and Sir Peter Courtenay, sons of the Earl of Devon) fitted out a number of ships, but indiscreetly attacking the French fleet they were overpowered, and had to take a trip to France against their wills. During all the national troubles the citizens stuck firm to the cause of the King, arming, manning, and victual ling, in one instance, a large ship, to add to the powerful fleet which his Majesty had organised to protect the English coasts from French invasions. Their loyalty * Jenkins."], [84, "54 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. was not passed unheeded, and the city had its reward in the shape of charters renewing and enlarging their privi leges and liberties. An Act of Parliament was passed in the year 1380, which affected Exeter, among other places, and which prohibited fishmongers, butchers, and grocers from taking the office of Mayor, etc.; and 1387 has an interesting connection, as being the year in which the cordwainers and curriers were first incorporated. It is our duty to record that in this reign (in 1378 and 1398) the plague again caused havoc among the people of the City ; that a heavy flood, in 1384, carried away a part of Exe Bridge and drowned several people ; that, in 1398, the first Duke of Exeter was created, in the person of John Holland,* Earl of Huntingdon ; and then, to add to that we have nothing else of interest to mention so far as the reign of that luckless monarch Richard II. is concerned. The following reign (that of Henry IV.) is distinguished locally by the institution of the City Waits, a band which attended the Mayor on all \" solemn occasions,\" and by the citizens being confirmed (by verdict, 1412) in their right to town duties. The reign of Henry V., so far as Exeter is concerned, was comparitively barren ; but passing to the time of his successor to the throne, we note that, in 1424, the demand of the King for a subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage, * Holland was beheaded by order of the King in the following reign, he being one of the many victims of Henry IV. 's jealous and suspicious disposition."], [85, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 55 towards defraying the expenses of his wars with France was \" cheerfully \" responded to. In the same year was commenced the custom of giving the Mayor and Alder men, at Christmas and Easter, a quantity of bread and wine (commonly designated \" canon bread and wine \") ; and, in 1428, we have the bakers discreditably to the fore again. These people objected to the assize of bread set by the Mayor, and accordidgly decided among them selves that they would discontinue the custom of \"giving what was termed advantage bread, or one penny on a dozen.\"* In order to more effectually carry out their purpose they subsequently refused to bake at all. The Mayor, however, thinking this a convenient opportunity at which to seriously interpose, heavily fined the offenders, and committed the Master, Wardens, and chief of the culprits to prison. There their mental condition underwent a wholesome change, and they publicly acknowledged their error. The bakers were not permitted to monopolise the privilege of upsetting the City's tranquillity. The butchers refused to sell in the shambles, plying their trade at their own houses instead, but the opportunity of inspecting the interior of the prison, and the privilege of paying a heavy fine induced them to cancel the agreement they had come to among themselves. A summary of the other more important events in this reign shall conclude the present chapter, for the close of which, considering its \" dry \" character, we fancy the reader has been longing. * Jenkins."], [86, "56 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. In 1445, the Dean and Chapter met the want for \" liberal education \" in this city by converting an ancient chapel, dedicated to the Holy Trinity (situated in what is at present Musgrave's Alley, but then known as Trinity Lane), into a High School. Adjoining this, a house was erected for the accommodation of a master, whose salary was fixed at per annum. The disciples of John Wesley converted the school again into a place of wor ship, and in this connection we shall have occasion to refer to it again in a later chapter. At this period the Mayor and his brethren and the Cathedral dignitaries do not seem to have reached that height of affection which would prompt them to fall on each other's necks in the excess of love. On the contrary, they were engaged in a long law suit. This was settled in 1447, it being decided that the Mayor's officers had a right to carry their maces within the Cathedral and its liberty. The Cathedral, in the year 1459, was the scene of a terrible piece of profanity. A party of young gentlemen (evidently looking ahead of time and fancying themselves at a Nineteenth Century political meeting) quarrelled and fought in the body of the sacred building ; and in the melee which followed persons were seriously injured. Blood having been spilt, the Cathedral was shut up and the service discontinued, until the edifice was re consecrated.* With this brilliant example of fifteenth century gentility we will close the chapter. * In the absence of the Bishop, this was done by Thomas, a suffragan to the Bishop of Bath."], [87, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 57 CHAPTER XII. The Wars of the Roses \u2014 The standard of the Lancastrians reared in Exeter \u2014 Royals visit and their objects \u2014 The romantic history of the Causeway in Cowley Bridge Road. mHE commotions which ruffled the country's seren- ity at the period which we dealt with in our last chapter did not fail to make their influence felt in a greater or less degree at Exeter. Jack Cade's Rebellion, in 1450, put royalty on its guard, and a letter from the King warned the citizens to prepare for their defence, and to prevent any rebels being admitted into the City. The insurgents' defeat and Cade's death, how ever, for the time removed the cause for acting on the defensive. It can be easily conceived how necessary it was in these troublous times for the citizens to be in a thorough state of preparation. With a view to this end a custom known as the Midsummer Watch was observed. This was a grand procession which, on Midsummer Eve, paraded the City walls to see if any repairs were required ; after which the principal streets were paraded and the arms of the citizens examined. His Worship the Mayor (accom panied by the Aldermen and Common Council and headed by the city waits, sergeants-at-mace, and other officers, all mounted), was in the van, being followed by the principal"], [88, "58 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. citizens and the incorporated trades in armour. The pageant was a grand one, and the different companies did their best to outdo each other in the matter of splendour. The affair was of the utmost importance and eagerly looked forward to by the citizens; and such value was placed on the ceremony that John Kelly, the late Mayor, was fined ten marks for refusing to attend in his place, according to custom, in the year 1458. The participators in the ceremony fully appreciated its import ance, and in the year we have just referred to there was a dispute between the cordwainers and tuckers as to the right of precedence in the procession. The dispute was referred to the Mayor, who, with a splendid idea of equity, ordered the contending companies to walk to gether, one of each company hand in hand. Six years prior to the date of this dispute, however (1452), the citizens were gratified at the sight of a gorgeous procession with another object. The King was on a tour through his domains, and his advent to Exeter was a matter of all-absorbing interest. On coming into Devonshire his Majesty stayed a night at Ford Abbey, near Axminster, and after subsequently passing a couple of nights at Ottery St. Mary, he reached Honiton Clist. There he was received by the Devonshire nobility and gentry, and shortly afterwards a brilliant party arrived from Exeter to give the King an honourable welcome. The Mayor was attended by upwards cf three hundred citizens, attired in gorgeous liveries. On arriving at Liverydole (Heavitree) the communities of the Francis can and Dominican Convents, who had assembled at St."], [89, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 59 Clara's Chapel,* joined in the procession. The Bene dictine Prior of St. Nicholas, and the Augustinian Prior of St. John's Hospital, with the parochial clergy and chaplains, met the royal procession at the Great Cross outside Southgate. His Majesty having saluted the Cross, the keys of Southgate were handed to him by the Mayor, who rode in advance, carrying the mace before him. The streets of the city were hung with silks and tapestry, and as the procession proceeded the spectacle was a gorgeous one. At St. Michael's Gate (now Broad gate) his Majesty alighted and proceeded on foot to the Cathedral, where he attended Divine service. He remained eight days at the Palace, being entertained at the expense of the church and the citizens jointly, and afterwards left for London. During the stay of the King in the City his judges, who sat in the Bishop's Hall, found two men guilty of high treason. They were, however, afterwards pardoned. Dr. Oliver states that they owed their lives to the interces sion of the Bishop and Chapter, but other writers allege that the King extended his clemency to the culprits in order to humour a whim of the clergy, who contended that the judges sitting within their sanctuary was con trary to the privileges of the Holy Church. In Exeter, as well as other places, the contentious feeling evoked by the quarrels between the houses of York and Lancaster was experienced. The outrage in the Cathedral, to which we have already referred, very probably had its origin in this sort of partizanship. * Liverydole."], [90, "60 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon, and Lord William Bonville, of Shute, seriously quarrelled from the same cause. Courtenay stood up for the interests of the Lan castrians, and Bonville was an adherent to the cause of the Yorkists. The upshot of all this was a fight between the parties on Clist Heath, and Bonville getting the worst of it, he retreated with his band to Exeter. Once inside, the gates were closed upon them, and the Earl who was pursuing the fugitives, not being able to effect an entrance, took umbrage thereat, and put the City down even a few pegs lower than before in his estimation. As our readers are by this time aware, bad feeling had long existed between the citizens and the Courtenay family, and this probably had more to do with the course the former had adopted than adherence to either of the conflicting bands. In 1460, the King was taken prisoner at the Battle of St. Albans, by the Duke of York ; and at the solicitation of the Queen the citizens sent thirty-one soldiers and a large sum of money towards the army which she was organising for the release of his Majesty, at the same time setting forth their loyalty to his cause. During the continuance of the dispute in the reign of Edward IV., the standard of Henry was set up in Exeter, and here, when the landing of Queen Margaret with troops at Weymouth raised the spirits of her party, the Lancas trians assembled. On Saturday, the 14th April, 1470, the City was honoured with another royal visit, but there were many who doubted what the issue of it would be, considering"], [91, "61 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. that Exeter had been the asylum of refuge for many of Edward's foes, and the opposition to his adherent, Lord Courtenay, could not be forgotten. Edward had come in pursuit of the Duke of Clarence, the Earl of Warwick, and others of the Lancastrian leaders ; but he had come too late, for by this time they had embarked at Dartmouth, en route to France, whither they were escap ing. The King, however, thought it politic not to make manifest his anger at the citizens' behaviour, but, rather to try to win their affections to himself. Once more, then, a grand procession of the Mayor and citizens on horseback, filed out of the city to Liverydole, to meet a king. On the party (having reached Exeter at last) entering at East Gate the Mayor handed his Majesty the keys and maces, and at the Guildhall he was presented with a purse containing a hundred roubles. The keys and maces were redelivered to the Mayor ; but that his Majesty did not part with the purse of gold it is needless to add. The following day was Palm Sunday, and the King (bearing the holy palm in his hand) walked in the procession, which extended from the East Gate to the Cathedral. On the Friday he departed, thanking the citizens for their entertainment, and leaving behind him (as a reward for their loyalty) his sword. This weapon he took from his side and gave to the Mayor, ordering that it was to be carried before him and his successors on all public occasions. A request, and, of course, a moderate \"tip\" to one of the mace bearers will at any time bring this curiosity out from its hiding place (among the civic \"properties\"), at the Guildhall for inspection."], [92, "62 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. It will have been seen that the events of our history during Edward's reign were very important ; but there are one or two other matters worth mentioning, in addition to those we have already referred to. In 1466, an act for paving the streets and removing nuisances was procured, the effect being to improve in a great measure the condition of the city. In 1475, the Corpo ration of Tailors obtained a new charter ; but the Mayor and Corporation thinking that their liberties were being in consequence infringed, they commenced a law suit. Royal interference stopped the proceedings, but there was not a superabundance of friendship between the parties for many years afterwards. It seems at this time to have been a custom for the country bakers to bring their bread into Exeter and sell it from door to door. This being highly detrimental to the interests of the City bakers, the council enacted a bye law forbidding the country people to hawk their bread in the City, but giving them permission to sell in the public market, and have standings on market days near the great Conduit at Carfoix (or the four ways), situated at the junction of North Street, South Street, High Street, and Fore Street. Jenkins well remembers \" when the country bakers used to bring their bread in panniers, :and stand with it at the upper end of Cook Row, between the Globe Ale House, and the corner of Fore Street.\" In the latter part of this reign the charters of incorpo ration of the cordwainers and curriers were renewed, and the troublesome bakers were also incorporated under the Common Seal of the Council. Servants of Justice"], [93, "63 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. in 1480 unearthed a forger in the person of John Bonne fant, one of the attorneys of the Exeter Provost Court, who had passed upon him what the people of sixty years since would have termed a very mild sentence. In execution of this, he was carried through the streets, on a market day, on horseback, with a paper on his breast bearing this legend : \u2014 \" For forging false deeds and evidences, and counterfeiting seals ; evidently proved.\" The novelty of the sentence must be the excuse for intro ducing here a matter so comparatively trivial. ,. In passing, we call attention to the fact that the pesti lence which raged in the country in 1479, carried off a large number of people in Exeter ; and having told an interesting story in connection with the formation of the causeway in Cowley Bridge Road, we will say \" Here endeth the 12th chapter.\" People are in the habit of saying some very hard things about the clerics of the days we are now dealing with, but if the history of the Causeway in Cowley Bridge Road (part of which now exists), has any foundation in fact, it will go to shew that the charges of immorality which were made against these men were not altogether groundless, and that the light manner in which their crimes were dealt with would be a disgrace to any age. Our story has its features of sadness as well as of romance, for it records how the acquaintance of a priest and a young woman culminated in the moral destruction of the latter \u2014 no doubt ere then a pious, virtuous girl, who owed her ruin to a too implicit confidence in a \" holy man.\" Either with a desire to hide his shame,"], [94, "64 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. or loath to open, by his conduct, the e/es of the people to a too wide extent, he resolved upon murdering the unfortunate girl whose virtue and peace of mind \u2014 there can be no doubt \u2014 he had both destroyed. Accordingly, he one day induced her to enter with him the Duryard Woods, and there, with none other witness to the foul deed save the God whose servant he professed to be, this priest killed the unhappy victim of his lust. But mark how he atoned for this most terrible crime \u2014 penance was his only punishment. He was condemned to make, without assistance, the pathway by Cowley Bridge Road, a task which he is said to have taken seven years in completing. Thus, those of our young friends who find delight in taking moonlight walks along the Cowley Bridge Road, will observe that the locality is not entirely devoid of some kind of history ; and a young lady, as she strolls with feelings of happiness and confidence along that pleasant causeway, enjoying the society of some amiable member of the othr sex, may do many 'worse things than remember the sadly romantic story of the girl and the priest, and take due warning thereby."], [95, "POPULAR HISTORY CF EXETER. 65 CHAPTER XIII.

Early in November, the King reached Exeter and was met at the East Gate by the Mayor, accompanied by the Aldermen, Common Council, and other civic bodies in a gay procession. The keys of the City and the maces were delivered to Richard by the Mayor ; a purse con taining 200 nobles was also given to his Majesty, and, to endeavour to get the monarch to look upon the inhabitants as favourably as possible, the Recorder (Thomas Hexte), presented an address of welcome and congratulation. Sir Thomas St. Leger (the King's brother-in-law), and Thomas Rame, an Esquire, had been found guilty of treason at the special commission held at Torrington ; and they were taken to Exeter and executed at the Carfoix, the Courtenays and the others who had escaped being out lawed. Among other places visited by the King whilst he was in the City was the Castle. It is said that he enquired the name of it from the Mayor, and that on being answered \" Rougemont,\" he trembled, mistaking the word for Richmond, a soothsayer having told him that he would not live long after he had seen Richmond. It is thought likely, however, that this story was concocted after Richard's death \u2014 not an improbability by any means. The dread in which the King held Richmond, however, is well known. In 1484, he was expecting an attack from the latter, and he therefore demanded twenty soldiers to be provided by Exeter. The royal mandate was"], [97, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 67 complied with, but the services of the men were not required. The next reign was a troublous one for Exeter, as well as other parts of the country. In the year 1497, a rebellion arose in Cornwall, where the people thought they had a grievance in the shape of a new subsidy levied upon them. The rebels marched to Exeter, but the citizens, who were aware of their coming, succeeded in repulsing them. They thereupon shaped their course for Tiverton, were subsequently lead to Black Heath, near London, by Lord Audley ; and were then defeated. In the same year, Perkin Warbeck, who pretended that he was the Duke of York, helped to swell the catalogue of the Citys' disasters. On the 7th of September, he landed at Whitsand Bay, not far from Plymouth, with a limited force at his command, and about ten days afterwards he appeared outside the City walls. He had the honour of emulating the Conqueror and others in their belief that it was only to stand an army in a threatening attitude before the place and then to see the walls fall down. Like his predecessors in this delusion, he was dreadfully mistaken. The citizens were not in a humour for submission, and though the enemy burnt Northgate, and forced an entrance into Eastgate as far as Castle Lane, the courage of the inhabitants was too much for them, and they were driven from the City with a serious loss. There being a report that Sir Edward Courtenay was approaching with a large force, that the King would join him with an army of considerable dimensions, and that"], [98, "68 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. his Majesty had expressed a desire to make an exchange of a thousand marks for Perkin's head, that individual thought it wise to fly for his life. He subsequently surrendered, and in a letter (dated Exeter, October 23rd, 1497), which his Majesty addressed to the Spanish envoy (Don Rodriguez Gonzelles), the King drily remarked that they held Perkins there in safe custody, adding \" we shall bring him with us on our return to London, which we hope will be soon ; when you will be able to see him.\" The King left Exeter on the 3rd of November, but during his stay in the City he sat at the Treasurer's house under the Cathedral Close (which by the way was taken down in 1798, to open up a view of the Eastern part of the Cathedral) for the purpose of witnessing the trials of rebels, who had been taken prisoners and sent to Exeter. The majority of these were found guilty and sentenced to death. The ringleaders were hanged and quartered on Southernhay, but the others, who were bareheaded and had halters round their necks, were brought before his Majesty, when they fell on their knees and cried for mercy. They were pardoned after being severely admonished by the King, and we can guess their joyful feelings thereupon, without troubling the historian about the matter. His Majesty did not forget to acknowledge the loyalty shewn by the citizens in their refusal to admit the rebels, and he promised to advance their interests and protect their privileges. Presumably, having no further use for his Sword and Cap of Maintenance, he graciously pre sented them to the City, commanding that they should be"], [99, ""], [100, "EXETER SWORD-BEARER."], [101, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 69 carried in state before the Mayor on all public occasions \" for the time being for ever.\" In deference to a very proper affection for old customs which the people of Exeter possess, rather than in obedience to his gracious Majesty, King Henry VIL, the Sword and Cap still form an attractive feature of the procession whenever the Mayor and Corporation go forth in state.* The other events of importance in Henry's reign are not numerous. In the year 1501, the Princess Catherine of Spain arrived in the Cit}', and during her stay here, she was honourably and liberally treated. Lest any reader should doubt this, we will add a statement, the very humiliating character of which will go to show how un reasonably far the good people of Exeter have sometimes thought it worth while to go in the exercise of their great spirit of hospitality. The Princess complained that the shifting about of the weathercock on St. Mary Major's steeple by the wind) disturbed her rest, and it was accordingly taken down ! It was subse quently replaced ; certainly an unwise thing to be done, if it was the source of so much annoyance to anyone. Only one other event in this reign claims our atten tion ; and that is the pestilence of 1503, which swept off a large number of persons in the city, including Robert Newton and John Danester (Ex-mayors); and John Guscott and John Nordon (Bailiffs). We will therefore now close this chapter of rebellions, royal visits, and unruly weathercocks. * A sword bearer was then appointed, one Francis Gilbert first filling the office."], [102, "70 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. CHAPTER XIV. The Martyrdom of Thomas Benet \u2014 Religious Houses suppressed in Exeter \u2014 The first English Bible \u2014 The Trade of Exeter during Henry VIII.'s reign. 'HE chief local event in the reign of Henry VIII. \\Hjt was the burning of Thomas Benet, one of the many victims of the religious intollerance which prevailed at this period. Benet was a native of Cam bridge, and Master of Arts of Cambridge University, and he had made the acquaintance of Bilney, who afterwards suffered martyrdom for his conscience sake. Finding, however, that this acquaintanceship was making Cambridge too hot to hold him, Benet, in the year 1524, came down into Devonshire and settled at Torrington. He was, however, a married man ; and therefore under the necessity of doing something to maintain himself and wife ; and in order to do this, he hit upon the expediency of keeping a school. The avocation of schoolmaster did not appear to be among the most flourishing of the times ; and Benet accordingly came to the conclusion that he would be consulting his own interests if he removed to Exeter. To Exeter therefore he came, and opened a small school in the Butcher-row, situated in Smythen Street, a portion of which still bears the name."], [103, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 71 For a time Benet lived there quietly ; but he was one of those men with big hearts and expansive minds, who feel compelled to speak out, no matter what the consequences, when they find things going in a direction which their consciences tell them is not the right. So the progress which the Romish religion was making sorely troubled Benet, and he felt that he could no longer of that progress be a silent spectator. He, therefore, boldly informed his friends that he \"must needs utter his conscience,\" and he avowed his intention of dying, if necessary, in defence of God's true religion. But as in the case of a great many other men, his zeal for the cause he had in hand led him into rashness; and one day he made his way to the Cathedral, and affixed to the door of the edifice a scroll, on which he had written these words : \u2014 \" The Pope is Anti-Christ, and we ought to worship God only and no saints.\" There was a great cry among the Romanists of the city on this discovery, and every effort was made to trace the author of the heresy. Had Benet taken the trouble, or had the desire to exercise a little discretion, he might have escaped the consequences of his act ; but his religious zeal had obtained too great a mastery over him. At the Cathedral the following Sunday, the farce of \" cursing the heretic \" with bell, book and candle was gone through, and Benet, being unable to \" forbear laughing at such merry conceits,\" was suspected, and apprehended."], [104, "72 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. The day following his arrest, he was taken before the Bishop of Exeter; and examined by that dignatory. By this time, a most terrible death was staring him in the face, but his faith made him brave-hearted, and he refused to betray his conscience and appear a coward in the eyes of the world ; although, he might have done this, and have saved his life by a tolerably simple process \u2014 that of re canting. But this he would not do ; and accordingly he was delivered over to the Sheriff of Devonshire (Sir Thomas Dennis), and ordered to be burnt. Sir Thomas gave instructions for the stake to be fixed on Southern hay, but as the Chamber of Exeter refused to allow this to be done, it was removed to Livery Dole,* in the parish of Heavitree. On being brought to the stake, Benet engaged in earnest prayer ; and he exhorted the crowd around to follow his example. He implored them to seek the true knowledge of God, and to have no dealings with what he termed \" man's inventions.\" His bearing was that of a fearless Christian, who was resigned to the fate in store for him. His noble behaviour won him the admiration of the multitude, and many who before had treated him with disdain, now freely confessed that a good man's life was * The place was so-called from the fact that the Magistrates and others went on certain occasions to the spot in livery to dole out pence to the poor.

Two Esquires (Thomas Carew and John Barnehouse), stood beside the stake; and they tried all that persuasion and threats could accomplish to get Benet to recant. But he was proof against all ; his soul long ere then was in far better hands, and was well guarded, now that the great hour of trial was at hand. Benet would not recant. The temptation was great \u2014 it was nothing less than a chance to retain a life which he was about to sacrifice ; but he preferred a martyr's terrible death, because of the glory it wculd gain to him. Finding that persuasions and threats availed not, Barnehouse became enraged, and taking a furze brush on a pike, he threw it into Benet's face, crying out, \" Heretic, pray to our Lad}', or, by God's wounds, I'll make thee do it.\" Benet merely replied: \"Alas! sir, trouble me not,\" and, lifting his hands heavenwards, he cried, \" Father, forgive them.\" The faggots were then set ablaze, and as the fierce flames rose and consumed the mortal substance of that heroic man, he lifted his hands, and straining his gaze upwards, exclaimed, \" Lord, receive my spirit.\" With a prayer on his lips \u2014 of forgiveness for his persecutors, and of Lope for the eternity to come \u2014 he soon passed away from this troublous world ; and whilst the oft-rekindled flames enveloped his fast consuming body, his spirit had freed itself from its earthly bondage, and soared far away into that heaven of rest which he had so long and so nobly struggled to win."], [108, "74 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER In connection with events of a religious order in this reign, it may be stated that in the year 1535, a commission was appointed to visit the Devonshire monasteries, and to enforce regulations as to their future conduct. The year which followed saw the suppression of the lesser houses; and in 1539, the dissolution of the greater took place. The houses suppressed in Exeter and neighbour hood were the following : \u2014 The Priory of St. Nicholas, situated at the Mint. The Priory of St. John the Baptist. The Priory of Polsloe, about a mile from Exeter. The Priory of St. James, occupying the site of what is at present known as Old Abbey, near Salmon Pool. The Priory of Cowick. The Priory of Franciscan, or Grey Friars, outside Southgate. The Priory of the Preaching, or Black Friars, situated on the site of Bedford Circus ; and a Priory of Cister cians, formerly located in South Street, on the site cf the Roman Catholic Church, which has been erected there ; besides many small chapels and chantries.

The forgoing were the most important occurrences in the reign of Henry VIII., but we will briefly refer to others which are worth mentioning. In 1512, the City provided and armed thirty soldiers to accompany Henry in his expedition against the French King ; in 1515, it was legally decided that the parish priests of the city had a right to demand Dominicals in lieu of tithes; a severe frost in the same year killed many persons and created great distress among the poor ; the year 1517 was remarkable for the fact that the Receiver (Richard Duke) and the Bailiffs refused to keep up the old and expensive custom of celebrating the election of Mayor by a public breakfast, and they were fined 40s. each;* in 1536, the Plague again created much havoc among the citizens ; in the year 1537, Exeter had the honour of being made a County of itself, the charters granting the Mayor and Common Council liberty to elect a Sheriff annually ; in 1538, the woollen trade had so greatly increased in the city, that a Wool Market was erected in South Street ; on the 10th August, in the same year, John Bonnefant, Provost Court Attorney, was hanged and quartered on Southernhay, he having been found guilty of high treason ; and we may close this chapter * The Bailiffs of the following year refused to go to the expense of providing the breakfast, and they were subjected to a similar penalty. t The date ofthe Charter conferring the privilege is August 23rd, 1537."], [110, "76 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. with the gratifying intelligence that the trade of the city was so flourishing, that an Act of Parliament was ob tained in 1539 for cutting a canal by the side ofthe river, and through the marshes, to Topsham.

The Roman Catholic Rebellion \u2014 Siege of Exeter \u2014 Courage of the Citizens and their Reward \u2014 A prominent rebel. IN the year 1549, Whit Sunday fell upon the 9th of June, and it was on that day that the Act for reforming the then existing religion came in force. In the church of the little moorland town of Sampford Courtenay, the service was conducted on that day in accordance with the newly-made law. By that time, however, the priests had played sad havoc with the consciences and morals of the poor, misguided wor shippers ; and the latter, choosing to obey those men rather than the law, began to murmur loudly at what was taking place in their church. From simple murmuring, they at length burst out into loud expressions of protest, and what was, at first, but a smouldering spark of rebellion, suddenly burst forth into a fierce, fast-spreading flame. Historians have left us no clue sufficient to detect the feelings of the priest of Sampford Courtenay regarding the change of religion, but he was either a respecter or a fearer of the law ; for, the next day, he proceeded to once more read the new liturgy. Thereupon, the storm burst forth in all its violence, every succeeding circumstance tending to increase its fury."], [112, "78 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. Two men in the congregation, a tailor, named William Underhill, and a labourer, named Segar, made their way to where the priest was standing, and demanded of him that he should conduct the services of the church according to the Roman Catholic forms. The priest had not much opportunity for reflecting as to what course he had better adopt, for soon the whole congregation joined in the cry winch had been raised against the \" innovations,\" and the priest, being threatened, was compelled to resume his popish vestments and defer to the demands of the worshippers. With almost incredible rapidity, the news of this local conquest spread throughout the county. The \" common people\" received the intelligence amid manifestations of the greatest joy, and, prompted by the success obtained at Sampford Courtenay, they resolved on the adoption of similar measures in their own churches. In all parts, the greatest excitement prevailed, and very soon, indeed, the whole county was in a state of the most alarming agitation. The magistrates, therefore, began to bestir themselves, and to consider what course they should adopt under the circumstances. Many ideas and suggestions presented themselves, but the \" repre sentatives of the law,\" and \" the dispensers of justice,\" resolved, at length, to seek an interview with the chief among the disaffected people. They succeeded in having a long conference with the principals of the rebellion, but no satisfactory result was arrived at. A rumour was then spread that the magistrates had intrigued with the rebels, for the people (or rather, the peaceably-dis-"], [113, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 79 posed portion of them), could not understand why the rebels were not put down, as they were outnumbered by the magistrates and their attendants. So the dissatisfied people being thus left to their own resources, the re bellion grew on to serious proportions. At length, news of what was taking place in Devonshire was borne to the Government, and they decided to send down Sir Peter Carew and his brother, Sir Gawen, their mission being to endeavour, in conjunction with the magistrates, to quiet the people by means of persuasion, failing which, it was resolved to take more severe steps. Lord Russel, who was afterwards created Earl of Bedford, was subsequently sent down, charged with a similar task. When the two Carews arrived in the city of Exeter, they had an interview with Sir Peter Courtenay (the Sheriff), and the magistrates of the County; and, after the meeting, they set out with their followers in the direction of Crediton, for in that place a large number of the disaffected had assembled. The object of their journey was to try whether reasoning and persuasion would suffice to induce the rebels to submit. Long before the arrival of the Carews and their band, however, the people at Crediton had been apprised of their approach, and had adopted hasty measures of defence. After experiencing some amount of resistance, the magistrates succeeded in driving the rebels from the town, and they then returned to Exeter. The occurrences at Crediton served only as fuel added to the flames of rebellion. In all parts of the country,"], [114, "80 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. people gathered themselves into defensive bands, and towns and villages were well fortified against attack. At St. Mary's Clist, the disaffection was very great. Though good terms were offered the rebels by the Carews and the magisterial party, they refused to sub mit. Some of the magistrates were taken prisoners, and others allowed themselves to fall into the hands of the rebels, in order that they might, in that way, find an excuse for lending their assistance to a rebellion which they were secretly in favour of. The rest of the party returned to Exeter. In the southern quarter of the city, there is an enclosure known as the Mermaid yard, and there at present stand two large blocks of houses, known as \" Industrial dwellings.\" Into that yard the Carew's and their party \"gallantly rode,\" and, after supper at the inn to which the yard was attached, they diverted themselves with a quarrel regarding the mode of dealing the rebels, whose determi nation was every day becoming of a more serious character. When the Mayor of the city (Mr. John Tuckfield) learnt the state of affairs, he informed the gallant Knights and Squires that Exeter was not sufficiently provisioned for the maintenance of so many men, and that they had better look after their own interests. Having received this piece of information, they there fore resolved to leave the city to its own resources, and made good their escape through the bye-ways. Sir Peter Carew hastened to Sir Hugh Paulet's in Somersetshire, where Lord Russel was at that time"], [115, "81 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. staying. His Lordship directed Sir Peter to hurry to the Government and acquaint them with the whole state of affairs. The Government heard a full rehearsal of the transactions, rebuked Sir Peter for increasing the irritation of the people by his actions at Crediton, and resolved upon once more endeavouring to pacify the disaffected by persuasive means. An offer of pardon was holden out to all who would turn and obey the law, but, instead of listening to that gracious message, the frenzied people merely saw in it a sign of encouragement for their own designs, and they proceeded to carry on their war against law and order more vigorously than ever. They were no longer content to be led by men selected from the lowest classes, but resolved on fighting under leaders who came from the ranks of discontented gentry both in Devonshire and Cornwall. Among these were Sir Thomas Pomeroy, Mr. John Berry, and Mr. Coffin, of Devonshire ; and Mr. Humphrey Arundell and Mr. Wrinslade, of Cornwall, all gentleman of high position in their respective counties. By this time, the ranks of the rebels were considerably swollen, the aristocratic commanders and other circum stances having inspired confidence in those who before had felt it discreet to hold aloof. It was resolved, at length, to lay siege to Exeter. The rebels well knew that many of the citizens held opinions in their favour ; and, before taking any further steps, they sent to the Mayor, demanding that he and the inhabitants should join the rebellion, and give the insurgents an entry into the place. 1="], [116, "82 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. The Mayor immediately called his brother magistrates together, and a consultation was held concerning this most important matter. Among the magistrates there were many who were firmly attached to the Romish faith, but, notwithstanding' that fact, it was decided that a peremptory refusal of the rebels' demands should be given. Finding that their efforts to win over the city to their side were unavailing, the insurgents on the 2nd of July, 1549, came to the walls of the city with a force of two thousand men. A proclamation was issued, saying that if the inhabitants of Exeter would not deliver up their city and join the rebels' ranks, the latter would by force enter and spoil it. But the magistrates and the loyal citizens turned a deaf ear to these demands, and the siege thereupon commenced. The people of Exeter worked with might and main to properly fortify their City, whilst the enemy com menced their programme of annoyances by cutting off the means of communication, and rendering it impossible for food to be conveyed to the besieged. Having planted their cannon against the walls, they broke down the conduit pipes and burned the gates. After the latter work of destruction, the citizens had more serviceable barriers constructed inside, in front of which fires were kept burning every night. The rebels had hoped by de stroying the conduit pipes to cut off the water supply; but, as Exeter was situated on a hill and full of copious springs, the design was a futile one. The enemy (as we must designate the rebels) kept a strict watch on the houses inside the City walls); and if any persons were"], [117, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 83 bold or indiscreet enough to shew themselves at the windows, shots were fired, many being so surely aimed that in a large number of cases severe injury or death resulted. Finding this state of things to exist, bodies of the citizens made frequent sallies, and, by burning down the houses outside the walls, drove the enemy from a position which up to that time they had occu pied with great advantage to themselves. It was also unsafe to walk in some of the streets, as they were within range ofthe enemy's cannon ; but the inhabitants succeeded in putting a stop to that risk^by the raising of large mounds for the protection of exposed quarters. The alarm and excitement which prevailed in the City was one day considerably increased upon a dis covery that the rebels had undermined the walls at West Gate, beneath which they had stored barrels of powder and other combustibles. On a pre-arranged night, at a certain signal, it was intended by the enemy to fire the mine and blow up the walls ; whereupon, they would have rushed in and taken possession of the City. However, their design was discovered, and that, too, in a most remarkable manner. A man named John Newcombe, who came from Teignmouth, was staying in Exeter at that time, and whilst walking in the Western Quarter one day, he heard noises which led him to suspect that the place was being undermined. Newcombe, it happened, had a good friend in the City, in the person of Mr. Alderman Hurst, and to him he confided the secret of his suspicions. The result was that per-"], [118, "84 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. mission was given him to work out a plot for frustrating the enemy's designs. He went about his very important task in a most careful way, his first step being to place upon the ground a pan of water, and, by shifting it about from place to place, he discovered, by the shaking of the contents, the precise spot at which the rebels were at work. His next man\u0153uvre was to dig a countermine, and, at last, he came so near the enemy's excavation as to be able to peer down into it. Newcombe then gave orders for the simultaneous drawing of the wells in all streets having a fall towards the mine which he had dug, and he also directed that every man should have a tub of water ready at his front door. When it was ascertained that all things had been arranged in accord ance with Newcombe's brilliant idea, a signal was given, and the people watched with an anxious curiosity for the sequel. The wells were drawn, and all the vessels of water emptied of their contents at one time, the consequence, of course, being that a huge volume of water rushed down the mine, deluging it and all contained therein ; and, as though Heaven itself was favourable to the plan, at the same moment there was such a downpour of rain, as, had not been experienced for a very long period before ! In this miraculous way was the City of Exeter then delivered out of the hands of the enemy ; and there can be no doubt that the loyal citizens were truly grateful to the man to whose ingenuity they owed their preservation. That temporary defeat did not, however, deter the rebels from their persistent annoyances, which were,"], [119, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 85 nevertheless, insignificant when taken in comparison with the troubles which existed inside the walls. The poor citizens were enduring all the attendant agonies of famine. The scarcity of provisions had driven them to eat bran for bread, whilst horseflesh was the food of the occupants of the gaols. But there existed an evil which far surpassed all these. The ad herents to the Romish faith comprised the greater portion of the citizens, and though many of them were law-abiding people, there were others among them who plotted together for the purpose of yielding up the place to the rebels. The Mayor and chief citizens, whatever religious opinions they might have held, were staunch and loyal, and so wise and forbearing were they in their Goverment, that they succeeded in preventing a surrender. A band of faithful men was organized, and they set themselves the task of guarding the city and preventing the making of plots and surprises ; and, no doubt, all would have gone well enough with them, had not jealousy and discontent prevailed. They had made frequent sallies upon the enemy without the permission of the proper authorities, and, one day, a dispute arose between two of the organization, John Courtenay and Barnard Duffield, on the question as to whether or not it was right that such unauthorised sallies should be made. Duffield was of opinion that it was not wrong to make them, but Courtenay maintained that they were unlawful. The two men were not able to agree, and their dispute was referred to the Mayor, who pronounced the un-"], [120, "86 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. authorized sallies unlawful, and forbade their continuance. Duffield, however, refused to recognise the wisdom of that decree, and as the Mayor would not alter his decision, he behaved so violently, that his Worship, consulting the City's interest, committed him to ward. When the news of Duffield's imprisonment reached the ears of his daughter, she followed her father's ex ample, and became violent, too. Late in the same evening she went in a passion to the house of the Mayor, and demanded that her father should be released. For once, however, susceptible man was proof against the \"passion ate\" tears of beauty, and he refused to accede to her requirements. Thereupon the girl flew into a rage, and rushing wildly at the City's head man, struck him a violent blow in the face, a forcible mode of argument, which, let us hope, is not too often adopted by the fair sex of the present day. News of the outrage speedily spread abroad, and the citizens were in arms, bent on avenging it. They would, no doubt, have carried out their purpose, but the Mayor, for the sake of the City's peace, did not exhibit any indignation that he might have felt, and proceeded to quiet the excited people, bidding them to disperse orderly to their homes. Meanwhile, Lord Russel's forces had been augmented, and after engaging the rebels at Fenniton Bridge (near Honiton), Woodbury Common, St. Mary's Clist, and Clist Heath, in the end utterly vanquishing them, he arrived with his force outside the City, the relief of which he had come to effect. On hearing of the defeat"], [121, "87 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. which the insurgents had sustained at Clist Heath, those of their comrades who had been left to continue the siege of Exeter fled in dismay. The prisoners who had been confined in the churches outside the city were liberated, and hastening to the gates they bade the people be of good cheer, for the days of their suffering would soon be ended \u2014 the hour of their deliverance was at hand. As if in order to verify these glad tidings, early the next morning (it being then the Sixth of August), Lord Russel arrived outside Exeter and drew up his army on ground then called St. John's field, but which is now an important public thoroughfare, and is known as the Barnfield. Well knowing the famishing condition of the people, he sent out parties to scour the country in search of provisions. Welcome as was the sight and taste of food, from which the poor starving creatures had been so long compelled to abstain, it would have been as well for some of them had the feast still been withheld, for so ravenously did they set to work to appease their appetites, that they were siezed with a sudden illness and soon died. The same day as that on which Russel arrived at the City, a melancholy procession filed into the Cathedral. It was the funeral cortege of Sir William Francis (a leader of the Royal forces, who was killed in the march on St. Mary's Clist), whose body had been borne on a litter to Exeter, by way of Topsham. For over a month the citizens had bravely withstood the siege, and their fame was echoed far and wide. The"], [122, "88 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. magistrates commanded the day of Lord Russel's arrival to be devoted to thanksgiving, and, till far on in the present century, the Mayor and Corporation observed the custom of repairing in procession to the grand old Cathedral on every Sixth of August. Unhappily, the rebellion was not yet finally ex tinquished, but the flame was only a vain, flickering one. Lord Russel had now been reinforced by a thousand Welshmen, under Sir William Herbert, and the whole army, which by that time numbered from eight to ten thousand, proceeded to Sampford Courtenay, where the rebels had once more assembled. The town was well fortified, and the disaffected people fought with a splendid, yet hopless, valour \u2014 killing in the strugggle a respected young Welshman, named Ap Owen. At length however, they were overpowered, and vanquished in the very town where the rebellion had had its birth. Those who fell not by the sword fled into the neighbouring county of Somerset, but, being pursued thither by Sir Hugh Paulet and Sir Peter Carew, were for the most part, either slain or taken prisoners. Then was the rebellion utterly crushed, and had Lord Russel permitted things to remain as they were, the onus of most unjustifiable atrocities would not have rested upon him. Under the pretence that he considered the flames of revolt were still smouldering in some places, he sent out his men to spoil the country, and so literally did they obey his orders, sparing neither loyalist nor"], [123, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 89 rebel, that for years the countryside presented a sad and most desolate appearance. The principal leaders of the rebels, Arundell, Winslade, Berry, Coffin, and Holmes, were carried to London, and, after trial, these met their deaths at the hands of the executioner, those of inferior rank being put to death in Exeter. As for the common people who had suffered themselves to be so deluded, they were pardoned and dismissed to their homes, having, at last, learnt the folly of their behaviour, and feeling thankful for the mercy which had been shown them. Sir Thomas Pomeroy, whose family had been one of the most esteemed and opulent in Devonshire, succeeded in saving his head at a great price, yielding up his lands and beautiful castle at Berry, near Totnes, to Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, the Lord Protector. Among the more prominent persons who suffered for taking part in the rebellion was the parish priest of St. Thomas, Exeter, who was executed in his popish robes, and hung on chains on the tower of his own church, where his body remained hanging until the accession of Queen Mary, when the Roman Catholic religion was once more restored. The man who suffered such an ignominious death had many good qualities, and such influence had he over the rebels under the walls during the siege, that on one occasion he prevented them from carrying out a plot to fire the City. The King, in order to shew his admiration for the heroic manner in which the citizens had endured the siege, tendered them his personal thanks, and, in addi-"], [124, "90 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. tion to other gracious acts, he gave back to them the valuable manor of Exe Island, a right of which they had been deprived ever since the Norman Conquest. Exe Island is now inhabitated by some of the poorest classes of Exonians, and they become incredulous when told of the great value of the \" Island\" at the times of which we have been writing. Thus ends our story of the siege of Exeter ; and the loyalty and heroism of its inhabitants, to whom might well have been applied the phrase \" Well done, good and faithful servants.\""], [125, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 91 CHAPTER XVI.

She was a resident of Launces ton, in Cornwall, but received such cruel treatment at the hands of her husband and children (who were Roman Catholics), that she was constrained to leave her home and wander up and down the country. On returning, she was betrayed by her own kindred in the hands of the Romish bigots. Dr. Turberville, Bishop of Exeter, had her cast into his prison, and as, upon examination, she steadfastly refused to believe in the real presence in the sacrament, she was ordered to be burnt alive. Subse quent bribes of money failed to shake her faith, and on the 15th of August, 1557, she suffered an agonising death at a stake erected on Southernhay.

One of her first steps in connection with Exeter was to remove the Popish Bishop Turber ville from his See ; and William Alleigh was appointed in his stead. The latter, however, was not long in getting at loggerheads with the Mayor. The worthy prelate had obtained a commission to act as Justice of the Peace within the limits of the City. The Mayor, who probably feared the results of clerical interference, contended that the pretensions of the Bishop were an infringement of the citizens' chartered rights ; and on an appeal to the Queen this contention was held good, and the Bishop had to give way. All the rights and privileges of the City her Majesty upheld, and as a recognition of the loyal aid which the citizens had given her (voluntarily fitting out and maintaining three ships and crews) on the occasion of the Spanish invasion, she sent them a letter of thanks, and granted them the honour of bearing the motto Semper Fidelis* under the City arms, for ever. She gave great encouragement to the City's commerce, adventuring large sums in business speculations (on one occasion as much as ,\u00a3\"20,000), although, Dr. Oliver remarks, she was \" keen enough in looking after the returning profits.\" To counteract the effect of mendicity which was so prevalent at this period, the Queen ordered houses of correction to be built, and one was erected in this City by the voluntary contributions of the citizens ; and the Canal had been so far improved at this time that vessels of fifteen or sixteen tons burthen were enabled to come up to the quay from Topsham with merchandize. * \"Ever Faithful.\""], [127, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 93 But there is a dark as well as a bright side to our account of the City in this period. In the latter part of 1568, a flood, occasioned by a sudden thaw, did much damage in a neighbourhood of the river, Head Weir (then Calabear Weir) being totally destroyed, whilst other weirs, and several bridges, were seriously damaged. The following year the plague again visited the City, and was of such a virulent character that the principal inhabi tants fled from the place; and in 1586, a terrible sickness broke out at the assizes. The disease was brought from the Prison (which at that time was in a shocking sanitary condition) into the court. The mortality which followed was alarming, and the judge (Sergeant Flowerby), several magistrates, eleven jurymen, many constables, and a number of other persons who attended the court, suc cumbed to the disorder. The outbreak was supposed to have originated from some Portuguese seamen, whose ship (laden with fish from Newfoundland) had been taken by Sir Bernard Drake. The whole of the crew (38 in number) were thrown into prison, where they were neglected in a shocking manner. Emaciated by sickness, want, and the effects of confinement in a filthy dungeon, they had to be carried to the court on hand-barrows. Their condition awoke such humanity as was left in the authorities, and those who survived were taken care of, and in due time sent back to Portugal. Not only were the poor harassed by such sickness,* but want also ; for it is recorded that in 1593 there was * The plague in a modified form broke out again in 1589."], [128, "94 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. such a scarcity of corn that the Mayor and Chamber granted a sum of money for the erection of a granary, in order that there might be a supply of this commodity in case of a like calamity in the future. The reign was marked by the confirmation of an ancient custom, by which a fine of 20s. was inflicted on every person whose house chanced to be the scene of a conflagration ; and a penalty of 6/8 on every indi vidual whose chimney was on fire. A penalty for the latter offence is still exacted in Exeter ; and there is at the present time a widely expressed feeling, that, if the former custom is not revived, there should at least be some sort of enquiry into the origin of the fires which are so frequently occurring in the City. We will draw our remarks concerning the reign of the \"good Queen Bess\"* to a close, by relating what modern journals would describe in a bold head-line as a \" Scene in Court,\" in the year 1602. Several young gentleman (who, being educated by Sir William Courtenay's chap lain, resided at Powderham Castle), were arraigned at the Assizes on the charge of having assaulted, and robbed on the highroad, several persons who were going to Exeter market. Sir William Courtenay appeared at the Court and urged on behalf of the delinquents that what they had done was \" by way ot a frolic.\" The judge, however, declined to accept an excuse of this sort, and very properly decided that the law should take its * In this reign (A.D. 1 571), it may be mentioned incidentally, Agnes James was burnt on Southernhay for poisoning her husband."], [129, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 95 course. On hearing this decision, Sir William Courtenay flew into a passion, and, putting his hand on his sword, threatened to make the judge's shirt \" as red as his scarlet gown.\" Fearing the consequences of this outrage on the Queen's representative, however, Courtenay rode immediately to London, and, falling at the feet of Her Majesty, craved pardon for the offence he had committed. The Queen refused, and ordered him in custody; but her regard for the culprit's family subsequently induced her to release him. The reign of King James I. will not detain us long, for the events of that period were not numerous. Holloway, a deep and dangerous road outside Southgate, was filled up, levelled and paved in 1606 ; the following year the price of corn was so high that contributions were made for the purchase of quantities of that commodity from abroad; in 161 1, Thomas Tooker, the sword bearer, was executed at Heavitree gallows, for wife murder ; the subsequent year saw the conversion of the ancient counterscarp of the Castle into the Northernhay Walk ; in 1622, the chamber purchased the then lately dissolved Priory of St. John, and converted it (by charter) into a hospital for poor men. It is gratifying to be able to record that during this reign the trade of the city (especially the woollen) was in a prosperous state. The commerce, which had been pre viously chiefly confined to France and Germany, was now extended to Italy, Turkey, and other parts of the East, and by this industry a good many fortunes were made."], [130, "96 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. Many of the inhabitants of Exeter took part in the colonization of America, and, in memory of their native City, they built a town there, and called it Exeter."], [131, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 97 CHAPTER XVII. The Civil War \u2014 Exeter under Parliament rule \u2014 Desecration of the Cathedral and Parish Churches \u2014 Sufferings of the Clergy \u2014 Execu- tions of Royalists. mHE reign of Charles I. did not bring much good fortune to Exeter. It opened with a plague which created much havoc among the inhabitants, and necessitated the erection of a Pest house in St. Sidwell's (near Lion's Holt) ; and this disaster was followed by the disturbing influences of the Civil War. Generally speaking, the inhabitants were Royalists, and it was therefore much against their will that the Earl of Bedford, who had been appointed Lord- Lieutenant of the county by the Parliament, placed the City in a state of defensive opposition to the King. This, however, was done, the Earl of Stamford being appointed the Governor. In a conflict in which the latter took part at Stratton, in Cornwall, the Parliamentarians were defeated, and the Earl, with a goodly number of followers, fled back to Exeter. In due course, the King's forces, under Prince Maurice, arrived outside Exeter, and laid a close siege to it. The Earl of Warwick was ordered by the Parliament to attempt its relief and with a view to alluring the Royal G"], [132, "98 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. forces from the City, he pretended to attempt to land at various places on the coast. This plan did not answer, however, and on entering the Exe his party lost three ships, which became stranded, owing to the unlooked-for recession of the tide. Stamford prolonged the siege of Exeter in the hope of succour, but he was, at length, obliged to surrender, after a blockade of eight months and nineteen days. Sir John Berkeley was appointed by the Prince, Governor in his stead. Exeter was after this so pronounced in its loyalty to the King that he resolved on trusting the Queen, whom the Parliamentarians were molesting, to the care of the inhabitants. On the ist of May, 1644, she reached the City, -and kept her court at Bedford House, where, on Sunday morning, June 16th, she was delivered of a Princess, afterwards baptized in the name of Henrietta. The fact that the Earl of Essex was making rapid advances towards Devonshire (he arrived at Tiverton on the 5th of July), suggested to the Queen the ex pediency of getting further out of the reach of her persecutors. Accordingly she secretly left the City about the end of June, under the protection of Prince Maurice, escaping to Le Conquest, in a Flemish ship, which sailed from Falmouth. On the 26th of July, Charles reached Exeter from Honiton, he having come in search of the Earl of Essex. The citizens loyally received him, voting him \u00a3\"ioo to the Prince Charles, 20 marks to the King's servants, and 20 nobles to the servants of the Prince. His Majesty visited the infant Princess at Bedford House;"], [133, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 99 knighted the Mayor in recognition of his loyalty ; held a military council, at which it was resolved to follow Essex into Cornwall, and proceeded the following day either to Bradninch or Crediton. The campaign in Cornwall was successful from the Royalist point of view ; and on the 17th September the King was again in Exeter, staying for a short period at Bedford House. The dawning of the year 1645 saw a great change come over the aspect of affairs. The sun of the Royalists had shone brightly in the political horizon, but it was destined to set now. Victory after victory had rewarded the erst-while vanquished Parliamentarians ; and on the 31st March, 1646 (having previously secured all ap proaches towards Exeter), Sir Thomas Fairfax appeared before the City. A command to surrender was sent to Berkeley the Governor. Berkeley summoned the City Council, and it was decided after a grave deliberation that resistance was useless. An answer was returned to Lord Fairfax, that the Governor was prepared to open negotiations. These commenced at Poltimore, the seat of Sir John Bampfield, on Friday, the 3rd April, they were concluded on the Thursday following, and on Monday, the 13th, Exeter was in the hands of the Parliament troops. The ensuing condition of the City appears to have been far from tranquil, and pitiful stories are told of the sufferings endured by certain sections of the inhabitants. The clergy especially were very hardly used, and the scornful and cruel manner in which some of them were allowed to be treated is without justification, and indi-"], [134, "100 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. cated a spirit of intolerance which we should hardly have expected from a party originally inspired by such high motives as those of the Parliament. The whole of the Cathedral clergy and thirteen of the parochial ministers were turned out of their livings ; the Cathedral was divided into places of Worship, East Peter's and West Peter's, and the service of the Directory was ordered to be performed in but four parish churches, viz., St. Mary Majors, St. Petrocks, St. Mary Arches, and St. Edmund's on the Bridge. The remaining thirteen, being condemned as useless, were announced for sale by the crier,* and it was stipulated that the purchasers should take down the towers \" clean to the' roof,\" and the buildings were to be converted into either schools or burying places. The troops set about their work of ransacking and defacing the Cathedral in a shocking manner. The authorities interdicted service in the building, converted it into a storehouse for ammunition, and used it as they would an ale-house. The windows were smashed, the monuments in the sacred edifice mutilated, and the organ broken down. Taking the pipes of that instrument, people paraded the streets and piped in a \" scornful * The thirteen churches referred to were, St. Stephen's, St. Kerrian's, St. Martin's, St. George's, St. Lawrence's, All Hallow's (Goldsmith Street), St. Pancras, All Hallow's-on-the-Wall (which was unroofed), Trinity, St. Mary Steps, St. John's, Bow, St. Paul's, and St. Olave's.

Despite the tenacity with which the City had held out against the Parliament, the Corporation in course of time became agreeable to the views of the latter, for they decided to solemnize the anniversary day of the surrender of Exeter (April 13th) with a public thanksgiving. Actuated by a politic spirit (for which we cannot reasonably blame them), the City authorities seem to have endeavoured to promote peace by adherence to whichever party (Parliament or King) was for the time being in the ascendancy. Thus, on the 10th of January, 1644, \u00a3100 was voted to Earl of Stamford (the Parlia mentarian Governor), and he was also the recipient of another sum of in the following July, it being given * Vide Dr. Bruno Ryve's account."], [136, "102 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. as a testimony of the City's regard for him. When the tables were turned on the Parliamentarians, and the Loyalists had it all their own way in Exeter, we find Sir John Berkeley being presented with the freedom of the City and /500, the latter to be divided between himself and Prince Maurice. This shifty policy was not honest perhaps, but it was warranted by the exigencies of those turbulent times. It is not surprising that the history of the City at this period is comparatively barren of events other than those already recorded, for it is to be expected that progress and prosperity had received a rude shock. The establishment of the Commonwealth did not allay the strong party feeling which existed, and which was shewn in Richard Crossing, refusing to take the oath as Mayor in 1649, other officers having declined to take the oath prescribed by the Parliament. James Gould, the Mayor in 1648, had refused to proclaim the assumed Government. The short-sighted policy of the Royalists which led to the insurrection in Wiltshire in March, 1655, made Exeter the scene of many executions. The Royalists retreated into Devonshire ; and being overpowed in a skirmish at Southmolton, were brought prisoners to Exeter. Their trial commenced on the 18th April, 1655, and on the 23rd, twenty-six were convicted of high treason. John Penruddock and Hugh Grove (Esquires), were beheaded in the Castle yard, and several were hanged at Heavitree.

At the period with which we have been dealing in this chapter, much trouble was caused along the western coast, and great injury was sustained by the merchants of Exeter, in consequences of the ravages committed by Turkish pirates. Among other disasters, the Rose Garden, a Topsham barque, laden with goods belonging to Exeter merchants, was, with its crew, carried off by the pirates ; and our authority* adds : \u2014 \" A ship was taken by the Turkish pirates within three leagues of Dartmouth. loss was sustained by Exeter, besides the loss of the ship and seamen.\" * Roberts's History ofthe Southern Coast."], [138, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 104 CHAPTER XVIII.

He was the second son of Sir Thomas Monk, of Potheridge, Knight, his mother being a daughter of Sir George Smyth, of Exeter, who was Mayor in 1607. Charles rewarded Monk for the part he had played in placing him on the throne by creating him Duke of Albermarle, Earl of Torrington, Baron Monk, of Potheridge, Beauchamp and Heys, and Knight of the Garter. Locally, he was honoured with the freedom of the City, and he was also elected High Steward of the same. An interesting story concerning this illustrious soldier is told \u2014 to the effect that, having publicly thrashed the County Sheriff for arresting his father for debt in the presence of a large number of gentlemen at the Castle, he was obliged to fly, in order to avoid arrest. To elude his pursuers, he went as a common sailor on board one of the King's ships. Here he distinguished himself by his bravery and good behaviour, and the first upward step in his career was his promotion to a Lieutenancy"], [139, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 105 The ceremony of proclaiming Charles II. in Exeter was an elaborate one. It was proclaimed from the usual places, viz., the Guildhall, the Little Conduit, in the Cathedral Yard, the Serge Market, at the Great Conduit, and at St. John's Bow. The procession -was composed of the Mayor, Aldermen, Members of the Common Council, the Incorporated Companies (preceded by their beadles and banners), the Herald at Arms, mounted, surrounded by constables, and attended by a troop of horse ; the City trained bands followed (armed) and there was a mighty concourse of people. Bells clanged from the towers, claret flowed from the Conduits, and the sound of cannon and musketry proceeded from the Castle. The populace were enthusiastic and joyous \u2014 some say at the thought of being delivered from anarchy and confusion to a settled form of government, but others ascribe the excitement to the attractions of the occasion, attractions such as will always excite and interest a large concourse of people. On the 2 ist of May, the Corporation voted His Majesty a loyal address ; and on the 25th ofthe following month, it was decided that a piece of plate, worth nearly should be presented to him. On the Queen returning to England, she was presented with plate to the value of as a token of the citizens' delight at her safe arrival. Episcopacy was restored with the monarchy. Dr. John Gauden (the reputed author of the Icon Basilike), was appointed to the See of Exeter, a grand reception being accorded him on his first entry to the City."], [140, "106 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. In this reign the persecutions of the Dissenting Mini ters took place, and under the Conventicles Act, and other harsh regulations, they endured much distress and suffering. In Exeter, numbers of the clergy were ejected, and many distressing stories are told of the trials they had to undergo. The other items of local interest in this reign, are rather numerous. The year 1664 saw the restoration of the Northernhay Walk, which had been ruined during the Civil Wars ; the consecration of Southernhay Burial Ground (situated at the bottom of Southernhay, opposite the Hospital), and its dedication to the Holy Trinity, by Bishop Ward. The King's arms which had been removed from the entrance to the canal during the Commonwealth was restored ; and the old lines and outworks to the walls on Southernhay were levelled and laid out in walks. A great fire, resulting in the deaths of Thomas Hayne, his wife, and niece (seventeen years of age), occurred in 1671 in a dwelling outside Westgate ; in 1673, a Par* \u00b0f *ne City wall, near the Southernhay burying ground (90 feet long and 30 feet high) fell down in the night ; and on the morning of December 29th, in the following year, the house of one Richard Jewell, of St. Sidwell's collapsed, killing his wife and grandchild. Several works for the benefit of the City were executed, in addition to those already mentioned. In 1673, St. Sidwell's (from Eastgate to St. Anne's Chapel) was newly paved, at the expense of the Dean and Chapter, the Lords of the Manor ; in the same year a granary was"], [141, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 107 erected, from whence the poor could obtain cheap wheat, that commodity being then very expensive ; the navigation of the river was improved, the Quay was levelled and surrounded by a strong wall, and a new Custom House was built, in 1675, the works costing upwards of \u00a3\"3000. In 1681, the 4th Regiment of Foot was raised to reinforce the garrison at Tangiers, which had been besieged by the Moors of Barbary. Evidence of the gross superstition of the age was shewn in 1682, in a trial which took place at the Summer Assizes, at which three old women (named Temperance Lloyd, Mary Trembles, and Susannah Edwards) were tried and convicted of witchcraft. The evidence against them was strengthened by confessions, which it was customary to draw from these unfortunate beings by means of torture ; and they were accordingly handed over to the hangman. They met their ignominious fate at Heavitree, on August 25th, 1682. They were natives of Bideford, and the remarkable circumstances of the case have supplied food for comment by Sir Walter Scott, in his interesting letters on \" Demonology and Witch craft.\" We must not close this Chapter without mentioning that in 1670, Charles II. visited Exeter on his return from Plymouth, where he had been to view the Citadel, erected to overawe the inhabitants of that town."], [142, "108 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER.

On the nth of June, 1685, the Duke of Monmouth landed at Lyme, and within a short time he found him self at the head of 6,000 men. With this force at his disposal, he marched, four days after his landing, to Ax minster. He took possession of the town and fortified the avenues. The King's troops, 4,000 strong, under the Duke of Albermarle, were marching to Axminster, from Exeter, but had to beat a retreat back to the latter place. The defeat of Monmouth at Sedgmoor, near Bridge water, and his subsequent ignominious death, are facts well-known to every reader of history. The sequel was one terrible in its details. That inhuman monster Lord Chief"], [143, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 109 Justice Jeffries, accompanied by a fellow barbarian, Colonel Kirk, came into the West to try the followers ofthe unhappy Monmouth. Over 500 persons were found guilty of treason, and of the 239 who were executed, as many as 80 met their fates in Exeter, their mangled remains being allowed to hang from the trees in the public roads, to the disgust and alarm of passers by. Three years later, however, friends of the Protestant Religion had occasion for rejoicing and hope of better times. On the 5th of November, 1688, the Prince of Orange landed at Brixham, from a ship flying a flag on which was inscribed : \" The Protestant Religion and Liberties of England \u2014 I will maintain it.\" The Prince's army consisted of 30,000 men ; and their baggage, ammu nition, and stores were sent, by water, to Topsham, and thence to Exeter. The forces were landed on a Tuesday, and the following day Capt. Hicks, with a party of horse, came to Exeter, to find large numbers of men ready to enlist in the Prince's service. For re fusing to give his authority for his action, the Mayor committed the Captain to prison, but the people would not permit him to be carried away. He was, therefore, allowed to remain in the Hall in charge of two constables, and his wants were properly attended to. Lord Mor daunt and Dr. Burnett (the Prince's Chaplain) came to to Exeter, with four troops of horse. On arriving at the West Gate they found it shut, but the Porter was commanded to open it on pain of death, and he was directed to keep it open under a similar penalty. The first work of Lord Mordaunt was to release Capt."], [144, "110 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. Hicks, and after that, in the afternoon, his Lordship and Dr. Burnett waited on the Mayor, requesting his Worship to meet the Prince at the gate and govern the City under him. This the Mayor refused, on the plea that he had sworn allegiance to the King. The whole of the follow ing day (Thursday) the soldiers continued to pour into the city, which was in a state of great excitement, and on the Friday the Prince made his public entry in a style of immense grandeur. At the head of the pageantry was the Earl of Macclesfield, with two hundred horsemen, the greater number of whom were English gentlemen, richly accoutred and mounted on Flanders steeds, with head pieces and body armour. They were attended by two hundred blacks from the plantations of the Nether lands in America, who wore embroidered caps, lined with fur, and plumes of feathers, and were followed by two hundred Finlanders in bear skins, with black armour and broad swords. Next came fifty gentlemen, and the same number of pages, to attend and support the Prince's Banner, on which were the words : \" God and the Protestant Religion.\" The Prince himself, on a white charger, came next \u2014 in complete armour highly wrought, and with a plume of white feathers in his helmet. Forty-two running footmen were by his side, and two hundred gentlemen and pages, mounted, followed. After these came the chief officer, with six hundred guards, completely armed; and the rest of the army brought up the rear. The Prince, who was received with manifestations of joy on the part of the citizens, took up his quarters at"], [145, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 111 the Deanery, and after refreshing himself he attended divine service at the Cathedral, Dr. Burnett subsequently reading the Prince's proclamation. On the Sunday the Prince's Chaplain preached again at the Cathedral. At first his Highness did not find warm supporters of his cause in the magistrates and clergy of the City, who were doubtless intimidated by remembrances of the fate which had overtaken Monmouth's adherents. Lamplough, the Bishop of Exeter, on hearing of the Prince's approach, had fled with intelligence thereof to the King. For this service he was rewarded by being created Archbishop of York. The Dean, and most of the resident Clergy, followed his example in taking flight, and at first only Alderman Tuthill and one other member of the Corpor ation declared in the Prince's favour. The aspect of affairs, however, subsequently became more encouraging, and the Prince had the satisfaction of finding numbers of distinguished persons in the county flocking to his standard. The Prince left Exeter on the 21st, having stationed a small garrison in the City under Sir Edward Seymour, whom he had created governor. In due course his Highness reached London, and his elevation to the Throne (with his consort Mary) was an event which in Exeter, as well as other parts of the country, drew forth joyous demonstrations. Once more wine ran from the Conduits, and at night the fine old City was grandly illuminated.* \u2022 The King and Queen were proclaimed in Exeter on the Friday follow- ing the Coronation."], [146, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 112 Evidence of James's arbitrary conduct had been found in his demand to the City to surrender its Charter. Before his abdication, however, he sought to ingratiate himself into the favour of his subjects by issuing a proclamation for restoring Charters to cities and towns, except those who had voluntarily surrendered their rights. The City of Exeter was in the latter category, but on the 5th of November its Charter was restored. On the outbreak of the rebellion in favour of James in Ireland, a regiment of foot was received in Exeter for King William's service. They were commanded by gentlemen of the City and neighbourhood, and in the encounter with the Irish they acquitted themselves bravely, and gave evidence of their earnestness in the cause of the Protestant Religion, which the Prince had so successfully championed. According to the account of Moses Pitts, a bookseller, who about this period undertook an investigation of the condition of the prisons in the country, the Devon County gaol, which is said to have been situated at Stoke, was in a very wretched state. It appeared that three or four beds were placed in a chamber of inadequate size, and \" three persons in every narrow bed,\" so that they had \" not room to turn themselves.\" Each person had to pay two shillings and sixpence per week, so that these chambers were twice as dear as any in the King's Bench or Fleet. There was no drink allowed but \" ale, of six, eight, and ten days old,\" and, the Chronicler adds, \" the gaoler sells to the tapster for forty-three shillings per hogshead, and the tapster will sell little more than a pint"], [147, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 113 for twopence, which we can have stronger from abroad for one penny ; but the prisoners dare not send for it if the keeper lie in the way, nor have it brought in at the door, but put into them at the window in small quantities.\" Several deaths from want had occurred, and persons were confined in irons for trifling offences. The keeper was a butcher by trade ; he kept twenty or thirty pigs in a court within twenty feet of the kitchen door, and the place generally was in a dangerously filthy condition. During this reign the trade of the City greatly increased, woollen and other goods being exported to all parts of the world ; and of the six new mints which were set up in the country, in the year 1696 one was established in Exeter, in a part of Hele's Hospital, Mary Arches Lane (now Street). Here a large quantity of silver coins were turned out, the distinguishing feature of them being a letter E, placed under the bust. Locally, the reign of Queen Anne is distinguished by the erection of a new (the present) Workhouse; and the foundation of charity schools, that for girls being situated in part of the Blue Maid's Hospital in Mary Arches Lane. These schools were built and supported by voluntary contributions (with aid from the City funds), and were found to be of immense benefit to the poorer classes of children. The projector of this excellent scheme was Dr. Blackall (the Bishop of the Diocese). The rejoicings attendant on the Coronation of George I. on October 20th, 1714, were interrupted by riots, which arose in different parts of the country ; and, but H"], [148, "114 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. for the promptitude of the magistrates, the similar disorder would have arisen in Exeter. The commotions occasioned by the tactics pursued by the Jacobites were the cause of great disquietude in Exeter; and when the rebellion broke out in the North in favour of the Pretender, an association for supporting King George was formed in this City, and it was called the Constitutional Society. By this means, the hands of the Protestant party were strengthened, and the intended Western insurrection was prevented. The Parliament had attainted the Duke of Ormond, Lord High Steward of Exeter, and he being deprived of this office, it was accepted by George, Prince of Wales. A patent for this purpose was granted with the common seal of the City, it being presented to his Royal Highness by the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, Sir Peter King, who was the son of a respectable Exeter grocer. Incidentally mentioning the extremely severe winter of 1715-16, when the Exe was frozen over, business stopped, and many people frozen to death, we come to the reign of George II. In the year 1741, an im portant step was taken in the laying of the first stone of the Devon and Exeter Hospital, the founder of which was John Tuckfield, one of the representatives of the City, who virtually gave the land on which the Hospital was built.* This valuable institution, which has been found of the greatest possible benefit, not only to the inhabitants of Exeter, but to people in all parts of the County, is supported by public charity, and somewhat * The land was only formally purchased of Tuckfield."], [149, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 115 recently a system for augmenting its funds has been introduced in the shape of \" Hospital Saturday,\" the successful working of which our readers are aware. In connection with this institution (the Hospital), it may be stated that an Act was passed in 1752, which provided for the delivering up to surgeons of Hospitals, etc., of the bodies of executed persons. A gentleman named Huish, who was possessed of some fortune, but had not turned out well, was the first executed in this neighbourhood under the Act. He was charged with poisoning his father, and beating his mother to death. Of the first charge he was acquitted, but being found guilty of the second, he was sentenced to death. The execution took place at Heavitree gallows, and his body was afterwards sent to the Devon and Exeter Hospital, for the use of the surgeons. The imposition of the cider tax in the reign of George III. (soon after the proclamation of peace with France) occasioned great discontent in Exeter. On the day of thanksgiving for peace, the members of the Chamber refused to accompany the Mayor to the Cathedral, and during the time of divine service, a procession paraded the streets, the most conspicuous feature of it being an apple tree and empty hogshead, decorated with black ribbons, and labels bearing the inscription : \" Excise, the First Fruits of Peace.\" Many strongly-worded treatises on the subject cf the tax were written, in cluding one by the Town Clerk of Exeter, Mr. Benjamin Heath; and a petition for the repeal of the imposition was sent from this City, signed by the Mayor, the members"], [150, "116 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. of the Chamber, and a large number of influential citizens. So strong was the feeling on the subject, that when Dr. Frederick Keppel, the Bishop of the Diocese, came down into Exeter \u2014 it having been reported that he voted for the cider tax \u2014 he met a far from cordial reception from the mob, a member of whom threw an apple at his Lordship's head. This was in 1765, but the following year the obnoxious tax was repealed, much to the delight of the people of Exeter. The City was the scene of another disturbance in the year 1769. On the 19th of July, the Duke of Bedford (Lord Lieutenant of the County) paid a visit to Exeter, but was most unfavourably received by the populace, the reason of their unfriendly bearing being a report that he had consented to a secret article in the late treaty of peace, allowing the French to import their silks and other manufactures into this Kingdom. On leaving the Guildhall \u2014 where he had been to receive the freedom of the City \u2014 he was hissed by the mob, whose demeanour was so threatening that he had to be conducted to Bamfylde House by the Mayor and his officers. On the Duke proceeding to the Castle, he was again molested. Subsequently, he drove to the Cathedral, where the Bishop, Clergy and choir were waiting to receive him, but on alighting from his carriage he was set on in a violent manner by the mob. With difficulty his Grace got into the Choir, and eventually managed to escape by a back way into the Bishop's place. There he remained until the evening, when the mob gradually dispersed."], [151, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 117 In the year 1789, King George III* visited Exeter, with Queen Charlotte, and a part of the Royal family, his Majesty being on a tour through the Western Counties. No expense was spared by the Chamber, and the City generally, to make the reception of the Royal Party a fitting one. Over three hundred of the principal citizens were sworn in as special constables, and the streets from the end of Paris Street to Broadgate were \"railed in and gravelled over.\" The Guildhall was decorated with variegated lamps and festoons of artificial flowers, and a grand chair of state was erected, in expectation of the King honouring the City by a visit to the ancient hall. On the afternoon of the 13th of August, his Majesty, with the Queen and three of the Princesses, was met at the bottom of Paris Street by a party of constables, who con ducted them into the City ; and at St. John's Hospital, the Royal Party were received by the Mayor, Chamber, Trade Corporations in liveries, etc. Addresses of loyalty were delivered, for which his Majesty returned thanks, and the party subsequently adjourned to the Deanery, over which a regiment of Dragoons mounted guard. There were fireworks, bonfires, and so on in the night, and the City was prettily illuminated. During his stay, the King visited the Cathedral, but not the Guildhall, as he thought it would give umbrage to other towns through which he passed. After staying two nights, the Royal visitors left Exeter for Saltram, near Plymouth. There they stayed for a fortnight, and on their return (en route for Weymouth), they spent another night at * King George III. renewed the City's charter in 1770."], [152, "118 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. the Deanery.

Wesley visits Exeter and preaches in St. Mary Arches Church \u2014 Founda- tion and progress of Wesleyan Methodism in the City \u2014 Persecutions futile. %^ 'HOSE of our readers who happen to be followers \\ilr of John Wesley will look upon the winter of 1739 as a red letter period in the religious history of the City, for from that winter dates the birth of Wes leyan Methodism here. On Sunday, the 25th of November in that 3'ear, John Wesley accepted an invitation to preach in Exeter, and the Church of St. Mary Arches was set apart for his use, at the morning and afternoon service. In the morning, he preached a powerful sermon from Romans, xiv. 17 ; but the discourse was not of a character to suit the Rector (the Rev. Robert Wight), who withdrew the consent he had given for the after noon service. He told Mr. Wesley that he believed that all he said was true, and that it was the doctrine of the Church of England. But it was not guarded ; it was dangerous, and might \" lead people into enthu siasm or despair.\" Nearly four years later than this, the cause was revived in Exeter by Charles Wesley (the author of the celebrated Wesleyan melodies), who preached in the open air. The spot selected was most probably the Castle Yard ; and"], [159, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 125 here, on Sunday, August 28th, 1743, John Wesley addressed an enormous congregation in the Castle Yard. The scene was a highly impressive one, and the pic turesque element was to be found in the grand surround ings of the old Castle. At the close of the service in the Castle Yard, Wesley went to the Gaol to visit a clergyman lying under sentence of death, and he prayed and conversed with a lad whom the law had decreed should die upon the morrow. On the 22nd of September, 1743 (and the following morning), Wesley again preached in the Castle Yard, a mighty congregation listening to his discourse. Exeter Wesleyans met rough treatment at the hands of their persecutors two years later, and the following extract from the London Morning Post of May 16th, 1745, will give an idea of the hardships which they endured for the sake of Religion : \u2014 \" In Exeter, the Methodists had a meeting house behind the Guildhall; and on May 6th, the mob gathered at the door and pelted those who entered with potatoes, mud, and dung. On coming out, the congregation were all beaten, without exception ; many were trampled under foot ; many fled without their hats and wigs ; and some without coats or half of them torn to tatters. Some of the women were lamed, and others stripped naked, and rolled most indecently in the kennel, their faces being besmeared with lampblack, flour and dirt. This disgraceful mob consisted of some thousands of cowardly blackguards, and the disturbance was continued till midnight.\""], [160, "126 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. Despite persecution, Wesleyanism in Exeter was not stamped out, and fifteen years later its founder was found once more in Exeter preaching in the open air. This mode of exhortations seemed to draw the largest congre gations, but the services which took place indoors (first of all in the Room behind the Guildhall, and then in an apartment over Northgate) were earnestly conducted. The congregation which listened to Wesley's dis course in '.'the Room\" on Saturday, August 28th, 1762, was not a very large one, and the cause of the slender attendance was attributed to the omission of field preaching. He accordingly adjourned into the open air, and the following morning (Sunday) preached on Southernhay. \" At the Cathedral \" (says Wesley, re ferring to this day) \" we had an useful sermon, and the whole service was performed with great seriousness and decency. Such an organ I never heard or saw before, so large, beautiful, and so finely toned ; and the music of ' Glory be to God in the Highest,' I think, exceeded the ' Messiah ' itself. I was well pleased to partake of the Lord's supper with my old opponent, Bishop Lavington.* O may we sit down together in the kingdom of our Father.\" After this period, Wesley was absent from the City for a long time, and his subsequent journeys to Exeter were * The author of Reminiscences of Methodism in Exeter, to which we are indebted for much information on this subject, assures us that twelve years before, the Bishop had assailed Wesley \"with the coarsest invective,\" and had sought to overwhelm him with every species of misrepresentation."], [161, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 127 but \"flying visits,\" the distinguished evangelist preaching, as a rule, at Exeter and Cullompton on the same day. In his absence, however, the cause made steady progress ; and among the preachers here was Wesley's friend and coadjutor, George Whitfield, who delivered his last sermon at Exeter, in America, on Saturday, September 29th, 1770. Whitfield was a powerful preacher, and some remarkable cases of conversion by his arguments and eloquence are narrated. On one occasion, whilst preaching at Plymouth, \" his magnificent voice, from a great distance, was heard in the Dockyard by some shipwrights, five or six of whom, leaving their work, sallied forth for the purpose of throwing him down from the table on which he stood. Filling their pockets with stones, they hastened to the place where Whitfield, with extended arms, was calling on sinners to flee from the wrath to come ! \" One of them, while aiming a stone, heard the preacher exclaim \" in a voice of thunder,\" \" Thou art the man ! \" He was struck with amazement, listened to the end of the sermon, became a convert, and was afterwards a useful member ofthe sect in a ministerial capacity. This was the Rev. Mr. Tanner, who, after travelling as an Evangelist, finally settled in Exeter, and built the Tabernacle in Rock Lane. On September 9th, 1775, Wesley preached at the \" Ten Ceils,\"* in Preston Street. At this period a gathering had been formed in Exeter, under the leadership of Mr. * A year or two since, the \"Ten Cells,\" a row of old fashioned Almshouses, were pulled down and the inmates removed to new houses, built in Grendon Road."], [162, "128 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. Gidley, Officer of Assize, and thenceforward the cause flourished. In the year 1778. the Chapel in Musgrave's Alley (which we referred to in Chapter XL, and an illustra tion of which will be found opposite this page), was secured for the use of the Wesleyan Methodists. This having been accomplished almost mainly by the exertions of Mr. Gidley, it was known as \" Gidley's Meeting.\" In 1779, Wesley (who was accompanied by Joseph Brad ford), preached in this Chapel, which he described as \"both neat and solemn, and is believed to contain four or five hundred people.\" The author oi Reminiscences of Methodism in Exeter, describes the building in these words : \u2014 \" The arched entrance to the Chapel was on its west side, at the corner nearest the High Street. Being situated over a room used as a warehouse, its floor was reached by a broad stair ; which, turning midway to the left, rose into the middle of the south end. At the top of the stairs there rose two massy pillars of wood, one on each side, adorned with granite carvings These pillars appear to have been intended originally to support a floor, dividing the place into a lower and an upper room, of which there are other indications ; which floor having been removed, and the whole thrown into one, these pillars had been retained for props for the front of the gallery, which was erected at the south end of the Chapel. The pulpit was at the opposite or northern end, and was of goodly size, in which several persons could sit at once without at all incommoding the preacher.\" The body of the Chapel was pewed, and"], [163, "OLD CH APE. L.r MUSGRAVZS AC-LEY."], [164, ""], [165, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 129 the female portion of the congregation sat on the right hand of the preacher, and the males on the left. There were two rows of windows on each side of the chapel ; the lower, were large with stone frames; and the upper, smaller, and partly in the roof, appeared to have been originally the windows of an upper room. Light was supplied from a brass chandelier suspended from the ceiling. \" At a period earlier than my earliest recollec tions,\" says our authority, \"the Chapel had been painted and adorned by a clever artist, Mr. Slade.\" For many years Exeter was only a branch of the Tiverton and Cullompton Circuit ; but in 1808 it was made the head of a Methodist Circuit, which \" has been more prolific of missionaries and ministers than, from its rank in Methodism, would be supposed.\" On March 25th, 1813, the Mint Wesleyan Chapel (built on the site of the Arian Meeting House) was opened ; and, from that date forward, the story of the progress of Methodism in Exeter is highly satisfactory. I"], [166, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 130 CHAPTER XXI. French prisoners in Exeter \u2014 Food riots \u2014 Great destruction of Property in Exeter and St. Thomas \u2014 Military called out. *^-*HE troubles caused by the French during the latter \\Si/ part of the eighteenth century gave the good people of Exeter an opportunity of displaying their loyalty, and, as occasions arose, Volunteer Regiments were raised for service in the cause of King and Country. During the year 1779, no less than 1300 prisoners of French and other nationalities were sent into Exeter from Plymouth, on which place it was thought that the combined fleets of France and Spain purposed making an attack. The only military force in the City at the time was one company of the Hereford Militia. A meeting was therefore called at the Guildhall, at which those who would volunteer for duty were invited to meet on Southernhay in the afternoon, and there enroll themselves and choose their officers. The idea was taken up with so much spirit, that a volunteer force 8000 strong was formed, and the command was entrusted to Mr. John Baring, one of the Parliamentary repre sentatives of the City. On the prisoners arriving at Alphington Cross, whither they had been conducted by a guard of Plymouth"], [167, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 131 Volunteers, under Mr. William Bastard, of Kitley, they were met by two companies ofthe Exeter Volunteers, who escorted them to their places of confinement \u2014 in some houses on the Alphington Causeway, and in the Bride well in St. Thomas. The county authorities had placed the latter at the disposal of the City, which had no suitable place of its own. During the stay of the prisoners in Exeter, the Volunteers did duty over them, and guarded their charges with such efficiency, that not one escaped. On the removal of the prisoners, the Volunteers received a letter of thanks from the King.* The high price of provisions, especially bread, caused much dissatisfaction among the poorer people of the City in 1795. They thought that the evil arose from the \" nefarious practices of the opulent millers,\" and, being incensed with this notion, a mob assembled and proceeded to Belle Marsh Mills, near Chudleigh. They partly demolished the mill, went off with what grain they could lay hands on, and treated the proprietor in a most cowardly manner. A blacksmith, of Drewsteignton, named Campion, was apprehended as ringleader, and being convicted after trial, he was condemned to die near the spot where the crime was committed. The ceremony of putting the unfortunate man to death was revolting and remarkable in its details. He was conducted from the gaol to the place of execution in a mourning coach, which was guarded by a body of Light Dragoons, Sir Stafford Northcote's and Sir John de * There are at present three Regiments of Volunteers in Exeter, viz., the ist R.V., the Artillery, and the Engineers."], [168, "132 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. la Pole's troops of Volunteer Cavalry, and two companies of Exeter and neighbouring Volunteers. With a view to preventing a rescue, a battalion of Militia, with two field pieces, was ordered to march to the neighbourhood. The execution presented an awfully solemn spectacle. It is said that the unfortunate victim to the severity of the laws died much lamented, having hitherto borne a good character. In 1800, the poor again suffered great distress in conse quence of the high price of provisions. Wheat was upwards of a guinea a bushel, barley 18/- a bushel, beef, mutton, and pork iod., and butter 1/8 per lb., and potatoes were 2/- per peck, rates which at that time were considered excessive. These high prices were the cause of much public commotion. Driven to despair by hunger, large numbers of the poor assembled on Southernhay and other places, and proceeded in bands to the principal landowners of the surrounding country, compelling them to sign a contract to sell the people wheat and other necessaries at reduced prices. The mob did not resort to acts of violence; but the magistrates, fearing the results, ordered large numbers of additional constables to be sworn in. By the vigilance of this force, in preventing assemblies of the people, order to a certain extent was restored. To ameliorate the dis tressing condition of the poor as much as possible, subscriptions from the principal citizens were made ; bounties were granted for importing wheat, rice, etc., from foreign ports, and for bringing fish to the markets. In addition to this, large quantities of an inferior kind"], [169, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 133 of bread were ordered to be baked in the City, and sold under the direction of the overseers, at the different parish churches, at a much lower price than that asked by the bakers. Among the other measures of precaution taken to lessen the consumption as much as possible, and to prevent a famine, bakers were forbidden by act of parliament (under a severe penalty) to sell any kind of bread within twenty-four hours after the same was baked. At intervals subsequent to this period, the poor of Exeter have suffered great distress from the high prices which provisions have maintained (in December, 1816, the quartern loaf was sold at i7fd.), and serious riots were frequently the consequence. In May, 1847, there were riots in Exeter from this cause. The originator of it was a woman (a mat seller) popularly known as Sally Hunn, who gave the crowd the cue by smashing the windows of a baker's shop in the lower quarter of the City. From this small beginning, the disturbance grew on to serious proportions, nor could the riot be quelled until the services of the military were called into requisi tion. In the course of the riot, a party of the disturbers left the City with the intention of destroying the hayricks of Mr. Trood, of Kennford, who had rendered himself obnoxious to the rioters in some way; but tbe arrival of the military on the scene prevented the carrying out of the malicious purpose. In 1854 there was another riot, the origin of which was dear food. On Monday, November 4th, 1867, a riot of considerable proportions, said to have been provoked by the high prices of provisions (principally bread and meat) occurred"], [170, "134 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. in Exeter. Preparations to meet a disturbance on the following day (in connection with the Fifth of November celebrations) had been made by the authorities, and arrangements had been come to for a supply of soldiers from Plymouth. In this case the riot had its beginning earlier than expected, owing to a circumstance com paratively trifling. In the evening, about seven o'clock, a couple of boys were fighting near Exe Bridge, when one of them threw a stone, which went through the window of a baker's shop, kept by Mr. Dann, at the corner of Bonhay Road. A few people who were passing collected on hearing the crash of glass, and the inmates, fearing the rioting had commenced, sent to the Guildhall for police aid, and Superintendent Steel despatched a body of his men to the scene. A large crowd followed en route, and, by the time they had reached Mr. Dann's, the mob outside the shop had increased to about three hundred persons. The news quickly spread that the riot had commenced in the lower quarters of the City ; and the streets at once be came the scene of immense excitement. In a short space of time, about two thousand persons congregated at the bottom of Fore Street, where the scene was of a most lively character. For a while the throwing about of rockets formed the chief feature of the disturbance ; but it soon took the form of a deliberate smashing of the upstair window-s of Mr. Dann's premises, the lower having been meantime closed. The mob afterwards proceeded up the street, increasing in numbers and fury. On their way up Fore Street they"], [171, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 135 smashed the windows of the bakers' and butchers' shops, in many cases not a pane of glass being left in the windows in the sides of the premises abutting on the streets. At the top of Westgate Hill, the crowd divided itself into two sections, each soon growing to the pro portions of the whole, one party going up Fore Street, and the other down West Street. Nearly every shop in South Street, Holloway Street, and Magdalen Street was more or less injured by the rioters. The other section had proceeded to the higher parts of the City, passing dowm North Street, through Paul Street, and out again into High Street, via Goldsmith Street. At Mr. Row's, on St. David's Hill, the shutters were battered in, and the contents of the shop thrown out among the crowd. The rioters from St. David's met a mob from the south-west quarter at the corner of Southernhay : a portion of these went up St. Sidwell's, and another mob proceeded down Southernhay. Hardly a butcher or baker in the higher part of the City escaped molestation. At the premises of Mr. Scott, in St. Sidwell's, the mob opened the premises, lighted the gas, broke all the glass, and scattered the contents of the shop (bread and tea) among the outsiders. At Mr. Tapson's, in Newton, the premises were a complete wreck. The shutters and windows were smashed, bread taken away, and money stolen. At the house of Mr. Taylor, a loaded gun was presented at the heads of the mob, but it was soon wrested from the hands of the person holding it, and the work of destruction was vigorously proceeded with. Shops in the centre of the"], [172, "136 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. City, within a gunshot of the police station, were also attacked. About ten o'clock the staff of Militia attended by request at the Guildhall. They were about thirty in number, fully armed, and under the command of Capt. Saville. Shortly after this, the Mayor addressed the crowd from an upstair window of the Guildhall, counsel ling them to disperse quietly to their homes ; and in the meantime, Mr. Elias Tozer, Captain Richards, Mr. Welsford, and other well-known citizens, went in among the crowd, and pointed out the folly of expecting a reduction of food by destroying it. The reply was that it was impossible for people to live with provisions, especially bread (which was 8-|d. the four pound loaf), at their existing high prices. Whilst special constables were being sworn in, news was brought to the Guildhall of a renewal of the riot in the lower parts of the City, the premises of Mr. Holcombe, baker, Market Street, Mr. Surridge, miller, West Quarter, and Mr. Woodbridge, seed merchant, Fore Street, having been wrecked and the goods scattered in the streets. At the Mayor's request, Capt. Saville got his men ready, and they then commenced a perambulation of the town, with their rifles shouldered and bayonets fixed. About 200 special constables, accompanied by the Mayor and members of the police force, followed. As the procession was going down Fore Street Hill, having previously paraded the West Quarter, Coombe Street, and up South Street, the Mayor was informed"], [173, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 137 that the rioters were in St. Thomas. However, the Militia halted at the bottom of the hill, and prevented the mob from crossing the bridge. In St. Thomas there was a pitiable destruction of property. Sometime after midnight (soon after the wrecking of shops in St. Thomas) about fourteen members of the county police (under Mr. G. de C. Hamilton) arrived. They were drawn up in a line across the St. Thomas side of Exe Bridge, and succeeded in preventing an augmentation of the mob in the apostolic suburb from the Exeter side. About two o'clock the 20th (Foot Regiment), numbering about three hundred men, under the command of Capt. Gathan, and armed with the Snider breechloading rifle, arrived in Exeter by special train from Plymouth. The military, militia, and police, were divided into three sections, and patrolled different parts of the City for about half an hour. On returning to the Guildhall, the men were dismissed for the night, with the exception of 50, who were detained at the Guildhall as a guard. The following morning six prisoners were charged with riotously assembling the previous night and that morning, and dealt with accordingly."], [174, "138 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. CHAPTER XXII. Fifth of November riots\u2014 Miscellaneous events \u2014 Great Fires. \" ijOR many years past there have been attempts, , I I at intervals, to put down the Fifth of November celebrations; but they have been futile, and have only served to give new life to a custom which many people believe would, \" if left alone, die a natural death.\" In 1853, an endeavour was made to suppress the celebration by refusing to allow wood for the bonfires to be taken into the yard; and the Mayor (Mr. R. S. Cornish) thought to compensate the young people of Exeter for their loss in this particular, by providing a large display of fireworks in the Barnfield. This passed off well enough, but at eight o'clock there were loud cries raised \u2014 \" To the Yard, To the Yard.\" And to the Yard, accordingly, large numbers of people flocked. Police interference was, however, still feared ; and in order to draw the officers and the firemen off from the scene of their exploits, the ardent spirits caused a shed in New North Road to be fired. This was about nine o'clock ; and the device had the effect desired. Wood was then quickly carried into the Yard, a bonfire made and lighted, and soon the fun was raging as \" fast and furious \" as ever."], [175, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 139 The attempt to put a stop to \" Young Exeter's \" pro ceedings on Fifth of November in 1867 was on the day following the bread riot, which we have already described. As will have been gathered from the last mentioned narrative, the City on the Fifth was in a state of great excitement. The military were still in the town ; and a large number of special constables were sworn in. The authorities were resolved to put down the cele bration, but the ardent band \" Young Exeter \" had quite as thoroughly made up their minds to have the customary bonfire on their old \" battle field,\" the Cathedral Yard. Early in the afternoon, Exe Bridge was taken possession of by members of the County and City police forces, their object being to prevent wood being brought in from that quarter. About six o'clock two waggons, laden with wood, were seen coming towards the Bridge, from the direction of Cowick Street. On arriving at the Bridge, Capt. Saville ordered the drivers of the waggons to stop; and although they represented that the wood was for a baker in St. Sidwell's, they were not allowed to proceed. About eight o'clock a large body of special constables, under Major Moore, took up a position at Broadgate ; but, in the meantime, about a thousand persons had got into the Yard. At first the rioters contented themselves with throwing rockets at the specials ; but at length the missiles took the form of stones. This was too much for the men, who then charged the crowd. A severe struggle ensued, but in the end the specials were routed,"], [176, "140 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. and they escaped to the Guildhall, with two prisoners whom they managed to capture. Shortly afterwards the vanquished officers returned to the Yard, supported by a Company of the 20th Regiment, and as they marched in, the mob saluted them with hooting and yelling. Finding this force was not suf ficient to cope with the rioters, two troops of Yeomanry Cavalry (under Major the Earl of Devon, and Capts. Sanders, Buller, and Garrett) were sent to the scene of disorder. These latter took up their position at Broad gate, and had an exceedingly warm time of it. Rockets thrown among the troops caused the horses to rear and become unmanageable, and at length the Yeomanry were compelled to beat a retreat down North Street, with a hooting crowd at their heels. After this, \" Young Exeter,\" encouraged by their successes, became exceedingly jubilant, and soon the yard presented its usual features of excitement, the rocket display being described as exceedingly good. A party of men and youths marched down Fore Street and attempted to seize the two waggons of wood in St. Thomas ; but they were frustrated in their efforts by the combined forces of Militia and Police. As the disturbance at this point was likely to become serious, a company of the 20th Regiment afterwards repaired to the scene, and the rioters thereupon desisted from their purpose. It was many hours afterwards before the City regained its wonted quietude. The following day three prisoners were fined by the magistrates for discharging fireworks in the street."], [177, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 141 In 1879, during the Mayoralty of Mr. Wm. Horton Ellis, another unsuccessful attempt to suppress the celebration was made by the authorities. The police prevented wood being carried into the Yard, but the mob, determined to have a bonfire, resorted to tearing down the woodwork with which dwellings adjoining the site of the fire had been protected. On this occasion military assistance was also invoked by the police ; and a body of Royal Artillery from Topsham Barracks, armed with drawn swords and loaded rifles, were drafted into the City, for the purpose of dispersing the rioters. A body of Infantry was also held in readiness. All this military display, however, was absolutely unnecessary, for the rioters, chiefly young lads and girls, were cleared from the yard in the space of a few minutes by the police, after the Riot Act had been read by the Mayor. The following day several \"rioters\" were awarded what was looked upon as exceedingly harsh sentences of imprisonment, considering the nature of their offences. Since 1879 there has been no attempt to interfere with the celebration ; and it is hoped that by this time the authorities have learnt to display discretion as well as zeal, and that they will not in future provoke (though unintentionally) disturbances of the City's tranquility by interfering with \"Young Exeter,\" so long as he continues to carry out his observance of the old custom in the orderly and careful manner adopted at present. On many occasions, in addition to those we have already recorded, Exeter has been the scene of popular demon strations, both of a joyous and melancholy character. In"], [178, "142 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 1801, the inhabitants were in a flutter in consequence of Lord Nelson passing through the City, the freedom of which he was presented with ; and four years later (November 13th) there were grand illuminations in honour of his victory. On June 14th, 1814, there were joyous demonstrations at the peaceful termination of the American war ; and there were great rejoicings at the conclusion of the Crimean war in 1856. On this occasion (May 29th), there were public dinners provided for 10,000 poor persons, in the Market, in St. Sidwell's, St. Leonards, and other parts of the City. Politically, Exeter has not been devoid of exciting episodes, and among them we may mention the public joy which was manifested in the City on the passing of the Reform Bill in 1832; the great Chartist demonstration which took place here in 1840; and the mass meeting which was held in October, 1885, in celebration of the Extension of the Franchise to the Counties. Of late years, as well as in former times, branches of the Royal family have at different periods honoured Exeter with their presence ; and on the occasions of rejoicing or of mourning in connection with Royalty, old Semper Fidelis has never been backward in a proper expression of loyalty in whatever direction called for. During the present centur)', Exeter has severely suffered at different times through fire, flood, and tempest ; but we have not space to go into details on this subject here. In the matter of fires, the last century closed with two very serious conflagrations. On 12th December, 1775, the Fortune of War, an inn (situated"], [179, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 143 near the old Exe Bridge) which was the common resort of vagrants, who lodged there in large numbers for a penny a night, was burned down. Nine of the lodgers perished in the flames, and others were much scorched. There were about thirty persons in the place at the time of the outbreak, which originated through the overboiling of a pot of brimstone, from which matches were being made. By a fire which occurred on the 28th of July, 1799, thirteen houses, chiefly occupied by poor weavers, near the Black Boy Turnpike (the head of St. Sidwell's) were destroyed. Since that time there have been many serious conflagra tions, and several have ended fatally. Six houses were burnt down in St. Thomas on the 6th of May, 1836, and two women lost their lives in attempting to save their goods. During more recent years, fires have occurred in the City with alarming frequency and with disastrous results.* By the destruction of the Black Lion's Inn, South Street, in September, 1873, several lives were lost; and in many cases there have been narrow escapes of life. Lovers of the drama had to lament the destruction, for the second time, of the Theatre, by the \"all devouring element,\" on the 7th February of the present year, 1885. By the destruction of the Theatre, the play-going section of the Exonians sustained a great loss, but as we are going to press, we have the cheering intelligence that Mr. Bevan, who has received the contract for building a new Theatre at the top of Longbrook Street, has commenced operations. * The following is a record of some of the more serious conflagrations since 1800 : \u2014 1818, October 25th \u2014 At Mr. Froom's, Druggist, North Street."], [180, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 144 1820, March 7th\u2014 Exeter Theatre. 1826, March 23rd \u2014 At Mr. Ward's, CoachbuilJer, Paris Street. 1826, October 6th \u2014 At Messrs.

Cholera Outbreaks \u2014 The Visitation of 1832 \u2014 Unsanitary condition of the City \u2014 Distressing particulars \u2014 The subsequent Outbreaks. '\"\u25a0\"V URING the present century, there have been two M w or three cholera outbreaks in Exeter, that of 1832 being the most serious. The disorder which devastated the City in that year originated, in 1817, in the Delta of the Ganges, burst forth in Russia in 1831 ; and rapidly approached the Devonshire capital. Until the disorder was fairly upon the inhabitants, they seemed scarcely able to realize the possibility of its advent. The remarkable state of feeling of the people \" may be learned from the articles published on this subject by local papers\" (says the gifted author of a very clever work on the Cholera in 1832, Dr. Shapter). \"At one time, the reality of the disease is asserted, and the greatest fears are expressed and apparently entertained ; at another, its existence is denied, and those who venture to assert such a proposition are stigmatised as credulous, if not actuated by sinister motives Nevertheless, to complete the inconsistencies of the times, various schemes for its prevention and cure are plentifully chronicled.\" At length, however, it was seen that an outbreak of the fell disorder was inevitable, and then every possible step was taken to cope with the evil. Measures of"], [183, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 147 sanitary reform (too long neglected by the authorities) were introduced ; and with a view to prevent the infection being imported into the City, quarantine regulations were stringently enforced. Through the inadvertence of the Tide Surveyor at Exmouth, however, a vessel called the Ranger, of Exeter (Woofe, Master), arrived at the Quay from London. On the voyage one of the crew had died of cholera, and the arrival of the vessel created a deal of alarm and indignation. The Ranger (which arrived on the 19th of July) was, however, placed under strict quarantine and detained until the 28th. It is noted as a remarkable fact, that the occur rence was \"simultaneous with, if not anterior to, the arrival of this vessel.\" On the 23rd of July, Exeter was declared an infected port ; on the 3rd of November the last case was declared convalescent, and on the 13th of November clean bills of health were issued.* The cholera, as will appear from the last paragraph, broke out in Exeter on July 19th, and from that date, down to the 27th October, there were 1335 cases and 345 deaths reported. + In consequence of the crowded state of Exeter's two public places of interment \u2014 the Bartholomew and Southernhay burial grounds \u2014 loud remonstrances were made against any further burials in them. Bury Meadow, in the parish of St. David's, was there fore procured for this purpose ; and the body of a person who had died of cholera was ordered to be interred therein. But the parishioners became so annoyed at the * Dr. Shapter. t There were others in addition to those officially recorded-"], [184, "148 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. appropriation of ground in their parish, that something like a riot took place. \" The grave digger's webs were cut to pieces, his tools scattered abroad, he himself assaulted, and eventually obliged to fly ; while the warden of the parish retained many persons in his own house during the night, in order to prevent any further attempt at the interment.\"* It transpired, however, that Bury Meadow was not yet a legally constituted burial ground, and the body was consequently laid in the Bartholomew yard early the following morning, the procession being followed through the streets by a noisy and abusive mob, who objected to the coffin being carried \"underhand.\" There were great and seemingly insurmountable difficulties in connection with the setting apart of Bury Meadow for the purposes of a burial ground. At length, however, it was legally dedicated to that purpose, for the space of ten years from the date of the last interment ; and the Bishop gave the clergy license to read the funeral service at the burial of bodies therein. Relatives and friends of persons interred in Bury Meadows were allowed to erect tombstones on the graves ; but they had to give an undertaking that they would remove the same, if re quired, at the end of the ten years ; and of these conditions many availed themselves. The first few of the poorer persons who died of the cholera were carried to the graves by bearers \" under hand,\" but this was a cause of much dissatisfaction to * Dr. Shapter. t In addition to this place of interment, a cholera burial ground was opened in Pester Lane, St. Sidwell's,"], [185, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 149 the people, \" not only as being contrary to custom, but from their esteeming it a mark of ignominy and dis respect.\" The Corporation of the Poor, therefore, decided to provide a hearse for the purpose ; and this being subsequently found to be insufficient, another was provided, at the expense of the Board of Health. The graves of the first victims of the outbreak, who were buried in the ordinary grave yards of the City, were ordered to be dug an extra depth, of not less than six feet ; and when filled in, the surface mound was covered with a layer of lime. It is said that the effect of this on passing by the burial grounds was very start ling. People became so shocked at the practice, that it was subsequently discontinued, the graves being then dug from eight to ten feet, and the lime placed over the coffins. \" A scene not unusual in the burial ground \" (says Dr. Shapter) \"was two men without coats, their shirt sleeves turned up to their elbows, with short tobacco pipes in their mouths, carrying a coffin ' underhand ' towards the grave ; at a good distance off from the grave, was the surpliced clergyman performing the last solemn duty of religion. If this were by night, as was frequently the case, there was also the flickering light of one or two lanterns. Such was the scene on the 16th August, when the last burial of a person dying of cholera took place in Bartholomew Yard. The circum- stances accompanying this funeral are not devoid of interest ; it took place at midnight, the moon shone bright and calm, and when the grave was filled in, the"], [186, "150 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. old grave digger placed over it the oldest tombstone in the yard.\"* The portion of the City where the disorder existed to the most alarming extent was the West Quarter, and also other poorer parts of the place, the inhabitants of which were in a most deplorable condition. The drainage was bad, the water supply was inadequate, and the reports of the district committees revealed a state of things which was almost beyond the bounds of credibility. There were dwellings occupied by from five to fifteen families \" huddled together in dirty rooms, with every offensive accompaniment.\" Pigs were kept in large numbers throughout the City, and the description appended to one house stated that there were \" thirty-one pigstyes kept in such a state as would beggar description.\" Poultry were kept in confined cellars and outhouses ; there were refuse heaps everywhere \u2014 \"one courtlage was visited in which the accumulated filth and soil of thirteen years was deposited, and esteemed so valuable a property that its removal was strenuously resisted.\" The frequent exhortations of the Board of Health which had been established, and the \" constant assid uity \" of the police and others, failed to induce the lower classes to change their filthy modes of living ; but on the contrary \"they fell into low dissipations of many kinds with an unusual intensity. The existence of the disease was denied or derided, wanton songs were * This stone (a blue one) covered the last resting place of one Salathiel Jennings, who was interred in the ground shortly after its consecration by Bishop Hall, on the 24th August, 1637."], [187, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 151 sung about it, and drunkenness increased to a frightful extent ; brandy was the panacea for all their ills.\" Riots at funerals and on other occasions were common, medical men (the object of all sorts of suspicions and misappre hension) were frequently insulted, and profligacy was largely on the increase. Brandy drinking (a supposed preventative of the cholera) was carried on to an alarming extent, and many remarkable instances occurred of people being attacked with the disease \"during a delirium thus produced, and from which the head never cleared.\" More than one unfortunate being, who had treated the subject in the night as one for jeers and ribald songs, was found dead before morning, whilst cases of deaths after the manifestations of extreme anxiety on the part of healthy persons were also numerous. The condition of the City was desolate in the extreme, and its general silence, broken only by the tolling of the bells for the dead, is described as being remark- able. The streets were deserted, \" the hurried steps of the medical men and their assistants, or of those running to seek their aid, alone were heard, while the one-horse hearse occasionally passing on its duty, was almost the only carriage to be seen in the usually busy streets.\"* At length, the ravages of the disorder became so great, that the people thought it their duty to appeal to the Almighty, and the 22nd August was set apart as a day of humiliation. During the prevalence of the disease, and with a view to prevent its spreading, various measures were adopted, * Dr. Shapter."], [188, "152 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. such as fumigations, the use of chloride of lime, white washing, and the burning of the wearing apparel of those who had died. At the commencement the clothes were burnt \u2014 chiefly on a spot of ground near the Shilhay, but also in a field in Lions Holt, St. Sidwell's \u2014 but as the smoke from the consuming materials sometimes passed over the City the burning was discontinued, and the articles buried, instead. Later still, instead of being either burned or buried, they were washed in the river and then saved. Notwithstanding the fact that the cholera was raging in Exeter, the Assizes were held, the judges seeing no proper reason for their adjournment, and during Assize week the Theatre was opened as usual, but the play, \" William Tell \" (with after pieces) was performed to a \" beggarly account of empty boxes.\" Exeter was again visited with the cholera in 1833 an^ 1834 ; and in 1846 there were one or two cases, but they were not fatal. In 1866, there was another outbreak, which commenced about the beginning of August. Many hundreds of people, men, women, and children, were attacked, and a large number died ; but not nearly so many as in previous epidemics in the City, mainly because of the more enlightened and efficient mode of treatment, and the improved sanitary arrangements. Collis Browne's chlorodyne and chloroform entered largely into the medicine generally prescribed, and the medical men, too, had the power to order the attendance of nurses, where desirable in the interests of the patients. They likewise were able to order packets of groceries and"], [189, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 153 other comforts for the very- poor, and to facilitate this wise and benevolent purpose, certain grocers in different parts of the City kept a person in attendance at their shops on Sundays, to issue goods ordered by requisition of the surgeons. This very thoughtful and humane custom was suggested by the Mayor of Exeter (Mr. R. T. Head), and readily sanctioned by the Council. The latter body also instituted a system of house to house visitation by sub-committees of two of its members, to see that the water closets were in good order ; and other sanitary arrangements were carried out. No doubt some existing nuisances were by that means abated, but, unfortunately, so soon as the epidemic subsided, the zeal of the Council collapsed, this seeming to shew that in times past the City authorities have systematically avoided the adoption of proper sanitary measures till some terrible outbreak has rendered the making of improvements imperative. Mr. S. H. Culley, of Exeter, who rendered valuable services in the capacity of an amateur doctor during the raging of the epidemic, says in a letter addressed on the subject to the author : \u2014 \" From the 8th August to the nth November, I attended 156 patients, and am thankful to think and say that by the help and blessing of Almighty God, I was instrumental in curing the patient in nearly every case, only three or four dying of cholera, and in each of those instances, I believe that had I been earlier in attendance they would have been saved.\" The cures in each of the cases mentioned were effected by the administration of chlorodyne, principally, and the"], [190, "154 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. application of mustard piasLcrs to the lower portions of the body. One case of true heroism, worthy of being chronicled and held in remembrance, was shewn by a poor woman, a fish hawker, who volunteered to nurse gratuitously a woman who was very ill, and who, but for the kindness of her voluntary nurse, would most probably have died. Everyone living in the same house were either themselves afflicted with cholera, or afraid of being infected by contact with those stricken by the plague. Her conduct was the more praiseworthy and heroic from the fact that at the time the proportion of deaths was greater than at any other period during this visitation. The services of Mr. William Hare, then in business as a druggist, in Paris Street, were most opportune and praiseworthy. He volunteered to take the infected bed ding and clothes worn by the many who had died of the disorder, and burn them in a boat at the Quay, this being with a view to prevent as far as possible the spread of infection. In a noble spirit of self sacrifice, and con scious of the great importance of the work, he cheerfully, from day to day, and sometimes far into the night, performed his dangerous and self inposed task. He also attended a good number of the afflicted, and with his own hand administered medicine, etc.; and no doubt, many lives were saved by his gratuitous aid. As we write now, Mr. Hare's services are being brought prominently before the citizens. He has attained to his declining years, and his wife is sorely afflicted and bed ridden. We are pleased, however, to see that a public"], [191, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 155 subscription has been organized to enable him to qualify for a residence in one of the Free Cottages on Mount Dinham.* After this lapse of time, Mr. Culley looks back with gratitude on the fact, that neither his wife, who accom panied him night and day for several weeks in his visits, nor himself, \" took the slightest harm from infection.\" In closing this chapter, we may mention that the prevalence of the cholera in Spain during the summer months of 1885 once more aroused the \"sanitary spirit\" of the Exeter authorities. Happily, however, those foes to cholera \u2014 good drainage, pure water, effective scavenging, etc. \u2014 have thus far warded off the attack, though there have been one or two cases of \" scare.\" * Since writing the above, the practical recognition of Mr. Hare's services has become an established fact."], [192, "156 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. CHAPTER XXIV. Old Exeter \u2014 Its Sanitary condition \u2014 Ancient houses \u2014 The Markets, as formerly held. OONSIDERING the matters with which it was our duty to deal in the last chapter, we think this will be a fitting point at which to draw a com- parison between Exeter as we see it now, and the City it was during the early and middle portions of the present century. The streets of old Exeter generally were narrow, and in most instances (except in the chiefest thoroughfares) the pavements were made of pebble pitching, with a gutter running through the centre (such as may now be seen in Preston Street, etc.) as about the only means of carrying off the sewage and nuisances of the place. With the exception of the numerous private wells, the water supply for the poorer inhabitants \u2014 even in the time of the 1832 cholera outbreak \u2014 consisted almost entirely of that afforded by the ancient Conduit. This was formerly situated at Cairfox, but was, in the year 1799, removed to South Street (against College Hall), in consequence of the great inconvenience which occurred by reason of so many people congregating there to draw water. In the year 1834 it was again removed, for the purpose of widening the street, and was replaced by that now"], [193, "OLD HOUSE .

The vicinity of the Conduit was the scene of many amusing episodes. There were frequent quarrels as to right of precedency in the drawing of water ; and often the transactions were characterised by broken heads, as well as by broken pitchers. Water was also obtained by dipping from the river, and under the part of the town wall known as the Battery there were steps which led down to the river's edge, for the convenience of the water carriers. It was the custom of the latter to convey the water about in buckets, with a piece of flat wood floating in each, to prevent it splashing over. The buckets were kept apart by a hoop which rested on the upper rims, and against which the inner portions of the handles, held by the carrier, pressed. Some, however, suspended the buckets across the shoulders by a broad belt with iron hooks at the end ; and they were thus able to move in the centre of the hoop with the arms at liberty. The inhabitants of the more distant quarters of the City were supplied with water brought round in casks fixed on a small cart,* and drawn either by hand or donkey power ; the cost of the water being a half-penny a bucket. In order to water the streets, the fire plugs were turned on, and the water which escaped therefrom was dammed up into deep pools, and then thrown over the surrounding surface by men with large wooden shovels. * See Illustration."], [198, "158 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. An idea of the terrible lives led by the poorer classes may be gathered from the reference to that subject in our brief account of the 1832 cholera. They herded to gether like swine, grovelled in filth, led profligate lives, and lived in houses and in situations which were over crowded and unhealthy. Many of the dwellings, however, were formerly the residences of opulent citizens ; and some of those remaining in our worst neighbourhoods to day are interesting as specimens of ancient architecture. In Mary Arches Street, some of the old buildings remaining are of \" Queen Anne's and more recent times, and mingled with those of Edward VI. and Elizabeth.\"* There are some good specimens of the old English house remaining in Fore Street, and in Goldsmith Street there were some capital specimens of the period of Elizabeth and James I. Those which stood on the right hand were removed for the purpose of erecting the Lower Market ; and more recently (1885) the greater portion of the remainder of the houses on that side have been demolished, for the purpose of widening the street. In Smythen Street, in the Butcher-row, there are specimens of the class of house erected about the time of Elizabeth and subsequently. Stepcote Hill, situated in what is now a miserable locality, was at one time an important thoroughfare, being situated immedi ately opposite the Westgate, and by many it is now known as the \" Old Fore Street.\" The ancient houses are of the Elizabethan period. The lighting, like the sanitary accommodation and * Dr. Shapter."], [199, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 159 water supply, was inadequate. At night the streets were very dark, people having to find their way about by the aid of such light as could be obtained from horn lanterns, whilst the peace of the City was inefficiently maintained by^watchmen. The markets were held in the public thoroughfares of High Street and Fore Street (the side of the street being changed every six months) on Tuesdays and Fridays, the latter being the largest and most important. The market for china, stoneware, pottery, glass, etc., ex tended from Eastgate to King's Alley, and that for butter, poultry, etc., on to Goldsmith Street. From thence to Broadgate was the pork butchers' shambles, and the crook from which the public scales for weighing were suspended may still be seen in the centre arch of the Guildhall front.* There was another market for butter and poultry, extending from Broadgate to North Street ; thence to Mary Arches Street, vendors of veget ables, fruit and flowers stood ; from there to tbe mint were located dealers in leather, tin, toys, and fancy goods, and thence to the middle of Fore Street there were standings with boots and shoes, china ware, etc. The butchers' and the corn markets were situated on the site of the present entrance to the Lower Market. The leather dealers traded in the lofts over the butchers' market \u2014 skins were sold in the Market itself; and the serge makers did their business in Cathedral Yard, oppo site the Globe Hotel. The fish, potato, and oat market * In the room at present occupied by the Inspectors of Police were a pair of stocks in which drunkards were placed for punishment."], [200, "160 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. was held on what is the site of Queen Street, and the cattle market was carried on in Bartholomew Street.* On market days there was generally a very large influx of country people and others, and the City pre sented a bustling and interesting appearance. It is supposed that as many as 3000 persons frequently passed through the Red Cow turnpike gate (either riding, driving, or walking) on a market day ; and the hotel and inn-keepers, as well as the ordinary trades men, did \" a roaring business.\" On fair days the streets were crowded, the pleasure fairs being particularly popular. Lent fair was generally held in March, and the staUs were chiefly laden with sweet meats and toys. At Midsummer fair, held about June, there was a range of standings from Eastgate to Mary Arches Street, the articles sold from them comprising toys, crockeryware, sweets, woollen, leather, and tin goods, etc. Lammas fair (to which we have had occasion to make reference in previous chapters) was held in August, and was essentially a pleasure fair. It commenced \" on the Friday, by a procession starting from Westgate, consisting of the head constable, with a roll of parchment (tied with blue ribbons), containing the charter for holding the fair, which was read aloud by him at the site of the * \" I have seen (says Mr. Cousins, the author of Reminiscences of Exeter) the cattle from the corner of North Street to Friernhay Street, thence pens of sheep to the Baptist Chapel, from thence to the bottom, near Fore Street hill, and called Pig Market, but now Lower Bartholomew Street, pigs lying in front of shops and dwelling houses.\""], [201, ""], [202, "CONs-ECT / O N \u00a3f?Y \u00b0STA IS/Of/Ve\","], [203, "161 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. old gates; two staff bearers accompanied him, with their three cornered hats, also two fifers and one drummer, followed by a man carrying a very long blue and white pole, surmounted by flowers, and an immense stuffed white glove, and hundreds of children following.\"* After the perambulation, the glove was mounted on the front of the Guildhall, and remained there during the three days which the fair lasted. The perambulation (minus the head constable) and the mounting of the glove are customs still observed on Lammas fair day, but the pleasure fair (as remarked previously) has dwindled down to one solitary standing in Fore Street, and of this an illustration is given. The cattle fair was held in Bartholomew Street ; a serge fair in South Street ; a shoe fair from London Inn Square to Northernhay Gate; a leather fair over the old butchers' market ; Whetstone fair (held annually) in Waterbeer Street ; and the horse fair on Southernhay, from Dix's field to the Barnfield. Woollen was formerly Exeter's staple trade, and in different parts of the City \" racks \" were erected for drying and stretching the goods manufactured in the neighbourhood. \" The operative part of the woollen trade carried on within this City was entirely confined to the finishing of the pieces for use after they had been spun and wove. From the warehouses within the City, the raw materials were distributed to the neighbouring villages, and then returned in the piece. Here the pieces * Reminiscences of Exeter Fifty Years Since.

CHAPTER XXV. Modern Exeter\u2014 Sanitary and Street Improvements \u2014 The Water and Gas Works\u2014 New Exe Bridge. aOMING to the modern portion of our subject, we will first of all briefly trace the history of Exeter's water supplies. In 1694, a scheme which had been long contemplated, but had hitherto been found impracticable, was determined on, and the Chamber of Exeter obtained an act of Parlia ment for establishing water works, water from the Exe being conveyed through wooden pipes to the dwellings of those who chose to pay a reasonable price for it. The undertaking was leased out for 200 years. In 1808, the un expired lease of about 80 years was bought from the then lessee, Mr. James Goldsworthy. The works were situated on the leat near Head Weir (still known as Engine Leat), and the water was forced up by a large stream wheel. The supply thus derived was, however, impure and in adequate, and great difficulty was experienced in forcing the water higher than High Street level at the point where the Guildhall is situated, the more elevated parts being totally unprovided for in this way. In addition to this inconvenience, a great waste was suffered, owing to leakages, but an improvement was effected in this direction by the substitution of iron pipes. The supply"], [208, "164 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. was more copious, but yet inadequate ; and in 1883, a company was formed for carrying out the works necessary to procure a proper supply. By this body, the present works were then established. Under existing arrange ments, the water is forced from Pynes (about three miles from the City) to Dane's Castle reservoir, behind the gaol, and thence to Marypole Head (an elevation of 200 feet). The latter supplies the upper quarters of the City and Heavitree, and the two reservoirs together have a storage capacity of 7,500,000 gallons. With the increase of population this amount was found to be still inadequate ; and in 1878 the Town Council purchased the present works at a cost of At the present time there is a good and abundant supply of water for all parts of the City ; and with the steps which are taken to secure adequate storage \u2014 and to prevent waste \u2014 such a thing as a failure of the supply during the heaviest drought need not be feared. With such a source at command, and a sufficient at the disposal of every householder, much is done towards the thorough sanitation of the City \u2014 a subject to which the Town Council now happily pay great attention. Since the City was first lit with gas in 181 7, the works which belong to the Exeter Gas Light and Coke Com pany have been considerably enlarged. By this means, the City and suburbs are brilliantly illuminated ; and of late years gas has been used for heating and other purposes to a large extent. Its adaptability for cooking and motive power (even in machine rooms of considerable dimensions) was most conclusively proven at an exhibi-"], [209, "165 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. tion held a year or two since at the Victoria Hall. At the time we write, there may be seen, at the Company's Offices in High Street, one of the celebrated Bisschop engines driven by gas power. The company was estabished by act of Parliament in 1815, with a capital of raised in \u00a3\"25 shares. In 1883, Exonians had the opportunity of testing the virtues of electricity for purposes of illumination. In November of that year the Devon Evening Express company (and shortly afterwards the proprietors of the Exeter and Plymouth Gazette) illuminated their premises with incan descent lamps, and the splendid lights from the arc lamps suspended outside both those offices were a great attraction so long as they remained there. From causes best known to the proprietors of the premises in question, the electric lighting was subsequently abandoned. Since that time, however, great improvements in this system of illumi nation have taken place; and the Town Council recently (after some opposition) determined to light their new Asylum at Digby's by electricity. Properly speaking, the birth of the spirit of improve ment in Exeter dates from the latter part of the eighteenth century. The increase of traffic vid the Northgate in due time pointed out the necessity of the removal of that interesting and ancient structure, and the filling up to a certain extent of the deep ravine outside, commonly called the \" Pit.\" The declivity was, however, still inconveniently steep, and that massive structure known as the Iron Bridge was erected in 1834, by Messrs. Russel and Brown, of Worcester, at a cost of"], [210, "166 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. The bridge comprises six arches of 40 feet span, and a roadway of 24 feet wide. The Eastgate was demolished in October 1784; the Westgate and Quay gate were removed in 1815; and the Southgate, with its hideous prison, was taken down in 1819. Up to 1770, the splendid view of the Castle which we now have was obscured by a number of houses. In the year mentioned these were removed to widen the street, which previously was dangerously narrow. The old gate of the Castle was demolished and a new one, over which an imitation portcullis was placed, was erected. In levelling the road some interesting dis coveries were made. The foundation of the ancient drawbridge which crossed the fosse was unearthed, and the present gateway was built with the stones of it. Several brass coins were also among the discoveries. In the same year (1770) the Conduit at Cairfoix, a handsome structure, was removed to South Street, out side College Hall (and subsequently to its present site). The old Exe Bridge, which directed pedestrian and vehicular traffic through the Westgate, by St. Edmund's Church, being found inconvenient, and the route circuitous and dangerous, the present structure at the foot of Fore Street Hill was erected. The design of Mr. Joseph Dixon, of St. James's, Westminster, for constructing a bridge of three arches only over the river in a direct line from Cowick Street to Fore Street, removing the church of Ail Hallows on the Wall, and to raise up the space inter vening on walls and on five arches, to give a fresh passage for the water of the mill leats, was adopted. It"], [211, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 167 was also decided to erect a large dry arch under the new road, with a flight of steps on the north side to give access to the Exe Island and Frog Street. The Mayor of Exeter (Mr. John Floud) laid the foundation stone of the proposed bridge on Thursday, 4th October, 1770, and for sometime the work made rapid progress. It was at length suspected, however, that Mr. Dixon was doing his task inefficiently, and enquiry shewed that there had been several serious deviations from the original plans. By an inundation which occurred on the 9th of March, 1774, a great deal of damage was done to the work ; and another flood, which occurred on the 1 8th January in the following year, destroyed the foun dation and carried away all the arches. Mr. John Goodwin, who had been employed in the erection, and had discovered where the faults lay, took the work in hand. By diverting the stream into a channel near the old bridge, and clearing the bed of the river, he was enabled to prepare a foundation for the piers on the solid rock. The \" first \" stone was laid on July 15th, 1776, by the Rev. Chancellor Nutcombe, and so rapidly was the work carried on, that early in 1778, in the month of March, the new bridge was opened for traffic, the first carriage that passed over it from Fore Street being one in the funeral procession of Sir John Elwill, Bart., who died on the ist of March, 1778. The expense of this great improvement to the City was thirty thousand pounds. It was at first proposed to exact a toll from foot passengers over the bridge, but this proposal was strenuously opposed by Sir Charles Warwick Bam-"], [212, "168 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. field and Mr. John Baring (members for the City, in Parliament), and it was ultimately abandoned. By the removal of the gates and the erection of the new Bridge, the avenues and approaches to the City underwent a considerable change for the better, and from that period Exeter gradually transformed itself into the place we see it now \u2014 a City vastly improved, but still improving. In 1773, the erection of the North side of Bedford Circus, on the site of what was anciently the residence of the Earls and Dukes of Bedford in Exeter, was commenced, and in digging for the foundation of some of the houses erected thereon, lead coffins, human remains, and many other antiquities were found ; the South side was commenced in 1825. The year 1774 saw the destruction of the old court houses inside the Castle Yard, and the erection of the present (not very handsome) block of Assize Courts. In the course of the operations, St. Mary's Chapel and the Castellian's House were taken down, and its Donjon, Sally Port, etc., were destroyed, much to the regret of local lovers of the antique. The building of the houses on Southernhay commenced in 1795 ;* and the first stone of Colleton Crescent was laid on the 3rd of September, 1802. The following year the builders were busy in the erection of the Barracks in Topsham Road, the Higher Barracks having been finished in 1794; and the opening of the New North Road took place in 1854. Queen Street was built in 1836. We have already seen the inconvenience which arose from the custom of holding the markets in High Street * They were completed on May 20th, 1824."], [213, ""], [214, "CATH E&/N \u00a3 STR\u00a3\u00a3T"], [215, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 169 and Fore Street, and the erection of our two markets, the Eastern in Queen Street, and the Western in Fore Street, was hailed by the inhabitants as a decided boon. The foundation stone of the Western market was laid on the 14th April, 1835, and that of the Eastern on the 8th of May in the same year; the Western market was first opened on the gth December, 1836, and the Eastern on the 24th July, 1S38. The opening of the Dispensary in Queen Street took place on December 28th, 1841, of the new Cemetery on the 26th of May, 1866, and the view of Bedford Circus from High Street was opened up on October 2nd, 1876, by the construction of new Bedford Street. The foundation stone of the Arcade and Eastgate Coffee Tavern, which necessitated the removal of the fine old Grammar School of St. John's Hospital, was laid on August -2nd, 1880; and, coming down to May 26th in the present year, 1885, we find the opening of that splendid addition to the buildings in the City, the new Post Office. Up to the date of opening the new building, the business of the Postal Department in Exeter was carried on in the premises in Queen Street, adjoining the Museum ; previously to that the Post Office was situated further up the street (opposite the Higher Market), and earlier still in Catherine Street (near the Bamfylde Mews), and in Cathedral Yard and Gandy Street (see illustration). The new building is said to be one of the most complete of its kind in the Kingdom. The Contractor was Mr. Bevan, of Plymouth, the building operations being under the Supervision of Mr. H. Suff, of H.M. Office of Works, assisted by Mr. Spencer James"], [216, "170 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. (the local chief Superintendent). The new office was opened to the public on Monday, 26th September, at 7 a.m., the first mail being despatched the previous night. In addition to the new Post Office, some other magnifi cent buildings have beer, erected in recent years, notably those of Messrs. Ellis, Depree and Tucker (an illustration of which we give), Messrs. Brock's and Wheaton's, at the corner of North Street, the premises of Messrs. Lloyd opposite, those of Messrs. Wippel facing the Guildhall, the Constitutional Club, and those at present occupied as the Bon Marche, in St. Sidwells. Not only has the City improved from a sanitary and structural point of view, not only has the lighting and water supply improved also, but important changes have likewise taken place in the mode of travelling. In the old coaching days about seventy mails and coaches left Exeter daily, on an average, starting on all occasions from the new London Inn. The \"Quicksilver,\" said to have been the fastest mail in England (travelling from Exeter to London in twenty-four hours), and the celebrated coach \"Defiance\" were among the vehicles which were engaged in the traffic between Exeter and the great Metropolis. The coaching brought a great deal of business to the City, and it is said that in the parish of St. Sidwells alone three thousand persons derived their means of living from employment in connection with this mode of traffic. In the stables at the new London Inn, there were from 150 to 200 horses daily. The London mail arrived in Exeter about four o'clock in the afternoon, and the letters were generally delivered"], [217, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 171 about six ; but in winter, during fogs, the delivery did not take place till the following morning. In those days it was a common sight to witness a farmer riding in to town on horseback, with his wife on a pillion behind him, an immense gingham, to keep off the sun or rain, frequently completing the picture. Goods were generally brought in on panniers, suspended on each side of the animal ; and steps (known as upping stocks) were erected in inn yards, and other places, for the con venience of persons mounting or dismounting. Travelling on horseback with saddle bags was common among the representatives of commercial houses. Sedan chairs were in use during the reign of that means of locomotion. Stage coaches, panniers, pillions, upping stocks, pack horses, and Sedan chairs, are now things of the past, so far as ordinary traffic is concerned, and the railway, hackney carriages, and the tramway reign in their stead. On May ist, 1844, the Bristol Railway (despite the opposition of the Corporation) was extended to Exeter; the South Devon Railway to Teignmouth was opened on May 31st, 1846, and extended to Plymouth three years later; a railway was opened to Crediton in 1851, and there were grand doings on July 18th, 1860, on the occasion of the opening of the South Western Railway to Queen Street, the line being extended to Devonport on the 30th June, 1876. A portion of the tramway from the Bude Hotel to Heavitree was opened on April 6th, 1882, and the complete line from St. David's Station to the top of Bath Road was ready for use by August, 1883. The establishment of the Tramway system in"], [218, "172 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. Exeter is a great convenience to the citizens, and when the tradesmen of High Street see fit to withdraw their opposition to its extension through that street, the boon will be complete. We cannot close this chapter without referring to the fact, that with the growth of the spirit of improvement, many institutions \u2014 useful and philanthropic in their pur poses \u2014 have arisen in the City. The Hospital, Dispensary, Eye Infirmary, Deaf and Dumb and Blind Institutions, the Dental Hospital, the Reformatories, the Penitentiary, the Homes for Friendless Girls, etc., will stand as living monuments to the charitable spirits of their founders. Nor must we forget to mention such useful institutions as the Literary Society, the Working Men's Mutual Improvement Society and kindred associations. The Horticultural Society and Bee Keepers' Associations are both useful in their way ; and although the Apple and Pear Show Society, and the Fat Stock Society, are, as yet, in their infancy (both having their origin during the Mayoralty of Mr. R. C. Wilkinson, himself the son of a public spirited mayor), they bid fair to rank among the most useful of Exeter's institutions.* * A complete list of these will be seen in our appendix,"], [219, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 173 CHAPTER XXVI. The Cathedral, Guildhall, Castle, and Prisons \u2014 Public Executions- Revolting Scenes. OUR noble Cathedral stands on the site of the monastery of St. Peter, which was originally founded early after the West Saxons had been converted by St. Birinus, A.D. 633. With other edifices it fell a prey to Sweyne's vengeance in 1003, but in the time of Canute was rebuilt. Leofric, the first Bishop of Exeter, took its conventual church for his Cathedral, and at his death was buried in the crypt under the chantry of St. James. No portion of his Cathedral, however, now remains; and of the more sumptuous edifice which William Warelwast, third Bishop of Exeter, commenced in 11 12, only the two massive towers remain. Our present Cathedral dates from the latter part of the episcopate of Bishop Brones combe (A.D. 1270), who probably built the lower portion of the Lady Chapel, with the adjacent Chauntries of St. Mary Magdalen and St. Gabriel. Portions of the choir aisles, and of the Chauntries of St. Andrew and St. James, with the chambers over them, are also attributed to the same prelate. The work was continued by his successor, Bishop Quivil, who erected the upper portion of the Lady Chapel, probably threw open to it the adja cent chauntries, constructed a transept out of the two"], [220, "174 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. towers, and the large window at each extremity of the transept. During the episcopate of Bishop Bytton (A.D. 1291-1307), the Lady Chapel was roofed ; and the choir aisles vaulted and leaded, paved and glazed. The four eastward bays of the choir are ascribed to Bishop Staple don, who laid out about twelve hundred pounds on the building, making many important additions. Under Bishop Grandisson, the building advanced with satis factory rapidity, and by December 18th, 1328, he was enabled to dedicate the high altar. This Bishop proceeded with the nave, erected the chantries of St. Paul in the North Tower, and St. John Baptist in the South, and he also took into it the Cemetery Chapel of St. Edmund. During his term of office, the cloisters were nearly finished, and he designed the magnificent screen, which is described as the glory of the Western front. In the thickness of the latter, he constructed the chauntry of St. Rhadegund, where he was interred in the year 1365. His successor, Bishop Brantyngham, finished the cloisters, perhaps erected the jube or rood-loft, and inserted the present East window. During Bishop Lacey's time, the extremity of the South transept was enlarged and modernized, the interior being subsequently gilded and painted. Bishop Lacey erected the upper portion of the Chapter House, between the years 1427 and 1439, its great East window being attributed to Bishop Nevyll, and its beautifully decorated ceiling to Bishop Bothe, who is also credited with having raised the episcopal throne. During the episcopate of Bishop Courtenay, the upper storey of the North tower was"], [221, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 175 erected ; and the chauntries of St. George and St. Saviour were founded about the year 15 18. The acts of desecra tion committed in the Cathedral during the commonwealth period have been already described. At the Restoration Dean (afterwards Bishop) Ward first turned out the buyers and sellers from the building; then caused the partition which the Parliamentary part} had erected in the nave to be pulled down, and afterwards repaired and beautified the edifice, the expenses amounting to twenty-five thousand pounds. During the Protectorate, a row of small houses was built against the Chapter House, and others between the buttresses of the nave. Those in front of the Chapter House were removed in 1813, and those against the nave in 1817. The year following a new altar screen was erected ; the Lady Chapel was restored in 1832 ; and the pews in the nave (which had an unsightly appearance) were removed in 1834. The Cathedral was restored, and a reredos, added in 1879. The early history of our grand old Guildhall is shrouded in mystery. Tradition has it that the ancient Pr\u00e6torium of the City was situated in Waterbeer Street, where many years ago an ancient Saxon building was standing. The present Guildhall was originally a chapel dedicated to St. George, and it was probably appropriated for judicial purposes about the year 1330, when we first have definite mention of it in history. It has been several times subsequently rebuilt, and has undergone improvement and alterations from time to time. Concerning the exact date of the building of Rouge-"], [222, "176 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. mont Castle, historians are doubtful ; but in all probability, Athelstan was the founder, the structure being raised on a site which was in more ancient times probably an effective earthwork defence. If, however, after the conquest the structure was not entirely rebuilt, it was probably so altered as to be more thoroughly in accord with the Norman idea of what the vulnerability of such a fortress should be. There are remaining strong indications of Norman work in the building.* Formerly the chapel stood in the court yard near the Western corner. In addition to the chapel, there were undoubtedly in earlier times other buildings ; there must have been, of necessity, a hall, kitchen, stabling, lodgings, barracks, etc., and probably most of these stood on or near the Assize Courts.! The County Prison (within the Castle) and the City prison at Southgate were both in a wretched state ; and the condition of the former may be gathered from our comments thereon in a previous page. In 1787 an Act of Parliament was obtained for erecting a new gaol on the site of the present prison. Subsequently the House of Correction and the Debtor's Ward were placed under the jurisdiction of one governor ; and in 1853 the prison was rebuilt and opened under the \"silent\" system. The City Prison, which Howard, the Philanphropist, described as one of the most unwholesome and most dismal places he had ever seen, was demolished with the rest of Southgate in 1819, the inmates being removed to * The Conqueror on entering the City is said to have altered the Castle Gates, (or the purpose of commemorating his conquest. t See remarks in previous chapter."], [223, "CITY PR/<?o/V"], [224, ""], [225, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 177 a new prison built on the site of Rougemont Hotel, and of which we give an illustration. In 1863 the prisoners were transferred to the County gaol ; the City prison was demolished, and on the site that magnificent building, the Rougemont Hotel (as previously indicated), has been erected. Before the building of the County prison in 1790-4, the common place of execution for the County was a spot (Ringwell) about a couple of miles out ofthe City, and still known as \" Heavitree gallows.\" Here, on one occasion, six persons (four women and two men) were hanged, they being taken through Heavitree in carts, each sitting on a coffin. They were buried in ground adjoining the gallows. When the Gaol was built a temporary platform and gallows were erected for the purpose of executions. In Magdalen Road (on a site at present occupied by the Skating Rink), a temporary gallows was put up, and here Homeyard was executed for forgery on November 13th, 1818, he being the first person hanged by the City authorities for over thirty years. He rode to the place of execution in a cart, beside his own coffin, and the clergyman walked at his side. The scenes at the public executions were of a disgusting type, people crowding into the City from country places, in all kinds of vehicles, and as though on some holiday bent. As early as six o'clock in the morning persons would begin to take up their positions in every available space in view of the gallows, the throng increasing in dimensions and disorder the hour of execution approached. On these occasions the vendors of \" last dying speeches M"], [226, "178 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. and confessions \" plied a lucrative trade ; and to the morbid-minded there seemed plenty of food for enjoy ment. The last execution in public in Exeter was on March 28th, 1866, when Mary Ann Ashford, aged 41 years, of Honiton Clyst, suffered the extreme penalty of the law, for poisoning her husband. A sad story attaches to her crime. The unhappy woman at the age of 40 had cherished a guilty passion for one of her husband's apprentices (eighteen years of age), named Pratt. On discovery of the improper feelings existing between Pratt and Mrs. Ashford, the husband of the latter sent the youth adrift. Subsequently (in 1865) he was taken back at the solicitation of Mrs. Ashford ; but, in the meantime, Pratt's feelings had become changed, he being then engaged to a young woman, whom he afterwards married. The miserable woman Ashford, thought, however, that the removal of her husband, and the obtaining of the or which he had saved, would be the means of her winning back the affection of the stripling. With this object in view she slowly poisoned her husband, by the administration of repeated doses of arsenic and strychnine. The details of her execution are frightful, she having to be supported by two men whilst on the scaffold. The following extract from a report in a local paper* will suffice to shew the shocking character of the scene: \u2014 \"The drop was overlaid by two or three strong boards, * The Devon Weekly Times"], [227, "POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. 179 stretched across the gallows, and on these two officers stood above the culprit, holding her up, when Calcraft stepped aside to carry out his last dreadful duty. The disappearance of the executioner, with his long grey beard, sent a thrill of horror through the spectators. A moment's terrible suspense followed ; and then, at a signal from Calcraft, the men simultaneously dropped the body ; the crash and thud of the drop broke the dead silence which reigned in every part of the crowd, and the culprit fell through the trap. A most sickening scene followed ; bound hand and foot as she was, the helpless wretch now manifested a strange strength and nerve. Instead of dying in a swoon as many supposed she would, she was manifestly perfectly conscious of her position ; and instantly after she swung herself round and grasped at the plank stretched across the gallows. This was instantly withdrawn, but still the convict struggled in the air \u2014 jerking herself up ; and for two minutes her contortions continued. Then the vibra tions began to decrease, and in another moment all was over.\" Among the more notable of the executions on the drop outside the County gaol was that of Thomas Oliver alias Buckingham Joe (in 1836), who, with Edward Galley, was convicted of the murder of Mr. May, on the Dunsford Road. Several people who heard the trial were convinced of Galley's innocence, and by their exertions they obtained a reprieve for the unfortunate man. Oliver, both at the trial and on the gallows, asserted the innocence of Galley. The latter was sent to the convict establish-"], [228, "180 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. ment at Woolwich. In 1880, after having served over 40 years as a convict, he was proved innocent, and obtained a \" free pardon,\" together with a government grant of The last occupant of the condemned cell at the County gaol was John Lee, who was convicted of cruelly murdering, and afterwards attempting to burn the body of, his mistress, Miss Keyse, who resided at the Glen, Babbacombe (Torquay), in the autumn of 1884. The trial of Lee occupied three days, and the case created great sensation, not only in the City and Devonshire, but throughout the whole country. Monday, February 23rd, 1885, was fixed as the day of Lee's death; and on that morning, one of the most shocking scenes ever- witnessed on a scaffold was enacted. No less than three unsuccessful attempts were made to carry the dread sentence of the law into effect ; but the machinery of the gallows refused to work. Finding this state of things to exist, the Under-Sheriff (Mr. Henry James) ordered the execution to be postponed. He repaired the same day to London and communicated with Sir William Harcourt (the Home Secretary). At the instance of that gentleman, Lee was respited; and his sentence was subsequently commuted to penal servi tude for life. In the opinion of the medical men who were present, Lee, in the fearful ordeal he went through, suffered the agonies of death over and over again. The holding of the Assizes, which sometimes lasted ten days, created in former years a great stir in the City, the streets being thronged with people night and day. A"], [229, ""], [230, ""], [231, "181 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER. large amount of business was done, the theatre was opened, and other amusements'vvere provided. A ball and private parties were held during Assize week. The Judge's lodgings -were at Mr. Carter's, in High Street, in what is now Messrs. Green's show-room, and which is said to be one of the handsomest rooms in Exeter. The Judges were escorted into the City by a procession, headed by a party of javelin men (generally the Sheriff's labourers) who were commanded by the noted Captain Cook,* an eccentric citizen, who carried on'the business of a saddler at the shop at present in the occupation of Mr. Damerel, in High Street. Following the Sheriff's carriage, there were frequently numbers of tradesmen on horseback, and often the tenantry of the Sheriff attended, as many as 200 persons being sometimes in the procession. When the Judges were leaving the City en route to Corn wall, they were escorted to St. John's Cross, St. Thomas, by Captain Cook, mounted, and dressed in a scarlet coat, cocked hat, and coloured breeches. * See Illustration."], [232, "182 POPULAR HISTORY OF EXETER.

There was not a good or useful movement in Exeter that had not Dr. Temple's earnest and hearty support ; friends of the temperance cause especially miss both the worthy prelate and Mrs. Temple. In his elevation, however, he carries with him the hearty congratulations of Exonians ; and it is gratifying to be able to note, that in Dr. Bickersteth, we have a worthy successor to the See.
