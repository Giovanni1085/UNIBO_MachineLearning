The Author of the present manual Las proposed as his primary object to draw a sketch, complete and comprehen sive in outline without being overloaded with detail, of the whole province of geographical science together with its various points of contact with other branches of science and knowledge. The student will, it is hoped, derive from a perusal of the work a fair idea of the general scope and range of the subject, however imperfect may be his acquaintance with its details. The Author has further endeavoured, by the selection and treatment of his materials, and by the numerous illustrations intro duced into the pages, to redeem the study of elementary geography from the imputation of tediousness currently attached to it. The introductory chapters are devoted to the more scientific portions of the subject, \u2014 Mathematical and Physical Geography. These are treated in a simple and elementary manner ; and the various topics thus intro duced are illustrated by maps and diagrams. Consider able attention is paid in this portion of the work to Geographical Terminology ; and a brief exposition of the leading principles of Cartography will be found under the head of Mathematical Geography. The body of the work is occupied with Descriptive Geography, and here the following features may be noticed : \u2014 mod. geo. 6"], [10, "VI PREFACE. (1) The History of Geographical Discovery is carried on from the point where it is left in the ' Student's Manual of Ancient Geography ' down to the present day. (2) The progressive steps by which the great states of the world have arrived at their present position are sum marized under the head of Historical Geography, prefixed to the description of each state. (3 j The influence of Geographical Position on the poli tical and commercial fortunes of a country is occasionally brought prominently before the student's notice. (4) Under the head of Military Geography will be found notices of the various points of attack and defence on the frontiers of the great military nations of Europe. The events of military history are noticed among other topics under the head of Historical Associations. (5) The Coast-lines and Harbours are described at some length, inasmuch as they form a most important element in the commercial capabilities of a country. (6) Attention is drawn to the significance of names in cases where they illustrate points of historical or geogra phical interest. (7) Maps are occasionally introduced in illustration of Physical and Military Geography. These are designed to supplement, not to supersede, the use of the ordinary atlas in the study of the book. The other Illustrations have been selected with care, as characteristic either of the physical features of the globe, or of its great political and commercial centres, and are not to be looked upon as mere pictures. (8) General rules are given for the pronunciation of foreign names, and accents are affixed to the individual names wherever they have been deemed necessary.

The distinction above noticed is marked by a change in the type. Bare lists of names are avoided as much as possible in the descriptive paragraphs, and are thrown into a tabulated form for the purpose of reference. In respect to the proportionate space assigned to the various countries, the only noticeable point is that the United States are described at greater length than has hitherto been customary in works of this size. The lively interest aroused by the late Civil War, and the numerous links that bind us to that great country, appear to justify this departure from previous custom.

Definition and Divisions of Geography. \u2014 The term Geography is derived from a Greek word {ytwypafy'ia), which was applied both to verbal and pictorial descriptions of the earth, iu other words, to trea tises and maps. The modern term is restricted to the former of these senses as being the moat important, and maps are regarded merely aa auxiliary to Geography. The classical definition of the term is hardly precise enough for the requirements of modern science, inasmuch as a \" description of the earth,\" in its widest sense, would include almost the whole range of the physical sciences. Geography regards the earth as the platform on which man lives and moves, and, without entering into the theory of such sciences as Astronomy, Botany, Zoology, &c., it culls from them such facts as bear on the interests or sustenance of man. Geography may therefore be defined to be a description of the earth as the abode of man. The topics which form its subject-matter may be conveniently classified under the three heads of Mathematical, Physical, and Descriptive Geography. I. Mathematical Geography includes all such matters as are derived from the Mathematical sciences, and particularly from Astronomy and Geometry. It deals (1) with the planetary relations of the earth, such as its position in the Universe, its size, form, and movements ; and (2; with the methods by which its surface may be represented. This branch of Geography might otherwise be described as Cosmography. II. Physical Geography deals with the natural history of the earth's surface. It discusses such phenomena as the distribution of land and water, climate, volcanic agency, the animal and vegetable kingdoms, &c, examining into the causes and effects of each. HI. Descriptive Geography takes as its basis the political divisions of the earth, and gives a general survey of the various countries \u2014 their physical features, productions, climate, inhabitants, towns, &c. It MOD. GEO. B"], [18, "MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAWIY. ISTBon 2 includes what is termed Political Geography, but goes beyond it, inas much as it interweaves the purely political with the physical aspect of each country. I.\u2014 MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY. \u00a7 2. Definition of Terms.\u2014 Mathematical Geography involves the use of certain terms of a scientific character, borrowed chiefly from Astro nomy and Geometry. The following need explanation : \u2014 _ Sphere, a body terminated by a curved surface, every point of which is equidistant from a point inside it, named its centre. Spheroid, a body approximating to a sphere, but not a perfect sphere. Axis of a sphere, an imaginary line, passing through its centre, upon which it rotates or may rotate. Poles, the extremities of the axis. Diameter, a straight line passing through the centre of a curved figure, and terminated at both ends by the sides of the figure. Plane, an imaginary level surface, bounded by a circle described on a sphere. Ellipse, a figure of an oval shape, formed by the intersection of a cone by a plane passing obliquely through both sides of it Horizon, in the ordinary sense of the term, the circle which bounds the view of the earth's surface to a spectator on a level surface, such as a plain or the sea. This is termed the sensible horizon. The rational horizoD is a circle parallel to the visible horizon, with a plane passing through the earth's centre, and extended to the celestial sphere, which is thus divided into hemispheres, one of which is upper and visible, the other lower and invisible. In the expression ' ' plane of the horizon \" the rational horizon is understood.

FIGURE AND DIMENSIONS OF THE EARTH. the sun, at a distance from it of 91,328,600 miles; and the fourth place in point of size, being larger than Venus, Mars, and Mercury, and smaller than Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus. The earth has one satellite, the Moon, which revolves about it at a mean distance of 237,360 miles, and exercises, from its proximity, a powerful attracting influence on the waters of the earth, which we shall presently notice under the head of Tides. The moon effects its revolution round the earth in 27 d. 7 h. 43 m. 4'7 s., and so gives rise to the period of a lunar month. In the course of its revolution it occasionally comes between the earth and the sun, and occasionally has the earth between itself and the sun: in the former case an eclipse of the sun is caused by the passage of the moon across its disc, in the latter case an eclipse of the moon by the shadow of the earth falling on it. \u00a7 4. Figure and dimensions of the Earth. \u2014 That the earth is of a spherical, or, at all events, of a spheroidal form, is patent to the obser vation even of unscientific persons. The gradual appearance of a vessel above the horizon as she approaches the land \u2014 the possibility of a traveller returning to the spot whence he started by pursuing an undeviating course in one direction \u2014 the circular shadow which the earth throws upon the moon at the time of au eclipse \u2014 these are among the elementary proofs which show that the earth must either be a sphere, or very nearly a sphere. Its exact form can only be ascer tained by measurements and calculations of great precision, and is a subj'ect which still engages the attention of scientific men. Assuming that the earth rotates on its axis, and that its materials are, or once were, of a plastic or fluid character, it might be inferred a priori that the earth would bulge towards the equator, because the centrifugal force would naturally be greater there than elsewhere. And this is proved by observation to be the case : the oscillations of a pendulum of a given length become more rapid as it is conveyed from the equator towards either pole, proving that the force of gravity is increased, and consequently that the poles are nearer the earth's centre than the equator is. The measure ment of the arcs of a meridian under different parallels fur nishes another proof of the same fact : for it is found that the length of a degree of a meridian increases as the poles are ap proached,and consequently that the earth's surface must be flatter in that direction than elsewhere. The earth may there fore be defined to be a spheroid of revolution, and as the depres sion or flattening occurs at the poles, just as in an orange, it would be described in mathe matical language as an oblate Fig. 1. spheroid, in contradistinction to a prolate spheroid, or one which resembles an egg in being drawn out in the direction of the axis. The accompanying figure represents such a spheroid, A A' being the axis upon which the body revolves in the direction indicated by the dotted lines, and E E' a line intersecting it midway at right angles, B 2"], [20, "Introd. 4 MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY. and having a greater length than A A'. The two lines A A' and B E' represent in the earth the Polar and the Equatorial diameters respectively, but the proportionate difference in length of these is less than is represented in the figure, the Polar diameter having a length of about 7899'142 m.,1 and the Equatorial diameter ot 7925-626 m., the difference being only 26J m., and the degree ot ellipticity consequently about _^5. The circumference at the equator is 24,899 m., and at the poles 24,815 m., giving as the mean 24,857 m. The total area is estimated at 196,663,000 sq. m., and the solid contents at 260,000 millions of cubic miles. Whether the earth is a perfect sphere at the equator is perhaps doubtful : from the measurements of arcs of meridians it has been surmised that the equatorial diameters are not equal at all points. \u00a7 5. Motions of the Earth. \u2014 The earth has a double motion\u2014 a motion of rotation upon its axis, and a motion of translation about the sun. Both of these motions are in the direction of W. to E. The earth completes a revolution of the former kind in a day of 24 hours, and of the latter kind in a year of 365 d. 5 h. 48 m. 49-7 s. The rate of its daily motion varies in different parts of its surface from a maximum of about 1000 miles an hour at the equator to nil at the poles : for as the earth is 24,899 m. round at the former point, and makes a complete revolution in 24 hours, its velocity exceeds 1000 m. per hour ; from thence its circumference, and consequently its rate oi motion, diminishes with each succeeding parallel, until the poles are reached where the circumference resolves itself into a point. The rate of its annual motion round the sun may be put roughly at 1140 m. per minute; for it completes its orbit of nearly 600 millions of miles in 365 days, from which the above result may be ob tained : the rate varies at dif ferent periods of its revolution, being greatest when the earth approximates nearest to the sun. The effects of this yearly revolution cannot be estimated without taking into considera tion the position, or rather the posture, of the earth in reference to the sun. The axis of the earth is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, but in clined towards it at an angle of about 23^ degrees (exactly 23\u00b0 27' 28-75\"), as shown in Fig. 2, where A A' represents its axis, B C D E the equator, Fig. 2. F C G E the plane of the earth's orbit, or the ecliptic, and H I a line perpendicular to that plane.

MOTIONS OF THE EARTH. 5 forms an angle of 23J\u00b0 with H I, and B C D E does the same with F C G E. As the earth never varies its posture, its axis always retaining the same direction, the result is that different parts of the earth's surface are brought more directly under the sun's influence at different periods of the earth's revolution : in other words, the variations of the seasons are produced by the combined effects of the inclination of the earth's axis and its revolution round the sun. This will be made clearer by reference to Fig. 3, where S represents the sun, and E the earth at four different Fig. 3. stages of its revolution, with A A in each case for its axis. Nos. 1 and 3 represent the position of the earth on the 21st of March and the 23rd of September, when the northern and southern hemispheres have an equal share of the sun's presence, and day and night are of the same length throughout the world. No. 2 exhibits the earth's position on the 21st of June, when the northern hemisphere has an excess and the southern a deficiency of the sun's presence : in the former it is summer, in the latter winter. No. 4 represents the position on the 21st of December, when the cases are reversed; the southern has au excess, and the northern a deficiency : it is summer in the former and winter in the latter. \u00a7 6. Correspondence between the Terrestrial and Celestial Spheres. \u2014 The Egovements of the earth are faithfully represented in the aspect of the heavenly bodies. The terrestrial sphere is to all appearance en cased in a celestial sphere, and each spot on the former has, at a given moment, its corresponding position on the latter. The earth's diurnal revolution from west to east produces the apparent movement of the sun from east to west, and of the stars about the point which answers to the eai'th's axis : and its annual revolution, combined with the incli nation of its axis, produces the apparent movement of the sun to the north and south of the equator in the path of the ecliptic. It is evident that the apparent movements of the celestial bodies of which we are conscious may be used as an index of the real movements of the earth of which we are not otherwise conscious, and that the conditions of time aud space which belong to the one may be transferred to the other. If, for instance, the sun or a certain star appear at one spot to be higher in the heavens than at another (in other words to have a different altitude), it is an indication of a proportionate difference of position between those spots ; and a measurement of the difference"], [22, "MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY. Introd. 6 of altitude supplies a basis for calculating the difference of position on the earth's surface. If, again, an observer were to take a point in the heavens representing a certain point on the earth\u2014 such, for instance, as the point which stands opposite to the earth's axis,\u2014 and were to ob serve the position in the heavens corresponding to the spot on which he stands, he might ascertain what portion of the celestial sphere, and consequently what portion of the terrestrial sphere, intervenes between those points : this portion he may further express in miles, from his knowledge of the dimensions of the sphere with which he is dealing. Again, as the sun appears to revolve round the earth in 24 hours, it is easily ascertained how much of the earth's circle it traverses in each hour and each minute : time and space thus become convertible into each other, so that if we know the interval of time occupied by the sun in his passage from spot to spot we may calculate the space on the earth's sphere, or, vice versa, if we know the space, we may calculate the time. \u00a7 7. Meridians and Parallels.\u2014 As the earth is of a spherical form, the most obvious method of dividing and subdividing its surface is by imaginary lines drawn round it in different directions. As suming as the basis of our ope rations the axis of the earth, we may draw circles from any point on it with a radius re volving in a plane at right angles to it. Thus, in Fig. 4, from the points B and C in the axis A A' the circles E G H I and D K L M are drawn with the radii B E and C D. Or, again, from a single point in the axis, viz. the centre, circles may be drawn in the plane of the axis ; as from C with the radii C F and C N are drawn the circles F A L K and N A' 0 A. Any circles -drawn from the earth's centre are termed great circles, and will divide the world Kig. 4. into two equal portions or Jiemispheres. Circles drawn from any other point than the centre, as from B, are termed small circles. There can be but one great circle in the plane perpendicular to the earth's axis, but there may be any number of small circles in planes parallel to it : the one great circle is named the equator, E E' in Fig. 5, from the Latin \u00e6quator, because when the sun is vertical on this line day and night are equalized over the earth ; the rest are termed parallels. There may be any number of great circles in the plane of the axis, and these are termed meridians, from meridies, \" midday,\" because when the sun is opposite spots intersected by such lines it is midday. Each meridian cute each parallel at right angles, and the multiplication of meridians aud parallels breaks up the surface of the globe into compartments approaching in form to squares, but in reality trapeziums, inasmuch as tlie meridians converge towards each other in the direction of the poles. I be number of such imaginary lines might be multiplied indefinitely, but as every circle is supposed to be divisible into 360 degrees, the"], [23, "Ciup. i. LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE. 7 meridians and parallels drawn on maps and globes represent a certain number or certain aliquot parts of these degrees. Thus, in Fig. 5, representing a hemisphere, the semi-equator EE' is supposed to be divided into 180 parts, and the circle passing through the poles N. P. S. P. into 360 parts. Lines are drawn from N. P. to S. P. through the Fig. s, points marked on the equator, and are there distinguished by numbers ; and other lines, drawn from point to point on the circumference, are similarly distinguished. The meridians or lines drawn from pole to pole serve to mark the longit'de of a place, or its distance in degrees E. or W. from some fixed point, as Greenwich or Paris. The parallels serve to mark the latitude, or the distance in degrees N. or S. of the equator. The length of a degree of latitude increases slightly from the equator to the poles in consequence of the earth's ellipticity, its mean length in the torrid zone being about 68-7 statute m., in the temperate zone 69 m., and in the frigid zone 69'3 m. The length of a degree of longitude diminishes in proportion to the distance from the equator, inasmuch as the meridians approximate each other, so that in lat. 60\u00b0 a degree of longitude is worth only half the value in miles that it has at the equator. Each degree is divided into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds, and these three denominations are usually described by the following signs :\u2014 \u00b0 for degrees ; ' for minutes ; and \" for seconds. The degree of the equator is further divided into 60 geo graphical miles, one of which thus equals a minute of the equator.^ The value in statute miles of a geographical mile cannot be decided without reference to the earth's equatorial circumference. Taking this at 24-899 miles, 60 geog. m. will equal 69-164 statute m., and the value of a single geog. m. will be V152 statute m., or 2028-8 yards. \u00a7 8 Methods of ascertaining Latitude and Longitude.\u2014 the simplest methods of ascertaining the latitude are\u2014 (1) by observing the distance intervening between the zenith (i. e. the spot in the heavens exactly"], [24, "Introd. MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY. 8 over the observer) and the pole; or (2) by observing the altitude of one of the celestial bodies above the horizon at midday, allowance being made for the declination (i. e. the distance in degrees of the body from the plane of the equator). And the simplest methods of determining the longitude are\u2014 (1) by noting the interval of time between the meridian passage of one of the celestial bodies at Green wich and at the place of observation, the former being known by a chronometer set to Greenwich time, aud the latter by observation of the moment when that body is on the meridian ; (2) by noting the time of the day when an eclipse either of the sun or moon, or of one of Jupiter's satellites, or the occultation of a star by the moon takes place, and then comparing the time when the same occurrence is visible at Greenwich, as ascertained from tables ; or (3) by observing the time at which the moon attains a certain position relatively to a certain one of the celestial bodies, and ascertaining from tables prepared for the purpose the time of the day when it is seen in that position at Greenwich. All these modes of ascertaining the longitude are based upon one principle, to which attention has been drawn in a preceding paragraph (\u00a7 6), viz., that intervals of time are readily convertible into intervals of space in consequence of the earth's rotation on its axis. \u00a7 9. Ecliptic, Tropics, and Zones. \u2014 In addition to the lines of latitude and longitude, which are of a purely conventional origin, there are others whose position is decided by physical facts. (1) The Ecliptic is a great circle (A B', Fig. 6) mark ing the sun's apparent path in the heavens. From the inclination of the earth's axis, this circle crosses the equator obliquely at an angle of 23J\u00b0. The points of intersection are called the equinoctial points, because when the sun is at these points day and night are of equal length. The ecliptic is so named because eclipses can only occur when the moon is on or very near the plane of that circle. (2) The Tropics are two lines (A A', Fig. 6. B B') running parallel to the equator at a distance of 23J degrees north and south of it, marking the extreme points which the sun's apparent path reaches in those directions, and consequently the turning points (as the name ' \u25a0 tropic\" implies) of his course : the northern (B B') is termed the Tropic of Cancer, the southern (A A') the Tropic of Capricorn, from the signs of the Zodiac, wherein these turning-points are apparently fixed. (3) The Arctic and Antarctic Circles (CC', DD') are situated respectively 23J degrees from the north and south poles. They mark the limits reached by the sun's rays as it stands over the equator at the time of the equinoxes, as well as the limits of the spaces which are alternately subject to light and darkness, according as the sun moves away from the equator to the north or to the south. The four circles last men tioned serve the further purpose of fixing the limits of the Zones or' \" belts,\" as the term means, of temperature, of which there are five, viz.: \u2014the Torrid, between the tropics ; the North Temperate, between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle ; the South Template, between the Iropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle : the North Frigid,"], [25, "Chap. I. GLOBES AND MAPS. 9 north of the Artie Circle ; and the South Frigid, south of the Antarctic Circle. The Torrid Zone has a breadth of 3219 m. and a superficial area of 78,314,300 sq. m. ; the Temperate Zones, each a breadth of 2969 m., and an area of 51,041,500 sq. m. ; and the Frigid Zones, each a breadth of 1625 m., and an area of 8,132,810 sq. m. \u00a7 10. Globes and Maps. \u2014 The earth's surface may be represented to the eye either by a globe or by a map. The former is the most perfect representation, inasmuch as the spherical form of the earth is preserved ; but globes are costly and inconvenient, and could not possibly be made of sufficient size to represent a country on a large scale. Their chief use is to work out certain elementary problems, such as finding the distance, or the difference of time between two places, the value of a degree of longitude, and other questions of the sort. Maps are not only cheaper and more portable than globes, but they possess the great advantage that they allow of an infinite subdivision of the earth's surface, so that any portion of it may be represented on such a scale as may be re quired. But maps are not altogether faithful representations of the earth's surface : it is impossible to transfer a spherical to a plane sur face without producing in some part or other either a disproportion in the size of the areas or a distortion of their outlines. Various methods have been devised with a view either to reduce as far as possible the error incidental to the process, or to throw the representation into such a form as may be practically convenient. These processes are termed projections (from the Ladn projectio), because lines are supposed to be thrown forward from the spherical to the plane surface. The projec tions in use may be divided into two classes, according as they are based ( 1 ) on perspective principles, in which case the spherical surface is depicted as it appears to the eye of an observer ; or (2) on a principle of development, in which caBe the sphere is supposed to be unrolled and forced to assume a quadrangular shape. Of perspective projections we shall notice three kinds, viz.: \u2014 the Orthographic, the Stereographic, and the Globular, omitting the Gnomonic as being more applicable to celestial than terrestrial maps ; and of development projections, two kinds, viz. : \u2014 the Conical and the Cylindrical. It may serve to eluci date the subject if we state beforehand that most atlases exhibit some two or three, if not more, of these projections. The map of the World is generally given in two forms, viz. \u2014 in hemispheres, aud in Mercator's projection : the former furnishes an instance of a perspective pro jection, most frequently of the Globular kind, while Mercator's is a projection on the development principle. The maps of the separate continents and countries are usually conical projections, exceptions being made in respect to Africa and South America, which, as lying on both sides of the equator, do not admit of the conical treatment. ' \u00a7 11. Perspective Projections. \u2014 In perspective projections the earth must be regarded as a transparent globe, through which an observer looks and notes the position of the various objects which he sees on the side opposite to or farthest from him. The difference in perspective projections arises from the difference of position which the observer assumes as his post of observation, or, as it is technically termed, his point of projection. In the Orthographic, the observer is supposed to be placed at an immeasurable distance from the globe, so that the divergence of the rays of sight is obliterated, and they fall in parallel lines. In the Stereographic, the eye of the observer is placed on the surface of the globe ; and in the Globular at a certain fixed distance outside the globe. In each of these projections the observer may select b 3"], [26, "MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY. Introd. 10 any portion of the globe that he wishes, placing his eye over the centre of that portion. If he takes into view a hemisphere , the plane of projection will coincide with a great circle of the globe. This great circle varies according to the position that the spectator occupies; if, for instance, the eye is placed in a line with the axis of the earth, the great circle will fall on the Equator, and the map is said to be projected on the plane ofthe Equator. If the eye be on the plane of the equator, then the great circle will co incide with a meridian passing through the poles, and the map is said to be projected on the plane of a meridian. If, on the other hand, the eye be opposite to a place in neither of the above positions (say London), then the great circle will co incide with the rational horizon of that spot, and the map is said to be projected on the plane of the horizon of that place. \u00a7 12. Orthographic Projec tion. \u2014 We may illustrate the principles on which these pro jections are based, together with the defects and advantages of each, by a reference to the following diagrams : \u2014 In Fig. 7 the principle of the orthogra phic projection is exhibited. Fig. T Fig.e."], [27, "Chap. I. PROJECTIONS. 11 In this the visual rays, represented by the dotted lines, impinge at right angles on the plane of projection A G ; whence the name orthographic from the Greek opB6s, \" straight,\" and -ypdupu, \" I describe.\" In this case the point B on the globe will be projected on the plane at 6, C at e. D at d, and so forth. But whereas the spaces on the globe A B, B C, and C D, are equal, the spaces on the map Ab, b c, and c d, are unequal, and consequently this projection fails to give areas of proportionate size. The result is exhibited in Fig. 8, where the meridians gradually approximate each other on the equator from the centre to the circumference of the map, and consequently the areas in the latter direction are unduly cramped. This projection has, however, the advantage that the parallels of latitude are straight Hues, and thus are parallel on the map as well as on the globe. \u00a7 13. Stereographic1 Projec tion. \u2014 Fig. 9 represents the principle of the stereographic projection. The eye of the spectator is supposed to be at S, and the visual rays are re presented by the dotted lines Fig. 9. Tig. 10. 1 The term stereographic- is derived from the Greek o-repeo-r \"solid\" and ypa.<fxn 'J describe,\" and implies simply the delineation of a solid body on a plane according to geometrical principles. Its specific sense in map-drawing is conventional."], [28, "12 MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY. Introd, Fig. 12. S A, S B, S C, &c. It is clear that the points on the surface of the globe A, B, C, D, E, F, will be represented by b, c, d, e, f, on the plane o projection A G. Here again is a disproportion between the spaces on the globe A B, B C, &c, and the spaces on the map A b, be, &c; for whereas the former are equal, the latter increase as they approach the circumference. The result is exhibited in Fig. 10, and it will be observed that in this case the areas in the centre of the map are unduly cramped as compared with those near the circumference. This pro jection has, however, the ad vantage that the meridians and parallels intersect each other at right angles, and con sequently the distortion in the forms of the countries is less than in the orthographic. \u00a7 14. Globular Projection.\u2014 The globular projection aims at correcting the defects of the two already described, by find ing an intermediate spot for the eye, whence the areas shall appear in their due propor tions. In Fig. 11 this spot is assumed to be at a point S, distant from the surface of the globe a space equal to the sine Fig. 11"], [29, "Chap. I. PROJECTIONS. 13 H I of an angle of 45\u00b0, or, in other words, equal to parts of the diameter. The visual rays represented by the dotted lines bring the points on the globe B, C, D, E, F, to the points b, c, d, e, f, on the plane of projection A G, and it will be found that the spaces Ab, be, cd, de, are very nearly equal to each other, and consequently represent with greater correctness than heretofore the spaces AB, B C, C D, &c, on the globe. The great defect in this projection is, that the meridians do not intersect the parallels at right angles, but at a constantly increasing divergence as they approach the circumference. Fig. 12 represents a map of the hemisphere constructed on this principle. Some difference of opinion exists as to the exact point whence the globular projection may be most advantageously taken : assuming that the diameter is divided into 200 parts, it has been proposed to make the distance out side the globe equal to 59J, instead of 70 such parts. The inequalities which Btill exist in the intervals of the meridians and parallels in a map constructed on a purely globular principle may be corrected me chanically, and then the projection is termed equidistant. This is the one usually employed in maps of hemispheres. \u00a7 15. Projection of two-thirds of the Globe.\u2014 Various methods have been suggested for the delineation of a larger amount of the earth's sur face than the hemisphere. None of these have come into general use, but it may not be uninteresting to describe the principle on which such a projec tion may be based. In Fig. 13 the eye of the spectator is supposed to be at a point, S, elevated half the earth's radius above the globe. The plane of projection A G is brought nearer to the eye than the great circle by 23^\u00b0. The visual rays which fall on the earth's surface at B, C, D, E, F, inter sect the plane of the projection at 6, c, d, e, and /. Consequently the amount of surface depicted on such a map equals 227\u00b0 out of the 360\u00b0 of which the whole sphere consists. \u00a7 16. Conical Projection \u2014 We have Fig. 13 seen that the foregoing projections fail in reproducing with fidelity the forms of the countries as they exist on the globe. A greater degree of exactness is attained for portions of the earth's surface by a system of development, based on the assumption that the spherical surface may be treated as if it were conical. Thus in Fig. 14 the portion of the sphere included between the lines A B and E F may be regarded as the portion of a cone H G I circumscribed about it, and touching it at its mid points C and D. In this case the parallel C D will be the arc of a circle drawn with the radius G K, and the position of places on this parallel will exactly coincide with that which they hold on the globe. There will be a de viation from this precision on each side of the central parallel, as at A B and E F ; and this deviation may be considerably diminished by regard ing the cone as inscribed instead of circumscribed, so as to touch the sphere at A and E instead of C, and at B and F instead of D. In this caie the conical coincides with the spherical surface at two points in-"], [30, "MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY. Introd. 14 stead of one, and consequently a greater degree of correctness is attained. The parallels on a conical projection are arcs of a circle of which the apex of the cone is the centre, and the meridians are either straight lines, as in Fi 15, or curved lines as in Fig. 16, also drawn from the apex. The important points in a conical projection are to discover (1) the true apex of the cone whence the parallels are to be drawn, and (2) the proportionate length of the degrees of longitude at each parallel. The first is attained by a ma thematical process: the side of a circum scribed cone being the cotangent of the central parallel, its numerical value can be ascertained from that of the parallel, and this multiplied by the number of degrees in the ra dius will give the Fig. 14. distance in degrees of latitude from the central parallel. Thus if the central parallel be 50\u00b0, its cotangent will be -839 ; and as there are 57-295\u00b0 in the radius, the distance will be 57-295 X *839 = 48\u00b0 4' 13\" as the distance from the central parallel to the apex. The length of a degree of longitude can be ascertained from a table. Fig. 15. Fig. 1G."], [31, "C Chap. 1 PROJECTIONS. 15 \u00a7 17. MercatcSs Projection. \u2014 The projection, of which Mercator is the reputed inventor, was devised especially for the use of the navigator. The other projections admit of a navigator laying down a straight course only in the direction of the cardinal points of the compass. For, inas much as the meridians approximate each other towards the poles, any intermediate course such as N.E. or S.W., instead of being straight, would become spiral, and would describe what is called a rhumb, or loxodromic curve, meaning a line which makes an equal angle with each successive meridian. To obviate this difficulty, it is necessary to make the meridians parallel straight lines, and this is effected by treating the Bphere as a cylinder, and regarding each meridian as carried up on a plane surface in a direction perpendicular to the equator. Of course in this case the proportions of the degrees of latitude and longitude can only be preserved by a gradual enlargement of the former as they ap proximate the poles, their relative conditions being reversed, so that instead of the degrees of latitude being of a uniform size, and those of longitude constantly diminishing, the latter are in Mercator's projection of a uniform size, and the former constantly increasing, as exhibited in Fig. 17, where the northern hemisphere is supposed to be depicted.

Distribution of Land and Water. \u2014 A glance at the map of the world will show that its surface is unequally divided between the elements of land and sea. To speak roundly, three-fourths of the earth's surface are occupied by sea, and only one-fourth by land : more exactly, the proportions are T7^ of the former to -fg^ of the latter; or, to put the statement into the form of a measurement, the sea covers 145,000,000, and the land 52,000,000 sq. m. But these figures, while they express the comparative areas, do not express the inequality in the distribu tion of the areas. A further examination will show that the northern hemisphere contains a larger proportion of land than the southern, the relative ratios of land and sea being in the former about as 3 to 5, in the latter as 1 to 6 : and, again, that the eastern hemisphere contains a larger amount of land than the western in the proportion of about 7 to 3. But the inequality of distribution may be still more re markably exhibited if we divide the world into north-western and south-eastern hemispheres, with the British isles and New Zealand for their respective centres : for thus it will appear that the former is mainly land, and the latter mainly sea; so much so, that we may term them respectively the continental and the oceanic hemispheres, Australia and a portion of South America being the only important masses of land in the latter. \u00a7 2. The Ocean. Definition of Terms. \u2014 The various bodies of water on the earth's surface may be classified under the two heads of Oceanic and Continental. The geographical terms connected with the former are as follows : \u2014 Ocean (a term derived immediately from the Greek uK\u20acav6s, hut supposed to be of Ph\u0153nician origin), the great world of water which separates the continents and receives their drainage. Sea (from the Saxon sae, or secge, \"a basin;\" compare the Biblical expression \" molten sea \"), applied without any very exact limitation1 to portions of the ocean contiguous to the continents, and more or less enclosed by land. 1 To the classical scholar we might illustrate the difference between \"ocean\" aid - sea by a reference to the Greek WAayos and fliw<ra ; the former meaning specifically tbe open sea, or that which is remote, comparatively speaking, from the land."], [33, "Chap. II. THE OCEAN. 17 Gulf (from the Greek kv\\is-6s, \"a cavity\"), a recess ofthe sea, both wide and deep. Bay (from the Saxon byge, \"bend\"), a recess, wide but not deep.5 Inlet, a recess on a small scale, and deep in comparison with its width. Fiord, a Scandinavian term for an inlet. Bight, connected etymologically with \" bay \" (compare the German, bucht), now generally applied to a small bay, but not so used in the case of the \" Bight of Benin.\" Channel (a variation of the word \" canal,\" from the Latin, canalis), a passage leading either from one portion of the sea to another, or from the sea to the mouth of a river. Firth (connected with the Scandinavian ford), a term peculiar2 to Scotland, where it is applied to estuaries and narrow channels. Strait (the same word as \" straight,\" but appropriated to the notion of narrowness rather than of directness), a narrow passage connecting two bodies of water. Sound (from the Saxon sund), a term sometimes used as strait for a narrow passage between two seas, sometimes as the Scotch firth for the estuary of a river. \u00a7 3. Divisions, depth, saltness, and colour of the Ocean. \u2014 The Ocean, though forming a continuous whole, is broken up by the intervening continents into certain large areas, which are also termed Oceans. Of these there are five: \u2014 (I) The Atlantic Ocean, between Europe and America, with an area of about 25,000,000 sq. m., sometimes divided into two parts, distinguished as the North Atlantic and South Atlantic. (2) The Pacific Ocean, between America and Asia, with an area of about 50,000,000 sq. m. It was named \"Pacific\" by the navigator Magalhaens, in consequence of the calm weather which he expe rienced in traversing it ; Balboa, who first discovered it, named it the \" South Sea,\" in reference to the Isthmus of Darien ; the modern Ger mans call it \"The Great Ocean.\" (3) The Indian Ocean, S. of Asia, and bounded W. by the meridian of Cape d'Agulhas, and E. by the islands Sumatra, Java, Timor, &c, and the continent of Australia ; its area is computed at 17,000,000 sq. m. (4) The Arctic Ocean, about the North Pole. (5) The Antarctic Ocean, about the South Pole. The areas of the two last oceans are not ascertained. The wide expanse of ocean that lies south of the continents is occasionally de signated the \" Southern Ocean.\" The Atlantic and Pacific are con nected with the Arctic, the former by a broad opening between Green land and Norway, the latter by a narrow channel, Behring Strait, between Asia and America. The bed of the ocean appears to be as much varied in form and elevation as the surface of the land ; it has its mountains and valleys, its plateaus and plains. The beds of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans differ very much in structure ; the former is a deep valley or chasm, the latter a depressed basin. The extreme depth of the Atlantic has never been ascertained, but it has been sounded to a depth of above 27,000 feet. If sections of it were made between Mexico and the coast of Africa, and again between Newfound land and Ireland, the former would exhibit a series of peaks of great 1 This distinction has not prevailed at all times, as instanced in Baffin's Bay and Hudson's Bay. substituted for firth, is referred to tbe Latin \"f return.\" We are inclined to be lieve firth to be the correct form, and frith a mere corruption 3 she term frith, which is occasionally"], [34, "PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. Ixtrod. 18 elevation rising from the bed of the ocean and appearing above its lovel in the islands of Cuba, Hayti, Teneriffe, &c. ; while the latter would show a comparatively level outline, which appears so singularly adapted to receive a telegraphic cable, that it has been termed \" The Telegraphic Plateau.\" The average depth of the ocean taken as a whole is supposed to be about 4 miles. The water of the sea is salt ; it is consequently less liable to freeze or evaporate, and has a greater specific gravity than fresh water in the mean proportion of 1-0275 to 1, The degree of saltness varies in proportion partly to the rainfall and partly to the amount of evaporation. The highest degree is attained in the region of the trade-winds where the evaporation is greatest. The South Atlantic is more saline than the North Atlantic, and the Atlantic than the Pacific. The sea generally bears a bluish-green tint: occa sionally, however, it assumes a different hue in consequence of the presence of plants or animalcul\u00e6 ; in the Gulf of Guinea, for instance, it is white ; about the Maldive islands, black. The temperature of the sea is to a great extent dependent, as far as the surface water is con cerned, on the temperature of the super-incumbent atmosphere : the lower strata exhibit, in extremely hot regions a gradually decreasing, and in extremely cold regions, a gradually increasing temperature, until at certain depths, varying with the latitude, a state of uniformity is attained. \u00a7 4. Tides and Waves. \u2014 The ocean is kept in motion by various agencies, the most important being the attractive power of the sun and moon, winds, and variations of temperature. To the first of these causes we owe tides ; to the second, waves ; to the third, combined with other co-operating agencies, cm-rents. The explanation of tides is this:\u2014 The moon and, in an inferior degree, the sun exercise an influence over the waters on the earth's surface, causing them to rise in a mass at the spot where either of those heavenly bodies happens to culminate. Should the sun and moon exercise a joint influence in the same meri dian, the result is a high or spring tide; should they, on the other hand, exercise an antagonistic influence, the result is a neap tide under the moon, whose attractive power is three times greater than that of the sun. The effect is reproduced on the opposite side of the earth, in asmuch as the earth itself is subjected to the attraction, and is drawn away, as it were, from the superincumbent water, which is thus heaped up on the opposite side of the earth, just as if it were under the direct influence of the heavenly bodies. The result is a double tide in each day, and a double spring or high tide in each lunar month. The great Southern Ocean, from its vast expanse, admits of the formation of a great tidal wave, which follows the moon in its westerly course, tra versing the ocean at the rate of 1000 miles an hour, until it comes in contact with shoals or continents, when its speed is retarded, its mass is broken up, and its course becomes irregular. The height of the tidal wave varies in different localities according to the degree in which the water is compressed between masses of land. In the Southern Ocean it is estimated at from 5 to 6 ft.; in the Atlantic 10 to 12 ft.; in the Bay of Fundy 50 ft. ; and in the Wye occasionally as high as 70 ft. Distinct from the tidal wave is the ordinary irregular motion of the sea, with which we are all familiar: this is the effect of wind, producing apparently a displacement of a body of water, but in reality a tem porary modification of its form, the only exception to this rule being witnessed in shoal water. Waves rarely exceed an elevation of 20 feet above the level of the sea, making with a corresponding depression"], [35, "Chap. II. OCEAN CURRENTS. 19 below the level a total elevation of about 40 feet ; waves of this eleva tion convey to the mind the impression of being \" mountains high.\" The rate at which they travel depends on their size, the depth of the water, and the violence of the wind. In 10 ft. of water the rate varies from about 2\\ ft. per second for a wave 1 ft. in breadth, to 18 ft. per second for one of 10,000,000 ft. in breadth ; and in 10,000 ft. of water, from 2J ft. to 567 ft. per second, for waves of the above breadths respectively. \u00a7 5. Currents. \u2014 Oceanic currents are of two kinds, some deep and unvarying, cleaving their way like a river through the mass of waters; others superficial, shifting, and liable to be affected by extraneous objects: the two kinds are sometimes distinguished as stream and drift currents. (1) Stream currents are generated by the copious evaporation which takes place within the tropical regions, and their courses are influenced by the rotatory movement of the earth. The effect of these agencies is as follows: \u2014 The heat of the sun within the tropics is constantly diminishing the bulk of water in those regions : the equi librium is thus disturbed, and is immediately restored by a rush of water from the Polar regions : hence the formation of a current which, but for the rotatory movement of the earth, would slowly flow towards the equator from the polar regions in a direct course. The earth's rotation has, however, a tendency to divert the current in the direction of its own movement, i. e. towards the E. And, if the rotatory velocity were equal in all parts of the earth's surface, the currents would have an easterly trending in their passage to the equator. But the rotatory velocity gradually increases from the poles to the equator (cap. 1, \u00a7 5), and the currents having contracted a slow movement in their early course, fail to acquire the full extent of the increase. They thus get a westerly instead of an easterly trending, and become south-west currents in the Northern, and north-west in 18. Chart of Ocean Currents."], [36, "PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. Introd. 20 the Southern Hemisphere. These currents are affected by coming iu contact with continents, by prevailing winds, by counter-currents, and various other modifying influences. (2) Drift currents arise from a variety of causes, such as strong winds, tides, and the melting of ice. Some of them set in periodically, others at irregular intervals. & 6. Stream Currents. \u2014 The following are the most marked stream currents : (1) The Arctic Current, which sets in southwards from the North Pole, both along the east coast of Greenland, and through Baffin's Bay, to Newfoundland, where, coming in contact with the Gulf Stream it divides and passes partly between that stream and the coast of the United States, and partly under it into the Caribbean Sea. (2) The Antarctic Current, which sets in northwards from the South Pole, and, under the influence of the prevailing westerly winds, acquires a general easterly direction: the South American continent diverts a portion of its waters northwards along the coasts of Chili and Peru, until they are merged in the great Equatorial Current. (3) The Great Equatorial Current, which, subject to the interruptions produced by masses of land, flows round the whole world in a westerly direction. This current originates probably in this way : \u2014 The currents that set in from the Poles, meeting at the equator, neutralise each other as far as their southerly and northerly tendencies are concerned, but agree in their westerly tendencies, and consequently combine their residual forces in that direction. The chief links in the great chain are the Equatorial Current of the Pacific, which crosses from America to China and the Indian Archipelago ; the Mosambique Current, between Madagascar and the mainland of Africa, which is produced by the general westerly set of the currents in the Indian Ocean ; the Cape Current, a continuation of the Mosambique Current round the Cape of Good Hope ; the South Atlantic Current, which after skirting the west coast of Africa for a while, strikes off westward in the direction of South America ; the Equatorial Current of the Atlantic, which crosses from Africa to America on the line of the Equator, emits in the Mid- Atlantic a branch, whose title, the North-West Branch Cur rent, sufficiently bespeaks its direction, while the main stream diverging somewhat to the south approaches^he protruding angle of Brazil, and there again bifurcates; one branch, under the title of the Guiana Cur rent, making for the Gulf of Mexico, while the other, the Brazil Current, runs southwards along the coast of Brazil. (4) Connected with the Equatorial Current just described is the Gulf Stream, which emanates from the Gulf of Mexico, where the waters of the Equatorial Current, compressed into a landlocked area, accumulate, and force for them selves a passage in the only direction where escape is possible, viz., towards the north-east, parallel to the coast of America so far north as Newfoundland; there, coming in contact with the Arctic Current, it turns to the east, bifurcates in the Mid-Atlantic, sending one branch towards the British Isles and Norway, and the other towards the Azores. The Guinea Current may be regarded as an offshoot of the Gulf Stream; it descends from the Mid- Atlantic southwards along the coast of Africa, and coming in contact with the Equatorial Current in the neighbour hood of Guinea, runs in a precisely opposite direction to it for about 1000 miles. (5) The Southern Connecting Current, which carries back the waters of the South Atlantic Cm-rent from the shores of South America to the neighbourhood of the Cape of Good Hope, keeping to the south of the Cape Current. (6) The Japan Current, which we may term the \"Gulf Stream\" of the Pacific, for it holds the same place"], [37, "Chap. II. GEOGRAPHICAL TERMS. 21 relative to the great Equatorial Current off the coast of Asia that the Gulf Stream holds in the Atlantic off that of America, sweeping round towards the north-east under the guiding influence of the continent and the Japanese islands, and traversing the Pacific to the west shores of North America. The beneficial effects of these Ocean currents are ma nifold, the most conspicuous being perhaps the modification of tempe rature produced by them (to which we shall presently advert), and the facilities they offer to navigation. Our review of the currents would not be complete without noticing the existence of under-currents run ning counter to the surface-currents, as from the Atlantic to the Arctic Ocean, and from the Mediterranean into the Atlantic through the Strait of Gibraltar. \u00a7 7. Definition of Terms relating to Land. \u2014 The geographical terms connected with land may be conveniently ranged under three heads, according as they refer (1) to the coast-line or contour; (2) to the elevation or vertical relief ; or (3) to the drainage of land. The first division embraces the following terms : \u2014 Continent (from the Latin continens, which was originally applied to the mainland adjacent to an island, aud was afterwards transferred to mainland generally), one of the great divisions of the world. It is generally considered essential to the definition of a continent, that it Bhould be wholly surrounded with water, in which sense there would be but two, or, at all events, three continents, viz., the Western Continent, comprising Europe, Asia, and Africa ; the Eastern Continent, or North and South America ; and Australia. In this work, however, it will be applied not only to these grand natural divisions, but also to the several great divisions 1 of the Eastern and Western Continents. Island (derived from the Saxon ie, or ea, \"water\" and land), a small mass of land, wholly surrounded by water. Archipelago (a term of doubtful etymology, supposed to be a cor ruption of the Greek name for the sea between Greece and Asia Minor. Alyatov irihayos), a large group of islands with the intervening sea. Peninsula (from the Latin pene, \"almost,\" and insula, \"island\"), a mass of land projecting into the sea, and so far surrounded by it as to bear an insulated appearance, and thus be, as the term implies, *' almost an island.'* Promontory (from the Latin pro, \"in advance,\" and mons, \"moun tain \"), a mountain jutting out prominently into the sea. Cape (from the Latin caput, \"head\"), the extreme point of a projecting piece of land, whether high, as in a promontory, or low : in the former case, it differs little or nothing from the Saxon equivalent headland, in the latter case, it answers to the term point It may be observed that cape, is almost exclusively used as a geographical prefix, just as the Latins used promontorium. Isthmus (from the Greek Ia0fi6st \"neck\"), a comparatively narrow neck of land, compressed between two seas, and connecting two portions of laud. * As the definition of \" continent \" above given ia at variance with the received usage of modern g<*>graphers, the following reasons are adduced in support of it :\u2014 (!) That the Latin term continens, when used in a geographical sense, invariably means what is adjacent (see Facciolati, *. \u00ab.). (2) That the analogy of the term jjireipoy, which signified, in the case of Epirus, a mainland contiguous to certain islands, confirms that sense. (3) That some technical term is required to de signate masses of land, the individuality of which is generally recognised."], [38, "Intuod. PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. 22 Coarf (from the Latincosta, \"rib'' or \"side j, a stnp of land border ine on the sea: in our Authorised Version of the Bible the term is used in an extended sense for any boundary or bounded district Shore, a strip of soil immediately contiguous to any body ot standing water, whether the sea or a lake._ Harbour or haven, an indentation m the coast, oflering protection to shipping ; both words are of Saxon origin. Cove a harbour formed by a very narrow entrance leading to an expanding sheet of water. Creek, a very small harbour, such as would be found at the mouth of a rivulet, or in a narrow winding inlet ; in the United States the term has been extended to signify a rivulet ; and in Austraha, to the bed of a watercourse, whether containing running water, water collected in holes, or no water at all ; these latter senses properly belong to the third division of our subject. (2.) The terms relating to the elevation of land are : \u2014 Mountain ( from the Latin mons), an elevation of the earth's surface to the extent of 2000 ft. or more above the adjacent district. Hill (from a Saxon term), an elevation of a similar character, but not exceeding 2000 ft. above the adjacent district. Range, in connexion with the above terms, a prolongation of elevated ground in any direction ; chain, a series of elevations, more or less detached from each other, but preserving a uniform direction; and system, a number of ranges regarded in reference to each other, and as parts of a whole. Slope and counterslope, respectively the more gradual and the steeper inclinations of a mountain-range on its opposite sides. Axis of a mountain range, an imaginary line running in the direction of the range itself. Valley (from the Latin vallis), an elongated depression between two elevations, having an outlet at its lower extremity. Basin or Hollow, a circular depression surrounded on all sides by elevations. Watershed ' (from the German wasserseheide), the water-parting or line of demarcation between two depressions, as marked by the flow of the water in different directions. Plateau, Tableland, or Highland (the first a French term, the second its English equivalent) an elevated region of considerable breadth standing at a generally uniform level. The surface of such a region may be either plain or rugged ; in the latter case the term \" highland\" is more appropriate, inasmuch as \" tableland \" conveys the idea of a strictly level, as well as an elevated surface. Plain, a region with a level or nearly level surface. The term is, properly speaking, a generic one, applicable to high as well as low ground ; but as a high plain has a specific designation (tableland), and as the* most numerous and extensive plains on the earth are low, \"plain\" is commonly applied in a specific sense to a low as dis tinguished from a high level tract. Plains are designated by various local names, such as Llanos (the Spanish form of the Latin planus), applied to the plains about the Orinoco in South America; Steppa (from a Russian word signifying \"barren\";, the vast treeless plains 1 The latter part of the term \"water shed\" unfortunately suggests the notion of shedding or pouring water, in which case it would apply more correctly to the side or inclination of the valley; this, how ever, is not its meaning: the adjunct shtd is an adaptation of Uie German scheidt, \" division \" or \" parting.\""], [39, "23 Chap.

(3.) The terms relating to the drainage of land are : \u2014 Biver, a con siderable stream of water flowing over land, and having tributary or lesser streams flowing into it and termed its affluents: these lesser streams may in turn have their affluents, which would be tributaries to, though not affluents of, the main stream. (The right and left banka of a river are those which are to the right and left hand of a spectator supposed to be looking down the stream.) River-basin, the whole region drained by a river and its tributaries. Embouchure, or mouth of a river (the former a French term equivalent to the latter), the point at which it joins a larger body of water. Delta fso called from its resemblance to the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet), the triangular space occasionally enclosed between the diverging mouths of a river and the sea-coast. Estuary (from the Latin \u00e6stuarimn), an inlet of the sea into which a river discharges itself, and thus becomes subject to tidal influence ; such estuaries are termed in Scotland firths. Lake, a collection of water in a depression or basin. Lagoon, a collection of water in low sandy soil adjacent to the sea, formed either by the overflow of or infiltration from the sea or a large river. Loch in Scotland, and Lough in Ireland, applied indifferently to an inland lake or to an estuary of a river. \u00a7 8. Geological Structure. \u2014 Land, by which we here mean the surface of the solid substance of the earth, is composed of various elements, and receives its external form and character partly from the nature of the elements themselves, and partly from the agencies which have been exerted on these elements. The full consideration of this subject be longs to geology, and a very brief sketch of the results of that science will suffice for our present purpose. An examination of the interior of the earth proves that by far the largest portion of its contents are arranged in strata, or layers, occasionally lying horizontally one above the other, but more generally tilted up by internal forces at angles of greater or less inclination, and thus becoming exposed at various points of the earth's surface. These strata are found to rest on rocks of an entirely different character, consisting of irregular masses lying in all directions, and hence termed unstratified. These are also occa sionally thrust up to the earth's surface through the superincumbent stratified rocks. The agencies that have decided the character of the various rocks are mainly fire and water. The unstratified rocks owe their origin to fire, and are hence termed igneous. To this class belong trap-rocks (such as are seen at Fingal's Cave and the Giant's Causeway), the various species of volcanic rocks, and, perhaps, granite. The strati fied rocks owe their origiu to the action of water, or, in the case of the metamorphic rocks (such, as gneiss), which form a connecting link be tween the two, to the combined action of fire and water. The stratified rocks are of various kinds, and are arranged by geologists in groups, according to their respective age The following enumeration of the"], [40, "PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. Introd, 24 stratified systems, in the order of their antiquity, and with their cha, racteristic productions, will be sufficient for our purpose :-(l) Met* morX-gneiss, mica-schist, and clay-slate (2) Silurian-slate, sand- S, Xpure limestone. (3) Old Red Sandstone ovDevonian red sandstone, limestone, and conglomerates. (4) Carboniferous-co3.\\, mountain limestone, millstone grit. (5) Pe^an-magnesian lime stone (6) Triassic\u2014 marl, sandstone, and limestone. (7) Oolitic limestone (Portland stone), blue clay, and bituminous shale. (8) Cre taceous\u2014chalk and flints. (9) Tertiary\u2014 London clay, gravel, sand,, and marl. (10) Post-Tertiary\u2014 surface soil and alluvial deposits of modern date. As the surface soil and the mineral products of each locality depend upon the stratum which happens to crop out there, and as even the external features of a country\u2014 its mountain-ranges, peaks, hills, and valleys\u2014 are the exponents of its internal formation, it is evident that geological considerations must hold a place in an intelligent study of geography. \u00a7 9. Volcanic Agency. \u2014 The state of the earth s interior falls within the province of geographical research only so far as it acts upon the exterior surface. This it does in various ways, but chiefly by means of volcanic agency. Numerous indications lead to the conclusion that the crust on which we live encloses a vast mass of matter in a Btate of fusion from excessive heat. The violent action of volcanoes, their extreme heat, the temperature of thermal springs, and the gradual increase of heat in deep mines, may be cited in support of this hypothesis. The last mentioned proof has been made the basis of calculations as to the tem perature of the earth's interior ; but the observations are too variable, and the modifying influences too numerous, to warrant any very exact conclusion on this subject. The general estimate is an increase of 1\u00b0 of temperature for 50 ft. of descent. Thermal springs attain, in several instances a heat of 200\u00b0 ; but the depth of the reservoir whence they come, and the local conditions possibly affecting the temperature, are matters of speculation. Volcanic agency has exercised vast influence in deciding the form of the earth's crust, and probably still continues to operate on it by elevating certain localities and depressing others. A gradual, though unequal, process of elevation is going on in the Scandi navian peninsula, as is attested by modern observations on the \" level\" of the Baltic Sea. That the west coast of Great Britain has been simi larly elevated, is testified by the existence of old, or \"raised\" beaches: and the same may be observed of a considerable portion of South America, particularly the western coast, where various species of shells are found on the dry land. On the other hand, a gradual depression has been observed along the coast of Greenland, and, from the organi zation of the coral insect, which cannot exist at a greater depth than about 175 feet below the level of the sea, it has been inferred that the numerous existing instances of coral reefs of excessive depth are due to the gradual subsidence of the foundation, which has permitted the con struction of the reef by successive stages. That these changes are the result of volcanic agency is a conclusion which does not admit of de monstration, but which is rendered probable by the visible effects of that agency on the surface of the earth. \u00a7 10. Volcanoes. \u2014 The most prominent effects of volcanic agency are displayed in the eruptions of volcanic mountains, and the shocks of earthquakes. The connexion between these phenomena is undoubted; but the precise manner in which volcanic agency is exerted so as to produce an earthquake, is unknown. Volcanoes in an active state are"], [41, "Chap. II. VOLCANOES\u2014 EARTHQUAKES. 25 very unequally distributed over the earth's surface. They are more numerous (1) in the Torrid than in any other zone ; (2) on the line of the sea-coast than in the interior ; and (3) on the coast of the Pacific than on that of the Atlantic. Volcanoes are indeed found in all lati tudes ; in the extreme north, in Jan Meyen off the coast of Greenland, and in Iceland ; and in the extreme south, in Victoria Land. They are also found occasionally inland, as in the cases of Demavend, south of the Caspian, and Pishan and Ho-tcheou in the Thian-shan range in Central Asia, They are also not unknown in the Atlantic, there being about thirty-eight in that ocean itself and its subordinate divisions. But the majority of the active volcanoes, to the extent of 190 out of a total number of 270, are situated in and around the Pacific, which is completely girdled with a volcanic band ; and of these the groups lie thickest in the Torrid Zone, there being no less than forty-three vol canoes (active and extinct) in Java alone, twenty-one in Luzon and the Philippines, thirty-eight in Guatemala, and seventeen in Quito. The immediate effects of volcanic eruptions on the earth's surface are well known. In some instances the cone itself, whence the eruption is to issue, is forced into existence, as instanced in the following cases : \u2014 Jorullo, on the plain of Mexico, which was thrown up, in 1759, to a height of 1365 feet above the surrounding plain, which itself stands 2890 feet above the sea; Sabrina, near the Azores, which was thrown up, in 1810, to a height of 400 feet above the sea, and has since dis appeared ; Monte Nuevo, already noticed in the ' Manual of Ancient Geography,' p. 564, as occupying a considerable portion of the old Lucrine lake; and Monte Rossi, on the side of \u00c6tna, thrown up in 1669 to the height of 450 feet. In other instances, existing cones have been very much enlarged by continual deposits of ashes and lava, as has happened in the case of Vesuvius. Not only this, but occasionally the ashes have fallen in vast heaps on the surrounding districts to such a depth as even to bury whole towns, as in the well-known cases of Her culaneum and Pompeii. The molten lava has been another cause of wide-spread devastation, issuing either from the crater's mouth, or from crevices in the mountain, in almost inconceivable quantities, and over pouring the subjacent plains and valleys in a deep, broad, irresistible stream. In Iceland a single eruption, in 1783, produced two such streams, one of them fifty miles long and from twelve to fifteen miles broad, the other forty miles long and seven miles broad, the contents being estimated at 20,000,000,000 cubic yards. Other effects are pro duced by this same volcanic energy. We may notice ( 1 ) the Salses, or mud-volcanoes, small mounds whence issue mud, hot water, and gases of various kinds, instances of which occur near Girgenti in Sicily, and near Bakou, on the west coast of the Caspian, in the province of Shirwan ; and (2) the Geysers, situated about thirty-five miles from Mount Hecla \u2014 thermal springs from which the water is ejected at varying intervals in jets attaining sometimes a height of 150 feet. \u00a711. Earthquakes. \u2014 Earthquakes, being the result of volcanic agency, are consequently most numerous and violent in the volcanic regions. But they are not confined to those regions ; they are of by no means rare occurrence even in our own country, though the shocks are gene rally bo slight as to be hardly perceptible. A tolerably smart shock was felt in the western counties in 1863. The movements produced by earthquakes assume different directions : sometimes the movement is upwards or vertical, sometimes up and down, like the undulation of a wave, and sometimes rotatory or vorticose, hke the action of a whirl- MOD. GEO. c"], [42, "PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. Introd. 26 tha? centre The rotatory movement holds the first place, and the vertcal movement the second place, in the scale of destruct.veness ; both Ire happily, of comparatively rare occurrence Sudden elevations and depressions of the ground are among the most striking effects of earth ouakes In the great earthquake of 1755 the quay at Lisbon suddenly sank with a vast crowd who had fled thither for safety, and its Bite was occupied by a chasm about 600 feet deep. The earthquake referred to was of tbe circular description, and was felt over an area extending from the Baltic to the West Indies. The effects of earthquakes on buildings are most disastrous. The havoc produced at Manilla in 1863 and at Mendoza March 20th, 1861, where 12,000 perished, will be fresh in the memory of most of our readers. Among the more famous historical earthquakes, we may refer to those that happened at Lisbon, November lst, 1755; at Caraccas, March 26th, 1812; at Port Royal, in Jamaica, 1692; and in Calabria, Feb. 5th, 1783. _ \u00a7 12. Continents. \u2014 Land is distributed over the earths Burface in masses' of varying size, the intervals being filled up by the sea. Two of these masses are of excessive size as compared with the rest, the Old World, or, as it is sometimes termed, the Eastern Continent, con- taining about 32,000,000 square miles, and the New World, or Western Continent, about 15,000,000 square miles. For the rest, Australia con- tains about 3,000,000 square miles, leaving, according to the total estimate of 51 500,000 square miles for the entire land surface, about 1,500,000 square miles for the islands of the Pacific Ocean. As regards then- form and structure, the two great masses present several striking points both of resemblance and of contrast. Each approximates to a pyramidal or triangular form, with the apex pointing southwards, and the base skirting the Arctic Ocean. Each exhibits a similar tendency in its details ; the peninsulas of Arabia, Hindostan, Malacca, and Kamt- schatka, in Asia ; of Italy and Greece, in Europe ; of California, Florida, and we may add, of Greenland, in America, all terminating in southerly promontories, just as the whole masses terminate in the promontories of Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope. Each presents a single ex- ception to this general rule, the peninsula of Denmark m the Eastern Continent finding its counterpart in that of Yucatan in the Western. Each is furnished with a backbone of mountain-ranges, traversing its whole length, and dividing it into unequal portions. Each, moreover, is depressed towards the Arotic Ocean, and elevated towards its southern extremity. So far for the points of resemblance. In respect to the points of contrast, we may notice that the Eastern Continent has its greatest extension in the direction of east and west, the Western in the di- rection of north and south. The Eastern protrudes westward in Northern Africa ; the Western recedes in the same latitudes, so that the one would, as it were, fit into the other, conveying the impression that the Atlantic is a mighty valley, severing from each other corresponding heights. Ita Eastern abounds in irregularities and indentations of its coast-line ; tta Western is comparatively regular and uniform. Still more marked are the contrasts presented by the several divisions of the two worlds. Europe stands pre-eminent in regard to the sinuosity of its coast-line, and the proportion it bears to the area of the continent. America stands next in these refspects, the proportion being affected, however,"], [43, "Chap. II. ISLANDS\u2014 MOUNTAIN-SYSTEMS. 27 more by the elongation of its southern division than by sinuosity. Asia comes next, and Africa last, both being much affected by the massiveness of their forms, and the latter still further by the regularity of its coast. We refrain from giving any exact calculation of the pro portions of coast-line and area; but we may say very roughly, that, taking the comparative areas into consideration, Europe has four times as much coast as Africa, three times as much as Asia, and twice as much as America. With regard to elevation, South America holds the first place with an average elevation above the level of the sea of 2302 feet ; Asia comes next with an elevation of 2264 feet ; then North America, 1496 feet; and lastly Europe, 1342 feet. \u00a7 13. Islands. \u2014 Islands may be classed under two heads, as con tinental, and oceanic or pelagic, according as they lie adjacent to a mainland or in mid ocean. Each class exhibits a distinctive form, con tinental islands being generally elongated, oceanic either round or oval ; aud each class exhibits a distinctive arrangement, continental isle3 appearing in more or less straight lines, oceanic in circular groups. Each also may be referred to a different origin, continental islands generally showing by their geological character either that they have been severed from the adjacent mainland by the submersion of the intervening space, or that they have been simultaneously upheaved with it ; while oceanic islands owe their origin partly to volcanic action \u2014 the tendency to circular grouping being attributable to this cause, even where volcanic action is not exhibited \u2014 and partly to coral formation. As examples of continental isles, we may instance the Kurile and Japanese islands, which seem to be a prolongation of the peninsula of Kamtschatka; or, again, Sumatra, Java, and Timor, belonging to the Malay peninsula : and, as examples of oceanic groups, the Marquesas, Galapagos, and Fiji groups, in the Pacific. Coral islands are found chiefly in the torrid zone. They are the accumulated Becretions of a small insect, originally deposited on submarine rocks, sunk not more than 175 feet below the level of the sea, and gradually built up until they reach the upper air. The islands thus formed are in the form of hollow circles, containing lagoons in the middle. The Caroline Islands, north of New Guinea, may be cited as an instance. \u00a7 14 Configuration of Mountain-Systems. \u2014 Mountain-ranges exhibit great diversity in respect to their general character, their direction, and their elevation. These diversities may be attributed partly to the degree of force exerted in their upheaval, and partly to the geological period in which that force was exerted. It is beyond our province to trace out fully the connexion between the cause and the effect ; we shall confine ourselves to a statement of the leading facts connected with these topics, commencing with the general character or arrangement of mountain-ranges. (1) The first class of mountains which we shall notice is that in which parallelism is the prevailing feature. The Rocky Mountains in North America furnish an example of this : they consist of a series of ranges in three or four parallel lines, and terminating at different points, so that one range overlaps the other at its extremity. The central Andes exhibit parallelism of a simpler nature, consisting of two lofty ranges with plateaus intervening. (2) The second class consists of a single dorsal chain with lateral spurs diverging from it at various angles : its chief characteristic is the divarication of these lateral ranges. The southern Andes, the Pyrenees, and Caucasus belong to this class : in each there is a single defined crest with numerous spurs striking off in directions more or less transverse to that of the axis c 2"], [44, "Introd. PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. 28 of the main range and enclosing valleys which sink rapidly down to the plains (3) The third class is that in which ramification is the leading feature. In this there is found a range of predominating importance, from which subordinate ranges branch off m various directions ex tending over a large area, and enclosing plains or valleys. The Alpine system in Europe is an example of this: it serves as a basis whence the numerous ranges of Central and Southern Europe seem to spring (4) The last class we shall notice consists of those mountains which form the edges of plateaus, and which lose much, if not all of the appearance of mountains, when they are regarded from the plateau itself. The Himalayan Mountains thus form the rim of the lofty plateau of Tibet, which attains in some parts an elevation of 1 7 000 ft , and leaves only the surplus elevation of the mountains visible. The Altai ranges are in many parts only a series of terraces by which the central plateau descends to the Siberian plains : their summits as sume the tabulated form peculiar to such an origin. The Ghauts of Hindostan are another instance of ranges supporting plateaus. \u00a7 15. Direction of Mountain-Systems. \u2014 The directions of mountain- systems appear at first sight to be so diversified as to admit of no classi- fication. Yet geological research may eventually establish certain general laws on this subject. It has been surmised, for instance, that ranges belonging to the same geological period assume a parallel di- rection in all parts of the world; and, again, that every system lies in a great circle of the globe, proving that the upheaving force has radiated from the centre of the globe. Whether further examination will establish these suppositions, it remains to be seen. The direction of the primary mountain-systems may be detected from the direction ofthe continents on which they lie, the form of the latter being decided by the main line of upheaval. Thus in the Eastern Continent an almost continuous line of elevation runs from west to east, and in the Western Continent a similar line from north to south. In the former the elevation is both broader and more irregular than in the latter. In Europe the chief links are the Pyrenees, the Alps, and the Balkan ; in Africa, Atlas, which connects with the Pyrenean system ; in A sia, the belt of plateaus with the connecting and sustaining mountain-ranges, viz., Taurus in Anatolia. Ararat in Armenia, Elburz and Hindoo-Coosh in Iran, and then the vast expanse of the great plateau of Central Asia, bounded S. by Himalaya, and N. by the Altai ranges, and traversed by Kuen- lun and Thian-shan. In the Western Continent there are only three great links, viz. \u2014 the Rocky Mountains in the N.,the Andes in the S., and the plateaus of Central America which connect these two. The northern portion exhibits the same tendency to expansion that we have noticed in Asia, but not to the same extent. The chain of the Rocky Mountains bifurcates and encloses between its two branches a consider- able breadth of plateau, containing the basins of Utah, Oregon, and other districts. What is thus observed with regard to the two great masses of lands, holds good with regard to the lesser ones also. An island of elongated form, such as Madagascar, will generally he found to contain a spinal range of mountains in the direction of its axis. In other cases the form of a land-area is due to the til ting-up of a circular rim of mountains, enclosing central plains, as is the case in Australia and South Africa. \u00a7 16. Comparative Heights of Mountain-Ranges. \u2014 In regard to ele- vation two points have to be considered, viz., the mean height of a range as a whole, and the extreme heights of its summits. As a general rule,"], [45, "Chap. II. MOUNTAINS\u2014 PLATEAUS. 29 these bear a proportion to each other, so that the highest peaks are found in the ranges of the greatest mean height. The mean height of Himalaya is estimated at 15,670 feet, ofthe Andes at 11,530 feet, and of the Alps at 7353 feet, and the culminating points are in each instance somewhere about double of these amounts. The subjoined diagram exhibits the comparative heights of the summits in each division of the world. The two highest peaks in the world belong to the Himalayas in Asia, the third place being possibly contested by Kuen lun, to which a height of 27,918 ft. has been assigned. Omitting this as standing in need of confirmation, the three extreme points are \u2014 Mount Everest, in Nepaul, 29,002 feet above the level ofthe sea; Dip sang, in the Karako rum range, 28,278 feet ; Kunchinginga 28,178 feet, and Sichsar 27,799 feet, both in Sikkim ; and Dhaulaghiri, in Ne paul, 26,826 feet. The highest points in South America are \u2014 Aconcagua in Chili, 23,910 feet; Sahama, in Peru, 22,350 feet; Parinacota, also in Peru, 22,030 feet; and Gualateiri, on the borders of Peru and Bolivia, 21,960 feet. The highest points in Africa \u2014 Kenia 20,065 feet, 19. Diagram of the Comparative Heights of Mountains. and Kilimandjaro 20,000 feet, both lying near the east coast to the south of the equator. The highest points in Europe \u2014 Elburz, in Caucasus, 18,493 feet, and Mont Blanc, in the Alps, 15,744 feet. The highest points in North America \u2014 Mount St. Elias, in the North Pacific range, 17,850; Popocatepetl, in Mexico, 17,717, and Orizaba, in the same couDtry, 17,374 feet. And lastly, for the sake of comparison, the highest points in the British Isles \u2014 Bennevis, in Scotland, 4368 feet ; Snowdon, in Wales, 3590 feet, and Scawfell, in England, 3229 feet. \u00a7 17. Plateaus. \u2014 A plateau is the result of an upheaval of the earth's crust on a large scale and with such force as to elevate it very consider ably above the general level of the land. It is in all cases edged with mountains, which usually rise above the level ofthe plateau, but some times are the mere termination of the plateau itself. Two classes of plateaus may be distinguished, viz., those which are wholly encircled"], [46, "PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. Introd. 30 by mountain-ranges and have their own reservoirs of water ; and those which are open on one or more than one side to the sea. The plateau of Central Asia, enclosed by the ranges of Thian-shan, Bolor, Kuen-lun, and In-shan, is an instance of the former kind ; and we may place in the same class the plateaus of Utah in North America and of Titicaca in South America. The plateau of Tibet, to the S. of Kuen-lun, is an instance of the second kind. Plateaus have a beneficial effect in mode rating the heat of tropical and sub-tropieal climates ; in Mexico, for instance, the widest differences of heat and salubrity exist between the maritime district and the interior table-land ; the city of Quito, situated very nearly under the equator, enjoys a moderate temperature; and, again, in the Deccan, in southern Hindostan, there are whole districts with an English climate under an Indian sun. On the other hand, plateaus interpose very solid barriers between the regions on each side of them, and are unfavourable to intercommunication. The distribution of plateaus on the earth's surface is very unequal. Europe has only one of any size, occupying about half of Spain. Asia is traversed by a broad central band of plateau, widening as it advances eastward until it ter minates on the frontier of China : the chief divisions of this band, with their respective heights are \u2014 the plateaus of Anatolia (3000 feet), Iran (2500 to 3500 feet), Tibet (11,500 feet), and Gobi (3000 to 4220 feet). Africa exhibits an instance of a high rugged plateau in Abyssinia (8000 feet), and of a comparatively low and flat one in the Great Desert, with elevations ranging from 1000 to 5000 feet. In the southern part of that continent the high land of the interior descends to the coast by a series of terraces. America possesses some remarkable plateaus con nected with its great dorsal chains : foremost among these is the Great Basin of Utah (4000 feet), between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada, and wholly shut off from the sea. The southerly limbs of the Rocky Mountains terminate in the plateau of Chihuahua (about 5000 feet) ; and this is connected southwards with the great plateau of Ana huac or Mexico (6000 to 9000 feet), the sides of which present all the appearance of a massive wall of mountain when viewed from the sea. In South America plateaus are found in the high Andes, sometimes between the parallel ranges, and sometimes on the main ridge: we may instance the plateaus of Bogota in New Granada (9000 feet), Popayan in 2\u00b0 30' N. lat. (6000 feet), Quito (10,000 feet), and Lake Titicaca (13,000 feet). \u00a7 18. Plains. \u2014 Plains, in the specific sense of the term as meaning lowland plains, occupy a large portion of the world's surface, and are in many cases characterized by conditions of position, soil, and climate, which are highly favourable to civilization and prosperity. The circum stance of their being low and open facilitates both external and internal communication, gives them a comparatively warm climate, and pro motes the formation of surface soil from alluvial or vegetable deposits. Three classes of plains may be distinguished : \u2014 (1) The vast plains which result from a uniform upheaval of the earth's crust over a large area, and with such moderate force as elevates them but slightly above the level of the sea. (2) The enclosed plains which are found in river basins, and which are in point of fact broad valleys, generally with rich deposits of alluvial soil. (3) The partially enclosed plains which so frequently intervene between the sea and a chain of mountains running parallel to the coast. The three classes may perhaps be characterized as (1) continental plains ; (2) river plains ; (3) maritime plains. The most remarkable instance of the first kind is the great plain which"], [47, "Chap. II. PLAINS\u2014 RIVERS. 31 occupies, with slight interruption, the whole northern portion of the Eastern Continent between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. Por tions of this are depressed even below the level of the sea, as in the case of the Caspian basin and some parts of Holland ; and other portions exhibit a remarkable degree of levelness, the Siberian plain at Irkutsk having (for instance) an elevation of only 1360 ft. above the sea-level. South America furnishes another instance of an extensive plain very nearly on a dead level along the courses of the Orinoco and the Amazons. Of the second class of plains we may instance in the Eastern Continent the rich plain of Lombardy in the basin of the Po ; the plains of Hungary, and Wallachia along the course of the Danube; the fertile plain of Egypt, which Herodotus describes as \"the gift of the Nile ;\" the Great Plain of China, covering an area of 210,000 sq. m., about the lower courses of the Yang-tze and the Hoang-ho ; the plain of Mesopotamia in the Euphrates-Tigris basin, the seat of two of the mightiest empires of antiquity ; and the plain of Northern India along the courses of the Indus and Ganges. The Western Continent furnishes a remarkable instance of such a plain in the basin of the Mississippi. Plains of the third olass occur wherever the sea-coast is fringed with mountains : in the Western Continent, for instance, they are to be found on the western coast along the base of the Audes in S. America, and of the coast-ranges in N. America : in the latter division a maritime plain of great importance intervenes between the Appala chian Mountains and the Atlantic. The difference in the aspect and vegetation of plains has already been adverted to in the explanation of the local designations applied to them. Vast regions in Africa and Asia are barren from the absence of natural or artificial irrigation ; and the plains of Northern Siberia and of Arctic America are consigned to hopeless sterility from the severity of the climate. \u00a7 19. Rivers. \u2014 The moisture that falls on the earth sinks for the most part beneath its surface and collects in natural reservoirs at various depths. Thence it re-issues in springs : these form rivulets, in accordance with the law of gravitation whereby water seeks the lowest level ; and rivulets, combining in a single stream, form rivers. Such is the origin of the majority of rivers : occasionally, however, they have their sources in glaciers, and are produced by melted snow or ice, while in other cases they are traced up to lakes or reservoirs on the earth's surface ; but as the lake itself is due either to springs in its bed or to the reception of streams from higher ground, this can hardly be regarded as an exception to the general rule above stated. A river with numerous affluents bears more or less resemblance to a tree with its trunk and branches ; the river being, however, less symmetrical than the tree. The points of chief interest in connexion with a river are its sources, its destination, the character of its course, the extent of its basin, its length, volume, and velocity, and the nature of its outlet. The sources of a river are in one sense the sources of all its branches, in another and more usual sense the source of its chief branch. A ques tion may arise as to which out of several branches is to be deemed the chief branch, whether the longest or the largest, meaning by the largest the one with the greatest volume. The mere assignment of the name of the trunk-stream to one of the branches passes for a little : it appears in many instances to have beeu decided by the direction rather than the size of the branch. Thus the Missouri is the true representative of the Mississippi in length ; and the Inn has a greater volume than the Danube at the point of their confluence : but in each"], [48, "Introd. 32 PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. case the name adheres to the branch which retains the direction ofthe main stream. Another noticeable point is that a lake cannot be deemed the source of a river unless it is entirely fed by springs or rainfall \u2022 if it receives feeders from higher ground, the chief feeder, whether the longest or largest, must be regarded as the representative of the outgoing river, just as the Bann in Ireland is (as it were) traced through Lough Neagh, and the Angara in Siberia through Lake Baikal. It is therefore questionable whether Lake Victoria Nyanza can be pro nounced to be the source of the Nile. \u00a7 20. Oceanic and Continental River-Systems. \u2014 As to their destination, rivers terminate either in the sea or in lakes which have no outlet. Hence the distinction between Oceanic river-systems, and Continental river-systems. (1) Continental river-systems rarely attain to large dimensions ; yet the largest European river, the Volga, has such a termination in the Caspian, and the Sea of Aral receives the drainage of a large area through the Sirr and the Amoo. The Jordan furnishes another instance on a small scale, discharging itself into the Dead Sea. The receptacles in two of these cases \u2014 the Caspian and the Dead sea are depressed below the level of the sea, but a depression below the level of the surrounding country is all that is needed to the formation of a continental river-system : Lake Balkash in Siberia is an instance of this, and a still more remarkable instance occurs in the Desaguadero, with its receptacle Lake Poopo-Choro, situated amid the high Andes. (2) With regard to Oceanic river-systems, they may be classified according to the ocean to whose basin they belong, an I this classifica tion is important both as showing the arrangement of the earth's surface as a whole, and as exhibiting the commercial value of the oceans as highways of communication. The Atlantic holds the first place among Oceanic river-systems. Its basin extends to the Andes and the Rocky Mountains in America, to Caucasus and the Valdai Hills in Europe, and probably to the slopes of Kenia and Kilimandjaro in Africa. It receives the mighty rivers of the New World \u2014 the Amazons, the Mississippi, the La Plata, the St. Lawrence, the Tocantius, the Orinoco, with many other first-class rivers. In the Old World its tributaries are the Nile, the Niger, the Danube, together with nearly the whole of the European rivers (the Volga being the chief exception), the Senegal, the Gambia, and the Orange River. The Pacific river system attains its greatest extent in Eastern Asia : on the American side it is contracted to narrow limits by the disposition of the great mountain-rauges ; the Yang tze-kiang, the Amoor, and the Hoang-ho, are its principal tributaries. The Menam, of Siam, may also be noticed, though of far less importance than the others. The Indian Ocean river-system is restricted to Southern Asia, including under this term the northern skirts of the Himalayan region, whence it receives two of its largest streams, viz., the Indus and the Brahmapootra, and perchance also the Irrawady, whose upper course is not well known. The Ganges, which interlaces its network of channels with those of the Brahmapootra, is the most valuable river belonging to this system. The Euphrates, with its twin-stream the Tigris, is to be noticed. The Arctic river-system is extensive, but rendered comparatively valueless from the ice-bound waters of the ocean-basin. It comprises the whole of Siberia, with the exception of the Amoor region, and from this vast area it draws its largest tributaries, the Obi, the Yenesei, and the Lena. From Europe it receives the Dwina, with some others of less note and from America the Mackenzie, which carries off the surplus waters of"], [49, "Chap. II. RIVER-BASINS\u2014 LENGTH, ETC, OF RIVERS. 33 the large lakes of Arctic America. The Saskatchewan, with its lower channel the Nelson, is generally classed as a river of the Arctic system ; but if Hudson Bay belong to the Atlantic, it should be assigned to this latter. \u00a7 21. Riner-Basins. \u2014 As regards the basin of a river, two points deserve attention, viz. : \u2014 the extent of it, and the character of its boundaries. The extent of a basin is estimated by an inspection of all its tributary streams, and the basin will be large in proportion to the length and the number of those streams. The Nile, which has the longest basin of any river in the world (for its sources are in direct distance farther from the sea than those of any other), yet has a com paratively small basin, from the singular circumstance that for the last 1740 m. of its course it receives no affluent whatever, and its basin is for this distance confined to the valley in which it flows. The largest river-basins are found in plains. The Amazons stands by far the first in respect to the size of its basin, covering an area of about two millions of miles, and exceeding by one half the size of the basin of the Missis sippi, which comes next to it in this respect. The Obi in Siberia holds the third place, and then follow the La Plata and the Yenisei. The boundaries of a river-basin are marked sometimes by a great elevation, sometimes by one so slight that it is difficult to draw a line of demarcation between two adjacent basins. Indeed, in one well known instance, two large rivers are connected by a natural channel, viz., the Orinoco and the Amazons by the Cassiquiare. The ground about the sources of the Mississippi is so level that in very wet seasons a water communication is effected between it and the Red River which flows northward. The character of the ground in which the watershed lies is of importance as respects the formation of canals : if no great barrier intervenes, rivers can readily be joined by artificial channels, and seas on opposite sides of a country or a continent can be connected. The Black, Baltic, and White Seas are thus uuited in Russia ; and the Mediterranean, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay in France. On the other hand, in Spain, where the river-basins are divided by ranges and plateaus, a system of canalization is difficult, if not impossible. \u00a7 22. Length, volume, and velocity of Rivers. \u2014 (1) The length of a river depends, partly on the direct distance between its source and mouth, and partly on the amount of sinuosity it experiences between these points. Sometimes the latter is the more influential considera tion of the two. The Orinoco, for instance, has a course of about 1500 m., though the direct distance between its source and mouth does not much exceed 400 m. ; the Vistula, again, has an extent of winding nearly equal to its length in direct distance. Such sinuosities may be traced to two different causes, viz., the intervention of mountain chains, which create great and frequently sudden deflections, particu larly where changes of geological formation take place ; and the level ness of plains and broad valleys, across which a river meanders torpidly with many small windings. The Orinoco is affected by the former cause, being deflected by the Parima mountains ; the Mississippi by the latter, its slope from the confluence of the Missouri downwards being so slight that the river frequently gains only a mile of direct distance in 30 miles of course. In the long run, however, the distance of the watershed from the sea is the most important consideration, and hence we find the largest rivers in regions where the watershed is farthest removed from the sea, as for instance in South America, where the Andes form the watershed; in North America where the Rocky Moun- c 3"], [50, "PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. Introd. 34 tains throw the rivers off from its eastern slope towards the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans; and again in Asia, where such an extensive region surrounds the central plateau northwards across Siberia, and eastwards across China Few large rivers spring from a southern slope, and fewer still from a western. The Mississippi-Missouri has the longest developed course (i. e. including the windings), and the Nile probably the greatest direct distance from source to mouth: then follow in order the Amazons, the Yang-tze-kiang, the Yenesei, the Amoor, the Lena, and the Hoang-ho. ThW Volga is the longest continental river, and holds the next place. (2) The volume of a river is not always propor tioned to its length, but is affected by the number of its tributaries, the rain-fall in its basin, and the character of the country through which it flows. The Ohio, for instance, with a length of about 1000 m. has a larger volume than the Missouri, with a length of about 3000 m. chiefly in consequence of the desert region through which the latter flows in its lower course. The data for comparing the volume of different rivers are scanty : we may mention that the mean discharge of the Mississippi is estimated at 675,000 cubic ft. per second, of the Amazons, at Obydos (55\u00b0 W. long.), at 550,000 cubic ft. per second; and of the Thames at 1350 cubic ft. per second. The volume of a river is subject to increase either from heavy rains or from the melting of the snow about its sources. In our own country such fluctuations are irregular, and are most frequent in winter. In countries where the snow lies deep, the rivers attain their greatest volume in spring and early summer, as is the case with the Mississippi. Rivers fed from glaciers, as the Rhine and the Inn, are fuller in proportion to the heat of the summer. Rivers in tropical countries are affected by the pe riodical rains, and it is in such regions that the inundations are most regular both as to period and as to amount. The Amazons, lying S. of the Equator, attains its greatest height in March, and the Orinoco, N. of the Equator, in August, the difference of period being dependent on the sun's position: both these rivers inundate vast areas of the plains adjacent to them. The effect of a tropical inundation is most marked where the river passes out of the tropical region in a meridional direc tion. This is the case with the Nile, which rising in the equatorial regions flows northwards to the Mediterranean, and attains its height in Egypt long after the tropical rain-fall, aided perchance by the melt ing of the snows on Kenia, has occurred about its sources. In a river which flows parallel to the equator the flood will progress simulta neously along its whole course. We have lastly to notice the extra ordinary floods which occur in Australia, where drought and heavy rain fall appear to alternate in cycles of years. (3) The velocity of a river is decided by the following circumstances : \u2014 the general slope of its bed, the slope of its early course, including the height of its source; its volume; and the sinuosity of its course. The first of these conditions calls for small remark : a slope of 3 inches per mile creates a current of about 2\u00a3 miles per hour: a slope of 26 inches per mile renders ordinary navigation impossible ; but steamers can make head against a greater fall, as for instance between Basle and Strasburg, where the fall ia about 50 inches per mile. The average slope of the Danube is 18 inches per mile. The operation of the second and third conditions is most con spicuous in rivers whose lower courses have but a slight slope, as the Amazons, the Paraguay, and the Volga. The force which the Amazons acquires through its volume is such that its stream can be detected 240 m. out at sea. The fall of the Volga itself is only 633 ft in"], [51, "Chap. II. DELTAS\u2014 LAKES. 35 2400 miles ; but some of its tributaries, as the Kama, have a greater fall. The effect of sinuosity in a river's course is to retard the current, both by distributing the slope over a greater length and by the resistance which the bends present to the current. The effect of sinuosity is perhaps best shown by the effect of removing it: it is thus that in the Great Level about the Wash the currents of the rivers Ouse, Nen, and Welland, have been increased, and the drainage of a large area improved, by pro viding artificial direct cuts in lieu of the natural sinuous courses. \u00a7 23. Bars and Deltas. \u2014 The amount of soil and other solid matter carried down by rivers is sometimes enormous. The Ganges and Brah mapootra are said to bring down above 4,56G,000 cubic ft. per hour, the Yellow River in China 2,000,000, and the Mississippi 422,680. A portion of this matter is deposited in the bed of the river itself, and gradually raises it, and to such an extent does this proceed that many rivers, as the Mississippi, and the Waal in Holland, rise above the level of the adjacent region, and require to be restrained by artificial means, such aa levees and dykes. The remainder of the matter is carried down to the sea, and sometimes is deposited across the mouth of the river so as to form a submarine bar, ab other times accumulates to such an extent as to rise above the water and form a delta. The divergence of the mouths of a river, which give the triangular form to the delta, arises from the circumstance that the matter is deposited in the centre ofthe stream, and thus causes a bifurcation. The same process is re peated at each mouth, aud consequently the mouths are continually altering either their number or their position. In the meantime the delta keeps advancing bodily and forming fresh land in the sea. By this process large accessions have been made to the land. Lower Egypt is the formation of the Nile, and Holland of the Rhine. The rate of increase can in many instances be traced by means of ancient buildings; thus it has been found that the Delta of the Po advances 70 yards per annum, and that the Delta of the Rhone has protruded about a mile since the year 1737. The most important deltas in each continent are formed by tha following rivers; their breadth along the sea-coast, or, in other words, the length of the base of the triangle, being indicated by the accompanying figures : \u2014 In Europe, the Danube (80 miles); the Rhine (coextensive with the coast-line of Holland); the Rhone (30 miles). In Africa, the Nile (150 miles). In Asia, the Ganges (200 miles). In America, the Mississippi (130 miles). \u00a7 24. Lakes and Inland Seas. \u2014 Lakes and inland seas may be classified either according to the disposition of the surrounding ground, or ac cording to the manner in which they receive and dispose of their waters. These considerations stand to each other in the relation of cause and effect. A lake may be so situated as to lie open either to higher ground alone, or to lower ground alone, or to both, or to neither. In the first case it will receive, but not emit, surface-water ; in the second it will emit, but not receive it ; in the third, it will both receive and emit it ; and in the last case it will neither receive nor emit it. Hence four classes of lakes may be distinguished : \u2014 (1) Lakes of re ception alone. {2) Lakes of emission alone. (3) Lakes both of recep tion and emission. (4) Lakes neither of reception nor of emission. (1) Lakes of reception dispose of their surplus water either by evapor ation or by percolation; and so efficacious is the former of these two processes that some of the largest lakes of this class are diminishing in extent. This is the case with the Caspian, though it is fed by the Volga and other large rivers; and again with the Sea of Aral, which"], [52, "Introd. 36 PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. receives the Amoo and the Sirr. Another feature in these lakes is their saltness : the Great Salt Lake, in North America, is charged with 22 per cent, of salt; the Dead Sea with 26J per cent.; Urumiah, in Persia, with 25 per cent.\u2014 the ocean having on the average only 3^ per cent. The water of the Caspian is less saline than that of the ocean, and that of Lake Tchad in Africa is quite fresh. A third noticeable feature is the extreme depression at which some of these lakes lie ; the Caspian 83 ft. below the level of the sea; Lake Assal, in Abyssinia, 570 ft.; and the Dead Sea, 1312 ft. Some lakes, which are apparently devoid of egress, discharge their waters by subterranean channels: Lake Topolias, in Greece, may be adduced as an example. (2) Lakes of emission receive their water from springs in their beds and from rainfall. Such lakes are generally of small size, but derive celebrity in some instances from the rivers which emanate from them. Several lakes of this class may be observed about the head of the Mississippi basin. (3) The third class of lakes is the most numerous and important. Under it we may class the extensive system of inland seas which beset the course of the St. Lawrence in America; the lakes of Switzerland, Italy, and Russia; and our own lakes in Great Britain and Ireland. These lakes exercise a beneficial influence in various ways: in moun tainous regions they check the violence of the streams and prevent sudden inundations ; they also purify such streams of the various noxious elements with which their waters may be charged, as in the case of the Rhone, which, entering the Lake of Geneva with a turbid snow-fed stream, issues from it with pellucid purity. (4j Lakes of the fourth class are fed by springs in their beds, and dispose of their waters in the same ways as the first class. They are generally found in the craters of extinct volcanoes: the Lago di Albano in Italy, and the Laaeher See, near Andernach on the Rhine, may be cited as ex amples. Both of these have artificial outlets to prevent the inunda tions which would otherwise occur on any extraordinary augmentation of their waters. The configuration of lakes differs widely : those that occupy craters are nearly round; lakes amid mountains are generally elongated like valleys ; lakes on plains are expanded and with an irre gular outline. The Laaeher See, the Lago Maggiore, and Lake Ladoga, may be taken as types of these. Their depth also varies: mountain lakes are as a general rule deeper than lakes on plains ; the Lago Mag giore, for instance, has a depth of 2600 ft., and the lake of Constance of 964 ft.; the lakes of the St. Lawrence are situated on an elevated plain, and attain in several instances a mean depth of 1000 ft. With regard to size, the Caspian Sea is by far the largest; and Lake Superior comes next, being the largest body of fresh water in the world."], [53, "Chap. III. CLIMATE. 37 CHAPTER III.

Climate. \u2014 The influence of climate on man's abode can hardly be overestimated. Upon it depend to a veiy great extent the character of the productions of a country and its adaptation to develop the physical and intellectual capacities of its occupants. The agencies that affect climate are various and complex : heat and cold, humidity and dryness, changeableness and uniformity, the degrees of which constitute the main difference between one climate and another, are due to geo graphical position, to elevation, to the distribution of land and sea, to exposure to certain winds or ocean currents, as well as to other minor causes, such as the amount of foliage, drainage, &c. The topics to be discussed may be conveniently arranged under the heads of temperature, winds, rain, and elevation. The terms employed in this department need no explanation, with the exception of those which have been 20. Map of Mean Animal Temperature."], [54, "PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. Introd. 38 adopted to describe the lines drawn on maps illustrative of the laws of temperature, viz., isothermal, implying equality of annual temperature; isolheral, equality of summer temperature ; and isochimenal .equality of winter temperature, the words being derived from the Greek hos, \"equal\" as their common commencement, and depuri, \"heat, depos, \"summer,\" and x\u00ab^a, \"winter,\" as their respective terminations. \u00a7 2. Variations of Temperature.\u2014 The dominating agent in the re gulation of temperature is the sun, whose heat increases in pro portion as its rays approach to or attain a vertical direction. Hence summer is hotter than winter, and the regions about the equator hotter than those that are far removed from it. If, therefore, there were no modifying influences at work, the temperature would vary equably in proportion to the distance from the sun; in other words, with the degree of latitude. But this is notoriously far from being the case: there is a wide difference between the tem peratures of places situated on the same parallel of latitude: New York, for instance, and Naples, are very nearly in the same latitude, yet the mean temperature of the former is 51\u00b0 6', and of the latter 59\u00b0 6'; so that, though the rule holds good in the long run that the temperature decreases in proportion to the distance from the equator, it is clear that local conditions operate very largely to modify that rule. If, with a view to ascertain the extent of these variations, we examine a chart of the world on which the temperatures of the different regions are marked by means of what are called isothermal lines, as ex hibited in the accompanying map, we shall draw the following conclu sions: \u2014 (1) That the sea has a more equable temperature than the land. This appears from a comparison of the northern and southern hemi spheres, tbe lines of equal temperature being much less disturbed in the latter, which is the oceanic hemisphere, than in the former, which is the continental one. (2) That in the North Temperate Zone the sea is, on the whole, warmer than the land, but that in the Torrid Zone the reverse is the case, the land being warmer than the sea. (3j That con sequently an oceanic or insular climate is warmer than a continental one in high latitudes, and cooler in low latitudes. (4) That the eastern coasts are invariably colder than the western, and particularly so in the eastern as compared \"with the western hemisphere, (b) That the difference between the east coast of N. America and the west coast of N. Europe is remarkably great, the lines of mean temperature cross ing diagonally from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Iceland, and from New York to London. \u00a7 3. Causes of Variation in Temperature. \u2014 The causes that produce the variations noticed in the preceding section are mainly reducible to the three heads of \u2014 (1) the different capacities of absorbing and parting with heat possessed by the elements of land and water; (2; the in fluence of prevalent winds; and (3) the influence of ocean currents. (1) From the difference in the solidity of land and water, the rays of heat penetrate much more deeply into the latter than into the former. The consequence is that the same amount of heat will be condensed in a shallow mass of earth as is diffused over a deep body of water ; and as it is at the surface that each receives and parts with its heat, the sur face of land will more readily receive and part with heat, according to the state of the superincumbent atmosphere, than will the surface of water. In a large expanse of land, such as a continent, the temperature will thus have a tendency to run into extremes ; and, on the other hand, where a large expanse of water exists, the temperature will be more"], [55, "Chap. III. TEMPERATURE. 39 equable, the heat of summer and the cold of winter being modified by the slowness with which the water is influenced by either. Hence the distinction between a continental, and an oceanic or insular climate. In the North Temperate Zone, where the water is on the average of the year warmer than the land, the effect of the ocean is, not only to equalize, but also to raise the temperature of the districts that come under its influence; but in the Torrid Zone, where the water is cooler than the land, its effect is to lower the temperature of such dis tricts. Compare, for instance, in point of equability the continental climate of Vienna with the insular one of London ; in the former the variation between the mean temperatures of summer and winter amounts to 37\u00b0, in the latter to 26\u00b0. Compare, again, the mean annual tem perature of two places in the same latitude, the one situated in the heart of a continent, the other near the sea ; or taking an isothermal line, compare the latitudes of any two places situated on it. Edinburgh and Moscow are nearly in the same latitude ; but the former has a mean annual temperature of 47\u00b0, the latter of 40\u00b0. London and Vienna stand nearly on the same isotherm; but the former is in 51^\u00b0, the latter in 48\u00b0 N. lat. (2) The influence of winds on climate turns on the character of the surface which they cross : this branch of our subject will be dis cussed in a subsequent section. (3) The influence of ocean currents depends on the quarter whence they come, and may be inferred from what has been stated in reference to them in ch. ii. \u00a7 6. The Gulf Stream for instance, emanating from the tropical regions, and traversing the Atlantic in the direction of Northern Europe, carries with it a store of heat which perceptibly raises the temperature of the British isles, Western France, and Norway. The Arctic Current that intervenes between this stream and the coast of North America not only shuts out that continent from all participation in its genial influence, but pro duces an abnormal degree of cold. Similarly the Antarctic Current which laves the west coast of South America reduces the heat of Peru and Chili ; and the same may be said of the South Atlantic Current, which follows the west coast of Africa. \u00a7 4. Local Variations. \u2014 From these general causes affecting tempe rature we pass on to a brief statement of the local conditions which further modify it. Among these, elevation holds a primary place : for the atmosphere, being rarefied as the pressure of the column is reduced, becomes gradually colder in proportion to the height above the sea-level. The rate of decrease is usually put at 1\u00b0 of Fahrenheit per 300 ft., or more exactly 334 ft. of elevation : but the recent observations of Mr. Glaisher show that the decrease is not uniform, and that the rate of decrease diminishes in proportion to the altitude. The temperature at certain heights will, of course, vary according to the temperature at the sea-level of the places of observation : hence it happens that the line of perpetual snow descends gradually from the equator towards the poles, commencing with an elevation of about 15,000 ft., and reaching the sea-level at the Polar Circle. The nature of the soil and the character of its productions also affect the temperature in no slight degree : a dry sandy soil, for instance, will raise the temperature ; a swampy soil, forests, and grass, will depress it. The amount of vapour held in the atmosphere is another important consideration. A cloudy sky, though unfavourable to the transmission of the solar rays, is favourable to the retention of the heat already accumulated by the earth: it hence conduces to a moderate and equable temperature. A clear sky, on the contrary, is as favourable to rapid radiation of the"], [56, "Introd. 40 PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. earth's heat by night, as it is to the transmission of the sun's heat by day : it therefore leads to a wide range of temperature, with a general excess of heat. . _ \u00a7 5. Winds.\u2014 Currents of air are generated and regulated very much on the same principle as the ocean-currents of water already described. Heated air expands and becomes lighter than cold air ; consequently, whenever an inequality of temperature takes place, the equilibrium of the atmosphere is disturbed, aud the influx of the colder or heavier air in the process of restoring the equilibrium produces the phenomenon of wind. An inequality on a large scale exists between the temperatures of the tropical and the polar regions ; the excessive heat of the former rarefies the air, which consequently ascends and admits a constant rush of the colder and heavier air from the latter; and thus, if there were no modifying influences, there would be a constant interchange of currents in a direct line between the Poles and the Equator ; a cold current 21. Map of the Winda. below in the direction of the equator, a warm current above, returning to the poles. These currents do, in point of fact, exist, but they are diverted from a direct northerly and southerly course by the earth's rotation : for, commencing their course where the rotatory movement is comparatively slow, and passing on to regions where the speed is constantly increasing, the current, as it advances towards the equator, fails to keep pace with the movement, \u2014 lags behind, as it were, \u2014 and thus acquires a westerly tendency, in the opposite direction to the earth's rotation, becoming north of the equator a north-east wind, and south of the equator a south-east wind. A further obstacle to the regularity of the operation arises from the conflict between the upper and lower currents, which in temperate latitudes attain nearly to an equilibrium, aud so descend alternately to the earth's surface. It is only within the tropics that the polar current maintains with marked regularity its"], [57, "Chap. III. WINDS. 41 place as the lower stratum, producing those winds which, from the assistance rendered by them to commerce, have been well termed Trade-winds. Such winds are termed constant, as distinguished from periodical, which shift their direction at certain fixed periods, and from variable winds which occur at irregular intervals. The velocity of wind in what we should describe as a \" stiff breeze \" is about 25 m. an hour, and its pressure 3'075 lbs. on a square foot ; in a storm its velocity attains to 50 m. ; and in a violent hurnoane to 100 m. an hour \u2014 the pressure in the former case being 12-3 lbs., and in the latter 49-2 lbs. on a square foot. \u00a7 6. Constant Winds. \u2014 The North-east Trade-wiud in the Atlantic pre vails between 5\u00b0 45' and 30\u00b0 45' N. lat., but within these limits there are variations dependent on the sun's position, the extreme northern point being reached only in summer, and the extreme southern in winter : the range of each limit is about 6\u00b0, the northern receding in winter to 24\u00b0 45', and the southern advancing in summer to 11\u00b0 20'. The limits of the South-east Trade-wind are not so well defined : northwards it crosses the equator, the limit varying with the season from 1\u00b0 30' N. lat. to 3\u00b0 15' N. lat. ; southwards its general limit may be placed at the Tropic of Capricorn. Between the Trade-wind regions intervenes a zone of calms, apparently produced by the diversion of the currents upwards to the higher regions of the air. On either side of the Trade wind regions the upper or equatorial current descends to the sur face of the earth, and becomes the prevailing, though not the inva variable, wind from the Tropics to about 60\u00b0 of N. and S. lat. The direction of this is precisely the opposite of that assumed by the polar current, being a south-west wind in the Northern and a north west wind in the Southern Hemisphere. Beyond 60\u00b0 the polar current asserts its supremacy, the north-wind prevailing in the Arctic and the south-wind in the Antarctic regions ; though here, as elsewhere except within the tropics, a large amount of variableness prevails. Of the winds described in this section, the Trade-winds alone are properly entitled to be described as constant : the others are mentioned in con nexion with them, inasmuch as they are due to the same agency. \u00a7 7. Periodical Winds. \u2014 The same cause which sets in motion the great currents hitherto described, operates on a smaller scale wherever from local causes the equilibrium of the temperature is disturbed. This constantly takes place at the point where land and sea come in contact ; for inasmuch as the capacities of absorbing aud radiating heat vary considerably in these bodies, the land becomes hotter than the sea under the influence of the sun's rays, and colder when that influence is withdrawn. Hence the origin of land and sea breezes, the cold current setting in from the sea to the land when the land is hottest, and from the land to the sea when the sea is hottest. To the same cause may be ascribed many periodical winds, such as the Monsoons in the Indian Ocean, the Etesian winds in the Archipelago, and other local winds of similar character. The Monsoons \u2014 so called in consequence of their periodicity, the term being derived from a Malay or Arabic word Moussin, \"a season\" \u2014 occupy a region extending from the coast of Africa in the west to New Guinea in the east, and from the Himalayan range to the neighbourhood of the equator. Within these limits the wind blows from the north-east from October to April, and from the south-west for the rest of the year. This variation is due to the altered position of the sun in reference to the mass of land in that part of the world. During the winter months the sun being south of the line"], [58, "Introd. 42 PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. exercises its full influence on the sea, and consequently fosters the natural tendency of the wind to approach the equator from the north east During the summer months, on the other hand, the sun stands over the vast plains of southern Asia, and, heating these to an excessive degree, rarefies the air there, and establishes the south-west as the pre vailing' wind. During the change of the seasons violent storms result from the conflict of the currents. The Etesian winds are probably caused by the extreme heat of the African desert; they blow across the Mediterranean from the north in summer. \u00a7 8. Variable Winds. \u2014 Certain regions of the earth are exposed to winds of a peculiar character in respect either to violence or to tem perature. Violent winds are generically termed Hurricanes ; but this term is also specifically applied to the rotatory gales (hence termed Cyclones) which occur in the tropical regions, and especially those which emanate from the neighbourhoods of the West Indies in the Atlantic, and of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. The course assumed by these gales resembles a spiral curve, inasmuch as they both rotate on their own axis, and advance in a line which is more or less curved. The West Indian hurricanes travel in a north-easterly, and those of the Mauritius in a south-westerly direction ; the rotatory movement in the former being from right to left, and in the latter from left to right. The violent circular storms which occasionally visit the Chinese seas are termed Typhoons. Of hot, dry winds we may notice the Sirocco of the Mediterranean sea, locally termed in Spain the Solano, which de rives its character from the proximity of the Sahara ; the Harmattan, which prevails along the western coast of North Africa, and derives its character from the same source as the Sirocco ; the Samoom, which, emanating from the deserts of Arabia and Africa, sweeps over the adjacent countries in hot, sulphurous blasts, and occasionally produces Buffocation ; and the Khamsin, which visits Egypt during a period of fifty days, as the name implies, in April and May. Of cold winds we may notice the Pamperos, which sweep over the Pampas of S. America in the direction of the Atlantic ; the Mistral, which visits the lower valley of the Rhone and the coast of Provence ; and the Bora of Dalmatia. \u00a7 9. Rain. \u2014 Rain may be defined to be atmospheric moisture de scending to the surface of the earth in drops. That moisture is supplied to the atmosphere by evaporation from bodies of water on the earth, and it is retained by the atmosphere in a state of suspension so long as the temperature is undisturbed. But if from any cause the temperature of a stratum of air is reduced by coming in contact with another stratum of a lower degree of warmth, then the moisture contained in the warmer one is condensed : the globules of aqueous vapour are en larged : contiguous globules unite and form drops, and these drops descend by force of gravity to the surface of the earth. The atmosphere's ca pacity for retaining moisture is strictly proportioned to its heat, and vapour conveyed by wind to a region of great heat will be absorbed, just as under the opposite condition it will be condensed. The condi tions, then, that regulate rainfall are mainly three: \u2014 (1) The proximity of bodies of water to supply the atmosphere with moisture. (2) The temperature of the atmosphere, which regulates its capacity for holding moisture. (3) The reduction of that temperature, whereby condensa tion is produced. From the first of these conditions it follows that more rain will fall on the sea-board than in the interior of a country; from the second, that more rain will fall in a hot than in a cold region;"], [59, "Chap. III. RAIN. 43 and from the third, that rain will fall more frequently where the winds are variable than where they are constant. The two first conclusions apply, it will be observed, to the amount of rain, and the third to the frequency of rain, or, in other words, the number of rainy days. \u00a7 10. Distribution of Rain. \u2014 The distribution of rain over the earth, as known to us from observation, illustrates the principles laid down in the last section. The rainfall is greatest where the heat is greatest, namely within the Tropics, and thence diminishes gradually towards the Poles, the mean annual rainfall being computed at 8-50 ft. within the Tropics ; 3-05 ft. in the Temperate Zones; and 1*25 ft. in the Frigid Zones. The rainfall also diminishes as the distance from the sea in creases, the W. coast of France (for instance) having an amount of about 27 inches, and Central Germany of about 21 inches. The number 22. Map of Distribution of Rain. of rainy days ia greatest in the Temperate Zone, where the wind is most variable. Within the Tropics, no rain falls so long as the Trade winds retain their usual regularity; but this regularity is disturbed by the intense heat of the sun, as it attains the zenith over each part of the Torrid Zone,\u2014 the effect ofthe heat being to convert the Trade-wind into an upward current, which in the higher regions of the atmosphere comes in contact with colder strata and so has its moisture condensed. Hence in this part of the world the rains follow the course of the sun; the rainy season occurring N. of the Equator between April and Oc tober, and S. of the Equator between October and April, and attaining its height in each locality at the time when the sun sheds its vertical rays over it. An exception to this periodicity is found in the Zone of Calms, described in \u00a7 6, where the rains fall at all periods of the year in consequence of the Trade-winds being there converted into upward currents. In the region of the Monsoons the periodicity of the rains is regulated by the distribution of land and sea and the direction of the prevailing wind. On a western coast the rainy season will coin-"], [60, "Introd 44 PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. eide with the south-west Monsoon, on an eastern coast with the north east Monsoon; and thus an island or a peninsula may have rainy seasuiis alternately on its different sides, as is the case on the peninsula of Hin dostan where the Malabar and Coromandel coasts have their rainy and dry seasons at different periods of the year On each side of the Tropics a region of variable rains coincides with the region of variable winds the variability extending to every particular\u2014 the amount of rainfall, the number of rainy days, and the direction of the rain-beanng wind. Thus the normal distribution of rains on the earth's surface embraces three divisions : \u2014 (1) The nearly constant rains of the Zone of Calms. (2) The periodical rains of all other parts of the Torrid Zone. (3) The variable rains of the extra-tropical regions. The amount ot rainfall varies extremely : at Chirra Ponyee, on the Cossya hills, in India, 615-26 inches of rain have fallen in a year, and this is, we believe, the highest amount recorded. Certain regions of the earth suffer from a deficiency, and some few from a total absence of rain. This may be attributed, either to the presence of lofty ranges of moun tains which intercept the vapours in then- passage from the sea, or to an extremely dry and bare soil combined with a hot sun, by which the atmosphere is made capable of absorbing the vapour carried to it. These conditions may, of course, exercise a joint influence. In the Old World, the Great Desert of Africa, and the Desert of Gobi in Asia, to gether with the plateaus of Iran and Arabia, which connect them, suffer greatly from want of rain. In the New World, the maritime plain ot Peru, the plateau of Mexico, and Lower California, have the same cha racter. Australia also is exposed to frequent and severe droughts. In Peru the absence of rain is due to the Andes, which intercept the clouds carried across the continent from the Atlantic. The Himalayas have a similar effect on the plateaus of Central Asia. \u00a7 11. Snow and Ice. \u2014 Snow is atmospheric moisture descending in a state of congelation, the form assumed by the particles being occasion ally granular, but more usually crystalline. Hail is frozen rain-drops, and is produced by a more violent change in the temperature of the atmosphere, connected with a peculiar electrical condition. Snow coming iu contact with a warm stratum of air is converted into rain, and hence no snow falls in the Torrid Zone, except at great elevations. The limits of its fall at the level of the sea are marked in the Map of Rains by the two lines named the Equatorial Limits of the fall of snow, on each side of which it falls with a frequency and in an amount that gradually increase as the Poles are approached. As snow requires a certain temperature to melt it, there is a limit at which it always re mains in a state of congelation, and this limit is termed the snow-line. The elevation at which this lies, varies of course with the varying tem perature of different latitudes. Within the Arctic Circles it descends to the level ofthe sea; and under the equator its normal height is about 15,000 ft. ; in 3u\u00b0 lat. it stands at 12,000 ft., and in 60\u00b0 at 4000 ft. These estimates are liable to considerable modification from local circumstances, and in some cases the snow-line rises to above 18,000 ft. This is the case in the Western Cordillera of the Andes in 16\u00b0\u2014 17J\u00b0 S. lat., where it attains a height of 18,300 ft., though in the veiy same mountains its height under the equator, near Quito, is only 15,790 ft. On the Himalaya, in about 31\u00b0 N. lat., the snow-line is higher on the northern than on the southern slope by about 4000 ft., though the latter faces the sun, and would have from its aspect a higher temperature. In the Bolivian Andes currents of hot air from the plains, in the Himalaya the radiation from"], [61, "Chap. III. BOTANICAL GEOGRAPHY. 45 the high plateau of Tibet, cause the abnormal elevation of the snow line. In mountainous countries the snow accumulates on the plateaus and in the ravines, and becomes a semi-frozen mass. The material of which this mass is formed is of a viscous character, tough, and to a certain extent fluid. Hence it descends, partly by force of gravity and partly by the mechanical pressure produced by the freezing of water in its mass, from the heights to the valleys, and there melts from the ex ternal warmth of the atmosphere and the internal warmth of the earth. The long arms of frozen snow, which thus protrude into the low valleys, are termed glaciers. \u00a7 12. Organic Life. \u2014 The distribution of Organic life (including under that term the vegetable and animal kingdoms) over the earth's surface, and the conditions which regulate that distribution, form one of the most important branches of Physical Geography; for evidently very much of the wellbeing of man depends on the natural productions of his country \u2014 on the fruits whicb it yields, and the animals which it Bupports, as well as on his own intellectual and social position. Botany, Zoology, and Ethnology thus find a place in geographical science: not that we are called upon for a scientific knowledge of these extensive and difficult subjects, but simply for a general acquaintance with their broad results in reference to the earth's surface. \u00a7 13. Botanical Geography. \u2014 From the evident differences in the organization of plants we should naturally be led to anticipate that each zone of climate would be distinguished by its own characteristic productions, and would coincide more or less exactly with a zone of vegetation. Not only is this found to be the case, but we may in troduce even finer distinctions than are implied in the divisions of torrid, temperate, and frigid ; and may map out the earth's surface into zones of much less breadth, subdividing each of the three above specified into two, and adding two new zones for the extremes of heat and cold. A map of the world constructed with this view assumes as its basis the general character of the climate, without taking into account local differences of altitude ; for temperature varies with altitude as much as with latitude, and consequently the botanical zones may be exhibited in a vertical direction (as on a mountain's side) just as faithfully as in a horizontal direction, and an arctic vegetation may be found even in a tropical region. It should also be noticed that plants exhibit different kinds of susceptibility in regard to temperature, some requiring for their perfection a certain amount of heat, while they endure a disproportionate degree of cold, others being indifferent to heat but yielding under excessive cold. Thus the limits of the botanical zones will coincide with those of extreme (the isotheral and isochimenal lines) rather than with those of mean temperature ; aud of the extremes they will coincide with the one or the other, according to the habits of each plant. The botanical zones, therefore, can only be stated generally, allowing for deviations in one direction or the other for particular plants. \u00a7 14. Zones of Vegetation. \u2014 The following table presents a comparison of the zones of Temperature and Vegetation, together with the general limits of those zones : due allowance must be made for the incidental alterations of temperature arising from the distribution of land and water and other causes of a similar nature to which we have already adverted."], [62, "Introd, 46 PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. The effect of altitude on vegetation cannot be exhibited with the same degree of completeness, inasmuch as it presupposes the existence of a mountain of enormous height in the neighbourhood of the equator, the vegetation of which had been thoroughly examined. Various obser- vations have, however, been made in different parts of the world which serve to elucidate this view of the subject. The peak of Teneriffe exhibits six botanical zones, the altitudes and characteristic produc- tions of which are: \u2014 (1) From the sea-level to 1248 feet, palms and bananas. (2) 1248-2748 feet, evergreens. (3) 2748-4350 feet, decidu- ous trees. (4) 4350-6270 feet, pines. (5) 6270-11,061 feet, broom and low flowering-plants. (6) 11,061-12,180 feet, lichens and mosses. The varying limits of the region of trees in different latitudes furnishes a similar criterion : in Lapland the region ceases at an elevation of 500 feet; in Norway, at 3500 ; in the Alps, at 6000 feet ; and in the Andes, at about 12,000 feet. Within the limits, horizontal and vertical, thus assigned to certain classes, each plant has its own special area or habitat, to which it is naturally restricted. Hence a more minute sub- division of tbe earth's surface may be made, based on the occurrence of a peculiar flora in a given area. This is the principle of Schouw's division of the earth into 24 botanical regions. \u00a7 15. Distribution of Bread-plants. \u2014 The plants chiefly serviceable for substantial food, and hence termed bread-plants * whether in the form ot grain, root, or fruit, are unequally distributed over the earth's surface, and are best arranged in separate zones for each continent. (1) Com- mencing with the cereals, the zone of Barley and Oats extends north- wards in western Europe to 70\u00b0 N. lat., in Western Asia to 60\u00b0, in Eastern Asia to 51\u00b0, and in America to 58\u00b0 on the western and 50\u00b0 on the eastern coast. Southwards the zone extends to the Tropic of Cancer. The zone of Wlieat in the Eastern Hemisphere attains its most northerly point (57\u00b0) in the British Isles ; its limit eastward follows the south coast of the Baltic and is carried on in the same latitude to about 62\u00b0 E. long. ; thence it descends to the Black Sea, and keeps south of the Caucasus range and the Caspian to the borders of India. In the west the southern limit of the Wheat Zone extends to the Atlas range in Africa, but does not descend south of that range. In Asia the Tropic of Cancer may be regarded as its limit, though at 1 A \" bread-plant \" is defined by Schouw to be such as contains, in one or more parts of m J,tmCtUre' \" sufflcient abundance of starch to furnish an essential article of food for Zone of Temperature.

BREAD-PLANTS. 47 certain elevations it will thrive in tropical regions. In America the zone of wheat extends from 50\u00b0 N. lat. in the west and 45\u00b0 N. lat. in the east, to 30\u00b0 N. lat. in the south. Maize occupies partly the same zone as wheat, ascending northwards to 50\u00b0 N. lat. in the Eastern, and 45\u00b0 in the Western Hemisphere; southwards it extends to the Equator and even below it to the Tropic of Capricorn in South America. Rice occupies a very large area, including the whole of Africa, Asia south of the Himalayan range and its continuations to the Yellow Sea, Carolina in North America, and Brazil in South America. In the Southern Hemisphere the European cereals reappear at the Cape of Good Hope ; in the Australian Colonies ; and in New Zealand. (2) Of roots, the Potato is by far the most widely spread : in Europe it grows at Hammerfest in 70\u00b0 N. lat., and its limit in Asia nowhere descends below 60\u00b0 : in America the limit varies from about 63\u00b0 in the west to 50\u00b0 in the east ; southwards its zone extends to about 30\u00b0 N. lat. In the Southern Hemisphere the potato is again found between 25\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 S. lat. Between the two zones already described, there intervenes a central tropical region occupied by the Manioc, Batata, Arum, and Yam, the first of which flourishes in Carolina, South Texas, Central America, and South America to the Tropic of Capricorn, and in West Africa, from about 20\u00b0 N. lat. to 20\u00b0 S. lat. ; the second, otherwise known as the Sweet Potato, in the East Indies, the Indian Archipelago, Polynesia, and Central America ; the third, in the same region; and the fourth in Western Africa, the Indian Archipelago, Polynesia, and New Zealand. (3) Of fruits used as substantial food the most note worthy are : \u2014 The Date Palm, in Northern Africa, Arabia, Persia, Syria, and the extreme South of Europe (Sicily, Malta, and the southern coast of Spain) ; the Bread-fruit, in the Indian Archipelago and the South Sea Islands; the Plantain and Banana, in various parts of the tropical regions (South China, Indian Archipelago, Polynesia, Central America); the Sago Palm, the pith, not the fruit, of which supplies material for bread to the inhabitants of the Indian Archipelago ; and the Cocoa Palm, which grows in most maritime tropical districts. The value of these plants as food-producers may be estimated from the following facts : \u2014 A plot of ground planted with plantains will yield 133 times more food than a plot of the same size planted with wheat: three bread-fruit trees will support a person through the year, and a sago palm will yield about 500 lbs. or 600 lbs. of meal. \u00a7 16. Distribution of Plants used as Luxuries.\u2014 VlaxAs producing articles used as luxuries, whether for eating, drinking, or narcotic purposes, hold a most important place in commerce. The Vine is a native of the Temperate Zone, requiring for its perfection a summer temperature exceeding 65\u00b0, but at the same time capable of enduring severe winter cold. In Europe its northern limit reaches 47\u00a3\u00b0 N. lat. on the west coast, 51\u00b0 on the Rhine, and 48\u00b0-49\u00b0 in Hungary ; in Asia, 46\u00b0, in the neighbourhood of the Caspian Sea and in Bokhara, its cultivation not extending eastward of the Suleiman range ; in North America, 42\u00b0 bn the western, aud 46\u00b0 on the eastern coast. The southern limit of its zone as a wine-producing plant in the Northern Hemi sphere may be placed at the tropic of Cancer. In the Southern Hemisphere the vine again flourishes in the Temperate Zone ; in South America, in Chili as far south as 40\u00b0, and on the River Plate; in Africa, at the Cape ; and in Australia. We may further specify the following plants: \u2014 Tea, the culture of which is almost monopolised by China, though it has been successfully grown in Assam (North"], [64, "PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. Introd. 48 India), Java, and Cochin China. Coffee, which grows to great perfection in South Arabia, Ceylon, Abyssinia, and other parts of Africa, bugar. cane, a tropical plant chiefly cultivated in the West Indies Brazil, Mauritius, and Java, adapted to a mean temperature ot 77-84 hahr., but admitting of cultivation at as low a temperature as 67 . Spices, almost confined to the Indian Archipelago. Tobacco, largely grown in the western, central, and southern parts of Europe, but attaining its highest perfection in the tropical regions of America, in the West Indies, the Philippines, Turkey, and Java. Opium, produced in India, chiefly for the use of the Chinese and Malays; and lastly, Betel-nut, the produce of the Areca palm, largely used as a narcotic in Eastern Asia and the Indian Archipelago. \u00a7 17. Distribution of Animals. \u2014 The distribution of animals over the earth's surface is even more irregular than that of plants, certain species occupying areas of very limited extent, while most are restricted by longitudinal as well as latitudinal limits. It is therefore hardly pos sible to represent the distribution by zones, in the strict sense of the term : at the same time, the zones of temperature have their charac teristic features in this as in other respects ; for we may notice, as far as beasts and birds are concerned, a descending gradation in size, virulence, beauty, fecundity, and vital power from tbe Equator to the Poles. Thus, for instance, the lion and the tiger of the Torrid Zone are repre sented by the small and domesticated cat of the Temperate Zone ; and the crocodile of the former by the lizard of the latter ; while in the Arctic regions those animals are wholly unrepresented. Of the serpent tribe the Torrid Zone possesses the gigantic Boa and many virulently venomous species, while the Temperate Zone possesses only the small Viper and various harmless species. So again with regard to birds, their plumage in the Tropical regions is brilliant and varied ; in the Temperate Zone, varied but sober ; in the Arctic regions, of a uniformly dull hue. An exception to this general rule must be made in regard to the tenants of the sea, which are as numerous, vigorous, and large in the Arctic Seas as elsewhere. Insects, moreover, which depend more on extreme heat than on mean temperature, are remark ably abundant during the short but hot summer of the Polar regions. Reverting from latitude to longitude, it may be observed that the Eastern surpasses the Western World in the character and size of its auimals. Most ofthe domesticated animals (the horse, the ox, the dog, the pig) belong, properly speaking, to the former, and have been intro duced into the latter within recent times. Even where the same species are represented in each, those of the Western Hemisphere are smaller ; as may be seen by comparing the puma with the lion, the llama with the camel, or the jaguar with the leopard. The most valuable of the do mesticated animals occupy the following areas : \u2014 The Reindeer, north wards from 50\u00b0 N. lat. in Eastern Asia and Western America, and from 62\u00b0 in Western Europe ; the Horse, from 66\u00b0 N. Lat. in Western Europe, but elsewhere rarely above 60\u00b0, to 55\u00b0 S. lat. ; the Sheep, throughout the Temperate aud Torrid Zones, without any definite limit northwards ; the Ox, as far north as 70\u00b0 in Western Europe, and 55\u00b0 in North America, and thence through the Tropical regions to about 55\u00b0 S. lat. ; the Dog, northward to 70\u00b0 and southward to the extremity of the American continent ; the Pig, everywhere in the Temperate and sub-tropical regions of the world ; the Camd, in the desert regions of Asia and Africa between 10\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 N. lat. ; the Elephant, in the Tropical regions of Asia and Africa ; the Llama, in"], [65, "Chap. Ill HUMAN RACE. 49 the high Andes of South America ; and the Yak, on the high lands of Central Asia. \u00a7 18. Man. \u2014 The human race, for whose use the world was formed and furnished with its varied order3 and degrees of organic life, vin dicates the position assigned to it by its wonderful adaptation to varia tions of climate, food, and habits of life. While other species of animals are restricted to certain areas, and these sometimes of very limited extent, man finds himself as capable of living under the equatorial sun as amid polar snows. Continent and island, plain and plateau, valley and mountain-top, all find tenants to whom their own particular loca lity seems most suitable. And yet the unity ofthe race is undoubted ; there is but one species, though within that species there are numerous varieties; ethnological research tends to the confirmation of the Biblical statement that \"God hath made of one blood all nations of men\" CActs xvii. 26). What may be the total population of the world at the 23. Map os Varieties of Human Bace. present time, is of course a mere matter of conjecture ; it is generally supposed to exceed 1000 millions, and may be put according to the most probable computation at 1200 millions. The numerous well defined differences of appearance and physical conformation, such as the colour of the skin, the texture of the hair, the shape of the skull, and the facial angle, have led to classifications of the varieties of the human species, differing in number and principle. We shall adopt a sixfold division into the Caucasian, Mongolian, Negro, Malayan, Ame rican, and Australian, the characteristics and areas of which we proceed to describe. (1) The Caucasian race is distinguished by an oval skull, a facial angle of about 80\u00b0, a generally fair complexion, verging, however, in the southern members of the division, to a yellowish or brownish hue, flowing hair, and an abundant beard.

Outside these families the marks of relationship are less definitely marked, but certain similarities of structure suggest the idea of radical affinity, and the term Turanian has been applied to the large class not included under the two former designations. Within the limits of Europe the agglutinative class is represented by the Turkish, Magyar, Finnish, and perhaps the Basque languages. Of all the families the Indo-European is the one in which we are most interested. The numerous languages belonging to it may be further classified under the following heads: \u2014 (1) The Indian; of which Sanscrit, the ancient language of that country, is the leading example. (2) The Iranian or Persian. (3) The Celtic; of which there are two forms, the Erse or Gaelic, and the Cymric or Welsh. (4) The Gr\u00e6co-Latin ; which includes not only the ancient Greek and Latin, but the numerous modern languages connected with the latter. (5) The Teutonic ; subdivided into the German and Scandinavian branches, and German again into High German and Low German, to which latter our own tongue belongs, while the former is the German of literature. (6) The Slavonian. (7) The Lithuanian ; which is chiefly valuable in a linguistic point of view, the use of it being very restricted. The areas over which these various branches prevail will be described in a subsequent chapter. The population speaking Indo- European languages is estimated at 400 millions, and is constantly increasing. The Shemitic population numbers only 30 millions, and is stationary. \u00a7 20. Religion. \u2014 Next to language, Religion forms the strongest bond of social and. political union. At the present time, four religions hold a prominent place in the affairs of the world, viz : \u2014 Christianity, Mohammedanism, Brahminism, and Buddhism. (1.) Christianity holds the first place in point of political and social influence. It prevails over nearly the whole of Europe, and wherever in other parts of the world Europeans have settled. In Asia it has a footing in Syria, Armenia, Mesopotamia, and wherever Armenians have settled ; there is also an ancient, though decayed, branch on the Malabar coast. In Africa, it is represented only by the Coptic church of Egypt and by the Abyssinian church. The Christian world is divided into numerous bodies with their distinctive doctrines and organizations. Of these the most power ful are, \u2014 (1) The Roman Catholic, which is dominant in Southern and Western Europe, Ireland, and South America, and has numerous adherents elsewhere. (2) The Greek church, in Russia, Greece, Turkey, and parts of Austria. (3) The Reformed or Protestant churches, the most important branches of which are the Lutheran in Germany and Scandinavia ; the Anglican in England ; and the Presbyterian in Scotland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and France ; each of these branches being represented wherever in foreign lands colonies have been founded by the inhabitants of these countries. Christianity is supposed to number from 320 to 350 millions of adherents, about half of whom belong to the Roman Catholic church, while the remaining half is divided in about equal proportions between the Greek and the Reformed churches. (2.) Mohammedanism is dominant, to the exclu sion of all other religions, in Arabia, where it had its birth (a.d. 622), and where its sacred capital, Mecca, is situated ; it is also the received faith of the Turks, of the majority of the tribes of Western Asia and Northern Africa, and of vast numbers in India and the East generally. It is supposed to number 120 millions of adherents. (3.) Brahminism D a"], [68, "52 PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY.

Position, Dimensions, and Boundaries of Europe. \u2014 Europe is the north-western division of the Old World, and probably owes its name (from the Shemitio word ereb \" sunset \" or \" west \") to its position in reference to Asia. It is by far the smallest"], [70, "Book I. 54 EUROPE. of the three great divisions, being about one-third of the size of Africa, and less than one-fourth of that of Asia. In this respect, indeed, it might be regarded merely as a peninsular extension of the latter continent. It stretches through 35 degrees of latitude and 78 of longitude, the extreme points on the continent itself, irrespective of the adjacent islands, being : \u2014 N., Cape Nordkyn, in Norway, 71\u00b0 6' N. lat.; S., Cape Tarifa, in Spain, 36\u00b0 1' N. lat. ; W., Cape Eoca, in Portugal, 9\u00b0 30' W. long. ; and E., Kara1 Bay, 68\u00b0 3(y E. long. On three sides Europe is bounded by seas, viz. : \u2014 N., by the Arctic Sea ; W., by the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean ; and S., by the Mediterranean. On the E. the boundary is partly fixed by nature, viz. : by the Archipelago, the Black Sea, and the intermediate waters, in the S. ; and, in the N, by the Ural range. This latter forms the natural boundary as far S. as 51\u00b0 N. lat., hut the Russian provinces of Perm and Orenburg overstep it between the 62nd and 51st parallels. S. of the Ural range Europe and Asia are connected by a broad isthmus of neutral ground, serving as an open gate between them, across which the boundary might be carried either to the Sea of Azov, or to the Caspian : 2 the latter is now the recognized boundary. Between the Caspian and the Black Seas Caucasus supplies a natural boundary, and this should be retained, although the Russians include their Trans-Caucasian provinces in Europe. The extreme length of the continent is estimated at about 3400 m. ; its breadth at about 2400 m. ; its coast-line at 20,000 m. ; and its area at about 3,800,000 sq. m. In the latter are included certain islands which from their position form integral portions of the continent, such as the British Isles off the N.W. coast ; Sicily off the S. point of Italy ; Corsica and Sardinia, attached respectively to France and Italy ; and the Balearic Isles, belonging to Spain. \u00a7 2. General Characteristics. \u2014 Europe is distinguished from the other continents by peculiarities of position and configuration mostly of a favourable character. (1) It occupies a central position in the terrestrial hemisphere, which adapts it to social and commer cial intercourse. It adjoins Asia along its whole E. frontier : it ap proximates to Africa at the Strait of Gibraltar and between Sicily and Cape Bon, and has access by sea to its W. coast : and it faces the great western continent of America with an unimpeded navi gation to it. (2) Its outline is singularly varied by inland seas and peninsulas. Hence arises the great extent of its coast-line as com pared with its area : hence also the disproportion existing between 1 This assumes that the boundary in the extreme N.E. is carried along the course of the Kara Balgarama river. Sometimes the Kara is regarded as the limit. 2 In the former case the edge of the elevated ground called the Obtschei-Sirt, leading to the Volga and the Don, and in the latter case the river Ural, would furnish the boundary line; geographically, tha former is preferable."], [71, "Chap.

(3) Its internal configuration is also varied ; with the exception of the great plain of the eastern region, it possesses a diversified surface of hills, valleys, and plains, none of them on a large scale \u2014 the mountains of moderate height, the valleys and plains of proportionably moderate length and breadth. (4) The external and internal configuration are alike favourable to intercommunication : the seas penetrate deeply into the interior : no central mass of table-land, no expanse of desert interposes a barrier between the different quarters: the rivers are numerous and approximate one another at their sources. (5) The climate is temperate and equable : the western districts enjoy an oceanic temperature with a sufficiency of moisture ; the eastern plain has a more continental climate but not to an abnormal degree ; and in the southern districts the heat incidental to their latitude is modified by the presence of water and mountains. (6) Table-lands are rare, and of no great height or extent. \u00a7 3. Seas. \u2014 The seas of Europe belong partly to the Arctic, partly to the Atlantic Ocean-basins. Of these two the latter exercises a pre dominating influence, as may be gathered from the extent of coast line belonging to each, viz. : to the Arctic Ocean with its inland seas 3600 m., to the Atlantic with its seas 16,400 m. The extent of coast abutting directly on the oceans is, however, small as compared with that on the inclosed seas. The Arctic Ocean washes the N. coasts of Russia and Norway ; and the open Atlantic the W. coasts of Spain and Portugal. The Bay of Biscay, and the North Sea are semi-inclosed portions of the Atlantic, the former between the coasts of France and Spain, the latter connected with it in one direction by the English Channel and the Strait of Dover, in another by the broad outlet between Scotland and Norway. The English Channel washes the N. coast of France ; and the North Sea, the coasts of Bel gium, Holland, N. W. Germany, Denmark, and Norway. The inclosed seas are : \u2014 (1) The White Sea, an arm of the Arctic Ocean, in Russia. (2) The Baltic (Germ. Ostsee, i. e. \" East Sea \"), connected with the North Sea by a series of channels, viz : the Sk gerrack between Norway and Denmark, the Kattegat between Sweden and Denmark, and the three channels leading out of the latter into the Baltic, viz.: the Sound, the Great Belt, and the Little Belt; the first between Sweden and Zealand, the second between Zealand and Fiinen, and the third between Fiinen and Schleswig. The Baltic terminates inland in two long arms, the Gulf of Bothnia, between Russia and Sweden, and the Gulf of Finland, wholly in Bussia; the Gulf of Riga, also in Russia, is a deep and wide inlet S. of the Gulf of Finland. (3) The Mediterranean, the most important, both"], [73, "57 Chap. I SEAS. physically and politically, of all the inland seas. Westward it is con nected with the Atlantic by the Strait of Gibraltar (17 m. across at its narrowest point), and eastward with the Black Sea by the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmora, and the Strait of Constantinople. In the S. E. angle it approaches the Red Sea, with which it will ere long be connected by an artificial channel. As the great high-road of Eastern commerce, its value to European nations is beyond all estimate. It is divided into two basins, Western and Eastern, by the approximation of Sicily to Cape Bon in Africa. The Western protrudes northwards, forming the Gulfs of Lions and Genoa : it washes the coasts of Spain, France, and Italy ; and it contains the islands of Corsica and Sardinia, between which and the peninsula of Italy is the semi-inclosed Tyrrhenian Sea. The Eastern basin contains two seas, which, in respect to the Mediterranean itself, may be regarded as inclosed seas, viz. : the Adriatic, which divides the peninsulas of Italy and Greece, and the Archipelago, which divides Greece from Asia Minor. It contains Candia, together with many other islands of smaller size : that portion of it which lies outside of the Adriatic Sea between S. Italy and Greece is named the Ionian Sea. (4) The Black Sea, connected with the Mediterranean by the channels already enumerated, and with its own inclosed gulf, the Sea of Azov, by the Strait of Yenikale. The Black Sea washes the coasts of Russia and Turkey. (5) The Caspian Sea, which belongs geographically to Asia but politically to Europe, inasmuch as it is under Russian control. It has no outlet to the ocean and lies in a deep depression, its surface being 83 ft. below the level of the Black Sea. Size, character, &c, of ihe inland seas. \u2014 The importance of the inland seas depends, partly on their own extent and character, and partly on the extent and character of the countries whose waters they receive. The following table conveys information on some of these topics : \u2014 The White Sea is unnavigable during the winter months in con sequence of ice : it owes its name to its appearance at that season of the 8 The length here assigned to the Baltic is taken in a direct line from the Stettiner Haff ta the S. to Torneo in the N\".

The Medi terranean is a chasm of immense depth: at Nice it sinks down ab ruptly 700 fathoms close to the shore, and between the 17th and 19th meridians is 2170 fathoms deep: submarine plateau between the Eastern and Western basins: tides perceptible only in a few places, spring tides rising 1 ft. at Naples, 5 ft. at Venice: winds generally variable, and violent gusts near the high lands and islands : the shores of the Mediterranean the home of ancient civilization and commerce ; its importance lessened by the discovery of the route to the East round the Cape of Good Hope, but restored in some degree by the immense advance of our Eastern traffic by the overland route. The Black Sea is deep in the centre with shelving sides ; free from islands and shoals : brackish water : violent, but brief, storms : no tides : the Black Sea the great thoroughfare for Eastern commerce, between the 10th and 13th centuries, to Constantinople and the Adriatic commercial cities. The Caspian Sea is shallow in its N. portion, but deepens southward: shores generally low, particularly in the E. : violent and prolonged gales which drive the waters inland for miles : water moderately salt. \u00a7 4. Peninsulas. \u2014 The peninsulas form a most important feature in the outline of Europe. They occupy no less than one fourth of the whole area, and protrude equally from its several seaboards. The normal figure of the continent (exclusive of the peninsulas) approximates to a triangle, the three angles of which are situated at the S. extremity of the Bay of Biscay, at the Sea of Azov, and at the N. extremity of the Ural range. The importance, not only in respect to area but still more as to political influence, of the members lying outside this normal figure will be at once perceived. The peninsulas may be classed under two heads as primary and secondary: of the first class there are 4 : \u2014 (1) The Scandinavian (Norway and Sweden), between the North Sea, the Arctic Ocean, and the Baltic (Gulf of Bothnia) ; its E. limit might otherwise be extended to the Gulf of Finland and the White Sea, with the intervening chain of lakes. (2) The Iberian (Spain and Portugal), connected with the mainland by the broad isthmus between the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean. (3) The Italian, between the Tyrrhenian and the Adriatic Seas of the Mediterranean, and shut off from the rest of Europe by the Alps, which curve round between those two seas. (4) The Balkan peninsula (Greece and part of Turkey), between the Adriatic on the W., the Archipelago and the Sea of Marmora on the E., and the Balkan range on the N. Of the secondary peninsulas"], [75, "Chap. I. CONFIGURATION OF SURFACE. 59 we may notice : \u2014 (1) Jutland, which projects northwards between the Kattegat and the North Sea, and is the only peninsula in Europe which takes that direction. (2) Brittany, in the N. W. angle of France, between the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay. (3) Istria, at the head of the Adriatic Sea. (4) The Crimea, be tween the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, connected with the main land by the isthmus of Perekop. Promontories. \u2014 The most salient points on the mainland are : \u2014 Kanin Nos, at the entrance of the White Sea ; the Naze, at the entrance of the Skagerrack ; the Skaw, at the N. point of Jutland ; Capes Ortegal and Finisterre, at the N. W. angle of Spain ; C. St. Vincent, at the S. W. angle of Portugal ; C. Tarifa, in Spain, on the Strait of Gibraltar ; C. Gata, also in Spain, the point where the Mediterranean begins to assume the form of a channel ; C. Spartivento, the S. point of the Italian peninsula ; C. di Leuca, the S. E. point of the same ; C. Matapan, the S. point of Greece ; and C. Malea, adjacent to it. In many instances the headlands of islands closely contiguous to the mainland become virtually the terminations of the peninsulas : thus North Cape, in Mageroe, is frequently regarded as the extremity of the Scandinavian peninsula ; Ushant serves as the point of Brittany ; and Sicily with C. Passaro, at its S. angle, as the extremity of Italy. \u00a7 5. Configuration op Subface. \u2014 In regard to the configuration of its surface, or its relief, the most marked features in the aspect of the continent are these: \u2014 1. A vast lowland plain, extending from the North Sea to the Ural Mountains, as broad as the con tinent itself at its E. extremity, but narrowed towards the W. by the approximation of the mountains of Central Europe to the Baltic and the North Sea. 2. A continuous mountain wall, running in the direction of the length of the continent W. and E. from the Gulf of Genoa to the Black Sea, the chief links in the chain being the Alps in the W. and the Balkan in the E., with the Dinaric Alps and other chains as intermediate links. 3. The subordinate ranges of the Apen nines and Pindus, connected with the great dorsal chain just described and forming the back-bones of the peninsulas of Italy and Greece respectively. 4. A series of mountain chains projecting northwards into central Europe in the direction of the Baltic. The area enclosed by these chains approximates in shape to a triangle, having the Alps as its base and the Harz mountains (between 51\u00b0 30' and 52\u00b0 N. lat.) as its apex, the E. flank being formed by the Eiesengebirge, the Sudetes, and the Carpathians, and the W. flank by the Eifel, the Vosges, Jura, and the Cevennes. Within this area are ranges forming subordinate systems, which will be noticed hereafter. 5. The Pyrenean system, which forms the framework of the Iberian peninsula, the Pyrenees themselves holding the same general direction as the Alps, and apparently forming a westerly continuation of that great chain, with the Ce'vennes as its connecting link. The"], [76, "EUROPE. CooK I 60 chains which traverse the highland of Spain have a general S.W. direction, and form a link between the European and North African (Atlas) systems. 6. The insulated ranges of (1) the Scandinavian peninsula in the N. ; (2) Ural in the N. E.; and (3) Caucasus in the S.E., the two first having a general N. and S. direction, the last crossing'the isthmus between the Black and Caspian Seas. The islands of Corsica and Sardinia appear from their direction to be con nected with the Maritime Alps, and the British Isles with the Scandinavian system, while Sicily belongs unquestionably to the Apennines. 2u. Summit of Mont Blanc. \u00a7 6. Alpine System. \u2014 Among the mountains of Europe, the Alps hold the first place, not only on account of their extent and grandeur, but also from their position in reference to the powerful nations of Western Europe. The high Alps themselves, which form the nucleus of the system, extend from the Col di Tenda in the W. to the Gross Glockner (12\u00b0 43' E. long.) in tho E., a distance of 420 m. ; but the subordinate ranges are continued beyond the latter point to the Danube in one direction, and along the shore of the Adriatic Sea in another. The breadth of the Alps varies from 50 to 150 m., the line being restricted to a single chain in the W., and ramifying as it proceeds eastward. The loftiest summits are found"], [77, "Chap. I. ALPINE SYSTEM. 61 within the Pennine portion of the chain (about 60 m. long), as 6hown in the subjoined table, Mont Blanc (15,784 ft.) being the culminating point. The southern slope of the Alps is more abrupt than the northern. The main routes cross the chain at the points where depressions occur in the crest. In the Rh\u00e6tian Alps such passes are numerous, but in the more westerly parts of the chain they are rare. The Balkan, properly so called, is the range which bounds the plains of the lower Danube between the 23rd and 28th meridians ; more usually, however, the name is extended to the whole line of heights which extends westward between the 42nd and 43rd parallels, to the junction of the Dinaric Alps, a distance of about 600 m. The Balkan proper, though not nearly so lofty as the Alps or Pyrenees, is so broad and rugged as to interpose an almost insurmountable barrier between the N. and S. The westerly con tinuation culminates in Egrisu ( Orbelus), about 9000 ft. high. A lateral range connects Balkan with the Carpathians at Orsova on the Danube. The Dinaric Alps are so named from their highest moun tain, the Dinara, about 6000 ft. high : they skirt the Adriatic Sea from 42\u00b0 N. lat. to Segna, where they meet the Julian Alps. Divisions, Peaks, and Passes of the Alps. \u2014 The Alps may be divided into 3 great portions, Western, Central, and Eastern, the first including all that lies W. of Mont Blanc, the third all that lies E. of the sources of the Inn, and the second the intermediate ranges. More usually, however, the ancient subdivisions of the Alps are retained by geo graphers, and these may be conveniently combined with the larger division as follows : \u2014 1. The Western Alps, embracing (1) The Maritime A., from Altare,5 N.W. of Savona, to Monte Viso, with an important westerly offset known as the Alps of Dauphiny. (2) The Cottian A., from Monte Viso to Mont Cenis. (3) The Graian A., from Mont Cenis to Mont Blanc. 2. The Central Alps, embracing (4) The Pennine A., from Mont Blanc to Monte Rosa, with a parallel range known as the Bernese Alps, divided from the primary range by the valley of the Rhone. (5) The Lepontian A., from Monte Rosa to Mont Maloja, with three subordinate ranges issuing from it, one proceeding N. to the Lake of Lucerne, a second (the Todi chain) N.E. along the left bank of the upper Rhine, and the third between the upper streams of the Rhine and the Inn. 3.

The length of the range is about 800 m., and its cul minating point, II Gran Sasso, is 10,154 ft. high. The mountains of Central Europe fall into several minor groups or systems, of which the following deserve notice. (1) The Carpathian system, which bounds on the N. the great plain of Hungary, and is composed of the Great Carpa thians, Jablunka, and the Little Carpathians ; this system connects with the Alpine at its two extremities, viz., E. with a branch of the Dinaric Alps near Orsova, and W. with a continuation of the Styrian Alps near Vienna.

Pyrenees, &c. \u2014 Of the secondary systems noticed in \u00a7 5 a brief notice will suffice. (1) The Pyrenees, which shut off the Iberian peninsula from the mass of the continent, have a length of 270 m. between Cape Creux and the Pass of Passages in Guipuzcoa ; a breadth varying from 60 m. in the centre to 20 m. at its E. ex tremity ; and a mean height of 8000 ft. in the central range, with the Pio de Nethou (11,168 ft.) as their culminating point. The S. slope is more abrupt than the N. ; the snow-line lies at 8311 ft. on the former, and 9269 ft. on the latter; glaciers are numerous, but comparatively small. The Pyrenees are continued westward, under the came of the Cantabrian Mountains, to the N.W. angle of Spain. (2) The Scandinavian system is distinguished in its southern and most important division by the breadth of its highlands, which are characteristically described as \" Fjelds \" or \" fields,\" such as the Dovre- Fjeld and the Hardanger-Fjeld. The average height of these Fjelds is 4000 ft., and out of them rise various culminating points, such as Galdhoppigen (8400 ft.), Skagstolstind (8101 ft.), and others. As the system advances northwards, it contracts to a single range, known as the Kiolen mountains, the height diminishing gradually from S. to N. (3) The Ural system consists of numerous parallel ele vations, which, N. of the 60th parallel, attain an average height of 3000 ft., but S. of that limit are lower. Its breadth may be about 100 m., and the slopes on either side are very gradual, giving it the appearance of a plateau rather than a ridge. A northerly continua tion of Ural, named the Poyas Mountains, terminates on the shores of the Strait of Waigatz. (4) Caucasus has a wholly different character from Ural; it consists of a well defined central ridge, rising in Elbruz to a height of 18,493 ft., with rugged and lofty spurs pro truding from it transversely into the subjacent lowlands. \u00a7 8. Plateaus. \u2014 It has been already stated that plateaus or broad masses of elevated land are of comparatively rare occurrence in Europe. The only one indeed of important dimensions is that of Spain, which occupies about half of the peninsula, and stands at an elevation of from 2000 to 3000 ft. above the sea. These highlands are buttressed N. by the Cantabrian range, E. by the elevations that bound the valley of the Ebro on the W., and S. by the Sierra Morena : west ward they decline towards the Atlantic. The surface is varied ; extensive plains occur in parts, but the greater part of it is rugged, and lofty ranges intersect the interior from N.E. to S.W. Transylvania, lying embosomed in the circuit of the Carpathians, furnishes another instance of an elevated plateau ; it is remarkably rugged, and plains are rare. The whole of the region lying within the secondary ranges of the Alpine system is more or less elevated,"], [80, "Book I. 64 EUROPE. but there is no portion, unless it be Bohemia, which assumes the distinctive form of a plateau. The elevation of Central Europe may be estimated from the following data: \u2014 the Lake of Constance is 1344 ft. above the sea ; Passau on the Danube, 800 ft. ; Kdniggratz, on the Elbe in Bohemia, 618 ft. ; and Pirna, on the same river just where it emerges from Bohemia, 287 ft. \u00a7 9. Plains. \u2014The great plain of Europe occupies an area of about 2,500,000 sq. m., or nearly two-thirds of the whole continent. It may be regarded as divided into two portions by the Vistula, viz., the Russian or Sarmatian to the E., and the German to the W. of that river. The Russian plain is not without distinctly marked differences of level; two broad, but low, plateaus cross it from W. to E., one between the Ural and Carpathian ranges, the other between Ural and the Baltic. The former, the Uralo-Carpathian table-land, is connected with the S. extremity of the Ural range, and is interrupted by the courses of the Volga and the Dnieper. The latter, which may be termed the Uralo-Baltic table-land, con tains the Valdai heights, on which the Volga, Diina, and Dnieper take their rise. The first and last of these rivers soon reach the lower plain, the height of which above the sea at Twer is only 390 ft., and at Nischnei-Novgorod, only 230 ft. Near the Caspian the plain sinks even below the level of the sea. Between the Caspian and the Black Seas and from the river Ural to the Dnieper the plain is a steppe, utterly devoid of trees, and in places also of water, yielding luxuriant herbage in spring, but at other times parched either with extreme heat or extreme cold. The lesser plains of Europe are either river-basins or maritime plains : in the first class we may notice the fine plain of Lombardy, occupying the greater part of the basin of the Po ; the plains of Hungary and Wallachia along the course of the Danube ; and the plain of the Upper Rhine. Maritime plains are found in strips or amphithea trical basins of varying size in all places where the coast is not rocky. The plain of Holland is of a peculiar character, the formation of art as much as of nature, the sea and rivers being excluded hy means of gigantic dykes, and a soil thus seemed which has been deposited by the Bhine in past ages : Holland is, in short, the Delta of that river. \u00a7 10. Volcanic Agency. \u2014 Volcanic agency manifests itself in Europe in various ways, but not so widely or so violently as about the shores of the Pacific. Active volcanoes exist only in the basin of the Mediterranean, and in the remote islands of Iceland and Jan Meyen in the North Atlantic. In the former, Vesuvius near Naples, \u00c6tna in Sicily, and Stromboli in the Lipari islands, may he noticed; in Iceland, Hecla and Or\u00e6fa Jokul. The Geysers in Iceland are another effect of volcanic agency. Earthquakes are not"], [81, "VOLCANIC AGENCY. 65 Chap. I. uncommon, but they are generally slight ; the great earthquake of Lisbon in 1755, which extended to the extremity of northern Europe, and that of Calabria in 1783, which was restricted to parts of Italy are the most notorious exceptions to the general rule. The presence of volcanic agency in previous stages of the earth's history is attested by numerous proofs, but nowhere more remarkably than in Auvergne, where whole groups of dome-shaped mountains have been thrown up, some exhibiting indications of having been in a state of active eruption, others with craters regularly formed from which no lava has issued, and others again without craters. Many of the islands of the Archipelago owe their existence to volcanic agency, St. Santorin6 furnishing the most remarkable example. A further 27. \u00c6tna, from Beggio, effect of volcanic agency is manifested in the changes noticeable in the level of the land. There can be no doubt that Scotland has been considerably elevated within the historical period ; but the coasts of the Baltic furnish a yet more remarkable instance. N. of 56\u00b0 3' N. lat., the level of the land is rising, and S. of that limit it is falling ; at the North Cape it rises 5 ft. in a century, at Stockholm 3 inches, while in Scania it is sinking.7 6 This island is nothing else than a sec tion of the edge of a crater. A new island has been thrown up in the present year (1866) in the centre of the crater be tween Santorin and Therasia. 7 The reported alterations in the level of the Baltic ou the Prussian coast at Memel, Konigsberg, and Pillau, appear to be of a temporary character, the result of strong prevailing winds."], [82, "EUROPE. Book I. 66 \u00a7 11. Hydrography.\u2014 The river system of Europe, though on a comparatively small scale, is remarkably perfect as regards both drainage and communication, the rivers being very numerous and so completely intersecting the continent that the intervals between the headwaters of streams running in different directions are trifling. The rivers Danube, Bhine, and Bhone, for instance, diverge from the same quarter in different directions to the Black Sea, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean ; the upper streams of the Volga inter lace with those of the Dwina and the Diina, one of which seeks the White Sea, the other the Baltic. The slopes of the continent may he distinguished, according to their extent, as primary and secondary. There are two primary slopes, viz. : towards the S.E. and towards the N.W., the former comprising the basins of the Black and Caspian Seas, the latter those of the North Sea, the Baltic, and the White Sea. The water-shed or line that divides these slopes, if laid down on the map, would assume a tortuous course. It would commence in the Alps at the sources of the Bhine, would follow the E. boundary of that river basin to the sources of the Danube in the Schwartzwald, then the ranges that bound the Danube basin as far as the sources of the Dniester, and thence would cross the Great Plain diagonally by the Valdai hills to the sources of the Petchora and the Kama. The secondary slopes are those which belong to the Mediterranean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean. The basin of the Medi terranean is shut off from the bulk of the continent by the great ranges of the Alpine system ; the normal direction of its slope is from N. to S. as exhibited in the Bhone and the great feeders of the Po, but it is rarely that this slope attains any extension. The direct Atlantic slope is towards the W., and is limited to France and a portion of the Iberian peninsula. The Arctic slope is towards the N., and is of small extent. It has been already remarked in \u00a7 3 that the inland seas possess much more extensive land-basins than the oceans. The total area assigned to the former amounts to 2,900,000 sq. m., leaving only 900,000 sq. m. as the joint area of the direct Atlantic and Arctic basins, including in the former the semi-inclosed North Sea. This results from two circumstances :\u2014 (1) That the great plain is shut off from the Atlantic by the position of the northerly members of the Alpine system ; and (2) That the slope of the great plain itself is not towards the Arctic Ocean, as in Asia, but in the opposite direction. The effect of this disposition of the land on the hydrography of Europe is exhibited in the following table, in which the rivers are grouped together according to the basins to which they belong : \u2014"], [83, "Chap. I. HYDROGRAPHY. 67 \u00a7 12. Relative Importance of the Rivers. Danube : Rhine. \u2014 The above classification, useful as it is in a mere physical point of view, does not convey to the student much idea of the respective values, commercially and politically, of the several rivers. This depends on a variety of circumstances, but most of all on the character and relative position of the countries through which, they flow. We will group the rivers in another way in order to exhibit this point, adopting a four-fold division: \u2014 (1) The rivers of the great Sarmatian Plain. (2) The rivers of the peninsulas. (3) The rivers that rise on the flanks of the Alpine system. (4) The rivers that rise in the heart of the Alpine system. 1. The rivers of the Sarmatian Plain are the Volga, Dnieper, Don, Dniester, Neva, Diina, Bug (a branch of the Vistula), Niemen, Dwina, Mezen, and Petchora.

The Volga is thus connected by canals with Lakes Ladoga and Onega, and with the Dwina; and the Dnieper with the Diina, the Niemen, and the Vistula. These rivers flow through a thinly populated country, and terminate northwards in seas that are ice-locked in the winter months and remote from the great centres of commerce. They are rivers of national, but not of international, importance. 2. The rivers of the Iberian peninsula are large and, as compared with the area, numerous. The Ebro and Guadalquivir belong wholly to Spain ; the Tagus, Guadiana, Douro, and Minho, to Spain in then upper and middle courses, and to Portugal in their lower courses. These rivers are of slight commercial value even within the limits of the peninsula ; from deficiency of water they are navigable only in their lower courses, and, even if navigable, the nature of the country renders the junction of the streams by canals difficult ; their chief use is in the irrigation of the adjacent lands. The Po, with its various affluents, waters the fine plain of Lombardy between the Alps and the Apennines, affording an outlet in the direction of the Adriatic, with navigation as high as Cremona, and by its affluents conducting to the points at which the Alps are passable: the Po and its affluents figure largely in the military history of the continent. The Balkan peninsula possesses no river of im portance. 3. The rivers rising on the flanks of the Alpine system may be divided into two classes according as they rise on the eastern or on the western flank. To the former we may assign the rivers of the German Plain, viz. : the Vistula from the Western Carpathians ; the Oder from the N. side of the Sudetes and the Riesengebirge ; the Elbe, which receives the whole drainage of the Bohemian basin and supplies the only natural outlet for its products ; and the Weser, which is divided from the Elbe by the Hartz mountains. Each of these rivers is valuable to the commerce of the interior, as is testified by the importance of the towns, Danzig, Stettin, Hamburg, and Bremen, which form their respective emporia. The Elbe, however, has the advantage over the Vistula and Oder of an immediate outlet to the North Sea, and, being connected by canals with the other two, draws to itself the bulk of the foreign trade of North Germany. The rivers that rise on the western flank belong to Belgium and France \u2014 the Meuse to Belgium, the Seine, Loire, Saone, (a branch of the Rhone), and Garonne to France. These arc of considerable value, particularly as the configuration of France and Belgium admits of the rivers being connected by a network of canals\u2014 the Garonne with the Rhone and Sa6ne, the SaSne with the Loire, the Loire with the Seine, and the Seine with the Meuse. 4. The rivers"], [85, "Chap. I. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF RIVERS. 69 that rise in the heart of the Alpine district are thc Danube, Rhine and Rhone. The two first are of international and even continental importance, but the Rhone being navigable only within France cannot claim such a position, though if we view 'the Rhone and the Saone (which is the true representative of the Rhone above Lyons in every respect except volume of water) in connexion with the Rhine it will be found that the two form a communication between the Mediterranean and the North Sea, their basins being separated by so slight an interval, that a canal joins them between the Vosges and the Jura. Of the two first rivers a more detailed account is needed. Gates of the Danube. The Danube (Germ. Donau) stands first among European rivers in con tinental importance as well as in size. It is the great artery of commu nication between East and West, its main stream leading towards the Rhine and Central Europe, and its affluents, the Drave and Save, opening a way towards the Adriatic and the plains of Lombardy. It has its sources in the Black Forest, not at Donaueschingen, as is popu larly believed, but in the brooks of Brege aud Brigach (48\u00b0 6' N. lat., 8\u00b0 9' E. long.). Its Upper course may be regarded as extending to the confluence of the Inn ; its Middle course from the Inn to Orsova ; and its Lower course from Orsova to the Black Sea. In its Upper course it has a rapid descent from its sources (2850 ft. above the sea) to Ulm (1355 ft.), skirting closely the S. slope ofthe Rauhe Alp and re ceiving the Iller. At Ulm navigation commences for barges, and at Ratisbon (Regensburg) for steamers: between these points it presses closely on the S. slope of the Franconian Jura, is connected with the Main and so with the Rhine by the Ludwig's Canal, and receives the"], [86, "Book I. 70 EUROPE. Leek on its right, and the Regen on its left bank. At Ratisbon it turns from N.E. to S.E., and skirts the lower ridges of the Bohmer wald. At Passau it receives the Inn, which rises m the Rh\u00e6tian Alps, and equals, if it does not exceed, the Danube in importance. In its Middle course it first traverses a mountainous region between Passau and Vieuna, with the Bohemian Mountains on the left, and the northern extensions of the Alps on the right : thenceforward it enters on a series of plains divided from each other by protruding ranges, and receives a succession of important tributaries, the March and the Waag on ita left and the Raab on its right bank, between Vienna and Pesth, above which town it makes a southerly bend at right angles to its former course ; lower down, the twin streams of the Drave and Save on its right, and the Theiss on its left bank, all three joining it near the point where it resumes its easterly course ; and still lower, the Morava on its left bank. Near Orswa it bursts through the protruding ridges of the Carpathians and the northern limb of the Balkan by a gorge named the \" Iron Gate.\" Iu its Lower course it traverses the Wal lachian Plain; before joining the Black Sea it makes a double bend, northwards and eastwards, and in this part of its course receives two important tributaries, the Sereth and the Pruth, on its left bank : it discharges its waters through several channels, of which the Sulina is the most important. The Rhine (Germ. Rhein) stands next to the Danube in continental importance, as a highway of commuuication between Central and North-western Europe, and the object of many a military and political struggle. It rises on the E. slope of St. Gothard, and is designated in its earlier course the Vorder-Rhein, as distinguished from the Hinter- Rhein, which joins it above Coire. The Upper course of the Rhine may be considered as extending to Basle, where the river turns sharply north ward and becomes navigable : its Middle course extends thence to the Siebengebirge above Bonn ; and its Lower course thence to the sea. In its Upper course it takes a circuitous line N.E., N., N.W., and W., traversing the BodenSee (Lake of Constance), making a considerable fall at Schaffhausen, and receiving an important affluent, the Aar, which drains the greater part of Switzerland. In the upper part of its Middle course it traverses a broad valley, once to all appearance the bed of a lake : this valley or plain is divided into two parts, differing somewhat in character, viz., the upper plain, which extends down to the Neckar, the lower plain thence to the gorge at Bingen. In the former the Rhine receives no affluent of importance ; in the latter it receives on its right bank the Neckar and the Main, the latter being connected with the Danube by the Ludwig's Canal. In the lower part of its Middle course the Rhine bursts through the ranges that once hemmed in its waters, and descends rapidly with many windings, receiving a considerable tri butary, the Moselle, on its left bank, and a less important one, the Lahn, on its right bank. In its Lower course the Rhine receives the Lippe, and, reaching Holland, becomes entangled in the network of chaunels which intersect that country. The stream that retains the name of the Rhine terminates ingloriously in a canal near Leyden, and is discharged into the sea through sluice-gates, having previously parted with the bulk of its waters to the Waal, and with portions of the re mainder to the Yssel, the Leek, and the Vecht successively. \u00a7 13. Temperature. \u2014 With the exception of the extreme north ern districts of Russia and Scandinavia, the whole of Europe lies"], [87, "Chap. I. TEMPERATURE\u2014 MINERALS. 71 within the north Temperate Zone. It has already been observed (\u00a7 2) that the temperature is favourably affected by the presence of large bodies of water which render the climate to a great extent in sular. The N.W. coast is further favoured with the genial influence of the Gulf stream. Central Europe is but slightly affected by these causes : its elevation, however, tends to modify the beat, and its numerous mountain ranges screen it from the cold winds of the N. and E. The great eastern plain, still farther removed from the sea, and exposing a vast expanse of land, has a thoroughly continental climate with a wide range of temperature. The southern peninsulas of Italy and Greece, shielded from the N. by mountain ranges, and exposed to the occasional influence of the hot blasts of the Sahara, have a high, and sometimes an excessive, temperature. The same may be observed of the S. coasts of Spain and Portugal. There are thus five climatic zones or regions : \u2014 (1) The Arctic por tions of Sweden and Russia. (2) The British Isles, N.W. France, and Norway, which are affected by the presence not only of the Ocean, but also of the Gulf Stream. (3) The western portions of the con tinent \u2014 France, the Netherlands, Denmark, and N. Spain \u2014 which are affected by the Ocean. (4) The high and sheltered regions of Cen tral Europe, with a continental but not an extreme temperature. (5) The Great Plain, with its severe cold and comparatively severe heat. (6) The Southern Peninsulas (with the exception of the N. coast and the plateau of Spain), with a decidedly hot climate. With a view to illustrate, though imperfectly, the leading features above noticed, we append the following table, exhibiting the mean annual temperature and the difference between the winter and summer temperatures at certain spots : \u2014 \u00a7 14. Minerals. \u2014 Minerals are largely diffused over Europe, the commoner and more useful kinds in greater abundance than the merely ornamental. Of precious stones, diamonds are found in the Ural Mountains; opals in Hungary, and garnets in Bohemia, and the latter also in Spain ; beryls of inferior quality in Hungary and near Salzburg ; jasper, agate, and chalcedony at Oberstein in Birkenfeld.

Mountains ; it is found in less abundance in Transylvania, Hungary, Piedmont, the N.W. of Austria, and the bed of the Danube, and in still smaller quantities in Spain, Wales, and the Wicklow Moun tains in Ireland. The most important silver mines are in Hungary about Chemnitz, in the Bohemian Erzgebirge, and near Chris tiania in Sweden : silver is also found in Saxony, Transylvania, and Austria, and, in combination with lead, in the British Isles. Copper is found almost everywhere, but more especially in Sweden, Norway, Germany, and the British Isles. Lead is found largely in Spain and the British Isles, as well as in Saxony, Bohemia, and Carinthia, and, in smaller quantity, in France. Tin is scarce : England pro duces more than any other European country ; there are mines of it in Saxony, and Bohemia. Quicksilver is chiefly obtained from Almaden in Spain, and is also found in Austria (at Idria in Car niola), and in parts of Germany. Iron is extensively diffused over Europe, particularly in Great Britain, Sweden, Norway, Russia, Germany, Styria, Elba, Belgium, and France. Coal is widely dif fused ; but the largest produce is obtained from Great Britain, Bel gium, France, and Germany. Arsenic occurs in combination with iron. Salt is found in England, Austria, Bavaria, and Tuscany. Petroleum in Wallachia about the Carpathians, and in Wales. Amber on the S. shores of the Baltic. Sulphur in the volcanic districts of Italy and Sicily. Marble in the Apennines and else where. Platinum in the Ural Mountains. Alum in England, Italy, Russia, and Northern Germany. Boracic acid in Italy. \u00a7 15. Vegetation. \u2014 Four out of the eight zones of vegetation, noticed in the Introd., cap. 3, \u00a7 14, are represented in Europe, viz. : the Warm Temperate zone of evergreen trees, which is here confined to the southern peninsulas ; the Cold Temperate zone of deciduous trees, which embraces the central districts to the 58th parallel of K. lat. ; the Sub-arctic zone of pines, between the 58th parallel and the Arctic circle; and the Arctic zone of mosses, lichens, and saxifrages, N. of the Arctic circle. Due allowance must be made for the devia tions from normal temperature arising out of local circumstances (elevation, position in reference to water, mountain-ranges, &c.) in the application of the above general arrangement to Europe. The central coast of Norway, for instance, has the characteristics of the Cold Temperate zone, although its latitude would place it in the Sub-arctic : the oak, elm, and lime grow as high as 63\u00b0, wheat up to 62\u00b0, barley, rye, and oats up to 70\u00b0. In Russia wheat does not succeed beyond 58\u00b0, oats beyond 62\u00b0, and barley beyond 67\u00b0 N. lat. In Norway the limit of the oak is 63\u00b0, in E. Russia 57\u00b0. So, again, the Arctic flora is reproduced on the high Alps and on the mountains of Great Britain. The Cold Temperate zone would admit of a subdivi sion in about the 50th parallel, as marking the northern limit of the"], [89, "Ciup. I. ZOOLOGY\u2014 POPULATION. 73 maize and the vine. Among the special productions of the Warm Temperate zone may be noticed the olive, orange, lemon, date-palm, rice, and sugar-cane. Tobacco is largely grown in Central Europe, and millet in Central Russia. \u00a7 16. Zoology. \u2014 The Fauna of Europe is remarkable for the large proportion of domesticated as compared with wild animals. The bear is found in the Arctic regions and in the Pyrenees; the wolf and wild boar in most parts of the continent where forests or mountains afford shelter ; the urus or wild ox only in the forests of Lithuania ; the chamois and the ibex on the high Alps and Pyrenees ; the beaver in the large rivers of Central Europe ; the monkey on the rock of Gibraltar ; the porcupine only in the S. ; the fox, otter, badger, and squirrel very generally. The domesticated animals of the Temperate zone are too familiar to need enumeration : N. of 66\u00b0 N. lat. the reindeer takes the place of the horse and ox : the buffalo is domes ticated in the plains of Wallachia and Italy, and in parts of S. Russia ; and the camel is also occasionally seen between the Black and Caspian Seas. The mule is more important in the southern peninsulas than elsewhere. The silk-worm is extensively cultivated in Italy, the S. of France, and Spain, and in the latter country the cochineal has been introduced with success. A few birds call for special notice : the eider-duck of the Norwegian coasts and northern islands is valuable for its down : the stork may be almost said to be domesticated in Holland during the period of its sojourn in high latitudes : the falcon is still occasionally trained for sporting pur poses : the pheasant, peacock, turkey, and many species of fowls are importations from other continents. Songsters are more numerous in Europe than in any other part of the world. Of marine produc tions we may notice the red coral and sponges of the Mediterranean ; the tunny fish of the same sea ; the seals and whales of the Arctic sea ; the sturgeon of the Caspian, whence caviare is obtained ; and the herring, mackerel, cod, and pilchard of the North Atlantic : ah of which are of great commercial value to the countries bordering on these seas. \u00a7 17. Population. \u2014 The population of Europe is computed to amount to about 285 millions. Referring to the divisions of the human race (Introd. cap. 3, \u00a7 18), the great bulk of it belongs to the Caucasian group, and the remainder to the Mongolian, which includes the Turks, Finns, Magyars, Lapps, Samoyiedes, Esthonians, and Livonians. Of the Caucasians, the two great linguistic divisions (Introd. cap. 3, \u00a7 19) are represented ; the Shemitic by the Jews, the Indo-European by the remaining population, the Mongolians ex cepted. The Indian subdivision of the Indo-European family is represented only by the Gypsies : the European by the living languages belonging to the races which successively emigrated MOD. geo. e"], [90, "Book I. 74 EUROPE. westward, and which at present occupy the areas described in the subjoined table. It must not, however, be supposed that the area of language is identical with the area of race. In France, for instance, the basis of the population may be Celtic, but the language belongs to the Gr\u00e6co-Italian division: in Greece the language is almost identical with the old Hellenic tongue, but it is uncertain how far the old Hellenic blood flows in the veins of the modern Greek. The Celts of Scotland and Ireland are fast adopting the Enghsh language, and in Cornwall the old Celtic tongue has wholly died out. The present relative importance of the divisions will appear from the following table in which the population and area of each are given : \u2014 The Mongolians fall into two divisions : \u2014 (1) The Finnish, to which belong the Finns witb the other northern tribes already enumerated, and the Magyars of Hungary. (2) The Tartar, of which the Turks are the chief representatives, the Kalmucks and other nomad tribes of the steppes also belonging to it. The Finnish branch is estimated at 12,000,000, and the Tartar at from five to six millions, the Osmanlis being, however, only one million out of this number. One nation, the Basque of northern Spain, has not yet had its place assigned in the ethnology of Europe: its language resembles the Finnish in structure. Another nation, the Skipetares of Albania, is also in a doubtful position. The Jews are estimated at two millions, and the Gypsies at about half a million. \u00a7 18. Political Divisions. \u2014 The sovereign powers of Europe are commonly arranged in certain classes, the first consisting of the Five \" Great Powers,\" viz. : Great Britain, France, Russia, Prussia, and Austria ; the second, of Spain, Italy, Belgium, Sweden and Norway, Divisions.

A complete enumeration of the political divisions would further comprise the Papal States and the minor German sovereign ties, viz. : \u2014 the kingdoms of Bavaria, Saxony, and Wiirtemberg, the Grand-Duchies of Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, Saxe-Weimar, the two Mecklenburgs (Schwerin and Strelitz), and Oldenburg, the Duchies of Brunswick, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe- Gotha, and Anhalt, together with 8 Principalities, and the 3 free cities of Lubeck, Bremen, and Hamburg. Even the petty states of Monaco in N. Italy, San Marino in the Apennines, and Andorre in the Pyrenees, might be added to the list. The political status of the minor German States has been much modified by the results of the war of 1866. Prussia exercises a supremacy over the States N. of the Main, which are combined in a new Confederation. The southern States, Bavaria, Wiirtemberg, Hesse-Darmstadt (S. of the Main) and Baden are at liberty to form a separate Confederation in conjunction with Austria. The position of some of the Turkish provinces is peculiar, the Danubian Principalities, Servia, and Montenegro being independent of the sovereign state in all matters of internal administration. We shall describe the political divisions under ihe following heads : \u2014 (1) The British Isles. (2) Spain. (3) Portugal. (4) France. (5) Switzerland. (6) Belgium. (7) The Netherlands.

British Isles, Position, &o. \u2014 The British Isles are a large group off the W. coast of Europe, consisting of the following constituent parts: \u2014 (1) Two islands of superior size, Great Britain and Ireland, the former divided into two great portions by a line crossing diagonally from the Solway Firth to the mouth of the Tweed, the southern division comprising England and Wales, and the northern Scotland. (2) Several islands of lesser, but still con siderable size, closely adjacent to Great Britain, the Isles of Wight and Anglesea belonging to the southern division ; Arran, Bute, Mull, and Skye, to the northern division. (3) The Isle of Man, midway between Great Britain and Ireland. (4) Several groups or clusters of islands, at varying distances from Great Britain \u2014 the Scilly Isles off the coast of Cornwall ; the outer Hebrides, Orkneys, and Shetlands off the coast of North Britain. (5) A vast number of islets and rocks of insignificant size, chiefly about the coasts of Ireland. The total number of the islands, great and small, is com puted to be 5500, of which 5000 belong to Ireland. As many as 420 are more or less inhabited, 175 attached to Great Britain, and the remainder to Ireland. The Channel Islands are a group off the coast of Normandy, belonging geographically to France but politically to Great Britain. The British Isles stretch through nearly eleven degrees of latitude from the Lizard in 49\u00b0 58' to Unst in 60\u00b0 49', and through twelve degrees of longitude from Lowestoft Ness in 1\u00b0 45' E. to the Blasquet Isles in 10\u00b0 35' W. If the Channel Isles be taken into account, the S. limit would lie in 49\u00b0 9' N. lat. The total area of the British Isles (the Channel Isles included) is estimated at 122,550 sq. m., and their population (in 1861) at 29,070,932, giving an average of 237 persons to a sq. m. Influence of position. \u2014 The British Isles owe much to their position. Situated on the verge of Western Europe, they enjoy the advantages without the disadvantages of a continental state \u2014 their proximity en titling them to a voice in the affairs of the continent, while their com plete separation from it frees them from frontier disputes, and renders invasion a difficult task. On one side Great Britain faces the most densely populated and best ordered countries of the Old World : on the other side, the most active and enlightened regions of the New World. And if Europe reaps any advantage from being centrally situated in reference to the terrestrial hemisphere, Great Britain must profit in a higher degree, inasmuch as the highways of the ocean enable her the more readily to avail herself of the advantage. The length of her sea board, and the semi-inclosed seas which surround her, are calculated to foster maritime enterprise, whether for the peaceful prosecution of com merce or for naval warfare. Names of the British Isles and their inhabitants.\u2014 The origin of the"], [94, "Book I. 78 THE BRITISH ISLES. name Britain is unknown. The name England evidently means \"the land of the Angli,\" a Teutonic tribe who settled in the eastern counties. The extension of the name to the whole nation was probably due to the Roman missionaries who had casually heard of that tribe first, and re garded it as the name of the country at large. The term Anglo-Saxon, sometimes understood to mean \" Angles and Saxons,\" is more probably intended to distinguish the Saxons of England from the Saxons of conti nental Europe. The names Wales and Welsh are of Teutonic origin, and were assigned by the Saxons to the old British to signify that they were aliens: the same root appears in TFaH-achia, Wall-oon, VcH-ms, and in Walsch-\\a,nd, the German name for Italy. The indigenous name of the Welsh is Cymry, which appears in the forms \" Cambria\" and \" Om&er-land.\" The name Scotland comes from the Irish Scoti, who established themselves on the W. coast early in the 6th cent. Scotia was at that period, and down to the 10th cent., the name of Ireland. In Scotland it extended itself with the increasing influence of the Scots, and finally superseded that of \" Pict.\" The essential part of the name Ireland is the first syllable \"ire,\" which appears in all the names ancient and modern of the island and people, e. g. Erin, Erse, I-era-e, Hib-em-ia, and Juv-erre-a. It origin is unknown : it has been referred to the ethnic name \" Aryan,\" as being occupied by an ancient branch of that race. Historical Geography. \u2014 We shall confine ourselves to a brief sketch of the events that led to the gradual consolidation of the British Isles into a single state. After the withdrawal of the Romans from Britain the German tribes came over in greater force than previously, and established themselves not only on the coasts, but in the interior. The dates and destinations of the successive immigrations are as follows : \u2014 in 450 the Jutes in Kent ; 477 the Saxons in Sussex ; 495 the Saxons in Hampshire, which became tbe nucleus of the future kingdom of Wessex ; 527 the Saxons in Essex and Middlesex ; 547 the Angles in Lodonia (the Lo thians, S. of the Firth of Forth ) and Northumbria, which included the provinces of Bernieia (the British Bryneich) between the Tyne and the Firth of Forth, and Deira (the British Deifr) between the Tyne and the Humber. In 626 the Angles pushed westward to the Severn, and established the independent state of Mercia in the central districts of England. Meanwhile the British maintained their independence in Wales, in Devon and Cornwall (the British Dyvnant and Cernan), and in the district between the Mersey and the Clyde (Cumbria or Strath clyde). N. of the Firths of Forth and Clyde, the Picts occupied the eastern coast in two divisions, North and South Picts, while the Scots, who entered from Ireland in the 6th century, founded the kingdom of Dalriada in Argyllshire, and gradually became dominant in the western region. The Danes began their incursions into England about 787, and this led to the consolidation of the Anglo-Saxon states under Egbert, king of Wessex, in 827. The Danes established themselves in the Danelagh or ' Danish State,' between the Tweed and the Thames. Under the Anglo-Norman kings, England became a united and powerful kingdom, and the conquest of Wales, in 1283, brought the whole of South Britain under one crown. The Channel Islands are the sole relic of the extensive continental domain once attached to the English crown, and which in Henry II.'s reign extended from the English Channel to the Pyrenees. Turning to Scotland we have to notice, as the first great step to consolidation, the union of the Picts and Scots under the sway of Kenneth Macalpin, king of the Scots, in 843."], [95, "Chap. II. SEAS. 79 Lodonia was united to the Scottish crown in 971 ; Strathclyde in 973; and Galloway at a later but an undefined date. The Norsemen effected settlements on the N. coast and the adjacent islands in the 9th century under Harold Harfager. In 1085 the greater part of these were conquered by Malcolm Canmore, and were nominally annexed to the Scottish crown. In 1266 the Hebrides were ceded by the Norwegians, and in 1 468 the Shetlands were pledged to James III. as security for the dowry of his wife, Margaret of Denmark. By the accession of James VI. of Scotland to the throne .of England in 1603, the two countries came under a single ruler: in 1707 the legislatures were com bined, and Scotland was finally united to England. In Henry II.'s reign Ireland was parcelled out into various petty sovereignties, among which those of Ulster, Meath, Leinster, Munster, and Connaught were predominant. These were easily subdued by the English, and in 1172 Ireland was annexed to the British crown. The union of the Parlia ments of England and Ireland was not effected until 1801. \u00a7 2. Seas. \u2014 The seas that wash the coasts of the British Isles are: \u2014 the Atlantic on the W. and N., the North Sea on the E., and the English Channel, with the Strait of Dover, on the S. The channels between Great Britain and Ireland, viz. : \u2014 St. George's Channel, the Irish Sea, and the North Channel, belong to the Atlantic. The North Sea owes its configuration to the gradual divergence of the E. coast of Great Britain from the W. coast of Europe : this divergence commences at the Strait of Dover, which has a breadth of only 20 m., and attains its maximum between Scotland and Denmark in about 57\u00b0 N. lat., beyond which it is again contracted by the westerly protrusion of the Scandinavian peninsula. The English Channel undergoes a similar though not an equal expansion westward from the Strait of Dover, attaining a maximum width of 155 m. in the neighbourhood of the Channel Islands, and contract ing to 102 m. off Land's End. St. George's Channel lies between Wales and Ireland, its limits being marked by St. David's Head in the S. and Holyhead in the N. ; its breadth varies from 40 to 70 m. The Irish Sea lies N. of St. George's Channel, and expands to a maximum breadth of 140 m. The North Channel separates the N.E. coast of Ireland from the S.W. coast of Scotland, and is narrowed to a breadth of only 13 m. between the Mull of Cantire and Fairhead. The open Atlantic stretches away from the W. coast of Ireland to America. Depth of Seas. \u2014 The North Sea is the shallowest of the seas about the British Isles, its average depth being only about 180 ft. Midway between England and Denmark there is an extensive submarine plateau, called the Dogger Bank, over which the depth of water varies from 60 to 120 ft. : this bank affords valuable fishing grounds. Off the E. coast of Kent lie the Goodwin Sands, 10 m. long by 1 J m. broad, very dan gerous to shipping. A not improbable tradition represents these sands as having formed part of the territory of Earl Godwin, the father of Harold. Between the Goodwin Sands and the coast of Kent is the roadstead known as the Downs. The English Channel attains its mi-"], [96, "Book I. 80 THE BRITISH ISLES. nimum depth (100ft.) between Dungeness and Boulogne: between Dover and Calais its depth is 150 ft., and westward of Dungeness it gradually deepens to about 250 ft. off Land's End. The Irish Sea is throughout free from shoals : the large bay E. of the Isles of Man and Anglesey is shallow (from 90 to 150 ft.) as compared with the channel between these islands and Ireland, the depth of which ranges from 300 to 400 ft. Tides. The tidal wave, generated in the Southern Ocean (as de scribed in the Introd. cap. 2, \u00a7 4) first touches the British Isles at the Land's End and the S.W. of Ireland, at which points the movement is communicated to the waters of the English Channel and the Irish Sea. The depressing effeets of narrow channels and shallow waters upon it are such that the North Sea is but slightly affected by the impetus communicated through the Strait of Dover, and even so far S. as the Thames the tidal movement is received not by this route but by the more open route round the head of the Orkneys. The time occupied by the wave in its passage from the W. coast of Ireland to London, is estimated at about 18 hours, while the branch which follows the Enghsh Channel occupies about 7 hours in reaching the same point. The effect ofthe tide in the estuaries is very marked: the waters, compressed by the in creasing narrowness of the channels, attain in places an extraordinary height. The height of the Wye at Chepstow has been already noticed aa attaining to 70 ft. : at London Bridge the spring-tide rises 18 ft., at Hull 22 ft., at Milford Haven 28 ft., and at the mouth of the Bristol Avon 48 ft. \u00a7 3. Climate. \u2014 The climate of the British Isles is oceanic in its general character, being mild, moist, and equable. The mean tem perature of the whole group is about 49\u00b0, and the difference between the means of summer and winter amounts only to 20\u00b0, the former being placed at 60\u00b0-02, the latter at 39\u00b0'42. The mean annual difference in temperature, resulting from the difference of latitude, amounts to about 7\u00b0 between Cornwall and the Shetlands. The difference dependent on longitude is very marked, the west coast from its exposure to the genial influence of the Atlantic being warmer in winter and cooler in summer than the east coast, which from its proximity to Europe has a climate of a more continental character. Thus the N.W. coast of Ireland has about the same mean annual temperature (50\u00b0) as the S.E. coast of England ; but the mean winter temperature in Ireland (41\u00b0) is experienced only in Cornwall and Devonshire, while its mean summer heat (61\u00b0) is experienced at a much higher latitude on the E. coast of England. Within the limits of England alone there appears to be an average difference of 4\u00b0 in the winter temperature of the E. and W. coasts ; but on the S. coast the difference amounts to about 7\u00b0, that of London being 37\u00b0-3, and of Penzance 44\u00b0-2. The rainfall also diminishes from W. to E. : in Ireland, the average on the W. coast is 47 inches, and on the E. 29 : in England, Cumberland exhibits the maximum fall in the British Isles (amounting at Seathwaite to 173 inches), while iu London the average fall is below 22 inches."], [97, "Chap. II. CLIMATE\u2014 MINERALS\u2014 VEGETATION. 81 The mean fall over the whole kingdom is estimated at about 34 inches. Both the temperature and the rainfall are affected by the direction of the wind : west winds, warm and moist, prevail over the dry and cold east winds in the ratio of 3 to 2 in the course of the year : due north and south winds are comparatively infrequent. The subjoined table exhibits the leading facts relating to the climate at stations selected from the E. and W. coasts of England, Scotland, and Ireland : \u2014 \u00a7 4. Minerals \u2014 Coal. \u2014 The mineral wealth of the British Isles is the foundation of their manufacturing and commercial prosperity. The distribution of the minerals is so unequal, and so far affects the condition of the different districts in which they occur, that a de scription of them will be reserved for the separate heads of England, Scotland, and Ireland. There is one mineral, however, which is found more or less in all three countries, and which, from its national importance, deserves a general, as well as a special notice, viz., coal. The amount of coal in Ireland is so small as to be hardly worthy of notice, except in so far as the circumstance precludes the possibility of that island ever becoming a manufacturing district. In Scotland and England the supplies are large, but not inexhaustible. It is estimated that we have a deposit of about 80,000 millions of tons, within a depth of 4000 ft. In 1865 the amount of coal raised was about 98 millions of tons, to which we may add, perhaps, as much as 20 millions of tons for waste in small coal, &c. Assuming that the produce was confined to this amount, the supply might last for some 800 years, but the produce has of late increased so rapidly, from 66J millions of tons in 1856, to 80 millions in 1860, and 98 millions in 1865, that a similar rate of increase will exhaust our supphes within the period of a long life. Of the total amount, about one-seventh is raised in Scotland, and the remainder in England and Wales. A large amount (from 9 to 10 millions of tons) is exported to foreign countries. \u00a7 5. Vegetation. \u2014 In regard to vegetation the British Isles bear a close resemblance to the adjacent parts of the continent. The bulk of the indigenous plants are found in Germany. Certain districts, however, exhibit features that do not belong to the Teutonic class. e 3 London . . . . Penzance . . . Edinburgh . . . Glasgow .... Dublin . . . .

The high summits of the mountains have plants in common with the Scandinavian regions; Cornwall and the S.E. of Ireland in common with the peninsula of Brittany ; the S.W. of Ireland in com mon with the N. of Spain ; and the Chalk districts of the S. coast of England in common with the opposite coast of France. Thus the flora divides itself into five regions, which have been designated the Teutonic, the Scandinavian, the Armorican, the Andalusian or Asturian, and the Gallican. In the Scandinavian class we may notice particularly the potent ilia tridendata, a native of Arctic Ame rica, but in these islands restricted to a hill in Forfarshire in Scot land. The Andalusian class comprises the saxifrage or London pride, certain heaths (erica Mackayana, E. Mediterranea, and E. Ddb\u00e6cia), the arbutus unedo, the trichomanes radicans (found also in Madeira, the W. Indies, and N. Africa), a species of orchis (the spiranthes gemmifera), and the menziesia polyplia, or St. Dabeoc's heath. A peculiar plant, the eriocaulon septangulare, found in the Hebrides and on the W. coast of Ireland, has been probaVy brought thither by the Gulf Stream. A water-plant, the anacharsis alsinastrum, which has appeared in the midland districts of England, is supposed to have been introduced in Canadian timber. Naturalized Exotics. \u2014 The majority of the cultivated and ornamental plants of the British Isles are exotics which have been introduced at various periods. The ordinary cereals, for instance, wheat, barley, and rye, are natives of Asia -, the first, and probably the other two were in troduced by the Romans. In some instances the exact dates of the importation are known : the potato was brought from Virginia by Sir W. Raleigh in 158b ; the vine from Portugal in 1552 ; the pine-apple from Brazil in the reign of Charles II. ; hops from Flanders in 1524 ; flax in 1533; parsley in 1548 ; the deodara from the Himalayas, the araucaria from the Andes, and the Wellingtonia from the Sierra Nevada of Cali fornia, within the memory of the present generation. In other cases the names bespeak the foreign origin, as in the case of the wall-nut (the German Walsche Nuss, or Italian nut) ; the Jerusalem (a corrup tion of the Italian girasole, 'sun-flower') artichoke; the Lombardy poplar ; the mangold-wurzel of the Germans ; the cherry (from Cerams in Asia Minor), probably introduced by the Romans ; the cedar of Le banon, from Syria ; the chestnut (from Castanea in Greece) ; the Turkey oak ; and many others. The spruce-fir came to us from Norway ; the common larch from Russia, and the red larch from North America. Peas, beans, lettuce, and in short all edible vegetables, except the cabbage, celery, parsnip, and carrot, are exotics. \u00a7 6. Zoology. \u2014 The zoology of the British Isles is more a matter of interest to the naturalist than of importance to the geographer. Wild animals of any size or ferocity have all but disappeared, some of them within historical memory. The bear subsisted in Scotland down to 1057, and the wolf in the same country until 1680, but in England (in consequence of the severe measures taken for its extir pation, such as the tribute of 300 wolves' heads exacted from the"], [99, "Chap. II. ZOOLOGY. 83 Welsh by King Edgar) not later than Edward I.'s reign. The wild boar had become scarce in Charles I.'s reign, and the beaver is not noticed after the 12th century. The existence of these animals is attested by the names of places, such as Penarth in Glamorganshire, ' bear's head ;' Nant Francon, near Bangor, ' beaver's brook,' and Llyn-yr-afange, ' beaver's lake ;' Beverley in Yorkshire, and Bevere near Worcester, which also refer to the beaver ; as Eversley and Evershot (from the Saxon eqfer) do to the wild boar. Certain species of oxen were common in early times : the bos primigenius, though unmentioned in history, appears to have been coeval with man; the bos longifrons was domesticated in the time of the Bomans ; and the wild ox, urus silvestris, was in existence in Henry II.'s reign. A breed of wild cattle of a white colour is preserved in some few parks (Chillingham in Northumberland, Chartley in Staffordshire, Lime Hall in Cheshire, and Chatelherault in Lanarkshire), but it appears doubtful whether these represent au aboriginal British race. The gigantic elk of Ireland, now found only in a fossil state, appears to have been coeval with man in the pre-historic age. Of the existing wild animals the red deer and the fox are preserved for sporting purposes, the former chiefly in Scotland ; the fallow deer is common in our parks. The otter, badger, polecat, and weasel, are indigenous in Britain, but not in Ireland \u2014 an observation which also applies to the toad, mole, squirrel, and dormouse. Of birds we have to notice : \u2014 the nightingale, which is found in England alone of the British Isles, and even here not farther N. than Doncaster ; the red grouse, a bird peculiar to these islands, and ot great value in Scotland for sporting purposes ; the capercailzie, formerly abundant in Scotland, then extirpated, and now to a certain extent re-introduced ; and the swan, once much prized as an article of food, but now preserved for ornament on the Thames and about mansions, the only swannery on a large scale being that at Abbotsbury in Dorset. The fisheries are valuable : seals, and occasionally whales of a small size visit the coasts of Scotland : the herring is caught on various parts of the coast, but of espe cially fine quality off Yarmouth and in Loch Fyne ; cod off the coast of Yorkshire ; turbot off the coasts of Suffolk and the Isle of Wight ; oysters off the coasts of Essex and Hants ; and pilchards off Cornwall and Devon. The salmon is the most valuable of the river fish, and efforts are now being made to restock our rivers with it. Three kinds of serpents are found in the British Isles, of which the viper alone is venomous, and this is not met with in Ireland. With regard to the domesticated animals little need be said : the majority of them have existed here from time immemorial, and it is diffi cult to say whether they are indigenous or imported. Various kinds of poultry are importations, the turkey from North America in 1524,"], [100, "Book I. THE BRITISH ISLES. 84 the guineafowl from Africa, the peacock from India, and the domestic fowl from eastern Asia. The eland has been lately introduced with a view to supply an additional kind of meat. \u00a7 7. Ethnology. \u2014 The population of the British Isles belongs almost wholly to two of the great branches of the Indo-European stock viz. : \u2014 the Celtic in both its subdivisions, the Erse and the Cymry, and the Teutonic in three of its subdivisons, the German, the Dane, and the Norwegian. The Bomans during their long tenure of South Britain may have contributed some other elements to the population, but not to such an extent as to effect its general character. The Celts were dominant previous to the Boman con quest, and constituted, as far as we know, the aboriginal population, the Erse in Ireland and the Cymry in the greater part of Britain, it being doubtful to which of the two branches we should assign the original population of the North of Scotland. The Saxons com menced their settlements on the E. coasts of England at least two centuries before the received date of Hengist and Horsa. By degrees the Teutonic tribes established their supremacy over the whole of Britain S. of the Firths of Forth and Clyde, with the ex ception of the western districts, Cornwall, Wales, and Strathclyde, which were retained by the Cymry. Whether the Cymry were elsewhere absorbed into the Teutonic population, or whether they were wholly extirpated from those parts of the island, is uncertain. The bulk of the Teutonic population consisted of Saxons (including under that title the Jutes and Angles as well as the Saxons proper) : but in addition to these there was a large influx of Danes and Norwegians. The districts occupied by these nationalities can be ascertained from existing names, as each nation used distinctive affixes. A list of these is given below, and by the application of these as tests it will be found that the Danes occupied the district between the Tees in the N. and Watling Street in the S., without, however, advancing E. of the Wash except in a small district between the rivers Bure and Yare in Norfolk ; and that the Norwegians settled in the N.W. of England (Cumberland, Westmoreland, Lancashire, and that part of Cheshire which lies between the Mersey and the Dee), in Dumfriesshire and about the N. and N.W. coasts of Scotland (Caithness, Sutherland = the southern land in reference to Norway, the Hebrides, and Isle of Man, which they designated the Sudoreyer or southern islands), and that they frequented the coasts of England and Wales, and probably settled on the E. and S.E. of Ireland (Wexford, Waterford, Wicklow, Lambay, Ireland's Eye, Dalkey). We may notice, lastly, the colony of Flemings introduced by Henry I. into Pembrokeshire, and the subsequent immigrations of the same industrious people in small bodies. Teutonic Name-terminations.\u2014 The terminations indicative of Anglo-"], [101, "Chap. II. ETHNOLOGY. 85 Saxon settlements are ton, ' enclosure;' stoke, a ' stockaded ' place ; worth, a ' warded ' or defended place ; ham, a ' home ;' bury or borough, from a word signifying 'to conceal ;' and ing, a patronymic form. The Danish settlements are indicated by the terminations by, ' dwelling;' thorp or throp, 'village;' kirk, 'church;' and caster as the equivalent of the Roman castra, which the Anglo-Saxons converted into Chester. The Norwegian settlements, by the terminations thwaite, ' cleared ground;' well 'abode;' fell, 'mountain;' force, 'waterfall;' dale, 'valley;' and tarn, ' pool .' The coasts also bear testimony to the occasional visits of the Norwegians in the terminations ness or naze, ' promontory ;' holm, 'island;' icich or voe, 'bay ;' and ford, 'fiord ' or 'inlet.' Government. \u2014 The form of government established in these realms is a limited monarchy, the supreme authority being vested jointly in the three estates, King, Lords, and Commons. The joint action of these three is effected through the two Houses of Parliament, which are summoned by the King, and must have their acts ratified by him. The House of Lords consists ofthe following elements : \u2014 (1) The Tem poral Peers of England, the number varying with the extinction or creation of titles, and occasionally through the title being held by a minor, who is disqualified, as such, from taking his seat. (2) The Elected Peers of Scotland and Ireland, the number being limited to 16 for Scotland, who are appointed only for the duration of the Parlia ment, and to 28 for Ireland, who are appointed for life. (3) The Spiritual Peers, 27 for England and Wales, including the two arch bishops and 25 bishops ; and four for Ireland who are elected for each session. The House of Lords numbered 434 members in 1865. The House of Commons consists of 658 elected members, 500 for England, 53 for Scotland, and 105 for Ireland. Of these 658, 256 represent counties ; the remaining 402 cities and boroughs. The executive power belongs theoretically to the Sovereign, but practically to the Parlia ment, inasmuch as the Ministers who are the Sovereign's agents are held in check by the Parliament. The Sovereign is aided by a Privy Council, consisting of an undefined number of the most eminent men in the State : this Council is the highest Court of Appeal, and acts in this respect through a Judicial Committee appointed for that express purpose. Religion. \u2014 All forms of religion are tolerated in these realms, but in each of the great divisions there is an \" established \" form, i. e. one that is recognised by the State, and is supported by the ancient endowments of the Church. In England and Ireland the Protestant Episcopal, or what is usually termed, the ' Anglican ' Church, is so established : in Scotland, the Presbyterian Church, the distinctive feature of which is the absence of the Episcopacy. In each case there are powerful religious communities outside the pale of the establishment : in regard to Scotland and Ireland statistical statements will be given in reference to these, but for England no authoritative statements on this subject are at hand. The English Church has its representative bodies in two houses of Con vocation for each province, which are summoned by Royal Mandate as the Houses of Parliament are : but the legislative functions of Con vocation have been in abeyance for the last century and a half. Education. \u2014 Education is carried on by a mixed system of public and private expenditure, over which the State exercises a general, and, in the case of the poor, a special supervision. In England grants are made from the state funds to primary schools in aid of contributions obtained through private exertions, and the religious teaching in such schools ia"], [102, "Book I. 86 THE BRITISH ISLES. mainly left to the discretion of the local managers. In Ireland grants are made only to schools where neutrality is observed m reference to religious teaching, and such grants are administered by a Board com posed of persons of various religious tenets. In Scotland the primary schools are under the management of the established Church, and are supported by a rate on the landed property in each parish. The higher education is carried on in England and Scotland by the aid of ancient endowments alone ; in Ireland parliamentary grants are made to May nooth and the Queen's Colleges. Both Scotland and Ireland possess their own universities ; but so many students from these parts fre quent the English universities and public schools that these may be regarded as belonging to the British Isles generally with the exception of the University of Durham, which was designed to supply a local requirement. Setting this aside, we have to notice the three Univer sities of Oxford, Cambridge, and London. The last differs from the Sa Oxford \u2014 Merton CoUege. St. Mary's Church aud the BaddiHe Library in the background. others in that it possesses no educational establishments under its own care. Its function is confined to examinations and granting degrees; and this function it exercises in reference to any colleges that affiliate themselves to it, such as King's and University Colleges, London, and others. Oxford has been a seat of learning from the time of Edward the Confessor: University, which claims to be the oldest existing college, was restored (if not founded) by William of Durham, who died in 1249; there are now 19 colleges and 5 halls, founded at various periods. Cambridge probably owes its origin as a University to Sigebert, king of the East Angles, in the 7th century ; the oldest existing college, St. Peter's, was founded in 1257, and there are now 17 colleges and halls. London University was founded in 1836. The great public schools, with the dates of their foundations, are \u2014 Eton (1440), Winchester (1387), Harrow (1590), Rugby (1567), Westminster (1560), Charterhouse (1611), and Shrewsbury (1562). London also possesses the ancient schools of St. Paul's (1512), Merchant Taylors' (1561), and"], [103, "Chap. II. THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. 87 Christ's Hospital (1553). Of the modern foundations in this depart ment we may notice Marlborough (1843), Cheltenham (1841), Rossall (1844\\ and Wellington College (1859), as the most important. Manufactures and Commerce. \u2014 The manufactures and commerce of the British Isles are so mutually dependent on each other that in this general survey we shall regard them in conjunction, leaving the geo graphical distribution of the manufactures to be considered in detail hereafter. The manufactures may be classed under the two heads of (1) articles, of which we possess the raw material ; (2 ) articles, of which the raw material is supplied to us from abroad. In the former class iron stands foremost, supplying one of the most important branches of home and foreign trade in the forms of machinery, hardware, cutlery, hoops, railway plant, &c. Pottery may be noticed under the same head, and, to a certain extent, linen, a considerable amount of flax being grown in Ireland. In respect to these, commerce is engaged in the export of the manufactured article ; iron in its various forms is sent off to the value of 13 millions sterling. In the second class maybe placed the various textures of cotton, wool, and silk, together with the subor dinate but still important articles produced from hemp, leather, orna mental woods, &e. The three first articles supply commerce with the double task of bringing in the raw material and taking out the manu factured goods. Cotton stands foremost by far in both respects, the joint value of the imports and exports connected with it amounting in 1864 to about 133 millions sterling. Next stands the woollen and worsted business, the raw material for which exceeds in value 15 millions sterling, and the exported articles in the forms of cloth, flannel, worsted, and carpets, 18 millions sterling. Linen is exported to the value of above 8 millions, and haberdashery and millinery to near 5 millions sterling. Tbe Commerce of this country is not restricted to the branches above specified. In addition to (1) the import of raw material, and (2) the export of manufactured goods, we may notice (3) the export of raw material in respect to coal, and (4) the import of food, chiefly breadstuffs and tea, but embracing a vast number of articles of luxury, such as fruit, wine, spirits, spices, coffee, rice, sago, &c, to which we may add tobacco. The aggregate value of our foreign commerce (exports and imports) does not fall much short of 500 millions sterling. An enumeration of the places with which it is carried on would comprise the names of almost every known country. It will be sufficient to observe that about one-third of our external commerce (imports and exports) is carried on with our Colonial possessions, and the rest chiefly with the United States, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Turkey, Egypt, Brazil, Italy, China, &c. Looking at the articles imported from these various quarters, India sends us cotton, silk, sugar, rice, jute, indigo, an increasing amount of tea, spices, and fine woods: Australia, wool: Canada, timber : the West Indies, sugar, tobacco, rice, coffee, and rum: the United States, cotton, breadstuffs, and tobacco : France, wine, dried fruits, millinery, and articles of luxury: the Netherlands, dairy produce and live-stock : Germany, grain, rags (for paper), wool, and live-stock : Russia, hemp, flax, hides, wheat, and tallow : Spain and Portugal, wines, and dried fruits: Brazil, cotton, and sugar: Italy, silk and fine oil : China, tea and silk, &c, &c. \u00a7 8. The Channel Islands, &c. \u2014 The majority of the islands in the British seas are regarded politically as constituent parts of the adjacent mainlands, and are either attached to counties or themselves"], [104, "THE BRITISH ISLES. Book I. 88 form counties. Thus, for instance, the Isle of Wight forms part of Hampshire, and the Isle of Anglesea is one of the counties of Wales. All such islands will be hereafter described in connexion with their respective counties. There are a few islands, however, which are not so politically incorporated, but retain their distinctive systems of government, judicature, and taxation, subject to the authority ofthe Sovereign. The Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, and the Scilly Isles fall under this description, and thus require a separate notice. The Channel Islands lie off the coast of France, but have been attached to the British crown since the days of the Conqueror. They consist of 4 islands of appreciable size, and some adjacent islets, as follow : \u2014 Of the other islands Herm, near Guernsey, has a population of 38 and Jethou of 3. Jersey is 15 m. distant from France and 88 from the Bill of Portland ; it is undulating and picturesque, enjoys a very mild climate, and produces fruit and vegetables abundantly. St. Helier stands on the S. coast, where is the only considerable bay, and is much frequented as a residential town. Guernsey is 17 m. N.W. of Jersey, has a less varied surface, with a general inclination from S. to N., is also very productive of fruit and vegetables, yields in addition wheat and barley, and supports an excellent breed of milking-cows, superior even to that of Alderney. Its capital, St. Peter, stands on the E. coast. Alderney (Fr. Aurigny) is chiefly famous for its breed of cows : near it is the group of rocks called the Caskets, on which Prince William, tho son of Henry I., was lost in 1119: a lighthouse now marks their posi tion. The French language (a patois) prevails among the natives of the Channel Islands : the two larger islands have their own parliaments, under the superintendence of a governor appointed by the crown. Jersey also has its own court of judicature, the only appeal from which is to the sovereign in council. The islands are strongly fortified. Trade flourishes, and Guernsey has establishments for the manufacture or manipulation of wines. Communication is maintained with South ampton and Weymouth, the latter being the nearest English port. The Isle of Man lies about midway between England and Ireland, 28 m. from the former, 32 from the latter, and 16 from the nearest point of Scotland. It has a length of 33 m. from N.E. to S.W., an area of 190,000 acres, and a population of 52,469. A mountain range traverses it from Manghold Head on the E. coast to the S. extremity, culminating in Snaefell (2004 ft.). The N. point is called the Point ot Ayr, and off the S.W. point is a small island, the Calf of Man, sur mounted by a lighthouse. The island consists mainly of clayslate of various qualities, and yields a considerable amount of lead. The soil is fairly fertile, and marl is abundant. A peculiar breed of sheep, known as the Houghton, prevails. The population is mainly of Celtic \u201e Area Popula- Name. in Acres. tion.

COLONIAL EMPIRE. 89 origin, and a Celtic dialect, the Manx, is still spoken. The occurrence of numerous Norse names attests the presence of Norwegian settle ments. The Manx have their own parliament and j udicature, the repre sentative body being styled the \" House of Keys,\" and the judges \" deemsters.\" The laws are promulgated from a tumulus called the Tinwald. The towns are Douglas (12,511 inhab.) on the E. coast, the chief port, holding communication with Liverpool and Whitehaven, and now rising into favour as a watering place ; Castletown (2373) at the S. extremity, the residence of the governor ; Ramsey (2890) on the N.E. coast ; and Peel (2848) on the W. coast. The Isle of Man was fully acquired by the British crown from the Duke of Athol so lately as 1829, having been partly purchased in 1806. It had been the property ofthe Stanleys, from whom the Duke of Athol inherited it, since 1403. There are numerous Norse antiquities, and the remains of an abbey at Rushen. The Scilly Islands are a numerous group, situated about 30 m. S.W. of the Land's End, consisting of six inhabited and about 135 unin habited islands, with an aggregate area of 3560 acres and a population of 2431. The six inhabited islands are St. Mary, Tresco, St. Martin, St. Agnes, Bryher, and Sampson. Hugh Town, on St. Mary, ranks as the capital of the group. The islands are of granite formation and are suffering constant diminution from the effects of the waves on the surface of the cliffs. The climate is mild and stormy : trees almost unknown ; cattle diminutive ; the people poor, their chief employ ments being fishing and agriculture. The islands are held on lease from the Duchy of Cornwall. \u00a7 9. Colonial Empibe. \u2014 The colonial possessions of Great Britain are scattered over every quarter of the globe, and cover an area of above 8,000,000 sq. m., with a population of about 145,000,000, exclusive of the protected states of India, which are sometimes included in such estimates. It is the most extensive, and, next to China, the most populous empire in the world. The subjoined table gives a list of these possessions, with the date and mode of acquisition. The growth of this gigantic aggregation of territories is the work of the last 250 years. Most of them are colonies in the proper sense of the term, i. e. countries where our countrymen have effected permanent settlements, and form the bulk of the population : this is the case in North America, the Island of Bermuda excepted ; in Australasia, and in South Africa : in the last of which, however, the native exceeds the European population in numbers. Others are settlements for the purposes of commerce, and contain varying pro portions of Anglo-Saxon residents : in the West Indies, for instance, there are about 20 natives to one white ; in Ceylon 300 ; in Mauritius 150 ; while in British India the disproportion is much greater. A few are chiefly valuable in a military point of view, as Gibraltar, Malta, and Heligoland ; and others as depSts for our naval and com mercial marines, as St. Helena, Ascension, and Aden. Great Britain sustained a severe loss of territory through the successful revolution of her North American colonies in 1773-83. With that exception she"], [106, "90 THE BRITISH ISLES. Book I. has lost little. The surrender of the Ionian Isles to Greece in 1864, after a protectorate of 50 years, was a voluntary act on her part. * The \u25a0 Protected States\" are uot included in tbe estimate given. The area of these is put at 625,278 sq. m., and the population at 50,465,366.

Dimensions and Population. \u2014 The southern division of Great Britain comprises England and Wales. In its general outline South Britain approximates to a triangle, with its apex pointing N., and having the south coast as its base. The sides of this triangle measure respectively, the western 425 m. between Berwick and the Land's End, the eastern 345 m. between Berwick and the South Foreland ; and the southern 320 m. between the South Foreland and the Land's End. The extreme points are :\u2014 N., Berwick, 55\u00b0 46' N. lat. ; S., Lizard Point, 49\u00b0 58' N. lat. ; E., Lowestoft Ness, 1\u00b0 45' E. long. ; and W., Land's End, 5\u00b0 .45' W. long. The coast-line is estimated at between 1800 and 2000 m., the area at 58,320 sq. m. (50,922 for England, and 7398 for Wales), and the population at 20,066,224 (18,954,444 for England, and"], [109, "Chap. III. ENGLISH COASTS. 93 1,111,780 for Wales), thus giving a proportion of 344 inhabitants to a square mile. \u00a7 2. Coasts. \u2014 The \"coasts of England vary in character. As a general rule they are high and much indented. The eastern is the most regular, and the southern, as far W. as Selsey Bill, has the same character ; the eastern is also low from Flamborough Head southwards. A general survey shows the following as the most prominent irregularities : \u2014 (1) On the E. coast, from N. to S. \u2014 The estuary of the Humber ; the broad but shallow inlet of the Wash, intruding between the projecting coasts of Lincoln and Norfolk ; the estuary of the Thames ; and the prominent projection of Kent ending in the North Foreland. (2) On the S. coast, from E. to W. \u2014 The Isle of Wight, separated from the mainland by the Channel called the Solent ; the projection of the so-called Isle, but really peninsula of Portland, separating Weymouth Bay from the large open bay which extends W. to Start Point in Devonshire ; another large curve of the coast between Start Point and the lizard, and yet a third on a smaller scale between the Lizard and Land's End. (3) On the W. coast, from S. toN. \u2014 The Bristol Channel, the most important inlet in the whole island, penetrating inland between Wales and the S.W. counties of England, and gradually narrowing up until it terminates in the estuary of the Severn ; Carmarthen Bay, a large open bay on the S. coast of Wales ; Cardigan Bay, between the promontories of St. David's Head in Pembrokeshire and Braich-y-pwll in Carnarvon shire ; the Isle of Anglesey, forming the N.W. angle of Wales, divided from the mainland by the narrow Menai Strait ; Liverpool Bay, in the S.E. angle ofthe Irish Sea, with the estuaries of the Dee and Mersey; Morecambe Bay, more to the N. ; and Solway Firth, between Cumber land and Scotland, a large inlet which shoals as it advances inland until it becomes at low water a vast expanse of sand. In addition to the promontories already mentioned, we may notice : \u2014 E. coast, Flamborough Head, on the Yorkshire coast ; Spurn Head, at the entrance of the Humber ; the Naze, in Essex ; and the South Foreland, in Kent. S. coast, Dungeness, at the W. entrance of the Strait of Dover ; Beachy Head, the termination of the South Downs in Sussex ; Selsey Bill, E. of Portsmouth ; St. Alban's, or more properly St. Aldhelm's Head, in Dorset ; Portland Bill, the extremity of the Isle of Portland ; and Bolt Head, in Devon. W. coast, Hartland Point, in North Devon ; Worms Head, in Glamorgan ; Holyhead, the extremity of Holy Island adjacent to Anglesey ; Great Orme's Head, on the coast of North Wales ; and St. Bee's Head, at the S. entrance of the Solway Firth. Most of these promontories are lofty, and some of them are fine objects, particularly Flamborough, the Lizard, and Land's End ; Spurn Head, on the other hand, and Dungeness are very low."], [110, "94 ENGLAND AND WALES Book I, Changes in the Coast-line. \u2014 Numerous changes in the coast-line have occurred within the historical period, some of them produced by natural causes, others by man's hand, and others again by the joint action of the two. We have already noticed the traditional origin of the Goodwin Sands on the coast of Kent. On the W. frontier of that county an extensive plain, Romney Marsh, 14 m. long and 8 m. broad has been recovered from the sea by embankment aided by the silting up of the river courses. On this plain are several places that were once on the coast-line, as Lymne, the Portus Lemanus of the Romans, now 3 m. inland ; West Hythe, once a place of embarkation for Boulogne \u2022 New Romney, which itself succeeded to the port of Old Romney; and New Winchelsea; the three last belong to tbe Cinque Ports. The marsh now feeds large numbers of sheep and cattle. We may further notice the silting up ofthe channel which formerly separated the Isle of Thanet from Kent, and which was the ordinary route pursued by ships seeking the Thames, down to the reign of Henry VIII. This channel terminated S. at Sandwich, and N. at Reculver, and has been closed by the deposit of the Stour; the Old Roman port of Rutupi\u00e6, Kich- borough, is 2 m. inland from Sandwich. On the coast of Suffolk the sea has made serious encroachments ; Aldborough has suffered, and, still more notably, Dunwich, which has lost six out of the seven old churches that formerly attested its ecclesiastical importance, the remaining one being also in ruins. In Norfolk, the lower courses of the rivers Yare and Wensum were once estuaries, the former navigable to Norwich, the latter to Bungay, with a broad opening seawards at Yarmouth ; the Bure formed another such estuary. Along the N. coast the sea has encroached largely in the neighbourhood of Cromer, where it has submerged the site of old Cromer and the villages of Chipdem, Wimpwill, and Eccles, and now threatens Sheringham. The chan\u00bbes effected about the Wash by embankment will be described hereafter. Off the coast of Lincolnshire there is a submerged forest, and the inlets have changed, tbe ports of Waynfleet and (until recently) Grimsby having become choked. In the Humber a tract, known as the Sunk Island, containing 5550 acres, has been added to the land near Patring- ton. Off the Yorkshire coast, between Spurn Point and Bridlington, the sea encroaches ; Hornsea is said to have been once 10 m. inland ; Hyde, a neighbouring village, has disappeared ; so has Ravenspur, supposed to have stood near Kilnsea ; and Kilnsea itself is vanishing. On the coast of North Wales the Traeth Mawr, an inlet near Tremadoo, has been recovered by an embankment since 1807. In Cornwall the sea has encroached, particularly in Mount's Bay. In Sussex the channels have been much altered ; the Ouse has shifted its mouth from Seaford to Newhaven ; Lewes has ceased to be a port, and the islands of PevensCT and Selsey are joined to the land. \u00a7 3. Harbours.\u2014 England is supplied with a large amount of har bourage in the estuaries and inlets that fringe her shores; but the supply is unequally distributed, and is occasionally found where it is little wanted, in districts remote from the great centres of industry. The east coast suffers from a deficiency, which is particularly felt in consequence of the vast quantity of shipping engaged in the coal trade. In the N. the harbours are mostly at the river mouths, as in the case ot the Blyth, the Tyne (for Shields and Newcastle), the Wear (for Sunderland), and the Tees (for Stockton) ; these harbours have been"], [111, "Chap. III. HARBOURS. 95 much improved by artificial means, such as the removal of bars and the erection of piers. Hartlepool harbour is an exception to the above description, being formed by a small peninsula, from which a pier has been run out. On the Yorkshire coast, Whitby, Scarborough, and Bridlington (pronounced Burlington) are of little account, but the last is sheltered in N.E. gales by Flamborough Head. The Humber is a valuable inlet from its position relative to the Baltic and North Germany ; Hull and Grimsby are its chief ports. The Wash is both remote and difficult of access ; the ports of Boston and King's Lynn have only a local business. Yarmouth Roads are the only refuge for shipping off the coast of Norfolk, and the approach to these is dangerous. Thence to the Thames, Harwich alone calls for notice ; it is safe, well situated, and increasing in business. The estuary of the Thames is navigable for ships of burden up to London Bridge ; its position in reference to the continent, and the distance to which it is navigable, render its banks a fitting site for the capital of this country. The ports of Dover and Folkestone are needed for communication with France ; they are artificial rather than natural harbours. The great natural harbours of the south coast commence with Portsmouth, a deep and sufficiently large basin, with a splendid roadstead, Spithead, shielded from westerly gales by the Isle of Wight. Southampton Water is a long inlet close by, very suitable for a packet station. Poole Harbour is an extensive sheet of water with a narrow entrance, encumbered with a bar, and hence difficult of access. Portland Roads in Weymouth Bay afford safe anchorage in all weathers, being protected partly by nature and partly by a magnificent breakwater. The estuaries of the Exe and the Teign are accessible for ships of small burden. Tor Bay offers protection to any amount of shipping in westerly gales. Dartmouth Harbour is a small but secure basin at the mouth of the Dart. Plymouth Sound, protected at its entrance by its famous breakwater, and running up into several creeks or small bays, is admirably adapted to the purposes of a great naval station. Falmouth Bay is another inlet of similar character and of great capacity, but somewhat remote. On the west coast we may notice on the S. side of the Bristol Channel St. Ives Bay, with the improved ports of St. Ives and Hay le ; Padstow Bay, a sheltered inlet ; Barnstaple Bay, with an inlet navigable for coasting vessels up to Barnstaple ; and the Avon, which furnishes access to the great port of Bristol: on the N. side of the Bristol Channel, the estuary of the Usk, on which stands Newport ; Cardiff, sheltered by Penarth Head ; and Swansea Bay, partially enclosed by the Mumbles ; the ports at these spots have been much improved by art, particularly Cardiff. At the S.W. angle of Wales is the magni ficent landlocked inlet of Milford Haven, and at the N.W. angle the port of Holyhead, now converted into a harbour of refuge by a"], [112, "ENGLAND AND WALES. Book I. 96 fine breakwater. The estuary of the Dee is navigable up to Chester, but is much encumbered with sandbanks ; that of the Mersey con stitutes the port of Liverpool ; the Kibble is navigable to Preston, and the Lune to Lancaster, but in neither case for ships of large size. N. of Morecambe Bay there is no natural harbour of any account : Whitehaven is an improved tidal harbour, and there are ports of less capacity at Maryport and at Silloth. \u00a7 4. Mountains. \u2014 In the N. of England a well-defined dorsal chain, generally known as the Pennine Chain, emanates from the Cheviot Hills on the borders of Scotland, and runs S. to 53\u00b0 N. lat., dividing the island unequally into a larger eastern and a smaller western portion, and forming the watershed between the Irish and North Seas. The culminating heights of this chain are Cross Fell (2901 ft.), near the point where the counties of Durham, Cumber land, and Westmoreland unite ; Whernside (2384 ft.), near Kirkby Lonsdale ; and Ingleborough (2361 ft.), a little more to the S. West ward of this chain, and separated from it by the broad valley of the Eden, lie the Cumbrian Mountains, grouped in a compact circular mass, and containing the highest summits in England (exclu sive of Wales), viz., Scawfell (3229 ft.), HelveUyn (3055 ft.), and Skiddaw (3022 ft.). Tha Pennine Chain subsides into the elevated ground that separates the basin of the Trent from the Cheshire Plain, and the Vale of the Severn. The line of elevation is resumed in the Cotswold Hills, which separate the basin of the Thames from the Vale of the Severn, and so constitute the water shed between the Atlantic and the North Sea. Westward of the line of heights thus indicated, and separated from it by the Plain of Cheshire and the Vale of the Severn are the Cambrian Mountains, which cover the greater part of Wales. The central range or back bone of this system assumes a curved form, not unlike that of the coast of Cardigan Bay ; from this numerous lateral ridges diverge on each side, giving to the whole a very knotty and complicated appearance. Of the special points and ranges we may notice Snowdon (3571 ft.), in Carnarvonshire; the Berwyn Hills, which divide the basins of the Dee and the Severn ; Cader Idris (2914 ft.), the culminating point of a range which holds the same direction as the Berwyn Hills, on the other (W.) side of the central range ; Plyn limmon (2463 ft.), at the head of the Severn and the Wye ; the Kerry Hills, curving round S.E. and N.E. along the course of the Severn ; the Epynt Hills, between the Wye and the head of the Usk ; the Black Mountains, a range running on the S. side of the Usk, and containing the Brecon Beacon (2862 ft.), and the Carmarthen Beacon (2596 ft.) ; and a second range of the same name, between the Wye and the Usk, with the Cader (2545 ft.) for its highest point."], [113, "Chap. III. MOUNTAINS AND PLAINS. 97 Secondary Mountain-Ranges.\u2014 Tn addition to the important ranges above noticed, there are lines of less elevation, which exercise con siderable influence on the physical character of the country. In the N.E. a series of heights skirts the coast between the Tees and the Wash. broken only at the outlet of the Humber, and converting the Plain of York into an inland basin ; the series consists of the North York Moors, whose highest point is Burton Head (1485 ft.) ; the York Wolds, which only rise to a height of 809 ft. in Wilton Beacon; and the Lincolnshire Wolds. S. of the Wash a line of high ground may bo traced along the E. side of the basin of the Ouse. containing the Gog-Magog Hills (302 ft.) near Cambridge, Kensworth Hill (9u2 ft.) near Dunstable, and the Chiltern Hills between this and Pangbourne : the line is continued on the opposite side of the Thames in the Downs of Berkshire. Between the Thames aud the English Channel tbe most marked features are the lines of Downs which, starting from different points on the coast, converge towards Salisbury Plain as their common centre. The North Downs rise near Dover and trend away to the N.W. as far as the Medway and thence to the W., their line being broken at various points by the streams which seek the Thames. The South Downs rise at Beachy Head, and gradually diverge from the sea-coast in the direction of Winchester and Salisbury ; these are also pierced at various points by the streams that seek the Channel. The North and South Downs are connected by a transverse ridge called the Alton Hills in about 1\u00b0 W. long. The Dorset Heights rise near Lyme Regis, and bear away N.E. to Salisbury Plain, emitting au offset, which fringes the coast to the Isle of Purbeck. The S.W. angle of England from the Bristol Avon is a varied region of hill and dale, the chief features being the Mendip Hills, between Shepton Mallet and the Bristol Channel ; the Quantock Hills, on the W. side of the river Parret ; Exmoor, a continuation of the range just mentioned, along the Bristol Channel ; Dartmoor, a rugged highland in the S. of Devon, attaining in Cawsand Beaeon an elevation Of 1792 ft. ; and the Cornish Heights, which traverse the peninsula in proximity to its N. coast throughout. \u00a7 5. Plains. \u2014 The whole of eastern and south-eastern England may be regarded as a great plain subdivided by the heights we have been describing, and varying considerably in elevation in its various parts. The most noticeable subdivisions are : \u2014 (1) The Plain of York, which extends from the Tees to the Don, between the Pennine Bange on the W., and the Wolds on the E. (2) The Fens, a low region about the Wash, described below. (3) The Central Table-land, in North amptonshire, where the rivers Avon, Welland, Soar, and Nen, have their sources in close proximity. (4) The Weald of Surrey, Sussex, and Kent, enclosed between the North and South Downs. (5) Salisbury Plain, an undulating open table-land extending 20 m. N. of Salisbury. Lastly, (6) the Plain of Cheshire, lying S.W. of the Pennine range about the basins of the Mersey and the Dee. Among the vales especially famous for their expanse of rich soil, may be noticed those of Belvoir in Nottinghamshire, Aylesbury in Bucking hamshire, Pewsey in Wiltshire, Blackmore in Dorsetshire, Taunton in Somersetshire, Worcester on the mid-course of the Severn, MOD. GEO. f"], [114, "ENGLAND AND WALES. Book I. 98 Berkeley in Gloucestershire along the left bank of the Severn, and Evesham in Worcestershire along the Avon. The Fens. \u2014 The Fen district spreads inland from the Wash, covering an area of about 680,000 acres, in a length of about 65 m., and a breadth of about 25 m. It is divided into 3 portions, the North Level between Peterborough and Wisbeach, the South Level near Ely, and the Middle Level between the two. The whole of it was once a dreary swamp, liable to the overflow of the rivers Ouse, Nen, and Welland, and to the influx of high tides. Large meres were thus formed, out of which a few elevated spots rose like islands. From the earliest times measures have been taken to reclaim this district. The Romans con structed a sea wall E. of Wisbeach, the course of which is marked by the names Walsoken, Walton, and Walpole. The banks at Po-Dyke, and the long cut named Carr-Dyke, between the Nen and the Witham, are also attributed to them. The monastic establishments planted on the eminences, at that time islands, of Ely, Croyland, Thorney, and Ramsey, shut out the waters in their own neighbourhoods. But no general measure was attempted until Henry VIII.'s reign, when Morton, Bishop of Peterborough, made a direct channel for the Nen from Peterborough to the sea. In Charles I.'s reign the Earl of Bedford made a new and straight channel for the Ouse, 21 m. long, now known as the Old Bedford River. His successor formed the New Bedford River, 20 m. long, parallel to it. Various other drains, cuts, and em bankments, were made at this same period. The drainage of the Fens was improved, but not perfected, by these measures, and the work has been continued almost to tbe present day, the most important undertakings in modern times being the Eau Brink Cut, in 1821, by which the channel of the Ouse above Lynn was straightened; and the new outfall for the Nen, in 1834, whereby the North Level was drained. Whittlesea and Ramsey meres have been turned into dry land. Wisbeach, which formerly stood, as its name ( = Ousebeach) implies, at the mouth of the Ouse, is now 7 m. from the coast. The reclamation of land about the Wash is still proceeding, and a consider able breadth of soil, named Victoria Land, has been gained. \u00a7 6. Hydrography. \u2014 The westerly position of the Pennine Chain has the effect of throwing the long slope towards the North Sea and the short one towards the Irish Sea ; we should therefore expect to find the most developed river-system in the former direction, and a glance at the map will show on the E. side of the chain the Humber, with its numerous affluents radiating towards it from all directions, and on the W. side of the chain streams of less import ance. It is only in this part of England that the watershed is of a decisive and well-defined character ; but S. of the Pennine range the long slope still continues in the direction of the North Sea. The Warwickshire Avon is the only instance of a river seeking the W. from the central regions. The Cotswold Hills, at the head of the Thames, mark the full extension of the easterly slope, though they do not form a perfect watershed, inasmuch as the Somersetshire Avon rises E. of them. Next to the North Sea the Bristol Channel is the receptacle of the largest amount of drainage ; its chief slope is from N.W. to S.E., as marked by the courses of the Severn and iu"], [115, "Chap. III. HYDROGRAPHY. 99 chief affluents, the Wye and the Usk. The Bristol Channel also receives the drainage of Somersetshire, Glamorganshire, and Car marthenshire. The Irish Sea receives the streams that rise on the W. flank of the Pennine range together with those of the north and west coasts of Wales. The English Channel has its longest slope 32. The Bristol Avon, with the Clifton Suspension BriJsc. along the course of the Hampshire Avon ; numerous small rivers penetrate the South Downs to it, and it receives the chief drainage of Devon and Cornwall.

Rivers. \u2014 From the above table it will be seen that the Thames has the longest stream, and the Humber the largest basin, while the Severn holds an intermediate place, exceeding the first in basin-area and the second in length. The great Ouse holds the fourth place in both respects : then follow in order of length the Nen, Dee, Tees, Tyne, Eden, Witham, Avon (Hants), and Mersey, but in order of basin-area the Mersey, Avon, Tare, Witham, Tyne, Eden, Dee, and Tees. The commercial value of the rivers differs widely: those which descend from the Pennine range are generally applicable to machinery, those of the plains to navigation. A network of canals, described in a future paragraph, connects the chief of them together. We add a brief description of the three most important rivers, viz.\u2014 the Thames, the Severn, and the Humber. (1) The Thames rises on the E. side of the Cotswold range, and is formed by the junction of several small streams, which in their order from W. to E., are the. Isis, the Churn (of Cirencestei\u2014 Churn-cester), the Coin, the Leach Lech-lade), the Windrush, and the Evenlode. The first is the reputed Thames, but the Churn from its greater length has the best claim to be considered as such. The Thames sub sequently receives the Cherwell at Oxford from Northamptonshire, the Thame at Dorchester from Buckinghamshire, and the \"Rennet at Reading 2. Rivers seeking the Bristol Channel.

EIVERS, LAKES, AND FORESTS. 101 from Wiltshire. The Medway joins tbe estuary of the Thames at the Isle of Sheppey, and may almost be regarded as an independent river : it drains the Weald of Kent, piercer the North Downs near Maidstone f = Medway' s townj, and widens into a considerable estuary of its own below Chatham. (2) The Severn rises in Plynlimmon, and flows N.E. to its junction with tbe Vyrnwy : then emerging from the mountains it flows E. to Shrewsbury, S.E. to its junction with the Warwickshire Avon, and finally S.W. to the Bristol Channel. It receives on its right bank from the Welsh mountains the Teme below Worcester, the Wye, and the Usk ; and on its left bank, tbe Tern below Shrewsbury, the Avon from Warwickshire, and the Avon from Wiltshire. (3 ) The Humber is the recipient of the Ouse and the Trent with their various tributaries. The Trent rises in the W. of Staffordshire and runs first S.E., then N.E., and finally N., receiving on its left bank the Dove, the Derwent, and the Idle, and on its right bank the Tame and the Soar. The Ouse is the recipient of all the rivers that traverse the Yorkshire dales, commencing with the Swale and the Ure, whose united streams assume thenceforth the name of Ouse, and afterwards inter cepting, as it flows to the S.E., the Nidd, the Wharfe, the Aire, and the Don. \u00a7 8. Lakes. \u2014 The lakes of England and Wales are more celebrated for their beauty than for their size or commercial value. The Eng lish lakes are grouped together amid the Cumbrian mountains, and have each its distinctive character of scenery. We may specify the following : \u2014 The Welsh lakes are both less numerous and less attractive than the Cumbrian : the chief in North Wales are \u2014 Bala Lake, about 4 m. long; the two lakes of Llanberris, the larger of which is 1J m. in length ; and Llyn Ogwen, about 1 m. long. South Wales possesses only one of any size, viz. Langorse Pool in Brecknockshire, about 3 m. long. \u00a7 9. Fokests. \u2014 The existing forests are insignificant as compared with those which once spread over the face of the country. In many instances the names and a certain amount of woodland indicate the districts where the forests stood. This is the case with the Weald (a Saxon term for ' wood ') of Kent and Sussex ; the Wolds (a modifica tion of the same word) of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire ; Arden (a word allied to the ' Ardennes ' of Belgium) in Warwickshire ; and Sherwood, Name.

ENGLAND AND WALES. 102 in Nottinghamshire, the relics of which still adorn the fine parks of that county. The Weald is the remains of the great forest of Andreade, which down to a late period supplied fuel for the iron works of that district. There are but two Royal Forests of any size, New Forest, in Hampshire (66,942 acres) and Dean Forest, in Glou cestershire (23,015 acres). The areas enclosed for the growth of timber in these forests are 6000 and 11,000 acres respectively ; so that Dean Forest contains the largest amount of actual forest. The other royal forests are of minor importance ; they are situated in the following localities :\u2014 Windsor (Berks) ; Alice Holt, Woolmer, and Bere (Hants); Whittlebury, and Salcey (Northamptonshire) ; Whichwood (Oxfordshire) ; Waltham (Essex) ; and Delamere (Cheshire). The total area of the Crown Forests amounts to 122,622 acres, and the amount actually under timber to about 45,000 acres. \u00a7 10. Minerals. \u2014 The mineral resources of England and Wales are varied and very valuable. Coal and iron are not only abundant, but lie in close contiguity, a circumstance which above any other has facilitated the manufacture of iron. The coal measures occupy an area of 4100 sq. m., the most extensive fields being designated as follows :\u2014 (1) The Northumberland and Durham field, stretching N. and S. between the Coquet and Tees, and skirting the coast N. of the Tyne. (2) The Yorkshire and Derbyshire field, between Leeds and Nottingham, extending N. and S., and attaining its greatest breadth in Yorkshire. (3) The South Lancashire field, extending E. and W., from the Pennine range to near the estuary of the Mersey. (4) The South Staffordshire or Dudley field, extending N. and S., and containing the thickest bed in England. (5) The South Wales field, the most important of all, stretching away from St. Bride's Bay, in Pembrokeshire, to Pontypool, in Monmouthshire, a distance of about 100 m., and increasing in breadth from W. to E. Coalfields of minor importance occur near Whitehaven in Cumberland; at Burnley in N. Lancashire ; about the Potteries in Staffordshire ; ia Flintshire, from the estuary of the Dee to Oswestry ; about Coal brookdale, in the valley of the Severn ; about Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire; between Coventry and Tamworth, in Warwick shire ; in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire ; and, lastly, on both sides of the Bristol Avon, in Gloucestershire and Somersetshire. Iron is found contiguous to coal in the South Wales, South Staffordshire, Yorkshire and Derbyshire, Whitehaven. Flint, Coalbrookdale, Potteries, and Forest of Dean fields, and in detached districts in Lancashire near Ulverstone, in Northamptonshire, North Somersetshire, and Cornwall. Copper is found chiefly in Cornwall and Devonshire, and in less quantities in Anglesea (where the once valuable Parys Mine is located), Denbighshire, and Cumberland. Tin is confined to Corn-"], [119, "Chap. III. MINERALS AND POPULATION. 103 wall and Devon. Lead occurs in Cumberland, Durham, Derbyshire, N. Somersetshire, Devon, Cornwall, Denbighshire, Flintshire, and Cardiganshire. Silver is found only in combination with lead, and gold about Dolgelly and elsewhere in Wales, where mines have been started with doubtful success. Of other minerals we may notice salt in Cheshire and at Droitwich in Worcestershire ; zinc in Derby shire, Flint, and the Isle of Man ; manganese in Devon, Cornwall, and near Coventry in Warwickshire ; slate in N. Wales, near Bangor, Llanberris, and Festiniog ; china-clay in Cornwall ; gypsum in various places on the new Red Sandstone formation ; marble in Dorsetshire (Purbeck); granite in Devon and Cornwall; and Port land stone on the peninsula of that name in Dorsetshire. Mineral Springs. \u2014 The most valuable mineral springs are found in the following localities : \u2014 Harrogate in Yorkshire (chalybeate, sul phureous, and saline) ; Cheltenham in Gloucestershire (saline and sulphureous); Leamington in Warwickshire (chalybeate, sulphureous, and saline); Bath (saline with carbonic aeid); and Buxton (mag nesia and soda). The virtues of the last two depend partly on their temperature, Bath waters being decidedly hot, ranging from 1 09\u00b0 to 117\u00b0 Fahr., and Buxton tepid, about 82\u00b0. The waters of Clifton Hotwells, are also tepid (74\u00b0), and those of Matlock in Derbyshire (68\u00b0). We may further notice Tunbridge Wells in Kent (chalybeate), Ashby-de-la- Zouch in Leicestershire (saline with muriate of magnesia), Scarborough in Yorkshire (chalybeate), and Bakewell in Derbyshire (saline and tepid). \u00a7 11. Population. \u2014 The growth of the population of England and Wales during the last 100 years has been most rapid. In 1751 it amounted to about 7 millions, in 1801 to 9 millions, and in 1861 to above 20 millions. The increase is mainly due to the pro gress of manufactures and commerce, and is most marked in the large towns and manufacturing districts. London, for instance, has in the present century increased from 958,863, to 2,803,989 ; Birken head from 110 to 51,649 ; Manchester and Salford from 24,867 to 441,171 ; Cheltenham from 3,076 to 39,693 ; Brighton from 7440 to 77,693, and Merthyr Tydvil from 10,127 to 83,875. In regard to occupation, the leading pursuits are manufactures, agriculture, and commerce. The number of persons engaged in these several depart ments in 1861 was as follows : \u2014 Manufactures and mining .. .. 4,828,399 Agriculture 2,010,454 Commerce 623,710 (1) Manufactures. \u2014 The principal branches of the industrial pursuits are the manufacture of cotton (in which 407,598 people were employed in 1861), woollen and worsted goods, iron and hardware, earthenware, and hosiery; mining (in which about 300,000 are employed), and ship building. The geographical distribution of the manufacturing population is dependent partly on natural, partly on accidental circumstances. The"], [120, "Book I. 104 ENGLAND AND WALES. proximity of a coalfield decides the point in many instances ; for, even where the raw material is bulky, it is generally found more practicable to bring it to the coal than to take the coal to it \u2014 an instance of which is furnished by the copper-ore of Cornwall being taken to Swansea to be smelted. The iron manufacture is carried on entirely at the coal fields, the chief seats being South Wales, Staffordshire, and Derby shire. The cotton manufacture has been located in Lancashire and Cheshire for the last three centuries ; but it has attained its present dimensions very much through these counties being readily furnished with the raw material from America, as well as from the abundance of coal: outside these counties, Glossop, Belper, and Carlisle are the chief seats of the manufacture. The woollen manufacture is chiefly carried on in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and its location here is probably due to the abundant water-power offered for working the mills. Silk-weaving was introduced into England by French refugees who settled in Spitalfields : it is still carried on there, but on a small scale as compared with places where power-looms are employed, as at Macclesfield, Mauchester, and Congleton. Silk-throwing by machinery was first practised at Derby and has extended from there to Leek and Macclesfield. Norwich has been the seat of the bombasine manufacture since the time when the Flemings settled there in 1569. The silk manufacture was similarly introduced into Essex (Colchester) in 1571. Hosiery is largely carried on at Leicester, Nottingham, and some neighbouring towns, in consequence of the wool of those counties having been adapted to articles of that kind, and the manufacture of cloths is located in Gloucestershire, Somersetshire &c., for a similar reason. The ribbon and watch manufactures were introduced into Coventry about 1730. (2) Agriculture. \u2014 The soil of England is generally of a productive character, the amount of uneultivable land being only about 3J millions out of a total of about 32^ millions of acres. The proportion of uneultivable soil in Wales is considerably larger, amounting to about one-fourth of the whole. The advance in the application of science and mechanical skill to farming operations has been very remarkable, and the produce of the land has been proportionably increased. The cultivated land of England is pretty equally divided between pasturage and tillage, the latter being more especially the characteristic of the eastern and south-eastern counties. The pasturage counties, as we may call them in contradistinction to the others, fall into two classes accord- ing as they are adapted for dairy produce or for breeding and fattening cattle. Cheshire, Wilts, Dorset, Gloucestershire, and Devon, may be classed under the former head ; Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Somerset, and part of Yorkshire, under the latter. Wales is more adapted for breeding than for fattening sheep and cattle. The grain-crops are wheat, barley, and oats, the first being more especially produced in the eastern and south-eastern, the second in the midland, and the third iu the northern counties and in Wales. Among special products may be noticed hops, which are grown in Kent, Surrey, and Herefordshire, and the orcharding of Devonshire and Herefordshire. \u00a7 12. Political Divisions. \u2014 England and AVales are divided into 52 counties or shires, 40 belonging to England and 12 to Wales. This division dates from a very early period, and appears to have been one of gradual growth and not based on any uniform principle."], [121, "Chap. III. POLITICAL DIVISIONS. 105 Thus some of the counties represent the old divisions of the Saxon period, as Essex the \"East Saxons,\" S ussex the \" South Saxons,\" Middlesex the \" Middle Saxons,\" Norfolk and Suffolk \" the north and south folk \" or peoples of East Anglia. The termination -set in Somerset, Dorset, and contracted in Wilts ( = Wilset), implies bodies of Saxon settlers (scetan ssssz to \" settle \") in those districts. Some of the northern counties carry us back to the British period. The county, though not the name, of York answers to the British Deifr or Deira, Cumberland to Cumbria or Strathclyde, which ex tended from the Mersey to the Clyde, and Northumberland to Northumbria. The names of other counties (chiefly those of Mercia) are derived from their capital towns, as proved by the local terminations of -bridge in Carnirjtfgeshire, -ford in Ox/orrfshire, &c. ; -burgh in Shropshire ( = Scrobbes-ii/rjtjrshire), -by in Deris/shire, -cester in Gloucestershire; to which we may add, -ham, -ton, -bury, and -wick. The Mercian shires were probably coDStituted in Alfred's time. The subdivision of the Northern kingdoms or earldoms of Northumbria and Cumbria into the present counties was effected at a later period, probably subsequently to the conquest, and that of Wales in the reigns of Edward I. and Henry VIII. Subdivisions of Counties. \u2014 The subdivisions of counties are also of great antiquity, and present many peculiarities. The usual subdivisions are into hundreds and parishes ; but in addition to these, the follow ing 4 counties have larger divisions : \u2014 York into 3 ridings (a term expressive of third parts, but whether of Saxon or Danish origin is uncertain) ; Lincoln similarly into 3 parts, Lindsey, Kesteven, and Holland ; Sussex into 6 rapes (es, term of unknown meaning) ; and Kent into 4 lathes (supposed to be derived from the Saxon ge-lalhian, \"to assemble\"). York, Lincoln, and Nottingham, have, moreover, a peculiar term as an equivalent for the \" hundred \" of other counties, viz. : \u2014 wapentake (derived from the Danish vaabenfag, \" clash of arms \" as the manner in which assent was expressed in the public meetings) : Cumberland and Westmoreland substitute the term ward. Taking hundreds and wapentakes together, there are about 800 in England and Wales, varying in size from an average of 14,400 acres in Kent to 63,000 acres in Shropshire, and with name3 derived in 362 cases from those of parishes, &c, but in the other cases differing from them. The origin of the hundred is a moot point ; it was probably so much laud as would support 100 or 120 free families, each family possessing a hide = 100 to 120 acres. But at a very early period the numerical idea was lost, and the name signified a territorial division irrespective of size. A further subdivision is into parishes, which, though originally of an ecclesiastical nature, also serves many civil purposes ; large parishes are subdivided into townships. Ecclesiastical Divisions. \u2014 For ecclesiastical purposes England and Wales are divided into \u2014 2 Provinces, under the Archbishops of Canter bury and York; 28 Dioceses, two of which are under the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, and the other 26 under the Bishops of London, Winchester, Ely, Lincoln, Bath and Wells, Salisbury, Exeter, Chichester, Rochester, Oxford, Gloucester and Bristol, Worcester, Hereford, Peter- F 3"], [122, "Book I. 106 ENGLAND AND WALES. borough, Lichfield, Norwich, St. David's, Llandaff, St. Asaph, Bangor, Chester, Manchester, Ripon, Carlisle, Durham, and Sodor and Man, the six last being in the province of York, the others in that of Can terbury. The bishoprics are distinguished as old and new foundations, the new comprising the following five founded by Henry VIII.- \u2014 Glou cester, Bristol, Peterborough, Oxford, and Chester ; and two founded in William IV.'s reign, viz., Manchester and Ripon. The bishoprics of Gloucester and Bristol were united at this last period ; Bath and Wells as early as 1136. The name \"Sodor\" dates from the period when the Hebrides, together with Man, were under Norwegian supremacy, and were described as the Sudoreyar or \" Southern Isles.\" They formed a diocese in the province of Drontheim, under a bishop whose See was on Iona. \u00a7 13. The towns of England and Wales will be more fully noticed under their respective counties in the next chapter. A general view, however, of the more important under their several classes may not be out of place here. London stands pre-eminent in size as well as in dignity, the seat of government and of the high courts of judicature, and the focus of the commercial transactions not only of the British Empire but of the civilized nations of the whole world. 33. London, with the new Bridge at biackfriars. Next to it, though far behind in point of population, comes Liverpool (including West Derby and Birkenhead), and then, in the order of population, Manchester (with Salford), Birmingham (with Aston), Leeds, Sheffield, Bristol (with Clifton), Newcastle-on-Tyne (with Gateshead), Plymouth (with Devonport and Stonehouse), Bradford, and Portsmouth (with Gosport, Landport, and Portsea). These places all have a population exceeding 100,000, and they represent"], [123, "107 Chap. III. TOWNS. several of the leading branches of British industry \u2014 Manchester, the cotton manufacture ; Leeds and Bradford, the woollen manufacture ; Sheffield, cutlery ; Birmingham, hardware ; Liverpool, the import of the raw and the export of the manufactured material of cotton ; Newcastle-on-Tyne, the export of coal ; and Bristol, the general business of a commercial town apart from the great manufacturing centres. The two remaining towns, Portsmouth and Plymouth, are the seats of the great establishments, by which the naval supremacy of this country is sustained. The geographical distribution of the commercial towns is also observable : six are located in the N., viz. : Liverpool and Manchester, in Lancashire ; Newcastle, in Northumber land ; and Leeds, Bradford, and Sheffield, in Yorkshire : two are in the central districts, Wolverhampton and Birmingham : and one in the S.W., Bristol. Descending below 100,000, we come to Hull, Oldham, Sunderland, Preston, Brighton, Norwich, Nottingham, Bolton, Leicester, Blackburn, Wolverhampton, Stockport, and Bath. This list introduces a new class of town, viz., the residential, as represented by Brighton and Bath. Of the rest, Hull and Sunderland are seaports, the former connected with the manufacturing districts, the latter with the coal export ; Oldham, Preston, Bolton, Blackburn, and Stock port, are engaged in cotton manufacture, Wolverhampton in iron, Leicester and Nottingham in hosiery and lace, and Norwich in silk. To this list we may add the aggregate of towns and villages which make up the parliamentary boroughs of Stoke-upon-Trent and Merthyr- Tydvil ; the former representing the pottery, and the latter the iron manufacture of South Wales. The geographical distribution of these towns is again observable, as showing the great preponderance of the North, the two ports and the five cotton towns being in that direction : the south possesses only the two residential towns ; the others are located in the midland districts, with the exception of Norwich in the eastern counties. Cities and Boroughs. \u2014 \" City \" is a term of dignity rather than of legal force, and is applied in usage to municipal towns that are the Sees of bishops, as well as to Westminster, which was once in that position. \" Boroughs \" are towns which either have municipal organization, or are entitled to return members of Parliament ; the former class are termed Municipal boroughs, the latter Parliamentary boroughs. The majority of large towns are boroughs in both senses ; but there are numerous small municipal boroughs which have no representative privileges, and a few Parliamentary boroughs, as Cheltenham, Bury, Rochdale, &c, which have no corporations. The municipal boroughs are the true represent atives of the ancient Saxon burghs, which were nothing else than a hundred enclosed within a wall, and consequently had all the privileges of self-government possessed by the hundred. Indeed some of the towns rank as counties, having been able to preserve their independ ence of the surrounding districts -, this is the ease with 11 of the cities, aud the following 7 towns, viz., Kingston-on-Hull, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Nottingham, Poole, Southampton, Carmarthen, and Haverfordwest. NuTnber, Origin, and Arrangement of Towns. \u2014 There are 815 towns in"], [124, "Book I. 108 ENGLAND AND WALES. England and Wales situated at an average distance of about 11 miles from each other. Various circumstances have decided the positions of towus \u2014 the existence of a ford or bridge across a river, as instanced in Oxford and Cambridge; a natural harbour ; a road, particularly one of the old Roman roads, as indicated in the syllable street or strat in the names of places ; a Roman camp, as indicated in the affixes, Chester, cester, caster, and eter, and in the Welsh prefix, car or caer ; a mineral spring ; a stroug post, adapted for defence iu troublous times; the introduction of manufactures, &c. The arrangement of the English towns is most various; the only ones which exhibit any uniformity are those built on the sites of old Roman camps, which retain the original quadrangular disposition, with the main steets radiating from a common centre to the 4 points of the compass, as at Gloucester, Dorchester, &c. Antiquities. \u2014 The early inhabitants of England and Wales have left numerous evidences of their presence behind them. These fall under the following chief heads : \u2014 (1) Intrenched camps, situated on the tops of hills or eminences, such as Maiden Castle, near Dorchester, which encloses an area of 44 acres, and the camp on the summit of one of the Malvern Hills. (2) Circles of stones, of which those at Stonehenge and Avebury are well-known examples ; in Cornwall, where these circles are numerous, they are named Dawns Men, \"stone dance.\" (3) Single stones or obelisks, such as the Devil's Arrows, near Boroughbridge, York shire, 3 immense masses, 22J, 21J, and 16^ ft. high. (4) Dwellings and villages, traces of which are found on the wolds of Yorkshire, and the chalk hills of Berkshire. (5) Tumuli or mounds of earth, the largest specimen of which is Silbury Hill in Wilts, covering an area of 50 acres and 165 ft. high. (6) Cromlechs, for burial pur poses, such as Kit's Coty House in Kent; and Lanyon in Cornwall. (7) Barrows, also for burial pur poses, most numerous on the chalk hills of Wilts and Dorset, occa sionally of great size, as the King- Barrow, near Warminster, 206 ft. long, 56 wide, and 15 high. (8) Ancient boundaries, such aa Wansdyke, supposed to have once extended from the Thames to the Severn. Roman remains are too 34. Kit's Coty House. various to be enumerated ; their roads, walls, camps, towns, villas, and altars, survive to tell of their long tenure of the country, and of the civilization which then prevailed in it. Communications. \u2014 England stands pre-eminent among the nations of the world for the excellence of her communications. Her progress in this matter during the last 100 years is truly surprising. In the middle of the 18th century the roads were in so defective a state that no public conveyances could travel. Coaches were started between Manchester and London in 1754, between Edinburgh and London in 1763, and between Liverpool and Manchester in 1767. The improve ment of the Great Northern road was consequent upon tbe rebellion of 1745, and was intended for military rather than commercial purposes. But the increasing business of the country necessitated easy and rapid communications, and during the latter part of the 18th and the early"], [125, "Chap. III. COMMUNICATIONS. 109 part of the 19th centuries road-making was scientifically prosecuted, the greatest achievement in this line being the Holyhead road, which was constructed by Telford in 1815-1830 for the purpose of facilitating intercourse with Ireland. The construction of canals for the convey ance of heavy goods was carried on during the same period, the first great work of this kind being the Bridgewater Canal, 34 in. long, between Worsley, Manchester, and Runcorn on the Mersey, which was completed in 1773 ; and the second, the Grand Trunk Canal, 89 m. long, connecting the Mersey and the Trent, completed in 1777. Shortly after this a network of canals spread over the country, connect ing the navigable rivers with one another. Thus the Thames was united to the Severn by the Kennet and Avon Canal; by the Wilts and Berkshire Canal, which leaves the Thames near Abingdon; and by the Thames and Severn Canal, which leaves the former river near Lechlade, and descends the Stroud valley ; it was also joined to the Mersey and Trent by the Grand Junction Canal from London, and by the Oxford Canal from Oxford. The Severn was united to the Mersey by the Stafford and Worcester Canal, starting from Stourport on the Severn and terminating at the Grand Canal near Stafford; again by the Shrews bury, the Newport, and the Liverpool and Birmingham Canals ; and at a higher point on the Severn by the Ellesmere Canal, which also connects the Dee with the Mersey and Severn. The Pennine range, which separates the manufacturing districts of Yorkshire from Lancashire, is crossed by the Leeds and Liverpool, the Rochdale, and the Hudders field Canals, each of which forms a junction between the Irish and the North Seas. Numerous minor canals exist, contributing to make up a total length of about 2100 miles. Railways worked by steam-power are of more recent construction. The Stockton and Darlington, which led the way in this department, was opened in 1825. This was followed by the Manchester and Liverpool, opened in 1830, and this by the Grand Junction in 1837, between Birmingham and Warrington on the Liverpool and Manchester line. To trace the further progress of railways down to the present time would require more space than we can give. The most powerful systems at the present time are as follow: \u2014 (1) Great Western (1280 in.), connecting London with Oxford, Bristol, Exeter, and Penzance, in the S.W. ; Milford Haven in Wales ; Birmingham, Shrewsbury, Chester, and Birkenhead. (2) London and North-Western 1 1274 m.), connecting London with Birming ham, Manchester, Liverpool, Lancaster, Carlisle, Leeds, Shrewsbury, Chester, and Holyhead. (3) North Eastern (1194 m.), between Noi*manton, Leeds, York, Darlington, and Berwick-on-Tweed ; New castle and Carlisle ; South Durham and Lancashire. (4) Great Eastern (721 m.), connecting London with Yarmouth, through Cam bridge and Ely by one line, and through Colchester and Ipswich by another, and ramifying over the Eastern Counties to Lynn on the Wash, Peterborough, and other places. (5) Midland (673 m.), of which Derby may be regarded as the centre, and which thence ramifies S.W. to Birmingham and Bristol ; S.E. to Leicester, Bedford, and so on to London I independent line not yet completed) ; E. to Nottingham and Lincoln, and N. to Chesterfield and Normanton. (6) London and South- Western (490 m.), connecting London with the south coast at Southamp ton, and Weymouth, and with Exeter by way of Salisbury. < 7 ) South- Eastern, including the two lines by which the continental traffic is carried on through Dover, viz. : the South-Eastern proper via Tunbridge ; and the London, Chatham, and Dover.

London. \u2014 London stands on both sides of the Thames, at a distance of 60 m. by the river's course from the sea at the Nore, occupying portions of the counties of Middlesex, Surrey, and Kent. Taking the limits assigned to this vast city by the Metropolitan Government Act, its area equals 78,029 acres, or nearly 122 sq. m., and its population amounts to 2,803,989, which exceeds the aggre- gate population of the three most populous capitals of the continent \u2014 Paris, Berlin, and St. Petersburg \u2014 and also exceeds the aggregate population of the 15 next largest towns in England and Wales. The density of the population varies from 266 persons to the acre in the parishes of St. Botolph and Cripplegate, to 4 persons to the acre in the parish of Lewisham. In common parlance London (exclusive of the suburbs) is divided into three parts ;\u2014 the City, the West End, and the Borough ; the two former being separated by Temple Bar,"], [127, "Chap. IY. LONDON. 111 and the third being on the S. side of the river. For political purposes London is divided into 8 Parliamentary boroughs :\u2014 (1) The City of London, comprising the central district between Temple Bar and the Minories, which constitutes the nucleus of the metropolis. (2) West minster, which also ranks as a city, having been at one time the seat of a bishopric. (3) Marylebone, N. of Westminster, Oxford Street forming the line of demarcation between them. (4) Finsbury, N. of the City of London, and E. of Marylebone. (5) The Tower Hamlets, E. of the City and of Finsbury. (6) Southwark, on the S. side of the Thames, opposite the City. (7) Lambeth, W. of South wark. (8) Greenwich, E. of Southwark. The first division returns 4 members, and each of the others 2, making a total of 18. The \" City \" is divided into two portions, London within the Walls, and London without the Walls ; the former being the most ancient portion of all, enclosed within the old Boman walls. Portions of these walls still remain, and the line which they followed is marked by the names of the streets, Aldgate (=old gate), Bishopsgate, London Wall, Aiders gate, Castle Street, Cripplegate, Newgate, Old Bailey, and Ludgate. The portion subsequently added \" without the Walls \" extended W . to Temple Bar and Holborn Bars. The City is subdivided for muni cipal purposes into 26 wards, one of which is, nominally, in South wark. Of the streets, buildings, and objects of interest, it is im possible to give a detailed description ; some of the most important are mentioned below. History.\u2014 The name of London (from the Welsh llyn, \" pool,\" and din, \"elevated post\") bespeaks its Celtic origin. When the Romans invaded Britain, it was one of the largest towns in the country, and the seat of a considerable commerce. They constituted it their capital with the name of Augusta, and surrounded it with the walls already noticed, which were erected probably in the 2nd century of our era. During the Anglo-Saxon period London increased in wealth, and was enabled to resist the Danes on more than one occasion, particularly when besieged by Canute in 1016. William I. granted it a charter, and Henry I. did the same. In 1209 the bridge across the Thames was built, which lasted down to the present century. The progress of the town was for some centuries very slow. At the conclusion of Eliza beth's reign the population amounted to about 150,000, aud houses had been built outside of Temple Bar along the Strand, the district N. of the Strand being still open fields. In Charles I.'s reign a portion of these fields, between the Strand and Long Acre, was built over. In 1661 the population of London proper is estimated to have been 384,000. In 1666 occurred the great fire, which consumed St. Paul's Cathedral, and 13,000 out of 65,000 houses. The rebuilding of the city led to a further extension outside the walls, and the parish of St. James's to Piccadilly was built over in Charles II.'s reign. In 1700 Old Bond Street was built, and the population at this time probably amounted to about 530,000. In Ann's reign, Oxford Street and many of the streets run ning N. of that great thoroughfare were added. In 1777 the population may have been about 650,000. The progress of the city during the pre-"], [128, "ENGLAND AND WALES. Book I, 112 sent century has been amazing. In 1801 the population reached nearly a million (exactly 958,863) : it is now hard upon three millions (2 803 989). Buildinqs.\u2014 St. Paul's Cathedral, erected by Sir Christopher Wren (1675-1710) to replace the old edifice which had been destroyed in the grpat fire of 1 666 ; the burial-place of Nelson, Wellington, and other great warriors. The Royal Exchange (18-14), the successor of two buildings on the same site devoted to a similar purpose, the original one erected by Sir Thomas Gresham having perished in the great fire, and the next one also by fire in 1838. The Bank of England, covering 4 acres, built at different periods, commencing at 1732. The Guildhall (chiefly in 1789, restored in 1866), in King Street, the scene of corporation meetings for business and state festivities. The Mansion-house (1753), the official residence of the Lord Mayor. The General Post Office (1829i, in St. Martin's-le-Grand, with an Ionic front. The Custom house by the river's side, below London-bridge (1817). The Tower, overlooking the river, covering an area of 12 acres, the oldest part known as the White Tower erected about 1078. The Mint (1810), on Tower Hill. The Great Hall of Christ's Hospital (1829), in Newgate Street ; additional school- buildings having been added at various times siuce the foundation temp. Edward VI. Westminster Abbey, built at various periods between Henry III.'s and Charles II.'s reign, the most beautiful portion being Henry VII.'s chapel. The Abbey is one of our national mausoleums, and the place where the sovereigns are crowned. The Palace of Westminster, containing the Houses of Parliament and other offices ; a magnificent edifice, presenting a frontage of 900 ft. to the river: it was commenced in 1840 to replace the old Houses, which were burnt down in 1834. Bucking ham Palace, erected in George IV.'s reign, the town residence of the sovereign. The Government Offices, in Whitehall. The National Gal lery (1837), in Trafalgar Square. Somerset House (1782) in the Strand, facing the river, the seat of certain Government offices. The British Museum (1823), established in 1753, and now overstored with collec tions of natural history, art, and literature. Lincoln's Inn, with its Old and New Halls, the latter completed in 1845. The Inner and Middle Temple Inns of Court, with the beautiful old circular church belonging to them. Parks. \u2014 Hyde Park, at the W. end of London with Kensington Gardens adjacent to it : St. James's, in front of Buckingham Palace : the Green Park, between St. James's Park and Piccadilly : Regent's Park, in the N.W., constructed during the regency in George III.'s reign : Battersea Park, on the S. side of the Thames ; and Victoria Park, in the extreme E. of London. Columns. \u2014 The Monument (1677), near London Bridge, to comme morate the great fire, 202 ft. high. York Column (1833), N. of St. James's Park, 124 ft. high. Nelson Column, in Trafalgar Square, 176Jft. Bridges.\u2014 London (1831), Southwark (1819), Blackfriars (in build ing), Waterloo (1817), Westminster (1862), Vauxhall (1814), Railway bridges at Hungerford, Blackfriars and Cannon Street. Docks. \u2014 London Docks (1805), extent about 100 acres. St. Kathe rine's (1828), near the Tower, 24 acres. West India Docks (1802), near Blackwall, occupying with the City Canal 295 acres. East India Docks (1808), 30 acres, in the same neighbourhood. Commercial Docks, on the Surrey side of the river, 49 acres. Victoria Docks, near Blackwall. Drainage. \u2014 The gigantic works now in progress for carrying off tbe sewage and drainage of London, consist of 6 intercepting sewers, 3 on, each side of the river, at different levels, high, middle, and low, by"], [129, "Chap. IV. SOUTH-EASTERN COUNTIES. 113 means of which the sewage, instead of being deposited in the Thames at London, will be carried down to Barking on the 1. bank, and Erith on tbe r. bank, and will be there discharged at certain states of the tide, unless it be utilized by being carried down (as is proposed) to the Essex marshes. Suburbs. \u2014 The suburbs contain public buildings of importance, of which we may specify : \u2014 Chelsea Hospital, for invalid soldiers ( 1690) ; the Crystal Palace at Sydenham ; the Greenwich Hospital for disabled sailors (1698); the Observatory at the same place; the Woolwich Arsenal and Academy ; and the Thames Tunnel, between Wapping and Rother hithe, now about to be used for a Railway.

South-Eastern Counties. \u2014 These counties are agricultural, the only mineral product of commercial value being fullers' earth, which is found near Beigate. In the Wealden district are deposits of rich argillaceous iron-ore, which was converted into metal as long as the forests supplied fuel. The most noticeable productions of the soil are the hops of Surrey (Farnham) and Kent, the orchard ing of the latter county, the sheep of the Downs, and the hogs of Hampshire. Surrey has extensive heaths, and Hampshire pos sesses several of the royal forests, particularly the New Forest. Sussex is also well wooded in the Wealden district. The alluvial soils of the valleys in all of these counties afford rich pastures, and i The County Towns are distinguished by a thick black type."], [130, "Book I. 114 ENGLAND AND WALES. the recovered ground in Eomney Marsh has been already (cap. 3, \u00a7 2) noticed in this respect. Next to agriculture, the most im portant branch of industry is connected with the great naval and military establishments, which employ large numbers of skilled artisans. Fishing and seafaring complete the list of occupations. The towns of the South-Eastern counties owe much of their pros perity to the proximity of the capital. Croydon, Richmond, and Reigate are residential towns for those whose callings connect them with London. Brighton is the most accessible watering place on the English Channel for Londoners, and may almost be regarded as a maritime suburb of the metropolis. Eastbourne, Hastings, and Worthing on the coast of Sussex ; Margate and Ramsgate on that of Kent ; and Bournemouth in Hampshire, are also favourite seaside water ing places. Gravesend is visited by thousands of holiday-makers, mostly of the humbler class. The chalybeate springs at Tunbridge Wells are much frequented. Dover and Folkestone are packet-stations for crossing to France and Belgium : Southampton is the great station for the Oriental, Mediterranean, and West Indian packets ; it is also the chief port of communication with the Channel Islands. Ports mouth, Chatham, and Sheerness are the seats of government establish ments : the first as the most important naval station in the realm ; the second as both a military and naval station, with a dockyard, arsenal, &c. ; and the third as having a large fortified dockyard. Dartford and Faversham have extensive powder -manufactories in their neighbourhood. Canterbury, Rochester, Chichester, and Win chester are Cathedral towns, the first being the metropolitan see. The Cinque-ports on the coasts of Kent and Sussex were originally 5 in number, as implied in the name ; these were Dover, Sandwich, Romney, Hythe, and Hastings ; to these were added Win chelsea and Rye as early as the reign of Henry III. ; while Seaford, though included under Hastings, is sometimes regarded as an eighth town.

Ides of Wight, Thanet, and Sheppey .- \u2014 The first of these two islands is included in Hampshire, the two last in Kent. The Isle of Wight is of a lozenge shape, having a length from E. to W. of 23 m., a breadth of 14 m., and an area of about 155 sq. m. A range of high ground tra verses it in the direction of its length from Culver Cliff in the E. to the Needles in the W. The chief slope ofthe island is towards the N., and in this direction flows the Medina. The climate ia mild, particularly on the S. coast, and the island is hence the resort of valetudinarians : its position further adapts it for yachting pursuits, and from these combined causes it enjoys a high prosperity. In a military point of view the island is important as commanding the approaches to Portsmouth : it is defended by fortifications of modern erection. Thanet is separated from the rest of Kent by the channels of the Stour which flow in two directions N. and S.E. ; but these are now so narrow that Thanet is more a peninsula than an island : formerly the channels were much broader (see cap. 3, \u00a7 2). The area of the district is about 40 sq. m. Sheppey is divided from the mainland by the Swale, an arm of the Medway : it contains about 33 sq. m. ; it is flat towards Kent, but rises into cliffs on its sea front. III.

South-Western Counties. \u2014 These counties vary much in their products and in the occupations of their inhabitants : Wiltshire is mainly agricultural (pastoral and dairy), but the towns in the western part of it are largely engaged in cloth-making. Dorset is also agricultural, the only mineral productions being the fine oolitic Portland stone, Purbeck marble, and potters' clay, which last is also found on the so-called Isle of Purbeck. Devon is both mining and agricultural : in its W. portion are situated some of the most valuable mines in England : its orchards are celebrated : lace-making is carried on at Honiton and Tavistock. Cornwall is pre-eminently a mining county. Somersetshire possesses some minerals, viz. : iron, lead, and a small coalfield, but its chief resources are in agriculture. Valuable fisheries (pilchard and herring) exist off the coasts of Cornwall. The towns are few as compared with the area of the South-Western Counties. Plymouth, with its suburbs, owes its large population to the naval establishments (dockyards, victualling-yards, and arsenal) located there. Falmouth is much frequented by vessels first reaching the shores of Britain, for orders or repairs. Numerous watering places occur, particularly on the S. coast : Torquay stands foremost in this respect on account of the mildness of its climate: Penzance is also frequented on the same ground ; and we may further notice, under this class of towns, Weymouth in Dorset ; Sidmouth, Exmouth, Dawlish, and Teignmouth, in S. Devon ; Hfracombe in N. Devon ; and Weston-super-Mare in Somerset. Salisbury, Wells, and Exeter are cathedral towns, and the last is also an important county-town. Bath is much frequented as a residential town, though it does not hold so high a position as it once did as a fashion able resort.

Eastern Counties. \u2014 These counties are almost entirely agricultural ; a large amount of wheat is grown in them, and Nor folk is famed for its barley. The manufactures are restricted to bombasines and crape at Norwich, silks at Colchester and Halstead, and satin at the latter place. Fishing gives occupation in the coast towns, especially at Yarmouth. The towns call for little notice. Norwich is a cathedral-town, and may be regarded as the capital of East Anglia. Ipswich is a thriving place, engaged in the corn-trade and in sundry manufactures. Yarmouth is the headquarters of the herring-fishery. Harwich is a rising port, well situated for Dutch traffic. Lowestoft and King's Lynn, on the Wash, are ports. Colchester is now an important military station.

Of the minor manufactures carried on we may notice \u2014 strawplaiting in Herts (Dunstable, &c), and at Aylesbury in Bucks ; shoemaking on a large scale at Northampton ; iron-making (an increasing busi ness) at Wellingborough ; malting in Herts (Ware, &c.) ; lacemaking in parts of Bucks and Oxfordshire ; blankets at Witney, and gloves at Woodstock. The towns are neither numerous nor large: yet they contain much that is interesting both in an architectural and historical point of view. The ancient University-towns of Oxford and Cambridge have a world-wide fame both for their buildings and their associations : the first is also an episcopal see. Ely has a mag nificent cathedral, and is historically famous. Northampton stands first in population, chiefly owing to its shoe-manufacture. Peter borough is a cathedral-town, and Eton is the seat of the most famous school in the kingdom. Wisbeach on the Nen is a small port.

Rutland and Leicester are grazing counties : the renowned Stilton cheese is produced in the district where they meet, and the large long-woolled sheep of Leicester are well known : in the latter county a large manufacture of hosiery is carried on. Derby is a mineral and manufacturing county with a coalfield and iron-ore on its E. side giving rise to an increasing manufacture of iron about Chesterfield, and with special manufactures of silk at Derby, and cotton at Glossop in the extreme N. Nottinghamshire is chiefly known for its manufactures of laee and hosiery. The towns of the North-Midland Counties do not call for much notice. Nottingham, Leicester, and Derby are large and thriving places, the two first depending chiefly on the staple manufactures of their counties, and the last having silk-mills and iron-foundries. The other manufacturing towns are Loughborough (hosiery), Belper (cotton), and Mansfield (lace). Lin ooln is an episcopal see, and has a large local trade. Grimsbv and Boston are the chief ports in Lincolnshire, and carry on commerce with the North of Europe : Grimsby owes its importance to the docks commenced in 1849 in connexion with the railway to Man chester : Boston is situated on the Witham, and is accessible to vessels of 300 tons. Matlock and Buxton have mineral springs, thoss at the latter place being particularly efficacious for rheumatic affec tions. Melton Mowbray is the headquarters of the hunting commu nity, and Wirksworth is looked upon as the mining capital of Derby shire. g 2"], [140, "Book I. 124 ENGLAND AND WALES.

NORTH-WESTERN COUNTIES. 125 \u00a78. North-Western Counties. \u2014 Cheshire is famous as an agricultural county : both its soil and climate are favourable to pas tures, and it stands high in respect to its dairy produce. In Lan cashire the agricultural interest holds a subordinate place : the soil is productive in the coast region, but the high grounds are covered with moors or peat mosses : oats form the principal cereal in this county. Manufactures and commerce are prosecuted in both counties, but more especially in Lancashire. Cheshire possesses the rising port of Birkenhead, where shipbuilding forms so important a business, while in the towns in the N.E. there are extensive manu factures of cotton and silk. Lancashire is pre-eminently the manu facturing county of England : though cotton is the staple product, there is hardly a textile fabric of any kind which does not issue from its looms ; while foundries and other accessory branches of trade give employment to a large number of people, as also do the collieries about Wigan. An immense amount of general commerce is carried on from its chief port, Liverpool. Many of the towns in these counties have a notoriety second only to that of London. This may be said more especially of Liverpool, the great commercial emporium of the North, and of Manchester, the manufacturing metropolis and an episcopal see. Birkenhead may be regarded as a suburb of Liver pool, though the breadth of the intervening river is such as to wholly break the continuity of the towns. Of the other towns, Preston, Bolton, Blackburn, Ashton-under-Lyne, and Chorley in Lancashire, are seats of cotton manufacture almost exclusively ; Macolesfield and Congleton, of silk ; Stookport, Wigan, and Burnley, of collieries, as well as of cotton manufacture ; Bury and Rochdale, of cotton and woollen ; Oldham, of cotton and machinery. Chester is an interest ing old town and an episcopal see. Northwich has brine springs, whence salt is obtained. Warrington, St. Helens, and Lanoaster have sundry manufactures. The latter town, together with Preston and Fleetwood, are seaports of limited capacity. Lytham, Blackpool, New Brighton, and Fleetwood, are watering-places, much frequented by the residents of the cotton district. Noteworthy Objects, &c. \u2014 Liverpool; its Docks, the first formed in 1709, and now extending for 5 m. along the river, with an area of above 245 acres : St. George's Hall, in the Corinthian style, with a central hall 161 ft. long: the Custom House, conspicuous from its dome: the Collegiate Institution : the Town-hall, &c.

The North and East Ridings have more especially the former character ; some parts of them yield good cereal crops, particularly Byedale in the Eastern Moors, Cleveland N. of the Moors, Holderness, and the warp-lands on the banks of the Humber. The greater part of the soil, however, is under pas ture, and Yorkshire has long been famous for its breed of horses, the Wolds and Moors offering great opportunities both for breeding and training. The West Riding is mainly adapted to grazing, a large proportion of the area being mere mountain-tops. The S.W. of this Riding is the great seat of the woollen and worsted manufactures, and the S., of iron, cutlery, and hardware. About Barnsley there are numerous collieries, and ironworks are located about the coal field in this part of the county. Flax is also largely worked in the same district. A large iron manufacture has sprung up about Middlesborough, in the extreme N. of the East Riding, and alum works occur about Whitby. The manufacture of jet ornaments is"], [143, "Chap. IV. YORKSHIRE. 127 no inconsiderable resource in the sea-coast towns of Whitby and Scarborough, while fishing for cod and lobster furnish occupation to these and other coast towns. The towns are very unequally dispersed over the three Ridings. The North Biding possesses not a single town with a population over 20,000, and but three with one over 10,000. The East Biding has only one first-class town. The West Riding, on the other hand, has a cluster of bustling and populous towns in the western and southern districts. Of these, Leeds stands first in importance with its extensive manufactures of woollen, silk, and linen stuffs, machinery and tools, leather and glass. Sheffield stands next in point of population, and holds the first place in steel and metal working. The other great towns, though all engaged in the woollen trade, have each its special de partment, Bradford being pre-eminently devoted to worsted spinning, Halifax to fine textures, Huddersfield to narrow cloths and fancy goods, Saddleworth to kerseymeres and broadcloths, and Dewsbury to blankets, shoddy, &c. Barnsley has various manufactures, of which linen is the chief. Keighley has both woollen and worsted manufactories. Wakefield is more famous as a mart of agricultural produce (corn and wool) than as a manufacturing town : yarn is still, however, produced there. Doncaster is a purely agricultural town, but derives its chief notoriety from its horse-races. York, the county-town, and Ripon are episcopal sees, and the former has a large general trade, and a few minor manufactures. Hull, or, as it is more fully named, Kingston-on-Hull, ranks among the chief com mercial ports of Great Britain, being the outlet for the large trade of Yorkshire, and being also conveniently situated for communica tion with the North of Europe. The other ports on the coast are Bridlington, Scarborough, and Whitby, but these are better known as watering-places, Scarborough having a special fame in this respect.

Northern Counties. \u2014 Durham and Northumberland are essentially mining and manufacturing counties. The sea-borne coal is shipped for London and the E. and S. coasts of England from the ports of these two counties. There are large iron-works also about the Tees and the Tyne, and the banks of the latter river below New castle are a busy scene of chemical, glass, and sundry manufactures, besides shipbuilding. Cumberland also possesses a coalfield, with deposits of iron ore and other minerals. Farming is carried on successfully in the valleys and maritime plains of these counties: the highlands are adapted for sheepfeeding alone : the Durham breed of cows, and the sheep of the Cheviot hills are well known. The large towns on the N.E. coast owe their prosperity to the extent of the coalfield and its proximity to the sea. Most of them are ports employed in shipping coal, and some add manufactures or ship building to the export trade. The Tyne ports, Newcastle, Tynemouth or North Shields, and South Shields, combine a vast commerce in"], [145, "Chap. IV. 129 NORTHERN COUNTIES. shipping coal with various manufactures. Sunderland carries on shipbuilding and holds the second place as a coalshipping port. Hartlepool and Stockton are also active coal-ports, and Berwick-on- Tweed has a general local business as a port. Durham and Carlisle are episcopal sees, and the former is also the seat of a University. Carlisle, Penrith and Kendal have various textile manufactures. At Whitehaven coal is shipped for Scotland and Ireland.

(up to which time it had been regarded as part of the \" March \"), is yet so intimately connected with Wales by position and population, that we have added it to this division. As large portions of the Welsh counties are wild unenclosed mountain-tops, pasturage forms the chief feature in the agriculture of the country : sheep, black cattle, and ponies are reared in great numbers. Of cereals, barley and oats are cultivated more than wheat. Mining is much followed ; in the coalfields for coal and iron, in Cardiganshire and elsewhere for lead, and in Carnarvonshire and Merionethshire for slate. The manufacture of iron is carried on to a great extent in the South Wales coal district, and copper is brought to Swansea and Llanelly to be smelted. The only texture produced in Wales is flannel, which is manufactured in Montgomery shire. A large amount of shipping is employed in connexion with the coal, iron, and copper-smelting business. The towns call for little notice. The most populous places are situated on and about the South Wales coalfield ; Merthyr Tydvil may be regarded as the metropolis of the iron district ; Cardiff and Newport as its chief ports, while Swansea and Llanelly combine coal-shipping with copper smelting. The episcopal sees of St. David's, Llandaff, and St. Asaph, are little else than villages; Bangor, from its position and its prox imity to the slate quarries, is a larger place. The most frequented watering places are Rhyl and Llandudno on the N. coast, Aberystwith on the W. coast, and Tenby on the S. coast. Mineral waters of local repute exist at Builth and the neighbouring villages of Llandrindod and Llanwrtyd ; their inaccessibility has hitherto operated as a bar to their general use. Pembroke is the seat of a naval dockyard; Milford and Holyhead are packet-stations for Ireland; Milford for"], [147, "Chap. IV. WALES. 131 the S., Holyhead for the main route between London and Dublin. Conway is noticeable as being still surrounded by the walls erected by Edward I. Noteworthy Objects, &c. \u2014 The edifices of Wales belong rather to tbe past than the present. St. David's Cathedral is the finest ecclesiastical edifice ; Llandaff comes next ; both have suffered much from past neglect. Brecon Prioi-y Church is worthy of mention. There are. a few fine engineering works, of which we may notice \u2014 the Menai Sus pension Bridge, erected by Telford in order to facilitate the transit to Ireland ; the Britannia Tubular Bridge, across the same strait, earry- 38. The Menai Suspension Bridge, with Snowdon in the distance ing the Chester and Holyhead railway, Stephenson's greatest achieve ment ; Conway Tubular Bridge, on a smaller scale ; and the Crumlin Viaduct near Pontypool, in Monmouthshire, a light and elegant iron structure crossing a deep valley. These counties abound in ruined castles, the positions of which are so striking as to give additional interest to them. The largest are Raglan, in Monmouthshire ; Chep- Btow, overhanging the Wye in the same county ; Carnarvon, aud Conway, both iu a fine state of preservation ; Harlech, imposingly situated on a rock overlooking the sea; and Pembroke, on a rocky pro montory washed by a creek of Milford Haven. Of ecclesiastical ruins we may notice Tintern Abbey on the Wye, near Chepstow. Historical Associations. \u2014 Monmouth. the birthplace ot Henry V.

Boundaries \u2014 Shape \u2014 Size \u2014 Population. \u2014 The northern division of Great Britain is named Scotland, and occasionally North Britain. It is bounded N. and W. by the Atlantic, E. by the North Sea, and S. by the Solway Firth, the Cheviots, and the Lower Tweed. These latter form the boundary on the side of England: from Ireland it is separated by tbe North Channel, which connects the Irish Sea with the Atlantic. Some im- portant groups of islands lie adjacent to, and are politically incor porated with the mainland, viz. : the Orkneys and the Shetlands off the N. coast, and the Hebrides or Western Isles off the W. coast. The Orkneys are separated from the mainland by the Pentland Firth ; the Outer Hebrides by the Minch ; and the Inner Hebrides by a series of inclosed channels, of which we may here notice : \u2014 On the side of Skye, North Sound, Loch Alsh, Glenelg Bay, and Sleat Sound ; on the side of Mull, the Sound of Mull and the Firth of Lorn ; more S."], [150, "Book I. 134 SCOTLAND. the Sound of Jura; Kilbrennan Sound between Arran and Cantyre; and the tortuous channel known as the Kyles of Bute between Bute and the mainland. ' The outline of Scotland is so irregular that it cannot be compared with any normal figure. The most marked fea tures are : \u2014 (1) the large easterly protrusion between the Firths of Tay and Moray ; (2) the northern peninsula, which also has an easterly protrusion ; (3) the long tongue of land, known as the peninsula of Cantire, which projects from the W. coast into the North Channel; and (4) the peninsular protrusion in the S.W. between the Solway Firth and the Firth of Clyde. The length of Scotland from N. to S. is about 275 m. ; the breadth varies, but nowhere exceeds 150 m. along a parallel of latitude. The extreme points are : \u2014 N., Dunnet Head, 58\u00b0 40\" N. lat. ; S., the Mull of Galloway, 54\u00b0 38' N. lat. ; E., Buchanness, 1\u00b0 46' W. long. ; and W., Ardnamurchan Point, 6\u00b0 14' W. long. The area of the mainland is estimated at 26,014 sq. m. ; and of the islands at 4,671 sq. m. The population (islands included) amounted in 1861 to 3,062,294. \u00a7 2. Coasts. \u2014 The west coast of Scotland is remarkably irregular, being fretted with inlets throughout nearly its whole length. The east coast contains fewer, but still considerable indentations. The total length of coast-line is estimated at 2506 m., which gives the extraordinary proportion of 1 m. of coast for each 10J sq. m. of area. The most important inlets are those which supply links of communi cation between the E. and W. coasts, viz. : the Firths of Forth and of Clyde, which approximate each other in the lowland district ; and the more northerly Moray Firth and Loch Linnhe, between which a chain of lakes crosses diagonally, forming the line of the Caledonian Canal. On the W. coast Looh Fyne penetrates N. from the Firth of Clyde in the direction of the Sound of Jura, and supplies, with the Crinan Canal, a direct passage from Glasgow to the Hebrides. We may further notice three considerable inlets on the E. coast, viz. : \u2014 the Firth of Tay, which receives the river of the same name ; Cro marty Firth, a land-locked sheet of water connected by a narrow strait with Moray Firth; and Dornoch Firth, immediately N. of Cromarty Firth. The most prominent headlands are :\u2014 St. Abb's Head, on the S.E. coast ; Fife Ness, between the Firths of Forth and Tay ; Kinnaird Head, at the N.E. angle of Aberdeensbire ; Tarbet Ness, between Dornoch and Moray Firths ; Duncansby Head, at the N.E. angle of Scotland ; Dunnet Head, at the W. entrance of Pent land Firth ; Cape Wrath, at the N.W. angle ; Rn Rea, on the W. coast, in Ross-shire ; Ardnamurchan Point, in Argyllshire, already no ticed as the most westerly point of Scotland ; the Mull of Cantire, which terminates the peninsula of that name ; and the Mull of Gal loway, at the S.W. angle of Scotland. The coasts are generally bold and rocky, the chief exceptions being the portions between St. Abb's"], [151, "135 Cnir. V. COASTS AND HARBOURS. Head and the Firth of Tay ; between Burgh Head and the Ord of Caithness : along the Ayrshire coast as far S. as Girvan ; and about the head of the Solway Firth. A more complete survey of the coast would include the following inlets and promontories. On the E. coast: \u2014 Buchan Ness, iu Aber deenshire, the most easterly point of Scotland ; Rattray Head, in the same county ; Burgh Head, at the S. entrance of Moray Firth ; Beauley Firth, a continuation of Moray Firth; the Ord of Caithness, Noss Head, and Sinclair Bay. On the N. coast : \u2014 Dunnet Bay, W. of Dunuet Head; Kyle of Tongue, Loch Eribol, and Kyle of Durness, three fiords penetrating inland between the ranges of Sutherlandshire. On the W. coast: \u2014 Loch Laxford; Kyle Sku; the headland of Ru Storr; Loch Enard; the headland of Ru More; Loch Broom, an elongated bay run ning S.E. ; Loch Greinord; Loch Ewe; Loch Torridon, at the N. ex tremity of North Sound; Loch Carron; Loch Duich, connected with Loch Alsh ; Lochs Hourn and Nevish, in Sleat Sound ; Lochs Eil and Leven, branches of Loch Linnhe ; Loch Etive ; Loch Long, a branch of the Firth of Clyde ; and Loch Ryan, near the S.W. extremity of Scot land. On the S. coast : \u2014 Luce Bay, a broad arm of the sea E. of the Mull of Galloway ; Burrow Head, bounding Luce Bay on the E. ; and Wigton Bay, E. of Burrow Head. Changes of elevation in the land. \u2014 That changes in the level have occurred within the period of man's existence, appears from the disco very of boats, anchors, &c, in spots far removed from the sea and at considerable elevations above it. For instance, the skeletons of whales with harpoons have been found at Airthrey, near the Forth, 22 ft. above high-water mark, and a mile from the river ; and, again, at Blair Drummond, 7 m. further inland : canoes have been found near Falkirk, on the site of Glasgow, at Lochar Moss in Dumfriesshire, and in other places. These relics of a primeval population are found at great depths below the present level of the soil. Again, the remains of the Roman port of Alaterva are 20 ft. above the sea-level, and there is reason to suppose that in the Roman period the sea washed the base of Chapel Bill where the Wall of Antonine terminates, though this is now 25 ft. above the sea-level. \u00a7 3. Harbours. \u2014 Scotland is not so well supplied with harbours as the number of its inlets would lead us to anticipate. South of the Firth of Forth, the only harbour is that of Dunbar, the approach to which is dangerous. The Firth of Forth supplies anchorage in many parts, but has no good natural harboui : Leith is deficient in water, and Granton is an artificial port : Burntisland and Kirkcaldy on tbe Fife coast are accessible at high water, and vessels of 300 tons reach Alloa. The Firth of Tay is navigable for vessels of 500 tons up to Dnndee, and for vessels of 100 tons to Perth; but the navigation is impeded by sandbanks and strong tides ; Dundee harbour itself is ar tificial. Higher up the east coast, the harbours-of Montrose, Aberdeen, Stonehaven, and Peterhead, are dangerous of access in rough weather, ind have required the addition of piers and other works to make them serviceable. From Kinnaird Head to Moray Firth there are inly tidal harbours. In the Moray Firth ships of burden can pene-"], [152, "SCOTLAND. Book I. 136 trate beyond Inverness into Loch Beauley, and the Caledonian Cana\". is navigable for vessels drawing 15 ft. of water. The Firth of Cro marty is a splendid harbour, but too secluded to be of much use. The frequented port of Wick has needed, as others on this coast, engineering skill to render it available. The Pentland Firth is dangerous \"to navigate in consequence of the violent currents in it, and'the harbour of Thurso, though a fair one, is little frequented. On the W. coast we pass by the numerous fiords in the northern division as being too remote to be available until we reach Loch Linnhe, the southern entrance to the Caledonian Canal. The Firth of Clyde has deep water throughout, and is accessible for vessels of all sizes : its finest harbour is Lamlash Bay on Arran, a land-locked and spacious sheet of water : the Clyde itself has been made navi gable for sea-going ships up to Glasgow, but the channel is very liable to silting : Greenook serves as the chief port of Glasgow. On the Ayrshire coast the harbours of Ardrossan, Troon and Ayr have no great capacity, and the last is poor. Loch Ryan is sheltered and deep, and vessels of 300 tons reach Stranraer. The coast thence to the Mull of Galloway is dangerous, and contains only a single harbour, Port Patriok, of small capacity, but adapted by its position for traffic with Ireland. The S. coast of Galloway offers harbourage at the Isle of Whithorn and Kirkcudbright Bay. \u00a7 4. Mountains. \u2014 Scotland is popularly divided into the \" High lands\" and \"Lowlands;\" the former embracing all that lies N. ofa line drawn from the Firth of Clyde on the W. coast to Aberdeen on the E. coast. The terms are not wholly applicable to the divisions : there are some maritime plains in the northern or \" Highland \" portion, and the \" Lowlands \" include a mountainous region in the S., which has no resemblance to a lowland. The Highlands them selves are divided into two parts by the vale of Glenmore, which crosses diagonally between the Moray Firth and Loch Linnhe. Scot land may thus be said to consist of four distinct regions : \u2014 (1) The Benmore region of the Highlands, N. of the Glenmore. (2) The Grampian region of the Highlands, between the Glenmore and the Strathmore. (3) The Lowland plain of the Clyde and Forth; and (4) The southern or Cheviot mountainous region of the Low lands. The general direction of the Highland ranges is well exhi bited in the parallel lines of the two \" great vales,\" the Glenmore and the Strathmore, which cross the country diagonally from N.E. to S.W. We proceed to describe the three mountain regions above referred to. 1 . In the northern division, the line of greatest elevation approxi mates to the W. coast, skirting the heads of the various lochs. The bulk of the country E. of this is a rugged tableland traversed at ii.tervals by lateral chains in the direction of the North Sea. The"], [153, "137 Chap. V. MOUNTAINS AND PLAINS. highest points in the western ridge are : \u2014 Ben Attow (4000 ft.), near the Sound of Sleat; Ben Dearg (3551 ft.), near Loch Broom; and Ben More (3235 ft.), near the Kyle of Assynt. Eastward of the range are Ben Wyvis (3122 ft.), near the Cromarty Firth; and Ben Clibrick (3157 ft.), more to the N. 2. The Grampian region contains the following ranges from N. to S.: \u2014 (1) The Monagh Leagh range, between the valleys ofthe Spey and the Findhorn. (2) The Cairn Gorni or Northern Grampians, occupying the triangular space between the converging streams of the Spey and the Dee, and culminating in Ben Macdui (4295 ft.). (3) The Central Grampians, S. of the Dee on the E. coast, and of the Spean on the W. coast, the culminating points being Ben Nevis (4368 ft.), the highest mountain in Great Britain, at the head of Loch Eil ; Loch-na-gar (3777 ft.), near the Dee ; and Ben-y-gloe (3724 ft.), near Blair Athol. (4) The Southern Grampians, extending from the upper part of the basin of the Tay southward to the Clyde, and including the well-known heights of Ben More (3835 ft.), and Ben Lawers (3984 ft.), both of them near the head of the Tay ; Ben Cruachan (3670 ft.), near the head of Loch Awe; and Ben Lomond (3192 ft.), near Loch Lomond. 3. The Cheviot region is bounded N. by the Tweed and tho Upper Clyde, and covers an extensive district extending E. and W., with a series of irregular ranges; the most important being the Cheviots on the borders of Northumberland, and the Lowther Hills, about tbe sources of the rivers Clyde, Tweed, and Annan. The highest points in the latter are Broad Law (2741 ft.), near the source of the Tweed; and the Lowthers (3100 ft.) in the vale of the Nith. In the W., the ranges ramify to the sea-coast in the direction of Loch Ryan and Wigton Bay, and near the latter is an important height named Cairnsmoor (2329 ft.). Some ranges of inferior height skirt the border of the central low land, viz. : on the N. the Campsie Hills, between the Clyde and the Forth ; the Ochill Mountains, between the Forth and the Tay ; and the Sidlaw Hills, between the Tay and the Esk : on the S. the Haug shaw Hills, between the Avon and the Clyde ; the Pentland Hills, near the Firth of Forth; and the Lammermuir Hills, S. of the Tyne. \u00a7 5. Plains. \u2014 The most extended plain in Scotland is that between the Grampians and the Lowther Hills, of which the Plain of the Clyde and Forth forms the central and lowest portion, beiug but little elevated above the level of the sea. N. of this plain, and sepa rated from it by the Campsie and Ochill Hills, is the Strathmore, which exteuds uninterruptedly from the Campsie Hills to the sea in Kincardineshire, a distance of nearly 100 m., and with a breadth varying from 5 to 10 m. The Carse of Gowrie is another portion of the plain, lying between the Sidlaw Hills and the Tay. Along the W. coast the lowland is prolonged in the Plain of Ayr. In addition to these, a stretch of lowland fringes the E. coast from the mouth of the Dee northwards, expanding in width until it comprises the whole N.E. angle of Aberdeenshire as far as the river Deveran. A belt of lowland, again, fringes the Moray Firth, while in the extreme N.E. the Plain of Caithness occupies the greater part of that county. In the extreme S., that portion of Wigton which lies S. of a line"], [154, "138 SCOTLAND. Book I, between the heads of Wigton and Luce bays is a plain, as also is a broad belt along the Solway Firth from the mouth of the Nith eastward. The Merse of Berwickshire is a detached plain bounded S. by the Tweed between Berwick and Coldstream, and N. by the Lammermuir range. \u00a7 6. Rivers. \u2014 The rivers of Scotland may be arranged under the two heads of Highland and Lowland, including under the former those that rise in the Grampian region, and under the latter those that rise in the Cheviot region. The main lines of watershed in these two divi sions run in opposite directions : in the Highlands from N. to S., in close proximity to the western coast, so as to throw off the important rivers, viz., the Forth, the Tay, the Dee, the Don, and the Spey, to wards the North Sea : in the Lowlands from B. to W., or more exactly from N.E. to S.W., so that the two chief rivers in this region, viz., the Clyde and the Tweed, seek the sea by circuitous routes in opposite directions, while others, as the Annan and the Nith, have general southerly courses. With the exception of the Clyde, no river of any importance reaches the Atlantic. The Scotch rivers are impetuous, and consequently unfavourable to navigation. The following table exhibits the lengths and the basin-areas of these rivers, exclusive of their estuaries : \u2014 The Tay is the largest river in Scotland, and is said to exceed in volume any of the English rivers : it rises near the head of Loch Lo mond, traverses Loch Tay, receives on its left bank the Lyon, and lower down the Tumel, which drains the extensive region of Rannoch Moor and receives the Garry from the Central Grampians : below Dunkeld the Tay is diverted to the S.W. by the Sidlaw Hills, and reaches the sea in the opening between these and the Ochill Hills, receiving below Perth on its rt. bank tbe Earn from Loch Earn. The Forth rises on Ben Lomond and holds an easterly course across the Strathmore and between the Ochill and Campsie Hills to its estuary, receiving near Stirling the Teith from Loch Katrine on its left bank. In its lower course it winds about, and forms the fertile peninsulas known as \" the Links of Forth.\" The Tweed rises in the S.W. angle of Peeblesshire, flows N.E. to Peebles, and subsequently S.E. to Melrose, and N.E. to the sea, re ceiving on its rt. bank the Ettrick with the Yarrow, and the Teviot; and on its left bank the Gala (of Galashiels1,, the Lauder from the Lam mermuir Hills, and the Adder from the same quarter. The Tweed is not navigable above Berwick, but its fisheries are very valuable. Length in m. Basin- area in sq. m. River. Length in m. Basin- area iu sq. m. Eiver. Tay ... . Forth . . . .

RIVERS AND LAKES. 139 The Clyde rises very near the Tweed, and flows N. and N.W. ; it receives the Douglas on its left bank above Lanark, and descends rapidly to the plain by a series of falls extending over 6 in., one of these (Cora Linn) having a height of 84 ft. It subsequently receives on its left bank the Avon and the Cart, and on its rt. the Medwin, the two Calders, and the Kelvin. The Spey is the most important river in the northern part of the Grampian region : it rises near Loch Lochy, and pursues a nearly direct N.E. course to the sea, increasing in rapidity as it progresses, so as to become the most violent and destructive stream in Scotland : it affords valuable fisheries. **\u2022 Loch Katrine. \u00a7 7. Lakes. \u2014 Scotland is pre-eminently the land of Lakes. Not only is their number extraordinary, but their picturesque beauty is equally so. Long, narrow, and winding, with crag and wood over hanging their shores, they offer an amount of water scenery such as no other country possesses in a like degree. Among the more re markable we may notice (with the length of each in miles appended in brackets) :\u2014 Loch Lomond (24), studded with wooded islets, dis charging its surplus waters by the Leven into the Clyde; Loch Katrine (9), the upper reservoir of the Teith, which thence flows through the picturesque gorge of the Trossachs, the scene of Sir W. Scott's poem ' The Lady of the Lake ;' Loch Tay (14), on the course of the river of the same name ; Lochs Ericht (14), Rannoch (8), and Lydoch (10), whose waters pass by the Tumel into the Tay; Loch Awe (23), connected by a river of the same name with Loch Etive : the Lochs in the long valley of Glenmore, on the line of the Cale donian Canal, viz. :\u2014 Lochy (9), Oich (5), and Ness (22) ; Looh Maree (12J), in the Benmore district, which discharges its waters by the"], [156, "140 SCOTLAND. Book I, Ewe into Loch Ewe ; and Loch Leven (4), the largest of the Lowlatd lakes, in the county of Fife, with an island on it where Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned. The lakes are generally deep, Loch Ness attaining to 800 ft. \u00a7 8. Minerals \u2014 Mineral Springs. \u2014 The mineral resources of Scotland consist mainly of coal and iron. The coal-measures occupy an area of 2200 sq. m. The most extensive field is that which crosses from sea to sea between Ayr in the W. and St. Andrew's in the E., with a length of nearly 100 m. and a breadth of 33 m., the most valuable portions of it being situated about the banks of the Forth and the Clyde. Detached fields occur in Ayrshire about Dalmellington, and in the high ground about the upper courses of the Nith, the Ayr, and the Douglas. Iron is found contiguous to coal throughout the fields. Lead is extracted at Leadhills, on the borders of Dumfries and Lanark ; antimony at Langholm, in Dumfriesshire; slate in the counties of Aberdeen, Argyll, Perth, and Peebles ; fine granite in Aberdeenshire, and elsewhere in the Grampian district ; and marble in Sutherland, Argyll, and the Hebrides. Mineral Springs. \u2014 The most valued mineral springs in Scotland are situated at the following places : \u2014 Moffat, in Dumfriesshire (sulphu reous); Bridge of Allan, near Stirling (saline); and Cowgask, nearCrieS (saline). There are saline springs also at Pitcaithley, near Perth, and at Inverleithen, near Peebles ; and sulphureous springs at Stratbpeffer and Muirtown, near Dingwall in Ross-shire ; and at Corstorphine, near Edinburgh. \u00a7 9. Population \u2014 Manufactures \u2014 Agriculture \u2014 Fisheries- Religion \u2014 Education. \u2014 The population of Scotland has not pro gressed so rapidly as that of England, but its increase has never theless been very marked. In tbe present century it has advanced from 1,608,420 to 3,062,294, having nearly doubled itself in that period. The increase is most decided in the manufacturing and com mercial districts ; Ayrshire having advanced from 84,207 to 198,971 ; Renfrewshire from 78,501 to 177,561 ; Lanarkshire from 147,692 to 631,566; and Edinburghshire from 122,597 to 273,997. On the other hand, Sutherland has only advanced from 23,117 to 23,246, while Argyllshire has actually decreased from 81,277 to 79,724. The rise of Glasgow has been extraordinary : in 1801 it numbered only 83,700 inhabitants, and now, with its suburbs, it numbers 446,395. The density of the population varies from 13 per sq. m. in Sutherland to 746 in Edinburghshire, the mean rate being 100 per sq. m. The bulk of the population is engaged in manufactures : agriculture, chiefly pastoral, holds the second place : and seafaring pursuits, witb fishing, occupy a large number of persons. The number of persons engaged in manufactures (in 1861) was 694,074, and in agriculture 378,609."], [157, "Chap. V. POPULATION, MANUFACTURES, ETC. 141 Manufactures. \u2014 The contiguity of coal and iron has conduced to develop a large manufacture of iron in the Plain of the Forth and Clyde. The amount at present produced is about one-third of the produce of England aud Wales. Iron ship-building is a prominent branch of in dustry on the banks of the Clyde, and a large number of steam-engines and other machines are made up there. Cotton is largely manufactured at Glasgow, Paisley, and neighbouring places : woollen goods at Hawick, Galashiels, Kilmarnock (carpets and shawls), Paisley, Stirling (tartans), and Aberdeen : and silk at Paisley and Glasgow. The linen trade is seated at and about Dundee on the E. coast, probably from the con venient position of that locality relatively to the flax -producing countries of Northern Europe. Whiskey distilling is another important branch of industry. Agriculture. \u2014 Though the amount of cultivable soil in Scotland is small and the climate unfavourable, immense progress has been made in agriculture, and the Scotch Lowland farms are regarded as models of good husbandry. The richest soil, and consequently the most pro fitable farming is found in the following districts : \u2014 the Merse of Ber wickshire, between the Lammermuir Hills and the Tweed; the Carses of Falkirk and Stirling, on the banks of the Forth; the Howe of Fife, in the valley of the Eden ; the Carse of Gowrie, between the Sidlaw Hills and the Firth of Tay ; the Howe of Angus in the valley of Strath more between the Grampians and the Sidlaw Hills, in Forfarshire ; the Howe of the Mearns, a continuation of the above in Kincardineshire ; and the coast district about the Moray and Cromarty Firths. Sheep farming is extensively pursued in the Highlands, and has superseded in several counties the rearing of cattle. Ayrshire and Renfrewshire stand high in respect to dairy produce. Fisheries. \u2014 In addition to the valuable salmon fisheries on the Tweed, the Spey, and other rivers, we may notice the herring-fishery as of great importance, and prosecuted all round the coasts, but especially in Loch Fyne, and from the ports of Dunbar and Wick. Ling, cod, and haddock, are the other fish caught. Whaling is largely prosecuted from Peterhead, Dundee, and Aberdeen. Religion. \u2014 The established form of religion in Scotland is the Pres byterian, the supreme governing body of which is the General Assembly, consisting of 368 members, partly laymen, but chiefly ministers, elected by the local presbyteries, the royal burghs, and the Universities. The ecclesiastical divisions are \u2014 (1) Parishes, of which there are 1023, each with its minister, and a judicatory named the Kirk Session, consisting of the minister and certain lay-elders. (2) Presbyteries, of which there are 80, consisting of several parishes, the number varying from 34 to 6 ; the Presbytery is a court of judicature formed of the ministers and a lay-elder from each parish. (3) Synods, of which there are 1 6, com posed of from 2 to 8 presbyteries. A serious disruption of the Presby terian Church took place in 1 843, on a question of Government patronage, resulting in the establishment of the Free Church. The Established and the Free Churches have each about a third of the population, while the remaining third is divided between the United Presbyterian, the Episcopalian, and the Roman Catholic Churches. The Episcopalian Church is under 7 bishops, several of the old dioceses (of which there were 12) having been combined, while one, Caithness, is no longer represented. The Roman Catholic Church is prevalent in the He brides, and in the counties of Aberdeen and Banff. Education. \u2014 Scotland possesses four Universities, viz.: \u2014 St. Andrew's,"], [158, "142 SCOTLAND. Book I. founded in 1411; Glasgow, in 1450; Aberdeen, in 1494; and Edin burgh, in 1581. The endowments are on a restricted scale. The total number of students is between 2500 and 3000, the majority of whom belong to the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. Of schools for the upper classes we may notice the High School of Edinburgh as standing first. \u00a7 10. Political Divisions. \u2014 Scotland is divided into 33 counties, the names and towns of which are given in the subjoined tables. Ross and Cromarty are regarded as one for parliamentary and judi cial purposes ; Cromarty consists of ten distinct pieces of land, nine of which are surrounded by Ross, while the tenth is on the penin sula S. of Cromarty Firth known as the Black Isle, their whole area amounting to only 17J sq. m. It will be observed that, with the exception of the Orkneys and Shetlands, which together form a county, and Bute and Arran, which are combined under the former name, the other islands are included in the counties of the main land : thus the Outer Hebrides are divided between Ross and Inver ness ; and the Inner Hebrides between Inverness and Argyll. The names of the counties are for the most part derived from the chief towns in each : the exceptions to this are Fife, Argyll, Sutherland (t. e. the \" Southern \" land in reference to the advance of Norwegian sway through the Shetlands and Orkneys), and Caithness. Rox burgh derives its name from its former capital, which was once the fourth town in Scotland ; and Berwick is named after Berwick-on- Tweed, which is now outside its boundary. The maritime counties are generally separated from each other by rivers or firths. A variety of ancient names for districts are still current, as the Lothians, com prising Linlithgow, Edinburgh, and Haddington, which are distin guished respectively as the West, Mid, and East Lothians ; Galloway, comprising Kirkcudbright and Wigton ; Buchan, the N.E. angle of Aberdeen ; Breadalbane, in Perth ; Gowrie, in Perth and Forfar, &c. The division into counties appeal's to have been a gradual process in Scotland as in England. The institution of sheriffdoms can be traced back at all events to the time of David I. in the 12th cent. In 1305 we find as many as 25 sheriffdoms enumerated. Caithness, Suther land, and Ross, were not constituted independent counties until 1641. Galloway retained its local government as late as the 15th century. The counties are not subdivided into hundreds as in England, but in certain cases old subdivisions survive : Lanark, for instance, is divided into 3 wards, distinguished as the Over, Middle, and Nether Wards; Berwick into 3 districts \u2014 Merse, Lammermuir, and Lauderdale; Ayrshire into 3 bailiaries \u2014 Kyle, Carrick, and Cuninghame ; and Argyll into 4 dis tricts \u2014 Lorn, Argyll, Cowall, and Cantyre. The counties of Forfar, Perth, and Fife, were formerly divided into quarters. The subdivision into parishes is universal, and dates as far back at all events as to tlie 12th century. \u00a7 11. Towns \u2014 Antiquities \u2014 Communications. \u2014 The towns of Scotland do not hold the same prominent place in point of popv.la-"], [159, "Chap. V. POLITICAL DIVISIONS, TOWNS, ETC. 143 tion as those of England. Glasgow rises to nearly 450,000 ; from that we drop at once to 168,121, the population of Edinburgh. Dundee and Aberdeen have between 100,000 and 50,000; Paisley, Greenock, Leith, Perth, and Kilmarnock, between 50,000 and 20,000 ; and there are 10 additional towns having more than 10,000. There are 83 municipal and royal burghs, about one-third of which have populations under 2000; and 21 parliamentary burghs, returning 23 members. The towns generally occupy picturesque sites, and some of them, as Aberdeen, Glasgow, and the new parts of Edin burgh, are built with regularity and solidity. The majority, how ever, exhibit no characteristic features and possess little interest. Edinburgh, as the capital and the scene of many historical events, merits a more detailed notice. Antiquities. \u2014 Among the artificial structures of bygone ages which are interesting; in the topography of Scotland, we may notice the follow- ing: \u2014 (1 ) Druidical circles, of which the \"Ring of Broidgar\" at Stennis in the Orkneys is a famous ex ample. '2) Cairns, some of them of great size, one at JViinniegaff, in Kirkcudbrightshire, having a cir cumference of 891 ft. (3) Sepul chral barrows of peculiar shape, such as the ship-barrows of Iona, Ten navie in Perthshire, and elsewhere. (4) Monumental stones, designed to mark boundaries or the sites of bat tles; to the latter class belong the sculptured stones of Forres, Gossans near Glamis, St. Vigeans in Angus, and a few other places on the E. coast. (5) Picts' Houses, found about the N. and W. coasts, circular build ings, with chambers in the thick ness of the walls. (6) Subterranean abodes, invisible from the outside, and constructed with a certain de gree of architectural skill. (7) Vi trified forts on hill-summits, the 41. Forrea Pillar. origin of which is still a moot point among antiquaries: a fine specimen exists on Craig Phadric, near Inverness. (8) Round towers, of which there are two, at Abernethy and at Brechin, probably erected about the 9th or 10th centuries. (9) Roman antiquities, remains of Anto nine's Wall, camp on the Eildon hills, &c. Communications. \u2014 After the rebellions of 1715 and 1745, a few roads were constructed by the British Government for purely military pur poses, to connect the forts N. of the Grampians with the Lowlands, and to render the intermediate Highlands accessible to an invading army. One of these roads ran northwards from Dunkeld by Blair Athol to Fort Augustus ; a second from Cupar Angus by Braemar to Fort George; and a third from Dumbarton by Glencoe to Fort William. A"], [160, "144 SCOTLAND. Book I. fourth road followed the line of the Glenmore between Forts William and Augustus, and on to the Moray firth. S. ofthe Firths of Forth and Clyde, tbe roads were gradually improved towards the close of the last century but N. ofthe Glenmore the roads were not constructed until tlie early part of the present century, between 1803 aud 1820, when above 900 miles of new road were constructed by Telford, and commu nication with the S. was completed by the erection of bridges over the Tay at Dunkeld, and over the Spey at Craig-Ellachie. Canals are, from the nature of the country, rare : we may notice the one that con nects the Forth with the Clyde, constructed between the years 1768 and 1790; the Union Canal, which connects Edinburgh with tbe Forth and Clyde Canal at Falkirk; the Crinan Canal '9 m. long), across the neck of the peninsula of Cantyre ; and the Caledonian Canal, which connects Loch Eil on the W. coast with the Moray Firth on the E. coast by joining the series of lakes in the Glenmore : this grand enter prise, whereby vessels are enabled to pass from the North Sea to the Atlantic without encountering the dangerous navigation about the N. coast of Scotland, has unfortunately not proved remunerative: it was constructed by Telford in 1805-1823, and has a total length of 60 m., of which 20 are artificial canal and the remainder lake. The total length of canal in Scotland amounts to 225 miles. Railways now con nect all the principal towns of Scotland. The North British line connects Edinburgh by separate lines with Berwiek-on-Tweed and Carlisle. The Caledonian, starting from Carlisle, bifurcates at Carstairs to Edinburgh in one direction, and Glasgow in another. The latter town has a second route to Carlisle by way of Kilmarnock. The two capitals, Edinburgh and Glasgow, are also connected by a direct line. North of the Firth of Forth, the Scottish Central leads to Stirling and Perth, and thence two routes continue northwards to Inverness; one taking the coast-line to Aberdeen and then striking across to Elgin, and the other going inland by Blair Athol. The latter is continued N. of Inverness 58 m. to Bonar Bridge, in Sutherlandshire. The mileage of railway amounted in 1864 to 2105 miles, and the capital expended to 47,736,564?. \u00a7 12. Edinburgh.\u2014 Edinburgh stands about 2 m. S. of the Firth of Forth, on a remarkably picturesque and varied site. A ridge, gradually rising from E. to W. and terminating in precipitous cliffs, forms the backbone of the town. On each side of this there are parallel ridges of less elevation with intermediate valleys. Calton Hill and Arthur's Seat are striking eminences, the former N.E. and the latter (822 ft. high) S.E. of the centre of the town. The central ridge is crowned at its W. extremity with the Castle, whence a main street slopes down to Holyrood Palace on the low ground between Calton Hill and Arthur's Seat. Midway between these two points, the main street is intersected at right angles by streets which cross the depressions at an elevation ; North Bridge Street leading to the New Town, and South Bridge Street in the opposite direction. Edin- burgh consists of two parts, the Old Town, on the central ridge, con- spicuous for the remarkable height of its old bouses, and the New Town, on the north hill, laid out in regular streets and squares. The New Town dates from about 1770, and now extends beyond the Water of Leith, which is crossed by Dean Bridge at a high level."], [161, "Chap. V. EDINBURGH\u2014 SOUTHERN COUNTIES. 145 Noteworthy Objects, &c. \u2014 The Castle, on the highest part of the cen tral ridge, now used as a barrack : the regalia kept there : the birth place of James VI. : it was stoutly defended by Sir W. Kirkcaldy on behalf of Mary Queen of Scots. Holyrood Palace, with remains of the ancient abbey, founded 1128 by David I.: the palace itself a compa ratively modern building of various dates from 1528 downwards: Rizzio assassinated there by Darnley and others. The University, erected in 1789 on the site of an older building. St. Giles's Cathedral, in High-street, once an important collegiate building, subdivided after the Reformation into four churches, in one of which John Knox minis tered : the Solemn League and Covenant was subscribed here in 1643. Parliament House, in the same street, erected in 1640, and now used for the supreme law courts. Heriot's Hospital, erected 1660, for edu cational purposes. Donaldson's Hospital, an institution of the same character. History. \u2014 Edinburgh is said to owe its origin and name to Edwin, king of Northumbria, who in the 7th century built a fort (Edwin's burgh) on the site of the Castle. The town rose to importance under the Stuart dynasty towards the close of the 14th century ; became capital of Scotland in 1436; was fortified in 1450; was nearly burnt down in 1530; and was destroyed in 1542 by the Earl of Hertford. John Knox resided here from 1560 to his death. I. Southern Counties, 1. Edinburgh.\u2014 Edinburgh, 168,121. Leith, 33,628. Musselburgh, 7423. Dalkeith, 5396. Portobello, 4366. Newhaven, 2310. 2.

These counties contain the majority of the important towns mod. geo. h"], [162, "146 SCOTLAND. Book I, of Scotland. Edinburgh, as the capital, has been already described. Glasgow is the commercial metropolis, being the chief outlet for the products of the surrounding district, and itself engaged largely in ship-building and various manufactures, particularly cotton : it is also the seat of a University. In its neighbourhood are the important manufacturing towns of Paisley (silks, shawls, muslins, &c.) ; Johnston (cotton); Hamilton (lace and imitation cambric); Kilmarnock (car pets, yarn, calico-printing) ; and Airdrie (iron and collieries). Greenock is the chief port on the Firth of Clyde, and further down the coast we meet successively with the sea-port towns of Largs (a watering place) ; Ardrossan (packet-station for Arran and Belfast) ; Saltcoats (salt works, rope manufacture, and export of coal) ; Irvine, Troon, and Ayr (all engaged in the export of coal and iron, chiefly to Ire land) ; Stranraer, on Loch Ryan, and Portpatrick, ports in Wigton for transit to Ireland, the latter being only 21J m. from Donaghadee. On the E. coast are the maritime towns of Dunbar (engaged in the herring-fishery) ; North Berwick and PortoheUo, watering-places ; Leith and Granton, the ports of Edinburgh. In the interior may be noticed the manufacturing towns of Galashiels, Hawick, and Selkirk, all en gaged in making woollen goods, \" tweeds,\" &c. ; and Dumfries, the provincial capital of S.W. Scotland. Noteworthy Objects, &c. \u2014 Rosslyn Ghapel, on the North Esk, an ela borately decorated edifice, founded 1446.

Central Counties, Towns, &c. \u2014 The east-central counties are populous and wealthy from the combined resources of agriculture and manufactures. Some of the most fertile land of Scotland is to be found in the Carses of Stirling and Gowrie, and in the Strath more : and almost the whole of the soil between the Firth of Forth and the Dee is carefully cultivated. Coal is found in the S. of Fife, and along the course of the Forth to Stirling. The towns of the central counties are generally flourishing, and in many cases in teresting from historical associations. Dundee stands first in im portance as a manufacturing and sea-port town, its products being sailcloth, sacking, and coarse textures. The chief towns in the counties of Fife and Forfar are mostly engaged in the manufacture of linen and similar textures: in the former county we may specify Dunfermline, Cnpar, Kirkcaldy, and Dysart as so employed, and in For farshire, Arbroath, Forfar, Montrose, and Brechin. In the county of Stirling woollen manufactures are carried on at St. Ninian's, Bannock burn, and Stirling; cotton at Kilsyth, and iron-works both at this H 2"], [164, "148 SCOTLAND. Book I. latter place, at Carron near Falkirk, and elsewhere on the coal-field. Kirkintilloch, near Glasgow, is also engaged in cotton-works. Of special products, we may notice AUoa, on the Firth of Forth, as famed for its breweries, and Campbelltown, on the peninsula of Can tyre, for its distilleries. Numerous sea-ports occur on the E. coast, such as Alloa, Grangemouth (a packet-station), Burntisland (engaged in the herring-fishery), and Kirkcaldy, on the Firth of Forth ; Ar broath, Montrose, and Stonehaven (a watering-place), N. of the Firth of Tay. On the west coast we meet with Dumbarton, a fortress as well as a port ; Helensburg, a watering-place sor the Glasgow people, on the Firth of Clyde ; Rothsay, on Arran, a place of similar character : and Ohan, opposite the Isle of Mull, a packet-station for tourists visiting the Caledonian Canal, Staffa, &c. The ancient town of Perth, once the capital of Scotland, still retains much of its importance : Falkirk is famed for its \"trysts\" or fairs; and St. Andrews is the seat of a University. Noteworthy Objects. &c. \u2014 Stirling Castle, finely situated on a basaltic rock, one of the four fortresses maintained under the terms of the Union ; frequently the residence of the kings of Scotland ; captured by the English in 1304, and recovered by the Scots in 1314 ; James II. and James V. born in it, and the Earl of Douglas here assassinated by the former.

Northern Counties \u2014 Towns, &c. \u2014 These counties are, for the most part, covered with mountains and moorlands, serviceable only for rearing sheep and cattle. Agriculture is successfully pro secuted along the E. coast, some portion of tbe low-lying lands being very fertile. The wealth of this part of Scotland consists in its agricultural produce (live stock), and its fisheries both river and sea : the other products are kelp, granite from Aberdeensbire, and a certain amount of timber. The towns of the Northern counties call for little notice. The most important are the sea-ports on the E. eoast, whence the fishing and general traffic of the country is carried on. Foremost stands Aberdeen, a well-built handsome town, owing its title of the \" Granite City \" to the neighbouring quarries which have supplied the stone for its erection ; it is the seat of a large trade and of a University. Next in importance is Inverness, the capital of the Highlands, and the terminus of the Caledonian Canal. Then follow the ports of Peterhead, N. of Aberdeen, and Wick, near the N.E. angle of Scotland. Nairn is a rising watering-place, the \" Brighton\" of North Scotland. Thurso is the only place worthy of notice on the N. coast. Kirkwall is the capital of the Orkneys, Lerwick of the Shetlands, and Stornoway of the Outer Hebrides. Noteworthy Objects, &c. \u2014 Aberdeen, docks of large extent with two piers ; Marischal College, a modern erection iu lieu of older buildings; a fine Cross built in 1686 ; Union Street, about I m. long, and crossing a ravine by means of a lofty granite arch. Old Aberdeen (or, more pro perly, Aberdon, for it is situated at the mouth of the Don), King's College, founded 1494, with a fine chapel. Balmoral, on the banks of the Dee, the Queen's Highland residence. Peterhead harbour, rendered by recent improvements safe and commodious. Fraserburg harbour, also improved at considerable expense. Fort George, at the entrance of Beauly Firth, erected 1745. Cawdor Castle, near Nairn, a fine build ing of the 15th century, still occupied. Elgin Cathedral, founded 1223, destroyed 1390 by the \"Wolf of Badenoch,\" re-erected in the following century, extensive and interesting remains of it. Ruins of Pluscardine Abbey, near Elgin.

North and South, separated from Harris by the Sound of Harris, and from each other by the isle of Benhecula and tlie narrow chaunels surrounding it, South Uist having a length of 12 m., -with poor peaty soil, and North Uist a length of 17 m , irregular in shape, and with numerous lakes; Barra Isles, S. of Uist, a group of about 20, of which Barra is the largest, people engaged in fishing, Barra Head, the southernmost, crowned with a lighthouse at a height of 680 ft. ; Raasay, between Skye and the mainland; Eigg, S. of Skye, with basaltic cliffs; and others of less size, among which we may include St. Kilda, 52 m. W. of Harris, whose scant population (78) is engaged in fishing and fowling. Attached to Ross \u2014 Lewis, the largest of the Outer Hebrides, having a length (with Harris) of 60 m., terminating N. in the Butt of Lewis, with poor peaty soil, and mild but stormy climate; the Summer Isles, a group of 30 at the entrance of Loch Broom, Tanera, the largest, alone being inhabited ; Martin, Ewe, and Crolm. Attached to Sutherland, Roan ; and to Caithness, Stroma, in the Pentland Firth. The Orkneys, which with the Shetlands form a separate county, are separated from the mainland, by the Pentland Firth ; they comprise 56 islands (exclusive of 17 which are insulated at high water), with an aggregate area of 5377 sq. m. Of these only 28 are inhabited, the principal being Pomona or Mainland, 18 m. long, centrally situated, irregularly shaped, and hilly ; Hoy and South Ronaldsa, to the S. of it, the former conspicuous for the glittering summit of Wart Hill ; and to the N. of Mainland, at gradually receding distances : Rowsa and Shapinsa ; Stronsa, Eda, and Westra ; Sanda ; and North Ronaldsa. These islands receive the full benefit of the Gulf Stream, and have remarkably mild winters : the mean annual tempe rature is 46\u00b0, and the rainfall 37 inches. Fishing is the chief resource of the inhabitants, but agriculture thrives, and fair crops of bere, oats, and potatoes are raised. The Shetlands lie about 50 m. N.E. of the Orkneys, and consist of more than 100 isles and islets, of which 24 only are inhabited, including Fair Island, which lies midway between the main group and the Orkneys. The aggregate area amounts to 945 sq. m., and the population (in 1861) to 31,670. The islands are grouped closely together, with the exception of Fotda, which stands apart, con spicuous for its high hills. Mainland, the most southerly, is as large as all the rest put together, having a length of 60 m. : its outline, is very irregular and the width varies from 3 to 24 m. The other chief islands are Yell, Unst, and Fetlar. The Shetlands are hilly and bare : the shores rocky and indented ; the climate moist ; the soil peaty, that of Unst being the most fertile: chief productions, cattle, sheep, and ponies, all of diminutive size, woollen goods, and a large amount of fish, which is both exported and consumed.

Boundaries \u2014 Shape \u2014 Size \u2014 Population. \u2014 Ireland is sepa rated from Great Britain by the series of inclosed seas already de scribed (cap. II. \u00a7 2), viz. : \u2014 St. George's Channel, the Irish Sea, and the North Channel. The W. coast faces the open Atlantic, whose waters roll in upon it unbroken by any such natural breakwater as the Hebrides supply to the coast of Scotland. Ireland approaches in shape to a rhomboid, of which the N. and S. sides are shorter than the E. and \\V., and the angles at the N.W. and S.E. are obtuse. The greatest extension is thus in a diagonal direction from N.E. to S.W., a distance of about 300 m. ; but the greatest length on a meridian is about 234 m. The extreme breadth on a parallel (54\u00b0 16' N. lat.) is 180 m., but the central breadth between Dublin and Galway Bays is only 108 m. The extreme points are: \u2014 N., Malin Head, 55\u00b0 22' N. lat.; S., Mizen Head, 51\u00b0 27' N. lat.; E., Halbert Point, 5\u00b0 2G' W. long. ; and W., Dunmore Head, 10\u00b0 29'"], [169, "Chap. VI. BOUNDARIES, COASTS, BAYS, ETC. 153 W. long. The area is estimated at 32,512 sq. m. ; and the popula tion (in 1861) at 5,798,987. \u00a7 2. Coast \u2014 Bays \u2014 Promontories. \u2014 The coast-line of Ireland is estimated at 2300 m., which gives a proportion of 1 m. of coast for 14 sq. m. of area. The proportion is less than in Scotland, but con siderably greater than in England. The W. coast exhibits the largest amount of sinuosity : in the S.W. angle are three long taper ing bays, which give a peculiarly jagged appearance to the outline ; more to the N. there is an extensive westerly protrusion, occupied by the counties of Mayo and Galway, also having a remarkably irregular coast-line. The three bays in the S.W. are named Bantry Bay, Kenmare Bay, and Dingle Bay, and the westerly protrusion is bounded S. by Galway Bay. The estuary of the Shannon, S. of Galway Bay, and Donegal Bay, N. of the above mentioned protrusion, are the other chief features on this coast. On the N. coast, we may notice Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle ; and on the E. coast, Belfast Lough, Lough Strangford, and Dundalk Bay : on the S. coast the indentations are on a smaller scale. The most noticeable promontories are Malin Head, in the extreme N. ; Carnsore Point, at the S.E. angle ; Mizen Head, in the S.W. ; and Dunmore Head, on the peninsula N. of Dingle Bay. The E. coast is generally low ; the others high and bold. We subjoin a more detailed account of the bays and capes. Bays, Capes, &c. \u2014 Commencing with Malin Head and proceeding round by the E. we meet with Lough Foyle, penetrating 18 m. to the S.W., and having its entrance contracted by Magilligan Point ; Giant's Causeway, near Bengore Head, a basaltic formation projecting about 700 ft. into the sea, and consisting of 3 platforms, distinguished as the Little, Middle, and Great Causeways, the columns being chiefly pent agonal and hexagonal, and remarkable for the perfectness of their structure ; Bengore Head, a cluster of promontories ; Fair Head, a precipitous mass of greenstone columns; Belfast Lough, 12 m. long; Lough Strangford, a large shallow inlet protruding N.W. in a line parallel to the coast, and so enclosing a long peninsula; St. John's Point, forming the N. limit of the wide and open Dundrum Bay ; Carlingford Bay, connected by the Newry Canal with Lough Neagh ; Dundalk Bay, between Cooley Point in the N., and Dunany Point in the S. ; Dublin Bay, bounded N. by Howth Head (563 ft. high), and having a length and breadth of about 7 m. ; Wicklow Head ; Cahore Point ; Carnsore Point, the S.E. extremity of the island ; Waterford Harbour, the estuary of the Suir ; Youghal Harbour, the estuary of the Blackwater ; Cork Harbour ; Kinsale Harbour ; Dunmanus Bay, 12 m. long, bounded S. by Mizen Head, the S.W. extremity of the island ; Bantry Bay, a magni ficent natural harbour, penetrating 25 m. inland, and separated from Dunmanus Bay on the S. by the peninsula that terminates in Sheep Head, and from Kenmare Bay on the N., by the rugged peninsula which is prolonged in Dursey island, and terminates in Dursey Head; Dingle Bay, an extensive inlet more open and exposed than either of the two ju-st mentioned, bounded S. by the isle of Valencia, aud N. by Dunmore Head ; the Shannon Estuary, 7 m. wide at its mouth, and 43 m. long, h 3"], [170, "Book I. 154 IRELAND. its limits marked S. by Kerry Head, and N. by Loop Head ; Galway Bay, another large inlet, protected to a certain degree from the swell ofthe Atlantic by the Arran Isles, between which and the mainland access is given to the bay by the North and South Sounds ; Clew Bay, its upper end studded with islets; Achill Head, on the island of the same name; Erris Head and Benwee Head, in the N.W. of Mayo, at the entrance of Broadhaven Bay ; Killala Bay ; Sligo Bay, terminating inland in three lesser bays ; Donegal Bay, about 25 m. long, and containing on its N. side several subordinate inlets ; Telin Head, the N. limit of Donegal Bay ; Farland, or Bloody-Fareland Point ; Horn Head, a lofty headland at the W. entrance of Sheep Haven ; and Lough Swilly, a long narrow inlet penetrating 25 m. in a southerly direction. \u00a7 3. Harbours. \u2014 Ireland possesses an amount of harbourage such as no other country in the world can show. It has above 60 good harbours, of which 14 are capable of receiving the largest vessels, and in some of these the whole navy of Britain might ride safely. But the distribution of this harbourage detracts materially from its value : many fine harbours are so remote as to be wasted, while the more frequented seas and districts labour under a deficiency. The E. coast in particular falls under the latter description. Dublin Bay is much exposed to easterly gales, and Dublin harbour has required long piers and constant dredging to make it accessible. Kingstown, at the S. entrance of the bay, is the best port for large vessels : Howth harbour, on the N. side, is formed by two fine piers, but is little frequented. S. from Kingstown there is no harbour until Wex ford, which though spacious is shallow and encumbered with sand banks. N. from Dublin, Drogheda 1 is accessible to small vessels only, in consequence of a bar at the mouth of the Boyne ; Dundalk Bay is shallow ; Carlingford Lough has a bar ; Lough Strangford is sheltered and deep, but difficult of access ; Donaghadee is a mere artificial port ; and Belfast Lough, though accessible, shoals towards the shores. On the N. coast, Lough Foyle is difficult to navigate on account of the sand-banks, but vessels of 400 tons reach Derry : Lough Swilly is deep and clear of impediments. On the S. coast, Waterford Bay is deep and spacious : vessels of 500 tons can reach Waterford, and there is an artificial but now deserted port, Dunmore, at the W. entrance of the bay, intended for a packet-station. W. of this to Cork Harbour the only ports are Dungarvan and Youghal, neither of which are accessible to vessels of any size. Cork Harbour is a fine land-locked sheet of water, approached by a narrow passage guarded by Forts Camden and Carlisle, and having in it several islands : the water is deep and the anchorage excellent. Kinsale and Crookhaven, in Long Island Bay, are safe harbours on the same coast, protected from westerly gales. The fine inlets of the W. coast abound with harbourage at the points where protection is offered against westerly 1 Pronounced Droyda."], [171, "Chap. VI. HARBOURS\u2014 CONFIGURATION\u2014 MOUNTAINS. 155 gales : thus in Bantry Bay, Bear Island, and Whiddy Island offer safe roadsteads in all weathers, and the bay is everywhere deep ; Kenmare Bay has a sheltered inlet at Kilmakilloge ; and at the entrance of Dingle Bay there is a splendid roadstead between Va lentia and Inchbeg : Ventry Harbour in the same bay is exposed, and Dingle and Castlemaine are only accessible to small vessels. Pro ceeding northwards we reach Tralee Bay, at the inmost point of which is Blennerville, the port of Tralee, with which it is connected by a ship-canal. The estuary of the Shannon offers safe anchor age at Carrigaholt Bay, Inniscattery Island, Tarhert Island, and other places. Galway Bay has a natural breakwater in the Arran isles, and possesses numerous creeks and small bays ; Galway harbour on the N.E. coast has been provided with docks, &c, with a view to a Trans-Atlantic commerce. Clew Bay, sheltered by Clare Island, and studded with islands at its head, has ports of no great capacity at Newport and Westport. On the N. coast of Mayo, Broadhaven harbour is confined, and Killala shallow. Sligo harbour, in the bay of the same name, is provided with a pier, &c. In Donegal Bay, good harbourage is found in Killybegs Bay on the N. coast ; and there are moderately good harbours at Donegal and Ballyshannon. \u00a7 4. Configuration \u2014 Mountains. \u2014 The most prominent feature in the configuration of Ireland is the Great Plain, which covers the whole central portion of the island between Dublin and Galway Bays, with a length from N. to S. of about 160 m., and a breadth of about 120 m. This plain is for the most part level, and has an average elevation of from 250 to 300 ft. above the level of the sea. Around the edge of it the mountains rise in detached groups near the coast and assume the forms, sometimes of continuous ranges, sometimes of circular clusters, and sometimes of irregular highlands. The groups are usually described under the names of the counties where they are found, there being no dorsal chains sufficiently important to have imposed their names on the ad jacent mountains. On the W. coast, where the mountains are most numerous, three groups may be distinguished, viz. : \u2014 the mountains of Donegal in the N. ; the mountains of Mayo and Galway in the westerly protrusion; and the mountains of Kerry in the S. On the E. coast the chief groups are the Wicklow Mountains S. of Dublin Bay ; and the Mourne Mountains, N. of Dundalk Bay. The coast of Antrim is fringed with ranges, and irregular elevations cover the district between Lough Neagh and the Donegal group. We add some particulars as to these groups. The Wicklow Mountains are an irregular mass of detached hei hts, abounding in picturesque scenery and culminating in Lugnaquilla (3039 ft.). The range between the rivers Slaney and Barrow, which contains Mount LeinBter (2610 ft.), may be regarded as an offset from"], [172, "Book I. 156 IRELAND. this group. Near the S. coast the parallel ranges of the Galty and Knockmeiledown Mountains are found near the point where the Sun approximates to the Blackwater; the latter is a fine range attaining an elevation of 2598 ft. The Kerry Mountains, in the S.W. angle of the island, present the loftiest heights and the finest outline of any in Ireland ; the most remarkable portion is named M'Gillicuddy Reeks, S.W. of Killarney, with the crowning height of Carran-Tual 3414 ft.): various spurs cover the peninsula between Dingle and Kenmare Bays, while N. of the former the Dingle peninsula is occupied by a broad ridge which terminates in the fine mass of Brandon (3127 ft.). Between tlie Shannon and Galway Bay the ranges are unimportant; N. of Galway Bay the whole sea-board of Galway and Mayo is rugged with moun tains. In the Connemara district or western Galway, the most dis tinctive feature is furnished by the range of Binnabeola or the Twelve Pins, of which Benhaun (2395 ft.) is the highest. The Mayo hills are divided into groups, of which we may distinguish, S. of Clew Bay, tl*>se of which Muilrea (2688 ft.) and the conical height of Croagh Patrick (2510 ft.) are the centres; and N. of Clew Bay, the Nephin Beg range with the rounded summit of Nephin 2646 ft. I near Lough Conn, and the more westerly heights of Slieve Car (2369 ft.) and Nephin Beg (2065 ft.). In the N.W. are the Donegal Mountains, of which the most marked features are: \u2014 Blue Stack (2219 ft.) with the adjacent moun tains in the S. ; the fine range of Derryveagh (2240 ft.), running in a continuous line from N.E. to S.W.; Errigal (2466 ft.) lying W. of the range just mentioned; and the knotty group which occupies the penin sula of Innishowen between Loughs Foyle and Swilly, and of which Slieve Snaght (2019 ft.) is the centre. The range that skirts the E. coast between Fair Head and Belfast Lough is broad but not lofty, ter minating northwards in magnificent cliffs, and having as its highest point Trostan (1817 ft.). Between Lough Neagh and Belfast Lough is a range containing Divis and Cave Hill. In the S. of Down, between Carlingford and Dundrum Bays, are the Mourne Mountains, culminating in Slieve Donard (2796 ft.), and containing very fine scenery. The Central Plain has a few ranges rising out of it : of these we may notice the Slieve Bloom Mountains about the sources of the Suir and the Barrow; and the Silver-Mine Mountains with the lofty summit of Mount Keeper (2278 ft.), between the Upper Suir and the Shannon. \u00a7 5. Eivers. \u2014 The hydrography of Ireland is much affected hy the peculiarity of its conformation. The rivers may be distributed into two classes \u2014 (1) the rivers of the Central Plain ; (2) the rivers of the mountains surrounding the plain. The former are the most important in a commercial point of view ; for they have gentle and consequently navigable streams, and the nature of the intervening country is such as to facilitate their junction by canals. In mis class we may place the Shannon, incomparably the finest river in Ireland, which drains a considerable portion of the plain, and forms a highway to the west coast ; the Barrow, Suir, and Nore, which unite in Waterford harbour on the S. coast ; and the Liffey, and the Boyne on the E. coast. The second class of rivers are swifter, more tor tuous, and generally shorter than the former ; still there are some considerable streams in this class, such as the Blaokwater, on the S."], [173, "CnAP. VI. RIVERS AND LAKES. 157 coast ; the Slaney, on the S.E. ; the Bann, connected with Lough Neagh, and the Foyle, on the N. ; and the Erne, on the W. coast. Ihe subjoined table exhibits some particulars relative to these rivers : \u2014 The Shannon issues from a cavern in the Cuilcach range at the slight elevation of 345 ft,, and in 11 m. it reaches Lough Allen at an eleva tion of 161 ft. : it subsequently traverses, or rather expands into, Loughs Boderg, Ree, and Derg, below the last of which it bends from S.W. to W. and reaches its estuary. Rapids occur below Lough Derg, which impede navigation and have necessitated a. certain amount of canalization. The Shannon receives on its rt. bank the Boyle and the Suck ; on its left the Iuny and the Brosna : its estuary is fed by the Fergus from the N., and the Maigue, Deel, and Feale from the S. The Barrow rises in the Slievebloom Mountains, descends rapidly N.E. and E. to Portarlington at an elevation of only 227 ft. above the sea, and shortly after turns S. ; receives the Nore and the Suir, which have their sources in the same quarter, but deviate more to the W. ; and terminates in Waterford Harbour. Each of the streams is serviceable for navigation, the Barrow especially. The Boyne rises in the Bog of Allen at an elevation of 225 ft., and receives the Blackwater from the N.W. The Liffey rises in the Wicklow mountains, and sweeps round in a horseshoe form to the Bay of Dublin. It is swift throughout, and derives its chief importance from having the metropolis on its banks. The Bann is divided into two portions, the Upper and Lower Bann, the former rising in the Mourne Mountains, and discharging itself into Lough Neagh ; the latter issuing from the N. end of the lake and reaching the sea after a course of 40 m. \u00a7 6. Lakes. \u2014 The lakes of Ireland form a conspicuous feature in the aspect of the country, both from their number and size. They cover 336 sq. m., and are more numerous in the W. than else where. They are generally rocky and shallow, and consequently unserviceable for navigation : the picturesque scenery of some, par ticularly the Killarney lakes, is well known. Lough Neagh, th\" largest of the lakes, covers an area of 98,255 acres ; has low marshy banks ; is navigated by steamers ; receives the Bann, Blackwater, and other streams, and discharges its surplus waters by the Lower River.

Lough Erne, in the county of Fermanagh, consists of a double lake, Upper and Lower, with an intermediate stream; both lakes are studded with islands ; surplus waters discharged into Donegal Bay by the river Erne. Lough Corrib, near Galway, is a navigable lake of laro-e size ; Lough Mask, in the same neighbourhood, is connected with it by a subterranean channel. The Killarney lakes, 3 in number, lie embosomed amid the Kerry mountains: they have numerous islands and well-wooded banks. \u00a7 7. Minerals. \u2014 The mineral resources of Ireland are on a re stricted scale. There are five coal-fields in the carboniferous lime stone region, viz.\u2014 (1) Kilkenny and Castle Comer. (2) Munster. (3) Roscommon and Leitrim. (4) Tyrone. (5) Ballycastle. The produce of these fields is insignificant, amounting in 1861 to only 123,070 tons raised from 46 collieries. Ironstone is common, but is not smelted ; some of it is exported to England. Lead is also gene rally diffused, but the mines are few ; the principal are the Lugga nure and Glendalough in Wicklow, Newtownards in Down, and the College mines in Armagh. Copper is found in the counties of Wicklow, Waterford, Cork, and Kerry, and is exported to Swansea for smelting ; the total yield in 1862 was 15,229 tons. Salt is found at Duncrue, near Belfast ; gold at Croghan-Kinshela, in Wicklow ; and zinc in Tipperary. The bog-soil yields valuable supplies of fuel. Mineral Springs. \u2014 Mineral springs occur at Mallow, in Cork (saline) ; at Newcastle, near Kilkeel, and at Ballynahinch, in Down (sulphureous) ; at Lucan, near Dublin (sulphureous) ; and at Ballyspellan, near Johnstown, co. Kilkenny. \u00a7 8. Population \u2014 Agriculture \u2014 Manufactures \u2014 Pleligion\u2014 Education. \u2014 The population of Ireland has decreased to an extraor dinary degree during the last 20 years. In 1841 it amounted to 8,175,124, and in 1861 to 5,798,967 ; the rate of decrease was much greater between '41 and '51, than between '51 and '61, so that, com paratively speaking, there was a revival in the latter period. The potato-famine and the consequent emigration have been the imme diate causes of this decrease ; but the radical cause is over-population. Even now, Ireland is thickly populated for a purely agricultural country, considering the amount of uncultivable land in it ; the number of inhabitants to the sq. m. is greater than in Wales, France, Prussia, and the majority of the European states. The people aie almost wholly Celts of the Erse branch, and the Erse language is still spoken exclusively by about 163,000, and partly by 1,100,000 persons, resident in Munster and Connaught. Agriculture forms the chief occupation of the Irish ; manufactures arc confined to the N.E., about Belfast, and give employment to about 38,000 people ; com merce is restricted to the export of linen and live-stock, and to the provision trade (butter and pork) carried on at Cork."], [175, "Chap. VI. MINERALS, POPULATION, AGRICULTURE, ETC. 159 Agriculture. \u2014 The cultivable soil of Ireland is estimated at 15,000,000 acres, of which about 5,500,000 acres are under tillage, and the re mainder in pasture. The tillage has been diminishing of late years, particularly as respects potatoes and cereals. Oats occupy the largest area ; then come potatoes ; and far below these, wheat and green crops. The best arable lands are found along the banks of the Shannon (locally termed corcasses), and in the counties of Tyrone, Derry, and Kildare. Kerry and Carlow are the best dairy counties ; Tipperary, Roscommon, Westmeath, and Meath, have rich grazing lands. Flax is largely grown in Down, Antrim, Tyrone, and Derry. The progress of agriculture has been much retarded by the prevalence of the cottier system ; but the number of small holdings is annually decreasing. The bog soil appears to be irrecoverable, except at a ruinous expenditure. The bogs occupy about 3,000,000 acres, the great bulk of which is found in the central district, and would be enclosed between lines drawn from Wicklow Head to Galway, and from Dublin to Sligo ; within these limits by far the largest proportion lies W. of the Shannon. E. of that river the bog district in Kildare, Queen's, and King's Counties, is known as the Bog of Allen. Manufactures. \u2014 The only considerable manufacture is linen, which is made at Belfast and the neighbouring places : it was introduced by Huguenot refugees after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Sewed muslins are another branch of industry in the same locality. Woollen stuffs are made for home use in the central counties, and there are nine cotton factories in the country. Distilling and the pre paration of flour are the only other businesses of importance. Religion. \u2014 The Established Church of Ireland is under two arch bishops (Armagh and Dublin), and ten bishops, some of whom hold four, and all more than one, of the old dioceses. The Established Church is everywhere surpassed in influence and numbers by the Roman Catholic Church; and in Ulster, which is the stronghold of Protestantism, it has a second formidable rival in the Presbyterian Church. By the census of 1861 the Roman Catholics numbered 4,490,583; the Established Church 678,661 ; the Presbyterians 528,992; and the other Dissenting bodies 57,571. The animosity engendered by religious differences is one of the great sores from which Ireland suffers. The Roman Catholic Church is superintended by four archbishops (Armagh, Dublin, Cashel, and Tuam), and 23 bishops. The con stitution of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland resembles that of Scotland. The ministers are partly supported by the Regiu-m Donum, a fund instituted by Charles II. in 1672, and now continued by Go vernment. Education. \u2014 Ireland possesses two Universities, viz. : \u2014 Dublin, con sisting of Trinity College, founded in 1591 ; and Queen's University, founded in 1850, and consisting of the three Queen's Colleges erected at Belfast, Cork, and Galway : Dublin is connected with the Esta blished Church, and Queen's is independent of religious creed. The ultimate success of Queen's University seems doubtful, inasmuch as it does not meet with the approval of the Roman Catholics. May nooth College was founded in 1795, and receives an annual grant from Parliament : it is designed for the education of the Roman Catholic priesthood. The Royal Belfast Academical Institution, founded iu 18u7, undertakes the education of students of all ages, and is connected with the University of London. Grammar schools were founded by Charles I. at Armagh and six other towns."], [176, "Book I. 160 IRELAND. \u00a7 9. Political Divisions. \u2014 Ireland is divided into 4 Provinces, Leinster, Ulster, Connaught, and Munster, and 32 counties, of which Leinster contains 12, Ulster 9, Connaught 5, and Munster 6. They are further subdivided into 316 baronies, just as England is into hundreds; and again into parishes. The four provinces represent the old territorial divisions at the time of the conquest of Ireland in 1172, Meath, which was a fifth principality, having been com bined with Leinster. The division into counties commenced in King John's reign, and was then applied to the district \" within the pale,\" or such parts of Leinster and Munster as were occupied by the English. Connaught and Ulster were similarly subdivided in Eliza beth's reign. Westmeath was separated from Meath in Henry VIIL's reign. King's County and Queen's County date from Mary's reign, and Wicklow from James I.'s; these districts having previously formed part of the adjacent counties. The titles of the counties are derived from the principal towns at the time of the division, -with tbe following exceptions : \u2014 King's and Queen's Counties, which are so named after Philip and Mary ; Meath, which was one of the principalities ; and the old territories of Tyrone, Fermanagh, and Kerry. In several instances the old towns have been superseded by others as the county towns, as in the cases of Mayo, Clare, and Kildare. \u00a7 10. Towns \u2014 Antiquities \u2014 Communications. \u2014 The Irish towns are for the most part poor in wealth, appearance, and population. Dublin numbers above 300,000 inhabitants, attracted thither by the various government establishments, and by the facilities for commu nication with England. Belfast and Cork are the only other towns with 100,000 inhabitants ; the former the manufacturing metropolis of Ireland, the latter the chief port and the seat of the provision trade. Limerick, on the Shannon, the capital of the West, has above 50,000; and the ports of Waterford in the S., Galway in the W., and London derry in the N., above 20,000. Kilkenny, on the Nore, an agricul tural centre, Drogheda, on the Boyne, and Sligo on the W. coast, have over 15,000. Armagh is the scat of the primacy of \"all Ire land.\" Even the largest towns have few buildings worthy of notice; the architectural beauties of Ireland belong to a past age, and are to be found in the ruined abbeys and castles, scattered over the country. Antiquities, \u2014 Ireland abounds with monuments of its former inhabi tants. Among these we may notice : \u2014 (1) The Druidical circles of earth or stones, of which there are good examples in the Giant's Ring, near Belfast, a mound enclosing an area of 10 acres ; and in the stone circle at Beltany, near Raphoe. (2) Cromlechs, situated near the coast-line, as at Mount Venus, near Howth ; Shanganagh, near Dublin ; Broadstone, near Ballymena, &c. (3) Tumuli, which are common everywhere, but nowhere so remarkably as between Dro-heda"], [177, "161 Chap. VI. POLITICAL DIVISIONS, TOWNS, ETC. and Slane, where there is a succession of them, some of enormous size, as that at Newgrange, 70 ft. high, with a chamber containing a large amount of carved work ; and again those at Knowth and Dowth, in the same line. (4) Inscribed or Ogham stones, probably designed for bound ary marks ; they are chiefly fouud in Cork and Kerry. (5) Raths or forti fied villages, enclosed with a mound and ditch, and sometimes containing subterranean chambers. The Hill of Tara, in Meath, offers several ex amples of raths. (6) Duns or Ca thairs, military works constructed of stone ; they are most numerous in the W. -and S.W., and some of them in very good preservation, such as are those of Dun\u00e6rigus and Duu connor, in the isle of Arran. (7, Round Towers, to which a high an tiquity has been sometimes ascribed, but now supposed to have been mostly erected in the 9th and 10th centuries : they were intended to serve as belfries and places of de fence. 43. Hound Tower Communications. \u2014 Ireland is provided with excellent high-roads, con structed and kept in repair in some instances by county rates, in others by grants from Government. The system of turnpike trusts does not prevail there. There are but two canals of any importance, the Grand Canal, and the Royal Canal ; both commence at Dublin and cross the central plain to the Shannon, the Grand (164 m.) taking a somewhat southerly course by Tullamore to near Banagher and on to Ballinasloe ; the Royal (92 m.J diverging to the N. by Mullingar to Tormanbury in Co. Longford : the construction of the first commenced in 1756, and of the second in 1789, and both involved a large expenditure of time and money. The Newry navigation connects Lough Neagh with Carling ford Bay, partly by the Upper Bann and partly by artificial canal. The Lagan navigation is of similar character, and connects Lough Neagh with Belfast. The mileage of canal amounts to 276 m. Trunk lines of railway radiate from Dublin to various parts of the island, N. to Belfast and Londonderry ; W. to Galway, with branches from Mullin gar to Sligo, and from Athlone to Westport; S.W. to Cork, with branches to Limerick and Tralee ; and S. to Waterford and Wexford by independent lines, the former by Kilkenny, the latter by the coast. The Irish system is still in course of construction. The mileage at present (1865) in operation amounts to 1794 m., and the capital expended to 24,891,479;. \u00a7 11. Dublin. \u2014 Dublin is situated on the banks of the Liffey at the head of Dublin Bay, 63 m. from Holyhead, and 133 from Liver pool. The site of the town is level, with some slight elevations, but the scenery of the neighbourhood is beautiful. The river divides the town equally into N. and S. portions ; it is crossed by 9 bridges, of"], [178, "IRELAND. Book I. 162 which the Carlisle is the finest; below this bridge its banks are lined with quays, and the river serves as the port ; at its entrance are two gigantic walls, the southern 3\u00a3 m. long, to prevent the en croachment of the sands. The Grand Canal sweeps round the town on the S., and terminates in docks communicating with the Liffey; the Royal Canal approaches the river from the N. The town con tains few fine streets or squares; Sackville Street is, however, a notable exception. Noteworthy Objects, &c. \u2014 The chief public buildings are congregated within a small area, and consist of the Castle, or official residence of the Viceroy, founded in the 13th century ; Trinity College, erected in 1759; the Bank of Ireland, formerly the Parliament House, built 1729, with a handsome Ionic front ; the Four Courts, on the river side, erected in 1786-1800 ; and the Custom House, below Sackville Street, founded in 1781. Of ecclesiastical buildings may be noticed St. Patrick's Cathedral, in the early pointed style; and Christchurch Cathedral, a cruciform building of the llth century. The Ph\u0153nix Park lies W. of the city, covering 1759 acres ; it commands charming views of the Wicklow mountains. I. Leinster. 1. Dublin\u2014 Dublin, 304,710. Kingstown, 12,469. Rathmines, 4333.

Position, Poundaries, Size, &c.\u2014 The Iberian, or (as it is otherwise termed) the Pyrenean peninsula, is the most westerly of the three southern peninsulas of Europe. It is also the most westerly portion of the tvhole continent, from which it stands out in a state of almost complete isolation, like the bastion-tower of an old fortress, deserving on this account, as well as from its massive proportions, the title accorded to it of \" The Peninsula.\" It is connected with the body of the Continent by an isthmus 260 m. in breadth, across which the Pyrenees stretch in an unbroken rampart between the Mediter ranean and the Bay of Biscay. The boundary on the side of France follows the crest of the range until it nears the angle of the Bay of Biscay, which it reaches by an irregular line at the mouth of the"], [184, "THE IBERIAN PENINSULA. Book I. 168 Bidass<5a. In other directions the peninsula is bounded by the sea, viz. :\u2014 N. by the Bay of Biscay ; W. and S.W. by the open Atlantic; S. by the Strait of Gibraltar ; S.E. and E. by the Mediterranean. As it is separated from Africa only by the narrow Strait of Gibraltar, and from Europe by the massive barrier of the Pyrenees, its com munications are more open witb the former than with the latter continent. It stretches through about 8 degrees of lat. and 13 degrees of long., the extreme points being : \u2014 N., Cape Ortegal, 43\u00b0 48' N. lat. ; S., Punta di Tarifa, 36\u00b0 2' N. lat. ; E., Cape Creux, 3\u00b0 2ff E. long. ; and W., Cape Eoca, 9\u00b0 3C W. long. The length along the N. coast is 635 m., and the breadth in the meridian of Tarifa, 510 m. Its shape resembles a trapezium, of which the S. side is short as compared with the N., and the E. slopes off at an obtuse angle from the S. The area is estimated at 227,420 sq, m., of which 190,936 (about five-sixths of the whole) belong to Spain, and the remainder, 36,484, to Portugal. \u00a7 2. Coast-line \u2014 Bats \u2014 Promontories \u2014 Harbours. \u2014 Thecoast line of the Peninsula combines regularity in its general outline with irregularity in its details. The absence of deep inlets is unfavourable for commerce with the interior, but the numerous small indentations supply ample harbourage for shipping. On the N. coast we may notice Capes Penas in Asturias, and Ortegal in Galicia : the chief harbours are near the S.E. angle of the Bay of Biscay, and are San Sebastian, which is small but secure ; Bilbao, which consists of the estuary of the Nervion ; and Santander, on the bay of the same name, capacious and sheltered, and adapted by its position to serve as the port of Madrid. In the N.W. angle between Capes Ortegal and Finisterre is the Ria de Betanzos, which divides into branches and fur nishes first-rate harbours at Ferrol and Cortmna. Between Cap. Finisterre and the Minho are the harbours of Pontevedra and Vigo, the former serviceable for small vessels only, the latter a place of call for our Peninsular steamers. In Portugal the estuary of the Douro serves as the harbour of Oporto, and the Tagus as the harbour of Lisbon : the port of Lisbon could accommodate the navies of all Examples.

VIL COAST-LINE\u2014 CONFIGURATION. 169 Europe ; but Oporto is inconvenienced by a bar at the mouth of the river and by a strong current after rainy weather. S. of Lisbon is the bay and harbour of Setubal, of ample dimensions and with deep water, but with its entrance impeded by sandbanks. The chief pro montories on the coast of Portugal are C. Boca, N. of the Tagus ; C. Espiohel, S. of the Tagus ; and C. St. Vincent, at the S.W. angle. On the S. coast, the Guadalquivir is navigable for sea-going ships, and supplies harbourage at San lucar close to its mouth. The bay of Cadiz is 5 m. in length, and sheltered by the spit of land on which the town stands. The Bay of Gibraltar is about 6 m. long, and sheltered on all sides except the S. : it has two harbours, on the E. side at Gibraltar, where the shipping is protected by two moles, and on the W. side at Algeoiras. The harbour of Malaga is formed by a mole and is accessible and safe. The chief promontories on the S. eoast are C. Trafalgar ; Europa Point, the extremity of the rock of Gibraltar ; and C. Gata. In the S.E. the harbour of Cartagena is admirably sheltered by the island of Scombraria in front, and in other directions by the disposition of the land. The E. coast is not so well provided with harbours as the others : Alicante, on a small bay, possesses a good roadstead : the harbour of Tarragona is formed by a mole within which ships of war can ride at anchor : that of Barcelona is similarly formed, but in consequence of a bar is inac cessible to large ships. The fine Bay of Eosas, near the N.E. frontier, is unfrequented. The promontories on this eoast are C. Palos in Murcia ; C. St. Martin in Valencia ; and C. Creux, the extremity of the Pyrenees. The total length of the coast-line is 1900 m., of which 1400 belong to Spain and 500 to Portugal. The names of several of the promontories have been rendered illustrious by naval engagements \u2014 Trafalgar, by Nelson's victory in 1805 ; St. Vincent, by the victories of Rodney in 1780, of Jervis in 1797, and of Napier in 1836; and Finisterre, by Anson's victory over the French in 1747, and Calder's battle with Villeneuve in 1805. \u00a7 3. Configuration. \u2014 The configuration of the Iberian peninsula is characterised by a remarkable degree of symmetry. The nucleus or heart of it consists of a very extensive plateau, or rather double plateau, which occupies about one-half of the peninsula. This double plateau is buttressed N. by the Cantabrian Mountains, and S. hy the Sierra Mor^na : eastward it terminates in the highlands which bound the basin of the Ebro, and westward it declines towards the Atlantic. It is divided into two portions by a central range, which near Madrid is known as the Sierra Guadarama : the northern portion is distinguished as the plateau of Old Castile, the southern as that of New Castile : the latter ia again subdivided by a chain which rises within itself, named the Mountains of Toledo. The central plateau-region is skirted E. and S. by two extensive river- mod. geo. i"], [186, "170 THE IBERIAN PENINSULA. Book I. basins, viz., that of the Ebro, between the highlands above referred to and the Pyrenees, and that of the Guadalquivir between the Sierras Morena and Nevada. Maritime regions intervene between the Sierra Nevada and the Mediterranean in the S., and between the Cantabrian range and the Bay of Biscay in the N. The mountains descend to the coast by a series of terraces, a feature which is most conspicuous in Portugal and in the southern offsets of the Sierra Nevada. The ranges are frequently little else than the rims of the plateaus, and have consequently very unequal heights on their two sides : this is the case with the Sierra Morena and others. Another form of the plateau-formation is exhibited in the Sierra Estrella, which descends sharply on its S. side, and slopes away very gra dually N. towards the Mondego. In several respects \u2014 in the regu larity of its outline, the amount of plateau, and the terrace-formation \u2014 the Iberian Peninsula resembles Africa rather than Europe. \u00a7 4. Mount ain-Eanges. \u2014 The chief lines of mountain-range1 have been briefly described in the preceding paragraph. These lines are for the most part so extensive and complicated that they can rarely be described under general titles, and the multiplicity of local names forms one of the difficulties of Spanish geography. We will en deavour to group the various systems under a few heads. (1) The Pyrenees with their westerly continuations are the most important as well as the most extensive system. The Pyrenees themselves may be divided into 3 sections : \u2014 the Eastern, from Cape Creux to the head of the Garonne ; the Central or High Pyrenees, thence to the Gave d'Ossau ; and the Western Pyrenees, thence to the Pass of Passages. The westerly continuation is described by geographers under the general name of the Cantabrian Mountains ; this also falls into three divisions, \u2014 the Biseayan Mountains in the E., the Asturian Mountains in the centre, and the Galician Mountains in the W. : these mountains consist of a crest-range with extensive ramifications covering the space intervening between it and the Bay of Biscay, and rendering the maritime provinces remarkably rugged. (2) The Iberian Groups is the name assigned by geographers to the series of detached groups of mountains with intervening plateaus, which separate the central region from the basin of the Ebro. The line assumes a crescent shape protruding eastwards towards the Medi terranean, and connecting the Cantabrian Mountains in the N., with the Sierra Guadarama in the centre, and the Sierras More'na and Nevada in the S. The principal ranges in this from N. to S. are the Sierras of Ooa near Burgos, Moncayo near the head of the Douro, 1 The term \" Sierra,\" so generally applied to the mountains of Spain [Serva in Por tugal), is usually referred to the Latin serra, \" saw,\" as representing the jagged outline of the crest. More probably it comes from the Arabic sehrali, \" wilderness,\" as describing the ban-enness of the Spanish summits."], [187, "Chap. VII. MOUNTAIN-RANGES. 171 Molina at the head of the river of the same name, a tributary of the Tagus, Albarracin between the Tagus and the Guadalaviar, and Cuenca a little more S. (3) The range that separates the plateaus of Old and New Castile may be traced from the Sierra de Moncayo to Cape Roca on the W. coast, the chief links being the Sierras of Somosierra and Guadarama near Madrid, Gredos in the N.E. of Estremadura, Gata between Estremadura and Salamanca, and Estrella in Portugal. (4) The range that subdivides the plateau of New Castile and sepa rates the basins of the Tagus and Guadiana, assumes the names of the Sierras of Toledo S. of Toledo, Guadalupe on the frontier of Toledo and Caceres, Ossa in Alentejo, and Monchique in the S. of Portugal between Algarve and Alentejo. (5) The Sierra Morena forms the S. buttress of the plateau, and divides the basins of the Guadiana and the Guadalquivir. (6) The Sierra Nevada (\" snowy mountains \") runs parallel to the Mediterranean S. of Granada, and is prolonged west ward in the ranges of Alhama and Eonda. The Pyrenees are not, as they at first sight appear, a continuous line : the Central and Western divisions form one line, and the Eastern an other, the former being about 30 m. more to the S. than the latter. The southern range commences with the massive Malade'ta, on which is the Pic de Nethou (11,168 ft.), the culminating point of the whole range; more W. is Monte Perdido (10,994 ft.) with its sister heights Cylindro and Marbore (10,950 ft.). All these fall within the limits of Spain. The range declines from the central section in each direction ; the Eastern division rises at points to a great elevation, as in Moncal (10,653 ft.) E. of Andorre, and in Canigou (9141 ft.). The Pyrenees are more rugged on the Spanish than on the French side. There are good carriage roads at each extremity of the range, E. between Per pignan and Figueras, W. between Bayonne and Vitoria. The passes are so numerous that the Moors called the range Albort, \" the Range of Gates.\" The most famous and frequented are the Ports of \u2014 Maya between Pampeluna and Bayonne ; Roncesvalles between Pampeluna and St. Jean Pied-de-Port ; Canfranc between Jaca and Ole'ron ; Brecha-de-Roland at the head of the valley of Gavarnie ; and Perche at the head of the river Segre. Of the other mountains, the Sierra Nevada is the most remarkable : the range is of no great length, but contains 7 peaks rising above 10,000 ft., the loftiest being Mulahacen (11,660 ft.), and the next highest the Pichaoho de Veleta (11,387 ft.), separated from the former by a remarkable depression, the Corral de Veleta, filled by the glacier which feeds the Jenil. The snow-line on Nevada lies at 9500 ft. The southern spurs of the Nevada range, named the Alpujarras, abound with romantic scenery and descend by terraces to the Mediterranean coast. The Sierra Morena descends steeply on the side of the Guadal quivir, but resolves itself into a series of slight elevations on the side of the Guadiana: it is a wild and deserted region with numerous valleys running up to the plateau from the low basin: its principal heights are situated near Pedroches N.E. from Cordova, and at Arace'ua N.W. from Seville. The high road from Madrid reaches the Andalusian plain by the pass of Desp<5ha-Perros. The great central range that divides the I 2"], [188, "172 THE IBERIAN PENINSULA. Book I. plateaus attains its greatest elevation in the Pico de Penalara (8222 ft.) of the Sierra Guadarama, N.W. from Madrid. The Somosierra is crossed by tbe road between Burgos and Madrid : the pass is the key of the capital from the N. The whole of the central range is wild and rugged. The Sierra de Gredos attains a height of 10,552 ft., and Sierra de Estrella of 7520 ft. : a peculiarity in the latter range is the number of springs contained in many of the summits, which are consequently designated Cantaros or \"jugs.\" The mountains of Asturias iu some instances exceed the limits of perpetual snow. Tha Pena de Penaranda N.W. from Leon rises to nearly 11,000 ft. The Cantabrian range, though not so lofty as the Pyrenees, is very wild and impracticable. \u00a7 5. Hydrography. \u2014 The Iberian peninsula has two slopes of primary importance, but of very unequal size ; tbe larger one W. and S.W. to the Atlantic, and the smaller one S.E. to the Mediterranean. The former contains 4 out of the 5 largest rivers1 \u2014 viz., the Douro, the Tagus, the Guadiana, and the Guadalquivir ; the Ebro is the only one of large size on the S.E. slope. The watershed between these slopes follows generally the line of the Iberian groups, curving round from the Cantabrian Mountains to the Sierra Nevada. In some instances the headwaters of rivers flowing in opposite directions are in close proximity ; thus, for instance, the Guadiana, the Guadarmeno, a branch of the Guadalquivir, and the Madera, a tributary of the Segura, rise at the base of the same mountain near Alcaraz ; and again the Tagus, the Guadalaviar, the Jucar, and its branch the Cabriel, rise in the Muela de S. Juan, near Albarracin. But more generally the headwaters of the rivers are found on the plateaus at considerable intervals, and with no decided elevations between them. Another peculiarity in the hydrography of the peninsula is that the ranges forming the rims of the plateaus are not ahvays watersheds. The Sierra Morena, for instance, is pierced by several tributaries of the Guadalquivir. The rivers of the plateaus are generally shallow, and conduce little to commercial intercourse. The Guadalquivir, fed by the snows of the Nevada, has a greater volume than the rest. The lengths and basin-areas of the chief rivers have been already given (cap. i. \u00a7 11). We now add some descriptive particulars. The Tagus (Span. Tajo ; Port. Tejo), rises on the Muela de San Juan ; crosses the plateau with a rapid stream in a deep bed ; has sterile banks except at Aranjuez, the \"Garden of Castile : \" below Alcantara is navi gable for barges, and below Abrantes for vessels : expands for 30 m. above Lisbon into a broad lake, and again contracts before entering the ocean. Its tributaries are, \u2014 right, the Molina; the Jarama with the Henares, and the Manzanares, which flows by Madrid ; the Alberche ; the A'lagon from Sierra de Gregos ; and the Zezere from the Sierra de Estrella in Portugal : left, the Guadiela, in its upper course ; and the 1 The frequent prefix Guad in the names of the Spanish rivers is a corruption of the Arabic irad: thus Guadalquiver = Wad-al-Kebir, \"the great river;\" and Gua diana = \" Wad-i-Anas,\" t'.e. the classical name Anas with the prefix"], [189, "Chap. VII. HYDROGRAPHY. 173 Zatas, in Portugal. The Douro (Span. Duero), rises on the plateau of Soria: is diverted from its general westerly course to a southerly for about 60 m. on the frontier of Portugal : navigable from Torre de Mon corvo, at the confluence of the Sabor : liable to violent floods at times. Its tributaries :\u2014 right, the Pisuerga, with the Arlanzon and the Carrion ; the Esla ; and in Portugal the Sabor, the Tua, and the Tamega : left, the Eresma ; the Tonnes from the Sierra de Gredos ; the Agueda, on the Portuguese frontier; and the Coa in Portugal!

Mayor, and reaching the sea between a marshland called La Marisma on the W., and a sandy waste on the E. : it is navigable for ships to Seville, and for boats to Cordova. Chief tributary \u2014 left, the Jenil, from the Sierra Nevada, with the Darro of Granada. The Ebro rises in the angle formed by the Cantabrian mountains and the Iberian groups ; traverses in its early course a rugged highland, with a rapid fall ; between Haro and Tude'la its stream moderate and its channel open, but below the latter town hemmed in by mountain spurs and with a very troubled course through an arid district : gorges beset its lower course, emerging from which it crosses the fertile Huerta de Tortosa and its own sandy delta to the sea. Navigation throughout difficult : from Tudela to below Saragossa the Imperial Canal follows its right bank. Its tributaries \u2014 left, the Aragon, the Galle'go, and the Segre, from the Pyrenees ; right, the Jalon and the Guadalupe. Of the minor rivers we may notice : the Minho, in the N.W., com posed of two branches, the Sil and the Upper Minho, whose courses are divided by the Sierra Penamarella and its spurs : enters a fertile plain at Orense, and forms in part the boundary between Spain and Portugal. The Mondego, between the Douro and the Tagus. The Sadao, S. of the Tagus, flowing northwards from the Sierra de Monchique. The Tinto, between the Guadiana and the Guadalquivir. The Segura, which de scends from the highlands of Murcia to the Mediterranean, between Capes Palos and St. Martin. The Jucar, with the Cabriel, which rises on the west side of the Much de San-Juan, and descends S.W. and S. into the plateau of New Castile, tdiere it encroaches on the basin of the Guadiana ; then turns sharply rctund E. to the plain of Valencia. The Guadalaviar or Turia, rising on the opposite side of San-Juan, and de scending in a more direct course to the sea.

Climate and Vegetation. \u2014 The climate and vegetation of the Iberian peninsula exhibit (as might be expected from its confer-"], [190, "THE IBERIAN PENINSULA. Book I. 174 mation) a wide range of variety. No less than 5 climatic regions may be distinguished :\u2014 (1) The maritime region of the north and west coasts, which is distinguished by humidity and equability. The annual rainfall at Bilbao on the N. coast amounts to 100 inches, and at Coimbra on the W. coast to IU inches. The vegetation of this district is thoroughly European, consisting of oaks, chestnuts, &c. (2) The central plateau region, which is remarkably dry and subject to extremes of temperature. The rainfall does not exceed 10 inches, and occurs chiefly in September. The vegetation of this region is scanty and monotonous ; evergreen oaks and chestnuts occur in parts, but large districts have only shrubs and long grass. Cultivation is confined to the margins of streams, or wherever irri gation is possible. (3) The basin of the Guadalquivir, with ex cessive heat in summer, and beautifully mild winters. No rain falls between June and October, but during the other months there is a sufficiency, and the snows of the Sierra Nevada feed the streams. This region produces fine crops of wheat, and is favourable to the vine. (4) The southern maritime region, which is African both in tem perature and vegetation. Snow and frost are unknown, and the proximity of the sea tempers the summer heat. About 20 inches of rain fall, chiefly in spring and autumn. Rice, maize, the olive and the orange, the cotton-plant, sugar-cane, and date-palm, inter mingle with productions of a European character. (5) The basin of the Ebro, which in the interior approximates to the climate of the central region, being variable and severe, but along the sea-coast has a sub-African climate. The following table exhibits the tempera tures of each of these zones : \u2014 \u00a7 7. Ethnology \u2014 Historical Geography. \u2014 The Iberian penin sula is divided between the two kingdoms of Spain and Portugal. The absence of a natural boundary, and the presence of open high ways of communication between these two countries by means of the river-courses, are observable features. The boundary line is very irregular ; it coincides with the lower courses of the Minho in the N.W., and of the Guadiana in the S.E., and occasionally touches the Guadiana, the Tagus, and the Douro in the E. The population of both countries is composed of the same ethnological elements, being Region. Place. Mean Annual. Winter. Summer. 1 2 3 4 6 Lisbon Maelrid ?

Celtic) in its original basis, but with a large and pre ponderating infusion of Gothic blood, and a further admixture of Moorish immigrants. The first of these elements exists in the greatest purity in the Basque provinces and Navarre ; the last in the southern provinces of Spain and Portugal, but particularly in the valleys of the Sierra Morena and Alpujarras, where from 60,000 to 70,000 are known as Moriscos. The Maragatoes are a peculiar race, living about Astorga,, and devoted to the business of carrying goods : their origin is doubtful. The Gypsies (Gitanos) number about 50,000. The languages of Spain and Portugal are both founded on the Latin, and differ only dialectically, the Portuguese being more addicted to nasal and sibilant sounds than the Spanish. The nation ality of the two peoples is identical, but their separation has pro duced a complete alienation of feeling between them. Spain retains the ethnic title, while Portugal derives its name from a town, Portus Cede, now Oporto. Historical Geography. \u2014 On the disruption of the Roman Empire, tbe Peninsula became the prey of the northern tribes, the Vandals settling in Andalusia, and the Visigoths occupying the rest of the country, with Toledo for their capital subsequently to 585. In 711 the Moors entered under Tarek, overthrew the Visigoth empire, and brought all, with the exception of the northern mountainous region, under the Khalifate of the Ommiyades. In 755 Abd-errahman, the survivor of the house of Ommiyah, established his independence in Spain, with Cordova for his capital. Meanwhile the Christian Goths were sustain ing their independence in the north, and gradually advanced their power by the establishment of the states of Leon in 750, Navarre in 858, Castile in 762, and Arragon in 1035. In 1031 the Khalifate of Cordova became dislocated by internal dissension, and a struggle com menced between the Christians and Moors, which resulted in the Moors Jeing confined to the kingdom of Granada in 1238, and in their final ex pulsion from the Peninsula in 1492. The crowns of Castile and Arragon had already been united in 1479 by the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, and the annexation of Navarre in 1512 brought the kingdom into its present form. The independence of Portugal dates from 1095, when Henry of Burgundy was constituted Count of it by Alfonso VI. of Leon. In 1139 his son Alfonso became king. In 1580 Portugal was attached to Spain, but in 1640 she recovered her position under the House of Braganza. I. Spain (Span. Espana; Fr. Espagne ; Germ. Spanien). \u00a7 8. Natural Resources of Spain. \u2014 The physical features of the country having been already sufficiently described in the fore going sections, we pass at once to its resources, its population, and its topography. The natural resources of Spain are ample, but from a variety of causes they are but partially developed. The mineral wealth is very great : gold is no longer found in any quantities, but silver and lead are largely extracted in Murcia and Andalusia, and there are valuable mines of quicksilver at Almaden in the Sierra"], [192, "THE IBERIAN PENINSULA.\u2014 SPAIN. Book I. 176 Morena, and of salt at Minglanilla in Cuenca, and at Cardona in Catalonia. In the Asturian mountains are coal and iron, but the amount produced is very limited ; coal is also found near Seville. Agriculture is the main resource of the inhabitants ; and in spite of the large amount of land (nearly half of the whole area) which is uncultivated and, for the most part, uncultivable in consequence of the drought, Spain produces cereals more than sufficient for her own population. The most fertile districts are the huertas (from the Latin hortus) or \" gardens \" of the eastern coast, and the basin of the Guadalquivir. The vine is largely grown about the southern coast, and supplies the staple export of the country : the chief seats of the wine manufacture are Jerez (whence our word \" Sherry \") and Rota near Cadiz, Montilla near Cordova, Valdepenas in La Mancha, Malaga on the S. coast, and Alicante on the S.E. Malaga and Ali cante are also famed for their raisins. Silk is produced in the S. and S.E. The central plateaus are mostly pasture-grounds, and in Old Castile and Leon a breed of sheep exists which produces the Valuable merino wool. We may further notice the horses of Anda lusia, and the mules of the rest of Spain ; and among the special products, barilla, whence carbonate of soda is extracted, grown in Murcia ; liquorice, produced about Seville and the lower Ebro ; and cork, the bark of the quercus suber, which grows in the S. Spain suffers much from neglect of her forests, which now occupy only 5-52 per cent, of the area ; the absence of foliage is one of the causes of the desiccation of the central district. \u00a7 9. Population \u2014 Government, &c. \u2014 The population of Spain is on the increase, but is insignificant compared with its amount in by-gone ages. Its fluctuations have been remarkable ; in the Moorish period it numbered from 30 to 40 millions ; in the early part of the 16th century it had sunk to 16 millions, and at the close of the 17th century to 8 millions. In the present century it has varied from 11 to about 16 millions, the exact numbers in 1864 being 15,752,607. The northern and north-eastern provinces are most densely popu lated. The character and bearing of the Spaniard vary in different parts of the country, and this to such an extent as to produce an inveterate animosity between the several sections. The Castilian is haughty, well-bred, and indolent; the Arragonese, rough, sturdy, and dogged ; the Andalusian, swaggering and mendacious ; the Asturian and the Galician, simple and independent. All are con spicuous for patriotism and endurance, virtues which history illus trates in the record of sieges sustained, from Numantia down to Saragossa ; among their defects must be mentioned pride and reli gious intolerance. The Spaniards retain numerous national customs, among which we may notice the bull-fight as their chief public amusement ; the mantilla as the distinctive article of female attire ;"], [193, "Chap. Vis. POPULATION-GOVERNMENT, &c. 177 the olla podrida and the puehero (both of them kinds of hotch potch) as their favourite dishes ; the guitar and castanets as their musical instruments ; and the bolero as their dance. Government, Religion, and Education. \u2014 The Government of Spain is a constitutional monarchy. The nation is represented by a Cortes or parliament of two Chambers, viz., a Senate, composed of high officials, hereditary nobility, and 200 nominees of the sovereign ; and a Chamber of deputies, elected by the nation at the rate of a deputy for 35,000 inhabitants. The executive power is vested in the sovereign, who acts through Ministers, and is aided by a Council of State. The Roman Catholic religion alone is tolerated, and is professed by nearly the whole of the population. Spain has been up to the present time a priest ridden country, but some effectual steps have been taken to reduce the power of the Church. In 1836 no less than 884 out of 1940 then exist ing monastic establishments were suppressed, and their estates confis cated : in 1857 a further reduction was effected : and in 1859 a concordat was obtained by which the whole landed property of the Church was permitted to be sold. The sum already obtained from the sale of church lands amounts to 30 millions sterling. Education has mean while progressed rapidly : in 1803 only 1 in 340 of the population was under instruction, now 1 in 15 is. The military power of Spain has revived in a remarkable degree within the last 20 years, but her finances are still in an embarrassed state. Agriculture, Manufactures, and Commerce. \u2014 Agriculture is the leading occupation of the Spaniards; but the methods are antiquated and un scientific. The culture of the vine, and of the tropical plants and fruits already noticed, together with the rearing of the silkworm, are followed in the southern and south-eastern provinces. Manufactures are insigni ficant : we may notice that of oigars at Seville as in a flourishing state, and the textile products of Catalonia, including cotton, woollen, and silk stuffs, as progressing. The swords of Toledo have been ever famous, and the former supremacy of Spain in leather-work is testified by the word \" cordwainer,\" derived from Cordova \u2014 an art in which the Spaniards still excel. Iron is chiefly manufactured in the Basque provinces and Asturias. The exports of Spain consist of wine, oil, brandy, fruits, lead, and salt : the imports, of colonial produce, cotton and woollen stuffs, salt fish, iron, coal, and timber. In point of value the imports exceed the exports by nearly one-half. The commercial marine of Spain amounted in 1861 to 9707 ships with a tonnage of 443,000. Communications. \u2014 The roads of Spain are proverbially bad. The royal roads that radiate from Madrid to Irun, Barcelona, Cadiz, Granada, Junquera, Corunna, Oviedo, and Badajos, are well engineered but badly kept. Canals are few and inoperative, because unfinished or out of repair : the chief ones are the Imperial Canal of Arragon, pro jected by Charles I. in 1528, which accompanies the Ebro from Sara gossa to Tudela, and the canal of Castile, designed to connect Segovia and Reinosa, which was commenced in 1753, but is only completed between Valladolid and Alar del Rey. The railroad system is in pro gress, and the mileage at work amounts to 2227 m. Lines radiate from Madrid S.E. to Alicante, with a branch to Valencia ; E. to Saragossa and Barcelona ; N. by Avila and Valladolid to Bayonne and Santander ; N.W. to Leon and Zamora, by lines that branch off from the one just mentioned ; W. to Badajoz and Lisbon (nearly complete) ; and S. to Cordova < nearly complete), Seville, and Cadiz. i 3"], [194, "178 THE IBERIAN PENINSULA.\u2014 SPAIN. Book I. \u00a7 10. Political Divisions. \u2014 Spain is divided into 47, or, in cluding the Balearic Isles and the Canaries, which rank as integral portions of Spain, into 49 provinces. This arrangement is generally referred to the period of French domination, but it seems to have grown up at an earlier period (about 1780). The names of these provinces are derived from those of their chief towns, with the ex ception of Navarre and the Basque provinces, where the old titles are still used indifferently with the more modern ones. The old historical division into kingdoms, principalities, &c, of which there were 13 in all, still remains in ordinary use, and is therefore given in the subjoined table. The names of these old territories deserve attention, inasmuch as they represent in several instances the most important periods of Spanish history. Thus in the names of the mountainous provinces of the north \u2014 Basque, Asturias, and Galicia \u2014 we recognise the old Iberian tribes of the Vascones, the Assures, and the Oallaeci. Leon (a shortened form of Legio) commemorates the Roman period; Catalonia (s.e. Ooih- Alan-id), the irruption of the northern tribes ; Andalusia (from Andalos, the Moorish name for the peninsula generally, as being occupied by the Vandals at the time when they entered it), the Moorish dominion, and its restriction in later times to the south ; Castile (from castellum, \" fortress \"), the advancing power of the Christian kings, who erected a number of forts for the defence of their conquests ; and Estremadura (i. e. extrema ora, the \" extreme boundary \"), the farthest advance of Alfonso IX. in 1228. 1 The population of the towns is taken from the census of 1857. The census of 1860, the results of which are not yet fully made known, exhibits so wide a variation in the numbers as to justify a suspicion as to the accuracy of the returns. Thus Madrid is reduced to 298,426 inhabitants, Barcelona to 189,948, Granada to 67,326, Seville to 118,298, and Cordova to 41,963, while Jerez is raised to 52,153, Badajoz to 22,895, &c Old Divisions.

Madrid is an exception to the general rule ; it is a comparatively modern town, its rise dating from the reign of Charles V., and has broad and regularly built streets ; it stands at an elevation of 2412 ft. above the sea, surrounded by an arid plain, the centrality of the position being its chief recommendation ; the climate is unhealthy and disagreeable, being exceedingly dry and liable to extremes of heat and cold. Bar celona is the second town in point of population ; it ranks as the \" Manchester \" of Spain, but its manufactures are on a small scale. Cordova and Seville are the commercial capitals of the rich province of Andalusia ; and we may further notice in the S. Valenoia, seated on a rich plain adjacent to the Mediterranean; Murcia, similarly situated ; Malaga, an active port with a large trade in wine ; and Granada, on the N. side of the Sierra Nevada, the fine old capital of the Moors. In earlier times Cordova had a population of a mil lion, Seville of half a million, and Granada of 400,000. Of the remaining towns we may notice the important sea-port towns of Cadiz in the S., Vigo and Corunna in the N.W., and Santander on the Bay of Biscay : Cadiz is the seat of a naval establishment (dockyard and arsenal), as are also Ferrol in the N.W., and Cartagena in the E. The frontier on the side of France is guarded hy the fortresses of San Sebastian and Pamplona at the W. extremity of the Pyrenees, and Figueras at the E. Universities are numerous; in addition to those at towns already mentioned \u2014 viz., Madrid, Bar celona, Seville, and Valencia, we may notice under this head Sara gossa, Toledo, Huesca, Salamanca, Santiago, Valladolid, and Oviedo. The Spanish towns are generally furnished with a public promenade, shaded by trees, and called alameda (from the alamo, or \" elm-tree \"). In regard to architectural style, the most remarkable feature is the juxta-position of African and European, Mohammedan and Christian buildings, combined not unfrequently with the massive tokens of Eoman dominion in bridges and other edifices.

The group consists of 5 islands, two of con siderable but unequal size, Majorca the larger, and Minorca the lesser (as their names respectively imply) ,- a third, Iviza, much smaller; aud the two islets of Formentara and Cabrera. The aggregate area of the group is 1758 sq. m., and its population 278,600. Iviza and Formen tara are occasionally distinguished by their classical title as the Pityusic islands. The products of the larger islands are wine, oranges, citrons, saffron, and flax ; of the smaller ones sheep and grain. The towns are"], [200, "THE IBERIAN PENINSULA.\u2014 SPAIN. Eook I. 184 Palma (40,514) on Majorca; Port-Mahon (13,102) on Minorca; and Iviza ( 5970') on the isle of the same name. Minorca belonged to the British from 1708 to 1756, to the French from 1756 to 1763, and to the British again from 1763 to 1802. The Canary Islands are a group of 1 2 situated off the W. coast of Africa, between the 27th and 30th parallels of N. lat., and the 13th and 19th meridians of W. long. The 7 chief islands are as follows:\u2014 Palma aud Ferro in the W. ; Gomera ; Teneriffe and Canary in the centre ; Fuerteventura and Lanzarote iu the N.E. The aggregate area of these is 2806 sq m., and the population 277,146.

Palmas (12,000!, in Canary, ranks as the capital; and Santa Cruz (9000), in Teneriffe, as the chief port. Laguna (6532) is on a high plateau in the interior of Teneriffe.

The total popula tion, white and coloured, of tbe Spanish colonies is estimated at about 4J millions. \u00a7 12. Gibraltar \u2014 Andorre. \u2014 Within the geographical limits of Spain are two spots which are politically independent of her, viz. : \u2014 the fortress of Gibraltar in the extreme S., which belongs to Great Britain, and the independent, or, more properly, neutral republic of Andorro in the N.E. Gibraltar stands on a remarkable rock, which rises to the height of 1430 ft., and has a length of 3 m., projecting south wards from the mainland of Spain. Its modern name is derived from Tarik (Qibel-al-Tarik, \" Tarik's hill \"), the Arab conqueror of Spain in 711. It was recovered from the Moors first in 1309, and finally in 1462, and was incorporated with the Spanish kingdom in 1502. It was captured by the English under Sir George Rooke in 1704, and has been retained by them ever since in spite of attempts to recover it in 1727, and again in the memorable siege of 1779-1783. Its value to Great Britain is immense, as securing to her a com manding position in reference to Spain and the Mediterranean, and also as a dep6t for coal, military stores, and articles of commerce. The defences are of great strength, and include galleries excavated in the solid rock. The rock is enlivened with verdure in the spring and autumn, but at other periods is bare and brown. The town stands on the W. side of the rock, and contains a population (ex clusive of the garrison) of 15,426. The Republic of Andorre is situated on the S. side of the Pyrenees in the valley of the Balira, and adjacent to the French department of Ariege. It is a secluded and very picturesque region about 37 m. long by 30 m. wide, well-wooded, rich in iron ore, and with a severe climate. The Spanish Bishop of Urgel exercises a nominal sovereignty over it ; but the executive is vested in two presidents (yeguers), appointed the one by the French emperor and the other by the Bishop of Urgel. A council of 24 members, presided over by a syndic, completes the constitution of this miniature republic, which has retained its separate existence since the time of Louis le De\"bon naire. The chief town is of the same name as the valley. The people are occupied in iron-making and smuggling. II. Portugal. \u00a7 13. Character and Resources of Portugal. \u2014 The leading physical features of Portugal have been already described in the"], [202, "THE IBERIAN PENINSULA.\u2014 PORTUGAL. Book I. 186 opening paragraphs of this chapter. The country may be regarded as the slope of the plateau region which descends by irregular terraces to the ocean. It is seamed with mountain ranges, between which are extensive plains, for the most part of a sandy and healthy cha racter. The scenery is frequently very picturesque, particularly in the valleys of the Minho, the Mondego, and the Guadiana, and about parts of the Douro. The province of Traz-os-Montes is wild, Alem t^jo dull, and Algarve sandy. Wine is pre-eminently the product of Portugal : from the vineyards on the upper Douro comes the port wine which is so named from its place of shipment, Oporto. The neighbourhood of Lisbon produces Bueellas, Careavellos, and other less celebrated wines. Fruit is abundant and of the finest quality \u2014 olives, oranges, lemons, citrons, &c. Salt, produced from lagoons, is another important product, of which Setub&l (St. Ube's, as the English sailors call it) is the chief port of export. Grain is pro duced in quantities barely sufficient for home consumption. Wool is largely exported. \u00a7 14. Population \u2014 Government, &c. \u2014 The population of Por tugal has increased considerably within the last, century, but is still far below what it was some four or five centuries back : in 1863 it amounted to 3,987,861. Agriculture forms the chief occupation of the country : mining is almost unknown : and manufactures are still insufficient for the home demand. The government is a constitutional monarchy, with a Cortes consisting, as in Spain, of 2 chambers\u2014 a house of Peers, who are nominated by the sovereign, and a house of Deputies elected by the country. Roman Catholicism is the established religion ; but all forms are tolerated. The monastic esta blishments have been, with a few exceptions, suppressed. Educa tion is carried on by the state without much effect. Railways have been constructed from Lisbon to the Guadiana by Abrantes and Elvas ; and to Beja. \u00a7 15. Political Divisions, &c. \u2014 Portugal was formerly divided into six provinces, the names of which were derived from their geo graphical position thus : \u2014 Entre-Douro-e-Minho \" between the Douro and Minho ;\" Traz-os-Montes \" the other side of the mountains,\" viz., of Marao, to one living near the coast ; Beira, the \" border,\" perhaps as skirting the coast ; Estremadura (already explained in \u00a7 10) ; Alemtejo, \" beyond the Tagus ;\" and Algarve, an Arabic term, \" the west.\" The first and third of these divisions were sub divided into two, thus making eight. There are now 17 provinces, named after their chief towns. We append a table of both divisions in parallel columns with the names of the chief towns : \u2014"], [203, "Chap. VII. POPULATION\u2014 DIVISIONS\u2014 TOWNS. 187 \u00a7 16. Towns \u2014 Islands \u2014 Colonial Possessions. \u2014 The towns of Portugal are generally poor both in population and in architectural monuments. Lisbon, the capital, has a preponderating population as compared with the rest : it is beautifully situated on the N. bank of the Tagus, just where it narrows to the channel connecting the lake-like expanse of the river with the sea : it has a magnificent natural harbour and is surrounded with picturesque scenery : the town suffered severely by the earthquake of 1755, and is deficient in old buildings of interest. The royal palaces, and the aqueduct of white marble, are the most note-worthy objects. Next to Lisbon comes Oporto, \" the port,\" as the name means, of the original Portugal, at the mouth of the Douro, and the chief place of export for the wine district of the north. Braga, in the N., the seat of the primacy, the thriving port of Setubal S. of Lisbon, the fortress of Elvas facing that of Badajoz in Spain, and reputed the strongest fortress in the. world, and Evora, the centre of a large district W. of the Guadiana, have populations of 15,000 or upwards. Coimbra is the seat of the University of Portugal. We may further notice the frontier fortresses of Almeida facing Ciudad Eodrigo in Spain, and Valenoa on the Minho. The most remarkable buildings in Portugal are perhaps the monastic establishments, some of which are of extraordinary size : those of Alcobaca and Thomar may be instanced. The palaces are also large, particularly that of Mafra, N.W. of Lisbon. Among the few specimens of ecclesiastical architecture may be specified the Church of Belem founded in 1500, Batalha Church with magnificent cloisters and mortuary chapel, and the Cathedral of Braga.

The Madeira group lies between 32\u00b0 23' and 33\u00b0 8' N. lat., 16\u00b0 and 16\u00b030' W. long. , and consists of Madeira itself, Porto Santo, and the three Desertas. Madeira has a length of 31 m. ; is of volcanic origin, with precipitous coasts, lofty mountains (Pico Ruivo 6000 ft.), fertile soil, wonderfully equable temperature ranging between 63\u00b0 and 73 \u00b0, and fine scenery. The vineyards have suffered much of late years from the oidium, and the vine has been to a certain extent supplanted by the sugar-cane and coffee-plant. Madeira has long been the resort of con sumptive patients. Funchal, the capital, has a population of about 30,000, \u00bbnd the whole group one of 112,164. The Azores or Western Isles, are a group lying between 36\u00b0 55' and 39\u00b0 44' N. lat., 25J 10' and 31\u00b0 16' W. long., and consisting of 9 islands, of which St. Michael is the largest, with a total area of 1147 sq. m., and a population of 249,941. They are of volcanic origin; contain lofty peaks (Pico, 7613 ft.): produce excellent oranges and other fruits, wine, &c. ; and have a moist and variable climate.

It lies between 42\u00b0 20' and 51\u00b0 C N. lat., and 4\u00b0 48' W. and 8\u00b0 15' E. long., thus stretching through about 8J degrees of latitude and 13 of longitude. Its extreme points are : \u2014 N, a point on the British"], [206, "Book I 190 FRANCE. Channel, about midway between Dunkirk and Nieuport; S., the Pyrenees, in 2\u00b0 30' E. long. ; W., C. St. Mathieu, near Brest ; and E., the confluence of the Lauter with the Bhine. . It is bounded in three directions by the sea \u2014 viz., W. by the Bay of Biscay ; N.W. by the English Channel ; and S.E. by the Mediterranean. From Spain, in the S.W., it is separated by the Pyrenees ; from Italy, in the S.E., by the Alps, and by a line which reaches the sea just E. of Mentone ; from Switzerland, by a line which leaves the Alps at the E. flank of Mont Blanc for the lake of Geneva, follows the S. side of that lake nearly to its W. end, circumvents the canton of Geneva, and then follows Jura, the river Doubs, and an irregular line to the Rhine, near Basle; from Baden, in the E., by the Rhine; and from Rhenish Bavaria, Rhenish Prussia, and Belgium, in the N.E., by a conventional line which leaves the Rhine at the confluence of the Lauter, and strikes the North Sea near Dunkirk. In shape France resembles a pentagon, with its sides facing in the directions just in dicated. The distance between the extreme N. and S. points is 608 m., and between the extreme E. and W. points, 580 miles ; the extreme length diagonally from C. St. Mathieu to Mentone is about 720 m. The area (Corsica excluded) is 208,054 sq. m., and the population 37,219,843. Historical Geography. \u2014 The separate existence of France dates from 843, when the great Frankish Empire broke up. The country was then parcelled out into a number of territories, the lords of which accorded to the kings a feudal supremacy. France has obtained her present dimensions by the gradual accretion of those fiefs around the nucleus supplied by the domain of Hugh Capet, Duke of France (i.e. of Isle-de-France and Orleanais), who was raised to the sovereignty in 987. The first important acquisition was the Duchy of Berri, which was purchased by Philip I. in 1100, from its proprietor Count Herpin. In the latter part of the 12th cent., the kings of England owned a much larger portion of France than the titular kings of France ; but the Examples.

HISTORICAL AND MILITARY GEOGRAPHY. 191 balance of power was altered by the acquisition, on the part of Philip Augustus, of Touraine, Anjou, Maine, and Poitou in 1202, and of Normandy in 1204. The same king conquered Auvergne in 1209 ; but this was subsequently given as an appanage, and was not finally united to the crown until the reign of Louis XIII. Languedoc fell to the crown in 1270, through the extinction of the reigning family. Cham pagne was annexed iu 1285, on the accession of Philip IV., who had received it as his wife's inheritauce. Dauphiny was purchased in 1342 by Philip VI. from its last count. Limousin was conquered from the English in 1370; and Guyenne and Gascony, in 1453. Burgundy and Picardy lapsed to the crown on the death of Charles the Bold in 1477, and Provence on the extinction ofthe ruling family in 1481. Brittany was acquired by the successive marriages of Charles VIII. in 1491 Louis XII. in 1499, and Francis I. in 1514, with the heiresses of that duchy, and was finally incorporated in 15.32. The reign of Louis XIV. witnessed the following important acquisitions : \u2014 Alsace, from Austria in 1IJ48 by the Peace of Westphalia ; Rousillon and Artois, from Spain in 1659 by the Peace ofthe Pyrenees; French Flanders, from Austria in 1668 by tbe Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle ; Franche Comte', from Spain in 1678 by the Peace of Niemeguen ; Strasbourg, bv seizure in lb88 ; and Orange, from Prussia in 1713 by the Peace of Utrecht. Lorraine fell in ou the death of Stanislas Leczinsky in 1766. Corsica was ceded by the Genoese in 1 768. Avignon was detached from the Papal power in 1791. Nice and Savoy were ceded in 1860 by the then king of Sardinia; and the territory of Monaco (exclusive of the town) was obtained by purchase in 1860. INDEX TO SKETCH MAP. 1. Dnnlrirfe. 2.

Military Geography \u2014 A glance at the map of France will show that, while on four of her sides her frontier is well protected either by the sea or by lofty mountain-ranges, on the fifth (the north-east) she lies open to the adjacent countries. In this direction, therefore, she can most readily assail and be assailed ; and towards this quarter her mili-"], [208, "192 FRANCE, Book I. tary arrangements are chiefly directed. The nature of the frontier deserves attention : the district between the English Channel and the Schelde is a dead flat, and is naturally an open gate between France and Belgium : between tbe Schelde and the Meuse it is still low and open, but broken by ravines and varied by bills of moderate height, and partially wooded : between the Meuse and the Moselle the same cha racter of country prevails, but with increasing ruggedness: east of the Moselle the Vosges form the natural boundary ; but France oversteps this to the Rhine, and has thus free access to Germany. The low and open frontier above described is crossed by rivers, running for the moat part perpendicularly to it, and which serve as natural routes across it, viz. \u2014 the Lys, the Schelde, the Sambre, the Meuse, and the Moselle. These rivers interlace with another series of rivers, which converge towards Paris from various points between the sources of the Sambre and the Moselle, viz. : the Oise, tbe Aisne, the Marne, and the Aube. This whole district is therefore admirably adapted for strategetical operations, and has witnessed more fighting than all the rest of France put together. The line of the Lys and the Schelde was the scene of Marlborough's campaigns in 1708-11 ; this section of the frontier is, however, heavily defended, and gives less scope for strategy than the adjacent line of the Schelde and the Sambre, which has been the scene of operations on three occasions, viz. : in 1712 by the Allies under the Duke of Ormond and Prince Eugene ; in 1793 by the Austrians ; and in 1814 by a division of the Allies. The line of the Sambre and Meuse was followed by the Allies iu 1814 in their advance on Paris; and the line of the Meuse and Moselle by the Prussians in 1792. The French crossed the frontier between the Schelde and the Sambre in the cam paigns of 1688, 1740, 1794, and 1815. The rivers that converge towards Paris furnished the lines by which the allied armies advanced in 1814 \u2014 the Austrians by the Seine, the army of Silesia by the Marne, and the army of the North by the Oise. The defences on the side of France are as follows : \u2014 In the extreme N. a network of canals and the possibi lity of flooding the low country about Dunkirk are important auxil iaries ; but both there and all along the frontier, fortresses are thickly planted, and when viewed connectedly will be found to form parallel lines. On tbe sea-coast are the fortified ports of Dunkirk, Gravelines, and Calais; between the coast and the Lys, Bergues and St. Omer; on the Lys, St. Venant and Aire ; between the Lys and the Schelde, Lille (the key of the north), Be'thune, Douai, and Arras; on the Schelde, Conde, Valenciennes, Boucbain, and Cambrai ; between the Schelde and the Sambre, Le Quesnoy ; on the Sambre, Maubeuge and Landrecies; between the Sambre and the Meuse, Avesnes and Rocroi ; on the Meuse, Givet, Mezieres, Sedan, and Verdun ; between the Meuse and the Moselle, Montme'dy and Longwy; on the Moselle, Thionville, Metz (the chief fortress of the Meuse section), and Toul ; in the Vosges, Bitche and Phalsbourg ; and in tbe Rhine valley, Lauterbourg, 'Weis sembourg, Hagenau, and Strasbourg (the chief fortress of France on the Rhine). Between the frontier line and Paris, there is an interme diate line, consisting of Abbeville, Amiens, and Peronne, ou the Somme; Guise and La Fere, on the Oise ; Laon, between the Oise and the Aisne ; and Soissons, on the Aisne. Looking to the other approaches to France we may briefly notice that the Rhone valley is guarded by Besaneon and Lyons, the Alps by Grenoble and Brianijon, and the Pyrenees by Perpignan and Bayonne."], [209, "CllAP. VIII. COASTS AND HARBOURS. 193 \u00a7 2. Coasts. \u2014 France possesses an extended seaboard on its N.W., W., and S. sides. The value of the extent is, however, much im paired by the regularity of the coast line, which both reduces the mileage and deprives long sections of their fair share of harbourage. The total length, including the minor sinuosities, is about 1500 m., and excluding them, about 1200 m. The most marked features in the outline are : \u2014 the peninsula of Cotentin, on the N. coast ; the pro truding extremity of Brittany, in the N.W. ; the symmetrical sweep of the Bay of Biscay ; and the double curve of the coast of the Medi terranean, a concave one W. of Marseilles, coinciding with the Gulf1 of Lions, and a convex one E. of Marseilles to the boundary of Italy. Of the minor features we may notice on the N. coast \u2014 the promontory of Grisuez, between Calais and Boulogne ; the estuaries of the Somme and the Seine ; the bays on each side of the peninsula of Cotentin, viz. : E. the Bay of the Seine, and W. the Bay of St. Malo ; the Bay of St. Brieuc; and the promontory of Sillon. On the W. coast \u2014 the promontories of St. Mathieu and Eaz Point, with the intervening Bays of Brest and Douarnenez ; Audierne Bay, between Raz Point and Fenmarch ; Blavet and Morbihan Bays ; the estuaries of the Loire and the Gironde ; and the Bassin d'Arcachon, which is the solitary opening between the Gironde and the Pyrenees. The character of the coast varies, the most notice able points being the sandhills that fringe it in the N., the ruggedness of the N.W. (Brittany), the remarkable regularity and the sandhills of the S.W. (Gascony and Guienne), and the lagunes in the S. from the Pyrenees to the Rhone. A series of islands fringes the coast of the Bay of Biscay as far S. as the Gironde, the chief from N. to S. being Ushant, Belle-Isle, Noirmoutier, Yeu, Be, and Oleron. \u00a7 3. Harbours. \u2014 The harbourage is not proportioned to the extent of the seaboard. On the N. coast, Cherbourg on the Cotentin is the best harbour, being capacious and well protected with a break water (digue) ; Dunkirk has an excellent roadstead, but a poor har bour ; Havre, at the mouth of the Seine, is the chief commercial port on this coast ; of the rest, Calais and Boulogne are artificial ports, adapted for the transit-traffic to England ; St. Valery, at the mouth of the Somme, Dieppe, and Fecamp, are small ; and St. Malo, on the W. of the Cotentin, is dangerous of access from rocks, but well pro tected and commodious. Several of the bays on the N. coast of Brittany offer harbourage, but from their remoteness are applicable only to local commerce. On the W. coast : \u2014 Brest harbour is land locked and capacious ; Lorient, at the head of the Bay of Blavet, is also secure ; the estuary of the Loire has the rising commercial port of St. Nazaire at its mouth, and is navigable for vessels of 200 tons up to Nantes ; the Isle de Re furnishes a roadstead to La Rochelle, and the isles of Aix and Oleron shield the approach to Rochefort on the Charente, and supply, the former particularly, safe anchorage ; the 1 We Bhould prefer to call this the \" Gulf of the Lion,\" which is its true designation (French, Golfe du Lion), in order to avoid confusion with the name Lyons. MOD. GEO. K"], [210, "Eook I. 194 FRANCE. Gironde is navigable throughout, and vessels of 600 tons reach Bor deaux on the Garonne. On the S. coast, Cette is the best port in the Gulf of Lions ; E. of the Rhone are the fine natural harbours of Marseilles and Toulon, which have been further improved and secured by the highest engineering and military skill, the former the first commercial, the latter the first naval port of France. In addition to these there is a safe roadstead at the isles of Hyeres, and ports of secondary calibre at Cannes, Antibes, and Nioe. \u00a7 4. Configuration \u2014 Mountains and Plains. \u2014 (1) A broad belt of lowland crosses France diagonally from the N.E. frontier to the Bay of Biscay, and is continued along the coast of that sea to the Pyrenees. Much of this lowland is flat, particularly the landes, in the S.W., and the low district adjoining West Flanders ; between the Loire and the Seine, and E. of the latter, it is undulating. (2) The lowland is bounded E. and S.E. by a highland, of which the Cevennes and its continuations form the eastern limit. The name of CeVemies is properly restricted to the range that lies between the sources of the Orb in the S.W., and Mont Lozere, or the source of the Lot, in the N. ; the chain is continued in one direction towards the Pyrenees in the Montagnes Noires, terminating in the low ground along which the Languedoc Canal is carried; and in the other direction, in a line of heights running parallel to the Rhone and Saone through the old districts of Vivarais, lyonnais, Beaujolais, and Charolais, after which it is successively called, until it declines at the low ground along which the Canal du Centre is carried between the Saone and the Loire. Returning to the termination of the Cevennes proper, the range forks off in two directions just about the region where the riveis Lot, Allier, and Loire rise ; one branch, under the name of Margeride, strikes off N.W., and forms a connecting link with the Mountains of Auvergne, which separate the basins of the Allier and the Dordogne ; the other, called the Mountains of Forez, proceeds nearly due N. be tween the upper valleys of the Loire and the Allier. (3) The eastern line is resumed beyond the limit to which we have traced it, in the range of Cote d'Or, between the Canals du Centre and de Bourgogne, and N. of the latter in the Plateau of Langres, which extends N. to the districts where the Saone, the Meuse, and the Marne take their rise. There the line divides ; one branch, the Argonnes, proceeds N.W. between the Meuse and the Aisne, and on by a series of lower elevations, including the western slopes of the Ardennes, to C. Grisnez, near Calais ; the other branch bends round the head of the basin of the Saone to the S.E., assuming the name of Fauoilles, \" sickle,\" from its shape, and joins the Vosges, which run parallel to the Ehine, separating its basin from that of the Moselle. (4) E. of the Ce'vennes and its continuations, France possesses the basin of the Bhone as high as Geneva, and the broad plain of its tributary the Saone; K."], [211, "Chap. VIII. CONFIG URATION -HYDROGRAPHY. 195 of the Vosges it has a portion of the upper plain of the Ehine. (5) We have finally to notice the isolated mountains of Brittany in the N.W. angle ; the ranges of Jura, which intervene between France and Switzerland ; the Alps, from Mont Blanc to the Mediterranean, which cover with their spurs Savoy, Dauphiny, and a considerable part of Provence ; and the Pyrenees, which send out their offshoots in a fan like form to the Garonne at Agen. We append some few particulars as to those ranges. In the Alps France possesses, in virtue of her most recent acquisitions, Mont Blanc, the culminating point of the whole range. The Alps of Dauphiny project westward between the Drac and the Romanche, and form a rugged and lofty knot of mountains, of which Les Ecrins and Mont Pelvoux are the culminating points. Another branch, hardly less rugged, projects between the Romanche and Arc. The most important pass into Italy is by Mont Cenis, over the head of which a railway is being constructed in anticipation of the tunnel which is slowly boring the mountain at a point about 6000 ft. below the summit. The Pyre nees have been already described in the last chapter : the highest points on the French side are Vignemale (10,820 ft.), near Cauterets ; Pic du Midi (9540 ft.), near Eaux Chaudes ; and Canigou (9137 ft.) in Rousil lon. The French Pyrenees exhibit a distinctive feature in the semi circular escarpments (locally termed oules, from the Latin olla, \"pot\"), over which the streams fall at immense heights ; that of Gavarnie (1300 ft. high) is depicted in the cut at the head of this chapter. The Cevennes are a wild, desolate, rugged range \u2014 the scene of a most savage war in 1702-4 between the Protestant Camisards and the royal troops : Lozere (4890 ft.) is the highest point in the Ce'vennes proper, but it is overtopped by Mezene (5820 ft.) and Gerbier des Jones (5125 ft.), in the Vivarais range. The Auvergne range connects witb Margeride in the mountain -knot of Plomb-du-Cantal (6095 ft.), and thence proceeds N. to Mont Dore, whose peak, the Puy-de-Sancy (6171 ft.), is the highest in the interior of France. The Auvergne range is continued N. of Mont Dore in the range called the Domes, of which the Puy-de-D6me (4806 ft.) is the highest. Other branches ramify westward between the basins of the Loire and Dordogne, S.W. between the Dordogne and Lot, and N.W. into Limousin : in the latter direction is the plateau of Mille- Vaches, whence the Creuse, Vienne, and Vezere flow towards different quarters. The distinctive feature in the Vosges is the rounded conical shape of many of the summits, whicb the French designate ballons, \"balloons:\" the culminating points are the Balloons of Guebwiller (4690 ft.), and of Alsace (4124 ft.) : the range contains many lakes and marshes. \u00a7 5. Hydrography. \u2014 The most important slope of France is to wards the W., modified, however, by a marked tendency to a north erly trending, in consequence of the position of the heights on which the rivers rise. The watershed between this and the adjacent slopes is formed by the CeVennes, the Cote d'Or, the Plateau of Langres, tbe Argonnes, and the low heights thence to C. Grisnez. The rivers that rise W. of this line have a general tendency towards the N.W., and either reach the Atlantic, as the Garonne and the Loire, or are intercepted by the English Channel, as the Seine and the Somme. K 2"], [212, "196 FRANCE. Book I. The rivers that rise E. of that line partly seek the Mediterranean, as the Rhone with the Saone, and the lesser streams about the Gulf of Lions, and are partly thrown off N.E. towards the basin of the Ehine and the North Sea, as the Moselle, the Meuse with the Sambre, and the Schelde, The watershed between the Saone and the northerly streams lies on the plateau of Langres and the Faucilles. Of the Rhine, the left bank from Basle to the Lauter belongs to France. The basins of the western rivers are on a large scale as compared with the area of the country ; a reference to the statistics in cap. 1, \u00a7 11, will show that the Loire, the Garonne, and the Seine occupy about two fifths of the whole area of France. The basin of the Rhone is the only other of great extent. The occasional depressions of the ground between these several basins form one of the most important fea tures in the hydrography of France, from the facilities thus afforded to canalization : these depressions are marked by the lines of the several canals \u2014 viz., de Languedoc, between the Rhone and the Garonne; du Centre, between the Saone and the Loire; de Bourgogne, between the Sa6ne and the Yonne, a branch of the Seine ; de Briaire, between the Seine and the Loire ; and d'Alsace, between the Sa6ne and the Rhine. The rivers themselves are not altogether favourable to navigation ; the Rhone, from its impetuosity ; the Loire, from its sandbanks and its shallowness ; the Seine, also from sandbanks and meanderings ; and the Garonne, from shallowness. Heavy and de vastating floods occasionally occur in the French rivers. The Loire rises in the Vivarais range, follows in its early course the northerly direction of the mountain ranges, and, reaching the plain, sweeps round N.W. to Orleans, then S.W. and W. to the Bay of Biscay, receiving 1. the Allier, the Cher, and the Vienne with the Creuse, all of which rise in the central highlands and flow towards different points ; and rt. in its lower course, the Mayenne with the Sarthe, and a tribu tary of the Sarthe, the Loir. The Garonne rises in the gap between tbe central and the eastern Pyrenees, and flows N.E. to Toulouse, and thence N.W. to the Gironde, receiving rt. tbe Ariege from the Pyrenees, and the Tarn with the Aveyron, the Lot, and the Dordogne, from the central highlands ; and 1. several rivers of minor importance. The Seine rises on the plateau of Langres, and holds a general N.W. course to the English Channel, receiving 1. the Yonne, the Loing, the Essonne, and the Eure ; rt., the Aube, the Marne, and the Oise with the Aisne. The Rhone has its sources in the Pennine Alps, enters France just below Geneva, flows W. to Lyons, and thence S. to the sea, which it enters by four arms, forming a delta called the Camargue, and composed of mudbanks, lagoons, and marshes ; it receives rt., the Saone from the plateau of Langres, with its affluent, the Doubs; 1., the Isere with the Are and the Drac, and the Durance. Of the less important rivers we may notice \u2014 the Adour, between the Garonne and the Pyrenees ; the Charente, between the Garonne and the Loire ; the Somme, between the Seine and the N.E. frontier ; the Var,"], [213, "197 Chap. VIII. MINERALS\u2014 CLIMATE\u2014 VEGETATION. near the Italian frontier ; and, W. of the Rhone, the Herault and the Orb, from the Ce'vennes, the Aude, the Tet, and the Tech, from the Pyrenees. \u00a7 6. Minerals. \u2014 France possesses extensive coalfields in the fol lowing quarters : \u2014 in the N, about the Schelde, near Valenciennes ; in the centre, along the upper Loire, particularly near St. Etienne, and between that river and the Saone ; and in the S., in the depart ments of Aveyron and Gard, particularly about Alais. These fields yielded in 1863 between ten and eleven millions of tons, and are increasing their yield, which is still quite insufficient for the require ments of the country. Iron is abundant, but the manufacture has hitherto been impeded by the want of coal in the immediate neigh bourhood of the ore. Lead and copper are widely diffused, the former being most abundant in Brittany, in the Ce'vennes, and about the Isere; and the latter about Lyons. Silver is found in a pure state about the Isere. Granite is found in the Alps, Vosges, Ardennes, Ce'vennes, and in Brittany ; marble, in the Pyrenees ; lava, in Au vergne ; lithographic stone, in various parts ; kaolin, or china-clay, in Limousin ; rock-salt, about Vic in dep. Meurthe ; and gypsum, about Paris. Mineral springs are numerous in the Pyrenees (Bareges, Eaux-Chaudes, &c), and are also found in the Auvergne district (Vichy, &c), and in the Vosges. \u00a7 7. Climate and Vegetation. \u2014 France lies between the iso therms of 50\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, with a difference of about 27\u00b0 between the summer and winter temperatures. The annual rainfall at Paris is about 25 inches, and in the valley of the Rhone about 35 inches. Provence suffers from heat, and occasionally from the desolating effects of a violent Alpine blast, known as the mistral. The varying degrees of temperature are exhibited in the limits of certain plants ; the vine, as a wine-producing plant, being limited N. by a line crossing diagonally between Morbihan Bay in the W., to the point where the Meuse crosses the N.E. border ; the maize, by a line between the Gironde and the confluence of the Lauter with the Ehine ; the olive, by a line between the sources of the Aridge and the Durance ; and the orange, by a line running parallel to the Mediterranean coast, E. of the Rhone. There may thus be said to be five zones of temperature and vegetation, four of which are cha racterised by the presence of the plants above-mentioned, while the fifth or northern one has a vegetation similar to that of the S. of England. The soil is generally fertile ; the most favoured districts are the mid- valley of the Loire (about Tours) ; the wine-producing districts of Champagne, Burgundy, and Bordeaux ; and the sheltered plains and valleys of Provence. The drained lands in French Flanders are very productive under the careful culture bestowed upon them, and large amounts of grain are raised in the northern provinces (Flanders, Artois, and Picardy). The best pastures are"], [214, "FRANCE. Book I 198 in Normandy, Poitou, Berri, and on the slopes of Jura, the Ardennes, and the Auvergne mountains. The forests occupy about twenty millions of acres, or about 16 per cent, of the whole area. In 1750 they covered more than twice this area. The destruction of the forests has had prejudicial effects in the high valleys of Provence and Dauphiny, which have lost their cultivable surface-soil in con sequence of its exposure to the violence of the rains and mountain torrents. The dreary plains, called the Landes, have been largely planted with the maritime pine, which, besides yielding rosin and wood, serves to bind the sand: between the forests are dry and sandy heaths yielding a scanty pasturage; the inhabitants are adepts in the use of stilts. 49. The Landes. \u00a7 8. Population \u2014 Government\u2014 Occupations, &c\u2014 The popu lation of France is, next to Italy, the most homogeneous of any European country. Nine-tenths of the nation are French, properly so called \u2014 the descendants of a mingled stock of Celts (Gauls), Romans, and Teutons (Franks, Burgundians, and Visigoths). These adopted a Romance (Latin) tongue, which branched off into two great divisions, designated after their respective equivalents for tne word \" yes,\" the langue d'oe, and the langue d'o\u00ab7, or oui. The former prevails S. of the 46th parallel, and has given name to the old pro vince of Languedoc ; the Provencal, or language of the Troubadours, is a branch of it ; it is still spoken by 14 millions of the people. The langue a\"oui is the French of literature and society, and has ob-"], [215, "ClIAP. VIII. POPULATION, GOVERNMENT, ETCl 199 tained its present supremacy through the position of the capital. The remaining one-tenth of the population consists of the following elements : \u2014 Flemings, of the Teutonic family, in French Flanders ; Germans, in Alsace, Lorraine, and Franche-Compte' ; Celts, in Brit tany, descendants of British who emigrated thither in the 5th cen tury ; Basques, in the Western Pyrenees ; and Cagots, an outcast race of unknown origin, who maintain a lingering existence in the Pyrenees. The last-mentioned peoples retain for the most part their own tongues, though French has supplanted German in much of Lorraine, and the Celtic is now confined to the extreme west of Brittany. The population of France increases very slowly; it has taken above 150 years to double itself. It is most dense in the manufacturing districts of the north and north-east (the departments of Seine, Nord, Pas-de-Calais, Bas-Rhin, and Haut-Rhin), and about Lyons. The French are an ingenious, lively, polished people ; pa triotic and ambitious of military glory ; but fickle and wanting in depth of character. Marked differences of dress, manner, and temper are found in the various provinces : under this head we may notice the swaggering, bragging air of the Gascon ; the rough, irascible temper of the Provencal ; the stolidity of the Fleming ; and the primitive simplicity of the Breton. About 26,000 English were found sojourning in France in 1861. Government. \u2014 The constitution of France is composed of the following elements : \u2014 (1) An Emperor, in whom the whole executive power is vested, and who is himself irresponsible. (2) Ministers, appointed by the emperor, responsible to the nation, and acting independently of each other in their respective departments. (3) A Privy Council of seven members, over whom the emperor presides. (4) A Legislative body, elected for a term of Bix years by the nation at the rate of one deputy for 35,000 electors, and empowered to discuss and either pass or reject any measure brought before it by the Council of State. (5) A Senate, limited to 150 members, appointed for life by the emperor, and consisting of various high officials, charged with the duty of watching all matters relating to public liberty and the constitution. (6) A Council of State, consisting of from 40 to 50 members, holding office at the emperor's pleasure, whose business it is to initiate the measures to be laid before the legislative body, and generally to conduct the execu tive under the direction of the emperor. Centralization is the leading feature in the present system of government. Religion and Education. \u2014 The utmost religious toleration prevails in France. The Roman Catholic Church is largely predominant ; the Protestants are variously estimated at from 1\u00a3 to 2| millions, and of these the majority are Calvinists, the Lutherans being chiefly confined to Alsace. The clergy are paid by the State. Education is conducted by the State : most of the parishes (communes) have elementary schools, and higher education is supplied in sixteen public schools and at the four universities of Paris, Poitiers, Toulouse, and Montpellier. Agriculture. \u2014 The progress of scientific farming is impeded by the minute subdivision of the soil consequent upon the laws of inheritance. The number of agriculturists (men and women) exceeds 14 millions. The amount of cultivable land is estimated at 85 millions of acres."], [216, "200 FRANCE. Book I. about two-fifths of which are arable, and produce large quantities of wheat, rye, barley, maize, beet-root (for sugar), and tobacco. Vineyards. \u2014 The vineyards of France occupy 5 millions of acres, or about l-17th part ofthe cultivable area. The most important districts are the following four : \u2014 Bordeaux, whence comes our \" claret,\" the finest wines being grown on the tongue of land called Me'doc between the sea and the Gironde ; Champagne, about the Marne at Epernay, Al, Avernay, &c. ; Burgundy, on the slopes of Cote d'Or at Vougeot, Nuits Beaune, &e. ; and the Rhone in Dauphiny (Cote-Rotie, Hermitage, and St. Peray). Silk-worms. \u2014 The culture of the silk-worm is an important occupation in the S. of France. The mulberry -tree was first introduced in 1 494, and has now extended over the whole southern district, more particu larly in the valley of the Rhone. The establishments for rearing the worm are called magnaneries. The amount produced is about 26 mil lions of pounds. Manufactures. \u2014 The manufactures of France have made great progress of late years. The characteristic productions of the country are articles of luxury, such as silk, jewellery, furniture, watches, confectionery, perfumery, &c. ; but, in addition to these, cotton and woollen goods are largely produced for home consumption, and there is an increasing production of iron : the manufactures of beet-root sugar, wine, and brandy are also important. The manufactures are fairly dispersed over the country. Paris is the head-quarters of those branches which we have noticed as the specialities of the country. The silk business is mainly located in the district where the raw material is produced, viz., in the valley of the Rhone ; and the coalfields attract to themselves various manufactures. The Northern Division is perhaps the most active manufacturing dis trict in France, particularly the department of Nord. The articles produced are cotton, linen, beet-root sugar, and sundries, and the chief towns for these articles are Lille, Valenciennes (lace), Cambray (whence comes the name \"cambric\"), Roubaix, Tourcoing, Douay, and Arras. Amiens, in the same division, is the seat of various textile manu factures, among which cotton-velvet and kerseymere are noticeable. The North-Eastern Division contains one of the seats of the hon manufacture in the department of Haut-Rhin. Muhlhausen produces a large amount of machinery, and is also a great place for cotton and printed stuffs, and so is Colmar in the same district. Sedan, on the Bel gian frontier, produces cloths, cashmeres, &c. The South-Eastern Division contains another iron district about the Upper Loire, where St. Etienne possesses extensive foundry works (artillery, machinery, &c). The same place is also the head-quarters of the ribbon manufacture. This division contains the important towns of Lyons, the head-quarters of the silk manufacture ; Besanjon, on the Doubs, where a large and still increasing business in watches is carried on ; and Roanne, on the Loire, a commercial entrepot, and the seat of various manufactures. The Southern Division contains an active manufacturing centre in the departments of Ardeche and Gard, where, in addition to iron at and about Alais, may be noticed the paper manufacture, of which Annonay is the head-quarters. The distinctive business of this region is, however, silk, which is worked at Valence, Nimes, Alais, and other places, and has led to the introduction of other textile products, as of cotton at Valence and NImes, woollen and linen at Vienne. Various manufactures are carried on at Montpellier, Carcassone, and Toulouse. Cette is devoted to the manipulation of wines."], [217, "Chap. VIII. OCCUPATIONS\u2014 POLITICAL DIVISIONS. 201 The South-Western Division is, to a very slight degree, manufac turing. We may, however, notice among the towns Montauban, (woollen stuffs, sackcloth, &c), Angouleme (paper), and Niort (carpets and gloves). The North-Western Division contains important manufacturing town3 in its eastern part, among which Rouen is pre-eminent as the chief seat of the cotton manufacture. We may further notice Elbceuf and Alen \u00a3on (cloth), Caen (lace), and Lisieux (coarse woollens and flannels). Brittany produces sail-cloth and other coarse textures. The Central Division contains an important iron manufacture about the Marne, where we may notice St. Dizier as devoted to this business, and Langres to cutlery. Sundry manufactures are scattered over the rest of this division, in which we may notice the following places : \u2014 St. Quentin (linen and muslin), Reims (merinoes, kerseymeres, &c), Sevres, near Paris (porcelain), Nevers (pottery and cannon), Chateau roux, in Touraine (cloth and iron), Limoges (porcelain), and Tulle (fire-arms). Commerce. \u2014 The value of the imports and exports of merchandise in 1864 amounted to nearly 5\u00a3 millions sterling, of which about 2_J repre sent the imports and about 3 the exports. The commercial marine amounts to about 15,000 vessels, carrying about a million tons, or about l-5th ofthe tonnage belonging to Great Britain. The chief imports are raw silk, wool, cotton, sugar, hides, wood, and coal ; arid the chief exports, silk and woollen stuffs, wines, furniture, millinery, corn, and leather. The chief trade, both import and export, is done with Great Britain. Communications. \u2014 The high-roads in France are substantially made, the central portion being generally paved. The rivers are connected by a network of canals, most of which have been already noticed in connec tion with the hydrography of the country. The railway system, like everything else in France, is carried out by State subsidies, and will ultimately become the property of the State. The most important lines radiate from Paris : the Northern, to Brussels, Boulogne, &c. ; the Eastern to Nancy, Strasbourg, Metz, &c; the Lyons and Mediterra nean, to Marseilles ; the Orleans Line, to the valley of the Loire, and S.W. to Bordeaux; and the Western, to Cherbourg, and, when com pleted, to Brest. Of other lines, the Southern, from Bordeaux to Per pignan, Cette, and Montpellier, is the most important. \u00a7 9. Political Divisions. \u2014 Previously to the Revolution of 1789, France (exclusive of Avignon and the Venaissin) was divided into 34 provinces of very unequal size, representing the old duchies and counties of the feudal period. Some of the smaller provinces were combined for the purposes of government, so that the number of governments was 31. For these the National Assembly substituted a more uniform division into departments, of which there were ori ginally 86, including Avignon and Venaissin, and the island of Corsica. This number has since been increased to 92, by the addition of two departments for Savoy, one for Nice, and three for Algeria. Each department is governed by a prefect, and is divided into circuits (arrondissements) under sub-prefects, cantons under magistrates, and parishes (communes), 37,510 in number, under mayors or bailiffs. For historical and general purposes the old division into provinces k 3"], [218, "202 FRANCE. Book I. holds its ground, and we therefore give it, with the departments in a parallel column, in the subjoined tables. In grouping the provinces and departments, we shall adopt a sevenfold division, based partly on geographical position and partly on characteristics of an historical character. These divisions will be as follows : \u2014 (1) The Northern, wherein a Flemish element is found. (2) The North-Eastern, of which Lorraine may be regarded as the nucleus, wherein a German element prevails. (3) The South-Eastern, or Burgundian, cor responding to the old Duchy of Burgundy. (4) The Southern, or Provencal, the region of the langue dCoc. (5) The South-Western, or ancient Aquitanian. (6) The North-Western, which is connected with the British Isles by blood as well as old political ties. (7) The Central, or old French, which formed the original nucleus of the empire. I.

Origin of the Names of the Provinces and Departments. \u2014 The names of the old provinces frequently embody historical facts. Taking them more or less in chronological order, we have in Provence a memorial of the original province of the Romans. Many of the ancient names of the tribes and towns reappear in a modified form \u2014 thus Artois represents the Atrebates, Rousillon the town of Ruscino, Gascony the Vascones, and Guienne Aquitania. Burgundy and Brittany are names of somewhat later date, and record respectively the immigration of the Burgundiones and of the Britons in the 5th century. Languedoc originated in the division of the language into the langue d'oc and the langue A' oui. Lor raine is so named after Lothaire II., who became its sovereign in 899. Franche-Compte means the \"free country/' or that part of old Bur gundy which acquired special privileges. Normandy is the country of the Northmen, who settled there in the beginning of the 10th cent. ; while Dauphiny was adopted in the llth cent, from the cognizance (a dolphin) of its counts.

The two banks of the Seine and the intermediate islands are connected by 23 bridges. The northern portion of the city con tains the public offices and the finest buildings and streets. Noteworthy Objects. \u2014 On the rt. bank of the Seine : \u2014 The Palace of the Tuileries, erected by Catharine de Medici in 1 564, the present resi dence of the sovereigns of France. The Place de la Concorde and the Champs Elysees, in front of the Palace, the noble vista which they form being terminated by the triumphal arch of l'Etoile, 162 ft. high. The Palace of the Louvre, with its magnificent galleries of paintings, sculp ture, antiquities, &c, erected partly by Francis I., 1530-1548, and com pleted by Louis XIV. The Hotel de Ville, or Town Hall. The Bourse, or Exchange. The Place Vendome, with its column 132 ft. high, com memorative of the victories of Napoleon I. The Church of the Madeleine, commenced in 1804 and completed in 1836. The Gates of St. Denis and St. Martin ; and the Cemetery of Pere-la-Chaise. On the He de la Cite-. \u2014 The Cathedral of Notre-Dame, 442 ft. long, erected between 1010-1260.

The Pantheon, with its conspicuous dome, used as a national mausoleum. The Hotel des Invalides, 1675, a military hospital. Historical Associations. \u2014 Paris, the capital of Hugh Capet; held by the English from 1421 to 1436; the massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572 ; the \" day of the barricades \" in 1588, when the Leaguers expelled Henri III.; besieged in 1590 by Henri IV.; peace between England, France, and Spain concluded here in 1763; the outbreak of the Revolu tion in 1789; Louis XVI. executed in 1793; besieged and taken by the allies in 1814, and again occupied in 1815; the Bourbons expelled in 1830, and the Orleans family in 1848. \u00a7 11. Provincial Towns. \u2014 Of the provincial towns, Lyons stands first in point of population, which exceeds 300,000 ; it is the chief manufacturing town, an important military post, and the capital of the Rhone valley. Marseilles comes next, with over 260,000 ; it has been already noticed as the first commercial port. From this we drop at once to Bordeaux, with a population of about 160,000, the great emporium of the \" claret \" district, and the port of the south west. There remain only 4 towns with a population over 100,000 \u2014 viz., Lille, the great fortress of the north, and an active manufac turing town ; Nantes, the port of the Loire ; Toulouse, the capital of the south, and the centre of a very large district ; and Bouen, on the"], [224, "FRANCE. Book I. 208 Seine, with extensive cotton manufactures. Taking the towns be tween 100,000 and 50,000, we have to notice the great naval ports of Toulon in the S., and Brest in the N.W.; the commercial port of Havre, which serves Paris ; the manufacturing towns of St. Etienne, on the upper Loire (ribbons, guns, and hardware); Amiens, on the Somme (various textures, cotton, linen, and woollen); Reims, on the Vele (merinoes, kerseymeres, &c.); Nimes and Montpellier, in the neighbourhood of the lower Rhone (silk and cotton); and Limoges, on the Vienne, an entrepot of commerce with the S.W., an educa tional town, and the seat of sundry manufactures, especially enamelled porcelain; the fortresses of Strasbourg, on the Ehine, and Metz, on the Meuse, the former also the seat of various industrial pursuits; and lastly, Orleans, centrally situated, an educational and industrial town. The majority of the French towns can claim a high anti quity ; the history of Marseilles goes back to the 6th century B.C.; many others inherit the classical names of the tribes of the Eoman period, as Eeims (Remi), Paris (Pan's!*), Orleans (Aureliani) ; while others, particularly in the Eoman provincia, retain their local ap pellation, as Nimes (Nemausus), Aix (Aqu\u0153), Avignon (Avenio). The towns vary much in aspect in the different districts; most of them have been at one time or other surrounded by walls, and are consequently cramped up and tortuous. Where the walls have been destroyed, their site is occupied with walks and avenues of trees (boulevards). Public fountains are a common feature in the streets, and monumental erections, such as triumphal arches and pillars, are more numerous than in English towns. Noteworthy Objects. \u2014 Fine churches in the northern half of the coun try, of which we may specify\u2014 the Cathedrals of Beauvais, remarkable for the height of its choir; Keims, highly decorated, its W. front adorned with 600 statues ; Amiens, magnificent porch ; Metz, light and elegant, with a great expanse of glass ; Strasbourg, with a steeple 468 ft. high, of wonderfully light construction ; Dijon, in the finest Gothic ; Bourges, a colossal edifice, with two massive towers and a fine W. facade ; Bouen, a massive and handsome edifice, but surpassed in elegance hy the Church of St. Ouen in the same town, with its graceful central tower, rose windows, and painted glass ; Evreux, with a light, open-work Bpire ; and Coutances, in Normandy, very complete, lofty in its interior, and with a fine central tower.

It lies just N. of Sardinia, from which it is separated by the Strait of Bonifacio. A central chain of mountains traverses it from N. to S., culminating in the central height of Monte Botondo (9060 ft.). The chief rivers are the Golo on tbe E. and the Liamone on the W. coast. The interior is rugged and wild : the mountain sides are clothed with fine forests.

La Suisse ; Germ. Schweiz), is a state of Central Europe, lying between 45\u00b0 48' and 47\u00b0 49' N. lat., 5\u00b0 55' and 10\u00b0 ZO E. long., and having as its conter minous countries France on the W. and S.W., Germany on the N. and E., and Italy on the S. Its general limits are fixed by the following natural features : \u2014 N. E., the Lake of Constance ; K, the"], [229, "Chap. IX. BOUNDARIES, AREA, ETC. 213 Ehine between the Lake of Constance and Basle ; W., the river Doubs and the range of Jura ; S.W., the Lake of Geneva ; S., the crest of the Central Alps between Col Ferret in the W. and the Gries Pass in the E., and the crest of the Rh\u00e6tian Alps, from the Bernardin pass eastward ; E., the Rh\u00e6ticon range and the Rhine. Between the Gries and Bernardin passes Switzerland crosses the Alps into Italy and includes the head of Lago Maggiore and the greater part of the Lago di Lugano. In the N. the cantons of Schaffhausen and Basle cross the Rhine, while the town of Constance on the S. side of the lake belongs to Baden. Its area amounts to 15,727 sq. m., and its population to 2,510,494. Political Position. \u2014 The position of Switzerland, interposed as it is between Germany and France, marks it out as neutral ground between those two great States, affording a wholesome check to border disputes and to military inroads on each other's territories. The diversities of race, language, and religion which prevail within the country itself, and the semi-independence of tbe cantons, aid in the maintenance of its neutrality. As Switzerland also holds the great passes of the Alps, she presents an obstacle to the transit of forces either to or from Italy, and protects the peninsula from its northern neighbours. Historical Geography. \u2014 The earliest act of confederation between Swiss cantons took place in 1315, and was restricted to the three forest cantons ( Waldstadle) of Schwytz, Uri, and Unterwalden, which had re volted against the Austrians in 1308. Around this nucleus other cantons gradually gathered \u2014 Lucerne in 1332, Zurich in 1351, Zug and Glarus in 1352, and Berne in 1353, making up the 8 \"old\" cantons which claimed precedence over the rest. To these were subsequently added Solothurn and Freyburg in 1481, Basle and Schaffhausen in 1501, and Appenzell in 1513, thus making up the full number of 13, which constituted the confederacy down to the time of the French revolution. In 1648 the independence of this confederacy was recognised in the Treaty of Westphalia. In 1803 the number of cantons was increased to 19 by the addition of Aargau, St. Gall, Grisons, Ticino, Thurgau, and Vaud. In 1815 a further addition was made of the cantons of Valais, Geneva, and Neufchatel, thus completing the present number of 22 cantons. Neufchatel was an appanage of the Prussian Crown from 1707 to 1848, when it threw off this supremacy, and gained internal independence. \u00a7 2. Configuration \u2014 Mountains, Peaks and Passes\u2014Gla ciers, &c. \u2014 Scenery \u2014 The greater part of Switzerland is mountain ous. The High Alps skirt the southern frontier and send their rami fications over the eastern and central regions. Jura fringes the W. frontier in a series of parallel chains, which terminate abruptly on the side of Switzerland. Between the Alps and Jura an elongated plain crosses the country diagonally from the Lake of Geneva in the S.W. to the Lake of Constance in the N.E., with a length of about 140 m. and a breadth varying from 20 to 30 m. This plain is generally undulating, hut is low and flat to the N.E. of the Lake of Neufchatel. The boundary between the Alpine region and the plain coincides generally with the Lakes Thun, Lucerne, Zug, and Zurich,"], [230, "Book I. 214 SWITZERLAND. 62. IXDEX. a. Finster-Aarhom group. Passes.\u2014 1. St. Bernard. 2. Simplon. 3. St. Gotbard. 4. Bernardin. 5. Splugen. 6. Septimer. 7. Jnlier. the two last being, however, included in the plain, and the two first in the mountains. The Alps are the most important feature in the physical geography of the country. Referring to the divisions of the system noticed in cap. 1, \u00a7 6, the Alps of Switzerland belong to the Pennine, Lepontian, and Rh\u00e6tian sections. This arrangement, applying as it does to the main chain, is of slight assistance in studying the general structure of the Swiss mountain-system. We therefore substitute for it another founded on the physical aspect of that system. An inspection of the sketch-map appended to this section will show the symmetrical arrangement of the valleys of the Rhone in the W. and the Inn in the E., running in the direction of the axis of the Alps and enclosed by chains of mountains which in each case converge at the head of the basins and fall into a single line of mountain-wall extending between the two. This single or central portion commences W. in the mountain-knot surrounding the pass of St. Gothard, whence the Rhone, the Vorder-Rhein, the Reuss, and the Ticino pour down in different directions ; and terminates E. in Mt. Maloja, whence a similar divergence of streams takes place in respect to the Inn, the Oberhalbstein-Rhein, and the Maira. Westward of the St. Gothard group the valley of the Rhone is inclosed between the divergent ranges of the Bernese Alps on the N., and the Valais Alps or the main crest of the Central Alps on the S. Eastward of the Maloja the valley of the Inn is similarly inclosed between the massive heights of Bernina on the S., and the less important ranges of the Albiila Alps and their continuations, on the N. The intermediate"], [231, "Chap. IX. CONFIGURATION. 215 or central portion is composed of several links, the most important of which is the Adula group about the sources of the Hinter-Rhein. From the western extremity of this section (the St. Gothard group), two important offsets ramify into central Switzeiland, one of which proceeds in a due N. direction to the Lake of Lucerne and is hence termed the Vierwaldstadter Alps, while the other (the Todi range) proceeds N.E. between the Reuss and the Rhine, bifurcates at the head of the Linth Valley, covers the cantons of Glarus and Schwytz, and rises again on the other side of the Wallenstadt Lake in the canton of Appenzell. Returning to the St. Gothard a southern range, the Tioino Alps, may be noticed proceeding S.E. along the rt. bank of the Ticino. It remains only to notice the Eh\u0153ticon range in the E., which crosses between the valleys of the Rhine and the Inn, joining the ranges that bound the basin of the Inn in the mountain knot of Selvretta. Mountains, Peaks, and Passes. \u2014 (1) The Valais Alps contain some of the grandest scenery of the Alpine region. Several of the finest peaks lie on the Italian side of the frontier line, as Monte Rosa (15,160 ft.) and the Matterhorn or Mont Cervin (14,836 ft.), the latter of which, rising like a gigantic obelisk of rock, is the most striking mountain in the whole range. These mountains are ordinarily approached from the Swiss side (Zermatt), and are consequently more associated with Switzerland than with Italy. The loftiest mountain in Switzerland itself is the Saas Grat (14,924 ft.), one of the Mischabel peaks N.E. of Monte Rosa. The most frequented passes are the Simplon, between Brieg and Domo d'Ossola, the first of the great carriage-roads opened across the Alps, constructed by Napoleon I. (1806); and the Great St. Bernard, between Martigny and Aosta, a bridle-road, historically famous for the passage of Napoleon's army in 1800. The Furka pass gives access to the Rhone basin from St. Gothard. (2) The Bernese Alps contain a magnificent group of mountains between the Rhone valley and the lakes of Thun and Brienz, consisting of the Finster-Aarhom (14,130 ft.), a needle-shaped peak ; the Jung-frau, or \"Maiden\" (13,720 ft.), so called either from its graceful form and the purity of its snow, or from having until recently defied ascent ; the Wetterhorn, or \"Peak of Tempests\" (12,200 ft.), whose top is ren dered almost inaccessible by an overhanging cornice of ice ; the Metten berg with its two Schreckhorner, \" Peaks of Terror \" (the highest 13,410 ft.); the round-topped, smooth-headed Monch, or \"Monk\" (13,510 ft.); and the Great Eigher, or \" Giant\" (13,060 ft.). (3) The chain between the valleys ofthe Rhone and the Inn contains two remarkable mountain groups, one of which surrounds the pass of St. Gothard, and is composed of a circle of lofty mountains, of which the Gallenstock (10,370 ft.) in the N.W. is the loftiest. The other is the Adula group, situated at the head of the Hinter-Rhein, and consisting of the Eheinwaldhorn (11,148 ft.), the Moschelhorn, and other moun tains. The chief passes are the St. Gothard, between the valleys of the Reuss and the Ticino, over which an excellent carriage-road was con structed in 1832 ; the Lukmanier pass, between the Mittel-Rhein and the Ticino, a much frequented bridle-path ; the Bernardin pass, between the Hinter-Rhein and the Val Misocco, leading to the Lago Maggiore,"], [232, "SWITZERLAND. Book I. 216 with a carriage-road constructed in 1822; the Splugen, also from the Hinter-Rhein, but leading down to Lake Como, with a carriage-road constructed in 1823 by the Austrians, and remarkable for the length of its galleries; and the Septimer, just W. of Mt. Maloja, between the Oberhalbstein Rhine and the Maii-a, a bridle-road. (4) The Bernina mountains are a long and lofty chain, varying in height from 8000 to 13,000 ft., culminating in Piz Mortiratsch (13,290 ft.), and crossed by the Bernina pass between Samaden and Puschiavo, a difficult bridle-road, attaining an elevation of 7695 ft. The Bernina range has been but little explored. (5) The northern range of the Engadine contains the Albula Alps, about the head of the river of that name ; the Scaletta Alps, more to the E. ; and the Selvretta Alps, also known as the Fermunt, with the culminating height of Piz Linard (11,420 ft.). The more frequented passes are the Julier, from the Oberhalbstein-Rhine to the head of the Inn, with a carriage-road constructed in 1839; the Albula pass, a foot way which follows the course of the Albula ; and the Scaletta pass, also a footway. (6) The Vierwaldst'adter Alps culminate in Titlis (10,690 ft.), and are crossed by two passes, the Siirenen N. and the Susten S. of the Titlis, the former communicating between the valleys of the Reuss and the Aa, the latter between the Reuss and the Gadmen, a branch of the Aar. Mount Pilatus, near Lucerne, belongs to this section of the Alps. (7) The Todi range is so called after the peak of that name (11,880 ft.), an inaccessible height at the head of the Linth valley. The eastern branch of the range terminates on the 1. bank of the Rhine in the heights of Calanda : the western branch contains the Clariden Alps and other lofty heights, among which we may include the well-known height of Mt. Righi, near Lucerne. The passes across these mountains are difficult footways, the best known being those of Panixer, Segues, and Kunkel in the eastern branoh, Klausen and Kinzig-culm in the western : the last-mentioned, between Altorf and Muotta, was crossed by Suwarrow's army in 1799 with great loss. N. of Lake Wallenstadt rises a range with 7 peaks, hence called the Kurfursten, or \" Electors;\" on the other (N.) side of the valley of the Thur is a range, of which Ssintis ( 8,280 ft.) is the culminating point. Glaciers, Avalanches, Floods, and Landslips. \u2014 The summits and sides of the High Alps are covered with vast accumulations of snow and ice. The aggregate area of these accumulations is estimated roughly at 1000 sq. m., the most remarkable and extensive fields in Switzerland being those which surround the Fiuster-Aarhorn in the Bernese Alps (12o sq. m.), and Monte Rosa in the Valais Alps. The glaciers of Grindel wald, Eosenlaui, the Aare, and the Ehone, are well known from their accessibility. The wide expanses of snow-field are termed \" the sea of ice \" (Mer de Glace). The lower edges of the glaciers are covered with stones and dirt, brought down from the rocks ; these dirt beds, termed moraines, have a very rugged and unsightly appearance. The water that issues from a glacier is thick, as though mixed with soap-suds. The snow on tbe slopes occasionally detaches itself and rushes down into the valleys, overwhelming not only single travellers, but whole villages and forests. On the great roads across the Alps, protection against such avalanches is furnished by refuges placed at the dangerous spots, and occasionally by covered ways. A sudden thaw or the giving way of an ice-dam sometimes produces floods, which desolate whole"], [233, "Chai\\ IX. 217 RIVERS AND LAKES. valleys. The valley of the Drance above Martigny has been twice devastated in this way (in 1545 and 1818), and the valley of the Rhone in 1852. Landslips occur through the accumulation of water under the surface of the soil on a hillside : the fall of the Rossberg near Lucerne in 1806 destroyed 3 villages and 450 persons. Alpine Scenery. \u2014 Among the special objects of interest in the Swiss Alps the following may be specified : ( 1 ) Gorges.\u2014 Via Mala, in the valley of the Hinter-Rhein above Tusis; Schollenen, in the valley of the Reuss, on the St. Gothard route ; Gondo, at the head of the Simplon pass ; Pfeffers, in St. Gall, in the valley of the Tamina ; and leuk, in Valais, at the foot of the Gemini pass. (2) Waterfalls. \u2014 The Staub bach, or \" Dust-fall,\" which falls in a shower of spray a sheer height of about 850 ft., near Lauterbrunnen ; the Reichenbach, near Meyringen \u2022 the Giessbach, on the S. side of the lake of Brienz; the Aare, at Handek, altogether the finest in Switzerland ; and the Sallenche, near Martigny. (3) Passes. \u2014 In addition to the great passes already noticed, viz., Simplon, St. Gothard, Splugen, Bernardino, and Furka, we may specify the Grimsel, at the head of the Aare valley; the Wengern Alp, between Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen ; the Gemini, in the Bernese Alps, be tween Kandersteg and Leuk ; tbe Tete-Noire and Col de Balme, between Martigny and Chamouni ; the Theodule, between Zermatt and Chatillon (11,185 ft. high); and Monte Moro (9640 ft.), between Saas and the valley of the Macugnaga. \u00a7 3. Rivers and Lakes. \u2014 Switzerland sends its waters towards four seas \u2014 hy the Rhine to the North Sea, by the Inn to the Black Sea, by the Rhone to the Gulf of Lions, and by the Ticino to the Adriatic. The bulk of the area belongs to the Rhine, or rather to its tributary the Aare, which occupies about 6780 sq. m., or more than \u00a7 of the whole, and which, from its position, as well as from the size of its basin, may be regarded as pre-eminently the river of Switzerland. The Aare rises in the heart of the Bernese Alps iu the glacier of the Finster-Aarhorn, and descends rapidly through the Hasli valley to the Lake of Brienz, and then across a narrow isthmus to the Lake of Tliun. From Thun it flows N.W. to its junction with the Saane, which comes from the most westerly portion of the Bernese range. It then turns N.E. ; receives 1. the Thiel, with the surplus waters of the Lakes of Neufchatel and Bienne, which are fed by the Orbe and other streams from Jura; rt. the Emmen and the wild Reuss, which rises on St. Gothard, rushes down through the gorge of the Devil's Bridge to the Vierwaldst'adter Lake, or Lake of Lucerne, and then crosses the plain, receiving, rt\u201e the Lorze from the Lake of Zug; and finally the Limmat (called the Linth in its upper course), which rises between the two great arms of the Todi range, is carried by an artificial channel into the Lake of Wallenstadt, and thence by the Linth canal into the Lake of Zurich, emerging from which it immediately receives the Sihl, and crosses the plain to the Aare : the Aare then turns N. and reaches the Rhine oppo site Waldshut. The Ehine itself is formed by the union of two streams of nearly equal importance \u2014 the Vorder- Rhein, which rises E. of the St. Gothard group, and the Hinter-Rhein, which rises on the Rheinwaldhorn and forces its way through the wonderful gorge of tbe Via Mala, just above MOD. geo. I."], [234, "218 SWITZERLAND. Book I. Tusis. The united stream curves round to the Lake of Constance, or Boden-see, receiving in its course, rt. the Landquart, aud 1. the Tamina : emerging from the lake it flows W. to Basle, descending below Schaff hausen 100 ft. by a series of falls, and receiving the Thur, the Toss, and the Glatt before its junction with the Aare. The Rhone rises W. of St. Gothard, flows S.W. to Martigny, and N.W. to the Lake of Geneva ( Lake Leman \\ emerging from which with a deep blue current it meets the turbid Arve from Mt. Blano, and shortly after quits the Swiss territory. The Inn rises on Mt. Maloja and flows N.E. through the Engadine. The Ticino belongs more to Italy than to Switzerland. The following table contains the most important facts in respect to the lakes above mentioned: \u2014 These lakes afford scenery of the most varied character. Lucerne is irregular in shape, and embosomed amid wild and lofty mountains, which frequently descend in sheer precipices to its waters. Geneva is open towards its W. extremity, and enclosed by lofty mountains at its upper end. Zurich is soft and pleasing, with fertile slopes dotted with numerous villages. Constance is tame. Thun commands fine views of the Bernese mountains : the neighbouring lake of Brienz is closely sur rounded by heights. Neufchatel has low shores on its E. side, and is comparatively uninteresting. In 1853-4 the first discovery of the lake dwellings on piles took place at Obermeilen on Lake Zurich, when the waters happened to be unusually low. \u00a7 4. Political Divisions. \u2014 Switzerland is divided into 22 cantons for the purposes of the Confederacy, but into 25 cantons, as far as internal independence is concerned. The three extra cantons in the latter case are gained by the division of Basle into Basle- Ville (town), and Basle-Campagne (country) ; of Appenzell into Ausser-Rhoden and Inner-Rhoden, and of Unterwalden into Obwalden and Nid walden \u2014 the subdivisions being in each case separate cantons for the management of their own affairs. The cantons vary in size, from Grisons with its 27 06 sq. m. to Zug with its 90 sq. m. The geo graphical position of the cantons is indicated in the table in \u00a7 7. The Names of the Cantons. \u2014 The cantons have in several instances dis tinct forms in the French and German languages. Neufchatel, for instance, is designated in German by the synonymous term Neuenburg (= Newcastle), Grisons by Graubiinden, Vaud by Waadt, Valais by Wallis, and Geneve by Gens. On the other hand, the French designate Name. Length in m. Area in height .\u201e \u2122 above sea B9* m' in ft. Geneva Constance . Neufchatel . . . .

POLITICAL DIVISIONS \u2014 POPULATION, ETC. 219 Aargau, Argovie, Thurgau Thurgovie, and Solothurn Soleure. Several of the names are worthy of notice : Graubiinden commemorates the existence of the 3 confederacies formed in the 14th aud 15th centuries to resist the feudal lords : one of these was designated the \" Grail \" or \" grey \" bund, after the hue of the coats worn in a particular part of the canton : the 3 confederacies coalesced for joint purposes in 1472, but retained their separate existence for internal administration until 1 848 . Valais, or Wallis, comes from the same root as our \" Wales,\" and betokens a non- German country. St. Gall commemorates the missionary labours of the saint of that name in the early part of the 7th cent., while Appenzell {.abbatis cella) implies the ecclesiastical subordination of this district to the abbot of St. Gall. The name of Schwytz has extended from the canton to the whole country, the identity being most perceptible in the German Schweiz. \u00a7 5. Population, Government, Religion, and Education. \u2014 The ethnology of Switzerland is remarkable for the variety of race and language comprised within so small a compass. The bulk of the present population is Teutonic, partly of the Burgundian and partly of the Allemannic branches. The existence of a prior Celtic popula tion is abundantly testified by local names, and the remains of it probably still linger in the high Alps. Four languages are spoken, French by the Burgundian Swiss W. of the Saane, in the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Neufchatel, Freyburg, and Valais up to Pfynn in the Rhone valley ; German by the occupants of the northern, central, and eastern cantons, who are partly of Burgundian and partly of Alle mannic origin ; Italian in the districts S. of the Alps ; and R\u00e6to- Romansch in the Engadine and other high valleys of the Grisons. Of these languages there are in all no less than 61 dialects. The R\u00e6to-Romansch is interesting from the admixture of peculiar words, which may possibly be connected with the Etruscan language. The liomansch itself is the Latin of the old Rh\u00e6tians : it is still spoken by 42,000 persons, and has a scanty literature : most, however, of those who use it are also acquainted with German or Italian. A distinct dialect of Romansch is spoken about Gruyeres in Freyburg. The Swiss are patriotic, hardy, industrious, frugal, and hospitable. The lower class are venal, and their love of money has passed into a proverb (Point d 'argent, point de Suisses). From the mountain valleys, and particularly the Engadine, the people emigrate to the large towns of Europe for employment, and return with their earnings in their old age. Among the national peculiarities may be noticed the gay costumes of the females still surviving in some of the moun tainous regions, the wild songs of the shepherds (ranz des vaches), and their musical instrument, the Alp-horn ; the bright colours, religious inscriptions, and deep eaves of the houses; the contests in rifle-shooting and wrestling; and the unhappy prevalence of the loathsome goitre, and of cretinism or idiotcy in many of the deep valleys. I, 2"], [236, "220 SWITZERLAND. Book I. Government. \u2014 Switzerland is a confederate State (Bimdesstaat), and is governed by a Federal Assembly, consisting of two bodies, one of which (the Nationalrath) represents the people as a whole, being elected at the rate of a deputy for each 20,000 inhabitants, while the other (the Stdnderath) represents the cantons, each of which chooses 2 de puties. The Federal Assembly devolves the executive on a council {Bundesrtdh) of 7 members, chosen out of its own body. A high tribunal ( Bundes-Gericht) is similarly appointed for the settlement of all questions of national law. Religion and Education. \u2014 The only exception to the general toleration of all forms of Christianity is iu respect to the Jesuits, who are excluded. The Protestants number about a million and a half, the Roman- Catholics about a million. The districts exclusively Protestant are Zurich, Schaffhausen, Vaud, Neufchatel, and Appenzell-ausser-Rhoden: the districts mainly, but not exclusively Protestant, are Berne, Thurgau, Grisons, and Basle : in Aargau and Geneva the parties are equally balanced, and in tbe remaining cantons Romanism is either partly or exclusively predominant. Elementary education is general in the exclusively Protestant cantons ; elsewhere it is backward. The higher education is provided for at the universities of Berne, Basle, and Zurich, and at the academies of Geneva and Lausanne. \u00a7 6. Climate and Resources. Agriculture, Manufactures, Commerce, and Communications. \u2014 The climate of Switzerland varies with the elevation, but is everywhere more severe than in our country. In the Engadine the year is said to consist of 9 months of winter and 3 of cold weather ; and the same description applies to many of the high Alpine valleys. The average temperature of the plain is about 4 degrees below that of England, with a considerably wider range of heat and cold. The soil of the plain and some of the low valleys is adapted to arable purposes, and yields good crops of cereals, including occasionally maize. The vine and fig ripen in the western districts, particularly in Vaud, Neufchatel, and the Rhone valley. The uplands and high valleys are only adapted to pasture. Minerals are restricted to iron, chiefly in the Jura district, tin and zinc in the Grisons, coal in Zurich, St. Gall, Aargau, and Basle, and salt, of which there are springs at Bex. Wood is abundant. On the S. side of the Alps the vegetation and products resemble those of Northern Italy. Agriculture. \u2014 Dairy produce is the chief resource of the Swiss : its cheese is famous, and some kinds, as Gruyeres (Freyburg) and Schab zieger (Glarus), are well known in England. The cattle of the Simmen thal, of Saanen or Gessonay, where the Gruyeres cheese is made, and of Schwytz, are excellent. The corn produced is insufficient for home consumption: flax and hemp are among the ordinary crops. Manufactures. \u2014 The distinctive manufactures of Switzerland are watch-making and jewellery, which are carried on largely in the Jura district and at Geneva. The textile products are cotton and silk, pro duced in Basle and Zurich, and embroidery in St. Gall and Appenzell. Printing and dyeing are carried on in Glarus, and straw-plaiting very generally."], [237, "221 Chap. IX. CLIMATIC \u2014 COMMERCE \u2014 TOWNS, ETC. Commerce. \u2014 The position of Switzerland secures to it a large amount of the transit traffic between Italy and the north. Its own exports con sist of dairy produce and manufactured goods, and the imports of grain, wine, tobacco, raw cotton and Bilk, and colonial produce. Communications. \u2014 The great roads across the Alps are models of skilful engineering: their position and the dates of their construction have been already noticed. The country is unfavourable to railroads ; but lines are formed from the Rhine at Waldshut S.W. to Neufchatel and Geneva, with branches to Lucerne and Thun, and S.E. to Zurich and Coire: from tbe latter, branches diverge to the Lake of Constance and along the valley of the Rhine above the lake. 53. Lausanne, \u00a7 7. Towns, Noteworthy Objects, Historical Associations. \u2014 Switzerland possesses only 4 towns with a population exceeding 20,000, viz., Geneva, a manufacturing and residential town at the outlet of the Rhone from the Lake of Geneva ; Berne, centrally situated, the seat of the National Assembly ; Basle, on the Rhine, the seat of various manufactures in silk and wool ; and Lausanne, on tho Lake of Geneva, a residential and educational town. Ziirioh has very nearly 20,000 inhabitants, and takes high rank as a literary town (the \" Athens \" of Switzerland), with a university and other educational establishments ; it is also the seat of a large cotton and silk manu facture. Chaux-de-Fonds in the Jura is the chief seat of the watch manufacture, and St. Gall of muslin, cotton, and dyeing establish ments. Lucerne, Neufch&tel, and Freyburg, are the only other towns with a population of 10,000. The baths of Pfeffers, in St. Gall, and leuk, in Valais, are noted as well for their remarkable position as for their medicinal virtues. The mineral springs at Baden and Schintznach in Aargau are also much frequented. The Swiss towns are not remarkable for architectural beauty, nor are they rich in his-"], [238, "222 SWITZERLAND.

BOUNDARIES \u2014 HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY, ETC. 225 Luxembourg; and S., Prance. In all these directions it lies per fectly open ; towards Prance in particular it is furnished with natural highways in the rivers which cross the frontier from S. to N. The form of the territory approximates to a triangle, of which the apex rests on the Meuse in the N.E., and the base coincides with the French frontier. The direct length of this base-line equals about 190 m., and the distance from the apex to the base-line about 115 m. Its area is 11,402 sq. m., and its population 4,894,071. Influence of Position.\u2014 The position of Belgium has at all periods materially affected its political status. Having no natural boundaries, and wedged in between the two great nationalities of France and Germany, it has hitherto failed to establish a distinctive nationality of its own. At present, it may be looked upon as neutral ground between France and Germany, though more intimately associated with the former than with the latter. Its conventional boundaries mark it out as a conventional state. Historical Geography. \u2014 The separate existence of Belgium dates no farther back than 183U, when it broke off its uncongenial partnership with the Netherlands. In the 1 5th century it belonged to the Duke of Burgundy, from whom it passed to the house of Austria by the mar riage in 1477 of Maria, daughter of Charles the Bold, with Maximilian, and it was attached in 1496 to the Spanish branch of that house. By the treaties of 1713 and 1715 these provinces were ceded to Austria, with which they remained until the outbreak of the Revolutionary war in 1795. France then held them until 1814. Military Geography. \u2014 The southern frontier of Belgium is open to France, as described in the last chapter. The country between the Schelde and the Sambre is singularly adapted to strategetical opera tions, being open and undulating, moderately wooded, and traversed by streams which favour rather than impede such operations. It has witnessed so much fighting as to merit its designation of the \" Cockpit of Europe.\" A system of fortresses \u2014 some of great strength, others in a state of inefficiency \u2014 surrounds this district as a counterpoise to the French fortresses. On the coast is the fortified port of Ostend ; be tween the coast and the Lys, Ypres ; on the line of the Lys, Menin, Courtrai, and Ghent, the last a place of great strength ; on the Schelde, Tournay and Oudenarde ; between the Schelde and the Sambre, Mons, another very strong place ; on the Sambre, Charleroi ; between the Sambre and Meuse, Philippeville and Mariembourg, both very im portant positions ; and on the Meuse, Dinant, Namur ( strongly posted at the confluence of the Sambre), Huy, and Lie'ge. At the back of all stands Antwerp, the strongest fortress in Belgium, and the one on which above others the national existence is supposed to depend. Belgian Names. \u2014 In the names of places, &c, English usage has adopted sometimes the French, and sometimes the German or Flemish form, without any consistent rule. Thus we designate one of the two chief rivers by its German title of Schelde instead of the French Esraut, and the other by its French title of Meuse instead of the German Maas. We follow the French in regard to Bruges, Tournay, Louvain, and Liege, in preference to the -German Brugge, Doornik, Lowen. and Liit- i. 3"], [242, "Book I. 226 BELGIUM. tick. We follow the Gwman, on the other hand, in regard to Antwerp, Brussels, and Ghent, in preference to the French Anvers, Bruxelles, and Gand. We talk of Mecldin lace, but more commonly call the place itself by its French name of Malines. The pronunciation of these names follows the general rules of the French and German languages. Huy (it may be observed) is pronounced like we. \u00a7 2. Configuration, Rivers, Climate, and Productions. \u2014 The bulk of Belgium is a plain, sometimes undulating, but generally flat. The S. E. portion, bounded by a line drawn from Mons to Maas tricht, and occupied by the forest of Ardennes, is a rugged broken country. The coast-line is regular, and affords no opening within the limits of Belgium itself: Antwerp, the only harbour of capacity, is situated on the Schelde, the lower course of which is commanded by Holland. Ostend is an artificial harbour, and Niewport is only adapted for fishing vessels. The coast is fringed with dunes or sand hills, attaining occasionally a height of 50ft. : these form a natural barrier against the encroachments of the sea, and are kept in their place by planting them with certain kinds of grass. The aspect of the western provinces is dull and monotonous, but their fertility renders them not unpleasing. In the N.E. (Limbourg) there is a broad belt of heath, sand, and bog, called the Campine, of extremely desolate appearance : this has been turned to some account by planting it with pines. The valleys of the S.E., particularly the Ourthe and the Meuse, are very picturesque. Belgium belongs almost wholly to the basins of the Schelde and the Meuse. These rivers rise in France, the Schelde near St. Quentin, and the Meuse on the Plateau of Langres : the latter receives an important tributary, the Sambre, which also rises iu France near Landrecies, and joins its 1. bauk at Namur. The sources of the Schelde and the Sambre are near each other, and thence the rivers deviate, the former N.W., the latter N.E., enclosing the area which has been referred to as so singularly adapted to strategetical operations. The interval between these two rivers is occupied by a network of streams connected with the Schelde : of these we may notice the Dender, which joins it at Dendermonde ( = Dender-rnouth), and the Eupel, which is composed of the Senne from the S., the Dyle from the S.E. with its affluent the Demer from the E., and an affluent of the Demer, viz., the Bette, and the Nethe from the N.E. The Demer, Dyle, and Kupel form in conjunction a nearly straight line from the Meuse at Maastricht to the Schelde. The lys is the only affluent of the Schelde on its 1. bank. Woods and forests occupy about one-fifth of Belgium : the western provinces are scantily, the central moderately, and the south-eastern densely wooded, a large portion ofthe Ardennes sorest falling within the latter. The climate is moderate : mean annual temperature at Brussels, 49\u00b0 fi', with a range of about 26\u00b0 between the mean summer"], [243, "Chap. X. CONFIGURATION\u2014 POPULATION, ETC. 227 and winter temperatures : the rainfall is about the same as in central England. The natural resources of Belgium fall under the two heads us agricultural and mineral : the soil, an admixture of clay and sand, is generali}7 fertile, and equally adapted to tillage and pasture. The Flemish or western provinces are the most productive, the northern least so. Coal is abundant, the chief fields lying in the provinces of Lie'ge, Namur, and Hainault : the yield exceeds ten millions of tons, about one-third of which is exported to France. Iron is found abundantly between the Sambre and Meuse, and supplies the material for the leading manufacture of the country. Copper and other minerals are also found in the south-eastern, which are more especially the mineral provinces. Mineral springs of repute occur at Spa and Chaudefontaine. \u00a7 3. Population, Government, Beligion, Occupations, &c. \u2014 The population of Belgium consists of two chief elements, the Flem ing and the Walloon, bearing to each other in point of numbers the relative proportions of two-thirds and one-third. The Flemings are of Teutonic origin, and speak a language more or less allied to German : they occupy the level provinces of the W. and N. The Walloons, whose name marks them out as non-Teutonic, speak a language resembling the French of the 13th century, with an admix ture of Celtic and German words : they occupy the south-eastern or hilly region. Germans are numerous in Luxembourg. The language of government and society is French, and the sympathies of the Belgians are decidedly French rather than German. The people are intelligent and industrious, and attached to their present institutions. The population is the densest of any European country, averaging, according to the statements in \u00a7 1, 430 inhabitants to the sq. m. The provinces of Luxembourg, Namur, and Lim bourg are thinly occupied as compared with the others. Government, Religion, Education, &a. \u2014 The constitution of Belgium is a limited monarchy, composed ofthe following elements \u2014 (1) A king, in whom the executive is vested, and who acts through responsible ministers. (2) A Chamber of Representatives, elected by the nation for four years, in the proportion of 1 for every 40,000 inhabitants. There are now 116 members. (3) A Senate, elected by the nation for eight years, in the proportion of 1 for every 80,000 inhabitants ; there are now 58 members. The chambers have, in conjunction with the king, the legislative power. Trial by jury prevails. The fullest religious toleration is established ; but, with the exception of 1 3,000 Protestants and 2000 Jews, the Belgians are Roman Catholics, and the country suffers from priestly domination. Ministers of all denominations re ceive pecuniary grants from the state. Primary education is mode rately advanced, but is not compulsory. The higher education is chiefly in the hands of the priesthood: of the four universities\u2014 Louvaiu, Ghent, Lie'ge, and Brussels \u2014 the last alone is independent of the priesthood."], [244, "228 BELGIUM. Book I. Agriculture, Manufactures, Commerce, and Communications.\u2014 In the western half of Belgium a most careful system of farming prevails, resolving itself in many districts into gardening or spade-husbandry. On the average, two-thirds of the soil in Hainault, East and West Flanders, and Brabant, are under crops. The special productions are flax of the best quality, hemp, artificial grasses (clover, &c), cattle, and butter. About a million of people (men and women) are engaged in agriculture. The manufactures of Belgium are \u2014 iron and machinery, including firearms ; lace and carpets ; silk ; linen, woollen, and cot ton ; beet-root sugar, &c. The manufactures are fairly distributed over the country. Iron is confined to the S. E. provinces. East Flanders is the chief seat of the cotton and linen, and West Flanders of the woollen manufacture. Tournay, in Hainault, is the chief place for the so-called Brussels carpets. Lace, for which the country is so famous, is made at most of the large towns of the western provinces. The transmarine commerce of Belgium is chiefly in the hands of foreigners ; the com mercial marine being limited to about 100 vessels, mostly of small tonnage. The exports to all quarters amount to a value of about twenty millions sterling, France standing foremost among her cus tomers, and England second ; the articles sent to the latter are chiefly silk, flax, yarn, and dairy produce : the Netherlands and Germany hold the next places. In regard to imports, France again stands fore most ; next comes the Netherlands ; and then England, which sends thither woollen stuffs, machinery, &c, but to a value far below that of the imports. The railway system of Belgium is very perfect ; the lines radiate from Malines as a centre N. to Antwerp and Rotterdam ; E., to Lie'ge and the Rhine ; W,, to Ghent and Ostend, and from Ghent to Courtrai and Lille ; S., to Brussels, Mons, and Valenciennes ; and-from Brussels S.E. to Namur and Luxembourg, The total mileage at work is 1,191 m,, a considerable portion of which already belongs to the state, and the remainder will fall in at the termination of the con cessions. Canals ramify about AVest Flanders, and extend to the Schelde at Ghent. The Schelde and Meuse are connected by means of a canal which leaves the Ne'the, and takes a circuitous route to Maastricht and Lie'ge. \u00a7 4. Political Divisions. \u2014 Belgium is divided into nine provinces, which are further subdivided as in France into 28 circuits (arrondisse ments), 365 cantons, and 2528 parishes (communes). The names of the provinces with the chief towns, are given in the subjoined table. Brabant is fully designated South Brabant to distinguish it from the province of that name in the kingdom of the Netherlands, and as Limbourg and Luxembourg partly belong to the latter province, the portions within Belgium are distinguished as Belgian. The geogra phical disposition of the provinces is as follows : \u2014West Flanders, on the sea-coast ; Antwerp, at the head of the estuary of the Schelde ; East Flanders, on the middle Schelde; Hainault, on the French frontier, about the upper Schelde and the Sambre ; Brabant, in tbe centre ; Limbourg, in the N.E., extending to the Meuse ; Lie'ge and Namur, on both sides of the Meuse ; and Luxembourg in the S.E."], [245, "ClIAP. X. POLITICAL DIVISIONS\u2014 TOWNS. 229 Note.\u2014' -The names printed in thick type specify the provincial capitals. \u00a7 5. The towns of Belgium possess great historical and architectural interest, and are now experiencing a revival of their ancient prosperity under the influence of manufacturing activity. Brussels, the capital, is centrally situated, and derives importance not only from being the seat of government, but from its various manufactures, particularly lace and carpets. Antwerp is at once the chief port and the chief fortress of the country : immense additions have been recently made to its fortifications. The towns most distinguished for manufactures are Ghent (liuen, carpets, and lace) ; liege (fire-arms and cutlery) ; Bruges (damask, carpets, and lace) ; Malines or Mechlin (damask, and lace); Tournay (carpets, woollen, and linen) ; Verviers (cloth); Mons (woollen) ; Namur (cutlery) ; Courtrai (linen) ; Charleroi (nails) ; Ypres, whence our word \" Diaper \" = d' Ypres (thread and woollen), and Louvain (beer). Many of these towns were of greater importance, both relatively and positively, in by-gone ages, than they are now. Bruges, for instance, was the great mart of Western Europe for oriental commerce in the 13th and 14th cents. : Antwerp had so large a commerce that 2500 vessels are said to have been seen at its docks at one time : while Ghent at the same period had 40,000 weavers, and could turn out 18,000 fighting men. It is to this period that Belgium owes the fine town-halls which adorn her towns.

II. The Netherlands. \u00a7 6. Boundaries, Size, Population, Historical Geography. \u2014 The Netherlands (Nederlanden ; Fr. Pays-Bas) occupy the N.W. angle of the Great Plain of Northern Europe. The name itself (meaning the ' low countries ') bespeaks the peculiarly depressed position of the country about the lower courses of the Rhine and the Meuse. The more familiar name of Holland, which has extended from one of the provinces to the whole country, describes the marshy character (from ollant ' fen ') of the soil in its natural state. The country is bounded N. and W. by the North Sea ; S. by Belgium ; and E. by Bhenish Prussia and Hanover. The boundary on this last side runs parallel to the Meuse in the S. and to the Ems in the N., but so as to include both banks of tlie former and exclude both"], [248, "Boon I. 232 THE NETHERLANDS. banks Oi the latter. The length of the country is estimated at 196 m. ; its extreme breadth at 109 m. ; its area at 10,905 sq. m. ; aud its population at 3,416,146. The Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg has been, since 1815, attached to the kingdom of the Netherlands by a personal union, and constituted the king a member of the late German Confederation. The greater part of the territory was lost by the Revolution of 1830, but the portion surrounding the town of Luxembourg remains, with an area of 990 sq. m., and a population of 202,313. By the arrangements made in 1867 this territory was neutralised, and the fortress of Luxembourg dismantled. 66. Amsterdam. Historical Geography. \u2014 The history of the Netherlands is identical with that of Belgium until 1579, when the five provinces of Holland, Utrecht, Zeeland, Gelderland, and Friesland established their inde pendence. In 1580 Overyssel joined the union, and in 1594 Gro ningen. Drenthe and North Brabant were subsequently acquired, and the latter is otherwise termed the \" Generalise' lands,\" as belonging to the states-general. Each of the seven provinces had its own states or assembly, and for matters of common interest there was a states general ; at the head of all stood a Stadtholder, who was a sovereign in all but the name. In 1794 the provinces were conquered by the French, and remained subject to them until 1813, when the house of Orange was reinstated. Military Geography.\u2014 The approaches to Holland from the S. and"], [249, "Chap. X. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY \u2014 CONFIGURATION. 233 S.E. are well guarded. On the side of Antwerp stand the strong for tresses of Bergen-op-Zoom and Breda ; the towns of Gertruidenberg and Willemstad on the S. branch of the Maas are also fortified. On the opposite side of the country Maastricht is the key of the mid-valley of the Maas, and lower down that river are the fortified towns of Venloo, Grave, and Dort ; between the Maas and Breda is Bois-le-Duc. The Waal is guarded by Nimeguen and Gorkum ; the Rhine, by Arnhem ; the Yssel, by Deventer ; and the Vecht, by Koevorden. Many of the seaports are fortified: this is the case with Helvoetsluys and Brielle, on the N. and mid-channels of the Maas ; the Helder, at the entrance of the Zuider-Zee ; Hoorn, on the W. coast, and Naarden on the S. coast of that sea ; and Harlingen. A peculiarity in the avail able means of defence is the possibility of flooding the low districts by cutting the dykes. Amsterdam needs no fortifications on this account ; the sluice-gates by which the neighbourhood can be flooded are at Muiden. Naarden is the key of the water communications. \u00a7 7. Configuration, Coast-line, Harbours, Dykes. \u2014 Holland is a vast alluvial plain with nothing resembling a rock within its whole area, and with only a few slight elevations in the provinces of Gelderland and Overyssel. About one-tenth of the present surface has been wrung from the sea by the exertions of the inhabitants, aiding and aided by the process of delta formation. Dykes line the coast, wherever dunes or sandhills do not exist : these last cover 140,000 acres, and are kept in their place by planting them with reeds. The chief features in the outline of the country are : \u2014 (1) The series of channels by which the Schelde and the Maas reach the sea, and which, intermingling with each other, form a perfect network of waters in Zeeland and South Holland. (2) The long peninsula projecting northwards between the Zuider-Zee and the North Sea, and which is continued in a line of islands (Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, and Ameland). (3) The Zuider-Zee itself, occupying an area of 12,000 sq. m. Lastly, (4) The Dollart, on the N.E. border. The country is amply provided with harbours : we may notice Flushing at the entrance of the West Schelde ; Helvoetsluys, on the middle outlet of the Maas ; Rotterdam, which is accessible by canal to vessels of 1000 tons ; Nieuwediep, which serves as the port of Helder, and which is both spacious and well-sheltered ; Hoorn, on the W. coast of the Zuider-Zee ; Amsterdam, at the S.W. angle ; and Haarlingen, in Friesland, whence a large cattle-traffic with London is carried on. Dykes. \u2014 The idea of reclaiming land by means of dykes is supposed to have been suggested by witnessing the effects of the raised causeways which tbe Romans made iu these parts for military purposes. Sea dykes were not constructed until the 13th cent. ; but the system had been applied on a small scale to rivers and islands for four or five centuries earlier. The spots selected for dyking are generally at the embouchures of rivers where sedimentary soil is deposited ; when the deposit has reached low-water mark, a temporary or \" summer \" dyke is erected in order to retain the slime deposited by the high tides. As"], [250, "234 THE NETHERLANDS. Book I. soon as the level has been further raised by this process, a permanent dyke is erected to keep out the high tides. The ground enclosed by the dyke is termed a polder, and is drained by means of sluice-gates opened at low water. The dyke is generally composed of sand and earth based on piles, and having the sea side faced with stone or bound with twigs. The size of these dykes varies : the Helder dyke is 40 ft. wide at the top, has a slope of 200 ft. to the sea, and is protected by immense masses of Norwegian granite. The dykes have a tendency to subside, and great expense is annually incurred in maintaining them ; in Zeeland alone the annual expense amounts to about 80,000i. Alterations in the Outline and Surface of Holland. \u2014 The antagonistic encroachments of the land on the sea and of the sea on the land have modified very materially the appearance of Holland. The ground re claimed is estimated at 877,240 acres, and the ground lost by the inroads of the sea at 1,581,000 acres ; but the value of the soil in the latter case is comparatively small, consisting chiefly of bog. The most serious loss has been by the irruption of the sea in 1287 into the Zuider- Zee, which was formerly (as its name implies) a southerly lake, ter minating northwards at the channel between Enkhuizen and Stavoren. The Gulf of Dollars was formed in 1277, and the Biesbosch in 1421. The greatest gain has been effected in the estuaries of the Maas and Schelde, and by the drainage of tbe Lake of Haarlem. In the former district, islands have been combined by tbe recovery of the intermediate channels : Walcheren, for instance, is made up of 10 islands, and Goeree and Overflakkee, which were formerly separate islands with an aggre gate area of 10,000 acres, are now combined in a single island of 60,000 acres. The Lake of Haarlem (45,000 acres) was drained in 1840-8, and the bed is now cultivated land ; previous to its drainage, its waters were a cause of incessant anxiety to the Government. \u00a7 8. Rivers. \u2014 The chief rivers of Holland are the Rhine, the Maas (Meuse), and the Schelde, which, crossing the country with torpid streams, intermingle in a network of channels. The course of the Ehine has been already traced (cap. 1, \u00a7 12) : it communicates with the Zuider-Zee through the Yssel and the Vecht; with the North Sea, through the branch which passes by Leyden, and which retains the name of the Rhine ; and with the Maas through tho Waal and the Leek. The Maas reaches the sea by three channels, of which the northern or Rotterdam branch retains tbe name of the river, while the two others are named after the towns of Goedereed and Brouwershaven : the middle channel is separated from the northern by the islands of Voorne and Beyerland, and from the southern by Overflakkee. At the head of its delta the Maas expands into a wide area with islands interspersed, named the Biesbosch. The Schelde has two channels, designated the East and the West Schelde, separated by the islands of Walcheren and the two Beve lands: the western or southern branch is the direct line of com munication with the sea. The southern branch of the Maas and the northern of the Schelde are connected by the channel which insulates Duiveland. The beds of the lower Maas, the Waal, and"], [251, "RIVERS \u2014 CLIMATE, INHABITANTS, ETC. 235 Chap. X. the Leek are elevated above the level of the adjacent country, and require to be dyked. \u00a7 9. Climate, Productions, Inhabitants, Government, &c. \u2014 The climate of Holland is affected by the large amount of water about it, and is humid and heavy. The mean temperature is about the same as in England, but slightly higher in summer and lower in winter. The canals freeze over in winter, and at such time skating is a general means of locomotion. Strong winds sweep over the country. The natural wealth of Holland consists in its rich soil, its fisheries, its waters as the means of communication, and its winds as the source of mechanical power, windmills being very numerous and applied to every purpose, draining, distilling, grinding, &c. Minerals are unknown, with the exception of turf, fuller's earth, and a small quantity of bog-iron. In regard to soil, the Netherlands may be divided into two nearly equal portions, in one of which clay, in the other sand, predominates. The clay district embraces North and South Holland, Zeeland, and parts of Overyssel, Gelderland, and Utrecht : the sandy district takes in the remaining portions of the last three provinces, together with Drenthe, Limbourg, and Brabant. The former yields admirable pastures, and two-thirds of the district ire under grass : the latter is generally poor, and nearly one-half of it is unreclaimed bog. Wood is chiefly found in Gelderland and Brabant : the area under wood is estimated at 562,500 acres. The inhabitants belong to various branches of the Low-German division of the Teutonic family : the Dutch, or Hollanders proper, are found ra the western provinces ; Friesians in the eastern provinces ; and Flemings in Brabant. They are a plodding, industrious, but unattractive people, phlegmatic in temperament, scrupulously clean in their houses and streets (Broek in N. Holland being notorious for its absurd degree of cleanliness), skilful gardeners, especially as regards tulips and other bulbous plants, and historically famous for the devoted patriotism with which they have defended their soil. Their reverence for the stork, which they encourage to build about their premises, is one ofthe national peculiarities. Government, Religion, Education. \u2014 Holland is a constitutional here ditary monarchy, with two legislative Chambers ; an Upper House of 39 members, holding office tor three years, and elected by the pro vincial states, and a Lower House of 72 members, holding office for two years, and elected by all citizens taxed to the annual value of 101. The executive is vested in the king with the aid of responsible ministers. About two-thirds of the people are Protestants, and one-third Roman Catholics. Among the former, the Calvinists or Dutch Reformed Church are most numerous, and tbe Lutherans come next ; the Jews number 64,070. Primary education is carried on by the Government and is very general ; the higher education is supplied by the Univer sities of Leyden, Utrecht and Groningen. The pauper colonies iu"], [252, "THE NETHERLANDS. Book I. 236 Drenthe for the reclamation of waste land, founded in 1818 by private benevolence, are a noteworthy institution. Agriculture, Manufactures, Commerce. \u2014 In agriculture the Dutch de vote their chief attention to dairy produce, for which they find a ready market in England. The round cheeses, with which we are familiar. are made at Edam and other places in North Holland ; Friesland pro duces butter of excellent quality. The dairies and cowhouses of Holland are models of cleanliness and economy. Tillage holds a sub ordiuate place ; but good crops of flax, hemp, madder, and clover are grown, in addition to the ordinary cereals. Friesland supplies a large number of fat cattle for the London market in addition to dairy pro duce. Nearly one-fourth of the surface of Holland is uncultivated, and of the remainder about one-fourth is under tillage and two-fourths under pasture. The manufactures axe chiefly for home consumption ; we may except from this description, however, the following branches which supply articles of foreign commerce : \u2014 gin, or \"hollands,\" which is largely distilled at Schiedam and elsewhere, sugar-refining, paper-making, dia mond-cutting, and type-founding. The fisheries are important : the herring fishery holds the first place, and is conducted chiefly from Vlaar dingen on the Maas ; cod are taken on the Dogger-bank ; and eels from the canals are brought over to London in tank-vessels. Commerce has been the foundation of and still remains an important element in the prosperity of the Netherlands. Amsterdam is one of the great financial towns of Europe ; and their colonies give the Dutch a command of various valuable articles, particularly tin, spices, and colonial produce. The mercantile marine amounts to 2289 vessels, with a capacity of 554,244 tons. The value of their external trade, exports and imports, amounts to about 70,000,000?. The imports are grain, timber, wine, and cotton goods ; and the exports, dairy-produce, flax, hemp, madder, flower-bulbs, and fish. The colonial commerce is excluded from the above list. Communications. \u2014 Water-carriage is found in all parts of the country. The canals are much broader than in England, 60 ft. being the general breadth. The most famous is that which connects Amsterdam with the North Sea at the Helder; its length is 51 m., breadth at the sur face 124 ft., depth 24 ft. By its means the circuitous and dangerous route by the Zuider-Zee is avoided. Railways radiate from Utrecht, N. to Amsterdam, N.E. to Zwolle, E. to Arnhem and the Prussian frontier, and S.W. to Rotterdam. The latter town is further con nected with the capital by a line passing through the Hague and Haarlem. \u00a7 10. Political Divisions.\u2014 The kingdom of the Netherlands (exclusive of Luxembourg) consists of 12 provinces, disposed as follows :\u2014 North Holland, between the Zuider-Zee and the North Sea ; South Holland, along the North Sea from near Haarlem to the S. outlet of the Maas, thus including the isles of Beyerland and Over flakkee ; Zeeland (i.e. sea-land), about the estuary of the Schelde, with the islands Schouwen, the two Bevelands, Walcheren, &c; North Brabant, S. of the Maas ; Limbourg, a narrow strip, embracing tbe right bank of the Maas opposite to Belgian Limbourg, and both banks farther down E. of North Brabant ; Utreoht, between the"], [253, "Chap. X. POLITICAL DIVISIONS \u2014 TOWNS. 237 Zuider-Zee and the Leek ; Gelderland, S.E. of the Zuider-Zee, and stretching S.W. to the Maas ; Overyssel, \" beyond the Yssel \" from Gelderland ; Drenthe, N. of Overyssel ; Friesland, in the angle formed by the Zuider-Zee and the North Sea; and Groningen farther E. along the North Sea. Note. \u2014 The names printed in thick type are the provincial capitals. \u00a7 11. Towns. \u2014 From the above table it appears that a consider able portion of the population of the Netherlands is gathered into the towns. Amsterdam, the capital, has a population of above a quarter of a million ; Rotterdam, the leading port, of above 100,000 ; the Hague, which serves as the seat of government, above 80,000, and then follow in order, \u2014 Utrecht, which combines the character of an educational and an industrial town; Leyden, to which the same description applies ; and Groningen, also the seat of a Uni versity : these are the only towns with populations exceeding 25,000. The appearance of the Dutch towns is peculiar : canals intersect them in all directions and carry the shipping into the main streets. The canals are lined with avenues of trees, and crossed by numerous bridges, Amsterdam having no less than 290. The aspect of the houses is quaint and cheerful. The Dutch towns rose to wealth for the most part in the 15th and 16th cents. ; but Dort was an important mart two centuries earlier. Noteworthy Objects. \u2014 Fine buildings are rare in Holland, partly from the absence of stone and partly from deficiency of artistic feeling. The palace at Amsterdam is the finest municipal building, dating from 1650 ; it is of stone, and more remarkable for size than beauty. The remains of the cathedral at Utrecht (choir and tower, the nave having been blown down) are handsome. The most noteworthy objects in Holland are the works already noticed : the gigantic dykes, particularly that of the Helder; the canals, particularly the great ship-canal to Amoter- Provinces. Towns.

Germany. \u00a71. Position, Boundaries, Size and Population. \u2014 Germany (Germ. Deutschland ; Fr. Allemagne) is an extensive region in the very heart of Europe, occupying the whole breadth of the continent between the Baltic and the Adriatic, the North Sea and the Alps, and stretch ing from the valleys of the Meuse and the Rhine in the W. to the Niemen and the Carpathians in the E. To define the precise extent"], [256, "GERMANY. Book I. 240 and population of Germany > is no easy task, inasmuch as it does not form a political whole. But if we include within it all the Prussian provinces (of which West Prussia, Posen, and Schleswig were ex cluded from the old German Confederation), and if we retain all that was formerly regarded as the German portion of Austria, the area will amount to 281,625 sq. m., and the population to 50,560,786. From the above rules are to be excepted all names of which we have adopted the French form. Such are common in Western Germany. Thus we use Cologne in preference to the German Koin, Treves for Trier, Munich for Miinchen, Nuremberg for Niirnberg, Ratisbon for Regensburg, Frankfort for Frankfurt (a change which disguises the meaning of the name, suggesting a connection with \"fort\" instead of \"ford,\" or passage), and sometimes Mayence for Mainz, and Cobleuce for Coblenz. \u00a7 2, Configuration and Natural Divisions. \u2014 Germany ex hibits every variety of natural conformation, from the loftiest Alpine summits to the flattest and most dreary plains. The northern por tion belongs to the Great Plain, which occupies the interval between the North Sea and the Teutoburger-Wald in the W., and gradually widens as it advances E. until it extends from the Baltic to the northern ranges of Bohemia. The southern portion is mountainous, and the difference of aspect suggests a natural division into High and Low Germany. The limit between these two is very distinctly marked on the side of Bohemia, where the Sudetes, the Biesen-gebirge, and the Erz-gebirge, form a connected wall, broken only at the gorge by which the Elbe escapes to the N. Westward of the Erz-gebirge the mountains become irregular and project north ward, and the line of demarcation between the North and the South is transferred to the river Main which takes up the line of the Erz gebirge. It will thus be seen that North and South Germany are \u25a0 German writers not unfrequently treat \" Deutschland \" as an ethnographical rathei Ihan a geographical term. Examples.

CLIMATE AND VEGETATION. mainly but not wholly identical with Low and High Germany, inasmuch as North Germany includes so much of High Germany as lies N. of the Main. The natural division here pointed out exercises a marked influence on the political relations, and even on the language, of the country. High Germany again falls into two great divisions, consisting of the Alpine region in the S. and the less lofty central region between the Danube and the Great Plain. These may be distinguished as the mountainous and the hilly regions respectively. The greater part of Germany slopes towards the N., in which direction flow five of its largest rivers, the Bhine, the Weser, the Elbe, the Oder, and the Vistula. The remainder slopes towards the E., and is included in the single basin of the Danube. \u00a7 3. Climate and Vegetation. \u2014 Two circumstances influence the climate of Germany, and make the variations to coincide rather with differences of longitude than of latitude. One of these is the gradual elevation of the level from N. to S., which goes far to neu tralise the effect of the lower latitude ; the other is the gradual loss of oceanic influence from W. to E., modified to a certain degree by the proximity of the Baltic in the extreme N. The effect pro duced by these combined causes is more observable in respect to the extreme than the mean temperature, the range of the thermometer increasing from W. to E. and from N. to S. : thus in the Bhine district and along the coasts of the Baltic the difference between the summer and winter temperatures amounts to about 31\u00b0 ; but at Dresden and Berlin it increases to 33\u00b0, and at Prague and Vienna to 36\u00b0. Bavaria, in the extreme S., is one of the coldest parts of Germany, and Munich has a lower temperature than Hamburg. The difference between the W. and E. is perhaps best shown by the effect on the rivers, the Bhine being frozen over on the average 26 days, the Weser 30, the Elbe 62, and the Oder 70. The mean annual temperature of the country may be put at about 48\u00b0, or nearly the same as that of the British Isles. The rainfall is greatest in the neighbourhood of the Alps, and least on the plains of Bavaria and Moravia, and on the inland part of the northern plain : the average fall in the latter district is about 19 inches. The vegeta tion of Germany resembles in its general features that of our own country : extensive forests clothe the mountains, as is implied in the frequent occurrence of the termination ' waid,' i. e. wood, in the names of the ranges : the oak and the beech predominate in the N.W., and elsewhere various kinds of pines, the stone-pine and silver-fir in the Alpine region, the Scotch fir on the sandy plains. The amount of forest-land is estimated at 26-6 per cent, of the whole area. The most marked variations in the vegetation are furnished by the vine and the maize, the former of which is confined to the MOD. GEO. M"], [258, "Book I. 242 GERMANY. region S. of the 52nd parallel, and thrives most S. of the 51st, while maize only ripens in S. Germany. \u00a7 4. Ethnography. \u2014 The Germans call themselves Deutsch, a name which, under a slightly altered form (Dutch), we have erro neously transferred to the inhabitants of Holland. They are the truest representatives of the great Teutonic family, to which we our selves belong. In respect to language, the Germans fall into two great divisions, designated High German and Low German or Platt- Deutseh. These divisions correspond generally with the great geo graphical divisions into High and Low Germany, Low German prevailing over the Plain to Dusseldorf on the Bhine, the Harz in Hanover, Wittenberg on the Elbe, and Krossen on the Oder. Each of these great divisions has several dialects ; the German of society and of literature is the Upper Saxon branch of High German, the su premacy of which is very much due to Luther's translation of the Bible. The leading features in the German character are attach ment to family-life, a patriotism which vents itself in aspirations after unity and in praise of their Father-land, industry and fru gality, a tendency to speculative thought (in which they hold the first place in the literary world), and a deliberateness in action, verging on slowness. Of the non-German elements in the population of Germany by far the most important is the Slavonian, which numbers above 8 millions, unequally divided between North and South Germany in the proportion of 2J millions to the former and 5J to the latter. The only other elements are about 1 a million of Boumans in Southern Austria, and an unimportant number of Lithuanians and Danes in parts of Prussia. These estimates apply only to those who still use their national tongues. A large number of Slavonians have become thoroughly germanised in Mecklenburg, Saxe-Altenburg, and elsewhere. About 7000 English are scattered over Germany, chiefly in the northern division. The population of Germany increases very slowly, in consequence of the immense emigration to America. \u00a7 5. North and South Germany \u2014 Their Political and Com mercial Belations. \u2014 North Germany is formed into a Confedera tion under the supremacy of Prussia ; South Germany is at liberty to form a similar Confederation ; but there seems no prospect of such a step being taken. Austria, though under a German dynasty and with a German capital, has so large a proportion of non-German elements in her population as to prejudice her in the eyes of the purely German states of the south-west \u2014 Bavaria, Wiirtemburg, &c. These therefore lean to the North, and have concluded a military convention with the Northern Confederation, whereby Prussia is virtually placed in command of their armies. They are also united to the North by the commercial bond of the Zollverein or \" Customs-"], [259, "Chap. XI. NORTH GERMAN COAST-LINE, &c. 243 Union,\" a voluntary association for the purpose of establishing uniform rates of duty on imports and exports. This association, commenced by Prussia for its own provinces in 1818, now extends over almost the whole of Germany (exclusive of Austria), and acts through a Parliament which meets at Berlin. North Germany. \u00a7 6. Coast-line and Islands. \u2014 North Germany possesses a sea board of about 350 m. on the North Sea and 850 m. on the Baltic. The coast of the North Sea is throughout low, and requires very generally to be dyked. A line of islands skirts the W. section of the coast of Hanover, and serves to shelter it from the violence of the waves ; nevertheless the sea has encroached, the large bay of Jahde having been formed by an irruption in 1511. The coast-line in this part is devoid of minor sinuosities, and the only openings in it are found at the embouchures of the rivers Ems, Jahde, Weser, and Elbe. The small isle of Heligoland, belonging to Great Britain, lies about 50 m. off the mouth of the Elbe. The W. coast of Schleswig- Holstein has suffered terribly from the sea, which has torn away large tracts from the mainland and converted them into islands (such as Sylt, Fohr, Hallig, &c), and is now gradually wearing away these islands. The present line of mainland is preserved in the N. of Schleswig by a natural breakwater of sand, called Uren, over which the sea occasionally bursts, and in the S. by lofty dyke3, as in Holland, by means of which very valuable pastures have been recovered. The chief opening in this section of the coast is at the mouth of the Eider. The E. or Baltic coast of, Schleswig-Holstein is perfectly sheltered, has sloping verdant banks, and is varied by a succession of deeply-penetrating inlets, such as those of Apenrade, Fleasborg, and Kiel. The Bay of Lubeck lies in the angle between Holstein and Mecklenburg, and thence the Baltic coast stretches E. to the Russian frontier. The most noticeable feature on this coast is the series of extensive lagoons (Haffs) which fringe it about the outlets of the rivers \u2014 the largest being the Stettiner Haff, connected with the Oder, and inclosing with the sea the islands of Usedom and Wollin, the Frische Haff, connected with the Vistula and the Pregel, and the Curische Haff with the Niemen ; these lagoons are generally separated from the sea by narrow sandy spits, which the Germans describe by the word Nehrung. The coast is very low in Pome rania and requires dyking : in Mecklenburg it is generally high, and in Samland, E. of the Gulf of Danzig, it is cliffy and much en croached upon by the sea. The coast-line of the Baltic is throughout regular, the Gulf of Danzig being the only extensive opening. The m 2"], [260, "Book I. 244 NORTH GERMANY. chief island off it is Ettgen, of irregular form, picturesque, well wooded, and fertile. \u00a7 7. Configuration \u2014 Mountains and Plains. \u2014 The limits of North Germany have been already sufficiently defined in \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 of this chapter. It falls into two great natural divisions, the Plain of the N. and E., and the diversified hilly region of the S.W. from the Harz and Thurmger-wald in the E. to the Eifel and the French frontier in the W. The hilly region may be divided into four por tions, the most southerly one of which connects at the Main with the Franconian plateau, and contains the well-defined woody range of Thuringer-wald, the mountain-knot of Fichtel-gebirge, the rugged Ehon of volcanic origin, between the Werra and the Main, the wooded Spessart almost inclosed in a fold of the Main, and the Vogels-gebirge, also of volcanic origin. The second region embraces the hills between the Bhine and the Weser, viz., the wooded and fertile Taunus between the Main and the Lahn, the Westerwald between the Lahn and the Sieg, the Sauerland between the Sieg and the Buhr, and the long sharply-defined range of Teutoburger-wald on the rt. bank of the Ems. The third region consists of the Harz district between the Weser and the Saale, of which the Brookea is the culminating point : it is divided into two portions, Upper and Lower Harz, the former in the N.W. The fourth region consists of the ranges W. of the Bhine, the wild volcanic heights of Eifel N. of the Moselle, and the Hundsriick between the Moselle and the Nahe. The Plain is not of a uniform level : it is traversed by two ridges of high ground, the northerly one of which is a continuation of the Uralo-Baltic plateau, and runs parallel to the Baltic through Prussia Proper, Pomerania, Mecklen burg, and Holstein ; while the southerly one is a continuation of the Uralo-Carpathian plateau, and may be traced in the Sandomir high land N. of the Carpathians, iu the Tarnowitz hills in Upper Silesia, in the Flaming on the right bank of the Elbe, and in the Luneburg heath on the left bank. Between these two ridges is a depressed basin falling towards the W. The northern ridge is distinguished by its vast number of lakes and by granite boulders. The Luneburg heath is a perfect sea of sandy heathy waste running parallel to the Elbe. About the lower Ems are the dreary moors of the Saterland. \u00a7 8. Hydrography \u2014 Bivers and Canals. \u2014 The general slope of North Germany is towards the N.W., three of the chief rivers, the Ehine, the Weser, and the Elbe, seeking the North Sea ; and three others, the Oder, the Vistula, and the Memel or Niemen, the Baltic. The chief affluents on the central plain exhibit with great uniformity a westerly tendency, and supply the links of a natural waterway through the heart of the country. Thus the Oder approximates to the Vistula by its double tributary, the Warthe with the Netze, and is approximated on the other side by the double tributary ofthe"], [261, "Chap. XI. HYDROGRAPHY. 245 Elbe, viz., the Havel with the Spree. Even farther west the sym metry of this arrangement is preserved in the double tributary of the Weser, the Aller with the Leine, which approximates to the Elbe. The above-mentioned tributaries join the trunk streams on the rt. bank : those on the 1. are generally more numerous but of smaller size, the most marked exception to the latter characteristic being the Saale on the 1. bank of the Elbe. Another special feature in the hydrography of the Plain is the tendency to lake formation : the Havel and the Eide, affluents of the Elbe, are the outlets of a complete network of lakes. The streams of North Germany aro generally slow and navigable. The Ehine has been already described (cap. i. \u00a7 12) as to its main stream. The portion which falls within North Germany contains the picturesque section between Bingen and Bonn, where the river, winding between lofty and steep banks, presents to the eye a succession of lake-like expanses, the natural beauty of which is enhanced by the numerous ruined castles which crown the commanding heights. Its chief affluents in North Germany are as follows : \u2014 rt., the Lahn, which drains the district between Taunus and the Westerwald ; the Sieg, between the Westerwald and the Sauerlaud ; the Wupper, well known from the industrial establishments on its banks ; the Ruhr ; and the Lippe, which rises on the Teutoburger Waid : 1., the Nahe, which joins it at Bingen ; the Moselle, which drains the region between the Eifel and the Hundsriick ; and the Ahr, which joins it above Bonn. The Weser rises in the Frankenwald under the name of the Werra : at Miinden it receives the Fulda from the Rhon-gebirge, and thence assumes the name of Weser. It has a general N. course, and the most noticeable point in it is the gorge called the \" Gate of Westphalia,\" which it traverses near Minden. Its affluents are 1. the Dimmel, and the Hunte ; rt. the Nesse, the Aller with the Ocker and the Leine, and the Geeste. The Elbe rises on the S.W. slope of the Riesen-gebirge, and takes a circuitous line S., W., and N. through Bohemia, from which it emerges by the fissure between the Riesen-gebirge and the Erz-gebirge, and thence passes through a varied country (the Saxon Switzerland) to the Great Plain, receiving 1. the Mulda from the Erz-gebirge, and the Saale from the Fichtel-gebirge with the Elster from the Erz-gebirge ; and rt. the Havel, which rises in the lakes of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and flows by Potsdam, receiving the Spree from the Riesen gebirge. The Oder rises in the Sudetes, enters the plain at Ratibor, and flows in a N,W. course, dividing in its lower course into two great arms, the eastern named the Eegelitz, while the western retains the name of Oder : these reunite below Stettin, and form the Stettiner-Haf, com municating with the sea by 3 channels, the Peene, the Swine, and the Divenou. The Oder forms vast marshes near Glogau, and numerous islands below Riistrin. In many parts it requires dyking. Its affluents are 1. the Neisse (of Glatz), the Katzbach, the Bober, and the Lower Neisse (of Gdrlitz); and rt., the Wartha, as large as the Oder itself, with the Prosna and the Netze. The Vistula rises in the Carpathian Mountains, approaches the Oder in its upper course, thence takes a vast bend through Poland N.E. and N.W.; re-enters Germany at Thorn, and shortly afterwards turns N. to"], [262, "246 NORTH GERMANY. Book I. the sea, which it reaches by two great arms, the N\u00bbgat E., and the Vistula W., the former discharging itself into the Erische-Haff, the latter directly into Danzig Bay. It receives no affluent of importance in Germany. Of the less important streams on the N. coast we may notice : \u2014 the Ems, which rises on the Teutoburger-Wald, and flows N.W. through a low and marshy country to the Gulf of Dollars ; the Eider, between Schleswig and Holstein, which crosses the isthmus from near Kiel to the North Sea ; the Trave, which joins the Gulf of Lubeck ; the War now, which flows by Rostock ; the Eeokenitz, between Mecklenburg- Schwerin and Pomerania ; the Peene, which rise3 more S. and flows N.E. to the Kleine Haff, receiving rt. the Tollense, and 1. the Trebel, which is connected with the Reckenitz by a canal ; the Persante and the Stolpe, between the Oder and the Vistula ; the Pregel, which joins the Frische-Haff; and the Niemen or Memel, which rises in Russia and joins the Curische Haff. Canals. \u2014 Of the above-mentioned rivers, the Vistula is connected with the Oder by the Bromberg Canal, which strikes across to the Netze ; the Oder with the Elbe by two canals, one of which (the Friedrich- Wilhelm) makes for the Spree, and the other (the Finow) for the Havel ; the Trave with the Elbe by the Steckenitz Canal ; and .the Rhine with the Danube by the Ludwigs Canal between the Altmiihl and the Regnitz branch of the Main. \u00a7 9.

The Confederation is represented in its relations with foreign countries by Prussia, and the same power holds the supreme military command. The states are represented in their corporate capacity by a parliament elected by universal suffrage, which hold3 its sittings at Berlin under the presidency of the King of Prussia. It consists of two bodies \u2014 a Federal Council of 43 members, 17 of whom represent Prussia, and a House of Representatives (Reichstag), elected at the rate of one member for every 1U0,0J0 inhabitants. I. Prussia. \u00a7 10. Position, Boundaries, and Population \u2014 Historical and Military Geography. \u2014 Prussia (Germ. Preussen; Fr. Prusse) stretches across the whole extent of North Germany, from Russia in the E. to France, Belgium, and Holland in the W. On the N. it occupies the whole of the German seaboard on the Baltic and the North Sea, with the exception of the sections owned by Mecklenburg and Oldenburg ; it also extends on the peninsula of Jutland between the two seas to about 55\u00b0 25' N. lat. On the S. it adjoins the Austrian provinces of Silesia and Moravia, Saxony, the Thuringian States, and Bavaria. Its boundary in this direction descends at each extremity to 50\u00b0 N. lat., but between these points it is carried up to about 51\u00b0 30'. The only outlying portion of Prussia is the principality of Hohenzollern in Wiirtemberg, the cradle of the present dynasty. The German nationality largely preponderates in Prussia, the sum total of inhabitants using other languages than German amounting only to 2-J millions, or about 13J per cent, of the population. Of these 2J millions, the bulk (2,356,000) are Slavonians in the following divisions : \u2014 (1) Poles (nearly 2 millions), in Posen, Prussia Proper, and Silesia ; (2) Masures (233,379), in East Prussia ; (3) Cassubes (7,652), in Pomerania and Prussia Proper; (4) Wends (82,232), in Brandenburg, on the banks of the Spree ; (5) Czeches (about 59,000), in Silesia. The Lithuanian tongue is spoken by 137,000 in East Prussia, about Gumbinnen ; the Danish hy about 152,000 in North Schleswig ; and the Walloon by about 11,000 in Bhenish Prussia. Influence of Position. \u2014 The position of Prussia, combined with the extent of her territory, conduces to render her one of the great military nations of Europe. With France on the one side and Russia on the other, she can hardly avoid being entangled in any continental question that may arise. As a naval power she can never rise beyond a second ary position ; the value of her coast-line is not proportioned to its length, and she would have formidable rivals even if she aimed at the command of the Baltic alone. The country is well adapted for internal as well as foreign commerce, and the absence of all natural barriers conduces to promote the unity and homogeneity of her population. To the latter feature she owes the supremacy she has obtained in"], [264, "Book I. 248 NORTH GERMANY. Germany; it has at once favoured her political and military organ ization, and has attracted to her the minor states, who haye regarded her rather than Austria as the representative of German nationality. Historical Geography. \u2014 The oldest portion of the Prussian territory lies on the 1. bank of the Elbe about Salzwedel and Stendal, where Henry I. established in 92S a margraviate as a barrier against the Slavonians. In the 12th cent. Albert the Bear, one ofthe margraves, extended his sway on the rt. bank of the Elbe to the Havel and the Spree, and assumed in 1142 the title of Margrave of Brandenburg. After various changes of rulers, these possessions were purchased in 1415 by Frederick of Niiremburg, a scion of the house of Hohenzollern. In the 17th cent, the house of Brandenburg rose to importance by the successive acquisitions of East Prussia from the Poles in 1618, Further-Pomerania by the extinction of the reigning house in 1 648, the principalities of Halberstadt and Minden by the treaty of Westphalia in the same year, the county of Ravensberg by inheritance in 1666, and the duchy of Magdeburg by treaty in 1680. In 1701 Prussia was constituted a kingdom, and her territory was greatly enlarged in the 18th cent, by the acquisition of Stettin, the southern part of Hither- Pomerania, and the islands of Usedom and Wollin from Sweden in 1720, of Silesia from Austria aa the result of the wars of 1740-42, 1744-45, 1756-63, West Prussia by the first partition of Poland in 1772, the territories of Danzig and Thorn by the second partition in 1793, and further portions of Posen by the third in 1795. In the settlement of Europe in 1815 Prussia regained Posen, which she had lost to Napoleon in 1807, and further acquired a part of Saxony, the Rhenish Province, Westphalia, Swedish Pomerania, and the isle of Riigen. Finally, in 1866, as the result of the war with Austria, she annexed Hanover, Electoral-Hesse, Nassau, Hesse-Homburg, portions of Hesse- Darmstadt and Bavaria, and Frankfort-on-Main, and obtained undivided possession of Schleswig-Holstein, which had been jointly with Austria conquered from Denmark. Lauenburg had previously been obtained in 1865 by the purchase of Austria's claim to a moiety. The princi palities of Hohenzollern in Wiirtemberg were ceded to Prussia in 1849, and the block of ground about Jahde in Oldenburg was purchased in 1854. Military Geography. \u2014 The protection of the W. frontier of Prussia is based on the Rhine, and the important points on that river are Mainz, Coblenz, and Cologne, at each of which it is crossed by bridges. Of these Mainz is the most important, both as being readily accessible from the French frontier, and also as commanding the valley of the Main. The approach to it is partly guarded by Saarlouis, a strong place on the frontier. Mainz itself is strongly fortified, and has a tete-du-pont at Cassel on the opposite bank of the Rhine. Coblenz is not so acces sible in consequence of the tortuous character of the Moselle valley aud the rugged country surrounding that valley, the approach to which is commanded by the strong but now neutralized position of Luxem burg. The passage of the Rhine at Coblenz is amply controlled by the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein ; and that at Cologne is protected by the fortifications of the town and by a tete-du-pont at Deutz. The N.W. frontier is guarded by Wesel, a first-class fortress at the junction of the Lippe and Rhine, and by Minden, on the Weser, in Westphalia. The heart of Prussia is most readily reached from the W. by the line of the Saale. The capital is protected on this side by Erfurt on the Gera, and Torgau, Wittenberg, and Magdeburg on the Elbe. On the side of"], [265, "Chap. XI. 249 PRUSSIA. Austria, Prussia is assailable either from Bohemia, which projects like the bastion of a fortress into the northern plain, or from Moravia by the upper course of the Oder. The fortresses of Glatz aud Neisse on the Neisse, Silberberg near Glatz, Schweidnitz on the Weistritz, and Glogau on the Oder, are effective for the protection of Prussia from either of the above quarters. On the side of Russia the Vistula is guarded by Thorn and Graudenz, and the Wartha by Posen, while on the coast Danzig is one of the strongest places in Europe, admitting of defence by inundation ofthe surrounding country; the other ports are all fortified, viz., Memel, Elbing, Konigsberg with Pillau at the entrance of the Frische Haff, and further W., Stolpe, Colberg on the Persante, Stettin on the Oder, and Stralsund, opposite Rugen. Berlin has near it Spandau, a first-class fortress with a manufacture of arms, and Kustrin, strongly posted at the confluence of the Wartha and the Oder. \u00a7 11. Harbours. \u2014 The extent of the coast-line possessed by Prussia has been already sufficiently indicated in \u00a7\u00a7 5, 10. The value of that extent is materially diminished by the scarcity of good harbours and by the comparatively small section which lies along the North Sea, and gives an open course to the Atlantic. On the North Sea the ports of Prussia from W. to E. are Emden, on the Dollart, shallow, but with a good roadstead ; Neu-Heppens, an embryo naval establishment on Jahde Bay ; Geestemiinde, at the confluence of the Geeste and the Weser, the rival of Bremerhafen ; Harburg, on the Hanoverian side of the Elbe, and Gluokstadt and Altona on the Holstein side, the latter close to Hamburg.1 On the W. coast of Schleswig-Holstein, Tonning, at the mouth of the Eider, carries on a considerable export business in agricultural products with England; and on the E. coast is Kiel Bay, the finest natural harbour on the Baltic, deep, landlocked, and roomy. On the S. coast of the Baltic the chief ports are Stralsund, opposite Biigen, spacious and safe, but with no river leading inland ; Swinemunde, on the isle of Usedom, at the neck of the Grosse Haff, an artificial rather than a natural port, and serving as the deep-sea port of Stettin, which itself lies about 40 m. up the Oder, and is only accessible to vessels drawing 7 or 8 ft. of water ; Neufahrwasser, at the mouth of the W. arm of the Vistula, the port of Danzig, which is 3 m. up the river, and can be reached only by vessels drawing 8 or 9 ft. of water ; Pillau, the port of Konigsberg, at the entrance of the Frische Haff, the inlet to which has a depth of only 12 ft. ; and Memel, at the entrance of the Curische Haff, a spacious and secure harbour. \u00a7 12. Political Divisions. \u2014 Government \u2014 Beligion and Edu cation. \u2014 Previously to 1866 Prussia was divided into 7 Provinces, 2 of which (Prussia Proper and Posen) were excluded from tho German Confederation, while 2 others (Westphalia and the Ehine- 1 Hamburg itself, though practically a Prussian port, is not on Prussian soil (see p. 261). M 3"], [266, "250 NORTH GERMANY. Book I. province) were separated from the bulk of the kingdom by the intervening territory of Hanover. Prussia thus fell into 3 divisions, of which the Eastern and Western coincided with the two portions above described, while the third, Central Prussia, contained the remaining provinces, Brandenburg, Pomerania, Silesia, and Prussian Saxony. The acquisition of Hanover in the N. and Hesse-Cassel and Nassau in the S. supplied connecting links between Central and Western Prussia, and has also altered the relative proportions of the divisions, so that Silesia may now be fitly transferred to the Eastern division. Hanover and Schleswig-Holstein now form separate provinces, and the other new territories are combined under the title of Hesse and Nassau, with the exception of Lauenburg, which is an appanage of the Crown. In the subjoined table the recent acqui sitions are specified in detail : \u2014 \u2666 Recent acquisitions. Government. \u2014 The government of Prussia is a Constitutional Mon archy, the executive being vested in the King aided by a Council of State and a responsible Ministry, and the legislative power being jointly exer cised by the King, a House of Lords, and a Chamber of Deputies appointed by a system of indirect election, the ordinary electors choosing a certain number of representatives at the rate of 1 for every 250 inhabitants, and these representatives in turn choosing the deputies. The assent of the King and the two Chambers is requisite to pass a law. The military system of Prussia secures to her a large army at a comparatively slight cost. Every Prussian, with the exception of the clergy and a few other classes, is bound to serve in the armv for a certain period, generally 5 years : he then retires into the landwehr or militia for 9 years, during which he ia liable to be recalled into the army PftOvrNCES.

PRUSSIA. in war-time : and after this period he joins the landsturm, for the defence of the frontier. Religion and Education. \u2014 The majority of the inhabitants of Prussia are Protestants. Roman Catholicism is, however, dominant in the Rhine-province, Westphalia, and Posen, and is on an equality with Pro testantism in West Prussia and Silesia. The Protestants are divided into Lutherans, Calvinists, and United Evangelicals \u2014 the last being a coalition of the two first. Primary education is provided by the State, and is compulsory on children between 6 and 14 years of age. For the higher education there are gymnasia or public schools, and universities (with the dates of their foundation) at Berlin (1810), Bonn (1818), Kiel (1665), Breslau (1702), Greifswald (1454), Halle (1694), Konigsberg (1544), Gbttingen (1737), and Marburg (1527). \u00a7 13. Natural Resources \u2014 Minerals and Soil \u2014 Agriculture, Manufactures, and Commerce. \u2014 Prussia possesses valuable coal fields in the Rhine-province (especially about Saarbriick near the French frontier, Stolberg near Aix, and Essen near Duisburg), as also in Westphalia, Saxony, Hanover, and Silesia. Much of the coal in Prussia is of the inferior quality called lignite, here designated \"brown\" coal (braunfcohl) as distinct from \"stone\" coal (steinkohl). The annual produce of the North German coal-fields (including Saxony) is about 19 millions of tons. The Harz region yields almost every kind of precious metal, including a small quantity of gold. Iron is found both there, in Westphalia, and in Upper Silesia ; zinc, in Silesia, the Bhine-province, and Nassau ; copper, chiefly about Mansfeld in Saxony ; lead in all of the above-mentioned dis tricts ; and salt at Luneburg in Hanover, and at Halle, Diirrenberg, and Schonebeck in Brussian Saxony. Amber is found on the coasts of the Baltic in Prussia Proper. The soil varies widely in character : the most fertile portions are situated in the Bhine-province, in Saxony, Posen, and Silesia : the least fertile are the marshes about the lower Ems, the heaths of Hanover (Luneburg) and Schleswig-Holstein, the depressed portion of the Plain between the Elbe and the Oder, the great heath of Prussia Proper about Tuchel, W. of the Vistula, and the lake district of Prussia Proper, E. of the Vistula. The northern provinces are on the whole more suited for grazing than for arable purposes : the river bottoms must be excepted from this de scription. Wood is abundant \u2014 the oak and beech in the hilly districts, and the Scotch fir on the sandy plains. Mineral Springs. \u2014 The most noted mineral springs of Prussia are situated at Aix-la-Chapelle in the Rhine-province, at Wiesbaden, Ems, and Selters (whence \" Seltzer water \") in Nassau, and at Homburg. Agriculture. \u2014 Agriculture is the chief occupation of the Prussians. The best cultivated districts are in the Rhine-province and in Saxony. Rye is largely grown on the poorer soils, and buckwheat in the sandy regions. Among other crops we may notice the large quantities of beet-root grown in Silesia and Saxony for conversion into sugar, and of potatoes for distillery purposes in the N.E. provinces; tobacco,"], [268, "Book I. 252 NORTH GERMANY. chiefly in Silesia and Brandenburg ; flax, on the Plain ; chicory, to ba used as a substitute for coffee ; rape and other seed-plants for oil; and dye-plants of various kinds. The cattle and horses of Hanover and Schleswig-Holstein are of a superior character ; and we may notice the fine-woolled sheep of Silesia, Brandenburg, and Saxony, the swine of Westphalia, the geese of Pomerania, and the bees of the heathy parts of Hanover. Vineyards. \u2014 Prussia possesses the finest of the German vine-districts, viz. the liheingau, on the banks of the Rhine, between Lorch and Walluf, where are situated the famous vineyards of Johannisberg, Steinberg, Riidesheim, and Markobrunner. Hochheim, from which is derived the name of \" Hock,\" improperly applied to all Rhine-wines, is situated outside the Rheingau, on the banks of the Main. The banks of the Moselle are well clothed with vineyards, some of which, as Brauneberger and Zeltingen, are of high repute. The vine is also grown on the banks of the Saale about Naumburg, on the Lower Neisse about Guben, and on the Oder about Griinberg; but the winea produced are of inferior quality. Manufactures. \u2014 The manufactures of Prussia are almost wholly for home consumption, and consist of various textile fabrics, iron, beet root sugar, spirit extracted from potatoes, and articles of art and luxury. The most active manufacturing districts are situated in the Rhine-province, Saxony, and Silesia, in each of which the supply of coal is abundant. In Western Prussia, the valley of the Wupper, near Dusseldorf, is the centre of tho most busy district in the whole of Germany. Here are situated Elberfeld and Barmen, which form a continuous town, the chief seat of the cotton manufacture and of other subordinate fabrics, and in the same neighbourhood Solingen (cutlery and arms), Rem scheid (hardware), and Crefeld, on the opposite bank of the Rhine (silk and velvet). Aix-la-Chapelle is another manufacturing centre, the products of which are chiefly needles and cloth, the latter especially at Eupen and Montjoie, the former at Aix, and both at Burtscheid ; the leather works at Malnae'dy are extensive. Essen, N.E. of Dusseldorf, is the seat of Krupp's famous steel-foundries. Westphalia carries on manufactures of linen at Bielefeld, Minden, Dortmund, Herford, and Soest, and of iron at Iserlohn, Altena, Bochum, and Schwelm, in the direction of the Wupper valley . In Hesse-Cassel, Hanau, near Frankfort on-Main, has various manufactures of silk, jewelry, and musical instru ments. In Central Prussia, Berlin is the seat of numerous trades chiefly of an artistic character, such as porcelain, the delicate iron-work known as \"Berlin ware,\" and philosophical instruments: in addition to these there are extensive foundries for machinery. Distilleries are nume rous in the province of Brandenburg, and there are manufactories of arms at Potsdam and Spandau, of woollen stuffs at Potsdam and Frankfort-on-Oder, and of cloth at Landsberg. In Saxony, beet-root sugar is one of the leading products : the other manufactures carried on in this province are cloth, woollen, leather, starch, distilling, and brewing : and most ofthe manufacturing towns, as Magdeburg and Hal berstadt, combine several of these businesses. Iu Eastern Prussia, Silesia produces linen, woollen, paper, and glass. The manufacturing places are chiefly situated between the Oder and the Riesengebirge, the linen and yarn beiug made on or near the mountains at Glatz, Hirschberg, Jauer, and Liegnitz. The cloth inanu-"], [269, "Chaf. XI. PRUSSIA. 253 facture is located at Liegnitz, Breslau, Gorlitz, and Griinberg ; Reichen bach is the centre of the Silesian cotton district. Schweidnitz is notice able for its gloves, Breslau for cotton-printing, Bunzlau for pottery, Glatz and its neighbourhood for glass. Commerce. \u2014 The chief exports of Prussia are timber, wheat, wool, oil, and flax: the chief imports are colonial produce, cotton, silk, coals, and iron. The mercantile navy has been largely increased by the acquisition of Hanover and Schleswig-Holstein, and now numbers above 5U00 vessels, carrying about 600,000 tons. Communications. \u2014 The rivers of Prussia furnish the means of trans porting heavy goods (and particularly timber) from the interior to the sea board. The canals which connect these have been already noticed. The railway system is tolerably complete as far as trunk-lines are concerned. The main routes from the W. enter Prussia at Aix-la-Chapelle from Bel gium and at Saarbriick from France : the former crosses the Rhine at Cologne, and is continued E. to Hanover, Magdeburg, Berlin, and on by Bromberg and Konigsberg to the Russian frontier : the other crosses the Rhine at Mainz, and strikes across from the Main at Frankfort by Giessen and Marburg to Cassel on the Fulda, and thence either N. to Hanover and Hamburg, or E. by Gotha and the valley of the Saale to Magdeburg, and thence to Berlin, as before described, as well as by a branch to Leipzig and Dresden. Important lines follow the Rhine, the Elbe, and the Oder, and serve to connect N. and S. Germany. The most direct routes from Berlin to Vienna are either along the Elbe by Dresden to Prague, Pardubitz, and Briinn, or along the Oder hy Frankfurt, Breslau, and Prerau: these two lines unite at Lundenburg, not far from Vienna. To Munich and the upper Danube the most direct route from Berlin is by Leipzig and the valley of the Pleisse to Hos and the upper Saale, and thence by the upper Main to Bamberg and the valley of the Regnitz, which it follows by Nuremberg to the Danube at Donauwbrth.

Boundaries, Physical Features, Population, and Re sources of Saxony. \u2014 Saxony is bounded on three sides.W., N., and E., by Prussia, from which it is separated by no natural boundary ,'"], [274, "258 NORTH GERMANY. Book I. and on the S. by Bohemia, from which it is parted by the Erz gebirge and the W. ranges of the Biesen-gebirge. It is of a tri angular form, the apex in the N.W. angle near Leipzig and the base abutting on the Erz-gebirge. The level of the country rises from N. to S., and the greater part of it is occupied by the terraces of the Bohemian ranges, which at Meissen subside into the plain. The proportion of plain to upland is as 1 to 4, and the upland is equally divided between the high ranges and the lower hills. The Elbe divides Saxony unequally into an eastern and western portion, of which the latter is the largest. The eastern portion is the more rugged of the two, and contains the peculiar district known as the \" Saxon Switzerland,\" which skirts the right bank of the Elbe from Pirna to the Bohemian frontier, and is composed of sandstone rocks, worn into all kinds of fantastic shapes. On the summit of an isolated obelisk of rock, 900 ft. high, stands the virgin fortress of Konigstein, overhanging the left bank of the Elbe. The population is very dense, amounting to 405 persons to the sq. m. : with the ex ception of about 60,000 Slavonians (Wends and Sorbs), it is German. The government is a constitutional monarchy. Lutheranism is the dominant religion, and education is compulsory. The resources of Saxony are considerable. The mineral products of the region about Freiberg are varied and valuable, salt alone being absent. The plain of the N.E. possesses a rich and well-cultivated soil, and large forests cover the higher mountains. The manufactures consist of linen, thread-lace, which is largely made in the mountains, porcelain of the finest and most artistic character, straw-plait, paper, and woollen stuffs. \u00a7 16.

Theik Distribution \u2014 Government \u2014 Religion and Edu cation\u2014Commerce. \u2014 The minor states of North Germany may be grouped in two divisions, according as they are situated on the Plain, or in the hilly region S. of the Harz and the Teutoburger-Wald. (1) The first group comprises Oldenburg, which touches the coast of the North Sea on each side of the Gulf of Jahde ; the Hanse Towns,1 1 The Hanse Towns are so named Irom the Hansa or commercial league formed in the 13th century for mutual protection."], [276, "NORTH GERMANY. Book I. 260 Bremen on the Weser, Hamburg on the Elbe, and Lubeck on the Trave \u25a0 Mecklenburg-Schwerin, which skirts the Baltic from the Gulf of Lubeck eastward to the Keckenitz ; Meoklenburg-Strelitz, S.E. of M.-Schwerin; Anhalt, on the Elbe, about the confluence of the Mulde ; Brunswick, which stretches across from the Alle to the Weser N. of the Harz, with a detached portion S. of that moun tain ; and the two Lippe Principalities, Schaumburg N. and Detmoid S. of the Weser, the latter adjoining the Teutoburger- Wald. (2) The second group comprises Waldeok, between the Diemel and the Edder in the upper basin of the Weser ; the portion of Hesse-Darmstadt, which lies N. of the Main ; the complicated knot of states about the Thiiringer-Wald, consisting of the Saxon Duchies of Meiningen, Altenburg, Weimar, and Coburg-Gotha, together with Sehwarzburg-Rudolstadt, and the two Beuss Principalities ; and, lastly, Sehwarzburg-Sondershausen, which lies on the Unstrutt, mid way between the Thiiringer-Wald and the Harz. The territories of the above states are in many cases singularly dis jointed. Brunswick consists of 6 detached pieces, the two chief of which are separated by a slip of Hanover; a third lies S.E. of the Harz, while the others are situated at Ottenstein, W. of the Weser; Theding hausen, near Bremen ; and Calvbrde, in Prussian Saxony. Oldenburg owns the principality (not the town) of Lubeck on the Baltic, and Bir kenfeld on the Nahe, W. of the Rhine. Lubeck and Hamburg are the joint possessors of Vierlande, a territory 16 sq. m. in size between the Elbe and the Bille. Coburg and Gotha, though united under the same ruler, are on different sides of the Thiiringer-Wald, and there are no less than 9 detached fragments combined with these in one state. Altenburg is intersected by the Reuss district of Gera ; it further pos sesses 12 fragments outside its main territories, and includes within it3elf 4 fragments belonging to other states. And, to cite but one other instance, Weimar embraces the three main divisions of Weimar on the Saale, Eisenach on the Werra, and Neustadt on the Orla, a tri butary of the Saale, and 24 fragments scattered over an area extending from N. to S. 32 m., and from E. to W. 50 m. Government, Religion, Education, Commerce. \u2014 The minor states have a monarchical government, with the exception of the Hanse Towns. The titles of the sovereigns are as follows : \u2014 For Hesse-Darmstadt, the Mecklenburgs, Saxe- Weimar, and Oldenburg, Grand-Duke ; for Bruns wick, the three other Saxe states, and Anhalt, Duke ; and for the re mainder, Prince. Representative institutions are established in all the states except Reuss-Greiz and Sehwarzburg-Sondershausen, but the arrangements and powers vary widely. In the Mecklenburgs feudal institutions hold their ground, and the representation consists of Knights' Estates meeting in Diet. In the larger states there are two chambers, in the smaller only one : in Anhalt and Reuss-Schleiz, the chamber has a merely nominal existence : in the Lippes its functions are deliberative only. The rulers are generally supported by a civil list, but in many cases by domains. The Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz owns half of his duchy, and the Duke of M.-Schwerin about one-fifth of the duchy, together with the railroad : the Prince of Reuss-Greiz"], [277, "Chap. XI. SAXONY AND THE MINOR STATES. 261 owns the bulk of his principality : and several of the other sovereigns, Brunswick, Saxe-Weimar, and Saxe-Coburg, have large private fortunes. The Hanse Towns are governed by municipal councils, consisting of a Senate, charged with the executive, and a House of Burgesses or Legis lative Assembly. The bulk of the inhabitants belong to the Lutheran shurch. Primary education is decidedly low in the Mecklenburgs, and by no means advanced in Oldenburg ; elsewhere it varies in sufficiency. There are universities at Rostock in Mecklenburg, founded in 1419, at Giessen in Hesse-Darmstadt (1607), and at Jena in Saxe-Weimar '1557). The manufactures are of no special importance, and are chiefly designed to meet local demands. Foreign commerce is carried on from the Hanse Towns, but more particularly from Hamburg, and on a Bmaller scale from the ports of Mecklenburg aud Oldenburg. The exports are chiefly agricultural produce, wool, cattle, corn, and oil seeds, and the imports colonial produce, cotton, coal, and iron. The commerce is chiefly carried on with Great Britain. The commer cial marine of Hamburg numbers 536 vessels, carrying 240,000 tons \u2014 of Oldenburg 637 vessels, carrying 68,000 tons; of Mecklenburg 419 vessels, carrying 151,740 tons, and of Bremen 312 carrying 220,000 tons. \u00a7 18. Towns \u2014 Noteworthy Objects \u2014 Historical Associations. \u2014 Of the towns in the minor states the most important is Hamburg, the chief commercial port of all Germany, aud the entrepot for British and American trade. Bremen, on the Weser, is the great port for emigration, and then follow at a wide interval the ports of Liibeok, Wismar, and Rostock on the Baltic, the two latter in Meck lenburg. Hamburg can be reached by ships of burthen, but occasionally large vessels transship their cargoes at Cuxhaven, the pilot-station at the mouth of the river. Bremen and Lubeck have their deep-sea ports at Bremerhafen and Travemunde, at the mouths of the Weser and the Trave respectively. Of the inland towns we may notice Brunswick, the seat of a large agricultural business, particularly in wool, and of various manufactures : Mainz,1 in the extreme S., on the Bhine, with a large transit commerce and sundry manufactures : Giessen in Hesse - Darmstadt, and Jena in Saxe- Weimar, the seats of universities of high standing ; Weimar, famed in the literary world as the home of the poets Wieland, Herder, Schiller, and Gothe ; Pyrmont, in Waldeck, a watering-place of celebrity ; Gera, in Beuss-Schleiz, and Zerbst, in Anhalt, places of local importance in regard to manufactures. Coburg has a special interest for us Englishmen from the various ties between its Ducal house and our own Boyal Family.

Extent, Configuration, and Divisions of South Germany. \u2014 The southern division of Germany embraces all that lies S. of the Main and of the mountain-wall which forms the line of demarcation between Upper and Lower Germany on the side of Bohemia, as described in the preceding chapter, \u00a7 2. It is the smaller of the two divisions, being l-4th less, both in area and in population. In its general aspect it presents a marked contrast to the northern"], [280, "264 SOUTH GERMANY. Book I. division : in lieu of tbe uniform low plain, which constitutes the bulk of North Germany, we have here a diversified region exhibit inc almost every kind of natural conformation \u2014 the lofty and intri cate ranges of the Alps, the broad terraces of the Upper Danube, the undulating country about the Neckar, the river plains of Lower Austria about the Danube and March, and the sharply defined quadrangular basin of the Upper Elbe. These several districts are parted off from each other by natural boundaries, which have to a certain extent a political significance. It is particularly noticeable that the western portion of South Germany has a character of its own ; the high plains which surround the Upper Danube, and which merge into the undulating country about the Eegnitz, are severed from the more easterly district by the mountains which close in the valley of the Danube near Passau. The westerly portion belongs equally to the basins of the Danube and the Ehine, which here meet and may be said even to merge together on the plain between the Eauhe Alp and the Franconian Jura. It also forms a distinct political region, inasmuch as it is occupied by the purely German (as distinct from the Austrian) states. It is, further, the only portion of South Germany which lies open to the north: for though the upper basin of the Elbe is included hydrographically in the northern slope, yet it is so shut off from the plain that its communications are more open to the S. than to the N. With this exception, the eastern portion of South Germany belongs wholly to the basin of the Danube, and slopes generally towards the E. The names, areas, and populations of the states are as follows : \u2014 \u00a7 2. Natural Features of South -West Germany. \u2014 The western portion of South Germany falls into two divisions coinciding with the basins of the rivers Danube and Rhine. The basin of the Danube is defined by the Schwarzwald, the Kauhe Alp, and the Fran conian Jura; the first separating it from the Ehine itself, the second from the Neckar, and the third from the Eegnitz, a branch of the Main. The bulk of this region consists of high ground, the only exception being the narrow strip which fringes the Ehine and State. Area in sq. m. Population.

BAVARIA AND THE MINOR STATES. which is parted off from the interior by the Schwarzwald S. of the Neckar, and by the Odenwald between the Neckar and the Main : these descend sharply on the side of the Ehine, but are little else than the rims of the high plains, which slope off gradually on the other side. The Suabian plateau, which surrounds the Danube, is both the highest and the flattest ; the Franconian plateau, about the Neckar and the Eegnitz, is undulating. The Suabian Plateau. \u2014 The average elevation of the Suabian Plateau may be from 1,500 to 2,000 ft., Munich itself standing at an elevation of 1,676 ft. The central plains are dull and monotonous, and the rivers which cross them are not unfrequently fringed with morasses of great extent. On the S. these plains are succeeded by wooded hills, with pleasing valleys and a belt of picturesque lakes of which the Chiem, the Wurm, and the Ammer are the largest. The most striking features in the upper course of the Danube are the defile of the Lange Wand, near Weltenburg, and the Donaumoos or moor between Neuburg and Ingolstadt : its tributaries on the right are Alpine streams, of which the Iller and the Lech hold parallel courses from S. to N., while the Isar and the Inn form another pair from S.W. to N.E. : the Isar and the Inn carry off the surplus waters of the lakes above noticed. Tlie Franconian Plateau. \u2014 The Franconian plateau bas the form of a triangle, of which the apex is formed by the convergence of the Sohwarzwald and the Rauhe Alp, while the base stretches from the Fichtel-gebirge to the Vogelsberg on the right of the Main. It is more varied and broken than the Suabian plateau, and has its openings towards the Rhine at the gaps through which the Neckar and the Slain find their outlets. The most striking portion of this plateau is the valley of the Wiesent, near Muggendorf, called the \"Franconian Switzerland.\" The scenery elsewhere is pleasing both from natural features and from the general fertility of the country. The chief tri butaries of the Neckar are the Kocher and tbe Jaxt ; and of the Main the Regnitz, which is formed by the junction of the Pegnitz and the Rednitz ; and the Tauber. ]. Bavaria and the Minor States. \u00a7 3. Productions \u2014 Government, &c. \u2014 The kingdom of Bavaria, (Germ. Bayern) consists of two detached territories of unequal size, the larger one in the basins of the Danube and the Main, the other (ahout 2,250 sq. m. in area) on the 1. bank of the Ehine. The resources of Bavaria are considerable : the mineral products are coal (the yield amounting to about 200,000 tons annually), iron, salt, quicksilver (in Ehenish Bavaria), lithographic stone, &c. : about 62 per cent, of the land is under culture, and among other crops may be mentioned hops, the best tobacco in Germany, and spelt. The richest corn lands are in the plain of the Danube below Ratisbon, and on the Main, between Ochsenfurth and Schweinfurth. The vine flourishes on the banks of the Main and in Ehenish Bavaria, and in less perfection on the Danube and the shores of Lake Constance. The highlands of the S. are devoted to grazing, MOD. geo. n"], [282, "Book I. 266 SOUTH GERMANY. and the mountains aie covered with forests to the extent of about one-third of the whole area of the country. Manufactures, &c. \u2014 \u25a0 The manufactures embrace beer, for which Bavaria is especially famous, iron-making, and various artistic works in the form of toys, clocks, mathematical instruments, furniture, bronze- work, leather, &c. The people are exclusively Germans; the government is a constitutional monarchy, and nearly three-fourths of the people are Roman Catholics. Education is compulsory, and there are three universities, Munich and Wurzburg for Roman Catholics, and Erlangen for Protestants. The kingdom is divided into eight circles or provinces. \u00a7 4. Towns \u2014 Notewoethy Objects \u2014 Histobical Associations. \u2014 The towns of Bavaria are interesting both historically and archi tecturally. Munich, the capital, stands on the banks of the Isar in the southern part of the kingdom : it is for the most part of modern erection, and contains some fine collections of works of art. *tTnrem berg, on the Pegnitz, is remarkable for its medi\u00e6val aspect: it attained to great wealth in the 15th and 16th centuries as an entrepot for the commerce of Italy and the Levant, and also as a manufacturing town for all kinds of metal-work : it is still an important place both of trade and manufactures, particularly of toys, metal-work, and wood-carving. Augsburg is a town of the same character in all respects as Nuremberg, and commands the trade with Italy. Ratisbon, at the junction of the Begen with the Danube, was formerly the seat of the Diet, and the chief place of traffic for the Danube : it is now comparatively unimportant. We may further notice the fortresses of Ingolstadt and Passau, on the Danube, and Landau and Gemersheim, near the Bhine ; the manu facturing towns of Reichenhall in the S. (salt), Bayreuth, on the Main (leather), Amberg (iron), and Hof (linen). In Bhenish Bava ria, Spires is the chief town.

It thus includes a portion of the basin of the Upper Danube, but has its greatest expansion in that of the Neckar. Baden adjoins Wiirtemberg on the W., and is divided between the . valley of the Rhine and the ridges which we have described as forming the edges of the plateaus : it extends from the Lake of Constance (where it crosses the Rhine so as to include the town of Constance) to the Main at Wertheim, expanding towards its N. and S. extremities, and contracted in the centre to a breadth of about 12 m. near Rastatt. Hesse-Darmstadt, S. of the Main, occupies both banks of the Rhine, the western division being dis tinguished as Rhenish-Hesse and the eastern as Starkenburg. The Prussian principality of Hohenzollern lies across the Rauhe Alp, sur rounded by Wiirtemberg. The diminutive principality of Liechten stein is on the Upper Rhine above the Lake of Constance.

Fruit is produced in great quantities in both districts, including the vine, of which there are famous vineyards on the Rhine in Rhenish-Hesse (Nierstein and Liebfrauenmilch). The forests are extensive. Of minerals, Wiirtemberg is rich in salt at Schwabisch-Hall, and also possesses iron. The mineral waters of Baden are much visited. Government, Education, $c. \u2014 The states above mentioned are all monarchies, the titles of the sovereigns being in Wiirtemberg, King; in Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt, Grand-Duke; and in Hohenzollern and Liechtenstein, Prince. Representative institutions are in operation in all except Hohenzollern, which is an appendage of the Rhine-province of Prussia. As to religion, Protestantism prevails to the extent of two-thirds of the population in Wiirtemberg, one-fourth in Baden, and three-fourths in Hesse-Darmstadt. Education is very advanced, par ticularly in Wiirtemberg, where it is rare to find a person unable to read and write, and whence have come some of the most famous men of Germany \u2014 Schiller, Wieland, Schelling, Hegel, Danneker, and others. There are universities at Tubingen in Wiirtemberg, and at Heidelberg and Freiburg, in Baden. Manufactures, de.\u2014 In the forest districts of Baden and Wiirtemberg the wood is converted into clocks, toys, and household implements . the so-called \"Dutch\" clocks chiefly come from this neighbourhood. Paper is manufactured on a large scale in Wiirtemberg, and there are manufactures of woollen and hardware at Esslingen and Heilbronn in that country, and of carriages at Offenbach in Hesse-Darmstadt, the same place being also famous for bookbinding. \u00a7 6. Towns \u2014 Noteworthy Objects \u2014 Historical Associations. \u2014 The towns of the minor states call for little notice. Stuttgart, on the Neckar, is the capital of Wiirtemberg ; Carlsruhe, in the valley of the Rhine, of Baden ; and Darmstadt, in the Bergstrasse, of Darmstadt : the two latter owe their importance entirely to their official position : Stuttgart, as the chief town on the Neckar, has a more solid basis for its prosperity. The fortresses of Bastatt and Ulm are of value for the defence of the frontier. Mannheim is well situated for commerce at the junction of the Main and Rhine.

Extent and Population \u2014 Influence of Position \u2014 His torical and Military Geography. \u2014 The Austrian Empire is a vast aggregation of states and nationalities, united under a common ruler, but imperfectly fused as respects political institutions. Taken"], [286, "THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE. Book I. 270 at its full extent, it stretches through nearly 9 degrees of latitude from the extreme S. of Dalmatia to the frontier of Saxony, and through 17 degrees of longitude from the Lake of Constance in the W. to the outer bend of the Carpathians in the E. : it has an area of 240,351 sq. m., and a population of 32,572,932. The empire falls into two great divisions which meet at the river Leitha in the neighbourhood of Vienna, viz. : Austria, the empire proper, com prising the Cis-Leithan or German provinces together with Galicia, Bukowina, and Dalmatia ; and Hungary, or the Trans-Leithan section, which forms a separate kingdom, independent of Austria as regards its internal administration, but united to it by the per sonal bond of a common ruler, as well as by various common interests of a financial or military character. Influence of Position. \u2014 Austria is pre-eminently the \" Empire of the Danube : \" she holds the whole central basin of that river where its expansion is greatest and its boundaries best defined, and consequently she exercises vast influence in both directions, E. and W., along that stream. If we look at the portions of her territory that he outside that basin, we shall find that some are more intimately connected with it than with any other region. This is the case with Bohemia, which, though on a northern river, belongs to Upper Germany, and is more open to the Danube than to the northern plain. It is so again with the W. coast of the Adriatic, which lies so immediately on the verge of the Save section of the Danube basin as to form a natural appendage of it. The upper basin of the Adige would seem more properly to belong to Italy, but it is so readily accessible from the valleys of the Drave and the Inn, that it has always been more or less occupied by a German population, and perhaps the true boundary on this side would be found, not at the head of the valley, but at a point above Trent, about the confluence of the Rosbach and the Avisio, where the valley is contracted by protruding ridges. North of the Carpathians the wide expanse of plain occupied by Galicia is wholly detached from the Danube. Both this and the Trentino are probably sources of weakness to the empire. Austria is essentially an inland country : she possesses, indeed, an outlet at the head of the Adriatic, together with a long stretch of coast between that sea and the Dinaric Alps ; but the region is too remote and the sea too enclosed ever to admit of Austria succeeding as a naval power. The commercial route down the Adriatic is, however, of great value to her, and the possession of Dalmatia prevents the Adriatic from becoming an Italian lake. The proximity of the Austrian Empire to the Black Sea, and its position on the great westerly route of the Danube, have conduced to the remarkable and even dangerous admixture of race and language, German, Maygar, Slavonian, and Rouman, within her borders, rendering an adjustment of political rights extremely difficult, particularly as regards the Ger man and non-German elements. Historical Geography. \u2014 Both the name and the state of Austria originated in the establishment of a border province between the Enns and the Raab by Charlemagne in 791, which was the most easterly poition of his vast empire (Oesterreich meaning \"eastern kingdom\"), and which was intended as a barrier against the Avars. From 984 to 1246 this province was held by the Bavarian Counts of Babenberg, who"], [287, "271 Chap. XII. MILITARY GEOGRAPHY. added to it Austria above the Enns in 1156, and Styria in 1192. On the extinction of the Babenbergs, the sovereignty was given in 1251 to Bohemia, but was wrested from that power in 1273 by the Hapsburgs, in whose hands it still remains. The vast territories of this house were acquired at the dates and in the methods here specified :\u2014Carin thia, with Carniola, in 13.15, by the death of the last Count of Tyrol ; Tyrol, in 1363, by the bequest of Margaretha, the daughter of the count just mentioned ; Trieste, by cession, in 1382 ; Austrian Istria, Gorz, and Gradisca, in 1500, by inheritance ; the Hungarian kingdom, including Bohemia and Moravia, in 1526, by the marriage of Ferdinand with the daughter of Lewis II. ; Croatia, in 1527, by the choice of the people ; Transylvania, in 1699, by purchase ; Slavonia, in 1699, by conquest from the Turks ; Eastern Galicia, in 1772, by the first parti tion of Poland; Bukowina, in 1777, by cession from Eussia; West Galicia, in 1795, by the third division of Poland; Venetian Istria, in 1797, by the peace of Campo Formio ; the Bishoprics of Brixen aud Trent, in 1803, by annexation; Dalmatia, in 1814, by the peace of Vienna ; Salzburg, in 1815, by the peace of Vienna, it having been an independent bishopric until 1802; and the city of Cracow, in 1846, by annexation. Military Geography.\u2014 The chief object of the military operations undertaken against Austria has generally been to reach the plain on which the capital stands; the counter object of Austria has conse quently been to guard the approaches to the Danube from the W. The river can be reached by two routes from the French frontier, viz. : by a direct route from Alsace through the defiles of the Black Forest, or by a circuitous route through the valley of the Main. The former route abounds in strategical positions, and is partly defended by the fortress of Rastatt in Baden : it is also guarded on the Danube itself by the strong fortress of Ulm, in Wiirtemberg. The route of the Main turns the latter position, but is long and difficult. Tho Danube can further be approached through Switzerland, by crossing the Rhine between Basle and Schaffhausen, and thence striking across the Black Forest ; or again, by crossing the Rhine above the Lake of Constance, and following the difficult route of the Arlberg by Feldkirk aud Iunsbruck. The first of these two routes is commanded by the defiles leading up to the Black Forest, as at Engen and Stockach ; the second traverses Alpine gorges, which are defended by forts at various points, particularly at Kufstein, below Innsbruck. Lastly, the Danube may be reached through Lombardy and Venetia by the upper valleys of the Drave and the Mur. The upper basin of the Danube itself is throughout difficult for military operations ; the 1. bank below Ulm is skirted by heights commanding the rt. bank, and has very few affluents : on the other or S. side of the river numerous and important affluents pour down from the Alps, offering successive defensive Hues, and gene rally commanded by some one or more strong positions. Thus, the Iller is commanded by Memmingen ; the Lech by Augsburg, as well as by Fussen in the upper valley, and by Rain at its confluence ; the Isar by Landshut ; the Inn by Kufstein below Innsbruck, and by Braunau at the confluence of the Salza ; the Salza, by Salzburg ; the Enns, by Steyer ; and the Trasen by St. P\u0153lten. On the side of Italy, the upper Drave is defended by Klagenfurt, and the Mur by the important post of Bruck. The approaches to Vienna from the N. are defended \"ly Olmutz on the March, and by Josephstadt and Koniggratz in Bohemia."], [288, "Book L 272 THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE. \u00a7 8. Political Drvisioss. \u2014 The Austrian Empire is divided into 19 crown-lands or provinces, as below : \u2014 German Provinces. \u2014 Of these crown-lands, the first 1 1 belong to Ger many, with the exception of a portion of Istria (distinguished as Venetian Istria) to the extent of 1283 sq. m., which on historical grounds ha3 been excluded. On the other hand, a portion of Galicia (the Duchies of Ausschwitz and Zator) on the Vistula, with an area of 952 sq. m., formed part ofthe old Confederation, though under Galicia for administrative purposes. The total area of Austria within Germany is thus brought to 76,288 sq. m. The population of this portion is returned at 12,802,944 ; but the particulars of this estimate as regards Istria, the Galician Duchies, and the military, are not clearly ascer tainable. \u00a7 9. Population. \u2014 The population of the Austrian Empire is com posed of the following principal elements : Germans (in round numbers), 8 millions ; Slavonians, 15 millions ; Maygars, 5 millions ; Roumans, 2J millions, leaving about 1\\ millions of sundry races. To put the computation in another form, about i of the population is Slavonian, l-4th German, l-6th Maygar, and l-12th Rouman. The Slavonians are divided into two great branches, north and south, numbering 11 millions and 4 millions respectively. The North Slavonians comprise the Czeches with the Slowacks (6 mil lions), the former in Bohemia and Moravia, the latter in E. Moravia and N.W. Hungary ; the Ruthenians or Russniacks (3 millions), of S.E. Galicia and N.E. Hungary; and the Poles (2 millions), of Galicia, and parts of Silesia and Bukowina. The South Slavonians comprise the Wends of Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, and the Coasi- Crown-lands. Area in sq. m. Population. 1. Lower Austria 2. Upper Austria 3. Salzburg 4. Styria 6. Carinthia 6.

The Maygars in a compact body occupy the great plains of Hungary. The Roumans are most numerous in S. E. Hungary, Transylvania, where they supply more than half the population, and Bukowina. Jews are very numerous in Galicia, and Gypsies in Hungary, and about the Lower Drave. The Germans are found in every province (Dalmatia excepted) in varying proportions : monopolizing Austria proper (with the exception of Vienna itself which contains about 19,000 Slavonians) and Salzburg ; constituting the majority in Styria, Carinthia, and Tyrol ; a moiety in Silesia; a third in Bohemia, where they are found encircling the Gzeches in the centre ; a fourth in Moravia (on the N. and S. borders and in the towns) ; an eighth in Hungary, where they are found in great numbers on the course of the Danube and at the foot of the Northern Carpathians, in the Banat, along the Maros, and in the towns ; a tenth in Transylvania, where colonies were introduced from Lower Germany so far back as the 12th century, whioh retain their nationality with great distinctness about Herrmandstadt and Cronstadt in the S., and Bistritz in the N.E. ; about a twelfth in Bukowina ; and elsewhere (in Galicia, Croatia, Slavonia, the Coast-land, and the Military Frontier) a mere sprinkling. A further point of comparison is the pro portion of Germans in the two great divisions of the empire, viz. : in the German provinces about 6 millions as compared with about 7 mil lions of non-Germans, and in the other provinces about 1| millions as compared with 18 millions of non-Germans. Ofthe non-German races the Maygars present the most compact front to the Germans. Government. \u2014 Austria is a constitutional monarchy, with a repre sentation of a somewhat complicated character. Each crown-land has its own diet, consisting of representatives of the nobility, clergy, landed gently, chambers of commerce, towns, and rural population: these meet in a single chamber and regulate matters of provincial adminis tration. In addition to these, there is an Imperial Council, consisting of two chambers, (1) a House of Lords, composed of princes of the blood royal, the heads of the great families, archbishops, and bishops of princely rank, and nominees of the Emperor ; and (2) a House of Deputies, elected by the diets of the various crown-lands, and out of members of those bodies. The above particulars apply to the Cis- Leithan section, including Dalmatia, Galicia, and Bukowina. Hungary is also a constitutional monarchy with its own separate diet (re-esta blished in 1867), which meets at Buda, and is composed of the 4 estates of the kingdom \u2014 Prelates, Magnates (high functionaries and imperial barons), representatives of the nobles, and of the Royal Free Cities. Croatia and Slavonia have shown some reluctance to a constitutional union with Hungary, and have refused to send representatives to the Diet, maintaining their own right to a separate Diet at Agram, and claiming the restoration of the \" triple kingdom\" of Slavonia, Croatia, and Dalmatia, as a separate member of the empire. The \" dual \" principle will, however, be forced upon them. The common affairs of the two great sections are managed by a mixed body, to which each section furnishes 60 delegates. Religion and Education. \u2014 The great bulk of the population of the empire (nearly 2-3rds of the whole) is attached to the Roman Catholic N 3"], [290, "Book I. 274 THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE. Church. The remaining l-3rd is classified as follows :\u2014 Greek Catho lics (Ai millions), chiefly in Galicia, where they equal the Roman Catholics, the remainder in Hungary, Transylvania, &c. ; Independjnt or non-united Greeks (3 millions), differing from the last in that they only acknowledge the supremacy of the Archbishop of Carlowitz, most numerous in Bukowina, Southern Hungary, Transylvania, and the Military Frontier ; Protestants (3 millions), divided unequally between Calvinists and Lutherans, the former numbering about 2 millions ; and Jews (1 million). Primary education is very general in the German provinces, but is embarrassed in the E. and S.E. by the great diversity of languages, which sometimes necessitates the use of three or four languages in a single school. The higher education is conducted in 256 public schools (gymnasiums) and the 7 universities of Vienna (founded in 1365), Prague (1348), Cracow (1343), Pesth (1794), Inns bruck (1826), Gratz (1826), and Lemberg (1816). \u00a7 10. Natural Resources \u2014 Minerals and Soil \u2014 Agriculture -Manufactures\u2014 Commerce \u2014 Communications. \u2014 The natural resources of the empire are of the highest order, but are very imper fectly developed. Minerals are abundant in the regions of the Alps, the Bohemian Erz-gebirge, and, above all, the Carpathians. Of the precious metals, gold is found in considerable amounts in Hungary and Transylvania, and in small quantities in Salzburg ; silver, in Hungary and Bohemia ; and copper in Tyrol, Styria, Bohemia, aud the Carpathian region. Iron is abundant in Styria and Carinthia ; lead is found in Carinthia, and quicksilver at Idria in the same province ; zinc, in Carinthia and Tyrol ; and tin, in Bohemia. There are extensive beds of coal in Styria, Carinthia, Bohemia, Moravia, and the Banat ; and of salt, in Galicia and Salzburg. The supplies of timber are inexhaustible on the Carpathians, and the forests of the German provinces cover a third of the cultivable area. The soil varies, but is generally fertile : a large proportion of the German provinces consists of mountain or highland, amounting in Tyrol to 2-5ths of the whole province : nevertheless, even in this portion of the empire, it is estimated that 6-7ths of the surface is serviceable. The most fertile regions are the plains of Lower Hungary, particu larly the Banat, Moravia (the plain of the March), parts of Bohemia, lower Austria, and the coast-land of the Adriatic. Mineral Springs. \u2014 Bohemia abounds with valuable mineral springs, among which those at Toplitz, Marienbad, Eger, and Karlsbad are best known. Baden, in lower Austria, Gastein, in the Tyrol, and the Hercules baths, near Mehadia, in the Banat, are also much frequented. Agriculture.\u2014 The crops cultivated in the Austrian empire are wheat, on the plains, that of the Banat being the finest in the world ; maize, in the valleys of the Drave and Save, and along the Lower Danube ; buckwheat on the high grounds ; flax and hemp particularly in Galicia, and also in parts of Hungary ; hops of excellent quality in Bohemia ; tobacco in central Hungary about Debreczin. and in Slavonia ; rape and other oil-seeds in Hungary ; and fruit in Bohemia, Transylvania, and Hungary. The plains of Hungary, between the Theiss and the"], [291, "Chap. XII. NATURAL FEATURES. 275 Danube, sustain large droves of horses and cattle ; the Alpine districts are the chief breeding-ground for cattle, and the sheep of Bohemia and Moravia produce fine wool. The methods of farming are unscientific. Vineyards. \u2014 Hungary possesses some of the finest vine-districts in the world, the most noted being about Tokay on the slopes of the Hei galla, and about Menes, E. of the Theiss; good wines are also produced about Lake Balaton, and in the neighbourhoods of Magyarat, Oedenburg, Erlau, Buda. and Pressburg. Croatia, Slavonia, and Trau sylvania are also very favourable to the vine. The wines of Austria Proper aud Styria are abundant, but of inferior quality. In Bohemia, the wine grows well on the Elbe, near Leitmeritz, and in Tyrol, about Botzen. Manufactures. \u2014 The manufactures of Austria are almost wholly con fined to the German provinces, and even there are carried on languidly. Iron is largely worked in Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, and Upper Austria, and the other minerals of these regions supply the chief industrial occu pations in them. Bohemia is, generally speaking, the most decidedly manufacturing district of Austria: linen, cotton, and woollen fabrics are the staple products, and are largely manufactured iu the hilly dis tricts of the it. and E., particularly about Reichenberg (woollen), Jung-Buntzlau (linen and woollen), Leitmeritz and Gitschin (linen). The glass of Bohemia has a world-wide fame. Moravia is also much engaged in the woollen business, and has in Brunn the largest manu facturing town of the empire, with the exception of the capital, Vienna, which is the seat of numerous artistic manufactures, such as jewellery, glass, carriages, porcelain, silks, books, &c. Silks and cotton fabrics are made at Neustadt, and in the villages about Vienna. Commerce. \u2014 The foreign commerce of Austria is on a restricted scale, and seeks its outlet chiefly by way of the Adriatic. Its exports are wool and woollen goods, linen, glass, leather-work, tobacco, grain, and wine : its imports, cotton, colonial produce, hides, &c. Communications. \u2014 The lines of railway connecting Vienna with North Germany through Brunn and Prerau have been already noticed in the previous chapter. In addition to these, access is gained from the W. and N.W. by a line which follows the Danube to Linz and Ratisbon, with a branch to Munich. The Brunn line connects Bohemia with the capital, and the Prerau line communicates with Cracow and Lemberg, in Galicia, and on to Czernowitz, in Bukowina. From Vienna an important line runs S. to Trieste, through Gratz and Laybach : at Bruck it is met by a branch, which passes through Styria and Salzburg to Munich : a line has also been carried over the Brenner Pass into Northern Italy, communicating between Verona and Munich. The Danube route is continued below Vienna by Presburg to Pesth, whence it strikes across the plain, cutting off the angle formed by the river, to Weisskirchen, in the S.E. angle of Hungary. From this trunk line branches are formed to Arad, Grosswardein, Debreczin, and other places. \u00a7 11. Natural Features of Austria \u2014 The Alps \u2014 The Danube \u2014 The Bohemian Basin \u2014 The March. \u2014 Austria is bounded W. by Bavaria and Switzerland ; S., by the Alps, except where it crosses them into the basin of the Adige, and by the Adriatic ; E., by the Carpathians and the non-German provinces; and N. by the northern Bohemian ranges and Prussian Silesia. It contains"], [292, "THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE. Book I. 276 the following geographical regions: \u2014 (1) The Austrian Alps. (2) The valley of the Danube with the plain of Lower Austria. (3) The Bohemian basin. (4) The basin of the March or Morawa. To these we may add, as distinct but less important divisions, the belt of land at the head of the Oder and Vistula, occupied by Silesia, and the coast district at the head of the Adriatic. We append some particulars as to these regions : \u2014 (1.) The Austrian Alps. \u2014 The Austrian Alps connect with the Swiss Alps in the ranges that enclose the Engadine, and continue eastward to the termination of the system. The central line, or main chain, con tains the following groups or heights from W. to E. : the Oetrthaler Fenier, W. of the Brenner Pass, and the Venedigen E. of that pass, the Dreiherren-spitz, at the head of the Salza, the Rienz, and a branch of the Drave ; the Gross-Glockner, and the Angokl, overhanging Gastein. From this section of the Alps numerous groups ramify over the sur rounding country. On the S. the basin of the Adige is hedged in by the Ortler and Tridentine Alps, which last are connected but slightly with the main chain at the plateau of Toblach : on the N., the following groups may be noticed : \u2014 the Arlgau or Vorarlberg Alps, between the Upper Inn and the Lake of Constance ; the Bavarian Alps, between the Lech and the Inn ; the Salzburg Alps, between the Inn and the Salza, liuked to the main chain at the Gerlos Pass; and the Salzkam mergut Alps, between the Salza and the Enns. The valley of the Drave is enclosed on the S. by the Carnic Alps, which continue to the head of the Save and then branch off into the Kara wankas and the Julian Alps, enclosing the basin of that river on the N. and S. The main chain N. of the Drave divides at the head of the Mur into two branches, one of which (the Lower Tauern) fills the interval between the Enns and the Mur, while the other, under the gene ral name of the Styrian Alps, skirts the right bank of the Mur, and again divides, sending one branch S.E. between the Mur and the Drave, under the name of the Carinthian Alps, while the other proceeds N.E. across the Mur to the Semmer ing and the Wiener- Waid. The most peculiar feature in the scenery of South Germany is furnished by the dolomite moun tains of the Italian Tyrol in the valleys of Fassa, Gader, and Gro- Ijinsbosel.

Passes. \u2014 The most important pass in the Austrian Alps is the Brenner, where a considerable depression takes place, opening a com paratively easy route between the valleys of the Inn (by the Sill) and the Adige (by the Eisach). W. of the Brenner the Stelvio pass connects the basins ofthe Inn and the Adda; the road crosses the shoulder of the Ortler group, and is the highest carriage-road in the Alps. It was constructed in 1828 at a vast expense by the Austrians. (2.) The valley of the Danube, between the Inn and the March, is hemmed in by mountains between Passau and Effarding, and again between Ardagger and Krems. These sections are divided by the plain or basin that surrounds Linz, and which extends some distance up the Traun. Below Krems the valley expands into a broad plain divided into two sections by the protruding ridges which penetrate to the river at Korneuburg and Klosterneuburg. The lower section, which surrounds Vienna, extends up the valley of the March, and is known as the Austrian plain : it includes the rolling prairie-like Marchfeld, the great battle-field of Austria, on the N. side of the Danube. The chief affluents of the Danube from the Alps in this part of its course are the Inn, which divides Austria from Bavaria, and has an important affluent in the Salza or Salzach, flowing from the Salzburg Alps ; the Traun, which drains the district called, from its abundance of salt, the Salzkammergut ; and the Enns. (3.) The Bohemian basin is enclosed by the ranges noticed in chap. 1, \u00a7 6. These ranges are not furnished with a continuous crest, but have numerous depressions by which access can be obtained to the adjacent countries : this is more particularly the case on the S.E., where the Moravian heights are little else than a series of plateaus, and on the S.W., where the Bohmerwald is readily crossed into Bavaria : on the N. the deep gorge of the Elbe below Tetschen opens a way to Saxony. Within the bounding ranges the level of the ground falls by three terraces from S. to N., the central one being divided from the southern or upper one by the rivers Wottawa and Luschnitz. and from tha northern by the Beraun and the Sazawa. The northern terrace ter minates N. at the Eger and the Elbe, on the other side of which the mountains begin to rise. Several plains are sunk deeply in the terraces ; that of Budweis in the upper one, that of Pilsen in the central one, and those of the Elbe and Eger in the lower one. The hydrography is symmetrical : the Moldau divides the country into equal halves, and receives the 3 pairs of streams noticed in the descrip tion of the terraces. (4.) The basin of the March is enclosed between the Moravian heights and the Carpathians. The former descend to tbe valley of the March by a series of terraces, which diminish in breadth and height from S. to N., the highest portion being in the S.W., between the Thaya and the Schwarzawa. The March flows in a low plain and receives the Thaya, a stream of nearly equal volume with itself, which intercepts through the Schwarzawa the greater part of the drainage from the Moravian heights. \u00a7 12. Distribution of the Gis-Leithan Provinces. \u2014 The geo graphical distribution of the Cis-Leithan provinces is as follows : \u2014 Lower Austria, on both sides of the Danube, from the March to the Enns ; Upper Austria, also on the Danube, from the Enns to the Inn ; Salzburg, in the basin of the Salza ; Styria (Germ. Steiermark), a"], [294, "THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE. Book I. 278 high region occupying the upper basins of the Enns and the Mur, and stretching across the Drave to the Save; Carinthia (Karnthen), on the Upper Drave; Carniola (Krain), on the Upper Save; Gorz and Istria, between Carniola and the Adriatic ; Tyrol (with Vorarlberg on the Lake of Constance), on both sides of the Alps, about the upper basins of the Inn, the Lech, the Adige, and the Drave ; Bohemia (Bohmen), in the basin of the Upper Elbe ; Moravia (Mahren), in the upper and mid-basin of the March ; and Silesia (Schlesien), on the N. slope of the Sudetes and the Carpathians, about the head waters of the Oder and the Vistula. \u00a7 13. Towns \u2014 Noteworthy Objects \u2014 Histobical Associa tions. Vienna, the capital of the Austrian Empire, stands on the right bank of an arm of the Danube, about 2 m. S. of the main stream. It consists of two parts \u2014 the Old Town, which is circum scribed by the line of the old fortifications ; and the suburbs, which surround the old town in all directions with broad and regular streets radiating from it as from a centre. The glacis of the old fortifications, which are now demolished, is converted into ornamental grounds. One of the suburbs lies across the arm of the river, and contains the Prater or park and the Augarten or public gardens. The whole town is surrounded by fortifications. Prague, the ancient capital of Bohemia, is centrally situated on the Moldau, the bulk of the town on the right bank, the Hradschin or palace, with other buildings, on the left bank : the ground rises on each side from the river and gives the place a very imposing aspect, which is enhanced by the numerous spires and domes of the buildings : it is the focus of the commerce of Bohemia. Trieste is the only large port possessed by Austria, and is regarded as the \" Southern Hamburg : \" it stands an the E. shore of the Gulf named after it, in a crescent form \u2014 the old town on rising ground, the new town on a small plain between the old town and the sea : the harbour is formed by a mole Provinces.

Gratz, the capital of Styria, owes its prosperity to its favourable position, midway between Vienna and Trieste, and with routes leading E. and W. along the Mur : it is beautifully situated, and is entitled the \" Little Vienna.\" Briinn, the capital of Moravia, has been noticed as the first purely manufacturing town in the empire. Linz, the capital of Upper Austria, is well situated at the point where routes converge to the Danube from Bohemia in the N. and Salzburg in the S., and is an important military post. We may further notice Innsbruck, the capital of Tyrol, on the Inn, as its name ( = Inn-bridge) implies, surrounded by magnificent scenery ; Salzburg, on the Salza, yet more beautifully situated ; Trent, the chief town in the Italian Tyrol, on the Adige ; Olmutz, a strong fortress in Moravia ; and Pola, in Istria, a fortified port and arsenal, the chief naval station of the Austrians.

Galicia and Bukowina. \u2014 The Galician region consists of the slopes and terraces of the Carpathians, which resolve them selves northward into extensive plains divided by low ridges. The S. and W. portions are the most rugged. The region is divided between the basins of the Vistula and the Dniester, the watershed between which lies on a range of heights running N.E. between the 23rd and 24th meridians. The San is the chief branch of the Vistula in this region. In addition to the above rivers, the head-waters of the Moldawa, the Sereth, and the Pruth are situated in the S.E. angle. The mineral products of the Carpathians are very various, but the most remarkable is the immense bed of rock-salt which fringes the base of the range, and is largely worked at Wieliczka and Bochnia, near Cracow. The climate is ungenial, the winters being protracted and severe. The mean annual temperature at Cracow is 47\u00b0 ; the mean winter 27\u00b0, and the mean summer 66\u00b0. The soil of the plains is productive, and yields, in addition to the ordinary cereals, tobacco, flax, and hemp. The region is unequally divided between Galicia and Buko wina, the latter in the S.E. angle, adjacent to Transylvania and Roumania. The towns are unimportant, with the exception of Lem berg, the capital of Galicia, centrally situated, and the seat of a university and other public institutions; Cracow, on the Vistula, the ancient capital of Poland, and still an important centre of com merce, though shorn of much of its glory ; and Czernowitz, the capital of Bukowina, well situated for commerce on the Pruth.

The Hungarian Region \u2014 Carpathians \u2014 Plains of the Danube and Theiss Rivers. \u2014 The Hungarian region, in its widest extent, includes not only the country properly so called, but the The Danube below Fre^buig. other Trans-Leithan provinces of the empire, and Dalmatia, which is politically attached to the Cis-Leithan section. This region pre sents remarkable contrasts of highland and lowland, the central plains about the Theiss being encircled by a broad band of moun tains, viz., the Carpathians on the N. and E., and the continuations of the Alps en the W. and S. The latter have been already suffi ciently described ; it remains for us to give some particulars as to the Carpathians, the Plains of the Danube, and the rivers of the plain, viz., the Danube, the Theiss, the Drave, and the Save. (1.) The Carpathians. \u2014 The outer rim of the Carpathians is formed in the W. by the Little Carpathians, bounding the valley of the March; in the N.W. by the Jabiunka range, from the pass of that name east ward j in the N.E. by the long line of the Great Carpathians; and in the S.E. by the Southern Carpathians. The two latter divisions are more usually designated the \"Western\" and the \"Eastern,\" but an inspection of the map will show the inappropriateness of these titles. Between Jabiunka and the Great Carpathians the interval is filled up by the Bahia Gora and Beskid ranges, S. of which rises the lofty mass of Tatra, like a huge bastion, moated round by the deep valleys of the Dunajec and Poprad, the Waag, and the Arva. The loftiest points of this mass are Gerlsdorfer Spitze (8685 feet), and Lomnitzer Spitze, which is about 50 feet lower. S. of Tatra, the whole interval between"], [298, "282 THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE. Book I. the Waag in the W., and the Hernad, a tributary of tbe Theiss, in the E\u201e is filled up by the ranges of the Hungarian Erz-Gebirge ( = Mineral Mountains). In the S.E. the angle between the Southern and tbe Great Carpathians is covered with extensive ramifications, rendering Transylvania a lofty and rugged plateau, rising to the S. and E\u201e and culmiuating in Mount Negoi ( 8345 feetj, though the first place is more commonly assigned to Butschedje. (2.) The Plains of the Danube and Theiss. \u2014 There are two plains in this portion of the Danube basin: \u2014 (1) the upper or lesser plain, extending from the gate of Theben or Deven on the Austrian frontier to the point where the Bakonyer-Wald sends its offsets to the right bank of the Danube near Gran ; and (2) the lower or great plain of Hungary, which extends along the Danube from the point where the river turns S. to the gorges of the Carpathians below Belgrade. The upper plain expands on the right bank of the river, and is apparently the dry bed of a former inland sea, of which the shallow Neusiedler lake may be the remains. The great plain has its greatest extension along the Praia. course of the Theiss (about 300 miles), and occupies an area of 21,000 square miles. The most remarkable portion of it is the region between the Theiss and the Danube (the \"Mesopotamia\" of Europe), which is composed of interminable treeless plains, called Pusztas, yielding in places extensive pasture grounds which support vast herds of horses and cattle, aud elsewhere consisting of mere seas of sand or dried beds of lakes, occasionally white with crystallized salt. (3.) Rivers.\u2014 The Danube furnishes the great artery of communica tion between the Hungarian plain and the outer world ; the principal peculiarity in this part of its course is the formation of branches, which enclose occasionally very long islands, such as the Great and Little Schiitts, the former 42 miles and the latter 25 miles long ; this tendency is strongly exhibited below Presburg. The Theiss is pre eminently the river of the Hungarian plain ; it rises in the angle where the Transylvanian highlands join the main Carpathian range, and flows W., S.W., and S. to the Danube with a sluggish meandering stream, which occasionally overflows its banks, and devastates the adjacent land ; it intercepts on its left bank the rivers from the Transylvanian"], [299, "Chap. XII. HUNGARIAN REGION. 283 highlands, particularly the Szamos,* the triple-branched Koros, and the Maros, the largest of the Transylvanian streams. The Drave and the Save join the Danube on its right bank, the one above and the other below the Theiss j the Drave enters the plain on the W. border of Hungary, and the Save at Agram ; the two rivers are divided by a ridge known as the Warasdin mountains. An extensive lake, called Balaton, or the Plattensee, occupies a low basin between the Bakonyer- Wald and the Danube. The Neusiedler lake, already noticed, lies below the level of the Danube at Theben. The lower Theiss and Danube are connected by the Franz canal. \u00a7 16. Political Divisions and Inhabitants. \u2014 The Hungarian region is divided into the following provinces : \u2014 (1.) Hungary, which exceeds all the rest put together in area, and is the leading state of the group, extending from the March and the Drave to the Carpathians and Transylvania, and holding the great plain of the Theiss to the Maros in the S. (2.) Woiwodschaft Servia and the Temeser Banat, on the southern portion of the great plain on both sides of the Theiss, between the Maros E. of that river, and the Danube W. of it, together with a small district S. of the Danube, called Sirmia; the Banat is the portion E. of the Theiss, and bounded S. by the Military Frontier, which here crosses the Danube ; the portion W. of the Theiss is called the Bacska. (3.) Croatia and Slavonia, the latter on the right bank of the lower Drave and the Danube, the former between the mid Drave and the Adriatic. (4.) Transylvania, on the high and rugged plateau between the southern and eastern Carpathians. (5.) The Military Frontier, a long strip stretching from the Adriatic to Transylvania along the courses of the Save and Danube, together with detached portions, one between Croatia and Slavonia, the other between Croatia and Carniola, the whole being arranged for the defence of the border against Turkey, and the land being held on a system of military tenure. (6.) Dalmatia, along the E. coast of the Adriatic, in a long and gradually narrowing strip, fringed by a series of islands, of which we may notice Cherso, Pago, Grossa, Brassa, Lesina, Curzdla, MeWda, and Lissa, the last with an excellent port, and altogether the most flourishing of the group. Population. \u2014 The population of the Hungarian region presents an extraordinary admixture of races. In this respect Hungary has been termed \"Europe in miniature,\" most of the great branches of Euro pean ethnology being represented there. The dominant race is the Maygar, of Mongolian origin, still speaking an agglutinative language, and retaining much of the nomadic character of their ancestors, living on the plains, inveterate riders, teuacious of the customs of their fore fathers, active in war, but otherwise indolent. Next to them come the Slavonians of various branches : Slowacks in the N.W. Carpathians, Ruthenians in the N.E., Croats and Servians in the S. The Eouman race * The final s in these river names is pronounced as sch, and the z following the s in Sixmos is practically omitted."], [300, "THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE. Book I. 284 is also largely represented, particularly in the S. along the Danube. Germans occupy the fourth place, being very numerous along the Danube and in the Carpathian valleys, and holding parts of Transyl vania. Intermingled with these are large numbers of Gypsies and Jews, and in the S. a sprinkling of Armenians, Albanians, and Italians. \u00a7 17. Towns \u2014 Notewoethy Objects \u2014 Histobical Associa tions. \u2014 Many of the places named in the above list are classed as villages or market-places, and not as towns proper, inasmuch as, in spite of their great populations, they have not the privileges or or ganization of a town. This is the case with Czaba, reputed the largest village in the world, with nearly 28,000 inhabitants; and again with Mako, Bekes, and others, in Hungary ; Sign and Imoschi in Dalmatia ; and Baja in the Woiwodschaft. The towns proper are comparatively few; foremost is the twin capital Pesth-Buda, with a joint population of nearly 200,000 : Pesth, on the left bank of the Danube, stands on a plain, and is a modern town, with broad regular streets and fine buildings ; Buda, on the opposite bank, is an old town built on the slope of a hill, the summit, of which is crowned by the fortress containing the government offices. The other towns on the Danube are Presburg, near the Austrian frontier, the old capital of Hungary ; Komorn, at the extremity of the Great Schutt, an impregnable fortress, the treasury of the empire when Vienna is endangered ; Gran, the ecclesiastical metropolis ; Neusatz, an entre pot for the commerce of the Danube ; Peterwardein, on the opposite bank, designated the \" Gibraltar \" of the Danube, a title more appro- Peovinces, &c.

Several of the towns in the basin of the Theiss are fortified, with a view to command the passes into Transylvania or across the Carpathians ; this is the case with Caransebes on the Temes, and Temesvar on the Bega, a first-class fortress ; Neu-Arad, on the Maros, and the large commercial town of Szegedin, opposite the confluence of that river with the Theiss ; Gross-wardein, on the Koros; Unghvar and Munkaos, on branches of the Bodrog, each with a strong citadel. In Croatia and Slavonia, Agram is an important commercial entrepot ; Warasttin and Eszek, on the Drave, are important fortresses, and Alt-Gradiska is the chief post on the Save. On the coast of the Adriatic we may notice the sea-port towns of Piume, on the Gulf of Quarnero ; Zara, Spalato, Eagfisa, and Cattaro, on the Gulf of Cattaro : the last is one of the best ports on the Adriatic, the others are indifferent. Noteworthy Objects. \u2014 Buda Fortress, with modern fortifications, and containing the Royal Palace, originally the residence of the Palatine of Hungary, and a Chapel in which tbe crown and regalia are deposited ; Turkish Baths, dating from the time that the Turks held Buda ; the Suspension Bridge, with a central span of 627 feet, across the Danube to Pesth ; National Museum at the latter place.

Position, Area, and Population \u2014 Historical and Mili tary Geography. \u2014 Italy is the central one of the three peninsulas of Southern Europe, lt projects into the Mediterranean between the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian seas in a south-easterly direction, and is connected with the mainland by the broad basin which intervenes between those seas and the crescent-shaped circuit of the Alps. The crest of the Alps forms the N. boundary of Italy as a geo graphical region; but the political boundary falls short of this limit in the upper valley of the Ticino, which belongs to Switzerland, in the upper valley of the Adige or Southern Tyrol, which belongs to Austria, and at the head of the Adriatic, where Istria and Gorz are also Austrian. At the head of the Gulf of Genoa France has"], [303, "287 Chap. XIII. POSITION, AREA, &c. acquired the Italian districts of Nice and Monaco, and the bounaary leaves the Alps at the Col di Tenda, instead of at the head of the river Var. The islands of Sicily and Sardinia belong to the king dom of Italy ; but Corsica, which is also Italian in point of position and language, is under French rule. The length of Italy proper from the Alps to C. Spartivento is about 750 m. ; the breadth varies from 330 m. in the N. to a minimum of 15 m. between the Gulfs of St. Eufemia and Squillace, amounting in the central region to about 110 m. The shape of the peninsula closely resembles that of a high-heeled riding-boot, the heel at C. Leuca, the toe at Sparti vento, and the spur at Gargano ; and the parallel may be completed by likening the northern section of Italy to the overlapping folds of a \" knickerbocker.\" The areas and populations of those portions which are under Italian rule (islands included) are as follows : \u2014 The kingdom of Italy has such a preponderating influence that it seems hardly necessary to give a separate division to the Papal States in the following pages.

Historical Geography. \u2014 The kingdom of Italy, as such, dates no farther back than 1861. The reigning dynasty originally held Savoy, whence they extended their sway into Piedmont, and finally acquired, in 1720, Sardinia, with the title of king. The first important addition to their territory was Genoa in 1815. Nothing further was gained until 1859, when the Austrian province of Lombardy was ceded. In State. Area in sq. m. Population.

The last great accession was that of Venetia in 1866. The only remaining sovereignty in Italy is the Papacy, which is now restricted to Rome, the surrounding region of Comarca, and the Delegations of Viterbo, Civita Vecchia, Velle'tri, and Frosindne. The miniature republic of San Martino, near Rimini, dates from the 4th century, and has preserved its independence intact to the present day.

Military Geography. \u2014 The basin of the Po has in all ages been the battle-field of Italy, and this not only on account of its remarkable adaptation to military operations, but still more because it seals up the peninsula itself, so that no hostile force can obtain either ingress or egress without crossing it. Hence the possession of the northern plains is, in a military point of view, equivalent to the possession of the peninsula itself. The defence of the basin is facilitated by the curve which the Alps assume, and which enables a force centrally situated (as at Turin or Alessandria ; to defend several of the approaches with equal effect ; the Italians, in short, operate from the chord which sub tends the are formed by the Alps. The basin itself also abounds with defensive lines supplied by the broad and rapid streams which cross it between the Alps and the Po. The passes by which the Po can be gained across the high Alps have been noticed in previous chapters ; of these the St. Gothard and Bernardino are wholly in the hands of a neutral State, Switzerland, and the Brenner belongs to Austria. The St. Bernard, moreover, cannot be made available without a breach of Swiss neutrality. The weakest point in the Italian frontier is on the Adige, where Austria intrudes a wedge-shaped block into Italy, giving her the partial command of the Stelvio, Tonale, and Lake Idro passes into Lombardy on the ono side, and the Val Sugana and Schio passes into Venetia on the other. Lastly, the line of the Alps may be turned"], [305, "Chap. XIII. COAST-LINE, HARBOURS, ETC. 289 at the N.E. angle from Austria, and at the S.W. angle from France, where the Maritime Alps present tolerable facilities about the head of the Bormi'da. Most of the passes are guarded by forts in the high valleys, such as Viuadio and Demonte on the Stura, Fenestrelles on the Clusdne, Exilles on the Doria Riparia, Fort Bard (of which a sketch is given at the head of this chapter) on the Doria Baltea, and Rocca d'Anfo on Lake Idro. Many of the large towns are strongly fortified, and the positions of Alessandria on the Tanaro and Casale on the Po are highly important for the command of the upper basin, as Verona on the Adige and Mantua on the Mincio are for that of the lower basin. The most defensible lines on the plain are those which bound Lombardy E. and W. ; in the former direction, the double line ofthe Mincio and the Adige, with the famous Quadrilateral formed by the fortresses Peschie'ra and Mantua on the Mincio, Verona and Leg nago on the Adige ; and on the W. frontier, the Ticino, which, with the Trebbia on the other side of the Po and the intermediate section of the Po itself, forms a continuous line across the whole basin. Both of these lines have witnessed important battles, no less than three having been fought on the Trebbia, and a greater number on the ground W. of the Quadrdateral. The Adda and the Oglio supply inter mediate lines, which, with the Alps on the N. and the Po on the S., break up the whole of Lombardy into natural quadrilaterals. The numerous canals of this region are another feature of importance. \u00a7 2. Coast-line, Harbours. \u2014 Italy possesses an extended coast line of about 2000 m. on the Adriatic, the Ionian, and the Tyrrhenian seas ; but its value in a commercial point of view is prejudicially affected by two circumstances \u2014 the large amount of alluvial deposit brought down by many of the rivers, and the absence of tides of sufficient strength to clear away these deposits. The effects are (1) that the estuaries of the rivers are unavailable for harbourage ; (2) that the coast-line of the Adriatic is in a constant state of change, so that the old Boman ports (Eavenna, Adria, &c.) are now some miles inland ; and (3) that artificial ports, formed by moles, are more than usually liable to choke up, as has happened at Salerno, Brindisi, and other places. The harbourage is therefore deficient, particularly on the E. coast, which is low and regular ; on this side the most frequented ports are Venice, Anc6na, Gallipoli (which possesses an excellent roadstead), and Bari. On the S. coast Taranto has a magnificent roadstead. On the W. coast, which is more varied, there is excellent harbourage in several of the more enclosed bays, as Naples, Spezia, and Gadta, and good ports at Genoa, Leg horn, and Civita Vecchia. Bays, Promontories, $c. \u2014 The most noticeable objects on the E. coast are : \u2014 The Lagunes which fringe the coast between the mouth of the Isonzo and Ravenna ; the promontory formed by Monte Gargano ; the Gulf of Manfredonia S. of that promontory ; and the Strait of Otranto, which connects the Adriatic with the Mediterranean. The southern coast is washed by the Ionian Sea, and is high and varied ; the \" heel \" of Italy terminates in C. Lenca, W. of which the coast MOD. GEO. 0"], [306, "290 ITALY. Booi I. recedes inland and forms the spacious Gulf of Taranto, extending S. to the lofty C. Nau or Colonne, the latter name derived from the columns of the Temple of Juno formerly visible on it ; the Gulf of Squillace follows to the S., and the extreme southern stretch is bounded E. by C. Spartivento, and W. by C. dell' Armi. The Strait of Messina separates Italy from Sicily. The W. eoast is varied by a series of fine open bays, the chief of which from S. to N. are as follows :\u2014 the G. of St. Eufemia, terminated N. by C. Suvero ; the G. of Policastro, terminated N. by the water-worn chalk cliffs of C. Spartimento or Palinuro ; the G. of Salerno, between C. Licosa and Punta Campanella, the lofty point of the penin sula of Sorrento, which is prolonged in the isle of Capri ; the beautiful G. of Naples, on the other side of the Sorrentine peninsula, with the conspicuous promontory of Mist-no, pyramidal and well-wooded, for its other limit, and the . islands of Procida and Ischia answering to Capri ; the G. of Gaeta, a fine sweep of coast between Capes Miseno and Circello, divided into two portions by the point on which Gaeta stands; and, lastly, the extensive G. of Genoa, enclosed by the stretches of coast entitled Rivie'ra di Levante and R. di Ponente (i.e., the eastern and western shores respectively) which meet at Voltri, the former con taining the fine G. of Spezia and the Bay of Rapallo. \u00a7 3. Configuration \u2014 Mountains and Plains. \u2014 Italy falls into three great natural divisions:\u2014 (1) The great plain of Northern or Continental Italy ; (2) the long narrow peninsula of which the Apennines form the back -bone, and which is, in a restricted sense, Peninsular Italy; and (3) Sicily and Sardinia, with the adjacent islets, which form Insular Italy. The two first regions are sepa rated from each other by the sweep of the Apennines, the lower ridges of which almost reach the Adriatic near Bimini. The Great Plain is enclosed between the Alps and the Apennines, and slopes gently towards the Adriatic ; it is watered by the Po, the Adige, and various other streams, whose courses converge towards the Adriatic. It is divided into two unequal portions by the Euganean and Berician hills S. of Vicenza, the eastern being the smallest. For fertility and facility of intercommunication this plain is un rivalled in the world ; the swampy regions about the Adriatic are the least attractive part of it. Peninsular Italy is mainly occupied by the Apennines, which intersect it in the direction of its length, and in places occupy nearly the whole of its breadth, but elsewhere leave space for maritime plains of varying size, of which the most important are the Tuscan, the Boman, the Campanian, and the Apulian. The Apennines form an unbroken barrier between the two coasts down to the Gulfs of Eufemia and Squillace, where they so far subside that a canal might be easily carried across. Of these, as being in a special sense the range of Italy, a further description is needed. Tlie Apennines. \u2014 The Apennines fall into three divisions : \u2014 Northern, Central, and Southern, the Central occupying the section between the sources of the Tiber and the Voltorno. (1) The northern division"], [307, "Chap. XIII. MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS. 291 embraces the portions occasionally distinguished as the Ligurian and the Tuscan Apennines. Throughout this part there is a single crest ridge falling off steeply towards the Gulf of Genoa and sloping more gently on its northern side. The Tuscan Apennines yield the finest marble at Carrara, between the rivers Magra and Serchio. The loftiest point in the Northern Apennines is Monte Cimone (6973 ft.), N. of Pistdja. (2) The Central Apennines retain the crest range of the northern division as far as Monte Sibilla, a little S. of the 43rd parallel, but from this point they expand into an elevated highland, supported by parallel ranges and flajked on the W. by the Sub-Apennines of Tuscany between the Tiber and the Arno, and the Sub-Apennines of Rome between the Tiber and the Garigliano. The central highland, named the Plateau of Abruzzo, terminates S. in the lofty ranges that surround Lake Celano. The loftiest summits of the Apennines are found on the skirts of this plateau, viz., Monte Corno or Gran Sasso, which has been already noticed as the culminating point of the whole range, and the massive Majella (9133 ft.) on the E. side, respectively N. and S. of the Pescara ; Monte Velino (8183 ft.) on the W. side, N. of Lake Celano ; and Monte Meta (7840 ft.) at the S. extremity, near the Sangro. Lake Celano itself lies at an elevation of 2180 ft. The Sub-Apennine region of Tuscany surrounds the course of the upper and Middle Ombrdne, and is a generally elevated region with occa sional ranges rising out of it; between it and the sea is the low and unhealthy Maremma. Tlie Roman Sub-Apennines are more varied than the Tuscan, and contain the picturesque group of the Alban hills and the Sabine range ; a low plain, named the Campagna, again skirts the sea-coast. (3) The Southern Apennines are broken and irregular, but not so lofty as the central. They trend off towards the W. coast, leaving an extensive, but dry and bare plain along the coast of the Adriatic, and on the other side the smaller but more celebrated plain of Campania. More S. they follow the line of the Calabrian coast, and finally decline between the Gulfs of St. Eufemia and Squillace. The Sila range, in the peninsula N. of the latter gulf, is a distinct mass, separated from the Apennines by the valley of the Crati, and of different geological formation. The Aspromonte, which rises S. of the depression between the gulfs, may also be regarded as an independent range, and is remarkably wild and rugged. \u00a7 4. Eivers. \u2014 The rivers of Italy may be classified under the two heads of the rivers of the northern plain and the rivers of tho peninsula. The first class embraces the Po, the Adige, and the smaller rivers which seek the head of the Adriatic, either from the Alps or the Apennines ; the second comprises the numerous streams which pour down from the flanks of the Apennines towards each of the seas, and which for the most part have short and independent courses, yet in some cases attain additional length by having their upper and middle courses parallel to the Apennines, as is the case with the Tiber and the Garigliano. The Po rises on the side of Monte Viso. Its upper course terminates at the confluence of the Ticino and its middle course at the head of its delta. In its upper course the fall is very rapid, but when it reaches the plain the descent is slight, not exceeding 300 ft. between the o 2"], [308, "292 ITALY. Book I, Ticino and the sea. Hence its stream becomes slow, and its course tortuous ; inundations occur in the summer months, and so much alluvium is deposited in its bed that this has been raised in its lower course considerably above the level of the plain, which is only pro tected by artificial dams. The delta commences about 50 miles above its mouth ; the river originally flowed by Ferrara, and a channel still passes by that town, which, after receiving a portion of the Po and the waters of the Reno, divides into two branches distinguished by the names of the places where they reach the sea, viz., Volano and Primaro. The main body of the Po has, since 1152, flowed N. of Ferrara, and divides at Papozzo into 2 chief branches, the Po Grande and the Po d' Ariano, which again subdivide before reaching the sea. The Po is navigable for small merchant vessels to near Ferrara, and for barges to Cremona and generally to Casale. The chief affluents of the Po come from the Alps ; in its upper course it is joined 1. by the Doria Baltea from the Val d'Aosta and the Sesia from Monte Rosa, and rt. by the Tanaro, the only important affluent which joins it on that side, rising in the Maritime Alps and flowing nearly parallel to it. In its middle course the chief affluents are : \u2014 the Ticino, a deep rapid stream, which rises on St. Gothard, traverses the Lago Maggiore, and passes by Pavia; the Adda, a yet more important river, which, rising on the Ortler- Spitz, drains the Valteline, and traverses Lake Como ; the Oglio, which traverses Lake Iseo, and lower down intercepts the Melia and the Chie'se ; and, lastly, the Mincio, the outlet of the Lake Garda, and the representative of the Sarca, which feeds that lake. The other rivers of the plain are : the Adige, which rises in the Rh\u00e6tian Alps, enters the plain at Verona, and iu its lower course runs parallel to the Po, with which it is connected by canals ; the Bacchi glione and the Brenta, which have formed the Venetian Lagunes ; the Piave, the Livenza, and the Tagliamento, all of which have the same character \u2014 wide shallow beds, and low marshy outlets. Of the rivers of the peninsula, the Arno and the Tiber call for special notice. They rise in the same part of the Central Apennines, and flow at first in parallel valleys ; the Arno, however, diverges to the N.W. through a most picturesque valley of 14 m. in length to the confluence of the Sie've, whence it turns W. to the plain of Florence, and reaches the sea below Pisa ; it is liable to heavy floods. The Tiber has a tolerably direct southerly course of 150 m., during which it receives on its 1. bank the Topi'no, the Nera with the Veli'no, and the Teverone, famed for its fall at Tivoli ; and on its rt. bank the Chiana, which forms a connecting link with the Arno. After traversing Rome, the Tiber crosses the Campagna for 1 5 m. to the sea, which it enters by 2 arms, the Fiumara and the Fiumicfno, the former shallow and silted up, the latter navigable. The other rivers of the peninsula are, on the \"W. side of the Apennines, the Garigliano and the Volturno ; and on the E. Bide, the Ofanto and the Biferno. \u00a7 5. Lakes. \u2014 The lakes mentioned in the preceding section in connection with the rivers, occupy a belt at the point where the lower Alpine valleys open out into the plain. They have all the characteristics of mountain lakes, being long, narrow, and winding ; and they present the most magnificent scenery, heightened by the contrast between the savage and bare appearance of the mountains, and the luxuriant verdure of the banks of the lakes"], [309, "Chap. XIII. LAKES AND VOLCANOES. 293 themselves. The Lago Maggiore is the longest, but not the largest of the series ; it has a length of 40 m., and a maximum breadth of 8 m. ; it contains 4 small but beautiful islands, named the Borromean. lake Como has about the same length as Maggiore, but is narrower : it is divided at its lower end by the promontory of Bellaggio into two arms, named after the towns of Como and Lecco. Between Como and Maggiore is the smaller lake of Lugano, im bedded amid lofty mountains, and discharging its surplus waters by the Tresa into L. Maggiore. The Lago di Garda has the largest area of any of the lakes, being 32 m. long, and expanding towards the S. to a maximum breadth of 13 m. ; the classical promontory of Sermione is on its S. shore ; the lake is famed for the wonder fully deep blue hue of its waters. The lakes of Peninsular Italy have a very different character : they are generally small and circular, and frequently occupy the craters of extinct volcanoes. This is the case undoubtedly with the beautiful lakes of Albano and Nemi near Rome, both of which are provided with emissaries in order to prevent the overflow of their waters, that of the Albano Lake 1509 yds. long, and that of Nemi 1649 yds., both of great antiquity : it is also apparently the case with the lakes of Bolsena and Bracci\u00a3no, though their size, 26i m. and 20 m. in circumference respectively, makes this doubtful. The Lake of Perugia, the largest in the peninsula (30 m. round), opens on to a plain on the W., and is relieved of its surplus waters by an emissary dating from the 15th cent. The Lago Celano, high up amid the Central Apennines, was formerly the largest ; but a considerable portion of it has been drained by a restoration of the emissary constructed by the Emperor Claudius. Averno, near Naples, is a well-known instance of a crater-lake. \u00a7 6. Volcanic Action. \u2014 Volcanic action displays itself in various ways on the shores of the Bay of Naples. Vesuvius, the only active volcano in continental Europe, is a conspicuous object from all parts of the bay; a description of it is subjoined. The Solfatara, near Pozzuoli, is partially active : only one eruption is recorded, viz., in 1198, when a stream of lava poured forth to the sea; the signs of activity are now confined to discharges of sulphuretted hydrogen gas which escape through fissures in the roof of the crater, with occa sional volumes of smoke and rumbling noises. Monte Nuovo, close to Lake Averno, has not been active since the time it was thrown up in 1538 : its crater is 419 ft. deep, only 21 ft. less than the height of the cone. Monte Epomeo in Ischia has been dormant since 1302, previous to which eruptions were freouent : it has 12 cones on its sides and about its base. The level of the coast is subject to changes, a remarkable proof of which is furnished by the ruined temple of Serapis at Pozzuoli, which has been submerged some 20 ft. below"], [310, "Book I, 294 ITALY. the sea and again elevated, and is now again sinking. We may further notice the vapours rising from Lakes Averno and Agnino, and in the Grotta del Cane, near Agnano, a cave in which carbonic acid gas exudes in such amount as to form a layer 2 ft. thick on the floor. Vesuvius. \u2014 This celebrated volcano stands opposite the centre of the Bay of Naples, and consists of a comparatively modern cone projected out of an ancient crater. Of the ancient crater, a portion still exists on the N. and E. sides of the cone : it is called Monte Somma, and attains a height of 3747 ft. ; the portion on the W. and S. of the cone has been destroyed by eruptions, but its position is marked on the S. by the ridge of La Pedamentina. A deep valley called the Atrio del Cavallo separates Monte Somma from the cone. The height of the cone varies, and has reached to 4079 ft. The earliest eruption in historical times happened a.d. 79, when Pompeii and Herculaneum were overwhelmed, and the elder Pliny perished ; no lava flowed, but there were showers of ashes, stones, and volcanic substances, mingled with vast jets of steam, which together formed a penetrating liquid mud. The other most famous eruptions occurred at the following dates ; \u2014 512, when lava is supposed to have first issued ; 1631, when 7 streams of lava poured out, and 18,000 souls perished ; 1707, when Naples was completely darkened by the ashes ; 1779, when a column of fire shot up to 3 times the height of the mountain itself; 1793-4, when the side of the mountain opened at various points, and poured out a vast stream of lava which entered the sea at Torre del Greco, \\?ith a breadth of 1204 ft. and a depth of 15 ft. ; and 1855, when Portici was threatened. \u00a7 7. Climate. \u2014 The temperature of Italy varies more in respect to the cold of winter than the heat of summer. The northern plain has a more continental climate than the peninsula, being affected both by its remoteness from the sea and by the barrier of lofty mountains on 3 of its sides. The summer heat of Milan nearly equals that of Naples, and Bologna is reputed the hottest town in Italy ; but the winter cold of Milan exceeds that of Naples by 10\u00b0, and the mean temperature of the year at the two places stands at about 55\u00b0 at Milan and 61\u00b0 at Naples. In the N. the rainfall is considerable, attaining to an annual average of 100 inches at Tol mezzo, N.W. of Udine : fogs prevail in the autumn, snow falls in the winter, and canals are not unfrequently frozen over. On the plains of peninsular Italy snow is uncommon, and does not lie above 24 hours ; and frosts are not continuous. To the S. of Naples frosts are unknown : the fig, orange, citron, lemon, and almond flourish in the open air, and on the S. coast the date-palm produces, though it does not ripen, its fruit. The chief drawbacks to the climate of the peninsular region are (1) the prevalence of a dry searching wind, called the tramontana, which blows down from the Apennines in the winter months, and is dangerous to the health ; and (2) the occasional visits of the African sirocco from the S., which is rather"], [311, "Chap. XIII. CLIMATE, PRODUCTIONS, ETC. 295 enervating than prejudicial. The maritime plains and the borders of several of the southern lakes are haunted in the autumn by the deadly fever called the malaria, arising from marshy exhalations at night, and becoming more r.fe as the population diminishes. The amount of rainfall is somewhat deficient in the peninsula ; in June, July, and August, hardly any falls. The transparent atmosphere and generally unclouded sky of Southern Italy are a great charm to the eye of a North-European. \u00a7 8. Soil and Productions. Agriculture. \u2014 About two-fifths of the soil of Italy are under cultivation ; the remainder is chiefly mountain-top, available only for summer pasturage. The soil is fertile wherever irrigation is possible, and on the plains of Lombardy where a scientific system of irrigation prevails, the productiveness is maintained throughout the year ; but in the S. the plains parch up, and become quite bare in summer. Timber is abundant, and the chestnut is important as supplying an article of ordinary diet. Bice is extensively grown in Piedmont, Lombardy, and the S.E. Adriatic provinces. Maize is more general than wheat ; the other cereals are grown on the higher grounds. Cotton is produced in the swampy parts of Otranto and Bari, and tobacco also In Otranto and in the Papal States. The management of the silkworm, and the cultivation of the vine and the olive are important objects. Among the special products we may notice liquorice and manna, both of which belong to Calabria. The mineral resources consist mainly of marble, salt, and volcanic products, such as sulphur, alum, boracic acid, and lava ; coal (lignite) is found in Tuscany and Lombardy ; of metals, the most valuable are the iron of Elba and the copper of Tuscany. The Piedmontese Alps yield copper, lead, and iron, and mines are at work in the higher valleys of the Doria and the Sesia. Mineral springs are very numerous ; the baths at Lucca, Casciano, and Ischia are visited by invalids. The surrounding seas afford valuable fisheries of the tunny, the sword-fish, and the anchovy. Agriculture. \u2014 Pastoral pursuits hold a prominent place in Italy, and the juxta-position of high mountains and low plains, with their different conditions of temperature and vegetation, induces a system of migra \u25a0 lion throughout the whole country, but more especially in the central and southern portions. The Roman Campagna, for instance, is covered with animals in the winter, but as the summer heats parch up the plain and malaria becomes rife, the herdsmen withdraw to the Sub- Apennine or even the Central Apennine pastures, and return again in the winter. This process has been reduced to a system, known as the Tavoliere, on the eastern side of the peninsula, where the plains of Puglia offer luxuriant herbage in the winter to the flocks and herds of the farmers of the Central Apennines, who pay a tax to the government for tire pasturage. The methods of agriculture in Italy are somewhat antiquated : in many parts the land is farmed on the metayer system, uuder which the landlord supplies the stock and the tenant his labour,"], [312, "Book I, 296 ITALY, the profits being divided between them. The agricultural product with which we are most familiar is the Parmesan cheese, produced in the irrigated districts between Milan, Lodi, and Pavia. Silk. The production of silk spreads extensively throughout Italy, and the mulberry is supplanting the olive in many districts. In Lombardy the mulberry-trees line the roads and the fields ; they are generally pollarded, and so kept low and thick. The annual value of the silk crop exceeds ten million sterling. Vine and Olive. \u2014 The vine flourishes universally, but the wines of Italy cannot compete with those of France or Spain. Tuscany is the district where most attention is paid to the manufacture. The wine called Lacryma Christi, imported into England, is produced on the slopes of Vesuvius. The olive flourishes more especially in Tuscany (Lucca oil beiug of the first quality), about Naples (the Sergia oil of Venafro), and in the Adriatic provinces of Bari and Otranto. \u00a7 9. Inhabitants, Government, Beligion, and Education. Manufactures, Commerce, Communications. \u2014 Italy is occupied by a remarkably homogeneous people. With the exception of a few colonies of Germans ' in the N., and a sprinkling of Greeks and Albanians on the Apulian peninsula, all are Italians \u2014 a mingled race of Latins, Ostrogoths, Longobards, and Normans, but speaking one tongue, and, with very few exceptions, professing one religion. The differences of dialect and character in the various districts are indeed very strongly marked ; the Piedmontese dialect, for instance, is an intermediate link between the Italian and the Provencal ; the Bolognese dialect is also coarse and rough to a degree ; both would be unintelligible to a Neapolitan. Tuscany is the home of classical Italian, but the Boman pronunciation is deemed the purest. The prominent traits in the Italian character are excitability of temper and manner, frugality and simplicity of life, love of ease and plea sure, and an inborn capacity for appreciating the beautiful in every department of art, which has rendered their country the chief school for sculpture, painting, and music. Government. \u2014 The whole of Italy, with the exception of the Papal States and San Marino, is combined under a single sovereign, and par ticipates in the benefits of representative institutions. The executive is vested in the king, who acts through responsible ministers. The legislative power is shared between him and the Parliament, consisting of a house of senators nominated by him, and a house of deputies elected by the nation at large. The several provinces are governed by prefects, and the number of officials employed in the administration of affairs involves a great expense. Brigandage is still rife in the southern part of the kingdom. In the Papal States the Pope is auto cratic. San Marino is a republic. 1 These colonies are interesting iu an historical point of view as being probably rem nants of ihe early German migrations. The existing German communities are the Sttte Communi about Asiago in Venetia. the Tredeci Communi near Verona, and the occupants ol some ofthe high valleys running up to Monte Kosa, as Anzasca, Sesia, Tournanche, and Alacugnaga."], [313, "Chap. XIII. GOVERNMENT, TRADE, ETC. 297 Religion and Education. \u2014 The Roman Catholic religion prevails almost exclusively, but toleration is extended to other religious bodies, and among others to the Vaudois or Waldenses, whose head quarters are in the Alpine Val Pellice, S.W. of Turin. The political influence of the church has been much diminished of late by the secularization of its estates, and by the claim of the king to confirm the appointment of bishops. Primary education is advancing, but is still very inadequate ; hardly more than one person in six can read and write ; Piedmont is the best educated district. The higher education is carried on in the following universities, the dates of the foundation being appended in brackets:\u2014 Bologna (11 19), Padua (1221), Naples (1224 j, Rome (1244), Perugia (1320), Pisa (1329), Siena (1349), Pavia (1390, that being the date of its enlargement by Galeazzo), Turin (1412), Parma (1422), Florence (1443), and Genoa (1783), and on a smaller scale at Camerino, Fermo, Modena, Macerata, and Ferrara. Manufactures. \u2014 The manufactures of Italy are chiefly of a light and elegant character. A certain amount of silk aud velvet is made, the latter particularly at Genoa, and woollen textures are produced for home supply and for export to the Levant ; but the articles best known to the outer world are of an artistic character, such as ornamental glass (Venice), filigree work (Genoa aud Naples), coral ornaments (Naples), perfumery, straw-plaiting (Leghorn aud other Tuscan towns), paper, gloves, &c. Macaroni is made on a large scale at Amalfi, Torre dell' Annunziata, and Gragnano. Commerce, \u2014 The foreign commerce of Italy is on a restricted scale \u2022 the chief import is cotton goods from England ; the chief export, silk, raw and manufactured. The other exports are olive-oil, brimstone, liquorice, aud the fancy articles above enumerated ; and the other imports, iron and hardware, salt fish, and corn. Communications. \u2014 The most important line of railway in Italy is that which takes up the Mont Cenis route at Susa, and, traversing the basin of the Po to Bologna, strikes the Adriatic coast at Rimini, which it thence follows closely to Brindisi aud the \"heel\" of Italy. This line supplies the shortest route betwsen Paris and Alexandria, and is hence adapted to carry our East Indian mails. An equally im portant line for the internal commerce of Italy is that which enters from Austria at Udine, and which will shortly be completed to Rome and Naples, by way of Padua, Ferrara, Bologna, and Florence. From Rome a line crosses the Apennines to Folcanara, near Ancona ; this is joined at Foligno, S.E. of Perugia, by a line from Florence, which forms at present the means of communication between that city and Rome* hut a more direct line by way of Orvieto and the valley of the Chiana is iu progress. The great towns of North Italy are linked together by a line between Turin and Venice, passing through Milan, Brescia, and Verona. Canals are numerous in Lombardy, but are more important for irrigation than for traffic ; we may mention the Naviglio Grande between Milan and the Ticino, probably the oldest canal in Europe ; and the Naviglio di Pavia bet ween Milan and Pavia. \u00a310. Political Divisions. \u2014 In the organization of the present kingdom of Italy the old monarchies have been superseded by a division into provinces of moderate size named after the chief towns. The number of these amounts to 68, including 7 for Sicily, 2 for Sardinia, and 9 for Venetia. In the present work, however, we o 3"], [314, "Book I, 298 ITALY, shall retain the old historical arrangement, which serves to mark ti a certain extent the past condition of Italy, using the term Emilia \" as co-extensive with the duchies of Parma and Modena, though it is sometimes extended over the Romagna as well. The geo graphical distribution of these divisions is as follows: \u2014 (1) In Northern Italy \u2014 Lombardy, between the Ticino, the Mincio, the Po, and the Alps ; Venetia to the E., and Piedmont to the W. of Lombardy, the latter reaching S. to the Apennines, between which and the sea is the maritime district of Genoa ; Emilia and Romagna, S. of the Po, between Piedmont and the Adriatic. (2) In Central Italy \u2014 Tuscany, between the Apennines and the Tyrrhenian Sea; the Papal States, S. of Tuscany, in the mid and lower basin of the Tiber; Umbria and the Marches, formerly the Papal States, Umbria in the upper basin of the Tiber about Perugia, the Marches between the Apennines and the Adriatic. (3) In Southern Italy the Neapolitan States, including all that lies S. of the Tronto on the E. coast, and of Terracina on the W., and formerly divided into 15 provinces, arranged as follows : \u2014 the 3 Abruzzi in the N.E. ; the 3 Calabrias in the S. ; Lavdro, Naples, and the 2 Prin cipari in the W. ; Molise, Capitanata, Bari, and Otranto on the E. coast ; and Basilicata on the Gulf of Taranto. Many of the above names rei. resent historical epochs : Romagna, the period when Ravenna was regarded as the capital of the western Roman empire ; Lombardy, the entrance of the Longobards and their inde pendent kingdom (568-774) ; the Marches, also the period ofthe Lom bards, who governed this part of Italy by a marchio or marquis ; Capitanata, the supremacy of the Greek emperors in S. Italy, between 890 and 1041, during which they governed it by an officer named Catapan ; Basilicata, probably referring to the same period (! Basd or basileus \" king\") ; and Principato, the principality of Salerno, held by Lombard princes until the time of the Norman conquest somewhere about 1060. \u00a7 11. Towns. \u2014 The towns of Italy are peculiarly rich both in monuments of art and in historical associations; and frequently these sources of interest are enhanced by the charms of position and scenery. At present Italy may be said to have two capitals, Borne and Florence \u2014 the first, the metropolis of Catholicism throughout the world, and the focus in which all associations of imperial great ness centre ; the second, the adopted seat of government for the kingdom of Italy. Both are rich in art-treasures, and Florence is fairly styled the \"Beautiful\" in reference to its picturesque scenery. In point of population, neither of the above can com pete with Naples, the capital of South Italy, which numbers - The name ' Emilia' is borrowed from the \u00c6milia Via which traversed this part of Italy"], [315, "Chap. XIII. TOWNS. 299 above 400,000 inhabitants, and challenges the world to rival its magnificent position (\" See Naples and die \"). Turin, the capital of Piedmont, equals Borne in population, but is shorn of its glory by the removal (in 1865) of the seat of government to Florence ; it will henceforth depend on its provincial importance. Milan, \" the Grand,\" has nearly 200,000 inhabitants, and is the commercial and intellectual centre of the rich district of Lombardy, of which it may be regarded as the capital. Genoa and Venice are the great ports of Northern Italy: Genoa for traffic with France and the West, Venice for the Adriatic and the Levant. Genoa, \"the Superb,\" is remarkable for its noble appearance as viewed from the sea, rising tier above tier on an amphitheatre of hills, and having Rome. a splendid group of palaces at the back of the town ; it is a bustling and thriving place. Venice is a great contrast in all respects : built on piles, surrounded by lagunes, intersected by canals which form its still highways, abounding with elegant buildings, hut fallen from its ancient fame, and no more entitled to the epithet of \" la Domi nante \" or \" mistress \" of the seas. Bologna is the only other city with a population of 100,000 ; it is surrounded by a fertile country, and is the seat of a flourishing university (formerly celebrated for the study of law, now of medicine), and of various art institutions. We may further notice Leghorn, the port of Tuscany ; Verona, on the Adige, an important fortress and railway centre ; Padua, with a still flourishing university; Parma ami Modena, former capitals"], [316, "300 ITALY, Book I, of their respective duchies ; Brescia, Cremona, Pavia \" the learned,\" with a university, and Bergamo in Lombardy ; Vicenza, Mantua, and TJdine, in Venetia ; the port of Ancona, in the Marches ; Pisa and Lucca \" the industrious,\" in Tuscany ; all of them possessing specific features of interest. In the south of Italy a large proportion of the population is gathered into towns, partly for protection and partly from the character of the country : but, for the most part, these towns are deficient in interest. We may except those which were of importance in the middle ages, as Amalfi, Benevento, Capua, Salerno, and Melfi. The towns on the Bay of Naples are beautifully situated, particularly Sorrento, which, as well as Castellamare, enjoys a cooler climate than Naples itself. On the other side of the penin sula Foggia, the capital of the Tavoliere, and the seaport towns of Barletta, Trani, Molfetta, Bari, and Taranto, are populous places; Aquila has a local importance as the chief town in the central region, while Cerignola, Andria, Corato, Terlizzi, and Bitonto are inland towns on the plain of Apulia, and Lecce is centrally situated in the \" heel \" of Italy. The Calabrian towns, Reggio, Catanziro, and others, suffered frightfully from the earthquake of 1783. Northern Italt.

Its Physical Features. \u2014 The large island of Sicily is separated from Italy by the Strait of Messina, which gradu- ally expands from a minimum breadth of 6047 yds. (nearly 3} m.) between the Castle of Scilla and the Faro point at its N. entrance, to 10 or 12 m. in the S. The passage across it is effected between Reggio and Messina, distant 7i m. The island has the form of an isosceles triangle, of which the apex points W., and the base faces the Ionian Sea; the promontories at the 3 angles being C. Faro,N.E., C. Passaro, S.E., and C. Boeo, W. It is composed of a framework of mountains and highlands, surrounded by maritime plains of varying size. The dorsal range runs parallel to the N. coast, and is known in its E. division as the Pelorio range, and in its W. division to the source of the Belice as the Madonian range. The loftiest point of the latter range is the Pizzo de Case, exceeding 6000 ft., at its E. extremity near Polizzi, whence a lateral range strikes off S.E. to C. Passaro, under the name of Monti Sori. E. of this ran^e is the fine Plain of Catania, which would have been still larger if \u00b0the volcanic"], [323, "CllAP. XIII.

The rivers of Sicily are insignificant ; the chbf are the Giaretta, which traverses the plain of Catania, the Sals), which reaches the S. coast near Alicata, and the Belioi farther W.

Its sides are divided into 3 regions: \u2014 (1) The lower region, which is remarkably fertile with its lava soil, aud covered with fields and vineyards, towns and villages. (2) The woody region which occupies the central part between 3400 ft. and 6300 ft., occupied by forests of oak, beech, pine, and chestnut. (3) The desert region thence to the summit. The chief crater is thrice as large as that of Vesuvius, and iu addition to this there are about 80 cones of consider able size and several hundred small ones. The most famous eruptions occurred in 1669, when Monti Rossi, a cone 450 ft. high, was thrown up near Nicolosi, and a vast lava stream poured through Catania ; in 1792, when several new mouths opened and lava flowed for 12 months ; and in 1832, when Bronte was threatened with destruction. \u00a7 13. Climate and Productions. Political Divisions, Towns, &c. \u2014 The climate of Sicily is fine, but verges to excessive heat. The interior is for the most part bare and deserted ; the forests have long since been extirpated, and the streams have consequently dried up. The maritime plains are fertile to a degree, particularly those of Catania and Palermo (the latter of which is called the eonca d'oro or \" golden shell \") ; they produce wheat and maize, fruit of various kinds (including oranges, lemons, almonds), the vine, the olive, and some cotton and sugar. But agriculture, like everything else in Sicily, is at its lowest ebb. Sulphur is the chief mineral product. A certain amount of silk is produced on the E. coast, and Marsala wine is largely exported to England from the W. Roads are un known in the interior : a railroad has been opened between Palermo and Termini. The island is divided into 7 provinces, named after their respective capitals\u2014 Palermo, Messina, Catania, Girgenti, Noto, Trapani, and Caltanisetta. The towns are very numerous on the N. and E. coasts. Palermo ranks as the capital : it is beautifully situated on the N. coast under Monte Pellegrino, and contains some spacious and regular streets ; it is the seat of a university. Catania, on the E. coast, is also the seat of a university founded in 1445, and is regarded as the most enlightened town in Sicily ; much of it is built of lava, and the streets are regular and spacious, having been rebuilt since the earthquake of 1693. Messina, the third town in population, has a splendid harbour, and is the ordinary place of transit to the mainland. Marsala is well known to us as the seat of the wine trade. Siragdsa, the representative of the ancient Syracuse, is a decayed place with its harbour silted up.

Isles. \u2014 Adjacent to Sicily are the two groups of (1) the Lipari Islands, about 20 m. distant from tbe N. coast, of volcanic origin, con sisting of 7 larger and many smaller islands, rich in wine, figs, and cotton, Stromboli and Volcano having still active craters ; and (2) the \u00c6gadic Islands, off the W. point, 3 in number, of which Favignana is the chief. We may further notice the isolated islands of TJstica, N.W. ofthe Lipari ; Pantellaria, between Sicily and C. Bon, volcanic, and used hy the Italians as a penal settlement; Iinosa and Lampedusa, between Malta and the coast of Tunis. \u00a7 14. Sardinia.\u2014 Sardinia is distant from the coast of Italy about 140 m., from Africa 110 m., and from Corsica 9 m., the Strait of Boni facio intervening. It has a length of 170 m., a breadth of 70 m.,"], [325, "Chap. XIII. SARDINIA. 309 an area of 9363 sq. m., and a population of 588,064. The island is mountainous : a nearly continuous chain runs from N. to S. on the E. side of the island, attaining its greatest height (5276 ft.) in Genargentu, near the centre. On the W. side the mountains are lower and more broken ; a series of highlands between the rivers Tirso and Goceano connect these with the main chain. Extensive plains surround some of the rivers, the Campidano about the ulla in the S., and the Campo d'Ozieri about the Coquinas in the N. The chief rivers are the Tirso in the W., the Flumendosa in the S.E., and the two rivers above mentioned in the N. and S. The climate is hot, and the plains are malarious. Forests occupy two fifths of the surface. The soil is fertile, and the vine, olive, and orange attain perfection. The system of agriculture, however, is antiquated, and the resources of the island are undeveloped. The capital Cagliari, in the S., possesses a first-rate harbour, and is the seat of a university. Sassari, in the N., is about 9 m. from the sea, and is also the seat of a university. These two towns are the capitals of the two provinces into which the island is divided. Their popula tion are, Cagliari 28,244 ; Sassari 22,945. \u00a7 15. Malta. \u2014 The Maltese group lies S.W. of Sicily, 60 m. from C. Passaro, and about 180 m. from the coast of Africa. Malta itself is the most southerly of the group, which further includes Comino and Gozo, all subject to the British crown. Malta is 18 m. long, and has a maximum width of 10 m., an area of 98 sq. m., and a popula tion of 134,055, of whom 1274 are British. It is a calcareous rock, rising to a height of 590 ft., and terminating S. in precipitous cliffs. Much of the surface is bare rock, and the soil which covers the remainder has been for the most part carried there, and is kept in its place by terrace walls. Rain is rare, but heavy dews occur. The summer heat is excessive; at other periods the climate is delightful. Cotton and fruit are the most valuable products of the island ; the orange, olive, and fig, attain to great perfection. The only article of manufacture is jewellery of the filigree order. The inhabitants are a mixed race of Arabs, Greeks, and Italians ; they speak a peculiar language, having an Arabic basis, but with a large admixture of foreign words. Roman Catholicism is dominant. The government is under the military authorities. The island is extremely valuable to Great Britain as a commercial and naval station, giving her an independent position in the very heart of the Mediterranean. There is a splendid harbour, or rather double harbour, at Valletta, on the E. side of the island, guarded by im pregnable forts ; the town itself is situated on the elevated ridge or \" Hog's Back \" between the harbours, and contains some interesting architectural memorials of the former lords of the island, the Knights of St. John, who held it from 1530 to 1798."], [326, "< no ) Ts\u0153jJu; as TLeests- PHAPTEfi SIT.

It is divided by the Gulf of Corinth into two portions, Northern or Mainland Greece, and the Morea or Peninsular Greece, which are united by the Isthmus of Corinth (4 m. broad) between the Corinthian and Athenian Gulfs, (2) Insular Greece consists ol the following islands or groups of islands: \u2014 Eub\u0153a or Negropont, a large island closely adjacent to Northern Greece, and virtually a portion of it, inasmuch as it is connected with it by a bridge ; the Ionian Islands, an important group in the Ionian Sea, extending beyond the limits of Continental Greece to nearly 40\u00b0 N. lat. in one direction, and to about 36\u00b0 N. lat. in the other, and containing the 5 larger islands of Corfu, Leucadia, Cephalonia, Zante, and Cerigo ; tho Cyclades, a numerous group in the Archipelago, of which Naxia, Andro, and Tino are the largest ; the Northern Sporades, off the N. coast of Eub\u0153a, attached to Northern Greece ; and the Western Sporades, off tho coast of Attica and Argolis, attached partly to Northern Greece and partly to the Morea. The total area of the kingdom is 20,152 sq. m., to which the Cyclades contribute 1060, and the Ionian islands 1006 ; and the total population is 1,325,340, to which the two groups contribute respectively 118,130 and 228,530. Historical Geography. \u2014 The independence of modern Greece dates from 1829, previously to which it had been in the possession of the Turks with little interruption since the 15th century. The Ionian Islands are the only addition -the kingdom has received since its formation\u2014 these were united to it in 1863. The monarchical form of government was substituted for the republican in 1832. Geographical Names. \u2014 The classical names of ancient Greece are now in general use for all places of note. The names \"Euboea\" and \"Leucadia,\" for instance, have superseded \" Negropont \" and \" Santa Maura;\" \"Parnassus\" is more usual than \"Liakura,\" and the pro vinces are officially called by their ancient names. Corfu, however, holds its place, and is derived from the twin peaks (Kopvipui) on which tlie medi\u00e6val fortress was placed ; Cerigo is noteworthy as the only Slavonian name for a Greek island ; and Santorin ( = Saint Irene) is of a post-classical age. Some of the classical names are disguised by the addition of the preposition and article \u2014 thus Nio = iv 'Im, Stancho = is rkv Ka;, and Stalimene = is rav Ar/nvov. The origin of Negropont has been noticed in Ancient Geography, p. 422. \u00a7 2. Continental Greece \u2014 its Physical Conformation, Coast-line, Mountains, Rivers and Lakes, Climate and Pro ductions. \u2014 In its general aspect Greece presents all the characteristic features of the continent of Europe \u2014 extended coast-line, deeply penetrating gulfs, varied surface, and numerous rivers. From the smallness of the area in which these features are exhibited the country is broken up into small compartments separated from each other by natural barriers. This, which was a source of protection and strength to the numerous small states of ancient times, exercises"], [328, "312 GREECE. Book I. a prejudicial influence on the single state of the present day, inas much as it checks intercommunication and retards the advance of civilization and good government. The structure of Northern Greece differs materially from that of the Morea : the former is intersected by diverging lines of mountains enclosing valleys and river-basins ; the Morea consists of a central highland or mountain heart, surrounded by a maritime lowland. Coast-line, Harbours, &c. \u2014 The most prominent feature in the coast- line of Greece is the arm of the sea which separates Northern Greece from the Morea. It consists of an outer and an iuner basin, the outei one named the G. of Patras, and communicating westward with the Ionian Sea, the inner one the G. of Corinth or Lepanto, an elongated arm, 75 m. long, connected with the outer basin by a strait, sometimes called the \" Little Dardanelles,\" which is narrowed to a mile's breadth between the points occupied by the old forts of Roumelia and Morea. The outer basin contains the chief commercial port of Greece, Patras, with a good roadstead, but an exposed harbour ; the inner basin contains a more protected but less capacious harbour at Vostitza on the S. coast, and a small port at Lntraki, on the Isthmus of Corinth, which communicates with Kalamaki on the opposite side of the isthmus ; the N. coast contaius fine but unfrequented harbours. The W. coast of Greece has a wide open bay, the G. of Arkadhia, about the centre of the Morea ; the only good harbour on this coast is the spacious and deep basin at Navarino. The S. coast is deeply indented by the two Gulfs of Kalamata and Kolokythia, or, as they are otherwise named, Eoroni and Marathonisi, between which is the sharp-pointed peninsula terminating in C. Matapan, with Capes Gallo and Malia as the corres- ponding points on the other sides of the \"VV. and E. bays. These deep indentations and tapering peninsulas communicate to the Morea the resemblance to a vine-leaf noticed by the ancients. There are road- steads at Modon aud Eoroni on the western peninsula, the former well protected by the isle of Sapieuza, the latter exposed. The E. coast of Greece is more broken than the W. ; the G. of Athens (the old Saronic Gulf) intrudes between the peninsulas of Attica and Argolis, in the direction of the G. of Corinth ; Argolis is bounded on its other side by the G. of Nauplia, and Attica by the G. of Petali, which intervenes between it and Eub\u0153a. Attica terminates in C. Colonna (Sunium), so named from the ruins with which it is crowned. The narrow seas between Eub\u0153a and the mainland are the Euripo Channel, which leads up to the Euripus or Strait of Negropont from the S. ; the Talanta Channel, which leads up to the Euripus from the N. ; and the Trikeri Channel, which washes the N. coast. The Euripus itself is only lOOst. broad, and is spanned by a bridge, to which a rock, 35 ft. from the Eub\u0153an coast, supplies a natural pier. We have yet to notice the G. of Zeitun, which penetrates into the mainland from the point where the Talanta and Trikeri channels meet off the N.W. angle of Eub\u0153a. The best port on the E. coast of the Morea is Nauplia, which possesses one of the safest roadsteads in Greece, deep, sheltered, and well protected by military works ; the frequented port of Hydra and the government dockyard at Poro are on islands near the coast. Ealamaki, on the Isthmus of Corinth, serves as the port of transit for passengers between Athens and the West. Pir\u00e6us, the port of Athens, is safe and deep, and is once more a place of commerce."], [329, "Chap. XIV. MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, ETC. 313 Mountains. \u2014 The range of Pindus, which forms the backbone of the Greek peninsula, loses its distinctive form and name on the N. frontier of modern Greece, and breaks up into a series of divergent ranges. It first divides at the head of the river Sperchius, or Elladha, into two branches \u2014 Othrys, which goes E. to the G. of Volo, and Tymphrestus ( Velukhi), which continues the original direction of Pindus and connects with \u0152ta (Katavothra). At the head of the Cephissus another bifur cation takes place into a well-defined range which bounds the basin of that river on the N.E., and a line of detached heights on the S.W. ; the former retains the name of \u0152ta, and diverges E. to the shores of the Euripus, while the latter contains the culminating heights of Guiona (8239 ft.) at the S. extremity of the ancient Corax, and Parnassus (Liakoura, 8068 ft.), and may be traced through Helicon (Zagora), Cith\u00e6ron (Elated), and Hymettus, to the S.E. point of Attica. Westward of Parnassus irregular ranges ramify over Phocis and \u00c6tolia. In the Morea the N. barrier of the central highland is the loftiest, the highest point being Cyllene or Zyria (7788 ft.), at the E. angle. The only decisive break in the circuit that bounds the central highland is on the W. side, where the river Rufia or Alpheus makes its escape to the sea ; the ranges on the W. and S. are not so continuous or so clearly defined as on the N. and E. The E. barrier is continued beyond the limits of the central highland to the S. in tbe de tached heights of Parnon, the loftiest of which, Malevo, rises to 6355 ft. Facing this on the opposite side of the basin of the Iri or Eurotas rises the grand and massive range of Taygetus, whose culminating point, St. Elias (7902 ft.), is the loftiest in the Morea ; near Sparta the range is named Pentedactylon, from the five \" fingers \" or peaks, so con spicuously seen from the plain. Rivers and Lakes. \u2014 The rivers of Greece are for the most part short and of small volume, and in no case are they navigable. The destruc tion of the forests has produced a general desiccation, which has diminished the water-supply in modern times. The largest river in Northern Greece is the Achelous or Aspropotamo, which rises on Pindus and joins the Ionian Sea ; it owes its modern name to the white colour of its waters, resulting from the mud held in suspension, and by the deposits of which a considerable delta has been formed at its mouth. The only other river of importance is the Cephissus, which traverses the broad plain of B\u0153otia and discharges its waters into Lake Topolias. In the Morea the Rufia drains the central highland and reaches the plain of Elis through the defile of Lavdha; the Eurotas, or Iri, is the only river of note on the S. coast : it drains the plain between Parnon and Taygetus. Lakes are numerous: the most notice able of them is Topolias (the ancient Copais), which receives the Cephissus and other streams, and discharges its surplus waters into the Talanta Channel through four katabothra or subterranean channels ; the lake is little more than a Bwamp, and admits of being entirely drained. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The chmate of continental Greece is, generally speaking, fine and temperate. Great varieties of temperature are experienced at different elevations, and in the spring a person may in a few hours pass from summer heat on the coast of Morea to snow and winter cold on the central highlands. On the maritime plains the mean annual temperature is about 62\u00b0 ; snow occasionally falls, but does not lie, and winter does not last beyond February. In summer the heat is somewhat excessive. Storms are frequent ; but generally mod. GEO. P"], [330, "Book I. 314 GREECE. Greece rejoices in a brilliant sun and a transparent atmosphere. Ma laria infests the low coasts and marshy spots. Some fine forests yet remain on the mountains of Northern Greece, in Eub\u0153a, and in the western provinces of Peloponnesus. About one-tenth of the soil ot Greece is cultivated, and that badly. Corn is grown on the plains, and occasionally rice, cotton, and tobacco. The currant-grape is largely cultivated on the N. coast of the Morea, and the olive, vine, and fig flourish in the maritime districts. \u00a7 3. Insular Greece \u2014 the Position, Component Parts, Cli mate and Productions op the Island Groups. \u2014 The importance of the Insular as compared with the Continental portion of Greece appears from the following circumstances : \u2014 (1) that it contains a third of the whole population (454,391 out of 1,325,340) ; (2) that it contains, next to Athens, the three \u2014 or if Patras were absent, the five \u2014 most populous towns in the kingdom, viz. : \u2014 Corfu, Zante, Hermopolis or Syra, Spezzia, and Hydra ; (3) that the places just mentioned, and particularly Syra, are actively engaged in commerce ; and (4) that the special productions of Greece \u2014 currants, wine, and oil \u2014 attain their perfection on the islands. Of the groups mentioned in \u00a7 I., the Ionian islands merit precedence from their superior value. (1) The Ionian Islands. \u2014 The Ionian Islands are arranged in the following manner: 3 out ofthe five larger ones are grouped together in a central position \u2014 Cephalonia, the largest of all, opposite the entrance of the Gulf of Corinth ; Leucadia, about 6 m. to the N., converging towards the coast of Northern Greece ; and Zante, about 9 m. S. of Cephalonia, off the coast of Morea. The remaining two are situated \u2014 Corfu far away to the N., at the entrance of the Strait of Otranto. and Cerigo far away to the S., off C. Malia. Of the lesser islands we may specify Thiaki (Itliaca), near Cephalonia ; Kalamo and Meganisi, be tween Leucadia and the mainland; Paxo, S. of Corfu; and Cerigotto, between Cerigo aud Candia. The general characteristics of the Ionian Isles are \u2014 lofty and picturesque mountains; bold, abrupt, and deeply indented coasts ; rugged and uneven surfaces ; and deficient water supply. With the exception of Cerigo, the islands have more wood than the mainland ; groves of olive, cypress and ilex are common, and the Black Mt. of Cephalonia derives its name from the pine forests that clothe its sides. The ravines and valleys opening out to the sea are generally well cultivated, and present a verdant and soft aspect. Zante and Corfu have a larger proportion of such ground than the rest, and Zante ranked as the \" Flower of the Levant \" in the eyes of the Vene tians ; Cephalonia is generally rugged ; Leucadia soft in the S. and E., aud rugged in the N. ; and Cerigo rugged throughout. The loftiest points are the Black Mt. in Cephalonia (5259 ft.), San Salvador in Corfu (2900 ft.), aud Mt. St. Elias in Leucadia (3000 ft.); on the S. coast of this latter island is the precipice known as Sappho's Leap, where the rocks descend sheer 200 ft. to the sea. The climate of the islands is temperate, but variable. The products consist of a certain amount of corn, insufficient for the requirements of the population, currants, for which Zante is most famed, oil, and wine, of which Thiaki produces the best quality. The pitch-wells of Zante, the salt produced from the lagunes of Leucadia, and the honey of Cerigo, may be"], [331, "Chap. XIV. IONIAN ISLANDS, CYCLADES, EUB\u0152A, ETC. 315 noticed. The resources of the islands have been rendered available by the admirable roads constructed by the British Government. The most valuable of the islands, in a military point of view, is Corfu, from its position in reference to the entrance of the Adriatic and the coaat of Albania ; hence this was the chief depot aud seat of government under the Venetian and British administrations. The leading harbours are at the towns of Corfu aud Zante, at Argostoli iu Cephalonia, Aniax ichi iu Leucadia, aud Bathy in Thiaki. Corfu was until lately one of the strongest fortresses in Europe ; but the forts wero demolished before the British protectorate was terminated. The Ionian Islands were held by the Venetians for about 400 years down to 1797, and numerous traces of their rule survive \u2014 the forts at Corfu, the street architecture (colonnades) there and at Zante, and the use of the Italian language. After a brief tenure of the islands by France, they were formed in 1800 into a Septinsular Republic under the protection of Russia and Turkey. In 1807 France again held them, but she was displaced by the British, and in 1815 the Septinsular Republic was re established under their sole Protectorate, and continued in their hauds until the voluntary cession thereof in 1863. (2) The Cyclades.\u2014 The Cyclades lie between the 36th and 38th parallels, and are arranged in 3 rows \u2014 the eastern or outer one of which appears to be a continuation of Eub\u0153a, and the western or inner one, of Attica. The eastern islands are \u2014 Andro, Tino, My koni, Naxia, and Amorgo ; the western \u2014 Zea, Therinia, Serpho, Siphanto, Milo, Kimdlo or Argentiera, and Polycandro ; and the central, between the eastern and western \u2014 Jura, Syra, Paro, Antiparo, Nio, Sfkino, Santorin, and Anaphi. These islands have some features in common : they are lofty, rocky, bare, and parched : they differ, however, in the degree to which these characteristics are developed, and have each its own specific character. Syra i3, in a commercial point of view, what Delos was in a religious point of view in old times, the centre of the group, and the scat of a most extensive commerce which has sprung up within the last 30 years ; the island has a commodious port at Syra or Hermdpolis, a place with 18,511 inhabit ants. Tino and Siphanto have an exceptionally good supply of water, and rank as the most fertile of the group. Naxia, the first in point of size, and Andro, the second in that respect, are also fertile, and the former is well furnished with groves of fruit-trees. The productions of the Cyclades are oil, wine, corn, silk, and cotton. Tino is famous for its malmsley wine, and Sikino and Santorin produce wines of good quality. The chief product of Zea is the Valonia acorn, largely used for tanning. Santorin is remarkable for its volcanic phenomena (see Introd. cap. 2, \u00a7 10), and Antiparo for its stalactite cavern. Several of the islands are all but deserted : Milo from the malaria, Delos and Rhen\u0153a from their barrenness, and Anaphi from the same cause. There are admirable natural harbours on Milo, Nio, Mycono, and Paro (at Naussa). The Cyclades were formed into an independent state, under the title of the Duchy of Naxos, by a Venetian adventurer in 1204; this survived till 1566, and there is still a considerable admixture of western settlers, adherents of the Roman Church, on the islands. (3) Eub\u0153a and the Northern Sporades.\u2014 'Eub\u0153a, the largest of the Greek islands, runs parallel to the E. coast of Northern Greece, and has a length of 115 m., a mean breadth of 15 m., an area of 1700 sq. m., and a population of 72,368. Lofty mountain-ranges traverse it in proximity to the E. coast, which is rock-bound and inaccessible. The v 2"], [332, "316 CREECE. Book I, W. of the island contains plains which yield large quantities of grain, and wine of good quality. It bas been already stated that a bridge across the narrow strait of Euripus connects the island with the main land. The Northern Sporades are intersected by the 39th parallel, and consist of Skyro, the largest of the group, E. of Eub\u0153a ; Skiatho, Scdpelo, and Kilidromi, N. of Eub\u0153a ; and various scattered islets. Bkyro is well watered, and produces in its N. portion corn, wine, and figs. Scopelo is fertile and flourishing : wine, oil, and citrons are its products. Skiatho is very well wooded, but unproductive. There are fine natural harbours on Kilidromi and Skiatho. (4) Western Sporades. \u2014 Under the title of the Western Sporades we include the isles of the Saronic Gulf, viz.: Kuluri (Salamis), and Egi'na ; and the 3 coast islands off the Argolic peninsula \u2014 Poro, Hydra, and Spezzia. Euluri and Egina are unimportant; the former barren and rugged, the latter fertile, picturesque, and healthy. Poro has risen to note as the seat of the Hellenic dockyard. Hydra is an utterly barren island, but possesses one of the most remarkable towns in Greece, which previously to the revolution was an independent re public with a commercial population of 40,000 ; the Hydriotes, mainly Albanians, distinguished themselves in the war of the Revolution, and produced several illustrious leaders, particularly Kiaulis. The popu lation has now fallen to about 10,000. Spezzia bears a close resem blance to Hydra in character and history. \u00a7 4. Inhabitants, Government, Religion, and Education, &c. \u2014 The population of Greece consists mainly of Greeks and Albanians, in the proportion of three-fourths of the former to one- fourth of the latter. The modern Greeks have a large admixture of Slavonian blood in their veins, so large, indeed, that their claim as a nation to be regarded as the repre sentatives of the ancient Hellenes has been contested. In remote spots the old race may have retained its integrity : the wild Mainotes of Mount Taygetus are regarded as descendants of the Spartans, and the Psariots of Syra (the former occupants of Psyra) have the true Hellenic profile. The Albanians are numerous in the islands, and almost monopolize Hydra and Spez zia. The Greeks are lively, versa tile, brave, and patriotic ; vain and mendacious ; keen in trade and not Modem Greeks. over-scrupulous. The islanders are more hardy than the occupants of the mainland. The Albanians are less lively, and more industrious aud determined than the Greeks. The Greek language has survived"], [333, "Chap. XIV. GOVERNMENT, POLITICAL DIVISIONS, ETC. 317 with singular integrity, and is styled Romaic, a term which has descended from the period of the Byzantine Empire, when the inha bitants of the eastern provinces assumed the title of Romans.1 The Romaic has been raised to a modern literary standard by various additions and modifications, and to this new form the title of Neo- Hellenic is affixed. Government, &c. \u2014 The government is a limited monarchy with a single chamber of 170 members chosen by universal suffrage. It does not, however, appear that the Greeks are ripe for representative institutions ; matters are constantly at a dead-lock at Athens, and brigandage is rampant in the country. The Greek Church prevails almost exclusively ; its ecclesiastics are very numerous, and its estates unduly large. The Roman Church has some footing on the Ionian Isles and the Cyclades. Education is systematically conducted by the State, and there are universities at Athens and Corfu. The occupations of the people are agriculture, commerce, and sea-faring ; there are no manufactures. The chief export is currants; the bulk of the commerce is carried on with Great Britain, France, and Turkey. The only carriage-roads in Continental Greece are from Athens to Pir\u00e6us and from Athens to Thebes. \u00a7 5. Political Divisions, Towns, &c. \u2014 Greece is divided into 14 nomarchies, which are subdivided into eparchies, and these into demes. We append a list of the nomarchies with their chief towns. The first 4 belong to Northern Greece and Eub\u0153a, the 5 next to the Morea, and the 4 last to the Ionian Islands. There is little to notice in reference to the towns ; they have suffered so much from the ravages of war and from the decay of national prosperity, that they contain few buildings worthy of notice. Modern Athens has much the appearance of a German town in its 1 The name Morea, generally referred to the mulberry-tree, either from its abundance or from the resemblance of the coast to its leaf, is more probably a transmuted form of Romeo.

Nauplia was originally selected for that purpose ; its admirable harbour and strong defences give it great advantages. Under the Turks Tripolitza was the capital of the Morea, and Livadia of Northern Greece ; both have sunk to a second-rate position, and an attempt has been made to supersede Tripolitza by rebuilding Sparta. Argos is still a consider able town, though it has frequently suffered from war. Syra or Hermopolis, the capital of the Cyclades, is quite of modern date, and has succeeded to the commercial position which Hydra and Spezzia enjoyed in the early part of this century. Corfu is the capital of the Ionian Isles, and Zante is a flourishing commercial town. Patras owes its modern importance to the export of currants to Western Europe, and Vostitza, in Achaia, is similarly engaged. Noteworthy Objects. \u2014 The remains of antiquity are comparatively few. The most remarkable are as follows : \u2014 Athens, the Temple of Theseus, N.W. of the Acropolis, nearly perfect, and used as a museum ; the fine columns of the Temple of Olympian Zeus, the Arch of Hadrian, and the choragic monument of Lysicrates, E. of the Acropolis ; the so called Temple of the Winds, N. of the Acropolis ; and, on the Acro polis itself, the beautiful remains of the Parthenon, which was partly destroyed in 1687 and further in 1827; the remains of the Erechtheum with the caryatid portico ; the restored Temple of Victory ; and the re mains of the Propyl\u00e6a. \u00c6gina, ruins of the Temple of Minerva, striking both in themselves and from then' position.

The Turkish Empire \u2014 its Position, Area, and Popula tion \u2014 Historical Geography. \u2014 The Turkish Empire is a vast aggregation of territories situated for the most part about the shores of the eastern basin of the Mediterranean on the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa \u2014 a straggling, incoherent, and hetero genous mass, the outlying portions of which yield a merely nominal suzerainty, while the central or governing body is held together by external pressure rather than by its own strength or vitality.

Montenegro was ceded by the peace of Passarowicz in 1718, and the only addition to the Empire of late years has been a portion of Bessarabia, which was attached to Moldavia in 1856 by the peace of Paris. The chief losses sustained by the Empire have been Hungary, which it held from 1526 to 1686, Transylvania, lost in 1699, the Crimea, which it held from 1475 to 1774, Bessarabia, which was separated from Moldavia in 1812, and Greece, which established its independence in 1829. \u00a7 7. Turkey in Europe \u2014 its Boundaries and Divisions \u2014 Importance of its Position \u2014 Military Geography. \u2014 Turkey in Europe comprises all that lies between the Carpathians and the Archipelago, and between the Dinaric Alps and the Black Sea. On the N. its boundary from W, to E. follows the rivers Unna, Save, and Danube in succession to Orsova, then the Carpathians on the side of Transylvania, and then a conventional line which strikes across to the Pruth, follows that river until it meets the 47th parallel, then deviates E. to the Jalpuch, and leaves the mid-course of that river to strike the Black Sea in lat. 45\u00b0 50' so as to include all the mouths of the Danube. On the E. it abuts on the Black Sea, the Archipelago, and the enclosed seas between these two. On the S. it adjoins Greece between the Gulfs of Volo and Arta, while on the W. it holds the Adriatic from the G. of Arta to 42\u00b0 10\" N. lat., and thenceforward, with the exception of the two fragments entitled Suttorina and Kleck, which isolate the circle of Ragusa, it is sepa rated from the Adriatic by Dalmatia. Within the above limits are two great natural divisions, viz. : the basin of the Danube in the N., and the Balkan Peninsula in the S. ; and two great political divisions, viz, : Turkey Proper, and the Suzerain Provinces of Rou mania, Servia, and Montenegro, these latter occupying an area of 69,634 sq. m., -with a population exceeding 5 millions. Importance of its Position. The geographical position of Turkey, resting on the Black Sea and the Archipelago, and commanding the straits between these two seas, renders it an object of interest to the commercial countries of Western Europe. If a first-rate military and naval state were in possession of Constantinople, it would have the power not only of sealing up the Black Sea and, as a necessary conse quence, the Danube, 'but it would also exercise great influence through out the Levant, and might get the control of the overland route to the East through Egypt. Hence any encroachments on the Turkish Empire (and particularly on the part of Russia, which would be vastly advantaged by gaining such a position) are viewed with jealousy by the other great states of Europe, whose interest it is to preserve the neutrality of the Black Sea and the Levant. For this reason the 1 The navigation of the Lower Danube is under the control of a European Commission created in 1856, which holds its sittings at Galatz."], [337, "Chap. XIV. COAST-LINE, HARBOURS, ETC. 321 integrity of the Turkish Empire is a matter of European interest, and the various difficulties connected with this object form that in tricate \"Eastern Question\" of which the world hears so much. Military Geography. \u2014 The point of chief importance in the military geography of Turkey is the protection of its northern frontier. For this purpose a chain of fortresses guards the line of the Save and Danube, among which Belgrade holds the first place, both from its commanding position in reference to Hungary, and from its own inherent strength ; its value to the Empire is, however, much impaired by its being in Servia, and now held by the Servians. W. of Belgrade there are fortresses at Zvornik on the Driua, Banyaluka on the Verbas, and Bihacz on the Unna. Below Belgrade there follow Semendria and New Orsova, the latter built on an island in the Danube, both in Servia. Farther down, in Bulgaria, Turkey has the 3 strong fortresses of Widdin, Rustchuk, and Silistria, backed by a second line of defence on the Balkan, the key of which, as far as the lower Danube is con cerned, is Shumla, a place of immense strength, both naturally and artificially. The sea- approaches to Constantinople are readily defen sible, but the present works are insufficient for the purpose. The Bosporus is defended by the castles of Anadoli and Rumeli, S. of Therapia; and the Dardanelles by three pairs of castles, the New Dardanelles (Sed Bahr and Kum Kale'si) at the S. entrance, the Old Dardanelles (Kilid Bahr and Sultaui Hissar) about 12 m. further up the strait, and a third pair yet higher up at Bohalie' in Europe and Nagara in Asia. \u00a7 8. Coast-line and Harbours. \u2014 European Turkey possesses a seaboard on the Archipelago, the Black Sea, the Adriatic, and the Ionian Seas, with an adequate supply of harbourage on each. (1) The coast ofthe Archipelago is irregular ; immediately N. of Greece is the 0. of Volo, approached by the Trikeri Channel, and having a good port at Volo, the natural outlet for the productions of Thessaly. On the N. coast the Chalcidian peninsula projects into the sea between the Gulfs of Saloniki and Orfani, and breaks up into 3 minor peninsulas, terminating in Capes Paliuri, Drepano, and St. George, and inclosing between them the two long Gulfs of Cassandra and Monte Santo. The principal port in this section of the coast is Saloniki, with a good har bour, and backed by an extensive and very fertile region. E. of the peninsula there are inferior ports at Orfani, Kavala, and Enos at the mouth of the Maritza. At the N.E. angle of the Archipelago is the G. of Saros, which, with the Dardanelles, incloses the long tongue of land anciently known as the Chersonesus. The Dardanelles attain their minimum width of 2 m. at Gallipoli, one of the best harbours in Turkey, and the proper outlet for the products of the Maritza valley, which, however, do not reach it for want of roads. On the Sea of Marmara there is an exposed roadstead at Rodosto ; and at the S. entrance of the Bosporus the Golden Horn furnishes a secure and capacious harbour to Constantinople. (2) The coast-line of the Black Sea, between the Bosporus and the Danube, is tolerably regular. The chief ports are :\u2014 Burgas, a sheltered and deep harbour, serving p 3"], [338, "322 TURKEY IN EUROPE. Book I. as the emporium for the Eastern Balkan; Varna, which communi cates with Rustchuk on the Danube, and is destined to be the chief outlet for the grain of Wallachia ; and Kustendji, an open roadstead, which communicates with Tchernavoda on the Danube, and is also engaged in the grain traffic. (3) The Adriatic coast-line in Albania is open and regular, with bays that furnish good- harbours at Durazzo and Avlona, the latter spacious, and sheltered by the projec tion of C. Linguetta, and from its position, opposite Brindisi in Italy, likely to rise to importance. (4) The Ionian sea has an inlet on the border of Greece, the G. of Arta, with a moderately good harbour, Prevesa, at the outer end of the tortuous strait leading up to it. \u00a7 9. Configuration \u2014 the Danube-basin and the Balkan Peninsula. \u2014 The two great natural divisions into which European Turkey falls, viz., the basin of the Danube and the Balkan penin- sula, are divided from each other by the Balkan range, and are sub- divided by ranges emanating either from the Balkan or from the Dinaric Alps in the W. The general direction of these ranges has been already described in Cap. I., \u00a7 6. The two systems appear to meet in the massive mountain-knot of Scardo or Tchar-Dagh, about the point where the 21st meridian intersects the 42nd parallel. The Dinaric Alps, which diverge N.W. from that point, consist of a series of parallel ranges skirting the Adriatic, and enclosing valleys or plateaus running in the direction of the ranges. The Balkan system, which runs nearly due E., consists at first of detached ranges, but beyond the 24th meridian of a very massive and rugged mountain barrier, which preserves its continuity to the 26th meridian, and there breaks up into 3 branches, the northern of which, entitled the Little Balkan, terminates in C. Kalagria, the central one in C. Emineh, while the southern continues parallel to the Black Sea down to the Bosporus. (1) The Danube-basin, or northern division of Turkey, is divided into two sections by a wedge-like mass of highlands, emanating, to all appearance, equally from the Dinaric Alps and the Balkan, and meeting the Carpathian Mountains on the banks of the Danube, which they hem in with a precipitous gorge at Orsova. The eastern section comprises the Wallachian Plain between the Danube and Carpathians : the western opens out to- wards the Hungarian Plain, but here Turkey possesses only so much of the basin as lies S. of the Danube and the Save, and which is throughout rugged. (2) The Balkan Peninsula is seamed with lofty mountain ranges, which break it up into numerous sections. In the W. the Dinaric Alps are continued in a dorsal chain which forms the watershed between the Archipelago on the E. and the Adriatic and Ionian seas on the W., and terminates in the well-known chain of Pindus. At the point where this is intersected by the 40th parallel, and where Metzovo attains the culminating height of"], [339, "Cuap. XIV. HYDROGRAPHY. 323 8950 ft., it sends out spurs E. and W., the first containing the Voluzza Mts. and Olympus, the other ending in C. Linguetta (the Acro-Ceraunian Prom.) on the Adriatic. Proceeding E., 3 massive lines of highland may be observed to. proceed S. from the Balkan range ; the first between the rivers Vardar and Struma, terminating in the triple promontories of the Chalcidian peninsula with the conical peak of Athos (6778 ft.) ; the second between the Struma and the Kara-su ; the third and most important, the Despoto range, between the Kara-su and the Maritza, a rugged, lofty, and broad mass, which completely encloses the basin of the Maritza on the S.W. \u00a7 10. Hydrography \u2014 Rivers. \u2014 The hydrography of European Turkey is deserving of special study, inasmuch as the rivers have pointed out the great natural routes across the mountain barriers of this rugged region. The disposition of the rivers is favourable for this purpose : the Maritza and the Morava, for instance, supply a direct route between Constantinople and the Middle Danube ; the Vardar and the Ibar do the same between Saloniki and the Save. The Maritza itself communicates with the Isker by the Soulu- Derbend, and with the Struma by the Kis-Derbend, leading re spectively to Sophia and Kostendil ; and, more E., its affluent, the Tundja, communicates from two points, Kasanlik and Slivno, with the Yantra at Ternova. The sources of the rivers are frequently fonnd in close proximity to each other on the great mountain-knots to which we have referred in the last section. Thus, from Metzovo flow, in different directions, the Kara-su N.E. to the G. of Saloniki, the Salembria S.E. to the Archipelago, the Voyussa N.W. to the Adriatic, the Arta and the Aspropotamo S. to the Ionian Sea. Tbe Varda, the eastern Morava, and the Ibar rise near each other on the high ground about Tchar-Dagh ; the Maritza, the Struma, the Isker, and some of the branches of the eastern Morava, converge to a point near the W. end of Balkan proper. We proceed to give some particu lars 'as to the rivers, according as they belong to the basins of (1) the Danube, (2) the Archipelago, (3) the Adriatic and Ionian seas. (1) The Danube-basin. \u2014 The portions of the Danube-basin that fall within the Turkish Empire are : \u2014 ; 1 ) Both banks from the Black Sea to New Orsova ; (2) the rt. bauk from New Orsova to the confluence of the Save ; and (3) the rt. bank of the Save to the confluence of the Unna. Of these sections the most important is the first, which iucludes the Wallachian plain. In the upper part of this plain, the Danube skirts its southern edge in proximity to the spurs of Balkan ; below Rustchuk, however, it diverges from the hills in a N.E. direction, and has open country on both sides of it thence to the sea. At Tclierna vdda it approaches within 35 m. of the Black Sea, from which it is separated by a ridge of rolling downs, 190 ft. high. The insulated plain between tbe sea and the circuitous river-course is known as the Dobrudscha. Throughout the whole of the plain the Danube divides"], [340, "324 TURKEY IN EUROPE. Book I. and subdivides its Btream, enclosing long islands ', lakes and morasses frequently fringe its banks, particularly in Moldavia. The affluents on both banks are very numerous ; the most noticeable on the 1. bank are the Aluta, which rises on the W. flank of the Carpathians and gives access to Transylvania j the Sereth aud the Pruth, both of which have their sources in the N.E. Carpathians, and open the way to Galicia from the lower plain ; and on the rt. bank the Isker and the Yantra. (2) In the second section the most noticeable feature is the Morava, the river of Servia, which joins the Danube below Belgrade, and has a basin of great extent leading to the very heart of the Turkish pro vinces; it is formed by two branches \u2014 the western, which rises on the borders of Bosnia and receives an important affluent in the Ibar from the S. ; and the eastern, which rises on the borders of Roumelia and also receives an important affluent in the Nissava, which rises in the heart of the Veliki-Balkan. (3) In the third section we have to notice the affluents of the Save, which traverse a rugged country \u2014 the Drina dividing Servia and Bosnia, the Bosna, or river of Bosnia, the Verbas, and the Unna. (2) The Archipelago. \u2014 Proceeding from E. to W. we meet with : \u2014 The Maritza, the most important of the rivers on this coast, draining the whole region between the Balkan and Despoto by the aid of ita affluents, the Tundja from Balkan, the Arda from Despoto, and the Erkeneh from the maritime or S.E. branch of Balkan; the Struma, which joins the Archipelago E. of the Ohalcidian peninsula, flowing in its lower course through the marsh or lagune of Tikinos : the Vardar, which flows into the G. of Saloniki after traversing a broad and fertile valley ; and the Salembria (the ancient Peneus), which drains the hill girt basin of Thessaly, escaping to the sea tbrough the defile of Tempe. (3) The Adriatic and Ionian Seas. \u2014 From N. to S. : the Drin, com posed of 2 branches, which meet near Tchar-Dagh, the White Drin from the Dinaric Alps, the Black Drin from Lake Oehrida in the S. ; the Voyussa, which reaches the sea amid lagunes to the N. of C. Linguetta; the Kalamas, which traverses a fertile region and discharges itself opposite Corfu ; the Arta, which flows into the G. of the same name ; and the Aspro-potamo, whose upper course alone belongs to Turkey. \u00a7 11. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The climate and soil of Turkey are extremely favourable to agricultural operations. The temperature varies, of course, widely in different localities, and as a general rule is liable to a degree of cold that would hardly be expected in so low a latitude. The summer heat, on the other hand, is somewhat severe on the coasts. The mean temperature at Constantinople is 56\u00b0 3', the winter temperature 40\u00b0 8', and the summer 71\u00b0 2'. Rich valleys and plains, adapted to arable purposes, are intermingled with uplands that yield fine and abundant pasture. But, partly from peculiarities in the tenure of the land, partly from want of roads, and partly from apathy, the agricultural wealth of the country is undeveloped. The chief productions are grain (including maize), wool, tobacco (the best being produced about Kavala and Drama, E. of Saloniki), silk (about Adrianople, Volo in Thessaly, and in Southern Albania), opium, and cotton. The forests yield the Valonia acorn, valuable for tanning. Minerals exist in the"], [341, "Chap. XIV. ETHNOLOGY, GOVERNMENT, ETC. 325 mountains of Roumelia, among them coal ; but, with the exception of lead-mines on Mount Pelion, they are not worked. \u00a7 12. Ethnology, Government, Religion, &c. \u2014 The population of European Turkey is of a most heterogeneous character as regards the two leading elements of nationality \u2014 race and language. The Slavonian race is numerically predominant, particularly along the rt. bank of the Danube and Save : to it belong the Bulgarians (4J millions), the Servians (lj millions), and the majority of the in habitants of Bosnia, Herzegowina, and Montenegro, giving a total of 7s millions, or about half of the whole population of the country to this branch. The Roumanian element holds the second place in point of numbers (4 J millions) : they are chiefly located on the plains of Wallachia and Moldavia, but are also found in scattered colonies on the Balkan peninsula, and particularly in Thessaly. They derive their indigenous name and their language from the Romans, who planted colonies in Dacia, and from whom they claim to be descended, though they are probably of very mixed origin. The Albanians (Arnauts as the Turks call them, Skipetares \" moun taineers \" as they call themselves) are variously estimated at from 1,300,000 to 1,600,000; they hold Albania, and are found elsewhere on the Balkan peninsula. The Greeks (about a million) are ubi quitous on the shores of the Archipelago, and in the large towns S. of the Balkan ; no people are brought into closer contact or more frequent collision with the Turks. The Turks themselves, or (as they are more properly termed) the Osmanli, though the dominant race, are numerically insignificant, being variously estimated at from 1,055,000 to 1,500,000. They entered Europe as conquerors in the 14th cent., and still seem to be \" encamped \" rather than settled in Europe, where their religion, coupled with their social and political system, interposes an insurmountable barrier against their naturalization. They have many estimable qualities \u2014 bravery, kindness, courtesy, and dignity ; on the other hand they are fanatical, vain, indolent, and apathetic. The sojourners from Western Europe are termed Franks, and are rarely found far from the seaboard. Government. \u2014 Turkey is ruled by an emperor or sultan, who com bines the highest spiritual and civil dignities, and is supposed to con duct his government according to the laws of the Koran. He must be a scion of the house of Osman, who died in 1326 ; and, according to custom, the eldest male heir, not necessarily the eldest son, succeeds to the throne. Next to the emperor come the heads of the temporal and spiritual departments, viz., the grand vizier and the mufti, the former of whom is the president of the divan or council of ministers. These officers are appointed by the sultan. Of late years the Turkish rulers have endeavoured to assimilate their institutions to those of other European states, and this new policy is embodied in the two fundamental edicts of 1839 (the Tanzimah) and 1856 (the Hatti- Humayoun), the former having regard to effective and just civil"], [342, "326 TURKEY IN EUROPE. Book I. administration, the latter to religious toleration, the privileges of foreigners, and other international matters. This policy is opposed by a large section of the Turks, and has been but imperfectly carried out. Among the special causes of weakness in the Turkish government may be noticed (1) the extravagance of the sultans iu the maintenance of their harems ; (2) the financial embarassments ofthe public exchequer; (3) the peculation and venality of the public officers ; (+) the un developed state of the resources of the country ; and (5j the want of roads, banks, and postal arrangements. Religion. \u2014 The numerical inferiority, combined with the political superiority, of the Mohammedans, forms one of the greatest, if not the greatest, source of weakness to the Ottoman empire. The statistical statements do not supply exact returns of the numbers of the respective communities, inasmuch as for this purpose Egypt1 is brought under the head of Europe. In Turkey Proper the Mohammedans and Christians appear to be nearly equal, the former preponderating largely in Lower Bulgaria. The Suzerain Provinces, on the other hand, are almost exclusively Christian, so that in the whole of European Turkey the Christians about double the Mohammedans. The Christians be long chiefly to the Greek Church, the (Roman) Catholic Church num bering only 640,000 according to the returns, which however are again clearly defective, inasmuch as they also represent this as the number of Roman Catholics proper, to the exclusion of other religious com munities, such as United Greeks, United Armenians, and others, who acknowledge the supremacy of the Roman Pontiff Agriculture. \u2014 Turkey is essentially an agricultural country, but the farming system is of the most antiquated description, and tbe imple ments rude to a degree. Much of the land lies waste. In spite, however, of all these drawbacks, the produce of grain is more than sufficient for the wants of the people. Manufactures. \u2014 The manufactures are wholly domestic. Tlie weaving of the woollen ablias is perhaps the most important branch of industry. The other noticeable articles are carpets (chiefly in Bulgaria I, leather work, filagree ornaments, and tobacco-pipes (at Constantinople), attar of roses (at Adrianople), and silk in the silk-producing districts. Commerce. \u2014 The vast resources of the Turkish provinces are so imperfectly developed that the commerce is on a most restricted scale.' The chief exports are grain, wool, silk, tobacco, cotton, and hides; and the chief imports, Manchester goods, metals, and colonial produce. The silk is chiefly exported to Marseilles, the hides to Trieste, and the grain to England. Communications. \u2014 European Turkey suffers wofully from the mise rable deficiency cf roads and canals throughout the whole country. The products of the interior are conveyed to the seaboard either on horseback or on rafts by the rivers. Each large town is isolated from its neighbours, and becomes the independent centre of its own circle. Bosnia and South Albania are ahead of the other districts in regard to roads ; elsewhere there are mere tracks or natural roads along which no cart can pass. The only railways are the two between the Danube and the Black Sea at Kustendji and Varna, and in these Wallachia is more interested than Turkey Proper. \u00a7 13. Political Divisions. \u2014 For administrative purposes the i See Gotha Almanac for 1866. The religious do not tally with the civil statistics iD this case."], [343, "Chap. XIV. POLITICAL DIVISIONS. 327 Turkish empire is divided into eyalets or governments, with suc cessive subdivisions into livas or provinces, kazas or districts, and nahijs or parishes. Turkey Proper has 5 eyalets, viz.: Edirne (Thrace), Touna (Bulgaria), Bosna, Tunia (Epirus), and Salonici; the Suzerain provinces also form nominal eyalets under the names of Boghdan (Moldavia), Iflak (Wallachia), and Syrp (Servia). These divisions, however, are of little interest to the world at large, which retains in part the classical and in other instances ethnological designations. Thus the provinces bordering on the Archipelago are generally described under the classical titles of Thrace, Macedonia, and Thessaly, though they are also collectively known as Roumelia, from the Turkish Rum-ili \" country of the Romans,\" as the subjects of the Eastern emperors were called. On the coast of the Adriatic the classical names, Epirus and Illyricum, have been superseded by Albania, which became current for this region probably in the 13th cent. Bosnia retains its Turkish title, which is derived from the river Bosna ; the eyalet includes the district of Herzegowina or Hertschek, meaning the \"duchy\" of St. Sabas, who was here martyred. The only other division to be noticed is Bulgaria, a most important region between the Danube and the Balkan, cor responding to the ancient M\u0153sia, and deriving its present name from a Tartar horde, who in the 7th cent, subdued and subsequently amalgamated with the Slavonians previously occupying it.

Internally they have generally narrow, tortuous, and filthy streets, with neither pavement nor lights. The shops are collected together in certain spots (bazaars) under arcades. Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish empire, carries off the palm among the capitals of Europe for beauty of situation. The Turks call it Stamboul, after the Greek expression (es rav irokiv) for \" the city \" par excellence. The city proper stands on a triangular space, of which the apex juts out E. into the Bos porus, the S. side is formed by the Sea of Marmara, and the N. side by the inlet called the Golden Horn, while the W. side or base connects with the mainland. On the opposite side of the Golden Horn are the suburbs of Pera and Galata. The streets are no better than those of Turkish towns in general, and are infested with dogs which act as public scavengers. Adrianople, the second city of Turkey, is well situated in the heart of the Maritza basin, where the Tundja joins the main steam ; it is the commercial centre of a large and rich district. Saloniki has already been noticed as one of the leading ports in Turkey. Among the commercial towns of the interior may be noticed Monastir, midway between Saloniki and Durazzo ; Joanina, the capital of Epirus, and surrounded by an extremely fertile province ; Bosna-Sera'i, the capital of Bosnia, and the place where the southern route from Saloniki branches off to various points on the Save ; Sophia, a mest important station on the great route between Constantinople and Belgrade ; Ternova, the old capital of Bulgaria, and still important as the point of transit across the Balkan ; and Babadagh, the chief town of the Dobrudscha. The great fortresses of Bulgaria, Shumla, Rustchuk, Silistria, and Widdin are among the most populous and important of the Turkish towns.

A chain of mountains traverses it in the direction of its length, culminating in Mt. Psiloriti, the ancient Ida (7674 ft.), which occupies a central position in the chain. The N. coast is much indented by bays and promontories : the S. coast is comparatively regular, and is devoid of good harbourage. The most prominent points are Capes Buso and Spada in the N.W., C. Krio iu the S.W., C. Sidero in the N.E., C. Salmone in the E., and C. Matala in the S. The N. coast has fine harbours at Canea, Retimo, aud Candia or Megalokastro. The scenery of the island is magnificent, its climate generally fine, and its soil extremely rich. But its great natural resources are undeveloped, and the antipathy of the inhabitants, two-thirds of whom are Greeks, to their Turkish rulers has resulted in rancorous and destructive wars, among which that of 1866 will ever be memorable. The chief products of the island are olive-oil, soap, and a particular kind of cheese made at Spakia, on the S. coast, and much prized throughout the Levant. These are the principal exports ; the imports are manufactured goods, grain, and tobacco. Candia is the capital of the island, and is historically famous for the long defence which the Venetians here made against the Turks, 1645-1655. Canea and Retimo are the other provincial capitals. The Turkish Sporades, though now attached to Asia by the Turks, belong physically to Europe. The most noticeable of these islands are Thaso, off the coast of Thrace ; Samothraki and Imbro, off the coast of the Chersonesus ; and Stalimene, the ancient Lemnos, consisting of two peninsulas conected by an isthmus, with bare rocky hills, and valleys fertile in grain, oil, wine and silk. \u00a7 15. The Suzerain Provinces : their Geographical Posi tion, Government, Towns, &c. \u2014 The Suzerain provinces of the Turkish empire deserve special notice, as being the stage on which the great European powers come into contact not only with Turkey but with each other. This is due mainly to the geographical position of the most important of them, Roumania, which, lying open to Russia on the side of the Pruth, to Austria by the course of the Danube, and to the maritime and commercial nations of Western Europe by the Black Sea, and possessing the key to the navigation of the Danube, is an object of interest to all, both from its own intrinsic value and as a stepping-stone to the supremacy of the East. (1.) Roumania consists of the united principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, the former occupying the rich plain between the Carpathians and the Lower Danube, the latter stretching northward along the course of the Sereth, whose affluent the Moldawa gives name to the country, between the eastern Carpathians and the Pruth. The area of Roumania is 46,708 sq. m., and its population 3,864,848. The Walla chian plain possesses a remarkably rich soil, and under good manage ment would become the granary of Europe. Minerals abound in the Carpathians, but, with the exception of salt and petroleum which exudes iu the valleys, they are turned to no account. The inhabitants of Roumania are styled Roumans, and are warmly attached to the Greek Church. In point of race their affinities would lead them to a union with the Hungarian portion of the Austrian Empire ; but in point of religion Russia, as the patron of the Greek Church, claims their"], [347, "Chap. XIV. SUZERAIN PROVINCES. 331 sympathy. The towns of Roumania are poor. Bucharest, in Wallachia, is the seat of government, and Jassy, near the Pruth, is the pro vincial capital of Moldavia. On the Danube are the important ports of Galatz and Braila, the emporia of the grain-shipping business. The population of these and of the other chief towns is as follows : \u2014 Roumania is governed by a Prince or Hospodar, with the assistance of representative bodies, whose functions have hitherto been of a very subordinate character. The Roumans have set aside the regulations of the European powers in respect both to the internal independence of the two principalities and the choice of their prince, who ought to be of Roumanian descent. The Porte receives a tribute of 40,0002. a year from Roumania, and confirms the election of the Prince. (2.) Servia is a less interesting region to Europe generally than Rou mania, but has a special interest for the Slavonians as the scene of a contest between two great sections of that nationality, one of which aims at a union of the whole Slavonian family under Russia (Pan- Slavism), the other at the establishment of a separate South Slavonian state, which shall include the members of that branch now living under Austrian rule. Servia (with an area of 21,217 sq. m. and a population of 1,078,281) comprises the mountainous region that surrounds the basin of the Morava from the Drin in the W. to the Timok in the E. It opens out northwards to the Danube, with which and with the Save it has its communications. Much of the surface is covered with forests, sustaining vast herds of swine, and yielding the valuable valonia acorn, The resources of the country, which include minerals, are undeveloped : the state of morality is very low, and the interior of the country is in a disorderly state. Belgrade is the chief town, with a population of 18,860 : as long as the Turks held the fortress, the Servian government used Kragugevatz (3964), centrally situated on the Morava, as its capital. Servia is governed by a hereditary prince, and two legislative chambers. Belgrade is a place of great historical interest from the frequent sieges it has sustained, particularly in 1455, when it resisted the Turks, and in 1522, when it was taken by them. (3.) Montenegro, the Karadagh of the Turks, and the Czernagora of the Slavonians, all three names signifying \"the Black Mountain,\" is Bituated on a rugged mountain-knot of the Dinaric Alps, wedged in between Bosnia and Albania, and closely adjacent to the Adriatic. It has an area of 1709 sq. m. and a population of 196,238 natives, with a considerable addition of refugees. The inhabitants are South Slavo nians, and Christians of the Greek Church. They have gained cele brity for their dogged but unavailing resistance to Turkish rule, parti cularly in 1853 and 1861-2. The political position of Montenegro is ill-defined ; the European powers have interested themselves in its behalf, but not so effectually as in the former eases. The seat of govern ment is Cettinje, a village in a mountain-girt elevateds valley.

Position, Area, and Population \u2014 Historical Geography. \u2014 Denmark is a state of Northern Europe, situated between 54\u00b0 35 and 57\u00b0 44' N. lat., 8\u00b0 4' and 12\u00b0 37' E. long., and bounded W. by the North Sea, N. by the Skagerrack, E. by the Kattegat and the Baltic, and S. by Schleswig on the mainland. It consists of two portions : \u2014 (1) Continental, or rather Peninsular Denmark, on the northern portion of the Cimbric or Jutish peninsula which here projects N. from the mainland like a mighty breakwater between the North Sea and the Baltic : and (2) Insular Denmark or the isles"], [349, "Chap. XV. DENMARK. 333 of the Danish Archipelago, between the Kattegat and the Baltic, the chief of which are Zealand, between the Sound and the Great Belt ; Fdnen (Dan. Fyen), between the Great and Little Belts ; and Laaland (Dan. Lolland) with the adjacent Falster, at the S. entrance of the Great Belt. Denmark also possesses the detached island of Bornholm in the Baltic (15\u00b0 E. long.). The area of Denmark is 14,733 sq. m., of which the continental portion embraces 9716 sq. m., or about two-thirds; and its population (in 1860) 1,608,095, of which the insular portion absorbs 908,156, or more than one-half. Historical Geography. \u2014 The existence of the Danish state is traced back to Gorm the Old towards the close of the 9th cent. About 100 years later Norway and the most important part of Great Britain were temporarily subjected to it. The palmy days of the country were in the llth and 12th cents., when Denmark ruled over the whole S. coast of the Baltic to the Gulf of Finland. In 1397 Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were united under one sovereign by the Union of Calmar. Sweden renounced the union in 1523, and recovered her southern pro vinces in 1658. Norway was retained until 1814, when it was exchanged for Pomerania. Schleswig was lost in the war of 1864-5. \u00a7 2. Natural Features of the Mainland and Islands.\u2014 The continental portion of Denmark is a protrusion from the great European plain formed by a prolongation of the same ridge of high ground which we have already traced through Germany and into Schleswig-Holstein. This ridge approximates to the Baltic coast and breaks up in this direction into well-wooded knolls and verdant slopes, which are both picturesque and fertile. The greatest height attained is the Himmelsberg near Arhuus (550 ft.). Towards the W. the ridge subsides into a broad sandy and heathy belt sloping imperceptibly towards the North Sea, which is here fringed by shift ing encroaching sand-hills on the land and by dangerous sand banks1 and reefs beneath the sea, combining to render this coast one of the most dreary and inhospitable in the world. The rivers are very short, but lakes are numerous. The coast-line is regular on the W. and N., and comes to a point at the Skaw or Skagen (more fully Skagen's Horn, after the town Skagen) : the E. coast is more varied by bays and fiords, among which we may notice from N. to S. the Liim or Lym-fiord, a remarkable series of lagunes and connecting channels which stretches right across the peninsula, and is even connected with the North Sea by a natural but unnavigable channel formed by an irruption of the North Sea in 1825, and named the Agger-Canal ; the Manager Fiord ; Kalo Bay, N. of Aarhuus ; and Veile Fiord. The isle of Zealand is of irregular form, and is deeply penetrated from the N. coast by the Ise-Fiord, which insulates the districts on either side of it : on the E. coast are two 1 The name Skager Rick properly applies to the sandbank which lines the coast S. W from the Skaw or Skagen."], [350, "DENMARK. Book I. 334 considerable bays named after the towns Kjoge and Prasto. The interior of the island is undulating, and nowhere attains any con siderable height, the loftiest point (near Vordmgborg) being only 390 ft. Funen has much the same character : its coast is, however, more indented, and parts of the island (the W. and S.W.) are more hilly : it also has a considerable fiord named after the river Odense. Bornholm, on the other hand, has high rocky coasts and a moun tainous surface. The scenery of the Danish islands, though not grand, is remarkably pleasing and picturesque, the woods being fine, and water a very general feature in the form either of fiords, lakes, or arms of the sea. The small isle of Moen, S. of Zealand, ranks as the \" Switzerland\" of Denmark. \u00a7 3. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The climate of Denmark is favourably affected by its insularity and by the prevalence of west erly winds. The mean annual temperature of Copenhagen is 460,6, the winter 31\u00b0-3, and the summer 62\u00b0- 7 ; the average deficiency of about 4\u00b0 as compared with London is attributable mainly to the greater severity of the winter. Ice accumulates in the channels sur rounding the islands, and the Great Belt is occasionally rendered impassable between Nyborg and Korsor on this account. It is seldom, however, that the channels are so completely frozen over as they were in the winter of 1657-8, when Charles XII. transported his army with artillery, &c. from the mainland to Zealand by way of Funen, Langeland, and Laaland. Rain is abundant, and the climate is generally variable. Many parts of Denmark are well wooded : forests of beech, and occasionally of oak, are common in the eastern parts of Jutland and in Zealand. Geological research proves that the beech is of comparatively modern introduction, and 'that the old forests were composed of oak, fir, and birch. The pastures of Denmark are very rich, and support excellent breeds of cattle and horses. Wheat, flax, hemp, and tobacco are produced on the richer soils ; buckwheat and oats, on the cultivated parts of the heaths. The fisheries are valuable, particularly that of the strom m-ing, a small species of herring. Minerals are scarce : Bornholm yields limestone, potters' clay, and a little coal. \u00a7 4. Inhabitants \u2014 Government, Religion, and Education \u2014 Occupations. \u2014 The Danes, after whom the country is named (Denmark = the Dane March, or frontier), belong to the Scandi navian branch of the Teutonic race. They made their appearance on the islands in the 5th cent., and thence spread to the mainland where they overpowered the German tribes of the Angles and Jutes of Jutland ( = Jute-land). The Danes use a Scandinavian tongue closely allied to Swedish and Norwegian, with a considerable dif ference between the dialects current in the continental and insular portions. They are simple-minded, hardy, industrious, and patriotic."], [351, "Chap. XV. INHABITANTS, GOVERNMENT, ETC. 335 Gypsies (called Icjoltringer or \" rascals \") are almost the only occu pants of the heaths of Jutland. Numerous memorials of the early inhabitants of Denmark exist in the form of sepulchral tumuli (such as that at Udleire near Frederickssund, and those near Ribe in Jut land), columns with Runic inscriptions (such as the Jellinge stones near Veile), and tlie midden-heaps (kjokkenmoddinger) which have afforded curious information as to the food and habits of a primeval race. Government, Religion, and Education. \u2014 Denmark is a Constitutional Monarchy. The executive is vested in the King, who acts through responsible ministers : the legislative power is shared between him and a representative body styled the Rigsdag, composed of two chambers, the Landsthing or Upper Houso of 66 members, 12 of whom are nomi nated by the King, and the remainder by the nation on a system of indirect election ; and the Folksthing or Lower House, the number of the members being at the rate of 1 for each 16,000 souls. The Lutheran Church is the established form of religion in Denmark, and ia ac cepted by nine-tenths of the population. Education is widely diffused : it is rare to find a person who cannot read and write. The higher education is carried on at public schools and at the University of Copen hagen, founded in 1478. Occupations. \u2014 Agriculture is the leading occupation in Denmark, aud the Danes are careful and skilful farmers. Fishing occupies the inhabit ants of the coast, and even off the dangerous coast of Jutland a hardy sea-faring population is found so engaged. Manufactures are chiefly domestic, and consist of linen and woollen stuffs. At Copenhagen there are regular factories for these products, besides sugar-refining, tobacco, and porcelain establishments. Boruholm produces wooden clocks. Commerce is carried on largely by sea : the exports are agri cultural produce ; the imports, coal, iron, colonial produce, and Man chester goods. A line of railway crosses Zealand from Copenhagen to KorsSr, and communicates with Nyborg in Funen, whence a line is carried on to Middelfart at the narrowest part of the Little Belt oppo site to Fredericia ; another line strikes diagonally across Jutland from Aarhuus by Randers to Viborg, Skive, and Struer. \u00a7 5. Political Divisions \u2014 Towns, &c. \u2014 Colonial Possessions. \u2014For administrative purposes Denmark is divided into 19 districts (amter), of which there are 10 in Jutland and 9 in the islands. The old ecclesiastical division into dioceses (4 in Jutland and 3 in the islands) still appears to hold its ground. The more convenient divi sion, however, for the world at large is that suggested by the natural features of the country, as follows : \u2014 Divisions. Towns. Zealand . . . Bornholm ....

Copenhagen, the capital, stands on the coast of the Sound, just where a narrow channel between Zealand and the isle of Amager affords a natural harbour, from which the town derives its name of Kjobenhavn, or \" merchant's haven.\" The bulk of the town is built on Zealand, and there is a suburb on Amager, to which access is gained by a drawbridge. The town is strongly fortified, and the citadel of Frederickhaven faces the sea.

Colonial Possessions.\u2014 Denmark possesses the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Santa Cruz iu the West Indies, and a few unimportant settlements on the coast of Greenland. The two first are attached to the con tinent of Europe, and therefore call for further description iu this place. The Faroe islands are a group of 35, of which 17 are inhabited, lying N.W. of the Shetlands about the point where tlie 62nd parallel intersects 7\u00b0 W. long., having an area of 510 sq. m., and a population of 8922. They are high and rocky, enjoy a mild climate, yield barley and oats in places, and elsewhere support a fine-woolled sheep, with vast numbers of sea-fowl, from which eider-down is obtaiued. The only town is Thorshavn on Strombe, the largest of the islands. The Faroes have a legislative house (Lagthivtg), which sends a representative to the Landsthing at Copenhagen. Iceland lies N.W. of the Faroes, much nearer to the coast of Greenland than to Europe, the centre of the island being in about 19\u00b0 W. long, and 65\u00b0 N. lat. Its area is 39,692 sq. m., and its population 66,987. The island is interesting from its volcanic phenomena and its ancient civilization. It consists of a mass of rocks ranging up to 6000 ft. in height, their summits clothed with perpetual snows, and containing 7 still active volcanoes. Of these 7 Hecla (5210 ft.) is the best known, but by no means the most important : on the S.E. coast is the Or\u0153fa Jokul (6426 ft.), surrounded by an ice field covering an area of 3500 sq. m. (the hitherto unexplored Klofa Jiikul), on the W. confines of which is Skapta Jokul, whence pro ceeded the awful eruption of 1783. Among the other objects we may specify the Geysers, or hot springs, the most remarkable of which are situated near Skalholt, and consist of three springs, the Great Geyser, with a funnel-shaped cup 70 ft. in diameter and 83 ft. deep, and the two Strokrs, which have no cups ; the Great Geyser and Great Strokr throw columns about 100 ft. high, and the Little Strokr about 30 ft. The Thingvalla is a sunken plain, 8 m. broad, bounded by precipitous walls of lava, and having within its area a natural inclosure, which was formerly used as the meeting-place of the Icelandic thing or parliament. The chief resources of Iceland are fishing, fowl-catching for eider-down, and cattle-breeding : a few vegetables are reared, but no grain.

CONFIGURATION, MOUNTAINS, ETC. 339 the end of Hako IV.'s reign in 1263, during which period her fleets ruled the seas of Western Europe and her settlements extended over the Hebrides, Shetlands, Orkneys and Iceland. From 1523 to 1814 Norway remained an appendage of Denmark. The period of Sweden's greatness commences with the reign of Gustavus Adolphus in 1611. In 1645 she acquired from Denmark the Norwegian districts of Jiimt laud (about Oester3und) and Herjedalen, and the isle of Gothland ; and in 1658 the southern districts of Bohus, Schonen, and Blekingen. About the same period she also conquered the greater part of Pome rania, Esthonia, and Livonia. The two latter were ceded to Russia in 1710, and Further Pomerania to Prussia in 1720 ; but Hither Pomerania and Rugen remained to Sweden until 1814. Finland, which had be longed to Sweden for above 600 years, was acquired by Eussia in 1809. \u00a7 7. Configuration \u2014 Mountains \u2014 Fiords and Islands \u2014 Scenery. \u2014 The Scandinavian peninsula receives its conformation from a continuous series of mountains, which, entering it from Lapland in the N.E., sweep round W., S.W., and S. in close proximity to the W. coast, towards which they descend sharply, while on the other side they fall away gradually by a series of terraces. These mountains increase in height and breadth as they descend from N. to S., and throughout their whole course exhibit a tendency to plateau formation, having broad summits with no decisive crest and but few peaks. The 62nd parallel marks the spot where the most decided change in the character of the range takes place : to the N. of that limit it is a single and compact line ; to the S. of it, it ramifies in all directions and covers the whole of Southern Norway. Between the 68th and 63rd parallels the range bears the name of the Kiolen Mts. ; the mean height of this section may be about 2000 ft., and its culminating point, Sulitelma, is 6200 ft. high. More to the N. the mean height decreases to about 1500 ft., and only a few of the summits reach the limit of perpetual snow. Between the 63rd and 62nd parallels the Dovre-Field strikes off S.W. towards the Atlantic, and presents a massive barrier betwen Northern and Southern Norway : its mean height is about 3000 ft., and its culminating point Sneehatten (7620 ft.). Between 62\u00b0 and 61\u00b0 is the most intricate and lofty part of the system, including the Sogne-fleld, the Jotun-field with Galdhoppigen (8400 ft.), the culminating point of all Norway, and the Justedals-Braen with a vast expanse of glacier. S. of 61\u00b0 follow the Fille-field and the broad hacked Hardanger-fleld. Folgefond lies just under the 60th parallel, and equals, if it does not surpass, Justedals-Braen in regard to its glaciers. The central line of height is carried down to the shores of the Skagerrack, and terminates at the Lindesnaes or, as we term it, the Naze. More to the E. a line of high ground may be traced from the central region between the rivers Glommen and Dal to the southern peninsula of Sweden : these hills are known as the Seves. Fiords and Islands. \u2014 The western coast is fretted with fiords, Bome of them broad and gulf-like, as is common in the N. (Porsanger, Varanger, Q 2"], [356, "SWEDEN AND NORWAY. Book I. 340 &c ) others narrow, long, and ramifying, as is usual in the S. (Sogne, Hardanger, &a.), and others, again, with broad outlets studded with islands (as'Bukke and Christiania). The western coast is fringed with iskmds and islets, those lying N. of the 68th parallel being of consider able size, while to the S. of that limit they are for the most part mere granite rocks, now in groups and now single, and of every variety of size, shape, and appearance. These rocks are locally named Shares and form a continuous barrier (the Skdrgaard) along the W. coast to the entrance of the Kattegat. They re-appear in the Baltic and compel the Swedes to provide their fleet with a flotilla expressly adapted to man\u0153uvre in the narrow and shallow channels about them. Of the larger islands we may notice off the N.W. coast of Norway the Lofodens, a numerous group between fi7j\u00b0 and 69^\u00b0 N. lat., separated from the mainland by the channel called West-fiord and from the N\u0153roen's Fiord, a branch of the Sojjne Fiurd, Tromsoe group, which follows N.E., by the Ands-fiord ; Qualoe, on which Hammerfest is situated ; aud Mageroe with the North Cape. The sea rushes with tremendous violence into the Westfiord, and at certain states of the tide the conflicting streams, meeting in the channels between the islands or eddying in the fiords, become dangerous to open boats : hence the so-called whirlpool of the Maelstrom between Vaeroe and Moskenoe at the S. extremity of the Lofodens, the Salten-strom in the Salten -fiord, and others ofthe same kind. In the Baltic there are two large islands belonging to Sweden, viz . Oeland, close to the Swedish coast, 85 m. long and with 33,000 inhabitants; and Gothland, in the mid-sea, with an area of 1214 Bq. m., and a population of 50,137. Harbourage is abundant on the coasts of the Scandinavian peninsula : many of the Norwegian harbours are spacious and safe, but great care is requisite in approaching the coast. Between the islands and the main-"], [357, "Chap. XV. HYDROGRAPHY. 341 land a navigable channel runs along the whole W. coast, generally with smooth water. Scenery. \u2014 The western portion of the peninsula offers most magnifi cent scenery, both on the coast and inland. The fiords run up into the mountains and are sometimes hemmed in by precipitous walls of rock, and in other places (as in the S.) by banks clothed with a varied foliage. The inland valleys are long, narrow, and deeply imbedded in mountains ; among the most famous we may specify the Gudbrandsdalen, between the head of Lake Miosen and the Dovre-field ; Romsdiilen, N. of the Dovre-field between Dombaas and Molde ; Justedal, with its magnificent glaciers ; and V\u0153rdal, between Drontheim and Suudsvall. Waterfalls are very numerous : among the finest may be specified Sarp fos on the Glommen near Sarpsborg ; Larbro-fos, on the Lauveu near Kongsberg; Riukan-fos, i.e. the ' reeking-fall ' (900 ft.), on the Maan, N.W. from Kongsberg ; and the Vbring-fos (900 ft.), a perpendicular fall near the Hardanger Fiord. The falls now enumerated are in Norway: in Sweden the Gotha, after leaving Lake Weuner, descends 112 ft. by a series of 7 falls at Trollhattan, and there are fine falls on the Dal close to the Gulf of Bothnia. \u00a78. Hydrography \u2014 Eivers and Lakes. \u2014 The hydrography ofthe Scandinavian peninsula is simple : the westerly position of the range which forms the primary watershed precludes the possibility of any important rivers joining the Atlantic, and leaves a broad slope S.E. to the Gulf of Bothnia from the Kiolen Mts., and S. to the Skagerrack and Kattegat from the Dovre-field and the other southern ranges. In the former direction the rivers, confined in lateral valleys, hold independent and parallel courses to the sea, expanding in the upper terraces into lakes, and generally descending precipitately to the coast : under this head we may mention the rivers Tornea, Lulea, Pitea, Umea, and Dal. Of the rivers that seek the Kattegat we may notice the Klara which is the chief feeder of lake Wenner, and the Glommen, the largest in the peninsula, discharging itself into the Skagerrack at its N.E. angle. Lakes are an important feature in the southern peninsula of Sweden : Wenner is the receptacle of about 30 streams, and discharges its waters by the river Gotha into the Kattegat ; it is about 85 m. long and covers an area of 2015 sq. m. Lake Wetter is nearly as long, but considerably more narrow ; though not far distant from Wenner it has its outlet in the opposite direction, viz: E. to the Baltic through the Motala. Water communication has been opened between the Baltic and the Kattegat by the Gotha Canal, which connects the two lakes and evades the Falls of Trollhattan at the outlet of Lake Wenner. Lake Malar, close to Stockholm, is remarkable for the number and beauty of its islands, of which there are said to be 1400 : the lake is 75 m. long and connected with the Baltic by the Arboga. Lake Miosen, in Norway, is an irregular and very beautiful sheet of water, 63 m. long, fed by the logen or Longen and other streams, and discharging its surplus waters into the Glom men."], [358, "342 SWEDEN AND NORWAY. Book I. \u00a7 9. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The climate ofthe Scandinavian peninsula is favourably affected by the proximity of large bodies of water, and especially by the genial influence of the Gulf Stream on the coast of Norway. The ocean remains open throughout the winter as far as the Varanger Fiord. Even at the North Cape the mean annual temperature is somewhat above the freezing-point, though the degree of winter cold is occasionally excessive. Throughout the peninsula the winter is long and spring is almost unknown: the summer, on the other hand, is very hot. The mean temperature at Christiania is 41\u00b0, at Bergen 46\u00b0.8, at Drontheim 41\u00b0.7 and at Stockholm 42\u00b0.2. Bain is very abundant on the W. coast. The climate (considering the high latitude) is very favourable to vegeta tion. Wheat ripens in sheltered spots as high as Drontheim, barley and rye as high as Hammerfest. Fruit also ripens as high as 62\u00b0 N. lat. The wealth of the Scandinavian peninsula, however, consists not in its agricultural resources, but in its forests, its minerals and its fisheries. The mountains are clothed with magnificent forests, chiefly of spruce and Scotch fir : the oak and the ash are found only in the southern provinces and the beech in a single district near Laurvig: the larch has been introduced and thrives near Bergen. Sweden possesses large deposits of iron-ore at Dannemora near Upsala, at Persberg N. of Lake Wenner, and on the banks of the Lulea ; copper about Fahlun, where the mines have been worked for 600 years ; silver in small quantities at Sala, N. of Lake Malar ; gold, also of a limited amount, at Adelfors ; alum in Oeland ; the finest porphyry at Elf-dal ; cobalt, plumbago, lead, and zinc. Coal of an inferior quality is found at Hbganas in Gothland, and near Landskrona. Nor way also is rich in iron-ore of the best quality, and yields copper at Bdraas in 62\u00b0 30' N. lat. (discovered in 1645) and at Kaafiord in 70\u00b0, and silver\" at Kongsberg near Christiania, where the mine has been worked since 1624. The fisheries of Norway include the herring, which is chiefly caught between Bergen and Stavanger, the cod and sey about the Lofoden isles, the lobster between Bergen and the Naze, and the salmon which abounds in the fiords and rivers, and leads to an immigration of English sportsmen during the season. The eider-down duck is a valuable addition to the resources oi Norway. The reindeer accompanies the Nomad Lapps as far S. as about 62\u00b0 30'. \u00a7 10.

They fell into two divisions, the Goths of the S., and the Sviar or Swedes proper, who emigrated northwards to Lake Malar. They now occupy the whole of the S. and central districts, and the shores of the Gulf"], [359, "Chap. XV. INHABITANTS, ETC, OF SWEDEN. 343 of Bothnia. Finns, to the number of about 12,000, belonging to the Quan tribe, penetrate from the N. between Sweden and Norway as far S. as the sources of the Clara ; and Lapps, about 5000, occupy a belt between the Upper Dal and the Tornea. The Swedes are amiable, industrious, hospitable, and light-hearted : the Dalecarlians retain many peculiarities of dress and language. The people are divided into 4 classes \u2014 nobles, clergy, burgesses, and farmers. The small freeholder is a very numerous class in Sweden in consequence of the law of inheritance which enforces the subdivision of a property equally between the children. The nobility are also numerous, inas much as the rank is not limited to a single line, but descends equally to all children. Government, Religion and Education. \u2014 Sweden is a constitutional monarchy, the nation being represented by a Diet of two chambers, the first consisting of members elected by the provincial assemblies at the rate of 1 for each 30,000 inhabitants ; the second, of members elected partly by the country people at the rate of 1 for 40,000, partly by the large towns at the rate of 1 for 10,000, and partly by unions of small towns, by a system of indirect election. The first chamber is composed of 125 deputies, and the second of 180, of whom 130 are from the country and the rest from the towns. The Lutheran Church is almost exclusively predominant, under the Archbishop of Upsala aud 11 bishops. Education is very general, and there are universities at Upsala and Luud, founded respectively in 1478 and 1479. Occupations. \u2014 Agriculture is the leading occupation in Sweden, and great paius have of late years been taken to introduce improved methods of husbandry ; but the smallness of the farms retards progress. The amount of grain is more than sufficient for the wants of the people. The production of live-stock is well adapted to the climate and soil of the midland and northern districts ; but the breeds are small. Mining and iron-making give employment to a great number of people : the iron, being smelted with charcoal, is peculiarly suitable for cutlery and is in great request at Sheffield ; but the large consumption of wood in the manufacture is a serious matter. Textile manufactures for home consumption are carried on both in the homes of the peasants during the long winters and in a few places on a larger scale \u2014 stuffs and alpacas at Carlswick near Stockholm, where 500 looms are at work, cotton goods about Gothenburg, and lace at Madstena. In addition to these we may notice sugar-refining at Gothenburg, cutlery at Eskilstuna on Lake Malar, porcelain at Hoganas, and distilling, which is unfortunately too general, the Swedes being much addicted to spirit-drinking. The forests give employment in regard to charcoal, resin, potash, &c. Com merce is active, the exports being iron and steel, timber, minerals, potash, &c. ; and the imports, coal, wine, cotton, silk, colonial produce, and manufactured goods of all kinds. The commercial marine numbers 3236 vessels, with an aggregate capacity of 172,808 tons. Communications. \u2014 The ordiuary roads in Sweden are excellent. In addition to the Gotha Canal, already noticed in \u00a7 8, and which was com pleted in 1832, there are short canals leading from Lake Malar to the Baltic, to Dalecarlia, and to Lake Hjelmare. Railways connect Stock holm with Gothenburg and Jonkoping : lines are in progress in Gothland"], [360, "344 SWEDEN AND NORWAY. Book I. to communicate with Copenhagen from Malmoe and with Stralsund from Ystad ; and before long the two capitals, Christiania and Stockholm, will be connected by a line passing through Christinehamm on Lake Wenner. \u00a7 11. Political Divisions \u2014 Towns, &c. \u2014 Colonial Possessions. \u2014 For administrative purposes Sweden is divided into 24 provinces (lane), named (with the exception of the 5 most northerly) after their chief towns, and subdivided into 117 bailiwicks (f\u0153gderier). This division has not, however, superseded the old historical aLd territorial designations, according to which Sweden is divided into 3 great provinces, consisting of the once independent kingdoms of Gothland (Gotha Bike) in the S. and Sweden proper (Swea Mike) in the centre, and the subsequently acquired Norrland or North Land. These 3 are subdivided into 23 districts ; of which we may instance as current names, Dalecarlia, or more properly Dalarne, i.e. the valley district of the Dais, Dalecarlia itself being properly the designation of the people Dalkarlar ( = dale-churls) ; Smaland, in the centre of Gothland ; Schonen (Shane), in the extreme S. ; and Upland, between Lake Malar and the lower Dal. The towns are most numerous in the S. ; in the N. they are found only on the shores of the Gulf of Bothnia. They are generally built of wood, and it is only in the largest towDS that more costly materials are used. Stockholm, the capital, is beautifully situated on the channel connecting Lake Malar with the Baltic, the city proper on 3 islands in the channel, witb suburbs on the N. and S. banks of the channel : to its position it owes its name (Stock-holm = isle of piles) and the title accorded to it of the ' Northern Venice.' Gothenburg, the second town in point of population, stands at the confluence of the Gotha, and is very favourably situated for commerce with Great Britain : it is also actively engaged in manufactures. Fahlun is the capital of the chief mining district in Sweden. Norrko'ping, at the mouth of the Hotala, is a rising port, engaged in the export of iron and grain. Malmoe is the port for communication with Denmark and N.W. Germany Carlskrona is the seat of the Naval Arsenal of Sweden, founded in 1680 and named after Charles XI. ; it stands on several small islands, and has its docks hewn out of the solid granite. Upsala combines the characters of Canterbury and Oxford, as being the see of the Metropolitan and the seat of a University. Gefle is devoted to ship building. Most of the sea-port towns are strongly defended, Stock holm by fortresses on islands commanding the approach from the Baltic, particularly Waxholm ; Carlskrona by strong batteries ; and Gothenburg by the fortress of Elfsborg. In the interior the fortress of Wanas on Lake Wetter is the strongest in Sweden."], [361, "Chap. XV.

There are about 22,000 Finns and Lapps in Norway ; the former on the Swedish frontier, and the latter in Finland. The Norwegians are a fine athletic race, patriotic and hospitable, and particularly jealous of all encroach ments on the part of Sweden. The small resident freeholders are the most important social and political element in Norway : large estates are rare. The people are very tenacious of old customs, and retain pectdiar costumes in several districts, particularly in Telle marken, Bergen, and Hardanger. Government, Religion, and Education. \u2014 Norway, like Sweden, is a con stitutional monarchy. The nation acts through a parliament, named Storthing or \"great court,\" elected by a system of indirect voting. The Storthing, when met, selects out of its own body the Senate or Lag thing to form an upper chamber, comprising one-fourth of the whole number of representatives.

The power of the king in the house is limited to a suspensive veto : a bill which has passed the houses in 3 successive storthings becomes law without his assent. The esta blished religion is episcopal Lutheranism, and the country is divided into 5 bishoprics and 342 parishes, many of which are of great extent. Religious toleration has been legalized since 1844 (Mormonisni ex cepted), but the established church is almost universally followed. Education is very general, and there is a university at Christiania, established in 1811. Occupations. \u2014 Agriculture and fishing are the leading occupations in Norway. The cultivated ground is only about 1 per cent, of the area of the country, and of this the greater portion is under pasture. The best farming is in the southern provinces of Hedemarken and Smaalehnes. Barley and oats are the chief cereals ; rye and a little wheat are also grown, and a very large amount of potatoes. The grain is insufficient for the wants of the population. The farming methods are antiquated and unscientific. The farmers derive large pro fits from their timber, particularly in the valleys that converge towards the Christiania Fiord. Fishing is prosecuted along the whole coast. Manufacturing industry is at a low ebb : the absence of coal, and pru dent restrictions as to the demolition of the forests check the deve lopment of the mineral resources of the country, and leave the manufacturer mainly dependent on water as his motive power. Dis tilleries, breweries, and tobacco manufactories, with a few ironworks (the Fritzo near Laurvig in particular) are the chief establishments. Commerce is active : the exports are timber and deals, fish, and minerals; the imports, colonial produce, salt, coal, and Manchester goods. Communications. \u2014 The roads in Norway are good, considering the difficult character of the country : in some instances, as on the Chris tiania and Drontheim road N. of the Dovre Field, great engineering skill has been exercised. Railways have been made from the capital to the Swedish frontier near Kongsvinger, and to the lower end of Lake Miosen ; a line also connects the valleys of the Glommen and the Logen above Lake Miosen. Steamers ply on Miosen and round the coast. \u00a713. Political Divisions. \u2014 Towns, &c. \u2014 For administrative purposes Norway is divided into 17 provinces (dmter), which are subdivided into 45 bailiwicks (vogteien), and 66 sorenscriverien or \"sub-secretaryships.\" The political coincide with the main eccle siastical divisions, and hence the provinces are usually grouped under the 5 dioceses as follows : \u2014 The towns of Norway are few and poor : only 6 have populations of 10,000 and 4 of these are situated in the south, viz. : Christiania, Dioceses.

Bergen aud Drontheim are also in the southern moiety of the country, but more decidedly on the W. coast than Stavanger : they are historically the most interesting of the Nor wegian towns ; Drontheim, as the ancient capital before the annexa tion of Norway with Denmark, and the place where the kings are even yet crowned, and Bergen as the second in point of rank during the same period, and the first in commercial greatness down to quite recent times. Bergen is still the second town in population, and the chief seat of the stock-fish and fish-oil business. The naval arsenal of Norway is located at Horten, and there is a station and naval aca demy at Frederiksv\u0153rn, both places on the W. shore of the Christiania Fiord. Sarpsbsrg, on the E. side of the fiord, at the mouth of the Glommen, is rising into notice as a timber-port.

It attains its most southerly point (about 39\u00b0 N. lat.) in Trans- Caucasia between the Black and Caspian Seas, and its most northerly point in Siberia (North-East Cape, 77\u00b0 20' N. lat.), thus stretching through nearly 40 degrees of latitude. Its area is twice as large as the continent of Europe, and equals one-sixth of the whole"], [365, "Chap XVI. EXTENT AND POPULATION OF RUSSIA. 349 inhabited world. The latest returns give its extent as 7,867,094 sq. m. and its population as 76,029,818. These figures do not, however, include the late acquisitions in Central Asia ; and even in other parts they do but approximately represent the population, which is estimated to exceed eighty millions. It is somewhat diffi cult to apportion the above area between the two continents, inas much as the political divisions of Eussia do not coincide with the limits of Europe and Asia. The Empire is generally divided into 3 great portions : (1) Russia Proper, with Poland and Finland ; (2) Caucasia; and (3) Siberia. Of these, Eussia Proper includes the Trans-Uralic portions of Perm and Orenburg (54,782 sq. m. and 546,811 inhabitants), and Caucasia includes the Cis-Caucasian provinces, and thus falls partly in Europe and partly in Asia. Bear ing this in mind, the area and population of the several divisions are as follow : Historical Geography. \u2014 The Russian empire dates from 850, when Rurik consolidated numerous small states, with Novgorod for his capital. From 1210 to 1481 the country was subject to the Mongols, who added the provinces of Kiew and Volhynia to their possessions. The Mongols were expelled by Ivan the Great, originally the representative of a princely house seated at Moscow, but who ultimately became the ruler of all Russia. In 1552 the province of Kasan was wrested from the Mongols, in 1557 Astrakhan, and in 1582 Siberia. In 1613 the house of Romanoff came to the throne. In 1667 the provinces of Smolensk, Tchernigov, and Poltava were recovered from Poland, who had held them for some centuries; and in 1686 the city of Kiev, the province of Ekaterinoslav, and tbe eastern part of Kherson were also gained from the same state. Ingria (the present government of St. Petersburg), which had been lost to Sweden in 1617, was regained in 170ti, and ten years later Esthonia (Revel) and Livonia (Riga) were acquired from Sweden. By the first division of Poland (in 1772) Russia gained Vitebsk and Mohilev ; by the second (1793), Minsk, Kiev, and Eastern Volhynia ; and by the third (1795), Kovno, Vilna, Grodno, Courland, and western Volhynia. Meanwhile, in the S., Turkey had to yield in 1774 Asov, the Crimea, aud the territory be tween the Bug aud the Dnieper; and in 1792 Kherson. Within the present century the empire has been enlarged in Europe by the addi tion of the Swedish province of Finland in 1 809, the Turkish pro vince of Bessarabia in 1812, and the kingdom of Poland, first as an independent state with the Russian emperor for its sovereign in 1815, and finally as a subject province in 1831.

Boundaries, Area, and Population. \u2014 Influence of Posi tion. \u2014 Historical Geography of Poland. \u2014 The boundaries of Russia on the the W. and S.W. have been already noticed in describing the conterminous countries. From the mouth of the Tornea, which forms the limit N. of the Gulf of Bothnia, the boundary line is carried through the gulf so as to include the Aland Isles, and thence makes direct for the mouth of the Memel. On the side of Prussia, Austria, and Turkey the boundary is purely conventional, cutting the Niemen about 60 m. above its mouth, taking in the great easterly bend of the Vistula in its mid-course, cutting the upper courses of the Bug and the Dniester, and following the E. bank of the Pruth in its mid-course. In the N. the limit is fixed by the Arctic Ocean, and in the S. partly fixed by the Black Sea : in the S.E., Russia Proper (to the exclusion of Cis-Caucasia) is bounded by the Eva or Yega on the side of the Sea of Azov, the Kuma on the side of the Caspian, and Lake Manitch in the centre. In the E. European Russia is bounded by the Caspian Sea, the river Ural, and, in part, by the Ural Mts. The main divisions of European Russia are three : \u2014 (1) Russia Proper ; (2) the Kingdom of Poland ; and (3) the Grand-Duchy of Finland, the respective areas and populations of which are as follow : \u2014 NB.

HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY OF POLAND. 351 by no natural barriers, or by the occupation of the comparatively worth less and sparsely-populated regions of the north, on the other hand its too inland and northerly position has excluded Russia from ready com munication with the wealthiest and most influential regions of the world. The very extent of its area renders it practically secure frcm military invasion ; but its naval power is cramped and fettered by the absence of an open sea-board. The sparseness of its population pro bably favours the action of the strong Imperialism to which Russia owes so much of its greatness ; but this sparseness also checks manufacturing and commercial enterprise. Its easterly position has constituted Russia the patron and protector of the Greek Church, and has furnished it with a pretext for interfering with the Christian popu lation of the Turkish, and even with some portions of the Austrian Empires ; but its zeal, backed as it is supposed to be by ambitious projects for the extension of its empire to the shores of the Medi terranean, exposes it to the jealous suspicions of the great Latin powers as well as of the commercial nations of western Europe. Historical Geography of Poland. \u2014 Down to the middle of the 1 7th century Poland ranked among the most powerful states of Europe, and occupied a central and compact territory, the area of which (including the vassal states) is estimated at not far short of 480,000 sq. m., on which there is now a population amounting to above thirty-three millions. The kingdom was then composed of three great divisions \u2014 Great Poland, Little Poland, and Lithuania, corresponding in general terms to the N.W., S., and N.E. quarters. Great Poland embraced those portions which have since been acquired by Prussia, as already detailed : Little Poland included Austrian Galicia, together with Little Russia or the Ukraine, and the S. part of West Russia (Volhynia, Podolia), both which had been conquered in 1320 by the Dukes of Lithuania, and had passed over in 1386 to Poland on the conquest of Lithuania : Lithuania comprised not only Lithuania proper (Vilna, Grodno, and Kovno), but also Lithuanian Russia, comprising the remainder of West Russia (Minsk, Mohilev, aud Vitebsk), and even portions of Great Russia, viz. Smolensk, Kursk, and Orel, included under the old title of Severia, which thus brought the Polish frontier very near to Moscow. At the same period Courland and Livonia were fiefs of Poland, so that in the N. the boundary extended nearly to the Gulf of Finland. Previously to the successive partitions of 1772, 1793, and 1795, Russia had regained the Great Russian provinces, and a considerable portion of the Ukraine ; and Livonia had been acquired in 1660 by Sweden. In the partitions Russia gained the greatest share, about 128,000 sq. m., while Prussia gained about 52,000, and Austria about 48,000 sq. m. In 1815 the remainder of Poland was constituted an independent monarchy with the Russian Czar as its king: the rebellion of 1831 led to its being deprived of much of its independence, and that of 1863 has finally Bealed its national extinction. The fate of Cracow has already been noticed in connection with Austria. \u00a7 3. Coast-line, Harbours, and Islands. \u2014 Russia possesses a sea hoard on the Baltic, the Black Sea, and the Arctic Ocean. The two first are inclosed seas, the outlets from which are not under her con trol, and the third is virtually of the same character, inasmuch as it is ice-bound for 8 out of the 12 months. On the Baltic, Russia"], [368, "RUSSIA. Book I. 352 possesses the E. coast from the Prussian frontier near Memel to the head of the Gulf of Bothnia; on the Arctic Ocean, all that lies E. of the Varan<rer Fiord; and on the Black Sea, the whole of the N. and about half of the E. coast. Of these, and of the leading ports on each, we add some particulars. (1.) The most important portion of the Baltic is the Gulf of Finland, which belongs exclusively to Russia : the S. coast is rock-bound and fringed with islets between Port Baltic and Narva Bay, and flat thence to the Neva : the N. coast is high and rocky, fretted with inlets, and fringed with islets as far E. as Viborg. The chief port on this gulf is Kronstadt, on an island 18 m. distant from St. Petersburg, a place which nature and art have combined to render impregnable : the island is encircled by sandbanks and shallow water everywhere except on its Bouth side, where a passage, narrowed by a sandbank from the opposite coast, gives access to the Neva: the town stands at the S.E. angle of the island and contains 3 harbours, one for mercantile and two for naval purposes, the approaches to which are protected by case mated batteries of the strongest description. On the N. or Finnish coast there is a fine harbour at Helsingfors, which is secured by the impregnable fortress of Sveaborg, situated on 7 islands in front of the port, and regarded as the 'Gibraltar' of the Baltic: Helsingfors is the station of the Russian island (skdren) flotilla. On the S. side of the gulf is the fortified port of Revel, sheltered in front by islands. S. of the Gulf of Finland the coast is low and sandy ; it opens into the extensive Bay of Riga, the entrance to which is partly closed by the islands Oesel and Dago, and which possesses ports at Pernau and Riga, neither of great capacity, inasmuch as large vessels are obliged to unload in the roadsteads. The E. coast of the Gulf of Bothnia is high and rugged with numberless islets (skdren), to which the Aland Islands, at the entrance of the gulf, form a kind of advanced post in the direction of Sweden, distant only 20 m. (2.) The Arctic coast is varied by the intrusion of the irregularly shaped White Sea with its 3 gulfs \u2014 Kandalaksha in the N.W., Onega in the S., and Archangel in the S.E., the latter containing the only port of importance in Northern Russia, viz. Archangel, at the mouth of the Dwina, the emporium for the export of the raw produce of the north, and the oldest port in Russia. At the entrance of Onega Bay are the Solovetskoy islands, with a far-famed monastery founded in 1429 and visited as a place of pilgrimage. E. of the White Sea we may notice the island, virtually a peninsula (for the dividing channel is very narrow) of Kaninskaia ; the Tcheskaia Gulf; the estuary of the Petchora; and the dreary double isle of Novaia Zemlia ( = ' New-land') which may be regarded as a continuation of the Ural chain, the isle of Waigatz forming the connecting link. (3.) The most valuable portion of the Black Sea coast is the northern section as far E. as Anapa at the foot of Caucasus. The distinguishing features here are (1) the limans or shallow sedgy gulfs at the outlets of the great rivers, rendering them unavailable for large vessels ; and (2) the kosas or long tongues of land running out from the coast. The southerly projection of the Crimea and the northerly projection of the Sea of Azov render this coast very irregular: the Crimea is con nected with the mainland by the Isthmus of Perekop which is narrowed on the W. by the Gulf of Perekop, and on the E. by the Siwash or"], [369, "Chap. XVI. COAST-LINE, HARBOURS, ETC. 353 Putrid Sea, a very peculiar sheet, or rather series of sheets, of shallow sedgy water connected with the Sea of Azov by the Strait of Ghenitchi, and separated more to the S. from that sea by the long 7.osa or tongue of Arabat, which furnishes a second route to the peninsula. The Sea of Azov terminates N.E. in the Gulf of Taganrog. The chief com mercial port on the Black Sea is Odessa, ou a fine bay midway between the Dnieper and the Dniester, founded in 1794 and having an arti ficial harbour formed by two moles. Nikolaiev, at the confluence of the Bug and Dnieper, was founded in 1790 as a naval port, but is dis used for that purpose since the peace of Paris. Kertch, on the Strait of Yenikale, may be regarded as the deep-sea port of the Sea of Azov Taganrog, whioti is the chief emporium for the commerce of the Don, has become too shallow for ships of burthen.

Configuration \u2014 Mountains and Plateaus. \u2014 Russia occu pies the whole expanse of the Sarmatian Plain from the Vistula to the Ural Mts., and from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea. The only extensive mountain range in the country is the Ural, which separates the Sarmatian from the Siberian plain, and of which some particulars are given below, as also of the isolated and less important range of the Yailas in the S. of Crimea. The Sarmatian plain exhibits considerable variations of elevation, resulting however rather from broad-backed swells or belts than from mountains. The most important of these elevated regions are the two already noticed in chap. I. \u00a7 9, under the names of the TJralo-Baltio and Uralo-Carpathian, and to these we may add a third, of equal extent"], [370, "RUSSIA. Book I. 354 but of less importance in the physical geography of the country, viz. the Finland or Olonetz plateau between the Gulf of Bothnia and the \"White Sea. The Uralo-Baltic or northern line falls into two sections a western, consisting of detached masses separated by the depres sions alon\" which the rivers Niemen, Diina, and Msta hold their way; and an eastern, consisting of a low, narrow, and continuous ridce, on which lies the watershed between the basin of the Volga and the rivers that flow to the Arctic Ocean. Of the detached masses in the western section the most noteworthy is the dome shaped swell of the Valdai Heights, situated S. of Lake Rmen, which attains in Popowa Gora an elevation of 934 ft.: it is an important point in the hydrography of Russia as marking the limit between the basins of the Caspian and the Baltic. The eastern section is covered with forests and is occasionally designated the Uwalli. The Uralo-Carpathian or southern belt is a broad and moderately ele vated mass, commencing in the E. at the bank of the Volga and stretching right across to the Carpathians, occasionally interrupted by the great rivers, which force their way through it with deeply cut beds, rocky bottoms, and frequent rapids. The distinctive feature of the Olonetz plateau is the number of lakes strewed over it: it attains a maximum elevation of 1094 ft. in Teiri-Harju, situ ated in 64\u00b0 41' N. lat. Extensive steppes occupy the S.E. portion of the plain between the rivers Dnieper and Ural. The Ural Mountains. \u2014 The Ural range has a length of about 1300 m., bet ' en the Strait of Waigatz on the Arctic Ocean and the westerly bend of the river Ural in the S. It is usually divided into 3 sections, \u2014 the Northern, Central, and Southern ; otherwise described according to their general character, as the Barren, the Mineral, and the Woody Urals, the Central or Mineral Ural being situated between 55^\u00b0 and 61\u00b0 N. lat. The range is generally broad and plateau-like, with extensive swamps on its summits. The highest points of the range are Toll-Poes '5540 ft.) in 63\u00b0 47', Konjakofsky (5397 ft.) in 59\u00b0 50', and Iremel (5040 ft.) in 54\u00b0 30' N. lat. The extreme N. portion of the range is designated the Obdorsk Mts. At its S. extremity the range breaks up into several lines of elevation, one of which, under the name ofthe Obstchei-Sirt, proceeds W. to the Volga and forms a connecting link between the Urals and the Uralo-Carpathian plateau. We have finally to notice a line of high ground which leaves the Ural in about 61J\u00b0 N. lat., and proceeds N.W., under the name of Timan, between the rivers Petchora and Mezen. The Crimea. \u2014 The southern part of the Crimea is remarkable for the contrast it affords in scenery and climate not only to the other parts of the peninsula but to the whole of European Russia. While the northern and central regions of the Crimea are occupied by steppes with their usual characteristics of salt-lakes, exposed pasture-grounds, and parching climate, the south coast is fringed with a belt of mountains containing well-watered and wooded valleys, with rich pastures, gardens, and vine yards. The ground rises to the S. in a series of parallel chains, and descends precipitously to the coast of the Black Sea. The highest"], [371, "Chap. XVI. HYDROGRAPHY. 355 summit is Tchatir-Dagh (5135 ft.). The climate of this region is favourably affected by the shelter of the mountain-ranges, and, com bined with the pleasing scenery, renders it one of the most attractive parts of Russia. \u00a7 5. Hydrography. \u2014 Rivers, Lakes, and Canals. \u2014 The Sar matian Plain has a double slope \u2014 S.E. to the Caspian and Black Seas, and N.W. to the Baltic and the Arctic Ocean. The former is by far the most extensive, reaching as high as 61\u00b0 N. lat. on the side of the Urals, and thence bounded by a line crossing diagonally to about 49\u00b0 N. lat. on the side of the Carpathians, along the line of the Uwalli and the Valdai heights. Each slope has two subordinate divisions ; the south-eastern into the basins of the Caspian and the Black Sea ; the north-western into those of the Arctic Ocean (with the White Sea) and the Baltic. The four basins converge towards the Valdai Heights ; the Caspian being represented by the Volga, tho Black Sea by the Dnieper, the Baltic by the Diina and the Msta, and the White Sea by the more remote Suchona or Western Dwina. The convergence of the Kama (a branch of the Volga) and the Petchora, which flows into the Arctic Ocean, is also to be noted. The facilities thus afforded for an extensive system of canalization are illustrated by the map on p. 358. The influence of the southern line of plateau is observable in the diversion of the courses of the Don and Dnieper to the S.E. as they pass through it, and in the barrier it places between the Don and the Volga at the point of their closest approximation. The lakes of Russia present on a small scale the characteristic features of the North- American lakes, in that they are connected by watercourses and form a system. This is most observable in respect to the great lakes, Ladoga and Onega, which with the lesser ones of Saima and Ilmen have a common outlet by the Neva, as the North- American lakes have by the St. Lawrence. A similar though less important system may be noticed in the lakes of Finland. The lengths and areas of the river-basins have been already given in chap. I. \u00a7 11 : we now append some descriptive particulars of the rivers, arranged under the titles of the seas which serve as their receptacles. (I.) Rivers of tlie Caspian Sea. \u2014 The Volga rises on the Valdai heights at an elevation of 800 ft. above the Baltic, flows N.E. to the confluence of the Mologa, S.E. to the confluence of the Kama, S.W. to the junction of the Sarpa, and finally S.E. across the steppes to the Caspian which it enters by 65 mouths. It receives on its 1. bank, the Tvertza (of Tver), the Mologa, the Cheksna. a little below the Mologa, issuing from Lake Bie'lo, and the Kama, the most important of all the Volga tributaries, if not indeed more important than the Volga itself, rising in the Urals and running parallel to the chain, intercepting the streams that flow from it. Affluents on the rt. \u2014 the Oka, an important stream which joins it at Nischnei-Novgorod and receives the Moskva (of Moscow), aud the Sura, which joins it above the Kama. The Volga is navigable"], [372, "356 RUSSIA. Book I, for vessels up to the confluence of the Cheksna, and for barges to Tver, where it is 700 ft. broad : below Kasan it is above luOO yards broad, and above its delta it overflows its banks to the extent of 10 m. The banks are high between its source and Zubztov, and between Saratov and Sarepta. The mouths of the Caspian were formerly unnavigable for vessels in consequence of sandbanks : three channels are now kept clear by the Russian Government, and about 300 steamers ply on the river. The amount of fish in the lower Volga is prodigious : it is to this that the Tartar name of Ethel ' the bountiful ' is attributed. The TJral, which forms the boundary between Europe and Asia, rises on the E. or Siberian side of the Ural Mts., and flows S. to Orsk, W. to Uralsk, and S. to the Caspian : it is navigable for boats to Verknii Uralsk and for barges to Orsk : like the Volga, it is well stocked with fish. (2.) Rivers of the. Black Sea. \u2014 The Dnieper rises on the plateau of Valdai, and flows S.W. to Orcha, S. to Kiev, S.E. to Ekaterinoslav, and then S. and S.W. to the Black Sea: receiving in its course, rt. the Beresina, which flows through a densely wooded and marshy region with a rapid course ; the Pripet, which traverses the vast marshes of Pinsk, and receives the drainage of Volhynia ; and the southern Bug, which traverses Podolia and joins it near the Black Sea: the Desna is the only important affluent on its 1. bank. The navigation of the Dnieper is interrupted by a series of rapids below Ekaterinoslav, at the point where it leaves the Uralo-Carpathian plateau ; above these falls to near Kiev the banks are high. The Don rises in Central Russia in close proximity to the basin of the Oka, with a branch of which (the Chat) it is connected by a canal: it flows S.E. until it meets the heights which separate it from tha Volga : by these it is diverted sharply to the S.W. across interminable plains, which it inundates in the spring, to the Sea of Azov, which it enters by three shallow channels ; its only important affluent is the Donetz, traversing the Ukraine, on its right bank. The Dniester in its upper course belongs to the Austrian province of Galicia : between Mohilev and Dubossary it breaks through the Uralo-Carpathian plateau with a rapid and rocky stream, and after crossing the steppe terminates is a shallow liman : small vessels occa sionally .reach Bender. (3.) Rivers of the Baltic. \u2014 The Dona or Southern Dwina has its sources in the small lakes and marshes on the E. side of the Valdai plateau, and flows S. to the confluence of the Ula, skirting the foot of the Uralo-Baltic ridge ; it then turns N.W., penetrates the ridge between high banks aud with a rocky bed, and crosses a low swampy plain to the Gulf of Riga. The Narva carries off to the Gulf of Finland the surplus waters of Lake Peipus, which is fed by several rivers and principally by the Velika, which enters it at its southern division, the Lake of Pskov: the Narva has two falls shortly before reaching the sea. The Neva is the outlet for the large lake system of Russia : it issues from Ladoga, which is the common receptacle of the waters of Lake Onega by the Swir, of Lake Saima by the Woxen, and of Lake Ilmen by the Volkhov : Lake Ladoga further receives the Sias from tha S. The Neva itself is only 40 m. long, but is very deep and about 500 yards wide. Onega receives the Vodla from the E. and the Vytegra from the S., which approximates to the Kovsha, a tributary of the Volga, through Lake Bie'loe. Lake Ilmen receives the Msta, which approximates to the Tvertza branch of the Volga."], [373, "Chap. XVI. HYDROGRAPHY. 357 (4.) Rivers ofthe Arctic Ocean. \u2014 The Dwina is formed of two great arms : the Suchona from the W., which rises uear Vologda on the Uwallis, and the Vytchegda from the E. ; these unite about 62\u00b0 N. lat. and 46 j\u00b0 E. long., aud the Dwina thence flows N.W. by Archangel to the White Sea, whicli it enters by five principal mouths. The Onega, W. of the Dwina. rises in Lake Latcha and flows N. to the Onega Bay of the White Sea. The Mezen, E. of the Dwina, joins the sea just at the entrance of the White Sea. The Petchora rises on the Ural Mts. and receives numerous tributaries from the Ub dorsk chain in its passage across the dreary Tundras to the White Sea. Lukes. \u2014 The following particulars apply to the lakes above mentioned in connection with the rivers : \u2014 The characteristic features of these lakes are as follow : \u2014 Ladoga, low shores, unequal depth, numerous islands, violent storms. Onega, rocky aud indented shores, numerous islands, frequent shallows. Peipus, deep, marshy wooded shores, fish abundant. Pskov, connected with Peipus by a broad chaunel, and sometimes regarded as a part of Peipus. Saima, very irregular in shape, numerous islands. Canals. \u2014 Of the various canals which connect the Russian rivers the most important is the Vishnei-Volotchok between the Msta and the Tvertza, constructed by Peter the Great, by means of which the Caspian and Baltic seas are united and through which 2000 vessels pass in the course of the year. From the Msta the Volkhov is reached by the Novgorod canal which circumvents the N. shore of Lake Ilmen. The Volga is again united to Lake Ladoga by the Tikhvin canal between the Mologa aud the Tikhvina, a branch of the Sias ; and to Lake Onega by the Marie canal between the Kovsha which flows into Lake Bieloe and the Vytegra which flows into Onega. Lakes Onega and Ladoga are connected by the river Svir, and in order to avoid the dangers of the lakes themselves, canals have been carried along their S. coasts, viz. : the Onega canal between the Vytegra aud the Svir ; the Svir canal between the Svir and the Sias ; and the Ladoga canal between the Volkhov and the Neva. There are thus three Hues connecting the Volga with the Baltic. The White Sea is connected with both of these by the Koubinskoe canal whicb joins the Cheksna and the Suchona. Canals further join the Moskva and the Volga, the Vytchegda and the Kama, the Duna and the Dnieper, and the Kiemen and the Dnieper. \u00a7 6.

Four zones may be distinguished : \u2014 (1) The Arctic zone within the Arctic Circle, where the rivers are frozen for about nine months ; a region of mosses and dwarf shrubs. (2) The Cold zone, between the Arctic circle and the 57th parallel, in which the rivers are frozen for about six months and the temperature varies from a mean of 39\u00b06 at St. Petersburg to 33\u00b0 at Archangel ; a region of vast forests of pine and birch, and producing the hardier cereals, rye, oats, and barley, in increasing quantities from N. to S. (3) The Temperate zone, between the 57th and 50th parallels, with a temperature averaging 40\u00b0 at Moscow and 44\u00b0 at Warsaw ; the region of the lime-tree, and of wheat, hemp, and millet. (4) The Warm zone, south of 50\u00b0, which still has an excessively cold winter (the mean winter temperature at Astrakhan being only 13\u00b0), but also an excessively hot summer, the mean temperature being about 45j\u00b0 ; a region of steppes, with occasional bottom-lands in which maize ripens, and with a summer heat sufficiently great to ripen the vine in the Crimea, The richest parts 'of Eussia are the mid-basin of the Volga and the Ukraine (Kharkov, Poltava, Kiev, and Tchernigov) : the most barren and dreary portions are the"], [375, "Chap XVI. INHABITANTS, GOVERNMENT, ETC. 359 extreme northern region and the vast swamps between the Pripet and the Niemen. Timber is abundant (occupying 31 per cent, of the whole surface), but it is unequally distributed-: there are great forests both in the W. (the forest of Bialoviza, about the sources of the Narew covers above 500 sq. m. and still shelters the urus) and in the E., on the Uwalli heights, and in the angle S. of them to the Urals : in the central and southern provinces wood is scarce. The mineral wealth of Eussia is great and varied : the Urals yield gold (chiefly on their K slope, at Berezov near Ekaterinburg, and at Neviansk more N. in Penn), copper, iron, platinum, malachite, and salt. Salt is also obtained along the Uwalli ridge and from many of the steppe lakes, especially Lake Elton in Astrakhan. A small amount (800,000 tons) of coal, of inferior quality, is raised betweeD the Dnieper and Don. Fine granite is found about the great lakes, and supplies St. Petersburg with building material. Fish are an important product of Southern Eussia : caviar, obtained from the roe of the sturgeon and the beluga of the Caspian rivers, is the greatest luxury of the country. \u00a77. Inhabitants. \u2014 Government, Eeligion, and Education. \u2014 Occupations. \u2014 Communications. \u2014 Although Eussia contains within its limits a greater number of races than any other European state, yet there is so large a preponderance of Slavonians and, among the Slavonians, of Bussians proper, that the population may be pro nounced to be fairly homogeneous. The Eussians proper number 49 millions, compactly situated in the heart of the country : they fall into two great divisions speaking different forms of the Eussan language, viz. the Great Eussians of the central districts, and the Little Eussians of the Ukraine ; to which a third but less influ ential division may be added, consisting of the White Bussians in West Bussia. The other great branch of the Slavonian family is the Polish, which is not only dominant in Poland but numbers some 6| millions in the western provinces of Bussia (Volhynia, Grodno, Podolia, and Lithuania). Of the other races we may specify (1) the Lithuanians proper (about lj million) who use a language of great interest to philologers on account of its close approximation to Sanskrit; (2) the Finnish or Tchudic tribes, including the Finns (about lj- million) of Finland; the Esthes and Lives, S. of the Gulf of Finland, who use the same language as the Finns ; the Lapps, and the Samoiedes, living on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, respec tively W. and E. of the White Sea ; and various tribes in the Ural region ; (3) the Tartar tribes, who are numerous in the S.E., including the Tartars of Kazan, the Nogai of the Crimea, and the Bashkirs of the Ural Mts. The Finnish and Tartar races are not members of the Indo-European family. We may further mention that Germans have been settled in the Baltic provinces ever since the period"], [376, "360 RUSSIA. Book I. when these were subject to the German order of Swordbrothers (1200-1500), and that Swedes hold an influential place in Finland. Jews are very numerous in Poland, which is hence termed the ' Jews' Paradise.' The Cossacks of the S. are regarded as a branch of the Little Eussians intermingled with various foreign elements. The character of the Bussians proper has been probably much modified by the institutions of the country : down to 1863 the bulk of the population were serfs, and a sharp line of division separated the lower from the upper class or nobles (under which term are included not only hereditary nobles but all persons holding government offices such as civil and military officers, clergy, teachers, lawyers, &c). The Eussian peasant is lighthearted, domestic, handy, sturdy, and con spicuous for docility, which exhibits itself in the forms of extreme reverence for the Emperor, servility of manner, and religious venera tion. The ordinary dress is made of.sheepskin, and the houses are heated with large stoves, on which the beds are laid. The educated classes are distinguished for their extreme aptitude in acquiring foreign languages, and for general versatility. The Eussian states man is remarkably skilful in diplomacy, and all classes seem to be equally open to the charge of venality. The distribution of the population is very unequal; the most densely populated districts are (1) the manufacturing provinces surrounding Moscow, in some of which there are about 100 souls to the square mile, (2) the agricultural provinces of the Ukraine, with Kursk and Podolia, which have even a higher average than that just mentioned ; and (3) Poland. The thinnest districts are the three northern provinces, which, with an area of above 500,000 sq. m., have only a million and a half of inhabitants : East Eussia is also scantily tenanted. The mean density is about 32 to the sq. m. Government. \u2014 Russia is an absolute hereditary monarchy ; all power, legislative and executive, being vested absolutely in the Emperor,1 on the condition of his being a member of the orthodox Greek Church, of which he is the semi-sacerdotal head. The Emperor is aided in all matters that come under his immediate cognizance by a Privy Council, and in the general administration of affairs by four great councils, one of which, the Holy Synod, superintends the religious department, a second consists of the Ministers, and the two remaining ones, entitled the Council of the Empire and the Senate, exercise the highest deliberative and judicial functions. The provinces are superintended by governors, and the local affairs of parishes and districts by officers elected by the residents of the villages. The nobles possess the right \u2022 The emperor is styled the Czar of all the Bussias. In addition to Great Russia and Little Russia (a distinction which ap- patently arose at the time \u00abhen the latter was subject to Poland), there were three other old divisions, viz.: White Russia, which included Vitepsk, Mohilev, and the greater part of Minsk; Black Eussia, of which Novogrudek in the W of Minsk was the capital; and Bed Russia, the greater part of which is included tn Aus trial, Galicia, and the remaind.-r in tie S.E. angle ol Poland"], [377, "Chap. XVI. RELIGION \u2014 AGRICULTURE. 361 of meeting in provincial diets, and have hitherto exercised very con siderable influence on the public opinion of the country. Finland has a constitution of its own, and is attached to Russia only by a personal union : its parliament or senate meets at Helsingfors, aud it has distinct military and naval forces. Religion and Education. \u2014 Russia is the head-quarters of the orthodox Greek Church, which numbers nearly 60 millions of adherents in the country. Other forms of religion are tolerated, and the Roman- Catholic Church is largely predominant in the governments of Kovno and Vilna, and particularly in Poland, where it numbers about four fifths of the population. In the Baltic provinces and Finland the Lutheran Church is in the ascendant. The remaining population is divided between Mohammedans (2 J millions), Jews (lj million), Schismatical Greeks (f of a million), Catholic Armenians, and pagans.' The Greek Church retains the Old Style of calendar, which is univer sally adopted in Russia. Education is advancing under the strenuous efforts of the Government, but is still far behind the general European standard. There are Universities at Moscow (founded 1775;, St. Petersburg (1819), Kasan (1804), Kharkov (1803), Dorpat (1632) 'Kief (1831), and Helsingfors (1827) for Finland. Agriculture. \u2014 Agriculture is the leading pursuit in Russia, and the capacities of the country in this respect are of a high order, but are very partially developed in consequence of the antiquated system of husbandry in vogue. The Baltic provinces are the most forward in farming, and obtain good crops of wheat, potatoes, flax, and hemp, together with green crops for cattle-feeding. The provinces of the Ukraine produce a vast amount of wheat, which is shipped at Odessa for England. Tobacco and beet-root are also grown in this region and in some parts of the Volga basin. Fruit is of importance in Bessarabia and the Crimea. Live stock holds a high place in the agricultural resources of Russia, particularly in the steppe districts of the south for horses, cattle, and sheep, and in the western provinces for cattle. Bee-keeping is a favourite pursuit in many parts, and the silk-worm is cultivated in the southern provinces. Manufactures. \u2014 The Russian Government has done everything in its power to foster manufacturing industry, and has tolerably well suc ceeded in producing an equilibrium between the home demand and supply. But Russia can never become a great manufacturing country for the world at large : coal is deficient, the population is too sparse, and the genius of the people is rather for imitation than for inven tion. The leading manufacture in Russia is connected with its staple products of flax and hemp, which are worked up into linen, sail cloth, cordage, &c, the chief seat of the hnen business being in the provinces surrounding Moscow. Cotton and woollen textures are largely produced in the same district, as well as in the great towns in other parts of the empire. The amount of iron produced in Russia is comparatively small (about 250,000 tons), but the forms into which it is worked up (hardware, cutlery, military weapons, &c.) furnish one of the leading and most successful branches of industry. The pro vinces of Nijni-Novgorod, Riazan, Viatka, and Perm are the chief seats of the iron-manufacture, and there are important cutlery and arm establishments in other quarters, particularly in Tula. The production of ornamental glass has been successfully studied at St. Petersburg, Tula, and Tver; and Russia holds a high place in this respect. Leather work (russia and morocco for bookbinding) is another leading business. mod. geo. R"], [378, "Book I. 362 RUSSIA. Sugar-making (from beet-root\"), distilling, chandlery, porcelain, &c, jnay be also mentioned, together with the ornamental furniture of malachite and other stones, which may be regarded as a specialty of Kussia. Commerce.\u2014 Commerce gives employment to a great number of people in consequence of the distances that goods have to be conveyed. The internal business is transacted at large fairs, such as those at Nijni- Novgorod, Berditchev, and Kursk in Russia, and Lublin in Poland. Heavy goods are conveyed by river from point to point. The foreign trade is prosecuted with Asia by means of caravans, which start chiefly from Orenburg for Central Asia, and from Perm for Siberia; and with Western Europe by sea from the ports of the Baltic and Black Seas, and from Archangel : the exports are almost entirely raw materials, \u2014 hides, bristles, hemp, flax, wheat, tallow, timber, potash, furs, &c. : the imports are cotton and silk (raw and manufactured), machinery, dyes, wine, tea very largely from China by an overland route, aud fruits. Communications. \u2014 The elaborate system of internal navigation in Russia has been already sufficiently noticed. Railways are completed from St. Petersburg S.E. to Moscow, and thence on to Nijni-Novgorod in one direction, and Kozlov in another : from St. Petersburg to Warsaw and Cracow with branches from Vilna to Kiinigsberg, and from Dunaburg N.W. to Riga and S.E. to Polotsk (whence it wdl be carried to Vitepsk) : and from Odessa to Balta in Podolia, with a branch to the Dniester opposite Bender. About 1400 m. are now open. The great highroads in Russia are excellent, but the cross-roads are little better than tracks. \u00a78. Political Divisions. \u2014 For administrative purposes, Eussia (exclusive of Poland and Finland) is divided into 50 governments, named for the most part after their capitals ; the exceptions being (1) \u2022 the Baltic provinces, three of which retain their old historical titles of Esthonia, Livonia, and Courland, while Ingria (the fourth) has been partially superseded by the name of the capital ; (2) Olonetz, whose old capital of the same name has been superseded by the modern Petrozavodsk ; (3) the southern governments of Bessarabia and Taurida (the latter of which is derived from the ancient name of the Crimea, Taurica Chersonesus) ; and (4) the old Polish districts of Podolia and Volhynia. The fifty governments may be conveniently grouped under the following seven heads, corresponding to ethno- logical and partly to geographical distinctions: \u2014 (1) the four Baltic provinces, occupied by a mixed population of Finnish, Lettish, and German extraction. (2) Great1 Bussia (19 provinces) in the centre and north, occupied by Eussians proper. (3) East Bussia (5 provinces), in which there is a large admixture of Finnish (Tschudic) and Tartar elements. (4) The Czardom of Astrakhan (5 provinces), in the S.E., corresponding in the main with the old Khanate of that name and having a mixed Tartar population. (5) 1 Great Russia admits of a subdivision on an historical basis into (1) the Nov gorod provinces, between the great lakes and the upper Volga ; (2) the old Mus covite provinces, between the Oka and the Don; and (3) the Smolensk provinces, about the upper Dnieper ; tbe remainder being included under the title of North Russia"], [379, "363 Chap. XVI. POLITICAL DIVISIONS. Little Bussia (4 provinces), between the Dnieper and Donetz, occupied by a branch of the Eussians proper, and coinciding very nearly with the old border territory of the Ukraine ( = ' border '), the original seat 0/ the Cossacks. (6) South or New Bussia (5 provinces), including the former Turkish Bessarabia and the steppes occupied by nomad Tartars which formed the Khanate of the Crimea or Krim Tartary. And (7) West or Polish Bussia (8 provinces), occupied in the W. by Poles, in the E. by Busniaks or Buthenians. The Kingdom of Poland is now subdivided into 8 governments, named after the towns, Warsaw, Lodz, Plotzk, Eadom, Augustovo, Kalisch, Kielce, and Siedlec ; and the Archduchy of Finland into 8 provinces. The old district of Carelia on Lake Ladoga now forms the province of Viborg. We append a list of the divisions and Eussian provinces with the principal towns in each. IS 2 Divisions and Governments.

Bussia may be said to possess two capitals, St. Petersburg, the seat of government, founded by Peter the Great, in 1793, in a position which he deemed suitable to the commercial and territorial aggrandizement of the modern empire in its relations to Western Europe ; and Moscow, the representative of the old semi-Asiatic empire in regard both to its interior position and its historical and ecclesiastical traditions. Both are very large and populous towns, \u2014 St. Petersburg having a circuit of about 20 m., and Moscow of 25J m. , the area in each casa containing a great extent of unoccupied ground in the form of squares, gardens, &c. The site of St. Petersburg is rendered picturesque by the windings and ramifications of the Neva, which here divides into several arms \u2014 the great and little Nevas, the great and little Nevkas \u2014 enclosing islands. The town is chiefly built on the 1. bank of the river, but extends over the islands, which are united by numerous bridges of boats. The streets are regular and broad (the Nevskoi Prospect above 2\u00a3 m. long and 130 ft. wide); the palaces and public buildings are grand and massive. Moscow stands chiefly on the 1. bank of the river after which it is named, and is built with streets radiating from the Kremlin as their central point, and connected with each other by cross streets, which assume the ap pearance of gradually enlarging circles. Warsaw, the old capital of"], [382, "366 RUSSIA Book I Poland, stands on the 1. bank of the Vistula, and, though fallen from its former greatness, is still the third city in the empire. The only other town with a population exceeding 100,000 is Odessa (founded in 1792), the great commercial emporium for the Black Sea and Danube traffic. Of the 11 remaining cities that have above 50,000 inhabitants, only two belong to the region of the Baltic, viz. the commercial port of Bjga, on the Diina, and Vilna, on a branch of the Niemen, an ancient but somewhat fallen town ; two are situated in the centre, viz. Tula, already noticed as the seat of large manufactures, and Kasan, which has the double character of an educational and a commercial town, being favourably situated at the southern bend of the Volga, as an entrepfit both for the river traffic and for foreign trade with northern Asia ; the remaining 7 towns are located in the regions of the Black Sea and the Caspian, and are for the most part commercial towns \u2014 Kishenau, on the Dniester, the capital of Bes sarabia; Nikolaiev, on the Bug, formerly the naval station for the Black Sea ; Berditchev, between the Dniester and Dnieper, with great fairs ; Kiev, on the Dnieper, the \" holy city \" of Bussia, a most ancient and interesting place, once the capital of Bussia, and then possessing 400 churches, now an educational and commercial town, and recovering somewhat of its early importance ; Kharkov, between the Dnieper and the Don ; Saratov, an entrepot on the Volga ; and Astrakhan, the great port of the Caspian. We may further briefly notice Nijni-Novgorod, at the confluence of the Oka and Volga, with its great annual fair ; Kursk, on a branch of the Dnieper, the seat of another great fair ; Voronetz, the emporium of the upper Don ; Jaroslav and Simbirsk, important provincial capitals, on the upper and middle Volga, and the ports of Kronstadt, Eevel, and Archangel, already noticed in \u00a7 3. Many of the towns in the western provinces are strongly fortified, partly with a view to repress the Poles and partly for external warfare. Thus in Poland itself we may specify, in addition to Warsaw, the following fortresses : \u2014 Modlin, at the con fluence of the Bug and Vistula ; Sierosk, at the confluence of the Narew and Bug ; lomza, higher up the Narew ; Kalisch, on the Prosna ; and Zamoz, on the Wieprz, in the S.E. The last-mentioned guards the Galician frontier and there is a strong modern fortress at Lutzk in Volhynia for the same purpose. The Eussian frontier is guarded by Bobruisk on the Beresina, Brzeso Litovski on the northern Bug, and Smolensk, which guards the opening between the Dnieper and the Diina, designated the \" Gate of Eussia.\" Noteworthy Objects.\u2014 St. Petersburg, St. Isaac's Church (1858), ofthe most costly materials, the 4 porticoes sustained by 48 monolithic columns of granite 56 ft. long, the walls cased inside and outside with marble, surmounted by a dome and 1 bell-towers ; the Cathedral of our Lady of Kazan (1814), on the model of St. Peter's at Rome, with a fine semi-circular colonnade ; the Winter Palace, restored after the"], [383, "Chap.

Russia claims a sovereignty over them. They consist of 3 large and several smaller islands, with an aggregate area of 22,850 sq. m. The surface is covered with snow-clad mountains, rising in Horn-sund Peak to 4560 ft. Whales frequent the adjacent seas, and the islands are visited by European whalers in the summer. Spitz bergen was discovered by Willoughby in 1553. Bear Island lies inter mediate between Spitzbergen and Norway. II. Caucasia. \u00a7 10. Boundaries \u2014 Natural Features \u2014 Climate and Pro ductions. \u2014 Caucasia embraces the territory on both sides of the great range of Caucasus from the remarkable depression in which the lake and river of Manitch 3 lie to the river Aras and Mt. Ararat in the S. It takes in the whole breadth of the isthmus between the Black Sea and the Caspian, as far S. as the Turkish frontier in 41\u00b0 50 N. lat. on the former, and the Persian frontier in 38\u00b0 20' on the latter ; the boundary lines both in the N. and S. cross diagonally between the seas, just as the Caucasian range does. The leading feature in this region is, of course, Caucasus itself, which commences on the shores of the Black Sea, near the Strait of Yenikale, and ter minates in the peninsula of Apsheron on the Caspian. On the N. side it rises from a low steppe, which intervenes between the rivers Terek and Kuma : on the S. side it is faced by an extensive highland region, which connects it with Ararat. The rivers follow the slopes to the Caspian and Black Seas ; the Caspian receiving the Km with the Aras in Trans-Caucasia, and the Terek and Kuma in Cis-Caucasia, while the Black Sea receives only one important river, the Kuban. The only practicable pass across Central Caucasus is that of Dariel, which follows the course of the Terek, and has its entrance guarded by the fortress of Vladi-Kaukas. We add some few particulars as to the district. 1 Tbe population of Sevastopol has sunk from above 40,000 in 1842 to 8218 in 1863. 2 It seems probable that the Black Sea and Caspian were once united by a channel that followed the line of the Manitch."], [385, "Chap. XVI. CLIMATE, PRODUCTIONS, ETC. 369 Mountains and Rivers. \u2014 Caucasus is divided into 3 sections \u2014 Wes tern, Central, and Eastern ; of these the Central one, between 42 '' and 45\u00b0 40' E. long., is the loftiest and contains the culminating points of the whole range, Elbruz (18,493 ft.), Dihtau (16,941 ft.), and Kazbek (16,550 ft.). The Western range gradually approximates to the Black Sea ; the Eastern declines before reaching the Caspian. Throughout the whole range there are no less than 163 summits whose height exceeds 10,000 ft. Between Central Caucasus and the northern steppe there is a high plateau named the Kabarda: this is bounded westward by a lateral ridge emanating from Elbruz, which forms the watershed between the Black Sea and the Caspian on the N. side of Caucasus. From the further extremity of the central section an important offset, known as the Caucasus of Andish, strikes off N.E. towards the Caspian : and it is this range, and not the eastern section of the main range, which is regarded as the limit between Cis-Caucasia and Trans-Caucasia. The lateral valleys of the Caucasus are very numerous and divided from each other by lofty barriers : the Russians succeeded in subduing the war like population by sealing up the entrances to the valleys with forts or outposts, so as to prevent combination. The Caucasus was, in short, besieged very much as a fortress might be. The Terek and the Kuban emanate from the two extremities of central Caucasus, the Terek rising on Kazbek, and crossing the Kabarda in a northerly direction to the border ofthe steppe, where it turns round E. to the Caspian; and the Kuban rising on Elbruz and taking a more northerly sweep, receiving in its course to the Black Sea a vast number of tributaries from the valleys of Western Caucasus. In Trans-Caucasia, a range, known as the Peranga Mts., emanating from the Central Caucasus, divides the isthmus unequally, giving a long slope to the Caspian, and a short one to the Black Sea ; the latter is drained by the Eion, the former by the Kur, which rises in the neighbourhood of the Black Sea, and flows N.E. in its upper course and then S.E., receiving on one side the whole drainage of the southern face of Eastern Caucasus, and on the other a large proportion of that of the Armenian highlands, which reaches it through its important tributary the Aras. The Kur crosses in its mid course an extensive steppe, named Kara, and in its lower course a broad maritime plain, which fringes the Caspian. A large lake named Goukcha or Sevan, with an area of 389 sq. m., lies embosomed in the highlands S. of the Kur at an elevation of about 6000 ft., and sends its surplus waters to the Aras. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The climate is, on the whole, favourable : every gradation of temperature exists, of course, in a country of such varying elevation, from the perpetual snows of Caucasus to the almost tropical summer heat of the plains. The soil of Trans-Caucasia is rich, but agriculture is at a low ebb : a species of millet, called \" khomi,\" is grown in the western provinces, and tobacco in Guriel. The vine flourishes and wine is abundant. The silk-worm is considerably cultivated along the shores of the Caspian. Timber is abundant, particularly on the western slopes towards the Black Sea. Mineral springs are numerous, and the peninsula of Apsheron is noted for its naphtha springs, which are held in high reverence by the Persian fire worshippers ; the same district also abounds in lakes, from which large quantities of salt are extracted. \u00a7 11. Inhabitants. \u2014 Political Divisions. \u2014 Towns. \u2014 The Cau casus region has in all ages been occupied by a great number of distinct tribes, each using a language unintelligible to the rest. r 3"], [386, "370 RUSSIA. \u2014 CAUCASIA. Book I. In ancient times the number of languages spoken in the market-place of Dioscurias was according to one authority 70, according to another 130 : and at the present day the admixture is equally observable. The tribes of Caucasus itself (the mountains) may be classed under 4 heads \u2014 (1) the Circassians on the northern slopes of the western section nearly as far as the sources of the Kuban ; (2) the OseteB or (as they call themselves) Iron, in the central section, \\V. of Kasbek ; (3) the Mizjeji or Tchetohenes, E. of Kasbek and on the Andish Caucasus ; and (4) the Lesghians in the eastern section. The valleys on the southern slope of the western section opening on to the Black Sea are occupied by the Abassians, and the remainder of the Trans- Caucasian district by the widely extended Georgian race in the follow ing 5 chief divisions: \u2014 (1) Suanians, in the valleys S. of Elbruz; (2) Mingrelians, between the rivers Ingur and Eion ; (3) Imeritians, in the south-eastern portion of the Eion basin, with Kutais as their capital ; (4) Guriel, a maritime region, partly Eussian, partly Turkish, S. of the Eion; and (5) the Georgians proper, in the extensive basin of the Kur. Armenians are very numerous in Trans-Caucasia, and Cossacks in Cis-Caucasia, chiefly along the lines of the Kuban and Terek, while the steppes N. of these rivers are occupied by roaming tribes of Kalmucks and Xogai Tartars. Of the Caucasian nations the Circassians are particularly noted both for their noble appearance and their warlike spirit : in the former respect the Georgians also have considerable though not equal fame. The Osetes, though numerically unimportant, are interesting in an ethnological point of view from their peculiarities of language, appearance, and manners \u2014 light hair, blue eyes, and Teutonic cus toms being noticeable among them. Most of the Caucasians are Mohammedans. The Eussians divide the country into two great sections \u2014 Cis-Caucasia and Trans-Caucasia, which are subdivided into 5 governments, and 3 territories, as follow : \u2014 1 Shemakha, the former capital of this government, having been destroyed by \u00abn earthquake, Baku has s'icceeded to the position.

In point of shape, Asia resembles a trapezium, formed by lines connecting the Isthmus of Suez in the S.W. with the Gulf of Tonquin in the S.E., and with Kara Bay in the N.W., and these two latter with Cape Chelagskoi in the N.E. Its area is estimated at 16,352,362 sq. m., or, inclusive of the adja cent islands, at 17,326,794 sq. m. ; its coast-line at 35,500 m. ; and its population (islands included) at 798,600,000. History of Discovery. \u2014 The gradual progress of discovery in ancient times has already been described in the ' Student's Manual of Ancient Geography.' The Greek geographers, to whom we owe almost all our information relative to this part of the world, were acquainted with the southern coast line throughout its whole extent, and with the interior as far N. as the Sea of Aral, the River Sir-daria or Jaxartes, and the Himalayas. Beyond these limits they only knew the names of the great mountain chains of Central Asia, and of the tribes living there. It was not until the 13th century that any additional informa tion reached Western Europe ; the conquests of the Mongols under Gengis Khan and their subsequent advance into Europe, directed attention to this quarter, and led to the journeys of the monks Car pini in 12+6 and Ruysbroeck or Rubriquis in 1252 to the Altai region, the latter penetrating to Karakorum, S. of Lake Baikal, on the edge of the Great Desert of Gobi. Marco Polo, a Venetian, who resided at the court of the Mongol Emperor Kublai-Khan between 1275 aud 1292, was the first to notice Japan, Pekin, the great plain of Siberia, the Spice Islands, Sumatra, &c. Subsequently to the opening of commu nication with India by the Cape of Good Hope, the Portuguese led the way in maritime research : early in the 1 6th century they explored the coasts of the Malay PeniDSula, Siam, and Cochin-China, and navi gated the seas adjacent to the S.E. angle of the continent, discovering the Philippines, Celebes, New Guinea, and other islands. In the latter part of the same century the Russians began their conquests in Siberia. which were continued for more than a century and terminated in the annexation of Kamtchatka by Peter the Great in 1696 ; their progress being marked by the discovery of the Yenisei in 1598, the Lena in 1640, the middle aud lower Amoor in 1644, the Anadir and Behring Strait in 1648. The exploration of the N. and N.E. has been suc cessfully prosecuted by the Russians in the face of most serious obstacles: in 1711 the islands of New Siberia were discovered: in 1 728 Behriug traced the coast of the strait that bears his name to Cape East, and in 1741 he crossed over to America: and since his time successive explorers, ending with Wrangel, have completed the line of the N. coast. The interior of China was explored by the Jesmt missionaries between the beginning of the 17th and the middle of the"], [390, "374 ASIA Book II. 18th cents. ; since their expulsion the Chinese have endeavoured to exclude foreigners altogether from their country, and it is only within the few last years that China has been at all re-opened. The Russians have gradually extended their influence over the N. frontier of China, and have made known the general character of that portion of Asia ; but the S.W. of China adjoining Burmah and Tibet is still a terra incognita. The Himalaya region has been extensively explored by British officers, who have crossed it into Tibet at various points, and bave carried their researches across the Karakoram range to Khoten and Yarkand. \u00a7 2. General Characteristics. \u2014 The continent of Asia is dis tinguished by the following characteristics : \u2014 (1) Its size, in which respect it considerably exceeds the joint areas of Europe and Africa. (2) Its general elevation. It is pre-eminently the continent of plateaus, the whole central region being occupied by plateaus of vast extent and occasionally of extraordinary height. (3) Its massive form, the peninsular portions occupying only about one fifth of the whole area, the remaining four-fifths forming a compact solid mass. (4) Its deficiency of coast-line as compared with area (the proportion being about 1 m. of coast to 460 sq. m. of area) and the great remoteness of the interior from the sea. (5) The colossal dimensions of its mountain-chains, which exceed in elevation those of any other division. (6) Its inland sea and river-systems, of which Aral with its two great rivers, Lob Nor, and Lake Balkash may be cited as examples. (7) The frequent occurrence of twin rivers, as the Euphrates and Tigris, the Ganges and Brahmapootra, and the Sir-daria and Amoo. (8) The highly continental character of the climate. \u00a7 3. Seas and Coast-line. \u2014 The coasts of Asia are washed hy 3 oceans, the Arotic in the N., the Pacifio in the E., and the Indian in the S. The two first are connected by Behring Strait, which narrows to 36 m. in 65\u00b0 33' N. lat. : the two last have numerous connecting channels between the islands that beset the S.E. angle of the continent. The eastern coast is fringed by an almost continuous series of semi-inclosed seas, formed partly by peninsulas and partly by lines of islands. The most prominent peninsulas are Kamtchatka and Corea ; and the principal lines or groups of islands, the Aleutian, which stretch across between America and Kamtchatka ; the Knrile, which continue the line of Kamtchatka to the S. ; the Japan group; and more S., the Philippines and Borneo. The seas connected with these objects are the Sea of Kamtohatka, enclosed between the con verging coasts of Asia and America, and the line of the Aleu tian isles in the S. ; the Sea of Okhotsk, between Kamtchatka and the mainland, and closed seawards by the Kurile islands ; the Sea of Japan, between the Japan islands and the mainland ; the Yellow Sea, between Corea and China ; the Eastern Sea (the \" Tong Hai \" of"], [391, "Chap. XVII. SEAS AND COAST-LINE. 375 the Chinese), between the Loo-Choo islands and China; and the China Sea, between the Philippines and the mainland. On the S. coast the seas are more open : three peninsulas protrude southwards, the Malay Peninsula in the E., Hindostan in the centre, and Arabia in the W. : the Sea of Bengal intervenes between the first and second, and the Arabian Sea between the second and third, the former narrowing up to the Bay of Bengal, and the latter to the inclosed Persian Gulf. From the W. side of the Arabian Sea the Red Sea protrudes N. towards the Mediterranean. As the highway between Western Europe and India, this sea occupies a most important posi tion in commercial geography. The capes, bays, and other features of these coasts are described below. Capes, Bays, &c. \u2014 (1) Commencing in the N.W. with the Arctic Sea, we first meet with Kara Bay, forming the division between Europe and Asia ; then follow the Gulf of Obi, with its easterly arm, the Gulf of Taz ; tho Gulf of Yenisei ; the capes of Taimur aud Tcheliuskin or North-East, with the Bay of Taimur between them, and themselves the most northerly points of the most northerly peninsula of the conti nent: Cape Chelagskoi, in 171\u00b0 2u' E. long., and East Cape on Behring Strait. The coast is generally low, and ice-bound : between the two last capes the water is open during the summer months. The heaps of drift-wood and the remains of gigantic animals of now extinct species imbedded in the ice are the most interesting objects along this coast. (2) On the side of the Pacific, we meet with the Gulf of Anadir, immediately S. of Behring Strait ; Cape L\u00bbpatka, at the extremity of the peninsula of Kamtchatka ; the two gulfs into which the sea of Okhotsk bifurcates at its N.E. extremity, named Penjinsk and Ghijinsk; the Gulf of Tartary, which separates the Isle of Saghalien from the mainland, and forms the connecting link between the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan ; Victoria Bay, in Mantchooria ; the Gulfs of Leaotong and Pe-chi-li. which form the inmost divisions of the Yellow Sea; the Strait of Formosa, between the island of that name and the mainland ; the Gulf of Tonquin, enclosed eastward by the island of Hainan ; Cape Cambodia, at the extremity of the peninsula of Cochin-China; and the Gulf of Siam, between the Indo-Chinese and Malay peninsulas. A considerable portion of this E. coast is steep and deficient in harbours ; this is the case more particularly in Mant chooria and Cochin-China. (3) The China Sea terminates at Cape Romania, at the S.E. ex tremity of the Malay Peninsula, from which point the Strait of Singa pore leads to Cape Bonlus at the S.W. extremity of the peninsula ; then follows westward the Malacca Strait, between Sumatra and the penin sula, leading into the Indian Ocean. In the Bay of Bengal we have to notice the Gulf of Martaban, into which the River Irawaddy disem bogues, and Cape Negrais to the W. of that gulf. The coasts of Hindostan are devoid of any marked irregularities : between Ceylon and the mainland intervene Palk Strait and the Gulf of Manaar, the former commencing at Point Calimere, and terminating on the side of the Gulf of Manaar at the singular series of shoals and islands known as Adam's Bridge. Cape Comorin form3 the S. extremity of the penin sula. The Gulfs of Cambay and Cutch, with the intervening peninsula of Gujerat, break the line of the western coast. Between Arabia and"], [392, "ASIA. Book II. 376 Beloochistan the Sea of Oman gradually contracts to the Strait of Ormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf with the Ocean. Bas-el-Hadd forms the E. extremity of Arabia, and from this point the coast trends westward to the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb ' the gate of tears.' The Red Sea stretches to the N.W. from this strait for 1400 m. towards the Mediterranean, and terminates in the two divergent elongated Gulfs of Suez in the W. and Akaba in the E. The coasts of the Indian Ocean are for the most part fringed with parallel mountain ranges : this is the case throughout Arabia and along the peninsula of Hindostan : enormous deltas occur in other parts, as at the mouths of the Indus, Ganges, and Irawaddy. Good harbours are scarce from both these causes. (4) The part of the Mediterranean that belongs to Asia is termed the Levant, from its eastern position relatively to Italy : the coasts of Palestine and Asia Minor are tolerably regular, the most noticeable objects being the Gulf of Iskenderoon at the N.E. angle of the Levant, and the Gulf of Adalia. The W. coast of Asia Minor is one continued succession of gulfs and headlands, of which, as well as of the irregu larities in the coast of the Sea of Marmara, we shall give a description in a future place. \u00a74. Internal Configuration \u2014 Plateaus and Plains. \u2014 The configuration of Asia has a very distinctive character. A continuous series of plateaus or highlands, commencing on the shores of the Mediterranean and stretching away to the maritime plains of the Pacific, serves as the nucleus of the continent, around which are grouped numerous large but dissevered plains. The plateaus pro bably occupy an area of 9 millions of sq. m., or more than half the continent. They fall into two great divisions, eastern and western, which again admit of several subdivisions dependent on varia tions of position and elevation. The point at which the eastern and western divisions meet is the remarkable mountain-knot of Tsnng-ling, situated at the intersection of the 74th meridian and the 37th parallel, near the headwaters of the Gilgit branch of the Indus. From this point 3 masses of highland diverge to the N.E., S.W., and N., the first and largest of which is buttressed by the ranges of Himalaya and Kuenlun, the second by Hindoo-Koosh and Suliman, while the third consists of a comparatively contracted but highly elevated region which, under the name of Pamir, or, as the natives expressively term it, Bam-i-doonya, the ' Terraced Eoof of the World,' forms a connecting link with the more northerly range of Thian shan. Thus, as viewed from the plains or from the outside of the plateaus, no less than 5 mighty ranges appear to emanate from Tsung-ling, viz. : Himalaya to the S.E., Kuenlun1 tothe E., Pamir to 1 Some authorities would add the Kara- koram Mts. as a sixth range interme- diate between Kuenlun and Himalaya, and running parallel to the latter. It seems more probable, however, that the name Karakoram applies to the western secii\"U of K\u0153Blun. Its position is best j defined by that of the Karakoram pass, I which lies in 78\u00b0 il long., between tlie ! Shayak branch ol the Indus and a branch j of the Yarkand river, thus cros-ing tbe ! watershed between India and Central Asia. j 't cannot well be distinct from Kueulun !

But in reality Himalaya and Kuenlun are little else than the edges of the elevated plateau of Tibet (16,000 ft. above the sea), the whole of \u25a0which is probably a mass of mountain-tops: the angle between Hindoo-Koosh and Suliman is also filled with mountain ranges, and is altogether a very elevated region ; while Pamir, towards the N., is totally devoid of a crest range, though formerly the Bolor range was represented as here situated. The eastern plateau extends far beyond the limits of its highest section, and includes a second and less elevated region between Kuenlun and Thian-shan; a third between Kuenlun and the Altai ranges ; and a fourth between the E. limbs of Thian-shan and the ranges of In-shan and Khin-gan in Eastern Mongolia. The character of this last section is conveyed in its designation of the Sandy Desert of Shamo or Gobi. The western plateau similarly declines to the moderately elevated plateau of Iran, which extends W. to the valley of the Tigris, supported hy EHran on the side of the Caspian, and by the ranges of Zagrus on the side of the Tigris ; thence the plateau is continued through the lofty and knotty highlands of Armenia or Ararat into Anatolia, where it spreads out into a plateau buttressed by Taurus in the S., and declining gradually N. towards the Black Sea. The framework of the continent is completed (1) by the belt of high ground which emanates from the N.E. angle of the eastern plateau, and is marked in maps as the Yahlonoi Mts., though it is doubtful whether any crest exists, and whether it should not rather be described as a plateau : this range is succeeded by the Stannovoi Mts. to Behring Strait ; (2) by the prolongations of the Himalayan range, E. to the shores of the Pacific in Southern China, and S. to the Malay penin- sula ; (3) by the isolated plateau of Deccan in the peninsula of Hin- dostan ; and (4) by the almost equally isolated plateau of Arabia, which may, however, be linked to the western plateau by the range of Lebanon and the highlands of Palestine. The plains adjacent to the plateaus above described are :\u2014 (1) the vast depressed plain of Northern Asia between the Altai Mts. and the Arctic Ocean, occupy- ing an area of about 4,500,000 sq. m. (2) The yet more depressed region surrounding the Sea of Aral and the Caspian. (3) The plain of the Euphrates and Tigris, extending from the head of the Persian Gulf to the Armenian highlands. (4) The plains of the Indus and Ganges in Northern Hindostan. (5) The maritime plain of Northern China about the lower courses of the Yang-tze and the Hoang-ho. \u00a7 5. Hydrography. \u2014 The peculiar feature in the hydrography of Asia is the large area of continental drainage interposed between the oceanic slopes, and severing them from each other by wide intervals. The most important receptacles of this continental drainage are the Sea of Aral, the Caspian, Lob Nor in Thian-shan-nanloo, and Lake"], [395, "Chap. XVII. HYDROGRAPHY. 379 Hamoon in Afghanistan. But in addition to the regions included in these basins there are extensive districts on the plateaus of Iran and Anatolia, and enclosed basins on the edge of the northern plain, as about lakes Balkash and Issik-kol, which are wholly shut out from communication with the sea: and probably the sum total of the continental drainage would equal a third of the area of the con tinent. The remaining two-thirds are pretty equally distributed between the three basins of the Arctic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, the Atlantic having only a very restricted area on the shores of its enclosed seas, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. (1) The Arctic slope is the best defined, and has the most equable distribu tion of waters, its three great rivers the Obi, the Yenisei, and the Lena ramifying largely in their upper courses : the economical value of these rivers is much diminished by the desolate country through which their lower courses flow, and the ice-bound sea in which they terminate. (2) The Pacific slope commences in the very heart of the eastern plateau, and the \"river-courses are much affected by the mountain-chains which bound the plateau on the E. Thus the Yang tze-kiang and the Hoang-ho which approximate each other both in their upper and lower courses, are separated by an interval of 1000 m. in their mid course. As a commercial route the Amoor is of great interest to Europeans, inasmuch as it opens a way between Siberia and the Pacific. The hydrographical territories of the Pacific and Indian Oceans come into close contact in the S.E. angle of Tibet, where the Yang-tze-kiang and the Brahmapootra run in parallel valleys, with the Irawaddy possibly intervening, the Menam and Me-kong being also not far off : the river-courses appear to be com pressed into a funnel at this point. (3) The Indian Ocean receives a portion of the drainage of Tibet through the Brahmapeetra and the Indus, the sources of which are in close contact on the N. of Hima laya : the Ganges intercepts the streams that flow down the S. face of that great range, and carries their waters to the Bay of Bengal. More to the W., the twin rivers Euphrates and Tigris carry down the drainage of the Armenian highlands, to which the Tigris adds that of the western border of the Iranian plateau. Of the conti nental rivers the most important are the twin rivers of the Sea of Aral, the Sir-daria or Jaxartes, and the Amoo or Oxus, which lead the way from Eussia to Central Asia, and are of inestimable value to the countries through which they pass. The headwaters of these closely adjoin those of the rivers that rise on the E. side of Pamir and Thian-shan, and which, converging to a focus, are carried down to Lob Nor by the river variously named the Tarim or Ergno Koi. The watershed between the basins of Lob Nor and the Aral is well defined, and it will probably be across the barrier of Thian-shan and Pamir that European commerce and civilization will reach Western"], [396, "380 ASIA. Book II. China. The rivers will be more particularly described under the heads of the countries to which they belong. We here append a table with a comparative statement of their lengths and basin areas : \u2014 \u00a7 6. Climate. \u2014 About one-eighth part of Asia falls within the tropical zone, another eighth within the Arctic zone, and the re maining three-fourths within the North Temperate zone. The tropical portion of Asia is favourably affected by its oceanic position and by the elevation of considerable portions of it. Eain falls copiously at certain seasons which vary with the position of different localities, and though the heat of the low districts is excessive, spots may be found, as on the Neilgherry hills in southern Hindostan, where the tem perature resembles that of England. The portion of Asia that fall* within the Temperate zone is distinguished by its fiercely continents character : the central plateaus are high and bare, as well as remot* from the sea ; their vast expanse mitigates indeed to a certain extern Basins aud Rivers.

A large portion of the Siberian plain lies within the Temperate zone ; but the designation in this case is an utter misnomer, for the cold of Eastern Siberia is of a thoroughly Arctic character, the mean winter temperature at Yakutsk in 62\u00b0 N. lat. (about the latitude of the Shetlands) being 36\u00b0-3 below zero. Eain decreases from W. to E. on the Siberian plain, and is through out deficient. The summer heat is high in the months of June, July, and August. The Arctic portion of Asia is almost uninhabit able : the plains are perpetually frozen, and the great rivers are ice bound from October, or even September, to June. The mean annual temperature at Nijni-Kolymsk, which is far from being the most northerly spot, is stated to be 12\u00b0-05, or about 20\u00b0 below the freez ing point. \u00a7 7. Vegetation. \u2014 The flora of Asia is of the most varied cha racter, and frequently its varieties are exhibited within very circum scribed areas in consequence of the contending influences of latitude and altitude. On the Himalayan range, tropical, temperate, and arctic floras occupy successive zones of altitude, and a similar gradation, though not to the same extent, may be observed on the Ghauts and the Neilgherries of Hindostan. Another marked pe culiarity is the great altitude at which plants thrive on the high plateaus, corn ripening in Tibet at 18,544 ft., and barley in Chinese Tartary at 16,000 ft., while the birch attains its full size at 14,068 ft. In Northern and Central Asia the flora resembles generally that of Europe : an extensive belt of forest, composed of pine, fir, and birch, occupies central Siberia from W. to E. ; and the slopes of Altai and of the other mountain ranges are clothed with forests. Southern and Eastern Asia yield woods of a distinctive character, in some cases highly serviceable for building purposes, as the teak, and in others foi ornamental or dye purposes, as the sandal and sapan. The desert regions of Arabia, Persia, and Central Asia also have a distinctive flora, consisting of acacias, tamarisks, and other thorny plants. Fruit trees are numerous: Western Asia is the native1 land of the cherry, peach, apricot, melon, fig, almond, damson, and mulberry : Southern Asia yields various kinds of palms (particularly the date and cocoa nut), the banyan, tamarind, orange, &c. The most valuable commer cial plants are rice, which is largely grown in India, Burmah, and ' The names of some of these fruits in- ' nectarine' is Itself a Persian word ; and dicate their native soil: 'cherry' has 'apricot' is an Arabian word, its Latin already been noticed in this respect (p. 82) : name, malum Armeniacum, referring it to ' damson ' is the damascene, or Damascus Armenia. plum ; ' peach ' is a corruption of ' Persian ' ;"], [398, "Book II.

Saddling a Camel. \u00a7 8. Zoology. \u2014 Asia is fortunate in the number and utility of its domesticated animals. It is the native soil of the horse, which still attains great excellence in Arabia and Persia, as also does the ass. It bas useful varieties of sheep and goats, adapted to high altitudes, and generally yielding a fine wool. In addition to the ordinary ox, it possesses among ruminants the yak, which serves as a beast of burthen over the highest mountain-passes; the Bactrian or two humped camel, which is invaluable in the deserts of Turkestan and Persia ; the one-humped camel of Arabia ; the zebu or humped ox, held sacred by the Brahmins ; and the reindeer of Northern Siberia. The elephant is tamed and turned to great account as a beast of burden. Poultry is very abundant : Asia has contributed the pea cock, and various kinds of fowls (the Cochin-China most recently) to our farm-yards, and the pheasant to our coverts. The wild animals of Asia are pre-eminent for their size and vigour. Among the more remarkable, we may notice the royal tiger of Hindostan and the Malay islands, remarkable for its ferocity ; the Bengal lion, with its fine mane ; the maneless lion of Gujerat ; the cheetah, which is trained by the natives to hunt ; various species of wild asses, remarkably shy and fleet, frequenting the desert plains and"], [399, "Chap. XVII. MINERALOGY \u2014 ETHNOLOGY. 383 table-lands of Persia, Cutch in India, Tibet (the kiang), and Mon golia (the dzigguetai) ; wild species of the ox tribe, such as the wild buffalo; wild species of the sheep tribe, the ibex of Taurus, the argali of Siberia and Kamtchatka, the rass of the Persian plateau, the sha of Little Tibet, &c. ; the musk-deer of the Alpine ranges of Central Asia ; various valuable fur-bearing animals, such as the sable and the ermine of Siberia, and the sea-otter, which frequents the North Pacific coasts ; the gavial of the Ganges, the largest of the crocodile order ; and the venomous cobra capella, which is tamed by the Indian snake-charmers. The birds of Southern Asia are conspicuous for brilliancy of plumage. \u00a7 9. Mineralogy. \u2014 Asia has been ever famous for her yield of precious stones and the more valuable metals : nor does she appear to be deficient in supplies of coal, iron, and other less costly but equally useful minerals, though there has been less call as yet for these materials. Diamonds are found in India, the Ural, and tho Altai districts ; rubies and sapphires in Ceylon, China, Burmah, and Turkestan ; turquoises in Persia and Arabia ; agates in Tibet and in parts of the Gobi desert ; the cat's-eye in Ceylon ; emeralds in Wes tern Siberia ; topazes, beryls, and amethysts in the Himalaya, Ural, and Altai ; and lapis-lazuli in Badakshan, which lies N. of Hindoo Koosh. Gold is abundant on the Asiatic side of the Urals, and in the Altai region, as well as in China, Tibet, Japan, and the Indo- Chinese peninsula : silver in all the above districts, and in Armenia and Anatolia ; lead about Nertchinsk in the Amoor region, and in China ; quicksilver in China, Japan, and Ceylon ; malachite in the Ural regions ; tin in China, the Malay peninsula, and the isle of Banca. Salt is found in Armenia, Syria, the Punjab, China, and Western Siberia. The coal-fields of India are already largely worked for railway purposes. \u00a7 10. Ethnology. \u2014 Asia contains representatives of most, if not of all, the divisions of the human race. The great bulk of the popu lation, indeed, belongs to two only out of the six divisions, viz., the Caucasian and the Mongolian, in the respective proportions of 2-5ths of the former to 3-5ths of the latter. But besides these, the Malay division is represented to the number of about a quarter of a million on the Malay peninsula : the Negro type is closely approached by some of the aboriginal tribes of India (such as the Doms of the Ku maon valleys), and in a less degree by the Negritoes of the Indian islands : and there are tribes in the extreme N.E. (the Tchukchees) which are supposed to be related to the native American. The lin guistic varieties are very numerous, and have been as yet but imper fectly classified. In the inflecting class there are two great families \u2014the Shemitic, of which the Arabian is the leading example ; and the Indo-European, which falls into two subdivisions, the Indian (of"], [400, "SIBERIA. Bool II. 384 which Sanscrit is the leading example), and the Iranian or Persian, to which we may probably attach the Armenian and several of the Cau casus languages. To the agglutinative class belong (1) the various languages of the Tartar tribes, including the Osmanli-Turks, the Turcomans, the Kirghiz, the Bashkires, and the Takutes ; (2) the languages of the Asiatic Finns, such as the Samoiedes, Yeniseians, Vogules, and Ostiakes ; and (3) the languages of the Tunguses of Siberia and Mantchooria, and the Kalmucks. To the isolating class belong the Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan, and Indo-Chinese tongues. \u00a7 11. Political Divisions. \u2014 The chief political divisions of Asia are: \u2014 (1) The Eussian territory, embracing the whole of Siberia, Transcaucasia, the north of Turkestan, and a portion of Mantchooria S. of the Amoor. (2) The Turkish empire, comprising Syria, Ar menia, and Anatolia. (3) Arabia, which is territorially, though not politically, important. (4) The Persian Empire, on the western half of the table-land of Iran Proper. (5) The British dominions, in Hindostan, and along the western coast of the Indo-Chinese pen insula to Singapore. Lastly (6) the Chinese Empire, stretching from the shores of the Pacific to the Thian-shan range in the W., and oc cupying (if we include in it the allied, or perhaps rather subordinate, kingdom of Tibet) the whole central highland between the Altai range in the N. and Himalaya in the S. Among the lesser divisions we may enumerate the independent states of the Indo-Chinese peninsula \u2014 Cochin-China, Siam, and Burmah ; the nations occupying the eastern part of the table-land of Iran, viz. : Afghanistan and Beloochistan ; and the independent sovereignties of Turkestan\u2014 Khiva, Bokhara, &c. The European nations most influential on this continent are the Bus sians and the British, the latter having, in addition to their Indian territories, the island of Hong-kong off the coast of China, Aden, a packet-station on the coast of Arabia ; and Perim, in the middle of the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. The French have a footing in Hin dostan to the extent of some four or five settlements, embracing an area of less than 200 sq. m. : they have also established them selves lately in the south of Cochin-China. The once powerful Portuguese retain only Goa, Daman, and Diu, in Hindostan, and the island of Macao off the coast of China. The Dutch are influential on the islands of the Indian Archipelago. II. \u2014 Siberia. \u00a7 12. Boundaries \u2014 Natural Features \u2014 Climate and Pro ductions. \u2014 The boundaries of Siberia are determined on thiee sides by natural objects, viz., N. by the Arctic Ocean ; E. by the Pacific Ocean and Behring Strait ; and W. by the range of Ural.1 In the S. 1 For area and population s \"e p. 349."], [401, "Chap. XVII. BOUNDARIES, NATURAL FEATURES, ETC. 385 the boundary can hardly be considered as finally settled : on the side of the Pacific it has been carried S. of the Amoor to 44\u00b0 307 N. lat., whence it cuts across Mantchooria to the sources of the Argun in 49\u00b0 30* N. lat. : in Turkestan the Eussians have advanced their con quests along the Sir-daria to the confluence of the Tchirtchik, and may go yet further S. than this : between the Sir-daria and Lake Issik-kol the boundary is unsettled, but more to the E. it follows the edge of the central plateau by Lake Zaisan to the Sayansk moun tains, and crosses the Selenga at Kiakhta, S. of Lake Baikal, to the sources of the Argun. The western portion of Siberia is a low plain of remarkable uniformity extending from the Caspian to the Obi, and containing vast steppes \u2014 the Kirghiz Steppe in the extreme S. ad- Kishtymali and its Lake (Siberia), aa Been from the Ural range jacent to the Caspian Sea, Aral Sea, and Lake Balkash ; the Steppe of Ishim between the southern Ural and the river Irtish, and the Steppe of Barabinska between the mid-Irtish and the Obi. A belt of sorest bounds the steppes on the N., and beyond this follows the Tundra or frozen plain which surrounds the lower courses of the Obi and Yenisei to the shores of tho Arctic Ocean. E. of the upper Obi the country becomes more varied : offsets from the Altai system project N- on each side of the Yenisei, the Teletskoi Mountains on the W., and an offset of Sayansk on the E., enclosing a broad and fertile valley which is regarded as the most favoured part of Siberia. Lake Baikal is imbedded between parallel chains of considerable mod. geo. s"], [402, "386 SIBERIA. Book II. elevation : more to the E. rises tbe Yablonoi plateau or range, sepa rating the basins of the Selenga and Amoor, and still further E. Stannovoi, stretching to East Cape on Behring Strait: a southern limb from the Stannovoi range forms the spine of the peninsula of Kamtchatka. Numerous volcanoes occur on the E. coast, the loftiest of which, Eiutsehewsker, attains a height of 15,825 ft. The chief rivers of Siberia are the Obi, the Yenisei, the Lena, and the Amoor, of which some statistical statements have been already given, and which are further described in the following paragraphs. Rivers and Lakes. \u2014 The Obi is formed of two great branches, of which the western or the Irtish, is really the largest, and has the best claim therefore to give name to the trunk stream. The Irtish rises on the central plateau, and has Lake Zaisan as its upper reservoir, issuing from which it crosses a high plain to the edge of the plateau, descends rapidly through the hills to the plain, and flows N.W., receiv ing 1. the Ishim and the Tobol, to its confluence with the Obi in 61\u00b0 N. lat. The Obi or eastern branch is formed of several streams which rise on the edge of the plateau, the chief being the Biya and the Kotun, the former of which traverses lake Teletskoi or Altai : the name of Obi is given to the river formed by the confluence of these streams near Biisk. The Obi flows N.W. and receives rt. the Tom (of Tomsk), the Chulim, and the Ket. Below the j unction of the Irtish it reaches the sea by a circuitous route, which carries it near the Obdorsk Mountains in the W. The Yenisei is also composed of two great branches, which rise in close proximity on the central plateau, and thence diverge to a great interval. The western of these branches, or the Yenisei proper, is known in its higher course as the Dia Kem, which runs W. and reaches the lower level between the prolongations of the Sayansk and Te letskoi ranges. The eastern branch emanates from Lake Kos-gol, and, aa the Selenga, descends to lake Baikal, receiving in its course the Orkhon : it issues from the S. extremity of Baikal as the Lower Angara, the Upper Angara being a feeder of the lake which joins it in the N. : beltrw the confluence of the Oka, its name is changed to the Tunguska, which designation it retains to its confluence with the Yenisei: thence the united stream flows nearly due N. to the Ocean. The Lena rises near Lake Baikal, and flows N.E. to the junction ofthe Aldan, whence it turns N. to the sea. The Amoor has its head-waters partly on the central plateau and partly in the mountainous region that bounds the plateau on the N. It is formed by the confluence of the Onon and the Argun, the former of which is also knowu in its lower course as the Shilka, and the lattei in its upper course as the Kerlon. Below the confluence of these streams the Amoor forces its way in a circuitous course through the mountains which beset it, and then flows S.E. to the confluence of the Soongari, the chief receptacle of the drainage of the Khin-gan range : theuce the Amoor turns N.E. to its embouchure opposite the N. ex tremity of Saghalien island : its outlet is frozen up for 7 months in the year. With the exception of occasional rapids, it is navigable by the Shilka to the foot of the Yablonoi Mts. Among the less important streams we may notice the Yana, the Indi girka, and the Kolyma, which reach the Arctic Ocean between the Lena"], [403, "HYDROGRAPHY \u2014 CLIMATE, etc. 387 Chap. XVII. and Behring Strait ; and the Anadir, wliich joins a gulf of the same name S. of Behring Strait. Water Communications. \u2014 The disposition ofthe Siberian rivers adapts them admirably to serve as great highways of traffic between the E. and \"VV. Tbe Lena conducts to the Angara, the Angara and Tun guska to the Yenisei, and the westerly feeders of the Yenisei interlace with the easterly ones of the Obi, which latter carries the traffic west ward to the confines of European Russia by means of the various affluents of the Irtish. A canal of some 30 or 40 m. between the Chulim and the Yenisei alone is needed to form a water-way from the Ural Mts. to within 18 m. of Kiakhta. Another canal between Lake Baikal and the Shilka would complete the water-way to the Pacific. Lakes. \u2014 Of the numerous lakes in, or on the borders of Siberia, we may specify the following as the most important : \u2014 Climate and productions. \u2014 The particulars given in the preceding division of this chapter as to climate and productions, apply so largely to Siberia, that little remains to be added here. The chief resource of the country is its mineral wealth, which is distributed over the moun tainous districts, Barnaul being the head-quarters of the Altai, and Nertchinsk of the Yablonoi region. In addition to the precious metals, Siberia yields graphite (\"black lead\" for pencils), malachite, asbestos, antimony, zinc, and cobalt. In regard to agriculture, the mid-valley of the Yenisei is the most favoured locality, and yields wheat, rye, aud oats. Large herds of cattle are pastured about the mid-course of the Lena, and a valuable kind of sheep thrives on the western steppes. Salt is obtained from lakes and springs in various localities. The fossil tusks of the elephant are found in great numbers on the coast E. of the Lena and on the Liakhov Islands, and are an important article of com merce. The tusks of about 100 mammoths, producing 40,000 lbs. of ivory, are annually exported from the Liakhov islands alone. The fur-bearing animals are chiefly found in the eastern region, and com prise the sable, the marten, the white bear, and the fox. Commerce and Commercial Routes. \u2014 Siberia has long been the most important link in the through-traffic between China and Russia for tea via Kiakhta. The total length of this route (by far the longest laud route in the world) is 7291 m. between Moscow and the tea-growing districts, of which 4452 m. lie between Moscow and Kiakhta. The route is carried through Selenginsk to Irkutsk, crossing Lake Baikal on the ice in winter ; thence by Tomsk to Tiumen, by way of the rivers Tom, Irtish, and Tura; from Tiumen by land to Perm, and thence by the rivers Kama and Volga to Kazan and Nijni-Novgorod, and finally by rail to Moscow. The time spent on the journey between Moscow and Kiakhta is from 85 to 100 days. Commerce at Kiakhta was for- B 2 Lakes. Length in m. Area in sq. m. Elevation above sea inst. Baikal . . . .

Book II. inerly carried on solely by barter, the export of gold and silver being prohibited by Russia. In 1861 this restriction was removed, but the trade is nevertheless languishing, partly because sea-borne tea can be imported at a lower rate, and partly through the enormous smuggling that is carried on over the Chinese frontier. The Russian products exported to China are furs of an inferior kind, cloth, leather, and fossil ivory. Another important branch of commerce is that which is prose cuted from Semipolatinsk on the Irtish with the tribes of Central Asia, the chief intercourse being carried on with Chugu-chak and Kuldja across the Chinese frontier, at each of which places the Russians have a factory. Tea is again an important article of commerce, and in addi tion the local products of the interior, sheep, cattle, furs, porcelain, silk, &c, are exchanged for woollen and cotton stuffs, glass, worked iron, &c. This commerce is conducted chiefly by Tartars, Calmucks, and other natives. The Kirghiz of the Orenburg Steppe prefer the fabrics of Central Asia to those of Europe, and hence a considerable amount of cotton fabrics passes through Northern Turkestan into Russian ter ritory. \u00a7 13. Inhabitants \u2014 Political Divisions \u2014 Towns, &c. \u2014 Siberia has attained in the eyes of the world an unhappy celebrity as the penal settlement of the Eussian Empire \u2014 the receptacle of its poli- tical as well as its criminal offenders. It has been used for this purpose for two centuries, and a large Eussian population has grown up in the more habitable districts. Some of the exiles are condemned to labour in the mines; others are converted into agricultural labourers ; and others simply live under the surveillance of the police. The native Asiatic tribes are numerous ; among the more important we may specify the Kirghiz Hordes, of the S.W. ; the Ostiaks, about the lower courses of the Obi and Yenisei ; the Samoiedes, on the shores of the Arctic Ocean ; the Tunguses, about the Tunguska ; the Buriates, about Lake Baikal and the Upper Amoor ; the Yakutes, in the north-eastern district ; the independent Tchukohees, on Behring Strait; and the Kamtchatdales of Kam- tchatka. Buddhism prevails among the eastern tribes, and Moham- medanism among the western; the Samoiedes are given up to Shamanism. The country is divided into two great sections, Western and Eastern, the former of which contains the two govern- ments of Tobolsk and Tomsk, with the 3 territories of the Kir- ghizes, Semipolatinsk between Lake Balkash and the Irtish, and the newly conquered portion of Turkestan ; while Eastern Siberia con- tains the two governments of Yeniseisk and Irkutsk, and the 4 ter ritories of Trans-Baikal (coinciding nearly with Da-uria or the border region of Chinese Tartary), Yakutsk, Amooria on the 1. bank of the middle Amoor, and the Maritime region of the Pacific, including Kamtchatka, the lower Amoor, &c. Towns. \u2014 The towns call for little notice. Tobolsk (18,361) at the confluence of the Tobol and the Irtish, is the capital of Western"], [405, "389 Chap. XVII. TURKESTAN. Siberia, and Irkutsk (28,009), on the Angara, of Eastern Siberia: the latter is the most populous place in the whole country, and the entrepot of a most extensive commerce. Tomsk (20,983), on the Tom, flourishes from its proximity to the mining district, of which Barnaul (11,297), more to the S., is the centre. Omsk (19,467), on the Om, is the chief seat of the military force of Western Siberia to control the Kirghizes. Tiumen (12,593), on the Tura, S.W. of Tobolsk, is actively engaged in manufactures, and is a commercial entrepot between Russia and Central Asia. We may further notice : \u2014 Petropaulovski (9090), on the Ishim, a fortress and depot for the trade with the Kirghizes ; Semipolatinsk (6767), on the Upper Irtish, the seat of trade with the adjacent parts ofthe Chinese Empire; Krasnoiarsk (9997), on the Yenisei, the capital of the government of Yeniseisk ; Kiakhta (5431,, on the Chinese frontier, S. of lake Baikal, the station of the Russian merchants for the transaction of business with the Chinese merchants of Maimatchin, on the other side of the frontier ; Yakutsk (5665), on the Lena, a depot for the furs of N.E. Siberia ; a second Petro paulovski, a fortress on the coast of Kamtchatka, unsuccessfully attacked by the Anglo-French fleet in 1854 ; and Nicolaiefsk, near the mouth of the Amoor, the capital of the Maritime region. There are no railroads in Siberia, but the electric telegraph has been carried right across the country to the Pacific, and furnishes the readiest communication between Britain and China. Islands. \u2014 Off the N. coast of Siberia lies a desolate group of islands named Liakhov or New Siberia, which are visited for the sake of the fossil ivory found there. Off the E. coast 22 out of the whole number (25) of the Kurile islands, which stretch away in a long line between Kamtchatka and Yesso, belong to Russia : these islands are highly vol cauic and contain 18 active craters. Saghalien, the long narrow isle which parts the Sea of Okhotsk from the Sea of Japan, belongs in part to Russia, the southern moiety being held by the Japanese, whose tenure appears, however, to be very uncertain : coal has been dis covered in the Russian portion. A large island has been seen off the N. coast, near Behring Strait, in 71\u00b0 \u2014 74\u00b0 N. lat., with a mountain on it 2480 ft. high. III. Turkestan. \u00a7 14. Boundaries \u2014 Natural Features \u2014 Climate and Pro ductions. \u2014 Turkestan is that portion of Central Asia which inter venes between the Caspian Sea in the W., and the ranges which bound the eastern plateau (Thian-shan and the Pamir highland) in the E. Towards the N. the region lies open to Siberia on both sides of the Sea of Aral ; towards the S. it is accessible from Persia, but is shut off from the greater part of Afghanistan as well as from the Punjab by the massive range of Hindoo Koosh. The name of Turkestan is applied to it from the predominance of the Turco- Tartar element in its population : it is usually called ' Independent ' Turkestan or Tartary, to distinguish it from Chinese Turkestan on the other side of the Pamir plateau. The title of Turan, occasionally applied to it, has the advantage of distinctiveness. The area is esti mated at 641,040 sq. m., and the population at 7,870,000."], [406, "Book II. 390 TURKESTAN. Natural Features. \u2014 Turkestan consists of two distinct regions :\u2014 (1) A vast depressed plain, stretching away S.W., S., and E., from the Sea of Aral, and ( 2 ) a mountainous and gradually elevated region in the E. : the division between these two lies between the G4th and 68th meridians. The mountain ranges are connected with Pamir and Thian-shan, which descend to the plain by a series of terraces, and break up into parallel ridges running generally E. and W. In the N.E. the lofty ranges of Kentchi-Alatau (14,000 ft.) inclose Lake Issik-kol on the N. with a double barrier. From the W. of this ema nates Kirghiznin-Alatau (15,000 ft.), a snowy range which separates the basins of the Chu and the Talas, and is continued S. of the Talas in two parallel ranges running towards the Sir-daria. The main range of Thian-shan, S. of Lake Issik-kol, is continued into Turkestan in the Kazikurt range, which ramifies over Kokan. More S. we may notice Ak-Tau and Fan-Tau, which enclose the Kohik valley above Samarcand. The plain is desert, except in such parts as are favoured by natural or artificial irrigation : the portion between the lower courses of the Amoo and Sir-daria is distinguished as the Desert of Kizil-Koom. The chief rivers of Turkestan are the Sir-daria and the Amoo, which rise on the verge of the Eastern plateau, the Sir-daria on Thian-shan, the Amoo on the Pamir highland, and descend in parallel lines to the Sea of Aral. Both of these rivers divide and subdivide in their lower courses, and the Amoo is extensively used for irrigation about Khiva : both are navigable in their lower and mid-courses ; but shifting sand banks render the Amoo very difficult to navigate. Several of the minor rivers are wholly absorbed by the desert : this is particularly the case with the Kohik or Zar-afshan, the river of the valley of Sogd, in which the important towns of Samarcand and Bokhara are situ ated ; and again with the Murghauh. on the border of Afghanistan. The Sea of Aral is shallow along the E. coast, deep with precipitous banks along the W. ; the N.E. end (Little Aral) is shut off from Great Aral by islands : there are only 3 harbours throughout the whole extent of its eoast, and 2 on Nicholas Island. The Russians keep a steam flotilla on it. In regard to climate, the plain is distinguished by its excessive summer heat, and by the violent hurricanes (called Tebbad) which occasionally sweep across it, carrying columns of sand : the winters are temperate. The soil, where irrigated, produces every kind of fruit and vegetable ; the grapes, pomegranates, melons, and apricots are particularly fine. Millet and rice are cultivated, in addition to the ordinary cereals. Silk and cotton are among the more important products of this region. The highlands supply abundant pasture for the black goats of Bokhara, the black sheep of Pamir, and other animals. The horses of Turkestan are of excellent quality. Coal has been found in the Kara-tau range, and there are rich silver-mines in the Ala-tau range N. of Kokan. \u00a7 15. Inhabitants \u2014 Political Divisions \u2014 Towns. \u2014 Turkestan is occupied by a heterogeneous population, belonging chiefly to the Tartar race. The Usbeoks may be regarded as the dominant tribe, inasmuch as they hold office in the large commercial cities, such as Bokhara and Khiva. The Tajiks of Bokhara and the Sartes of Khiva (the same people under different appellations) are the most active traders: they speak a Persian language, and are supposed to be descended from the ancient Sogdians. Turkomans, to the num-"], [407, "Chap. XVII. INHABITANTS, TRADE, ETC. 391 her of 770,000, roam over the deserts between the Caspian Sea and Aral ; and a kindred tribe, the Kara-Kalpaks, are found E. of Aral. The eastern highlands are tenanted by Kirghizes. Arabs, Jews, and Persians are found in the towns. Mohammedanism is the prevalent religion, and the fanatical zeal of the people seals up the country against Europeans. Manufactures, Commerce, &c. \u2014 The manufactures carried on in Tur kestan consist of cotton and silk stuffs, leather (particularly shagreen1, paper made of raw silk, carpets, and weapons. The commerce is carried on chiefly with Russia, whence are imported hardware, raw iron, cutlery, and cotton goods. To Persia are sent lambs' wool, dried fruit, and dyes, in return for which Turkestan receives opium, sugar, and cutlery. The trade is carried on by caravans with Orenburg in Russia, and Meshed in Persia ; and, on a smaller scale, from Kokan over the Terek Pass with Kashgar and Central Asia. Political Divisions. \u2014 The political divisions are of a very indefinite order: the chief towns are the seats of native dynasties, which extend their sway over the surrounding districts. The independence of these dynasties is seriously threatened by the Russians, who have established themselves at Tashkend, and have carried their arms even to the neigh bourhood of Samarcand.1 The most important state is Bokhara, which holds sway over the valley of Sogd, the mid basin of the Amoo, and the desert of Kizil-Koom ; its area has been estimated at 230,000 sq. m., and its population at 2-J millions. Kokan formerly held supremacy along the whole course of the Sir-daria, but its influence must now be restricted to the mountainous district surrounding the upper basin of that river. Khiva rules over the region of the lower Amoo and the desert S. of the Sea of Aral, with an estimated population of 1^ million. Kunduz is an independent state between the upper Amoo and the Hindoo Koosh : it includes Badakshan, a highland district in the angle between Hindoo Koosh and Pamir. Maimana, on the border of Afghanistan, appears to be the seat of an entirely independent dynasty. Towns. \u2014 The towns are poor and dilapidated : the citadels, colleges, and mosques are the public buildings most worthy of notice. Bokhara (160,000) stands near the Zar-afshan, whence it derives its supplies of water : it is the seat of a Mohammedan university, and possesses 360 mosques. Samarcand (20,000), in the same valley, is the \" Holy City \" of Turkestan, and is famous for the relics of Timour's magnificence, his summer palace, mosque, citadel, and sepulchre : there are nu merous colleges, but most of them are in ruins. Khiva (12,000) lies near the Amoo, amidst well-watered gardens and fields. Kokan, near the Sir-daria, is the first town of importance on the route that leads from Cashgar to Russia : it was captured by the Russians in 1 864. Tashkend (90,000), is the key of the valley of the Sir-daria, and an advanced post of the Russians. Balkh, the ancient Bactra, on a river of the same name which joins the Amoo, retains but little of its former greatness. Maimana, on the route between Balkh and Herat, and Merv, on the direct route between Bokhara and Herat, in the fertile valley of the Murghaub, are important caravan-stations. 1 Tbe probable advance of the Kussian frontier from the Sir-daria to the Amoo is viewed with uneasiness by a large section of the Anglo-Indian community. From Bokhara the way to Afghanistan and tho valley of the Indus lies open by Herat, which may be reached either by Merv or by Balkh."], [408, "392 Toot; I Baghdad. CHAPTER XVIII.

Extent \u2014 Divisions \u2014 Area and Population. \u2014 Turkey in Asia embraces that portion of the continent which lies between the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, and the Persian Gulf, together with a somewhat indefinite section of N. Arabia. On the E. it adjoins Persia aud the Trans-Caucasian provinces of Eussia : the three empires meet at Mt. Ararat, which thus serves as a huge boundary- pillar between them. To the N. of Ararat an irregular line strikes across to the Black Sea in 41\" 45' N. lat. ; to the S. the boundary follows the outer edge of the Iranian plateau until it approaches the river Kerkhah, where it descends to the plain aud strikes the 1. bank of the Shatt-el-Arab. The geographical regions included within these"], [409, "Chap. XVIII. ASIA MINOR. 393 limits are :\u2014 (1) The Anatolian plateau. (2) Part of the Arme nian plateau, and the ranges of Zagrus. (3) The plain of the Euphrates and Tigris. (4) The highland of Palestine, and the chain of Lebanon. (5) A portion of the Arabian peninsula. The political regions are four, the third of which includes the third and fourth of the above geographical regions. Their names, areas, and populations are as follow : \u2014 With regard to these extensive possessions of the Ottoman Empire, it may be said generally that their natural resources are unbounded, and their position and natural conformation sufficiently favourable for bringing them into commercial relations with Europe ; but all their advantages are thrown away under the present government. Roads are almost unknown : the routes are generally tracks without bridges : the rivers are unnavigable for want of a little expenditure on canalization : life and property are insecure : banking and postal ar rangements are required ; in short, the whole state of this fine country is backward and wretched to a degree. \u00a7 2. Asia Minor \u2014 its Boundaries \u2014 Natural Features \u2014 Climate and Productions. \u2014 Asia Minor is a name borrowed from ancient geography to describe the western or Anatolian peninsula, which protrudes westward from the body of the continent between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean to the Archipelago and the Sea of Marmara. The Euphrates forms its E. limit between 37\u00b0 20' and 39\u00b0 20' N. lat. ; to the N. of which section the boundary strikes across to the maritime range of the Black Sea, while to the S. the line is carried to the head of the Gulf of Iskenderun. This peninsula is the most westerly portion of the belt of plateaus which crosses the Asiatic continent. The ranges of Taurus in the S. and of Anti- Taurus in the E. form its supporting buttresses, and elevate it in these directions, so that the general slope of the country is towards the N. and W., the largest rivers seeking the Black Sea, as the Kizil- Irmak, the Sakaria, and the Yeshil-Irmak, while a second group of less size flows W. to the Archipelago through the parallel valleys into which the plateau there breaks up. Extensive upland plains occur in the interior, many of which are shut off from the river-basins and dispose of their drainage in lakes without outlets. The coasts vary in character : the northern is regular ; the western, broken up with deep inlets and bold promontories ; and the southern, generally s3 Division. Area in sq. m. Population.

Book II. hi\" h and rock-bound. The climate is variable : the high plains of the interior are exposed to severe cold in winter, and the maritime plains of the S. and W. are too hot in summer. The W. coast is liable to earthquakes. The natural capabilities of the country are great but undeveloped : the western districts are the best cultivated, and produce opium, olives, silk, madder, and some cotton. The interior uplands are devoted to grazing, and the flocks of sheep and goats yield a remarkably fine wool. Coal-mines are worked at Bender-Erekli, 90 m. E. of the Bosporus, and at Nazli, 80 m. from Ephesus. We add some particulars as to the natural features. Coasts and Harbours. \u2014 The leading feature on the N. coast is the central projection which terminates in C. Injeh. Open roadsteads are numerous on this coast, but sheltered and capacious harbours are rare : the only frequented ports are Samsun, Trehizond and Batum. the first capable of being made a first-rate harbour, the two others indifferent. The Sea of Marmara has two bays on its E. coast, named after the towns of Ismid and Mundania : on the latter are the ports of Mundania, which serves the important town of Brusa, and Ghio or Ghemlik, which shares in the same business, and is the seat of a government dockyard : further W., on the same coast, is the frequented but exposed port of Panorma. The coast of the \u00c6g\u00e6an Sea or Archipelago is fretted with inlets, of which we may enumerate from N. to S. the Gulfs of Adramyti, Sandarlik, Smyrna, Scala Nova, Mandelyah, Cos, and Symi, with the promontories of C. Baba, Kara-Bournu. St. Mary, and Krio. Smyrna is the leading port of this coast and indeed of all Asia Minor ; its harbour is deep, roomy, and sheltered : the only railroads in the country lead inland from this point ; and the products of the surrounding soil are valuable. S. of Smyrna is the port of Scala Nova. The southern coast has in its central part the extensive Gulf of Adalia, bounded by the promontories of Khelidonia and Ana- mur ; and at its E. extremity the Gulf of Iskenderun, W. of which is the maritime plain of Tarsus. The ports are poor, the chief one being Adalia or Sataliah, at the head of the Gulf of that name. Mountains. \u2014 The range of Taurus may be considered to commence on the rt. bank of the Euphrates, j ust below the confluence of the Tochma- Su in 38\u00b0 35' N. lat. Thence it stretches W. to the Jihun, its loftiest point in this section being Akjah-Tagh. Crossing the Sihun, which bursts through it by a deep gorge, it assumes various local names, such as Bulghar-Tagh and Allah-Tagh. The culminating point of tbe range is Metdesis in Cilicia, about 11,725 ft. The eastern range or Anti- Taurus takes up the line of Taurus N. of the Tochma-Su, and proceeds N.E. to a junction with the western limbs of Ararat. Various ranges .and isolated mountains rise out of the plateau, among which we may notice Arjish-Tagh (13,197 ft.), with its twin conical peaks, near Kaisariyeh, Gok-Tagh (\"the Bithynian Olympus) W. of the river Sakaria, aud Keshish-Tagh (the Mysian Olympus) near the Brusa. Rivers. \u2014 The Kizil- Irmak or \" Red River,\" the ancient Halys, rises on the western spurs of Anti-Taurus, and flows S.W. to near Arjish- Tagh, then curves round until it attains a N.E. direction, which it pre- serves with variations until it reaches the Black Sea: its course is generally swift, and its name refers to the colour of the sediment it carries down. The Sakaria lies W. and the Yeshil-Irmak E. of the"], [411, "Chap. XVIII. INHABITANTS, TOWNS, ETC. 395 Kizil-Irmak. On the W. coast the Kodus-Chai (Hermus) and the Men dere (Meander), may be noticed, the former joining the Gulf of Smyrna, and the latter reaching the sea between the Gulfs of Scala Nova and Mandelyah. On the S. coast the rivers are generally short in consequence of the proximity of Taurus : the chief exceptions are the Jihun aud Sihun, which pierce the range of eastern Taurus by wild and precipitous ravines, and finally cross the alluvial plain of Tarsus. Of the lakes the most noticeable are : the Tuz-Gol or Great Salt Lake, lying W. of the Kizil-Irmak, at an elevation of 3550 ft., and covering an area of 175 sq. m., fed by the Beas-Su, and having no outlet ; Bey- Shehr, N. of the Gulf of Adalia, at an elevation of 4000 ft., a fresh water lake without any outlet ; and Egerdir, to the N.W., which has the same character. \u00a7 3. Inhabitants \u2014 Political Divisions \u2014 Towns \u2014 Communica tions \u2014 Islands. \u2014 The population of Asia Minor consists of Greeks, Turks, and Turcomans, the two first in the towns and agricultural districts of the coast, and the third on the table-lands of the interior, where they lead a nomadic life with their flocks and herds. The territorial divisions usually recognized are as follow : \u2014 Anatolia (from a Greek word signifying \" the east \" ), the region W. of the Kizil-Irmak ; Boom (the usual designation of the Turks for all the districts wrested from the Romans), the district immediately E. of the Kizil-Irmak, and otherwise termed Sivas after its capital ; Kara mania (named after a medieval potentate, Karaman), between the Gulf of Adalia and the Kizil-Irmak ; Adana or Itshili, between Taurus and the Mediterranean, answering to the ancient Cilicia; and Trebizond, on the S.E. coast of the Black Sea. For administra tive purposes the Turks divide the country into 8 eyalets, 4 of which are included in Anatolia, viz. : Aidin, Khowdavendguiar, Kastamuni, and Bozok, their capitals being respectively Smyrna, Brusa, Kastamuni, and Angdra : the remaining 4 correspond to the other territorial divisions, the capitals being Sivas, Koniyeh (Kara mania), Adana, and Trebizond. Towns. \u2014 The towns of Asia Minor derive their chief interest from ancient associations : their present condition is one generally of decay and squalor. Smyrna stands first in population (150,000) and com mercial importance : its port has been already noticed ; the town itself has some good buildings facing the quays : it has suffered much from earthquakes and fire. Brusa (60,00u) is the most flourishing of the inland cities, and is comparatively well built : it was the capital of the house of Osman from 1356 to 1306. Scutari (60,000), on the Bosporus, may be regarded as a suburb of Constantinople, and will be remem bered as the seat of the British military hospital during the Crimean war. Kutaya (50,000) is an important place in the centre of Anatolia, of which it is usually regarded as the capital. Angora (15,200), on an eastern branch of the Sakaria, is the dep6t for the wool of the Angora goat, and the stuffs manufactured from it : near it are the remains, almost perfect, of the Temple of Augustus, containing the famous in scription designated the Marmor Ancyranum. Sivas (25,000) and"], [412, "396 TURKEY IN ASIA. Book II. Tokat (35,000) are the chief towns in the interior of Roum, Sivas near the Kizil-Irmak, Tokat more N. on the Yeshil-Irmak, with silk, calico, and copper-refining establishments. The ports of Samsun and Trebi zond 45,000) have been already noticed : the latter is the place of ship ment for the traffic of Armenia and Persia by way of Erzroum. Eaisa riyeh (10,000 1, near Mt. Arjish, is a place of commerce with Syria and Armenia, aud receives a considerable amount of European goods to exchange for native produce. Koniyeh (50,0u0) the ancient Iconium, is the capital of Karamania, and the centre of various commercial routes : it was the capital of the Seljukian Turks from about 1075 to 1294, and contains many remains of Saracenic architecture dating from the period preceding the Seljukian dynasty. Adana (20,000), and Tarsus (with a shifting population which occasionally reaches 30,000), are the chief towns of the S.E. maritime district. Among the places of antiquarian interest we may specify Budrum (the ancient Halicarnassus) which has yielded the valuable remains now deposited in the British Museum. To the Biblical student Asia Minor has a special interest as the scene of St. Paul's missionary travels and the seat of the 7 churches noticed in the Book of Revelation. Communications. \u2014 Under this head we have only to notice the two railroads constructed with British capital from Smyrna to Cassaba, and from Smyrna to Aidin : the first carries down the products of the upper valley of the Kodus-Chai, and the other taps the commerce of the rich valley of the Mendere. Islands.\u2014 Cyprus, the most important island in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean, lies about 60 m. S. of Asia Minor, and has a length of 110 m. from E. to W., an extreme breadth of about 50 m., an esti mated area of 4500 sq. m., and a population of 108,000. Two parallel ranges of mountains traverse it, one of which skirts the N. coast and runs out into the long peninsula terminating in C. St. Andrea, while the other, containing the culminating height of Santa Croce, lies more to the S. A plain, watered by the river Fedia, occupies the interval between them. The soil is rich, and the island abounds with valuable products ; but under Turkish rule the population has dwindled, and much of the island has reverted to a state of nature. Two-thirds of the population are Greeks, the remainder chiefly Turks. Lefkosia or Nicosia, in the central plain, ranks as the capital, and Larnica on the S. coast is the most active place of business and the chief port, though far inferior in capacity to the old port of Famagousta more to the E. Rhodes lies off the S.W. angle of Asia Minor, 13 m. distant from C. Alepo, having a length of 46 in., an extreme breadth of 18 m\u201e an area of 420 sq. in., and an estimated population of 30,000. A well-wooded mountain range traverses it in the direction of its length from N.E. to S.W. The soil is of great fertility, and the climate charming. About one-fourth of the inhabitants are Turks, and the remainder Jews and Greeks. The capital, Rhodes, is situated at the N. extremity of the island and still retains the walls and the hospital of the Knights of St. John, who held the island from 1308 to 1522. The remaining islands belonging to Turkey from S. to N. are : \u2014 Cos or Stancho ; Nicaria ; Fatmos ; Samos, a remarkably fertile spot, yield ing corn and wine for export, and possessing marble, iron, lead, and emery; Scio, also very fertile, aud until 1822 very prosperous, but since the massacre consequent upon the revolt in that year, a down stricken and decayiug place ; Mytilene (the ancient Lesbos) the largest of all these islands, beautiful, well-wooded, and naturally fertile, but."], [413, "ARMENIA AND KURDISTAN. 397 Ciur.

Armenia and Kurdistan. \u2014 This division of Asiatic Turkey includes so much of the Ar menian highlands as belong to Turkey (the remainder being divided between Rus sia and Persia) together with the mountainous region se parating the plateau of Iran from the plain of Mesopo tamia as far S. as the river Shirwan. On the N., Ar nienia is considered to ad vance to the maritime range that fringes the Black Sea, even if it does not descend to the shore of the sea in the extreme northern dis trict of Guriel : the Arpa chai marks the limit be tween Turkish and Russian Armenia, and Ararat has been already noticed as the boundary-pillar farther S. l.Ul.l:.. Natural Features \u2014 Climate and Productions. \u2014 The whole of this region is a highland, sometimes rising to lofty and rugged mountains, such as Ararat, with its twin peaks Aghri-Tagh (16,964 ft.) and Allah-Tagh ; Sipan Tagh, N. of Lake Van ; and Bin-gol-Tagh the \" mountain of a thousand streams,\" which divides the basins of the Murad-su and Kara-su; and elsewhere spreading out into elevated plains, such as those which surround Erzroum and Mush, which stand at elevations of about 6000 ft. and 5000 ft. respectively, and the basin that surrounds Lake Van, 5462 ft. above the sea. The waters from these highlands flow partly to the Caspian through the Aras, partly to the Black Sea through the Tchoruk-su, but mainly to the Persian Gulf through the Euphrates aud Tigris, which take their sources in Armenia, the Euphrates traversing the central highlands in two branches, the Murad-su or eastern branch from the N. of Lake Van, and the Kara-su or western branch from the neighbourhood of Erzroum, while the Tigris rises more S. aud receives numerous affluents from the Kurdish mountains, of which we may notice the Bitlis, and the two Zabs (Great and Little). The large lake of Van (1414 sq. m.) is situated in an angle between tho basins of the Tigris and Upper Euphrates, but is cut off by lofty mountains from these rivers. The climate of the uplands is very severe, and the plains are bare and only suited to pasturage. The sheltered valleys and lower plains produce grain in abundance, and the vine and melon ripen. Fine forests clothe the slopes of the mountain ranges. Minerals are scarce, but Kurdistan produces lead and orpiment."], [414, "398 TURKEY IN ASIA. Book II. Inhabitants \u2014 Political Divisions \u2014 Towns, &c\u2014 The inhabitants of Armenia and Kurdistan are chiefly Kurds, a nomad race of wild and lawless habits, living for the most part in tents and only resorting to the villages for shelter in the winter. In Kurdistan some of the Kurds profess the Christian faith, inherited from the old Nestorians : but the majority are Mohammedans. The Armenians are remarkably addicted to commerce and are found in all parts of Western Asia : in Armenia itself they now form only about l-7th part of the population, and are engaged partly in agriculture and partly in commerce. They form an independent Christian Church professing the Monophysite tenets. Tur komans are found on the northern plains, and Arabs in the valley of the Tigris. The region is divided into the eyalets of Erzroum, Kur distan, and Khabrout ; with Erzroum, Diarbekr, and Kharput for their respective capitals. Erzroum (40,000) is centrally situated on one of tbe highest plains of Armenia, and is an entrepot for the large com merce between Persia and the Black Sea. Diarbekr (14,000) stands on the Tigris, and is the seat of tanneries, silk, and cotton manufactures, and a general trade. Kharput is a place of no importance in the valley of the Euphrates. We may further notice Kars (12,000), a strong fortress near the Russian frontier, nobly defended in the Crimean war by the Turks under Sir Fenwick Williams ; and Van (15,000) a fortified town on the lake of the same name, with an active trade and some interesting cuneiform inscriptions. \u00a7 5. Mesopotamia. \u2014 Mesopotamia is the classical name for the plain of the Euphrates and Tigris, which extends from the moun tains of Armenia (Mardin Tagh) in the N. to the Persian Gulf in the S., and from the lower ranges of Zagrus in the E. to the Syrian table-land in the W. The bulk of the plain is contained between these two rivers, and is divided into two parts by the convergence of the rivers below Baghdad, the upper and larger portion being termed by the Turks Al-Jezireh \" the island,\" and the lower portion Irak-Arabi. Natural Features \u2014 Climate and Productions. \u2014 The plain presents to the eye an appearance of remarkable uniformity, interrupted in the N. by occasional low ranges such as the Sinjar hills W. of Mosul, and in the S. only by the vast mounds which cover the sites of the ancient cities. The Euphrates approximates to the Mediterranean at the N.W. angle of the plain, and thence pursues a S.E. course, receiving the Khahur, which conveys to it the drainage of the Mardin and Sinjar hills. The Tigris has a more direct S. course ; consequently the two rivers con verge near Baghdad, and finally unite at Korna to form the Shatt-el- Arab, which continues its course for 120 miles to the Persian Gulf: the Tigris receives numerous affluents on its 1. bank from the Kurdish hills, and the Shatt-el-Arab is enlarged by the waters of the Kerkhah and the Karoon. Both the Tigris and Euphrates are navigable for steamers, the former to about 50 m. above Baghdad, the latter to Bir, opposite the Gulf of Iskenderun ; but the traffic of the country is conducted on old fashioned rafts, which float lazily down the streams. Near Baghdad the rivers are united by the Saklawiyeh canal. W. of the lower Euphrates extensive marshes occur, and between the two rivers a considerable lake is formed by the river Tharthar at a point about 70 m. N.W. of Baghdad The climate is intensely hot in the summer, and the pesti-"], [415, "Chap. XVIII.

Rain falls copiously iu autumn, and thunder-storms are frequent in spring. The plain i3 generally a bare desert, but after rain it is clothed with a luxurious herbage, and sustains vast numbers of sheep and cattle. Wherever irrigation is practised, its fertility is unbounded, but it is only about the villages that the land is cultivated. Wool is the most valuable product, the fleeces of the flocks on the plains being of fine quality. halt on the Tigris. Inhabitants \u2014 Political Divisions and Towns. \u2014 The Mesopotamian plain is visited by nomad tribes of Arabs aud Kurds during the season of pasturage, the Arabs being most numerous in the central and southern regions. The Turks and Armenians restrict themselves to the towns and villages. The country is divided into two eyalets named after their respective capitals Mosul and Baghdad. Baghdad (65,000) may be regarded as the capital of the plain : it is advanta geously situated on the Tigris near the point of its approximation to the Euphrates ; it is fortified after the fashion of Eastern towns, and has a bridge of boats to connect the portions on the opposite sides of the Tigris : it haa manufactures of leather, silk, and cotton, and is a commercial mart between Damascus and Persia. It was founded in 763, and was the seat of the khalifate until 1259, when it was captured by the Tartars : after various fortunes it became permanently subject to the Turks in 1638. Mosul (30,000) is seated on the Tigris 216 m. N.W. of Baghdad, and is an entrepot between that town and Diarbekr : the word \"muslin \" comes to us through the French mousseline from Mosul, which was formerly the chief mart for the export of this manu facture : Christians are numerous in this place, which is the seat of a Jacobite (Monophysite) patriarchate. Bassora ( 00, 000), on the Shatt-el- Arab, 70 m. above its mouth, is accessible to vessels of 500 tons, and is the port for Indian commerce. Orfah (30,000) in the N.W., and in cluded in the eyalet of Kurdistan, is a place of large trade, and has a very fine mosque : it was the seat of a Christian principality at the period of the Crusades. The remains of antiquity iu Mesopotamia are"], [416, "400 TURKEY IN ASIA. Book II. very interesting : near Mosul the mounds of Nimroud, Khorsabad, and Khouyunjik represent the cluster of cities of which Nineveh was tlie chief \u2022 near Hillah are the ruins of ancient Babylon ; and farther S. are the mounds of Niffer, Warka, Senkereh, and Mugheir. The first of these grouDS yielded the invaluable monuments now deposited in the British Museum. \u00a7 6. Stria \u2014 its Position \u2014 Natural Features \u2014 Climate and Productions. \u2014 Syria or Es-Scham (i.e., the country on the left hand to an inhabitant of Mecca as he faces the E.) occupies the region between the Mediterranean on the W., the low plain of the Eu phrates in the N.E., and the Arabian Desert on the S.E. and S. It contains 3 geographical divisions : \u2014 (1) A mountainous belt running parallel to the Mediterranean. (2) A narrow maritime plain be tween the mountains and the sea. (3) A broad expanse of desert table-land between the mountains and the plain of the Euphrates. (1) The mountainous belt is connected with Taurus at the head of the Gulf of Iskenderun by the lofty chain of Jawur-Tagh (the ancient Amanus), which is continued in Akma-Tagh, the dip between these sections furnishing the only practicable route between Cilicia and Syria by the grand Pass of Beilan. At the valley of the Ahsy the continuity of the mountain-belt is broken ; but S. of that river the line is resumed in the crest range of Jebel-Kraad and continues S. under various local titles until it rises to the majestic barrier-range of Lebanon, where it culminates in Dhor-el-Chotib (10,061 ft.) S.E. of Tripoli. The breadth of the belt is here increased by the parallel range of Jehel-esh-Shurky (Antilibanus), which faces Lebanon on the other side of the valley of the Litany | El-Bekaa and terminates S. in the advanced post of Jehel esh-Shetkh or Hermon (9383 ft.). The mountain belt subsides into the highlands of Palestine, the two divisions of which, E. and W. of the Jordan, correspond to the parallel ranges just noticed. (2) The maritime plain is broken up into numerous sections by the projecting spurs of the main range, which occasionally descend to the coast and form striking promontories, such as Ras-el-Khanzir at the termiuation of Akma-Tagh, Ras-Khanziri, N. of Latakia, and Jebel- Mar- Elias (Carmel), S. of Acre. The coast-line is sufficiently indented to supply harbours, but the Turkish goverumentthas not availed itself, as it might, of the natural advantages offered. On the Gulf of Isken derun Alexandretta, the port of Aleppo, has a protected aud safe road stead, but the place is malarious, and the sea is gradually receding from it. Beirout, the port of Damascus and of the Lebanon, has merely a roadstead, and this somewhat exposed ; aud the harbour of Jaffa, the port of Jerusalem, is silted up. Acre has a small and shallow, but well protected harbour : that of Tripoli is unsafe and incommodious ; Latakia, on the other hand, is safe but very small. (3) The eastern table-land presents few distinctive features : it is crossed in places by low ridges of hills, and elsewhere is varied by \" tells \" or hillocks, either natural or artificial. Rivers. \u2014 The rivers that pour down from the western face of the mountain-range are mere mountain-torrents, short, rapid, and capri cious. The two rivers which drain the hollow between Lebanon and Antilibanus have longer courses in the direction of the mountain-"], [417, "Chap. XVIII. 401 SYRIA. chain : they rise near each other on the plain of Bekaa, and flow in opposite directions, the Ahsy N., the Litany S., until they find outlets to the sea, the Ahsy at the depression N. of Jebel Kraad, and the Litany in the N. of Palestine. In Palestine the only river of import ance is the Jordan, which rises on the slopes of Hermon and descends through a remarkably depressed fissure between the highlands, feeding in its course the Bahr el-Huleh (Lake of Merom) and the Bahr-Tubariyeh or Sea of Galilee, lying respectively 120 ft. above and 653 ft. below the level of the sea, and terminating in the Bahr-Lut or Dead Sea, 46 m. long, 10 m. broad, and at a depression of 1316 ft. To the S. of this lake the level of the valley which leads to the Red Sea (the Wady-el- Arabah) gradually rises as far as the 30th parallel. In the eastern table-laud the waters gather into lakes and marshes : this is the case with the Koweik or river of Aleppo, and with the streams which fertilize the plain of Damascus, the Barada, the Helbon, and the Awaj. The Ahsy receives the discharge of a large lake, named Agha Denghiz or the Lake of Antioch. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The climate of Syria presents every gra dation of temperature from the perennial snows of Lebanon to the desolating heat of the depressed valley of the Jordan. The mean tem perature of Jerusalem in summer is 73\u00b0 8', in winter 49\u00b0 6'. Rain falls in spring and autumn, and snow is not uncommon in winter on the high lands of Palestine, though it does not lie there. The soil of the maritime plains is remarkably productive, and the eastern table-land only requires irrigation to convert it into a garden of fertility : the plains of Haouran (En-Nukrah) and of Damascus may be instanced in illustration of this. But generally the eastern region is a desert, yielding herbage only after rain. The slopes of the mountain-ranges are clothed with forests. The productions of the country are silk, which is largely cultivated in Lebanon, grain (wheat, barley, and dhurra), olive-oil, tobacco, some cotton, and fruit of various kinds, particularly the pomegranate, pistachio-nut, date, orange, and fig. \u00a7 7. Inhabitants and Towns. \u2014 The population of Syria is of a very heterogeneous character, hopelessly shattered by religious ani mosities. The Moslems, who form the most important element are a mixed race, and are divided into the two hostile sects of Sunnites and Shiites. Tbe Maronites who come next in number are numerous in Lebanon : they are Christians, who at one time pro fessed the Monothelitic creed, and derived their name from their founder, John Maron : they are probably descended from the old Syrians. The Druses, their neighbours and hereditary foes, are of Arab origin, and settled here in the llth century : their religion is a mysterious one, and their habits fierce and warlike. The Nusai riyeh occupy the mountains N. of Tripoli ; their origin and religious tenets are unknown. Besides the above there are Kurds in the N. ; a certain number of Ismailiyeh (the descendants of the \" Assassins\") ou the E. slope of Lebanon ; and a few Yezidees or Devil-worshippers. Arabs roam over all the open country, and about 25,000 Jews are scattered throughout the towns. Most of the inhabitants are agri culturists, and commerce is chiefly in the hands of the Jews and"], [418, "TURKEY IN ASIA. Book II. 402 Christians. The manufactures are confined to silk and cotton textures both plain and embroidered, leather-work, glass, and soap. The country is divided into the three eyalets of Haleb, Sa'ida, and Scham with Aleppo, Beirout, and Damascus for their respective capitals. These and a few other of the leading towns deserve a special notice, partly from their commercial importance, and partly from historical associations. J' I11>lJt Wi- Towns. \u2014 Damascus (150,000), the capital of Syria, occupies a charm ing site on the banks of the Barada, which is here distributed by artificial channels over the adjacent plain, and is the source of its extraordinary fertility and verdure. Drinking water is abundantly supplied from an other source, the Phege. The town is about 6 m. in circumference, and contains spacious and well-stocked bazaars, a castle, numerous mosques \u2014 among which the \" Great Mosque, \" once a Christian Church, is conspicuous for its size and beauty \u2014 and a fortified palace or \" serai, the residence of the governor. The private houses, mean outside, are beautiful inside, and highly ornamented with fountains, flowering shrubs, marble pavemeuts, &c. A large trade is done at Damascus, chiefly through Beirout, abuut 60 m. distant, with which it is connected by a good road formed by a French company. The manufactures con sist of cotton and silk stuffs, leather-work to a great extent, jewelry, and sabres, though its ancient fame for cutlery is not now maintained. The leading event in the year is the departure of the \" Great Hadj,\" or body of pilgrims to Mecca. Aleppo (70,900) stands on the Koweik, midway between the Mediterranean and the Euphrates. It was formerly a more populous town, its decay being due partly to the insecurity of the country aud partly to a terrible earthquake in 1822. It still carries on manufactures of embroidered silk, striped cotton, and gold and silver thread. Its trade is chiefly with Antakia and Iskenderun in the W.,"], [419, "Chap. XVIII. 403 SYRIA. and Baghdad in the E. Jerusalem, the El-Kuds, or \"holy city \" of the Arabs, stands on the highland of Palestine, between Jaffa, on the Medi terranean, and the Dead Sea. It is elevated 2660 feet above the Mediterranean, has a circumference of about 21 m., and a stationary population variously estimated at from 10,000 to 30,000. The form of the town is quadrangular: the site is still uneven, but the depressions that formerly divided the hills have been much filled up. The E. hill on which stood Solomon's Temple, is occupied by the Haram or sacred enclosure, a slightly irregular quadrangle 1520 feet long on its E. side, and 927 feet broad on the S., and containing the Kubbet es-Sakhrah, or \" Dome of the Rock,\" an octangular building surmounted by a massive dome aud covering the Sakhrah or Rock ; and the mosque of el-Aksa formerly a Christian Church. The Church of the Holy Sepul chre stands on the W. side of the town, as also does the Citadel a little to the S. of it. The population consists of Moslems, Christians, and Jews, each occupying a separate quarter, the Moslems being about half the whole amount, while the two others are about evenly balanced. The only manufactures of the place are soap and rosaries. Jerusalem was taken by the Crusaders in 1099, and recovered by Saladin in 1187, since which time the Turks have retained it with the exception of the 8 years that it was held by tbe Egyptians in 1832-40. Beirout (60,000) stands on the coast in 35\u00b0 54' N. lat. : it serves as the port of Damascus and the Lebanon, and is the chief seat of European commerce. Jaffa (25,000) is the port of Jerusalem and of all Southern Palestine : if the harbour were cleared out and a road constructed to Jerusalem, it would be a place of large trade : the steamers of various continental companies, French, Austrian, and Russian, touch there for passengers. Jaffa figures in the history of the Crusades, and was the scene of the faith less massacre of its garrison by Napoleon I. in 1 799. Acre, more fully St. Jean d'Acre, N. of Carmel, is a place of great natural strength, and has always been regarded as the key of Palestine : it was taken by Baldwin I. in 1104, by Saladin in 1187, by tbe Crusaders in 1191, by the Mamelukes in 1291 after it had been held for 62 years by the Christian Knights, by Ibrahim Pacha in 1832, and by the Anglo- Austrian fleet from the Egyptians in 1840: Napoleon I. failed in his attempt to storm it in 1799. Antakia (18,000), the representative of ancient Antioch, has suffered a series of disasters from earthquakes and war: the Crusaders captured it in 1089, and the Mamelukes in 1268 : it is now a poor town in a beautiful situation. Hamah (30,000) is an important inland town on tbe Ahsy. We may further notice Nabulus (8000), on the route from Jerusalem to the W., with soap works and oil of fine quality ; El-Khalil or Hebron (10,000), 16 m. S.W. of Jerusalem, surrounded by vineyards and olive-yards, and possessing the much-revered burial-place of Abraham; and Gaza (15,000), an im portant caravan station on the route to Egypt. The monastery of Mar Saba, between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, is perched on the summit and sides of a precipitous cliff. The monuments of antiquity in Syria are numerous, and include tbe fine remains of Palmyra or Tadmor, Baalbek or Heliopolis, and the harbour of Seleucia.

Boundaries, &c, Towns. \u2014 The peninsula of Arabia lies between 12\u00b0 40' and 34\u00b0 N. lat., 32\u00b0 3& and 60\u00b0 E. long., and is bounded E. by the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman, S. by the Arabian Sea, W. by the Eed Sea, and N. by Syria. Its area is esti mated at 1,219,748 sq. m., and the population at about 5 millions, the Turkish portion of the peninsula being included in these com putations. Natural Features. \u2014 Arabia consists o. 3 distinct regions : \u2014 (1) A low maritime plain (the Tehama), bounded by hills running parallel to the coast, sometimes in close proximity to it, elsewhere at varyiug distances of from 20 to 40 m., and in Oman even CO m. The bounding ranges are generally from 500 to 1000 ft. high, but in Oman reach 6000 ft. and upwards. (2) An interior highland (the Nejd , restricted in the proper sense of the term to the plateau of Jebel Toweyk, which extends across the peninsula in a crescent form, N.E. and S.W., between tho 20th and 27th parallels, and is intersected by numerous valleys, richly cultivated, and containing a settled population. The term is extended to other cultivated but less elevated districts to tbe N. of Jebel Toweyk, such as Kaseem and Jebel Shomer. (3) A zone of desert completely encircling the Nejd, and shutting it off from the Tehama. In the S. this desert is of vast extent, occupying the whole breadth of the penin sula between Oman and Yemen to the S. of the 23rd parallel : it is named Roba-el-Khali, and is hopelessly barren, containing only a few chains of small oases. The northern desert extends S. to El-Gawf, and though for the most uncultivated, is not so uncultivable as tha southern one, water being generally attainable. On the E. and W. of the Ne;d the desert belt is comparatively narrow, and consists o."], [421, "Chap. XVIII. CLIMATE, INHABITANTS, ETC. 405 offsets from the great southern desert. Lateral arms, termed by the Arabs nefoods or \"passes,\" project between the elevated districts of the central region, separating them from each other. In these, as in the great southern desert, the sand is immensely deep, and is generally disposed in wide uudulations with intervening crests or ridges : occa sionally, however, it is piled up in irregular dunes with labyrinthine hollows between them. The northern desert is not at a high elevation : it is crossed by the Wadi Sirhau, a valley about 250 ft. deep, which terminates at El-Gawf. In the S.W. angle of the peninsula the plateau breaks up into picturesque and well-watered valleys, which descend with varying elevation to the Tehama, and furnish the most fertile and pleasing portion of the peninsula. The peninsula of Sinai forms a dis tinct region, consisting of (1) a rugged kuot of mountains in the fork between the two arms of the Red Sea, with the culminating heights of Um-Shaumer (9300 ft.), Jebel-Katerin (8705 ft.), Jebel-Musa (the re puted Sinai), and Jebel-Serbal (6759 ft. | some 30 m. W. of the others : and (2; a desert table-land designated El-Tib, \" the Wandering,\" which stretches away from this mountain-knot to the border of Palestine. Climate and productions. \u2014 The characteristics of the climate of Arabia are aridity and intense heat. The year is divided into three seasons \u2014 winter, spring, and summer. In the Nejd the winters are severe, and fires are needed. The summer heat, on the other hand, is intense in almost all parts, but particularly on the maritime plain. Rain falls copiously iu the winter in all parts, and to the S. of the Tropic of Cancer the rainy season follows more or less the rule of the tropical regions. The rivers are seldom perennial : they flow during the rainy season, and afterwards dry up : their courses (wadys) supply the natural routes across the country. The watered valleys of the S.W. yield va rious cereals, particularly dhurra ; but the date is the most valuable bread-plant in this part of the world. Fine coffee is grown in the S.W., and is shipped from Mocha ; various drugs and gums of com mercial value are obtained from the shrubs and trees. The horse and camel are the most valuable domesticated animals. The pearl-oyster is found in the Persian Gulf about the Bahrein Islands. The locust supplies an article of diet to the poor. Minerals are scarce: in Oman lead-mines are worked, and there are iron-mines in Yemen. Inhabitants, Political Divisions, Towns, &c. \u2014 The Arabs are divided into two classes \u2014 dwellers in towns and dwellers in tents \u2014 in other words, settled Arabs and nomad Arabs. The latter are the well-known Bedawees or Bedouins, who form to our minds the true type of the Arab \u2014 independent, hospitable, rapacious, primitive, and loquacious, exhibiting to this day a patriarchal style of life and government. The settled Arabs are engaged in commerce and agriculture, and are go verned by rulers, entitled either \"Imaum\" or \"Sultan.\" All Arabs are Mohammedans, and are fierce and fanatical in their exclusion of other religionists. The political divisions are not clearly defined. The Turks hold a nominal sovereignty over the western district, which they divide into the two eyalets of Habesh and Haremi-Nahevi, with Jiddah and Medina for their respective seats of government. On the Nejd, the most important state is the great Wahabite empire, which includes tbe five central provinces of Sudeir, Wesehem, Aareidh, Yemama, and Aflaj, together with the outlying provinces of El-Ahsa on the highland skirting the Persian Gulf, Katif on the coast of the gulf, Kasim near Jebel Schammar, and Wadi Dowasir on the western side of the plateau about the 20th parallel, with Wadi Soleyyel and Hareek in the same"], [422, "406 PERSIA. Book II. direction. The capital of this kingdom is now at Riyad (24\u00b0 40' N. lat. 46\u00b0 20' E. long.). In the eastern angle between the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean is the state of Oman, with Muscat for its port : the Imaum of Oman has a respectable navy, and exercises great influence on the E. coast of Africa. In addition to these political divisions, we may notice the territorial titles of Hedjaz,1 applied to the re\u00b0ion which surrounds the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina ; Yemen, the \" South,\" the favoured district in the S.W. ; and Hadra mat, along the S. coast between Yemen and Oman. Of the towns, Mecca (45,000?) holds the first place as the \"holy city\" of the Mussul man world, the birthplace of Mohammed and the seat of the Kaabah, an enclosure about 770 ft. long, by 630 ft. broad, containing the famous \"Black Stone\" which all pilgrims kiss : an immense amount of business is done here at the time of the annual pilgrimage. Jiddah (22,000) serves as the port of Mecca, distant 70 m., and is the chief com mercial emporium on this coast. Medina (15,000) ranks as the second holy city, being the place where Mohammed died in 632, and was buried : it is 1 30 m. distant from Yambo, which serves as its port. The chief building in Medina is the Prophet's Mosque, consisting of an enclosure 420 ft. long and 340 broad, with the Hujrah, an irregular square of about 52 ft., in which are the reputed tombs of the Prophet, Abubekr, and Omar. Mocha (7000) is the port, and Sana (40,000) the capital, of Yemen, the latter standing on the plateau, 4000 ft. above the sea. Aden (20,000), on the Indian Ocean, belongs to Great Britain, and is valuable as a packet-station in connexion with the Indian route : it is about 100 m. from the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, and stands on a peninsula, the neck of which is strongly fortified, as are also the port and the town itself, situated in a volcanic crater 3 m. from the port. Muscat (50,000) is the commercial emporium of eastern Arabia, and has an excellent harbour. Bahrein, an island in the Persian Gulf, is the chief station of the pearl-fishery, which gives employment to 1500 vessels during the season. The small island of Perim, in the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, belongs to Great Britain. III. \u2014 Persia. \u00a7 9. Boundaries, Area, and Population \u2014 Natural Features \u2014 Climate, and Productions. \u2014 Persia occupies the western half of the Iranian plateau, and is bounded N. by the Aras and the Caspian Sea, W. by the outer range of Zagrus and the lower course of the Shatt-el-Arab, S. by the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Ormuz, and E. by an irregular boundary running W. of Lake Seistan. Its area is estimated at 562,327 sq. m., and its population at 5 millions, though the statements on this head differ widely. Natural Features. \u2014 The surface may be divided into three regions :\u2014 (1) The Great Salt Desert, which occupies the central and eastern parts. (2) The mountain zone which fringes this on the N., W., aud S. (3) The maritime plains skirting the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf. (1) The Great Salt Desert is generally flat and barren, the haunt 1 The name ' Hedjaz ' means the point qf junction between the Nejd and the Tehama."], [423, "Chap. XVIII. HYDROGRAPHY, CLIMATE, ETC. 407 of the wild ass and the gazelle; but wherever depressions occur, oases are formed, and these are sufficiently numerous to serve as stages for the caravan routes which cross it. (2) The mountainous region com prises the lofty range of Elburz, with the culminating height of Dema \\end (18,464 ft.), which still bears numerous proofs of its volcanic origin ; and the parallel ranges of Zagrus, which run from N.W. to S.E. and form a zone some 200 m. broad, running parallel to the Tigris, then skirting the Persian Gulf at a distance of 20 or 30 m., and finally subsiding into the Great Desert. (3) The maritime plains include the plain ou the shores of the Caspian, about 300 m. long, and varying in breadth from 5 m. to 30 m., a malarious, swampy, and very fertile region ; the plain between the mountains and the Shatt-el-Arab, which is mostly a sandy desert, but has pastures in its N.W. portion ; and the plain skirting the Persian Gulf, which is also barren. Rivers and Lakes. \u2014 The chief feature in the hydrography of Persia is the large amount of continental drainage on its surface. The only rivers whose waters reach the ocean are those which, rising on the southern face of the mountain zone, fall into the Persian Gulf, together with some few which course along the lateral valleys of the western region, such as the Kerkhah and the Karun, which join the Shatt-el- Arab. In the N. the Caspian Sea receives the Sefid Kud from the W. and the Attruck from the E. In the N.W. angle the large salt lake of Crumiah, with an area of 1735 sq. m., and lying at an elevation of 3860 ft., receives the drainage of a large district through the Aji, the Jagalty, and other rivers. On the inner face of the mountain zune the streams either gather into lakes or are absorbed by the sands of the Great Desert. Thus Lake Bakhtegan in the S. receives the Bendemir or \" Prince's Dyke,\" so called from a remarkable dyke thrown across it near Persepolis ; in the N. the Koom Rud and Kiveh, after their union, form a vast marsh S.E. of Teheran : the Zendeh, on the other hand, which flows by Ispahan, loses itself in the Desert. Climate and Productions \u2014 The climate of Persia is one of extremes. The summer heat of the low maritime plain on the shores of the Persian Gulf is intense : the winter cold of the central plateau is also in excess : the hilly district has a more moderate climate with a sufficiency of rain fall. The productiveness of the soil is strictly proportioned to the irri gation supplied to it. The systems of irrigation are rude : about Teheran water is obtained by digging pits at different levels, and connecting them by underground channels until the surface of the ground is gained. Luxuriant forests clothe the northern slopes of Elburz, but its southern slopes and nearly the whole of the plateau are devoid of wood. The valleys opening on to the sandy desert are mostly fertile, and so are the northern slopes of Elburz and the plain of the Caspian Sea. Rice and other cereals are produced in these districts ; but Persia is more celebrated for fruit than for grain : the date palm attains perfection on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and melons, pomegranates, the vine, and most of the fruits familiar to us in Europe grow there. Various drugs, particularly assaf\u0153tida, come from Persia. i he horses and asses are of a superior kind, and the broad-tailed sheep is indigenous. The silkworm is largely cultivated in the northern pro vinces. Of the minerals little is known : the turquoise mines near Nishapoor are celebrated. \u00a7 10. Inhabitants \u2014 Political Divisions, and Towns.\u2014 The"], [424, "408 PERSIA. Book H. population of Persia is partly settled and partly nomadic.1 The proportions that these bear to each other, as well as the number of each, are points on which the most diverse statements are put forth. The most reliable estimate of the nomadic population represents the number of tents as 400,000, and the number of persons, at the rate of 5 to each tent, as 2,000,000. The settled population is variously supposed to be equal to or the double of the nomadic. The Persians are a mixed race, chiefly of Mongol extraction, who speak an Indo- European tongue. Arabs abound on the shores of the Persian Gulf and on the plain of the Tigris, and Kurds occupy the western valleys opening into Mesopotamia. The inhabitants of Ghilan and Mazan deran use peculiar languages ; and in Astrabad Turcomans are nu merous. The Persians are handsome, courteous, and dignified in their bearing ; intelligent, but not well educated ; rapacious and untruthful. Religion, Government, and Commerce. \u2014 The Persians are Moham- medans of the Sheah sect, and are therefore held in abomination by the Turks and Arabs. Christianity is represented by the Nestorians about lake Urumiah and the wandering Armenians : Parsees or fire- worshippers are found in Yezd and the desert oases. The govern- ment is an autocracy, the title of the sovereign being \"Shah:\" his authority over the nomads is little more than nominal. Agriculture and pastoral pursuits are the chief occupations. The internal com- merce is considerable, and is prosecuted chiefly by caravans. Yezd, E. of Ispahan, is the commercial centre of the Great Desert, whence routes ramify to Bokhara, Afghanistan, and Beloochistan. European goods are imported, and cotton, silk, wool, and other raw produce exported. Political Divisions, and Towns. \u2014 Persia is divided into 11 provinces, of which 3 skirt the Caspian Sea, Mazanderan in the centre, Ghilan W., and Astrabad E. ; 3 are disposed along the western frontier from N. to S. in the following order, Azerbij&n, Irak-Ajemi (which includes Persian Kurdistan, Ardelan, and Luristan), and Khuzistan (a modified form of the ancient Susiana) : 2 are on the Persian Gulf from W. to E., Fars or Farsistan, a modified form of the ancient Penis, and Larist&n ; and 3 in the Great Desert, Kerman in the S., Yezd in the centre, and Khorassan in the N. The towns call for little notice : they are generally large in point of area and thinly populated, with gardens and groves in terspersed. Many have suffered severely from war and earthquakes, and of some only the ruins remain, as Alamut, the capital of the Assassins, N.W. of Teheran, and Shapur, in Farsistan, the capital of the Sassanides. Teheran (80,000), the capital since 1798, stands on a bare plain, about 8 m. S. ofthe Elburz range. Ispahan (60,000), the former capital, is more favourably situated in all respects on the banks of the Zendeh, where that river emerges from the hills on to the plain : it contains 1 The nomads are generically termed Ilyats, as distinct from the Persians proper or Tajiks, who form the bulk of the settled population. The term Tajik means sub jected or subdued. Ti e Ilyats are foimd in the large towns, and have in many places dropped their nomadic customs. The Kajar or reigning dynasty, comes of this branch of the population."], [425, "Chap. XVIIs. 409 BELOOCHISTAN. some very fine bazaars and caravanserais. Tabriz (100,000), in the basin of lake Urumiah, is the chief town in the N.W., and the entrepot of commerce with Russia. Bushire (18,000) is the leading port for foreign commerce on the Persian Gulf : it was taken by the British in 1856. Shiraz, in Farsistan, has lost much of its ancient splendour through earthquakes : it was the capital of the Caliphs, and flourished especially in the 13th and 14th centuries : near it are the tombs of the poets Hafiz (died 1388) and Saadi : wine, attar of roses, and rose water, are its most famous manufactures. Meshed (100,000) is the most important place in the direction of Turkestan, and contains a much-revered shrine which is visited by a large number of pilgrims. The chief towns in the maritime region of the Caspian are situated some few miles from the coast, as Balfrush, Saree, Amol, Reshd, and Asterabad, and have ports or roadsteads at which the Russian steamers call. We may further notice Hamadan, an entrepot on the route between Ispahan and Tabriz ; Kasbin, on the route between Teheran and Ghilan ; Kashan, between Teheran and Ispahan ; Dizful, the chief town of Khuzistan ; Lar and Kerman, the capitals of Laristan and Kerman; and Mohammerah, near the Shatt-el-Arab, taken by the British in 1857. Among the remains of antiquity we may notice the ruins of Susa near Shuster ; the interesting ruins of Persepolis, now known as the Chel-Minar or \" forty columns ;\" the tomb of Cyrus at Murghab, the ancient Pasargad\u00e6 ; aud the rock inscriptions at Behistun and other places. Islands.\u2014 Karak, N.W. of Bushire, is a valuable post as commanding the head of the Persian Gulf ; hence occupied by the British in the operations of 1856-7. Kishm, at the entrance of the Strait of Ormuz, belongs to the Imaum of Oman. IV. \u2014 Beloochistan. \u00a7 11. Boundaries, &c. \u2014 Towns. \u2014 Beloochistan occupies the S.E. portion of the Iranian plateau, together with the maritime plain of the Arabian Sea from the Persian boundary in the W. to C. Monze in the E. Its natural limit on the side of India is the Hala range, situated in about 67\u00b0 E. long. ; but it crosses the northern part of this range so as to include Cutch Gundava, which adjoins Scinde. The area of Beloochistan is estimated at about 166,000 sq. m., and the population at 2,000,000. Natural Features. \u2014 The north-western portion of Beloochistan con sists of a rugged and barren plateau, of which little is known : the north-eastern quarter is traversed by parallel ranges running N. and S., between which a few streams thread their way to the Indus and lead up to the passes by which the interior can be gained from India, such as the famous Bolan Pass between Dadur and Quettah, 59 m. long, and attaining an altitude of 5800 ft., and the Gundava Pass more to the S. The southern portion of the country consists of a series of ter races descending to the sea-coast, and separated from each other by parallel ranges, of which the Washutee or Match is the most important. The climate runs into extremes of heat on the maritime plain and of cold in the high mountainous districts ; aridity is a general characteristic, MOD. qeo.

The environs of the towns are alone cultivated. The Bolan Pass. Inhabitants, Political Divisions, and Towns. \u2014 The population consists of two principal elements, the Beloochees, a fine, warlike, and semi-bar barous race, who speak a language allied to Persian ; and the Brahus, a pastoral race occupying Jhalawan, and supposed to be a vestige of the aboriginal population of India. The inhabitants of the maritime plain are stunted and very dark. The commerce of the country is in the hands of Hindoos, and is restricted to the export of dates from the ma ritime region, com from the eastern provinces, and horses from Kelat. The government is divided between local potentates, of whom the Khan of Kelat is chief. The territorial divisions are as follows : \u2014 Cutch Gundava, between the Hala Mountains and the plain of the Indus; Jhalawan, W. of the central part of the Hala Mountains; Sara wan, ou the borders of Afghanistan ; Lus, in the S.E. angle ; Makran, the central and southern district ; and Kohistan, in the W. The chief town is Kelat, S. of the Bolan Pass, which was captured by the British in 1839, and again in 1841, the first capture being occa-"], [427, "Chap. XVIII.

Tope at Bimeran. V. \u2014 Afghanistan. \u00a7 12. Boundaries, &c. \u2014 Towns. \u2014 Afghanistan occupies the N.E. portion of the Iranian plateau, and is bounded E. by the Suliman range, and N. by the Hindoo Koosh : on the W. it adjoins Persia, and on the S. Beloochistan. Its position in reference to India, as the frontier state which must be traversed by a military force ad vancing from Persia or Turkestan, gives it a special interest in the eyes of Anglo-Indians. Its area is estimated at 258,500 sq. m., and its population at 4,000,000. Natural Features, Climate, and Productions. \u2014 The country is through out elevated, and generally rugged with mountains: the town of Cabool stands at an elevation of 6396 ft., Candahar 3484 ft., and Herat 2500 ft. Extensive steppes occur in the W. and S. The Suliman range pre sents an almost unbroken barrier on the side of the Indus between the 29th and 33rd parallels, the only river which pierces it being the Gomul in 32' 5' N. lat. ; the range is named after its culminating point, Takht i-Suliman, \"Solomon's throne\" (11,300 ft.), which is Bituated S. ofthe Gomul Pass. To the N. of the Suliman range an opening is afforded to the valley of the Indus along the course of the river Cabool, which traverses a series of ravines, and is approached from Peshawur by the celebrated Khyber Pass, 30 m. long, and rising to 3373 ft., the scene of terrible loss to the British army in 1842. The Cabool basin is bounded N. by the massive range of Hindoo Koosh, which inclines from N.E. to S.W., and with its southerly continuations closes in the head of the basin. The Bamean Pass, which gives access from the Cabool basin to Turkestan, is situated in the dip between Hindoo Koosh and T 2"], [428, "Book II. 412 AFGHANISTAN. the more westerly range of Koh-i-Baba, and attains an elevation of 8496 ft. The military importance of the Cabool valley, as the great route from India to Afghanistan and Turkestan, can hardly be over estimated. Some of the rivers of Afghanistan seek the Indus, as the Cabool aud the Gomul, the latter of which is, however, absorbed before reaching it3 destination. The drainage of the interior is either gathered into the large lake of Zurrah or Hamoon, which receives the Helmund with the Urghundab from the N.E., and the Kash Rood and other streams from the N. ; or else it is absorbed by the arid soil, as in the cases of the Heri Rood, which flows by Herat from E. to W., and the Murgh, which terminates in Turkestan. The climate is very various : the winters are extremely severe in the high valleys, and the summers temperate : on the other hand, the summer heat of the western plains is excessive. Rain is deficient in the interior. Wherever irrigation is practised, the soil is productive, and the vegetation in parts is semi tropical ; but vast regions are utterly desert, and timber is generally scarce. Fine-fleeced sheep and goats are the most valuable live stock : and camels are the ordinary beasts of burden. Minerals are abundant, and include copper, iron, lead, plumbago, and lignite. Inhabitants, Political Divisions, and Towns. \u2014 The Afghans, or, as they call themselves, Pushtaneb, form the predominating element in the population of Afghanistan. They are a finely-built, warlike, hos pitable, and independent race. They use a language (the Pushtee) which appears to hold an intermediate place between the Indian and Ira nian branches ofthe Indo-European family. The subordinate elements in the population are : \u2014 ( 1 ) The Hazareh and Eimack of the mountainous region in the N.W., both of them Mongol tribes, the first leading a settled, and the second a nomadic life. (2) The Tajiks, or agricul tural labourers, a subject race in a state of serfdom, with a language of their own. And (3) the Turcoman tribe of KuzzQhashes, who act as domestic servants, soldiers, &c. The manufactures of the country consist of carpets, shawls, saddlery, and woollen ; commerce is carried on with the neighbouring countries by caravans. The most powerful states in Afghanistan are Cabool in the N.E., Herat in the N.W. and Candahar in the centre. In addition to these we may notice the terri torial divisions of Seistan about Lake Zurrah, and Sewestan in the S.E. under the Suliman range. The three states first mentioned owe their supremacy to the military importance of their capitals : Cabool is the key of Afghanistan on the side of the upper Indus, Herat on the side of Turkestan and the Caspian, and Candahar on the side of the lower Indus. The two first have sustained numerous sieges, Cabool by the British in 1839 and 1842, and Herat by the Persians in 1838 and 1857, and by the Afghans in 1 863. In the territory of Cabool we may notice Ghuznee, strongly posted on a rock at an elevation of 7726 ft. above the sea, captured by the British in 1839 and 1842, on the latter of which occasions the famous \" Gates of Somnauth \" were carried off from the tomb of Mahmoud ; and Jelalabad, a fortress on the Cabool, held by Sir R. Sale during a long siege by the Afghans in 1841-2. Among the objects of antiquarian interest in this country may be noticed the two colossal statues cut out of the face of a rock near Bamean; the cave dwellings in the same neighbourhood ; and the topes (supposed to be Buddhist sanctuaries; in the Cabool valley."], [429, "Chap.

India \u2014 British India \u2014 Anglo-Indian Empire. \u2014 India, in the popular sense of the term, is generally regarded as co-extensive with Hindostan, either with or without Ceylon. As a geographical region, India includes, in addition, so much of the Indo-Chinese peninsula as skirts the Gulf of Bengal, and which is more precisely termed \" Further India.\" British India, in its proper and restricted sense, applies to so much of the above regions as is under the direct administration of the Indian department of our Government, to the exclusion of the Native States, and also to the exclusion of Ceylon and the Straits Settlements, which are under the Colonial depart ment of our Government. British India is also applied in an ex-"], [430, "414 INDIA. Book II. tended sense to the whole of the Anglo-Indian Empire, inclusive of Ceylon, the Straits Settlements, Aden, and the protected Native States of Hindostan. The following paragraph gives a brief sketch of the growth of this vast empire : \u2014 Historical Geography. \u2014 When the English effected their earliest set tlement in India in 1612, the Mogul dynasty, which had been established at Delhi in 1545, was at the zenith of its power. After tbe death of Aurungzebe in 1707 the empire was torn by the various aspirants to the throne, and the Viceroys availed themselves of the confusion to establish their independence, so that after the capture of Delhi by Nadir Shah in 1739 but a shadow of his former dignity remained to the Great Mogul. The decided advance of British influence dates from the middle of the 18th cent., and originated in the contest with the French for the supremacy, each party aiding and aided by the native powers. The battle of Plassey, in 1757, decided the contest in favour of the British, aud a ten years' war was successfully terminated in 1765 by the recognition of British supremacy in Bengal and Central India. In Southern India the sovereigns of Mysore maintained a long struggle for independence, which was terminated in 1799 by the capture of Seringapatam. The Mahratta war followed in 1803-5, and was signalized by the victory of Assaye and the capture of Delhi and Agra. The Great Mogul thenceforward became a pensioner of the British. The Mahrattas were finally subdued in 1818, and the British dominion has been enlarged by the successive annexations of native principalities. Ceylon was partly taken from the Dutch in 1796, and the remainder was ceded in 1815 by the native chiefs. Aracan and Tenasserim were taken from the Burmese in 1825-6, and Pegu in 1852. Penang and Wellesley were purchased in 1786, and Singapore in 1819, and Malacca was acquired by exchange from the Dutch in 1825. Military Geography. \u2014 The point at which British India is most liable to invasion by an external foe is in the north-west, where the valley of the Cabool affords an approach from Afghanistan, Persia, and Turkestan. This is watched by Peshawur, a strongly fortified place, about 12 m. from the W. entrance of the Khyber Pass, and 40 m. from Attock on the Indus, where that river is crossed by a bridge of boats. The high road through Northern Punjab to the Ganges is lined with military stations. As regards naval warfare the assailable points are few, partly in consequence of the character of the coast. Bombay, which offers the chief inducement to an attack, is heavily defended by the works on the island itself, and by batteries on the detached islands commanding the harbour and its approaches, Oyster Rock, Middle Ground, Butcher's IslaDd, Cross Island, and Colaba Point. Madras is defended seawards by St. George's Fort : the heavy surf and absence of harbour would render the landing of a force at this point a matter of extreme difficulty. Calcutta is quite safe from a naval attack : Fort William perfectly commands the Hooghly below the town. As regards internal warfare, the most noticeable feature is the frequency of hdl fortresses, many of them almost impregnable from their natural strength, and admirably adapted to the conditions of feudal or chief tain warfare. We may instance, among the most remarkable, Dow lutabad, on the Deccan near Aurungabad, with its citadel on an isolated conical rock of granite 500 ft. high ; Chitteldroog, in Mysore, on a hill of no great height, but strongly fortified ; Gwalior, on a precipitous rock with a circumference of 3 m., deemed the \"Gibraltar'' of India;"], [431, "Chap. XIX. NATURAL FEATURES. 415 the fortress of Taraghur near Ajmere, Champanir near Baroda, &c. These hill-forts have played a prominent part in the annals of Anglo- Indian warfare. \u00a7 2. Hindostan \u2014 its Position \u2014 Area and Population. \u2014 Hin dostan is the central one of the three peninsulas of Southern Asia. It is separated from the body of the continent on the N. by the great range of Himalaya, and on the W. by the Suliman range : it pro trudes S. into the Indian Ocean, between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Its boundary in the S.E. is not clearly defined, but it is generally extended to include Chittagong on the Bay of Bengal. It lies between 8\u00b0 5' and 36\u00b0 30' N. lat., 66\u00b0 45' and 96\u00b0 30' E. long. The outline of the peninsula is regular : the western coast contains two considerable inlets, viz. : the Gulf of Cutch and the Gulf of Cambay, between which is the peninsula of Kattiwar. The Runn of Cutch is a vast salt morass with an area of 7400 m., communi cating with the Gulf of Cutch, and submerged during the rainy season. The eastern coast has no feature worthy of notice. The peninsula terminates S. in C. Comorin. Its extreme length and breadth are nearly equal, and measure about 1800 m. ; its area is estimated at 1,463,212 sq. m., and its population at 190,904,783. \u25a0 \u00a7 3. Natural Features. \u2014 Hindostan falls into two great divi sions, continental and peninsular, the limit between which lies at a line drawn from the mouth of the Indus to that of the Ganges. Each of these divisions resembles, more or less, a triangle, the continental a right-angled triangle with the apex in the N.W., and the penin sular an equilateral triangle with the apex pointing S. This division coincides nearly, but not exactly, with the natural and political distinction between Hindostan proper and the Deccan ; the former including Northern and Central India, and the latter Southern India : the N. limit of the Deccan is, however, situated somewhat S. of the line above mentioned. The surface of the country is very varied and presents 5 distinct regions, as follows : \u2014 (1) The vast mountain barrier of Himalaya along the N. frontier, 1500 m. long and from 100 to 150 m. broad. (2) The Plain of the Ganges and Indus, between Himalaya and the two seas which bound the penin sula. (3) The Northern Plateau, which projects in a triangular form into the plain, the apex being situated at Delhi, and the base line at the Sautpoora range and the valley of the Taptee. (4) The plateau of the Deccan, supported E. and W. by the converging ranges of the Ghauts and N. by the Mehadio range on the S. side of the Taptee. (5) The maritime plains below the Ghauts on the E. and W. coasts. Of each of these divisions we append some parti culars. (1) Himalaya.\u2014 The leading feature in the Himalayan range is its colossal proportions : it contains the loftiest summits in the world,"], [432, "Book II, 416 INDIA. but tbe breadth of the range and the massiveness of the ascending terraces have the effect of dwarfing to the eye the culminating points. The range may be divided into two sections at the 80th meridian, the eastern being less rugged and complicated than the western. In the eastern the system resolves it into two parallel ranges, outer and inner, with a wide intermediate region of valleys and highlands. In the western section the terraces and dividiug ranges are more numerous, and the country is broken up by spurs from the main chain. The outer (Sivalik range attains in the eastern section a height of from 8000 to 10,000 ft., and descends to the plain with the abruptness of a wall: in the western section its height varies, occasionally descending to 1000 ft., and even lower. The culminating summits of tbe main range he S. of the line ef greatest elevation. The intermediate region is occu pied generally by valleys running in the direction of the axis of the range, some of them of considerable size and great elevation, as that of Khatmandoo in the eastern section, which is 4500 ft. above the sea, and girt in by mountains of double that height, and Cashmere in the western section, which is 6000 ft. above the sea, and hemmed in by"], [433, "Chap. XIX. NATURAL FEATURES. 417 precipitous ranges of great height. The rivers escape from the moun tains through deep ravines, which occasionally offer scenery of the grandest description : the Jhelum, for instance, rushes into the plain between mountain walls 7000 ft. high, with an interval of only 70 ft. between them at the outer end of the ravine. The amount of level ground throughout the whole of the Himalayan region is remarkably small. In regard to comparative elevation the western section is surpassed by the eastern, especially by that portion which falls within the pro vinces of Nepaul and Sikkim. Bhotan has Chamalhari, in 89\u00b0 15' E. long., as its culminating point, 23,944 ft. The small state of Sikkim includes Kunchinjunga, the second in point of height iu the whole range, 28,156 ft. In Nepaul no less than 12 points exceed 25,000 ft., viz. : Mt. Everest, 86\u00b0 55' E., the crowning height ofthe whole range, 29,002 ft.; Sihsur, 87\u00b0 4' E., 27,799 ft.; Dhawalagiri, 83\u00b0 29' E., 26,826 ft.; the 3 peaks of Yassa, of which the northern, 84\u00b0 33' E., attains to 26,680 ft. ; Jibjibia, 85\u00b0 46' E., 26,305 ft. ; Barathor, 84\u00b0 6' E., 26,069 ft.; Yangma, 87\u00b0 52' E., 26,000 ft. ; and the 3 summits of Narayani, the highest of which in 83\u00b0 22' E., is 25,456 ft. In the western section the culmi nating points in the various provinces are : \u2014 Nanda Devi, in Kumaon, 25,661 ft. ; Ibi-Gamin, in Gurwhal, 25,373 ft. ; Raldang, in Kunawur, 21,250 ft. ; Ratang, in Kooloo, 21,365 ft. ; Shigri, in Lahol, 21,415 ft. ; CMmrat, in Kishtvar, 20,257 ft. ; and Machahoi, in Cashmere, 17,904 ft. The passes across Himalaya are generally very difficult. In the eastern section they are sealed up against the British through the exclusive policy of the Nepaul and Bhotan governments, and the only point at which a passage is open is in Sikkim, where the British have acquired a strip on the side of Bhotan as a result of the recent war with that country. In the western section numerous passes are frequented during the summer months, some of them at extraordinary heights, such as the Niti Pass (16,814 ft.), between Kumaon and Daba in Tibet, and the Ibi-Gamin Pass (20,459 ft.), between Gurwhal and Gnari- Khorsun, which are only available for passengers. W. of these the British Government has commenced the construction of a mule-road to communicate with Tibet, now complete between Simla and Pangee, 121 m. The routes to Turkestan have attracted much attention of late with a view to open a market for our home manufactures and the Himalayan teas : Leh, in Ladakh, is the key of these communications. From the Sutleje side of the Punjab the route crosses the passes of Eotang (13,000 ft.), Bara Lacha (16,221 ft.), and Thuglung (18,042 ft.), in a distance of 396 m. between Kangra and Leh. From the Indus side a route, vid Serinuggur, crosses the passes of Zoj La (11,300 ft.), Kamyika (13,000 ft.), and Photo La (13,240 ft.), in a distance of 302 m. between Murree and Leh. From Leh the route crosses the difficult Mustakh Pass. The snow-line on the S. side of Himalaya lies at 16,200 ft. ; the glaciers are on a vast scale, and descend in one instance (Tchaja) as low as to 10,520 ft. Trees and wheat flourish up to 14,800 ft. In spite of the magnificence of Himalaya its scenery is not much admired, the views being too distant and the general aspect monotonous. (2) Tlie Indo-Gangetic Plain. \u2014 The plain of the Indus and Ganges is remarkable for its extreme uniformity of level, which nowhere exceeds an elevation of 1200 ft. No line of heights marks the watershed between the basins of these large rivers. The plain attains its greatest width on the side of the Indus, between the Suliman mountains in the W. and the Aravulh range in the E. Along the Ganges it is narrowed by the T 3"], [434, "INDIA, Book II, 418 advance of the plateau to the neighbourhood of its rt. bank between Delhi and Rajmahal, and on this river it attains its greatest width along the sea-coast, where it may be said to extend from Cuttack in the S.W. to Chittagong in the S.E. In the N.E. the plain is continued along the course of the Brahmapootra between the Himalayas on the N. and the Garrow and Cossya hills on the S., and again along the course of the Soormah between the hills just mentioned and the high ground of Tipperah. Its total area is estimated at 500,000 sq. m. The plain is fringed on the N. by a swampy and malarious belt of forest named the Terai, whicb owes its existence to the drainage of the adjacent mountains, and has a general width of from 25 to 30 m. The remainder of the Gangetic plain has a fertile soil, and presents in this respect a great contrast to the plain of the Indus. The Indus rises in Tibet to the N. of the crest-range of Himalaya, and pursues a N.W. course until it approaches the Hindoo Koosh in 74\u00b0 30' E. long., where it turns sharply round to the S.W., and thence holds a course parallel to the Suliman and Hala ranges : it forms a considerable delta, which may be said to commence above Hydrabad, and it reaches the sea by 7 chief channels. The river is navigable throughout to Attock, where it emerges from the mountains, but shifting sandbanks render navigation difficult. The chief port of the Indus is Kurrachee, which lies W. of the present delta, and has been improved by dredging, so far as to make it accessible to ships of burden. The tributaries of the Indus are rt. the Cabool and 1. the Punjnud, which brings to it the united waters of the rivers of the Punjab, viz. : the Jhelum, the Chenab, the Ravee, the Sutleje, and ita tributary the Beas. The district between the Indus and the Aravulli Mts. is for the most part desert ; portions of the Punjab bear the same character, but the \"Doabs\" (as the spaces between converging rivers are called^ admit of irrigation and are very fertile. The Ganges rises on the southern slope of Himalaya, enters the plain at Hurdwar, bends round S. and S.E., and holds a course gene- rally parallel to Himalaya to near the head of its delta, when it turns S. to the sea. Its fall in the plain is gentle, its elevation above the sea being 1024 ft. at Hurdwar, 400 at Allahabad, and 80 at the head of its delta. The scenery is generally uninteresting, but where the ranges of the plateau press close to its rt. bank at Rajmahal and Mirzapore, its banks are picturesque. The delta is an intricate maze of channels with jungle-covered pestdential islands, comprised under the general name of the Sunderbunds: the navigable channels are 14 in number, but the commerce of the country is almost wholly confined to the Hooghly, on which Calcutta stands. The affluents of the Ganges are most numerous on its 1. or Himalayan bank : we may notice the Goomtee, which winds about with a deeply cut channel, the Gogra or chief river of Oude, nearly a mile wide at its confluence, and the Gunduok from Nepaul: on its rt. bank it receives the Jumna from the lower Himalaya, with the Chumbul from the plateau of Malwa ; and the Sone, a very broad river, rising in the same quarter, but taking a more easterly course. The Brahmapootra, which interlaces with the Ganges at its delta, rises near the Indus in Tibet, and doubles round the eastern flank of Himalaya, after which it flows S.W. through the broad valley of Assam, and carries down a body of water about equal to that of the Ganges itself: it receives 1. the Barak, which drains the plain S. of the Garrow and Cossya hills, ramifying through the flat district called the Jheels with an infinity of channels. Calcutta, the chief port of the Gauges,"], [435, "419 Chap. XIX. NATURAL FEATURES. stands on the Hooghly, 100 m. from the sea; the constant silting of the channel is a serious objection to it. A new harbour is being formed at Canning Town, 30 m. to the S.E., on the Mutlah branch. (3j The Northern Plateau. \u2014 The northern plateau is bounded on the W. by the Aravnlli Mts., and on the S. by the Sautpoora ' range, which separates the basins of the Nerbudda and the Taptee. Towards the N. and E. it declines towards the Jumna, and subsides into the plain near Delhi. The northern plateau contains the following divisions and ranges : \u2014 (1) The Plateau of Malwa in the N., gradually rising from N. to S. until it attains a height of about 2000 ft. near the Vindhya range ; the title is sometimes limited to the section immediately N. of that range as far as the Harraouttee Hills, a distance of about 80 m. ; (2) the Vindhya range, which separates the Plateau of Malwa from the valley of the Nerbudda, and which does little more than overtop the level of the plateau ; its line is prolonged E. in the fertile Kymore Hills to the bank of the Ganges at Mirzapore ; (3) the Sautpoora range, S. of the Nerbudda, and prolonged E. iu a ridge of considerable elevation (the Goomah Ghauts), which terminates in the Rajmahal Hills on the bank of the Ganges, with the culminating height of Parasnath (4500 ft.) ; lastly (4), the Plateau of Omerkuntuk, with an average ele vation of 7000 ft., the high ground on which the Nerbudda, the Sone, and several branches of the Mahanuddy take their rise. S. of this plateau is a lower region, of which little is known, extending from the frontier of Bengal to the Godavery : it is a broken, jungly, pestilential district, belonging rather to the plateau than to the maritime plain. The rivers of the northern plateau chiefly seek the Ganges, as is the case with the Chumbul on the Plateau of Malwa, and the Sone. which drains the valley between the Kymore Hills and the Goomah Ghauts ; the Nerbudda and the Taptee, however, seek the Gulf of Cambay, flow ing in nearly parallel courses : the Nerbudda, which is the most im portant of the two, is navigable in its mid-course and also for about 90 m. of its lower course ; but these sections are divided by an un navigable interval of rocky and rapid water. The scenery of the Nerbudda in this interval is grand, and many parts of this region have broken ground and rugged heights, which offer good sites for fortresses. On the opposite side of the peninsula the Mahanuddy receives a large portion of its supply through the Sheonath and the Husdoo from the plateau of Omerkuntuk. (4) The Plateau of the Deccan. \u2014 The Plateau of the Deccan or \"south\" country is bounded E. and W. by the converging lines of the Ghauts, and N. by a similar but less clearly defined line of heights which follows the Taptee in the W. and the Godavery in the E., and of which the Mahadeo Hills, between the Taptee and the Poorna, are a link. The plateau rises towards the S. and attains an average elevation of 2500 ft. in Mysore : it slopes towards the E., as shown by the rivers, which rise on the Western Ghauts and seek the Bay of Bengal. The Ghauts are so called from the \" ghats \" or \" passes \" which occur at intervals iu tbe west line. The Western Ghauts skirt the coast at an average distance of 30 m., and rise to a varying height of from 3000 1 The valley ofthe Nerbudda is generally rather the Taptee valley with its strongly regarded as the limit between the northern marked boundaries, the Sautpoora Alts. and southern plateaus ; but this valley and the Mahadio Hills. See Journal of appears to be merely a depression in the Geog. Soc, vol. xi., pp. 58, 59. northern plateau, and the true boundary is"], [436, "Book II, 420 INDIA, to 6000 ft. : from tbe maritime plain they present the appearance of a lofty mountain-wall, generally clothed with luxuriant forests, but in places so precipitous as to give no footing for vegetation : from the plateau they assume the form of ridges running at right angles to the line of elevation and overtopping the plateau by from 500 to 1000 ft. The Eastern Ghauts are less lofty (not exceeding 3500 ft.), less con tinuous, and more remote from the coast-line. The two ranges meet in the Neilgherry Hills, which rise in Dodabeta to 8760 ft., and have a considerable amouut of surface between 5000 and 7000 ft. high. S. of the Neilgherries a remarkable break occurs in the Western Ghauts, known as the Gap of Coimbatore, beyond which the line is resumed in the mountains of Travancore. The Deccan is generally level ; but some of the ridges above noticed run far back over the plateau, and in other parts isolated flat-topped hills are not uncommon. The rivers of the Deccan are the Godavery, the Kistnah, the Pennair, and the Cauvery : each of these drains a considerable area by means of numerous branches, which converge on the Deccan and discharge their united waters through the few openings afforded by the Eastern Ghauts. The Ghauts and the ranges of Southern India abound with interesting scenery, in which precipices, forests, and waterfalls, are conspicuous features. Khandala, at the head of the Bhore Ghaut, and the Mahabuleshwar hills, in 17\u00b0 59' N. lat., are favourite spots for the scenery of the western Ghauts ; and there are fine falls in this range \u2014 on the Markund at Gogak, 35 m. N.E. of Belgaum, and on the Sheravutty at Gerseppa, in 14\u00b0 15' N. lat., where there is a series of four falls, the highest having a clear descent of 890 ft. In the Eastern Ghauts the falls of the Cauvery at Shiva Samudram are famous, where the river is divided by an islaud, and makes a leap of 460 ft. on the N. branch and of 370 ft. on the S. branch. The scenery of the Neilgherries, and of the Animalle hills, about 60 m. more S., is very striking, and in the Travancore mountains there are fine falls on the Chittar at Kutallam and on the Tamraparni at Papanasham. (5) The Maritime Plains and Coast-line of the Deccan. \u2014 The plain that underlies the Western Ghauts is much broken by lateral spurs emanating from the Ghauts. In some parts indeed these spurs descend close to the sea-shore and occupy the bulk of the surface : this is the case between the 14th and 15th parallels. Elsewhere a sandy belt gene- rally fringes the coast. The soil immediately under the Ghauts is very fertile. The coast-line is regular, aud harbourage scanty: Bombay has a safe and roomy harbour formed by islands, and on the Malabar Coast, as the southern section is named, there are good harbours at Goa and Cochin, the latter protected by a natural breakwater of soft mud, and having communication with the adjacent country by a backwater ex- tending on each side of it, and affording safe navigation. The other harbours on the western coast are encumbered with bars, and rarely admit of vessels drawing more than 10 ft. Tellicherry receives vessels of 500 or 600 tons, and there are harbours at Mangalore, Cananore, and Calicut. Beypore, the terminus of the Madras railway on the Malabar coast, has only an open roadstead. The Eastern Plain attains its greatest expansion opposite the Gap of Coimbatore : thence it contracts to about 30 m. near Madras, and again expands. The rivers form large deltas which facilitate irrigation and render it one of the most productive parts of India. Harbourage is again deficient, and a tremendous surf breaks on the coast : at Madras vessels have to anchor in the roads. which are unsafe in a N.E. wind : the same may be said of Pondicherry"], [437, "421 Chap. XIX. CLIMATE AND PRODUCTIONS. and other places on this coast, with the exception of Masulipatam, which is free from surf and admits vessels of 300 tons. \u00a7 4. Climate. \u2014 The varying altitude of India affords a corre sponding variety of climate. While the summer heat of the plains is extreme, reaching in Lower Scinde to a mean of 98\u00b0 5', and in Upper Scinde even to 130\u00b0 in the shade, the temperature of the hills at an elevation of about 7000 ft., as at Ootakamund in the Neilgherries and at Simla and Darjeeling on the sub-Himalayan ranges, resembles that of fine summer weather in England, and higher up the Himalayas it is easy to reach the limit of perpetual snow. The mean annual temperature at Ootakamund is 58\u00b0, on the Deccan plateau generally about 75\u00b0, at Calcutta 79\u00b0, at Bombay 80\u00b0, and at Madras 84\u00b0. The rain-fall varies still more : the hill sides which are exposed to the south-west monsoon come in for an exces sive amount, reaching at Mahabuleshwar, 70 m. S. of Bombay, to about 260 inches, and at Cherrapongee, on the S. side of the Cossya hills, to 650 inches. Himalaya also has a heavy rain-fall, amount ing at Darjeeling to 120 inches. Districts shut off from the S.W. monsoon or remote from the sea, have a varying amount, descending almost to nil in the desert W. of the Aravulli Mts., diminishing gradually as you ascend the Ganges from 65 inches at Calcutta to 40 at Benares and 20 at Delhi, and being very moderate on the Deccan plateau, where the rain-clouds are intercepted by the Western Ghauts. The cooling influence of the S.W. monsoon is however felt gratefully on the Deccan, even where the rain-fall is not large. The N.E. monsoon is most felt at Madras, but it is far less beneficial in its effects than the S.W. monsoon. The rainy season at Bombay is between June and October, and at Madras between October and March. The plains, and especially those parts of them which have a luxuriant vegetation, are trying to European constitutions : the Terai, the Sunderbunds, and all swampy places are pre-eminently unhealthy. The sanatoria are on the high grounds at elevations varying from 2000 ft. to 7500 ft. : the most frequented are Simla and Darjeeling on the Himalayas ; Aboo, on the Aravulli range ; Ootakamund, Kotageri, and Coonoor on the Meilgherries; and Cherrapongee, on the Cossya hills, which is con veniently situated for Calcutta. Bangalore and other spots on the highest parts of the Deccan are healthy. Natural Productions. \u2014 The natural resources of India are of the most varied character. Coal is found in the Sivalik or sub-Himalayan ranges, in the upper basins of the Godavery and Nerbudda, and in the Burdwan district, where the mines at Raneegunge are extensively worked. Iron of the best quality is found in various parts of the Deccan, in the valley of the Wein-gunga, a tributary ofthe Godavery, about Jubbulpore, near the head of the Nerbudda, in the Kymore and Rajmahal hills, and"], [438, "Book II. 422 INDIA, other parts. Several of the rivers are auriferous : diamonds are found in the sandstone detritus near Ellore, and near Punnah in Bundel cund : the minas on the Pennair near Cuddapah and Gooty, which once supplied the merchants of Golconda, are no longer worked. Copper is abundant in Nepaul, and is found in the Eastern Ghauts. The Salt ranfe in the Punjab and the lakes in Rajpootana yield supplies of salt. Saltpetre is largely produced in the south of the Punjab, in Oude, Berar, and elsewhere. The flora embraces a wide range of species from the arctic plants of the upper Himalayas to the tropical luxuriance of the plains. English forest- and fruit-trees flourish on the sub-Hima layan and Neilgherry hills. But the characteristic products of the country are the wide-spreading banyan-tree, the teak, valuable for ship building and abundant on the Western Ghauts, the saul of Terai, the banana, the various species of the palm-tribe (such as the palmyra or toddy palm, the sugar date-palm, the cocoa-nut palm), the mango, which ranks especially as \" the fruit of India,\" the plantain, the india rubber tree, &c. The uses to which the component parts of trees, especially palms, are applied, are very various : sugar, wine, spirit, oil, wax, mats, ropes, and thread, are among the articles produced from them. The finest wheat is produced in Oude : maize attains a gigantic height, and rice thrives wherever irrigation is possible. Various kinds of pulse are grown, among them the ervum lens, from which the sub stance called in this country revalenta Arabica is manufactured. Opium and indigo rank among the most valuable commercial products : hemp, jute, sugar, and flax, also hold an important place. Large tracts of land are adapted to the growth of cotton ; but the staple is not considered equal to that of America. We may lastly notice the various species of the ginger-tribe (ginger, cardamoms, and turmeric), dye-plants (madder, safflower, and the saffron of Cashmere), medicinal plants (the castor oil-plant, and the cinchona or quinine-plant, which has been introduced from America, and thrives on the Neilgherries),1 tanning substances (cutch, from the acacia catechu), tea., an increasing production in Assam, on the sub-Himalayan hills (at Darjeeling in Sikkim, in the valley of Dehra Doon in Kumaon, at Kangra and Murree in the Punjab), and again at Hazareebaugh in Chota Nagpore, and in various parts of Silhet and Cachar ; and coffee of good quality on the Neil gherries. The most noteworthy animals are the yak, which serves as a beast of burden across the high passes of the Himalayas ; the zebu or Indian ox, the Cashmere goat, which yields the fine shawl-wool, and the elephant, which even in a wild state has a commercial value from its teeth. The silk-worm is cultivated in Assam and Bengal, and the lac-insect yields sticklac, from which a valuable scarlet-dye and resin are produced. \u00a7 5. Inhabitants, Government, Manufactures, Commerce, Communications. \u2014 The Hindoos form the built of the population of India. They belong to the Indo-Germanic division of the human race, and appear to have entered the peninsula from the north-west, and to have settled on the plains of the Ganges about the 13th century B.C. Their language is based on the old Sanscrit, and falls 1 Since its first introduction in this lo- I the S-, to Darjeeling in the N., and to the cality, the culture has extended to the Mahabuleshwar hills in the Western Pulney, Coorg, and Travancore bills in | Ghauts."], [439, "Chap. XIX. 423 INHABITANTS. Temple at Tanjore. into numerous dialects, which may be grouped under the heads of Hindi, Bengali, Mahratti, Gujerati, and Orissa. They profess Brah minism, which appears to have superseded its offshoot Buddhism in the 6th century of our era. They are divided into numerous castes, which abstain rigidly from all intermarriage, aud, as far as possible, even from contact with each other. Their religious pre judices are very strong : the barbarous practice of suttee or widow burning has been repressed by law. The Hindoos are intelligent and frugal ; ceremonious to equals and servile to superiors ; subtle, vindictive, and treacherous. The aboriginal tribes whom the Hindoos displaced were a black race, using languages of the Turanian class. Their descendants still hold their ground in the remote parts of the country, and retain their original tongues, generically termed Dravidian, and comprising Tamil, Telugu, Tulu, Malayalam, and Canara. This class includes the Gonds of Omerkuntuk and the"], [440, "Book II. 424 INDIA. N.W. of Orissa ; the Bheels between the Vindhya and the Aravulli chains ; the Coulies of the Western Ghauts about Bombay ; the Ramusis and Warlis of the southern part of the Western Ghauts ; the Katodars of the Neilgherries ; the Shanars of Tinnevelly ; and the Chenewars of the Eastern Ghauts. The Bhotyas of Bhotan are Mongols, and profess Buddhism. Afghans or Patans are very nu merous and are rigid Mohammedans. We may further notice the Arabs and Black Jews of the Malabar coast ; the Parsees or Persian fire-worshippers of Bombay and the neighbourhood, for the most part a wealthy and enterprising class ; and the Cathies of Gujerat, who are sun-worshippers and freebooters, governed by priests and bards. A primitive branch of the Christian Church has existed on the Malabar coast since the 3rd century, and still numbers 120,000 adherents. European settlers form a very slight element, numerically speaking, in the teeming population of India. In 1861 the British numbered about 126,000, two-thirds of whom belonged to the army. The Portuguese are numerous on the Malabar coast, and to these we may add a few French and Dutch. Christian missions have been established in most parts of India, and have met with large success in the southern districts. Government. \u2014 British India was transferred in 1858 from the East India Company to the Crown, and its affairs are now administered by the following authorities : \u2014 (1) In England, a Secretary of State, who is a member of the Cabinet ; and a Council of State, presided over by the Secretary, and numbering 15 members, of whom 8 are nominated by the Crown, and the other 7 are elected by the Court of Directors. (2) In India, a Viceroy, in whom the executive power is vested ; a Supreme Council, which Bits at Calcutta, and consists of 6 members, including the Viceroy or Govern or- General ; an Imperial Legislative Council, consisting of the Supreme Council and additional members ; and separate Councils for each of the Presidencies, Bengal, Madras, and Bombay. The native governments are autocracies, the title of the sovereign being Rajah. Education. \u2014 A system of general education for the natives was set on foot by the British Government in 1854, consisting of primary schools for the poor, and universities with affiliated colleges for the higher classes. The universities are located at the 3 presidency towns, and there are colleges at Calcutta, Dacca, Hooghly, Kishnaghur, Berhampore, and Patna in Bengal; Agra, Bareilly, and Benares, in the North- Western Provinces ; and Delhi and Lahore, in the Punjab. Government aid is now extended to 17,117 schools, having an average attendance of 436,000 pupils. No religious instruction is given in these schools. Numerous schools and colleges have been founded by the Missionary Societies, and by private munificence. Agricidlure. \u2014 The progress of agriculture in India is in various ways affected by the peculiar tenures on which the land is held. The State in this, as in other Oriental countries, is owner or part-owner of the soil, and shares the profits of its cultivation with the agriculturist. Sometimes it receives its share directly from the cultivator (ryot). sometimes through a middle-man (zemindar), who sublets to the ryoti"], [441, "AGRICULTURE \u2014 MANUFACTURES. 425 Chap. XIX. and sometimes again through a combination of the inhabitants of a village, who make their own arrangements for the division of the sum to be paid. These may be distinguished as the ryotwar, zemindary, and village-tenure systems. The zemindary system prevails in Northern India, and the others in the two southern Presidencies. To these wTe may add the system of inams, or rent-free grants for one or more lives, which is not unusual in the Madras Presidency. A difference also exists as to the period for which the assessment of the State's share is made. In the Bengal Presidency the sum is fixed in perpetuity ; in the North-West Provinces and the Punjab, for a term of 30 years. In Bombay the assessment has hitherto been made annually, but both here and in Madras the Government is substituting the longer period, in order that the cultivator may have a stronger interest in improving the soil. The success of agriculture is dependent on the amount of irrigation, natural or artificial, supplied to the soil. A dry or com paratively dry season is fatal to the very existence of the crops, and there are large areas in India which only need moisture to transform them from wildernesses into gardens. Hence the great importance of the irrigation works which have been set on foot, and some of which are noticed below. As to the crops cultivated in the various districts we may notice as the chief \u2014 wheat, especially in Oude, the North-West Provinces, the Punjab, and the Central Provinces ; millet and maize, in localities where there is not sufficient moisture for wheat, as in Scinde ; cotton, the best quality in Assam and Chittagong, also largely grown in Oude, Bahar, the Central Provinces and on the Deccan ; opium in Bahar, Oude, and in the native states of Malwa and Gujerat ; indigo, especially in the N. of Bengal ; sugar, in Oude and Bahar ; rice, the staple product of British Burmah, also in the Central Provinces and other parts; flax, in the North-Western Provinces and the Punjab ; and hemp, in the latter district. Manufactures. \u2014 The leading branch of manufacture in India consists of the various textile fabrics of which the native dress is composed . Some of these are of the finest quality aud beautifully embroidered \u2014 the muslins of Nandair, Muktul, and other places in the Nizam's territory, and of Arnee near Madras ; the embroideries of Delhi and the Punjab, floss silk and braid on silk and cloth ; the gold and silver thread em broideries of Benares ; the slippers and caps of Lucknow \u2014 all of which are appreciated in Europe. The silk of India is remarkably soft and fine. We may further notice the chintzes of Masulipatam, the highly prized Cashmere shawls, and the carpets of Warungul in the Deccan. The jewelry of the large towns on the Ganges, particularly Benares, Delhi, Patna, and Calcutta, is much admired ; as are also the carvings in wood and ivory, applied to furniture, toys, and ornaments. The manufacture of opium is an important branch of industry at Patna and Benares. Commerce. \u2014The commerce of Iudia is chiefly with Great Britain, whither it exports the bulk of its raw produce, cotton, indigo, rice, oil-seeds, sugar, silk, jute, and wool : receiving in return cottons, cottou-yarn, woollens, iron, machinery, copper, and sundries. The exports far exceed in value the imports, and the balance has to be paid for in cash. To China is sent the opium, which is so important a pro duct of India. Communications. \u2014 A very complete system of trunk lines of railway is in progress, and will shortly be brought to a completion. The chief lines are: \u2014 (1) The East Indian, which traverses the basin of the Ganges from Calcutta to Delhi, and has a branch to Jubbulpore on"], [442, "INDIA, Book II. 426 the upper Nerbudda. (2) The Great Indian Peninsular, which starts from Bombay and makes for Jubbulpore in one direction, where it connects with the Calcutta line, and for Raichore in another direction where it will meet the Madras line : the three capitals will thus be united by this line. (3) The Madras line, in one direction to Beypore on the Malabar coast, in auother by Cuddapah to Raichore. (4) The Scinde, Punjab, aud Delhi lines, the last of which is designed to connect the basins of the Indus and the Ganges between Umritsir and Delhi : the Scinde line connects the port of Kurrachee with Kotree at the head of the Indus Delta, and the Punjab takes up the section between Mooltan and Umritsir. The traffic between Kotree and Mooltan is carried on by the Indus Flotilla, but it seems likely that this will ere long be superseded by a railway. In addition to these trunk lines there are others of local importance, such as the Bombay and Baroda to Ahmedabad in Gujerat, the Eastern Bengal, &c. The Canals in India are on a grand scale, but are more designed for irrigation than for traffic. Irrigation Works. \u2014 The most favourable spots for these operations are the deltas on the coast districts, and the doabs in the interior. Thus in the delta of the Godavery, 780,000 acres are irrigated by canals extending 840 m., exclusive of branches : in the delta ofthe Kistnah, 600,000 acres by 290 m. of canal; and in the delta of the Cauvery, 700,000 acres. In each of these cases anicuts, or embankments, are thrown across the rivers at the head of the deltas, by means of which the area to be irrigated is enlarged, and the water-supply is controlled and raised to a higher level : some of these anicuts are very massive, that of the Godavery being 3955 yards long. Works are in progress for fertilizing the desert plains of Scinde by means of the old channels, such as the Narra, which run parallel to the Indus. In the doabs we may notice the Ganges Canal, 525 m. in length, which draws its supply from the river below the Sivalik hills, and distributes it between the Gauges and Jumna, terminating at Humeerpore on the former river and at Cawnpore on the latter : the Jumna canals, Eastern and Western, fertilizing the plains N. of Delhi ; and the extensive systems in the Punjab. Many of these canals are also available for navigation, as the Ganges Canal, tbe Northern Godavery Canal which leads to the port of Cocanada, and the northern canals of the Kistnah delta, leading to Masulipatam and vid Ellore to the Godavery. \u00a7 6. Political Divisions. \u2014 The political divisions of India may be classed under the three heads of (1) British Possessions, (2) Native States, and (3) French and Portuguese Possessions.

Book II. Subdivisions and Towns. \u2014 The Governments above enumerated are subdivided into districts under Collector-Magistrates, or Deputy- Commissioners. In all the Governments except Madras, the Hyder abad assigned districts, and Coorg, the two latter of which are of small area, the districts are grouped together into Divisions under Com missioners. A list of these Divisions, with their respective towns, is given in the subjoined table. Tho \"Ranges\" introduced under that head in Madras, are a geographical and not a political arrangement. The titles of the Districts are generally drawn from their respective seats of government ; but in many cases district-names are retained, such as the Sunderbunds and 24 Pergunnahs,* in the Nuddea Division ; Dehra Doon, a valley in the Meerut Division ; Bunnoo, a desert tract ia Derajat, W. of the Indus ; Thur and Parknr, desert tracts in Scinde ; Candeish, in Bombay ; and Canara, divided between Bombay and Madras. A distinction is made between Regulation and Non-Regulation Provinces, tbe latter being exempted from the Government rules as to matters of law and finance. Many of the old territorial titles remain in current use, such as Sirhind, between the Jumna and Sutleje ; Boail cnnd, now included in the province of Bareilly ; Berar, in Central India, about the upper valleys of the Wurdah, and Waingunga, &c, now answering to the Hyderabad Assigned Districts ; Daman, the \"border\" country between the Indus and Suliman; the Concans, North and South, on the Bombay coast: the Carnatic on the Coro mandel coast from C.

Some of the border States are wholly in dependent, and maintain an exclusive policy, avoiding all intercourse with the British, as is particularly the case with Bhotan and Nepaul. Of the rest some are merely on terms of nominal alliance, as is the case with Sikkim ; but the majority are more or less under the control of Great Britain, in one of the three following conditions, as : \u2014 (1) Sub sidiary, in which a native army is sustained, but under British control ; (2; Tributary, in which protection is afforded by the British, at the cost of the native state ; (3 ) Protected, in which the British undertake protection without the payment of tribute. The term \" protected \" is not unfrequently extended to all the three classes. The above dis tinctions imply the possession and to a certain extent the administration of the states by their respective chiefs. Such chiefs are recognised as Feudatories of the British Crown by a Sunnud or patent issued in 1862, which secured to them the possession of their estates, together with the privilege of adopting a successor. The number of these Feudatory chiefs is 144. Distinct from these are the chiefs who retain their estate but have no administrative powers ; the Talookdars of Oude fall under this class. A third class yet exists, consisting of chiefs who are simply pensioners.

Rajpootana occupies a very large area on each side of the Aravulli range, extending W. to the plain of the Indus. This is divided between 18 states, 15 of which are Rajpoot, two are Jat (Bhurtpore and Dholpore), and the remaining one (Tonk) is Mohammedan.

In Madras, Travancore occupies the S. section of the Malabar coast ; Cochin lies N. of Travancore (exclusive of the town, which belongs to the British) ; and Poodoocottah, S. of Tanjore. In addition to the above, there are a variety of lesser states or chief- tainships. In Central India these are for the most part mediatized, and are thrown into groups under the several Agencies of Indore, Bhopal, Nimar, Dhar, and Bhopawur. We may, however, except from this description Dhar itself, together with Dewa: and Jowrah, on the Malwa plateau. The mediatized chiefs have in some instances territories of appreciable size, as Rutlam and Sillana. On the Assam frontier there are the Cossya States, Jyntia, and others.

Towns, Noteworthy Objects, Historical Associations. \u2014 The towns of India resemble the generality of Oriental towns in having a picturesque aspect from the outside, and a forbidding interior of narrow, tortuous, and ill-built streets. Gardens and tanks occupy a large proportion of their area, contributing largely to the health and comfort of the inhabitants. Most towns possess indi vidual buildings of interest, either pagodas, mosques, forts, or palaces ; and the \" ghats \" or landing-places of the Ganges towns are a noticeable feature. Those in which Europeans congregate have a quarter built after the European fashion. A classification of the towns dispersed over so large a country, and with few distinctive features, is a matter of difficulty. Calcutta holds the first place as the double capital both of British India and of the Bengal Presi dency : with the addition of its suburbs, it is by far the most popu lous place in India, and its rapid rise shows the value of its position as a commercial capital, at the outlet of the Ganges valley, and midway between Hither and Further India. Whether it is equally suitable in these days as the seat of the Supreme Government is questionable: its want of centrality, its remoteness from Europe, and its extreme heat, are objections to it in this respect. Bombay, the second of the Presidency towns in population, has the advantage over Calcutta in proximity to Europe ; the formation of railways has partly supplied its natural deficiency of inland communications : it also possesses a good natural harbour, and from these combined circumstances is rapidly rising to the first place as a commercial and financial centre. Madras, the remaining Presidency town, labours under every disadvantage of position and natural capability, having neither proximity to Europe nor centrality in reference to India, and being alike devoid of a harbour for external, and of a river for internal communication : nevertheless, it is a large and flourishing town, and the chief commercial emporium of Southern India. The \"holy cities\" form a most important class, inasmuch as they become the centres of permanent or temporary commerce : in this respect Benares holds the first place, being pre-eminently the holy city of the Hindoos, frequented by pilgrims from all parts of India, and having a large and active population engaged in manufactures (jewelry, textile fabrics, opium, &c), financial operations, and general commerce. Allahabad is also largely visited by pilgrims, on the score of its position at the sacred confluence of the Jumna and Ganges : it is now the capital of the North-West Provinces. We may also notice among the Bacred places, Hurdwar, \" the gate of the Ganges,\" at the point where MOD. GEO. D"], [450, "Book II, 434 INDIA the river issues from the Himalayas, a place where large fairs are neld at the pilgrimage season, particularly at the Koom Mala which recurs at intervals of twelve years ; Oude, a much venerated but now dilapi dated place ; Muttra, on the Jumna ; Amritsir, the fane of the Sikhs and the most important commercial town in the Punjab, deriving its name (meaning the \"pool of immortality') from a holy reservoir on an island with a temple ; Pooree or Juggernauth, on the E. coast, S. of Cuttack, with a temple of great size ; Gayah, in Bahar, S. of Patna ; Oojein, in Scindia's Territory, an active trading centre on the Malwah plateau ; and Nassick, 95 m. N.E. of Bombay, the most venerated fane of the Deccan. Among the other cities of the first rank may be men tioned Delhi, on the Jumna, the old Mohammedan capital and his torically the most interesting place in India, still of importance as a commercial, manufacturing, and military place ; Lucknow, the capital of Oude, on the Goorntee ; Mirzapore, on the Ganges, above Benares, a manufacturing and commercial ( cotton ) town ; Patna, on the Ganges, with an opium factory and a large traffic ; Moorshedabad, on the Ganges, N. of Calcutta, once the capital of Bengal; Dacca, formerly famed for its muslins ; Bareilly, the chief town of Rohilcund ; Lahore, the capital of the Punjab, near the Ravee ; Mooltan, the most important military and commercial town in the southern Punjab ; Hyderabad, the capital of Scinde, near the head of the Indus Delta ; Baroda, the capital of Guicowar's Territory, near the Gulf of Cambay ; Ahmedabad, N. of the Gulf of Cambay, once the most splendid city in India, and still a large place ; Surat, on the Taptee, a dep&t for the export of cotton and other products of the Taptee basin ; Nagpore, the chief town in the Central Provinces ; and Hyderabad, the capital of the Nizam's Territory, a large and wealthy city, on an affluent of the Kistnah. The military stations have a special interest attaching to them in consequence of the large proportion of English necessarily resident in them. Their healthiness or unhealthiness is very much dependent on their elevation, and hence in each of the Presidencies sanatory stations are established on the high ground, to which the troops may be shifted from the plains. In the two southern Presidencies this is comparatively easy, from the proximity of the Ghauts to the maritime plains ; in Bombay we may notice the following stations with their respective altitudes above the sea : \u2014 Poonah (1823 ft.), a large place, readily acces sible from Bombay; Kirkee, 5 m. from Poonah; Aimednuggur ( 1 900 ft.), 58 m. E. of Poonah ; Belgaum (2500 ft.), in the southern division of the Presidency ; Aboo (5u00 ft.), on an outlying summit of the Aravulli range; Nusseerabad (1486 ft.), under the Aravulli hills; Mhow (2019 ft.), on the Malwa plateau ; and Neemuch (1476 ft.), in Scindia's Territory ; the three latter situated inland, and consequently very hot in spite of their elevation. In the Madras Presidency \u2014 Wellington, on the Neilgherries ; Bangalore (3000 ft.), in Mysore, very healthy ; Bellary (1200 ft.), in the centre of the Deccan, with a re markably dry air ; Secunderabad (1830 ft.), 6 m. from Hyderabad ; and Kamptee, in the Central Provinces, 10 m. N. of Nagpore. In the Bengal Presidency the large expanse of plain and the remoteness of the hills from the centres of population, present difficulties to the interchange of high and low stations, and here the high stations are for the most part purely of a sanatory character; such are those on the Sivalik Hills at Darjeeling (7400 ft.) in Sikkim, Ninee Tal in Kumaon. Landour, Mussourie (6282 ft.), and Bndraj in Gurwhal, Subathoo (1100 ft. above the Gangetic plain) S.W. of Simla ; Dugshaie and Kussowlis"], [451, "CHAr. XIX.

British Possessions in Further India. \u2014 To the E. of Hin dostan the Malay Peninsula, emanating from what is commonly des cribed as the Indo-Chinese Peninsula, projects like a long tongue far to the S., and constitutes a well-defined boundary between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Off its southern extremity is the small island of Singapore, commanding the strait which forms the great highway between China and the West. Here on the very verge of the two oceans is the eastern limit of our Indian Empire. From Singapore northwards the sea-board of the Bay of Bengal is almost wholly in the hands of Great Britain. On the AV. coast of the Malay Penin sula she possesses the settlements of Malacca, between the small independent states of Johore and Salangore ; and Province Wellesley, a dependency of Prince of Wales Island or Penang, lying between the native states of Perah inthe S. and Queddah, tributary to Siam, in the N. Above this the coast belongs to Siam as far as 10\u00b0 N. lat., where the Tenasserim provinces begin, and carry the British territory to the head of the Gulf of Martaban. Pegu succeeds in the delta of the Irawaddy : then Aracan from Cape Negrais to Chit tagong in 21\u00b0 4C N. lat., at which point we enter Hindostan. The possessions above enumerated are under the Indian Government,"], [453, "Chap. XIX. BRITISH BURMAH. 437 with the exception of the settlements on the Malay peninsula, which were formed into an independent government under the title of the Eastern Straits Settlements in 1867. The remaining pro vinces are comprised under the head of British Burmah. Aracan \u2014 Aracan extends for about 230 m. along the coast of the Bay of Bengal, and has an average depth inland of 50 m. The islands of Ramree and Cheduba form an integral portion of the province. The area is estimated at 16,500 sq. m., and the population at 321,000. In the S. the mountains rise immediately from the sea-coast, but N. of 19\u00b0 they recede and leave room for a broad plain, prolonged north wards in the valley of the Kuladyne, which is shut off from the coast by a series of heights. This plain is low, swampy, and unhealthy. It produces a large amount of rice, together with a little indigo, cotton, and tobacco. The natives are intelligent and inoffensive. The chief towns are Akyab, the present capital, on a small island of the same name, with a good harbour ; Kyouk Phyoo, on Ramree Island, the chief military station, with a fine harbour, inner and outer ; Aracan, the old capital, on the Kuladyne river, in an unhealthy position, and now in a state of decadence ; and Sandoway, in the southern district. Pegu. \u2014 Pegu is bounded E. by the Saluen, S. by the Gulf of Mar taban, W. by the mountain chain that separates it from Aracan, and N. by Burmah in about 19\u00b0 30' N. lat. It comprises the delta of the Irawaddy, with an area of 10,000 sq. m., the plain or broad valley of that river above the delta, the valley of the Setang, which joins the inmost point of the Gulf of Martaban, and half the valley of the Saluen on the eastern frontier. The area is estimated at 32,000 sq. m., and the population at 1,150,189. The Irawaddy first divides at a distance of about 120 m. from the sea, and subsequently subdivides iigain and again, covering the delta with its ramifications : ultimately its chief channels are tbe BaBsein in the W. and the Rangoon in the E. The climate generally is unhealthy, but at Rangoon it is moderate and healthy : the rainy season falls between April and October. The chief towns are Rangoon, on the eastern estuary of the Irawaddy, 26 m. from the sea, on elevated ground, the depot for the commerce of the Ira waddy and a British military station ; Martaban, a port on the Saluen ; Pegu, the native capital, on a river of the same name which joins the eastern branch of the Irawaddy ; Prome, on the Irawaddy, in the in terior ; Tonghoo, on the Sitang, 83 m. N.E. of Prome, a British mili tary station ; and Thyetmo, another station on the N. frontier. The opening of a commercial route to S.W. China by the course of the Irawaddy would raise Pegu to a high importance. This route would communicate with Talifoo in Yunnan, 220 m. from Bhamo. Another route has been projected between Rangoon and Kiang-Hung on the Cambodia, 480 m. distant. Tenasserim. \u2014 The Teuasserim provinces occupy a narrow strip of coast within the limits already specified, bounded E. by tbe high range which forms the backbone of the peniusula. The surface is generally mountainous, with occasional alluvial plains. The chief river is the Tenasserim, which gains a comparatively lengthy course from running parallel to the mountains. The climate is healthy ; the heat moderate, never exceeding 9u\u00b0 ; and the rainy season falls between May and October. The resources of the country are undeveloped : minerals abound \u2014 tin, iron, antimony, and coal ; the soil is fertde, but the only"], [454, "438 INDIA. Book II. exports at present are rice and teak. The provinces are Amherst, Tavoy, and Mergui, respectively in the N. middle, and S. Of the towns we may notice Moulmein (17,042) in the N., on a peninsula at the junction of the rivers Saluen, Gyne, and Attaran, possessing a good harbour, and readily accessible from Rangoon, Martaban, &c. ; Amherst, at the outlet of the southern estuary of the Saluen, founded by the British in 1826, but now of secondary importance to Moulmein: Tavoy aud Mergui, sea-ports in the provinces named after them. Near the latter is an extensive archipelago, which abounds with edible birds' nests. Straits Settlements. \u2014 The settlement of Malacca consists of a territory about 1000 sq. m. in extent, on which stands the town of the same name. The total population is about 60,000, including 16,000 in the town. Its commerce is trifling, tin being the chief production. Penang is an island off the W. eoast in 5\u00b0 24' N. lat., having an area of 68,482 sq. m., mountainous, wooded, healthy, and remarkably adapted to the growth of spices. Its capital, George Town, lies on the E. side of the island, and has a well protected harbour which is largely visited by vessels trading to the E. Province Wellesley lies on the mainland opposite Penang, with a sea frontage of about 30 m. and a depth inland of from 6 to 10 m. : it produces sugar, pepper, rice, &c. Singapore stands on au island of the same name situated at the very extremity of the Malay Peninsula, from which it is separated by a channel nowhere exceeding 2 m. in width. S. of the island is a broader channel, which is the highroad of Eastern commerce. The island itself is small, having an area of about 275 sq. m., and is mostly covered with forest. Its position, however, renders it invaluable in a commercial and naval point of view. It is the great entrepot for the exchange of European and Indian commodities with the products of Siam, Anam, Borneo, the Philippines, and the Indian Archipelago. The climate, though hot, is healthy. The population (80,792) consists mainly of Chinese and Malays. It is the capital of the Straits Settlements. \u00a7 9. Ceylon. \u2014 The island of Ceylon lies off the S. extremity of the peninsula of Hindostan, between 9\u00b0 50' and 5\u00b0 54' N. lat., 82\u00b0 10' and 79\u00b0 50' E. long. It is almost connected with the mainland by the series of sandbanks knowm as Adam's Bridge, which intervene between the islands of Manaar and Rameswaram in about 9\u00b0 50\" N. lat., and whicb form the line of demarcation between Palk Strait on the N. and the Gulf of Manaar on the S. Ceylon has a length from N. to S. of about 270 m., an extreme breadth of 145 m., an estimated area of 24,664 sq. m., and a population of 1,919,487. Natural Features. \u2014 The outline of Ceylon is regular and bears a close resemblance to a pear with the stalk pointing northwards. The broadest part of the island contains a central mass of highlands and mountains culminating in the points of Pedrotallagalla 1 8280 ft. 1 aud Adam's Peak (7420 ft.) This mass is more or less circular, and lies between 7J 30' and 6\u00b0 45' N. lat. An important offset emanates from its N. extremity and forms the watershed between the Bay of Bengal and the Gulf of Manaar. Extensive plains surround the central mountains, terminating on the sea in a low coast fringed with lagunes. The most important river is the Mahavelli Ganga, which rises on the southern verge of the mountainous region and passes through the very heart of it, first north-"], [455, "Chap. XIX. CEYLON. 439 wards as far as Kandy, then S.E., and finally N.E., reaching the sea near Trincomalee. Lesser rivers radiate from the outer slopes of the mountains and supply abundant means of irrigation to the maritime plains : we may specify the Kalang Ganga, which reaches the sea near Colombo, and the Kalloo Ganga, which reaches It at Caltiira. Adam'a Peak. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The climate of Ceylon is tropical. The heat incidental to its latitude is modified by its insular position, and is generally less than in the maritime parts of Hindostan. The W. coast, being exposed to the S.W. monsoon, has a milder temperature than the opposite side of the island. The variation of the thermometer is nowhere excessive : it ranges at Colombo between 76\u00b0 and 86^\u00b0 ; at Point de Galle, between 70\u00b0 and 87\u00b0 ; and at Trincomalee, between 74 j\u00b0 and 91A\u00b0. The soil is generally fertile, and wherever irrigation is afforded, it supports a prolific vegetation. Large forests and jungles are found in the interior, yielding a number of valuable woods adapted for cabinet work. The staple productions of the island are rice, coffee, cocoa-nuts, areca-nuts, and cinnamon : a large number of other tropical plants i sugar-cane, betel, indigo, tobacco, &c.) are also found there. Cowries and pearls are the most distinctive products of the surrounding seas, and salt is manufactured in the lagunes. Inhabitants, Towns, &c. \u2014 The population of Ceylon is a mixed oue, the different races being distinguished mainly by religion. The Singha lees, who form the dominant element, are Buddhists. The Taniuls of the N. and N.E. are Hindoos. Mohammedans are found everywhere, but especially on the W. central coast. The aborigines, named Veddas or Beddas, are restricted to the forests and mountains, where they live in the lowest state of barbarism. The European population numbers only about 5000. The Singhalese are intelligent, and admit of being highly educated ; their annals go back to 543 B.C., and they retained a certain amount of independence (with Kandy for their capital) until 1815, when ttieir last king was deposed. The island is now divided into six provinces, distinguished as the northern, north-western, western, southern, central, and eastern. Colombo, on the W. coast, ranks as the capital and seat of government: its harbour is poor. Kandy, the old capital, is still the most important town in the interior. Point de Galle,"], [456, "440 INDIA, Book II on the S.W. coast, is the station for the Oriental steam packets ; the harbour is rocky, and the roadstead exposed to certain winds. We may further notice the sea-port towns of Calpentyn, on a peninsula of the W. coast in 8\u00b0 14' N. lat. ; Caltura, on the same coast in 6\u00b0 37' N. lat. ; Trincomalee, on the E. coast in 8\u00b0 33' N. lat., with a splendid land-locked harbour, and a naval dockyard ; Jaffnapatam, on a penin sula at the N. extremity of the island, in which the Dutch still hold their ground ; and Newerra Ellia, on a table land below Pedrotalla galla, at an elevation of 6200 ft. above the sea level, the resort of English invalids. Numerous remains of ancient structures show the former wealth and populousness of the island, such as the ruins of Anaradhapoora and the magnificent reservoir of Kandelly near Trin comalee. Tlie Laccadives and Maldives, \u2014 The Laccadive Archipelago lies at some distance from the western or Malabar coast of Hindostan between 10\u00b0 and 13\u00b0 N. lat., 72\u00b0 and 74\u00b0 E. long. It consists of 17 islands of coral formation, 8 of which only are inhabited, the population amount ing to about 8000 or 10,000. Their chief products are coir for cables, and cocoa-nuts, from the latter of which the natives make the sugar known as jaggery. The islands are partly, if not wholly, a British pos session : 4 of them were owned until recently by the ruler of Cananore on the mainland. The Maldive Islands lie S. of the Laccadives, from which they are separated by the two channels on either side of Minicoy known as the Nine Degrees and the Eight Degrees Channels. The group is situated between 7\u00b0 6' N. lat. and 0\u00b0 40' S. lat., 72\u00b0 48' and 73\u00b0 48 ' E. long., and consists of an infinite number of small coral isles enclosed in atolls or encircling barriers, of which there are 14. The pro ducts of the islands are much the same as those of the Laccadives, with the addition of cowries. The population, estimated at from 150,000 to 200,000, is subject to a sultan, who is on friendly terms with the British government. He resides on the Isle of Mali, from which the name of Maldive is derived, and he rejoices in the official title of Sultan of the Thirteen Atolls and Twelve Thousand Islands. Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\u2014 Two groups of islands lie in the eastern portion of the Bay of Bengal, nearly in a line between the S.W. point of Pegu and the N.W. point of Sumatra, viz. : the Andaman Islands between 13\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 N. lat., and the Nicobar Islands between 9\u00b0 2o' and 6\u00b0 40' N. lat. The former group consists of 3 larger islands, forming an almost continuous line from N. to S., and dis tinguished as North, Middle, and South Andaman, together with a smaller one named Little Andaman, and a number of islets. They are mountainous and densely wooded, and occupied by a remarkably savage people of low stature, engaged in fishing and hunting. The Nicobar group consists of two larger islands distinguished as Great and Little Nicobar, and a number of islets. They resemble the Andamans in physical character, but are occupied by a milder race, who carry on a certain amount of commerce with the Chinese and Malays in the articles of ambergris aud edible birds'-nests. Both the above groups are unhealthy to Europeans. The British endeavoured to settle on the Andamans in 1791, and the Danes on the Nicobars in 1756 and 1768 : but the projects failed in each case. In 1848 the British sent the rebel Sepoys to Port Blair on Chatham island, one of the Andamans, aud they have since formed a considerable convict establishment there under the Madras Presidency."], [457, "Chap. XIX. THE INDO-CHINESE STATES. 441 n. The Indo-Chinese States. \u00a7 10. Burmah, Siam, Laos, Cambodia, and Anam or Cochin- China. \u2014 With the exception of the western coast of Further India, which is subject to the British, and the French acquisitions about Saigon in Cochin-China, the whole of the Indo-Chinese Peninsula is held by independent states, none of which are thoroughly known to us, while of many in the interior not even the names have reached us. The political divisions recognised in our atlases are five, viz. : Burmah, Siam, Laos, Cambodia, and Anam or Cochin-China : the estimated areas and populations of the 3 principal divisions are as follows : \u2014 Burmah. \u2014 Burmah or Birmah is an inland territory bounded W. and S. by the British provinces of Aracan and Pegu, which for merly belonged to it and provided it with an extensive sea-board. Its N. and E. boundaries are undefined : in the former direction it adjoins Assam, and in the latter the Chinese province of Yunnan and Independent Laos. It may be considered as lying between 19\u00b0 30' and 28\u00b0 N. lat., 93\u00b0 and 99\u00b0 E. long., with a length of about 750 m. and a maximum breadth of 220 m. If the Shan States to the Me-kong are included, the E. limit would be placed at 101\u00b0 E. long., and the area would be almost doubled. Burmah proper, in its present reduced dimensions, consists of little else than the basin of the Ira waddy, from its source to a point about 100 m. above the apex of its delta. In its mid course, that river takes a sudden bend to the W. for about 80 m., receiving at the E. extremity of this bend the Myit nge from the Chinese province of Yunnan, and at the W. the Kyan- Duayn, which has a course parallel to the main stream. The plain or broad valley in which this bend is situated, being thus centrally situated in regard to communications, and being also favoured with a rich soil, may be regarded as the very heart of the Burmese Empire. The upper courses of the Setang and the Saluen also fall within its limits, but we know very little of the regions through which they flow. The climate of Burmah is tropical : in the N. the rainy season falls between June and September, and the Irawaddy is in flood during that period : in the lower valley the first or light rains fall in May, and the great rains between August and October : the latter occasionally fail. The re sources of Burmah are great, but few of the products find their way to the sea-board. The chief outlet for the commerce of the country is in tbe direction of China, whither cotton, ivory, birds'-nests, &c, are exported. The population is composed of a great number of tribes using different languages, but all more or less allied to the Siamese : their language is mainly monosyllabic : their religion, Buddhism : their government, an absolute monarchy.

It is bounded E. by Anam and Laos, N. by Burmah, W. by Burmah, the Tenasserim provinces, and the Bay of Bengal, and S. by the Gulf of Siam and the independent Malays in about 4\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 N. lat. The valley of the great river Meinam may be regarded as the heart of the Siamese country : this river is formed by the union of its two branches Nanting-ho and Maepraen in about 22\u00b0 N. lat. : it is said Scene ou the Meiaam. to be connected with the Cambodia by an arm in about 20\u00b0 N. lat. : its lower course lies through au alluvial plain, which is enriched by its in undations ; it reaches the Gulf of Siam through several outlets, the mouths of which are obstructed by bars. The basin of the Meinam is enclosed between two diverging ranges of mountains, the western of which divides it from the Saluen and is prolonged into the Malay penin sula, while the eastern divides it from the Me-kong. The former range is lofty, rugged and covered with forests : that portion of it which enters the peninsula near the Tenasserim river is named Sam- ra got or the \" Three Hundred Peaks.\" It subsides at the Isthmus of Krah, which crosses the peninsula between 8\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 N. lat. S. of the isthmus the mountains again rise and continue in a S.E. direction to the extremity of the peninsula. The climate of Siam is subject to the usual conditions of tropical countries. The rainy season lasts from May to August : the winds are regular according to the prevalent monsoon : and the heat, which is no doubt very excessive in the interior, is moderated on the coast by the sea-breezes. The country abounds in valuable productions, among which we may specify teak,"], [459, "Chap. XIX. CAMBODIA \u2014 COCHIN CHINA. 443 sapan, and aquila wood, the latter used as a perfume by the Chinese ; gamboge and cardamoms ; elephants, tigers, and peacocks ; tin and other metals. The Siamese or Thay, as they call themselves, belong to the Mongol stock, use a monosyllabic language, and profess Buddh ism. The government is a pure autocracy, and is shared between two joint kings, of whom one bas two-thirds, and the other one-third of the power. Manufactures are at a low ebb, and the few that are maintained, such as iron and tin-making, are in the hands of Chinese settler3. The foreign commerce is large, and on the increase : the Meinam is open to all comers, and Bangkok is visited by vessels which carry rice, sugar, black pepper, tobacco, and other products to Singapore and China. The capital, Bangkok, stands on one of the branches of the Meinam : much of it is built on rafts of bamboo. Ayuthia, the former capital, is higher up the river, and is now in ruins. Laos. \u2014 Laos is a mountainous couutry lying W. of the river Me-kong, between 16\u00b0 and 23\u00b0 N. lat., and occupied by a number of independent tribes, belonging to the race of Shan, and comprised under the general name of Laos. Many of them are subject to Siam and Burmah, and the territorial limits of Laos are sometimes carried W. to the Saluen and the Irawaddy : but E. of 101\u00b0 the tribes are independent. Little is known either of them or their country. Various valuable produc tions, gold, musk, ivory, benzoin, &c, find their way from them to Siam and China. Independent Cambodia. \u2014 Cambodia lies between Siam and Cochin- China, stretching from the sea-coast inland to the Me-kong, and contain ing within its limits the Tale-Sap or Great Lake. This region has gene rally been subject to Siam, but in 1863 the French established a pro tectorate over it. The soil is remarkably fertile, and produces coffee, cotton, silk, sugar, rice, and gamboge, which derives its name from Cambodia. The capital, Odung, is on the channel between the lake and the river. There are remarkable ruins of Buddhist temples at Ongcor the Great, N. of the lake, at Nakhon Vat in 13\u00b0 25' N. lat., 103\u00b0 52' E. long., and many other places. Cochin-China or Anam. \u2014 The country variously known as Cochin- China and Anam occupies the eastern portion of the Indo-Chinese Peninsula from the Gulf of Tonquin in the N. to the mouth of the Me kong in the S., aud stretches back inland to the course of this river. Anam is the proper designation of the country, and Cochin-China is merely a division of it ou the E. coast. The Me-kong traverses the country from N. to S. in a course parallel to the E. coast, but shut off from it by an intervening range of mountains. Extensive plains surround both the delta of that river and the course of the Song-ka or Tonquin river, which flows E. to the Gulf of Tonquin. The people belong to the Mongol stock, use a monosyllabic language, and are Buddhists. A wild race in the mountainous parts of the interior is regarded as the aboriginal population. The Auamese are averse to intercourse with strangers : the French have, however, succeeded in establishing a naval and commercial settlement at Saigon, on the S. coast, and have extended their sway over the provinces of Bien-Hoa, Mytho, and Gia-Diuh, aud the isles of Poulo-Condore, off the mouth of the Me-kong, the whole containing an estimated population of lj mil lion. Their position is a valuable one, if they are able to turn it to account. The Me-kong offers a route to Kiang-Hung in China, but the distance of this entrepot from Saigon is 1200 m. Hue, the native capital, is on the E. coast, and was built and fortified by French engineers."], [460, "444 Book II. The Great Wall ol China. CHAPTER XX. CHINA, JAPAN, AND MALAYSIA. I.

Extent, Area, Population, and Divisions. \u2014 The Chinese Empire covers the vast region occupied by the great eastern plateau of Asia, together with the district between the plateau and the Pacific Ocean. It is thus contiguous to Siberia in the N., Turkestan in the W., Hindostan in the S.W., and Burmah and Anam in the S.E., while on the E. it holds the sea-board of the Pacific from the Gulf of Tonquin in the S. to the Russian frontier in 44\u00b0 30' N. lat. Its area is estimated at about 4,700,000 sq m., and its population at 477,500,000. The countries of which it is composed"], [461, "Chap. XX. THE CHINESE EMPIRE. 445 are as follows : \u2014 China Proper, in the S.E. of the empire, on the sea board of the Pacific ; Mantchooria, in the N.E., adjacent to the Amoor ; Mongolia, in the N. and N.W. ; Chinese Turkestan with Dzungaria, in the W. ; and Tibet in the S. In addition to these we may mention Corea, which is tributary to China, though not re garded as part of the empire ; the island of Formosa ; and Bhotan in Hindostan, which is said to be dependent on Tibet. \u00a7 2. China, its Boundaries, Area, and Population. \u2014 China Proper occupies the sea-board of the Pacific from the Golf of Tonquin in the S. to the border of Corea on the Yellow Sea in the N. Its inland boundaries are not well defined by natural features : on the N. it adjoins Mantchooria and Mongolia ; on the W. Turkestan and Tibet ; and on the S. Burmah and Anam. The bulk of the country does not extend beyond 100\u00b0 E. long., and 40\u00b0 N. lat. ; but in the W. a remarkable excrescence has been added to the province of Kansu in the form of a comparatively narrow strip connecting China with the district of Thian-Shan-Peloo in 85\u00b0 E. long. ; and in the N. the province of Leaotong has been severed from Mantchooria and added to China, so that the N. boundary extends as high as 43\u00b0 N. lat. The length of the country, exclusive of the districts just specified, from N. to S. is about 1400 m., its average breadth about 1100 m., and its area about 1,560,500 sq. m. Its population is supposed to amount to 450 millions. The N. frontier of China is defined by a gigantic wall stretching from the shore of the Yellow Sea westward to Kia-yu-kooan on the border of the Han-hai desert in 98\u00b0 E. long. The greater part of it was erected in 213 B.C., to restrain the northern tribes : the western portion, from about 101\u00b0 E. long., is of modern construction, and is designed to protect the great commercial route to the west. A prolongation of it has also been carried northwards by a stockade into Mantchooria. The wall is now in a dilapidated state. \u00a7 3. Natural Features. \u2014 As regards its general physical cha racter, China may be divided into 3 distinct regions : \u2014 (1) A moun tainous country, extending over the whole western half to 110\u00b0 E. long. (2) A plain, lying E. of that limit, and extending from the N. frontier to the Yang-tze-kiang, and S. of that river between Ngan-king and the sea at Hang-choo bay. (3) A hilly country from the Yang tze-kiang to the frontier of Cochin-China. The first is a poor and thinly populated region, containing not one-sixth of the population ; it is dependent on the eastern districts for its supplies of food, and it only yields a certain amount of minerals, particularly coal, which is found chiefly in Se-chuen, along the course of the Yang-tze-kiang. The Plain has a breadth of from 150 to 400 miles, and an area of about 210,000 sq. m. The provinces in this region vary in cha racter ; some are dry and undulating, as is the case with Pe-chi-li in"], [462, "THE CHINESE EMPIRE. Book II. 446 the N., the interior of Shan-tvmg, and the northern portions of Ngan-hoe and Hoo-pe : the coast district of Shan-tung is low and swampy: Kiang-su is profusely watered; and the valley of the Yang-tze-kiang is subject to periodical inundations. The coast of the Gulf of Pe-chi-li is low and sandy, and the section between 35\u00b0 and 30i\u00b0 N. lat. bears the same character : N. of 35\u00b0 to the Gulf of Pe-chi-li it is rocky. The Hilly country consists of ranges of mo derate elevation with well-watered valleys and plains intervening : the coast is high and rocky from 30^\u00b0 N. lat. to the peninsula of Tonquin, and then becomes low and flat. Mountains. \u2014 Four mountain ranges traverse the interior of China, with a general direction from W. to E. They may be regarded as ema nating from the great westerly range of Yun-ling, which runs from S.W. to N.E. between the southerly bend of the Yang-tze-kiang and the northerly one of the Hoang-ho. The four chains are : \u2014 the Yu-ling, which bounds the basin of the Canton river on the S. ; the Nan-ling, which bounds that basin on the N. and extends in a N.E. direction to the sea at Ning-po; tne Tapa-ling, which lies N. of the Yang-tze kiang between it and its tributary the Han-kiang; and the Pe-Iing, which separates the Han-kiang from the Hoai-ho, an affluent ofthe Hoang-ho. In the extreme north-west of China, or that portion of the former Tangut which is now included in Kansu, we come in contact with the ranges connected with the great central plateau of Asia, par ticularly the Kilian-shan and its western prolongation Nan-shan, which lie in the line of the Kuen-lun range, and the mountains of Sifan, which run N. and S. between the upper basins of the Hoang-ho and the Yang-tze-kiang. Rivers, Lakes, and Canals. \u2014 The rivers of China are numerous, and are generally favourable for purposes of internal navigation. The Yang-tze-kiang (\"Son of the Ocean\") traverses the central district, rising on the plateau of Tibet, entering China in the province of Yun nan, and thence pursuing a general N.E. course to the sea, breaking through the mountain chain3 between I-chang and Wan by a series of magnificent gorges with a rapid and confined stream, and finally winding through the Great Plain in a channel which requires to be kept in its place by artificial embankments. It is navigable for sea-going ships to I-chang, and for river-steamers - to Chong-kin in Seehuen. It receives in its mid-course the overflow of two large lakes, Tonting-hou and Po yang-hou, and has numerous affluents, of which we may notice the Han-kiang, which joins it at Hankow, and the Woo-sung on which Shang-hae stands. The Hoang-ho or Yellow River rises near the Yang tze-kiang, and traverses a more northerly part of China : it is an ex tremely unmanageable stream, and is so destructive to the adjacent lands on the Plain, that it is named by the Chinese the \"grief of the sons of Honan :\" it usually discharges itself into the Yellow Sea, but it has lately worked out for itself a new channel to the Gulf of Pe-chi-li. The Pei-ho, flowing into the Gulf of Pe-chi-li, is of import ance as the river which leads up iu the direction of Pekin : it has a bar at its mouth, and is frozen over in the winter. The Choo-kiang or Canton river is the common embouchure of the Pe-kiang and Si-kiang; vessels of 1000 tons reach Canton, and the Pe-kiang is navigable for about 300 m. inland. An extensive system of internal navigation has"], [463, "Chap. XX. CHINA. 447 been organized by means of the Grand Canal, constructed partly in the 7th, and partly (the N. section) in the 13th centuries of our era; it commences at Hang-cheou-foo in 30\u00b0 N. lat., and terminates, after a course of 700 m., on the Eu-hc in 37\u00b0 N. lat. \u00a7 4. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The climate of China is cha racterized by extremes of heat and cold, the latter being in excess as compared with European countries in similar latitudes. Pekin, for instance, has a lower mean temperature by 9\u00b0 than Naples. Rain falls heavily in the latter part of April and May, before which the cold and after which the heat is excessive. The soil of China is on the whole remarkably productive. The Great Plain produces cereals and vegetables in abundance, and portions of it (Kiang-su and Sha-sze on the Yang-tze. Ngan-whi) add to these tobacco, cotton, and tea. The hilly country in the S.E. produces the best kinds of tea and rice, the former plant thriving best on the slopes on account of the facility for drainage, the latter in the low clayey bottoms which admit of being easily flooded. Large quantities of silk are also produced in this district, the water-courses and rivers being lined with mulberry- trees. Tea is principally grown in Fo-kien, Ngan-whi, Che-kiang, Kiang-sn, and tho W. of Quang-tung ; cotton principally in Che-kiang and Kiang-su ; and silk in the well watered provinces of Hoo-pe, Ngan whi, Kiang-su, and Che-kiang. Bituminous coal is found in tho interior provinces of Kiang-si and Hoo-nan, and anthracite in Shan se : very small quantities of it are used by the natives. The best iron-ore is found in Shan-se, and of this also a very small amount"], [464, "448 THE CHINESE EMPIRE. Book II. is worked up into metal. The chief silver-mines are in the S.W. province, Yun-nan ; Shan-se and Shan-tung in the N. are also said to produce this metal ; gold in small quantities is found in the river beds of Yun-nan and Se-chuen, and it is to this feature that the upper course of the Yang-tze-kiang owes its name of Kincha-kiang, \" Golden-sand river.\" \u00a7 5. Inhabitants, Government, Occupations, and Commerce. \u2014 The Chinese belong to the Mongolian stock, but they differ in many respects from the true Mongols. They use a monosyllabic language, and a symbolical system of writing, in which every word is represented by a special sign. The Chinese are simple in their tastes and manners, industrious, and ingenious ; adepts at dis simulation, and unscrupulous in regard to their engagements ; averse to foreign innovations, and supremely satisfied with their own system. In religion the majority are Buddhists; but the earlier system of Taou or \" Rationalism,\" promulgated in the 6th century B.C., still holds its ground, and the pantheistic creed of Confucius is held by a large number of persons of the upper class. The Chinese are well educated after their .own fashion, and they appear to have anticipated Europeans in many discoveries, such as the mariner's compass, printing, and gunpowder. Government. \u2014 The government of China is professedly an autocracy, the emperor being the sole depositary of power. Practically, however, the emperor's influence is restricted, and a large amount of independent local government is carried on in the interior of the country. The causes which lead to this result are the paramount authority of custom and precedent in all that concerns the acts of the emperor ; the distri bution of all public offices on the ground of literary acquirements, as ascertained by public competitive examinations ; the unwarlike tastes of the people, whicb present an obstacle to the maintenance of a stand ing army commensurate to the requirements of the country ; and the hereditary attachment to patriarchal institutions among the agricul turists. Added to this, the present dynasty, which is of Tartar origin and obtained power in the 1 7th century, is supposed to be drawing to its close, and has lost the prestige of power. Occupations. \u2014 The Chinese are for the most part agriculturists : they produce their own meat, drink, and clothing, rice constituting their staple diet, with fish, pigs, and poultry as accessories, tea their uni versal drink, and cotton their equally universal clothing. Manufactures are chiefly domestic ; silk and porcelain are the most valuable products, and the Chinese exhibit great skill in cabinet work, japanned and lacquered ware, carvings in wood and ivory, and the construction of toys and puzzles. Commerce. \u2014 The chief exports from China are tea and raw silk, the bulk of which are shipped to Great Britain. A large amount of cotton was also sent out during the American civil war. The chief imports are cotton goods, woollens, and opium from India ; and among the minor articles may be mentioned the edible birds'-nests and the beche de-mer, which are highly prized in Chinese cookeiy. The maritime commerce is chiefly in the hands of foreigners, whose vessels are swifter"], [465, "Chap. XX. CHINA. 449 and safer than the native junks. A large inland traffic is carried on with Eussia through Kiakhta, and with Tibet and Turkestan, tea being given in exchange for furs, hides, woollen and linen fabrics, and sundries. \u00a7 6. Political Divisions, Towns, Islands.\u2014 China is divided into 19 provinces, inclusive of Leaotong, which is an appanage of the Imperial family, though not included in China Proper. The provinces may be distributed into 3 groups : \u2014 (1) 7 maritime, from N. to S. : Leaotong, Pe-chi-li, Shan- tung, Kiang-su, Che-kiang, Fo-kien, and Quang-tung. (2) 6 on the frontiers : S., Quang-si and Yun-nan ; W., Se-chuen and Kan-su ; and N., Shen-se and Shan-se. (3) 6 interior : Ho-nan, Ngan-whi, Kiang-si, Hoo-nan, Hoo-pe, and Quei-chow. The towns are both numerous and po pulous : the affixes foo, chow, and Men indicate their political posi tions as capitals of the various subdivisions of the provinces, and may be taken as equivalent to towns of the first, second, and third class respectively. The plan on which the towns are built is toler ably uniform : they are generally quadrangular, surrounded by walls flanked with towers, the main streets regular and broad, the side streets narrow and with one-storied huts, the public buildings ex tensive rather than beautiful, the peculiar feature in Chinese archi tecture being the erection of towers of many stories with their subdivisions prominently apparent on the exterior. Our acquaint ance with the Chinese towns is almost wholly confined to the Treaty-ports : of these 5 were opened to foreign commerce by the Treaty of Nan-king in 1842, viz. : \u2014 Canton, Amoy, Foo-chow, Ning-po, and Shang-hae; and 7 by the Treaty of Tien-tsin, in 1858, viz. : \u2014 Swatow, Hankow, Chin-kiang, Kew-kiang, Teng-chow, Tien-tsin, and New-chwang. Chefoo, on the Gulf of Pe-chi-li, is also practically open, being held by the French. Towns. \u2014 Peking, the present capital, stands on a plain about 50 m. S. of the Great Wall and near the Pei-ho, with which it is connected by a canal : it has a circumference of 25 m., much of the enclosed area being occupied by gardens : it is divided into two great portions, a southern or commercial city, and a northern or Tartar city, the latter of which is again subdivided into 3 parts and contains the Imperial palace, the Government offices, and other public buildings. Pekin was cap tured by the British and French in 1860. The population is esti mated at two millions. Nan-king, the former capital down to the 13th century, and the seat of the Ming dynasty, stands on a branch of the Yang-tze-kiang about 250 m. from the sea : it is now little more than a heap of ruins in consequence of its having been held by the Tae-pings : the famous Porcelain Tower, 200 ft. high and in 9 stories, is no more, and the only object of interest is the burial place of the Miug dynasty with its avenue of sculptured figures. Shang-hae, on the Woo-sung, is now the first commercial port in the empire, and owes its rise -partly to its geographical position as the outlet for the basin of the Yang-tze-kiang, and partly to the settlement of British"], [466, "THE CHINESE EMPIRE. Book II. 450 merchants there. Foo-chow, on the Min, which is here crossed by a fine bridge of 33 arches, holds the second place, being the chief place for the shipment of black tea : large vessels cannot approach nearer than 7 m. from it. Han-kow, 700 m. up the Yang-tze-kiang, is rapidly Chinese Bridge near Peking. rising to importance since the navigation of the river has been thrown open : it stands at the mouth of the Han, with Han-yang on the oppo- site side of the Han, and Woo-chang on the opposite side of the Yang- tze, the 3 together containing a vast population, brought together by the centrality of the position for internal commerce. Canton (1,210,000) holds the fourth place among the cities of the empire: previously to the opening of the northern forts it was the chief seat of European commerce, and it figures largely in the history of the British wars, having been attacked in 184-1, 1847, and 1856, and occupied from 1858 to 1862. Amoy (250,000 - is on an island opposite Formosa, 320 m. N. of Canton, and serves as the port of Chang-chow ; a century back it was the chief seat of British commerce : it was captured by the British in 1841. Ning-Po, on the Takia, about 12 m. from the sea, exports tea and silk, and has a literary reputation : it was taken by the British in 18tl, and rescued from the Tae-pings in 1862. Swatow, 220 m. N. of Canton, is engaged in importing opium, and exporting rice and sugar. Tien-tsin, the port of Peking, stands on the Peiho, 45 m. from its mouth : it has a large trade in salt, but the river- approach to it is tortuous and frozen up in the winter. Of the other Treaty-ports, Chin-kiang and Kew-kiang, on the Yang-tze, are at present in ruins ; Tang-chow, on the Gulf of Pe-chi-li, is much ex posed; and New-Chwang, on the Gulf of Leaotong, is remote and little frequented. Kin-kiang, iu the province of Che-kiang, is a rising port,"], [467, "Chap. XX. ISLANDS. 451 connected with the green tea district. We may further notice Tsi-nan, the capital of Shan-tung, famed for its silks ; Soo-chow, W. of Shang hae, the centre of a district so fertile as to be denominated by the Chinese the \"terrestrial Paradise;\" Hang-chow, the capital of Che kiang, with a million of inhabitants fit is said), large manufactures of silk and cotton, and an extensive internal and foreign commerce ; Ching-too, the capital of Se-chuen, on the great road to Tibet, and sur rounded by a mineral district ; Si-ngan, the capital of Shen-se, one of the largest towns of China, and famous for a cross with an inscription found here in 1625, dating from the period of the Nestorian mission ; Nan-chang, the capital of Kiang-si, famed for its porcelain ; and Chang-sha, the capital of Hoo-nan, in a fertile district regarded as the \" garden of China.\" Islands. \u2014 Off the coast of China lie the large islands of Formosa and Hainan, together with a multitude of lesser ones of all sizes, among which Hong-kong and the Chusan islands hold the most important place. Formosa lies between 22\u00b0 and 25\u00b0 15' N. lat., and has a length from N. to S. of about 240 m., with a maximum breadth of about 100 m. A broad and lofty range of volcanic mountains, named Ta-Shan, traverses its whole length in greater proximity to the E. than to the W. coast. The ports are inaccessible for vessels ' of any size from sandbanks and bars at the river mouths. The soil is fertile ; rice, tea, camphor, sugar, and jute are among its productions. The popu lation is a mixed one of Chinese and aborigines, the latter having some affinity to the Malays. The capital, Taiwan, was occupied by the Dutch in 1634-1662: it carries on a considerable trade with China. Formosa is attached to the province of Fo-kien. Hainan lies off tho S. point of Quan-tong, the Channel of the Junks intervening with a breadth of about 15 m. : the island has a length of 170 m., and a maximum breadth of 100 m. A lofty range of mountains, named Ta- Utshi-shan, traverses it from S.W. to N.E., having rich plains on each side. The soil is remarkably fertile. Sandal- wood, ebouy, rosewood, and a fine white wax, are among the productions. Its chief port is Eien-chow, on the N. coast. Hong-kong is a small island 8 m. long and from 2 to 6 m. broad, lying off the mouth of the Canton river, and separated from the mainland by a narrow channel. It is rocky and barren, but it possesses good harbourage, and is on this account, com bined with its position, of great value to us. The chief town, Victoria, is situated on the N. side of the island. The British became possessed of this island in 1842. A sanatory station at Kow-loon, on the opposite mainland, is appended to Hong-Kong. Macao is a Portuguese settle ment on a peninsula of the island of Heong-shan, at the S. entrance of the Canton river : the Portuguese have held it since 1586, and Camoens here wrote part of the Lusiad. The Chusan islands form a very nume rous group, situated in 30\u00b0 N. lat., nearly opposite Ning-po, the largest of them beiug about 30 m. long. They are of great value to China, both as commanding the line of coast, and as facilitating commerce with Japan. The Pescadore islands lie off the W. coast of Formosa: coal has been discovered on the largest of them. 1 British stripping frequents the mouth of the Tamsuy river on the N.W. coast, wbere vessels drawing 16 ft. can enter. Tai- wan, which was opened by the Treaty of Tien-tsin, has its harbour Eilted up. Coal-mines (ligu\"W0 are worked near Tamsuy Harbour, and on the N. coast, near Kelung Harbour."], [468, "452 THE CHINESE EMPIRE. Book II. \u00a7 7. Mantchooria. \u2014 Mantchooria occupies the N.E. angle of the Chinese empire, extending along the coast of the Pacific between the frontiers of the Russian Empire and Corea. Its boundaries are not easily defined : formerly it reached S. to the Yellow Sea, but the province of Leaotong in this quarter has been disjoined from it : its W. limit is generally fixed at the Khinghan range, separating it from Mongolia, but as the plain of Cortchin to the E. of this ran^e is occupied by Mongols, it would seem more correct to place the boundary further eastward : in the N. it extends to the Amoor, except as regards the lower course of the river which now belongs to Russia. Its area is estimated at 492,000 sq. m. and its population at 3 millions, Leaotong, however, being included in these estimates. Little is known of this country. A lofty range of mountains, skirt ing the coast northwards from Victoria Bay, completely shuts off the interior. Southwards of this point the range recedes somewhat inland, and under the names of Shan-Alin and Tsi-ynng-shan penetrates be tween the Yellow Sea and the Gulf of Leaotong. The inland chain of Khinghan appears to be connected with the Yablonoi system. The chief rivers are the Amoor and its tributary the Soongari. The plain of Cortchin has the same character as the Great Desert of Gobi, but is somewhat less barren. Eastward of the plain the country is broken up into mountains and valleys. The Mantchoos belong to the Tun goose race, and are an agricultural people. The present reigning dynasty in China is of Mantchoo origin. The distinctive productions of the country are ginseng and rhubarb, the argali or wild sheep, and the ashiggetai or wild ass. The chief towns are Kirin ooia in the interior, on the Soongari, which is navigable up to this point, the Beat of the governor, and Saghalien-oola, a place of large trade on the Amoor. \u00a7 8. Corea. \u2014 Corea consists of a peninsula extending southwards for about 420 m., between the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea, together with the adjacent mainland to the N. for about 200 m. It is separated from Kiu-siu, the nearest of the Japan islands, by the Corea Strait. Its area is estimated at 87,760 m., and its population at 9 millions. A range of mountains traverses the peninsula in its length at no great distance from tbe E. coast : northwards this is connected with another chain named Chang-pe-shan, which separates Corea from Mantchooria. The eoast is generally high and inaccessible. The chief river is the Toumen-Kiang in the northern district. The climate is severe, but the soil is fertile and well cultivated. The Coreans belong to the Mongol race, and appear to be an exclusive but cultivated people, with a literature of their own and a written language which differs from the Chinese in being alphabetic instead of symbolic. They carry on trade with China and Japan, exporting ginseng, cotton-cloth, cotton-paper, cutlery, silk, and tobacco. Tbe government is an abso lute monarchy. Tribute is paid at stated periods both to Chiua and Japan. The capital, King-ki-tao, is centrally situated. The W. coast is fringed with an amazing number of islets known as the Corean Archipelago."], [469, "Chap. XX. MONGOLIA \u2014 TURKESTAN. 453 \u00a7 9. Mongolia. \u2014 Mongolia extends over an immense district of Central Asia, between Mantchooria in the E., China Proper in the S., the Chinese provinces of Kan-su and Thian-Shan-Peloo in the S.W., Turkestan in the W., and Siberia in the N.W. and N. Its extreme limits may be placed at 38\u00b0 and 53\u00b0 N. lat., 84\u00b0 and 124\u00b0 E. long., the distance between these points from W. to E. being about 1700 m., and from N. to S. about 1000 m. ; the area is about 1,304,000 sq. m., and the population 3 millions. The Great Desert of Shamo or Gobi may be regarded as the heart of the Mongol country, between which and the Siberian frontier lies a mountainous, wooded, fertile, but uncultivated district some 200 m. wide, traversed by the ramifications of the Altai, while to tbe S.E. of it a varied and mountainous region, terminating in the Ala shan range, intervenes between it and China Proper. The mountain chains which fall wholly within the limits of Mongolia are In-shan, a continuation of Ala-shan, to the N. of the groat bend of the Hoang-ho, the Khin-ghan range in the E. on the side of Mautchooria, aud the central and southern branches of the Altai range ( Tangnu-oola, aud Ektag-oola) in the N. W. The rivers that take their rise in this vast region belong for the most part to the Arctic basin, the headwaters of the Irtish, the Yenisei, and the Selenga which feeds Lake Baikal, being all found S. of the Siberian frontier : in the E., however, the Kerlon and the Onon seek the Pacific through the Amoor, while in the W. the rivers not unfrequently fall into large lakes without outlets, as the Urungu into Lake Kizilbash, and the Djabekan iuto Lake Ike-Aral-Nor. The Great Desert of Gobi is a sandy, woodless, and generally flat district, covered for a few weeks in spring with a luxuriant herbage, but at other times barren, and exposed to extreme cold and cutting winds in winter. The whole of Mongolia indeed is very cold and dry, and seldom is there any attempt at agriculture. The Mongols lead a nomadic life, and depend entirely on their herds of camels, horses, and Bheep. They are not confined strictly to Mongolia, but are also found about Foko-nor and in western Tibet. The Calmucks are a branch of the Mongols in the N.W. in the direction of Lake Balkash. The Mongols proper are divided into three nations, the Khalkas of the N., the Sunnit of the Great Desert, and the Tshakhar of the S. They are further divided into 26 tribes or \" aimaks,\" each under an hereditary prince, and again into 135 banners, the former being the civil, the latter the military arrangement. The Khalkas form only a single *' a'imak,\" but differ from the rest in having 4 hereditary princes. A large caravan traffic is carried on across the Desert of Gobi from China to Maimatchin on the Russian frontier, opposite to Kiakhta in Siberia. The capital of Mongolia is Ourga, S. of Maimatchin, the residence of the lamas or Buddhist priests. In the W., Kobdo, on Lake Ike- Aral-Nor, and Ouliassutai more to the E., are places of considerable trade. \u00a7 10. Turkestan. \u2014 Chinese Turkestan and Dzungaria are the dis tricts lying respectively S. and N. of the Thian-shan range at the extreme W. of the Chinese Empire, adjoining Independent Turkestan. The names above given bespeak the dominant population, the Turks or Tartars in the one, and the Dzungaries, a branch of the Calmucks,"], [470, "454 THE CHINESE EMPIRE. Book II, in the other. The two districts are likewise called Thian-Shan- Nanioo and Thian-Shan-Peloo, referring respectively to the roads south and north of Thian-Shan, names which describe their position relatively to the mountain-chain of Thian-Shan, and on the great inland routes that connect Eastern with Western Asia: for it is through these districts that the stream of commerce finds its way from China to the plains of the Caspian and of the Euphrates. So valuable are these routes that the Chinese government have included within the limits of one of their provinces (Kan-su) a long narrow strip extending from the Great Wall into Thian-Shan- Peloo. The joint areas of these countries are estimated at 596,500 sq. m., and their populations at one million. Of the great range of Thian-shan, the \" Celestial Mts.,\" we know as yet but very little. It rises to the region of eternal snow, and the snow-line lies at about 12,000 ft. Alpine glaciers have been seen on Tengri-Tagh, one of its highest summits. The existence of the volcanoes noticed in p. 25 has been questioned ; but solfataras are found there, from which the Chinese procure sulphur. On the S., Turkestan is sepa rated from India by the lofty range of Karakoram, which culminates in Dipsang (28,278) ft.), and is crossed by the Mustakh Pass at the amazing elevation of 18,435 ft., the only pass as yet discovered in the range. (1) Dzungaria or Thian-shan-peloo is rugged with the various chains that intervene between Thian-shan and the Altai. It contains nu merous lakes, the receptacles of the rivers. The chief river is the Iii, falling into Lake Balkash, which stands on the edge of the district. The population is a mixed one \u2014 Khirgiz Cossacks in the west ; Calmucks of various tribes, particularly Tunguuts, elsewhere ; and a sprinkling of Chinese and Mongols. The chief towns are Iii or Guldja, on the Hi, the capital of the province of Hi, and one of the chief seats of traffic with Eussia, with about 80,000 inhabitants ; Chuguchak or Tarbagatai, a town of similar character, but less populous, more N. and close to the Russian frontier ; and Barkol and Urumtsi in that portion of Kan-su which falls within the limits of Dzungaria. (2) Turkestan or Thian -shan-nanloo lies between the ranges of Thian-Shan on the N. and Kuenlun on the S., and extends from the highland of Pamir that connects these two ranges in the W. to the frontier of the Chinese province Kan-su in about 96\u00b0 E. long. Its length from E. to W. may be about 1250 m., and its breadth on the eastern frontier about half that amount : in the extreme W. it con tracts to a point. The greater part of this area is a desert plain, the limits of which may be placed between 81\u00b0 and 96\u00b0 E. long , 37\u00b0 and 42\u00b0 N. lat. : the most arid part lies E. of 8s\u00b0 E. long., and is known as the Han hai or \" Dry Sea.\" The elevation of this plain is about 2000 ft. above the sea-level. To the W. and N. of the limits assigned to the plain, cultivable regions exist along the base of Thiau-Shan and in the valleys watered by the various branches of the Tarim. The Tarim rises in Lake Kara-kol on the highland of Pamir, receives the whole drainage of the western district, and discharges itself after a"], [471, "Chap. XX. TURKESTAN.\u2014 TIBET. 455 course of some 1500 m. into a large lake named Lob-Nor in the heart of the 9esert. The commercial routes which give this country its importance may be said to centre in Cashgar, situated in the angle formed by Thian-Shan and Pamir. The eastern or China road skirts the southern edge of Thian-Shan, passing through the commercial towns of Aksu. Kutcha, Karashar, Turfan, and Pijan to Hami. nn the edge of the Han-hai. Two western routes cross Pamir, one to Bokhara, the other by Kara-kol to Balk and Kunduz. A southerly route leads to Yarkand and thence either across the Karakoram Mountains to Ladakh in the valley of the Indus, or across Kuenlun by Khoten and Kiria to Lassa in Tibet. Finally, a route crosses Thian-shan from Aksu to the valley of the Hi. The population consists of a hybrid stock, half Kirghiz, half Persian, with an admixture of Calmucks, Chinese, and Toonghanese of Chinese extraction, but professing Mohamme danism. Of the commercial towns above mentioned the chief are Yarkand, Cashgar, Khoten, and Aksu: these have abjured the Chiuese supremacy, but have not substituted any stable government in its place. The chief productions of the country are silk, cotton, horses, yew-stone or jade, and wool. The manufactures are woollen and silk. \u00a7 11. Tibet. \u2014 Chinese Tibet (to the exclusion of Little Tibet and the bulk of Ladakh) lies in the angle formed by the convergence of the Kuen-lun and Himalaya ranges and thence expands eastward to the W. frontier of China in about 100\u00b0 to 103\u00b0 E. long. It probably includes the almost unknown district about Koko-Nor in 37\u00b0 N. lat., 100\u00b0 E. long. The length of the country is about 1500 m., and its area about 651,700 sq. m. ; its population is variously esti mated at from 11 to Z\\ millions. Tibet is a table-land of great elevation, covered by rugged masses of mountains in almost every direction. The western portions are the highest, and here the plateau occasionally attains an elevation of 16,000 ft. above the sea-level, the mountains rising of course far above that level. The average height of the great high road between Lassa aud Gartokh for a distance of 800 m. is 14,000 ft., occasionally rising to 16,000 ft., and only once descending to 11,000 ft. Lassa itself is 11,700 ft. above the sea. Little is known of the interior. An im portant chain of mountains traverses the country diagonally from S.W. to N.E., bounding the valley of the San-po on the N., and proceeding towards the eastern extremity of Kuenlun : it strikes the Yang-tze kiang in about 96\u00b0 E. long., and there bifurcates, one branch descend ing southwards to the W. of that river, and known as the Mang-li range, the other crossing the river and entering China, where it forms the watershed between the great basins of the Hoang-ho and the Yang tze-kiang. Numerous lakes are enclosed by these ranges in Central Tibet, of which Tengri-Nor is the largest. The sources of many of the largest rivers of Asia are found in Tibet : in the S.W. the Indus and the Sutleje traverse high valleys between parallel ranges of Hima laya : between this range and the diagonal range above noticed is the wide valley of the San-po or Dzang-bo, probably the upper stream of the Brahmapootra : the Yangtze kiang rises in the very heart of Tibet near 9o\u00b0 E. long., and the Hoang-ho penetrates to about 97\u00b0 E. long., in close proximity to the upper course of the river just mentioned : in the S. are feeders of the Irawaddy and the Me-kong. The climate"], [472, "456 JAPAN Boos II, of Tibet is generally severe in consequence of its great elevation. Its special productions are the yak, the argali, fine-fleeced goats, many precious stones, and borax. A large traffic is carried on with China in one direction, Nepaul, Bhotan, and Turkestan in the other. The Tibetans are Mongols, and are famous for their support of Buddhism. The internal government is to a great extent sacerdotal, the highest native functionaries being the chief priest, or Tale'-Lama, and the second priest or Bogdo-Lama ; the former resides at the capital Lassa, and governs the eastern and north-eastern districts ; the latter at Teshoo-Loomboo, to the S.W. of Lassa, and governs the western divi sion. The priests are said to number 80,000. II. Japan. \u00a7 12. Empire of Japan. \u2014 Japan consists of the three Imperial islands of Niphon, Kiusiu, and Sikok, and the dependencies Yesso, a portion of Saghalien, the two southern of the Kurile Islands, and an almost infinite number of islets. The total area of the islands is estimated at 149,395 sq. m., and the population at 35 millions. The series taken as a whole assumes the form of a crescent, the horns almost touching the mainland at the mouth of the Amoor in the N. and the peninsula of Corea in the S., while between these points the outward curve of the islands, being met by a correspond ing inward curve of the mainland, leaves room for the intervening Sea of Japan. The outer curve of the crescent faces the Sea of Okhotsk in the N., and the Pacific in the S., with the former of which the Sea of Japan is connected by the Gulf of Tartary between Saghalien and the mainland, and by La Perouse Strait between Saghalien and Yesso : and with the Pacific, by the Strait of Tsugar or Sangar, between Yesso and Niphon, as well as by the tortuous channels between Niphon and the islands to the S. of it. The 3 chief islands lie in close proximity to each other, Sikok encircled on all sides except the S.E. by the two others. Between the three lies the Inland Sea, to which access is gained from the \"W. by the Strait of Simonosaki. The comparative size of the main islands may be gathered from the following table : \u2014 Natural Features, Climate and Productions. \u2014 The Japanese islands are for the most part mountainous, with irregular deeply indented coasts; they abound in picturesque scenery, and possess a rich and well-cultivated soil.

The mountains appear to be thrown about irregularly over the surface of the islands, the only prolonged chain with which we are acquainted being in the N. of Niphon. The volcanic height of Fusi-yama (14,177 ft.), 80 m. S.W. of Yeddo, is a conspicuous object from the surrounding coasts. The rivers have necessarily short courses with violent streams. Plains of varying size line the coast, and are occasionally met with ill the interior. These, as well as the hill sides, are carefully cultivated, and yield every kind of vegetable and cereal in astonishing abundance. Tea, ginger, batatas, the soy bean (dolichos soja), tobacco, pepper, cotton, and silk, are among the special productions of the country. The pre cious metals are found there ; coal-fields have been discovered on Yeddo near Hiogo and at Iwanai ; and the surrounding seas yield pearls and ambergris. Fasi-yama. \u00a7 13. Inhabitants. \u2014 The Japanese are regarded as a branch of the great Mongol stock ; they differ, however, in every respect, par ticularly in language and institutions, from the Chinese, with whom their geographical position seems to connect them. They are a remarkably ingenious race, excelling in every kind of mechanical art and readily acquiring the advanced ideas of Western Europe. Their cutlery, silk manufactures, public roads, and lacquer-ware may be adduced in illustration of their native ingenuity; their success in gunnery and their ready adoption of steam-power and the electric telegraph, prove their aptitude in acquiring foreign im provements. In private life the Japanese are remarkable for courtesy and dignified bearing, as well as for untruthfulness and dissoluteness. mod. geo. x"], [474, "458 JAPAN, Book II, Government. \u2014 The political arrangements of the Japanese are peculiar. Nominally tbe form of government is a sacerdotal empire, the supreme authority being vested in the Mikado, who is at once emperor and high priest, but is not permitted to appear in public or to exercise any control over the executive department of the State. Subject, in theory, to the Mikado, but practically independent of him, is the Tycoon, who manages the financial, military, and foreign affairs, and is thus virtually the sovereign of the country. The power of the Tycoon is, however, Beriously impaired by the influence of the Daimios or native princes, who possess enormous landed estates, and are sufficiently wealthy to exercise sovereign rights within their own territories. There are in all 264 of these Daimios, of whom 18 rank as independent sovereigns, while tbe remainder are more or less powerful according to the extent of their estates. The Daimios are the body whence the Great Council of State and the administrative officers are drawn, and their power converts the government into an aristocracy. The Daimios are ex tremely hostile to foreigners, and entertain a great contempt for the merchant class. Their position relatively to the governing power very much resembles that of the nobles under the European feudal system. Religion. \u2014 Buddhism is the prevailing religion : but the indigenous worship of the country is connected with the sun, and is termed Sin sin, or Sinto : the doctrines of Confucius have also a certain number of adherents. Commerce. \u2014 The traditional policy of the Japanese has been one of rigid exclusiveness. They have resisted to the last degree the intrusion of foreigners, and have aimed at making their country self-sufficient for all purposes. The Dutch aud the Chinese were formerly the only nations with whom commerce was permitted, and this only under severe restrictions, each being confined to the circuit of a small island near Nagasaki on Kiu-siu. In 1854 the Americans succeeded in gaining access to the port of Simoda ; in 1 858 the English did the same in refer ence to the ports of Hakodadi, Yokohama near Yeddo, and Nagasaki; finally, in 1868, Hiogo and Osacca were opened. Foreign commerce has already made immense progress in spite of the opposition ofthe Daimios. The exports consist of raw silk, tea, cotton, lacquered ware, tobacco, oil, &c. ; and the imports of woollens, cottons, yarn, and machinery. Political Divisions and Towns. \u2014 Japan is divided into 8 provinces, which are again subdivided into counties and districts. The towns are numerous and very populous. Yeddo, the capital, stands at the head of a deep gulf on the S.W. coast of Niphon : it covers an enormous extent of ground, having a length of 12 and a breadth of 10 miles ; but, as about two-thirds of this space are occupied with gardens and open squares, its population cannot be accurately ascertained : it probably amounts to 1| milliun. Tbe citadel or residence of the Tycoon occu pies an inclosure about 8 m, in circumference. Canals, lined with rows of trees, traverse the main streets. We may further notice Miako, the residence of the Mikado, in the S. of Niphon, about 20 m. from the port of Osacca, the seat of various manufacturing and educa tional establishments, and with a population of about half a million ; Osacca, at the mouth of the Yodogawa, a most active manufacturing town, and also a place of great gaiety ; Nagasaki, on the W. coast of Kiusiu, aud so the nearest port to China, the chief station for foreign commerce ; Yokohama, the station of the British fleet ; Hiogo, 18 m. from Osacca, with an excellent port ; Kagosima in the S. of Kiusiu, destroyed by the British fleet in 1864 ; Matsumai, the chief town of Yesso; and Hakodadi, the open port near it."], [475, "INDIAN ARCHIPELAGO. 459 Chap. XX. The Loo-choo Islands. \u2014 The Loo-choo or lieou-kieou Islands are a group of islands S. of Kiu-siu, extending in a line towards Formosa, and forming the division between the Eastern Sea and the Pacific. They are probably of volcanic origin, and are generally mountainous. The large.-t of the group is about 60 m. long by 1 1 m. broad, and is named Great Loo-choo. Little is known of the islands or their inha bitants. Commercial intercourse is carried on both with China and Japan, but it is uncertain whether either of these powers claims the sovereignty of the islands. Sugar, salt, and sulphur, are the chief ex ports. Vegetables and fruit of every kind are grown in abundance. \u00a7 14. Malaysia, or the Indian Archipelago. \u2014 Intimately con nected with the continent of Asia, and more especially with that portion of it which we have described in the present chapter, is that large group of islands known to us as the Eastern or Indian Archi pelago, and to continental geographers as Malaysia. The group lies between 11\u00b0 S. and 19\u00b0 N. lat., and 95\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 E. long., and assumes a more or less triangular form with the Philippines at the apex, and the long line of the Sunda Islands as the base, Borneo, Celebes, and the Moluccas, occupying the intermediate space. The Sunda Islands are divided into two groups, the Greater Sunda Islands \u2014 viz., Sumatra and Java, with their dependencies ; and the Lesser Sunda1 Islands, comprising all that lie E. of Java, Timor being the chief. The group forms the division between the China Sea and the Pacific, as well as between the Pacific and the Indian Ocean. The intermediate seas and straits are chiefly these : \u2014 the Sooloo or Mindoro Sea, between the Philippines and Borneo ; the Celebes Sea, N. of the island of the same name ; and the Java Sea, connected with the Celebes Sea by Maccassar Strait, and with the Indian Ocean by the Strait of Sunda between Sumatra and Java. Position, Form, Area, and Population. \u2014 The Sunda Islands owe their existence and their peculiar elongated forms to volcanic agency. They mark a volcanic zone, which commences in the Banda Isles S. ofthe Moluccas, and curves round in the direction of the Malay Peninsula. Nowhere is this atrency more powerful or more terrible iu its effects : Java is constantly disturbed by eruptions, and in 1772 3000 lives were lost by the subsidence of a great mountain : Sumbawa was the scene of a frightful catastrophe in 1814, when the town of Tomboro was sub merged by a mighty wave. Another zone starting nearly from the eastern extremity of the one already noticed, may be traced northwards through Gilolo in the Moluccas to the Philippiues. Celebes is con spicuous by its singularly contorted form, consisting of four peninsulas of great length meeting at a central point, but without any central mass of proportionate size. The same description applies to Gilolo, the chief of the Moluccas. Borneo approaches to a triangular form, the apex pointing northwards, and the base facing the S.W. The Philip pines extend N. and S., or N.W. and S.E., with the exception of Miu- 1 The true boundai~y between the Ma- laysian and Melanesian or Indo-Australian groups appeals to lie between Bali and Lombok, in which case the Lesser Sunda islands should be transferred to the latter , division. x 2"], [476, "INDIAN ARCHIPELAGO. 460 Book II. danao, the most southerly of the group, which has its greatest extension E. and W. The Sooloo Islands form an intermediate link between this group and Borneo. All the islands are mountainous. The respective areas and populations of the more important divisions of the Archipelago are as follow : \u2014 Climate and Productions. \u2014 In respect to climate, the Eastern Archi pelago is subject to the general conditions of a tropical region. The equator nearly bisects the group, crossing Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes, and Gilolo, The extreme heat to which these islands are exposed from their position relatively to the sun, is tempered by the sea-breezes that reach them from all sides. In Sumatra the mean annual tem perature at Bencoolen is about 82-J0 : in Java on the N. coast 78\u00b0, and on the elevated plains of the interior 67\u00b0: in the Philippines 81\u00b0 in summer, and 71\u00b0 in winter. The rainy season varies in the different islands and in different parts of the larger ones, according as they are exposed to the S.E. or the N.E. monsoon : in Java, for instance, it falls between October and March: in Borneo on the S.W. coast, between April and September, but on the E. coast between September and April ; and similarly with regard to the W. and E. coasts of the Philip pines. The prolific vegetation produced by the joint agencies of heat aud moisture render all low swampy regions unhealthy, but with this exception the islands generally, and more particularly the elevated regions, bear a good character for salubrity. The productions ofthe Indian Archipelago are very varied. Spices may be regarded as the characteristic product of the whole group : the Moluccas are particu larly celebrated for the clove and the nutmeg : Sumatra and Java for pepper, ginger, and cubebs : the Philippines for tobacco : and most of the islands yield valuable dyes and gums, indigo, turmeric, benzoin, &c. In regard to bread plants, the eastern islands are distinguished from the others by the adoption of sago as the staple of life, while the Greater Sundas and the Philippines depend mainly on rice, but also produce maize and millet. In regard to minerals, Banca, a dependency of Su matra, is famous for its tin : a certain amount of gold is found in Borneo and Sumatra: coal in Luzon and in the British island of Labuan off the coast of Borneo : antimony and diamonds in Borneo. The wild animals are in many cases peculiar to this region : we may specify the ourang-outang of Borneo and Sumatra ; the babiroussa or hog-deer ; the kalong or fruit-eating bat of the Sunda isles ; flying squirrels of various kinds, and seme species of flying lemurs ; the Malaysian tapir ; and the auoa, a fierce kind of antelope, about the size of a sheep, found in Celebes. We may mention certain peculiar productions on which the Asiatics set a high value \u2014 such as edible birds' -nests, the sea-slug or beche-de-mer, sharks' fins, and the betel-nut. Name.

EUROPEAN SETTLEMENTS. 461 Inhabitants. \u2014 The constituent element of the population in the Indian Archipelago is the Malay, as implied in the term \" Malaysia.\" The characteristics of this race are an olive complexion, long straight hair, short stature, active restless habits, violent passions, and a moderate capacity for civilization. In the Eastern isles the Papuan is found, either mingled with the Malay, or in exclusive possession of the smaller isles. He resembles the negro in hue and hair, and is in a very low state of civilization. Many of the islands have their special aboriginal peoples, such as the Dyaks of Borneo ; the Bugis of Celebes, a remark ably enterprising aud intelligent race, who carry on a great part of the trade of the Archipelago ; and the Horaforas of the interior of Celebes and the Philippines. Chinese are dispersed in great numbers over the Archipelago, as shopkeepers, artisans, and sailors. Some of the native sovereigns have extensive territories and considerable power : among these the Sultan of Bruni in Borneo holds the first place. Generally speaking, however, the states are too small, and the degree of civiliza tion too low for extended influence. The seas are much infested with pirates, who find ready shelter for themselves and their \"prahus\" in the numberless creeks and rivers on the shores. European Settlements. \u2014 A large number of European settlements have been formed in the Indian Archipelago for commercial purposes. The Dutch hold the first place both in the number and the lengthened tenure of their posts: in short, they possess no inconsiderable \" empire'' in these regions, the chief seat of which is Java with Batavia for its capital. The extent of their territories and of their influence fluctuates extremely in the different islands : in Java itself they possess about three fourths of the island, the southern coast being still in the hands of native princes : in Sumatra they hold the western coast as far N. as 2\u00b0 N. lat., and the eastern as far north a3 1\u00b0 30' S. lat., with Bencoolen, Lampong, and Palembang for their chief stations : in Borneo, the S.W. coast with Sambas, Banjermassin, and Pontianak for their stations : in Celebes, the greater part of the island with Menado and Kema in the N. peninsula, and Macassar or Mankasser in the S.W. peninsula : while in the Moluccas they have stations on most of the islands, including Amboyna, Banda, and Ternate. They also own the whole of Banca, Billiton, and Madura in the Greater Sunda Isles, and in the Lesser have stations at Coopang on the S. coast of Timor, and at Badong in Bali. The total number of Europeans in these eastern possessions in 1864, was 33,677, of whom 27,105 were in Java and Madura. Of the other European powers Spain holds the Philippines with Manilla for their capital : the English have a colony on Labuan, a small island off the N.W. coast of Borneo, with valuable deposits of coal ; and the Portuguese have three settlements on the N. coast of Timor, and own the isle of Kambing to the N. of Timor. Of the towns we may men tion Batavia, on the N. coast of Java, a thoroughly Dutch-looking town, with canals, rows of trees, gardens, &c. : it has been rendered much more healthy of late by careful drainage : the harbour is large and well pro tected ; Samarang and Soerabaya, seaport towns and provincial capitals of the Dutch on the N. coast of Java: Manilla, in Luzon, a fortified town with an arsenal and stone buildings, and a large suburb devoted to commerce, and chiefly constructed of bamboo ; Sarawak, or \" Kuck ing,\" as the natives call it, on the river Sarawak, 17 m. from the W. coast of Borneo, well known in connexion with the late Sir J.

Ras-el-Krun, 37\u00b0 20' N. lat.; S., Cape Agulhas, 34\u00b0 50' S. lat. ; W., Cape Verd, 17\u00b0 30\" W. long. ; and E., Cape Guardafui, 51\u00b0 22' E. long. Its extreme length, from N. to S. is estimated at 5000 m. ; its extreme breadth at 4700 m. ; its area (the adjacent islands included) at 11,556,300 sq. m. ; and its population (for which the data are very uncertain) at 188,000,000. History of Discovery. \u2014 The discovery of Africa may be conveniently treated under the two heads of (1) the coasts ; (2) the interior. 1. The exploration of the coasts is chiefly due to tbe Portuguese, stimulated by information derived from the Moors. At the commencement of the 15th century, navigation did not extend beyond Cape Nun. In 1415 Cape Bojador was reached, and in 1433 it was doubled, attempts having been previously made to effeot this, in one of which the Canaries and Madeira islands were discovered in 1418. In 144-1 C. Blanco was reached ; in 1443, Arguin ; in 1446, the Senegal river and Cape Verd ; in 1448, the Azores : in 1449, the Cape Verd islands ; in 1463, Sierra Leone; in 1469, the coast of Guinea; in 1484, the river Congo or Zaire; and in 1486, the Cape of Good Hope. The E. coast was explored by Vasco de Gama, in 1497-1499 from Natal to Magadoxo in 2\u00b0 5' N. lat. : the remainder was previously known from the accounts of the Arabs. 2. The discovery of the interior has been chiefly prose cuted by English explorers, many of whom have fallen martyrs to their heroic zeal in the cause. The Niger was the earliest object of investiga tion. Futile attempts to reach it were made by the English in 1620 and 1723 from the side of the Gambia, and by the French in 1697 by the course of the Senegal. In 1795-6, Mungo Park succeeded in tracing its course from Bammakoo to Silla, and in 1&05-6, from Bammakoo to Boussa, where he was murdered and his journals lost. In 1826 Clap perton reached the Niger at Boussa, from Badagry on the coast of Guinea ; and in 1830 the lower course ofthe river was explored by the Landers, who reaching it at the same point as Clapperton traced its course up to Yaouri and down to the sea. Major Laing had meanwhile explored its upper course in 1822, and in 1826 had crossed the Sahara from Tripoli to Timbuctoo. We have further to notice the Niger expeditions of 1832, 1841, and 1857, the results of which were not commensurate with the expense and loss of life which accompanied them ; and, lastly, the more effective journeys (1849-55) of Barth, Overweg, and Vogel in the regions of the Sahara hetween Tripoli and Lake Tchad, and S. of Tchad to the upper course of the Benuwe branch of the Niger. The sources of the Mle have furnished a yet more interesting and difficult problem which can hardly yet be said to be fully settled. Bruce's discoveries in 1770 were limited to the lesser arm or Blue Nile, which he traced up by the Abai branch to its sources in Abyssinia. The White Nile was traced up by Linant in 1827 to El-Ais in 13\u00b0 43' N. lat.; by Mohammed Ali's expedition in 1840 to 6\u00b0 30' N. lat. ; by Knoblecherin 1850 to 4\u00b0 9' N. lat., and by Brun Rollet in 1851 to Garbo in 3\u00b0 N. lat. Explorations have been also carried on from the E. coast of Africa ; these have resulted in the discovery in 1848 of the snow capped mountain Iiilimandjaro by Rebmann, and the great discovery of"], [480, "464 AFRICA. Book III. the Victoria Nyanza by Speke in 1862. This has been supplemented by Baker's discovery in 1864 of the second great reservoir, the Albert Nyanza, whicb he reached by the course of the Nile. Turning to Southern Africa, we find that at the beginning of the present century nothing was known of the interior to the N. of the Sneeuw-Bergen. In 1801, Trutter and Somerville penetrated across the Orange River to Lattakoo in the Bechuana country. No great progress, however, was made in this direction until the famous expeditions of Livingstone, who in 1849 reached Lake Ngami and the Zouga, and in 1852-6 achieved his grand discovery of the river Zambesi, by the course of which he completely crossed the continent from Loanda to Quillimane. \u00a7 2. General Characteristics. \u2014 Africa is chiefly distinguished by its isolation and inaccessibility. The circumstances that conduce to these features are : \u2014 (1) The scarcity of islands in the sur rounding seas, the Mediterranean excepted. (2) The regularity of its coast-line. (3) The paucity of navigable rivers and the unhealthiness of the climate about the embouchures of such as are found within the Tropics. (4) The presence of broad belts of desert, frequently interposed between the coast and the interior. (5) The position of the mountain chains, running for the most part parallel to the coast. (6) The solidity of the mass of land and particularly of the northern division. (7) The extreme heat and aridity of the interior. \u00a7 3. Seas and Coast-line. \u2014 The inclosed or semi-inclosed seas about Africa are few. The Mediterranean has been already described in general terms (cap 1, \u00a7 3) : the noticeable features, as far as Africa is concerned, are (1) the regularity of the coast-line, the only important break being the southerly intrusion between the highlands of Barca and Atlas, with the Gulfs of Sidra and Cabes at its E. and W. extremities ; and (2) the approximation of the continent at C. Bon to the isle of Sicily. On the side of the Atlantic, the only prominent feature is the Gulf of Guinea with the two Bights of Benin and Biafra. On the E. we may notice the Mozambique Channel, between Madagascar and the mainland ; and the Gulf of Aden, which leads up to the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. Capes. \u2014 The most prominent headlands are : \u2014 On the N. coast, C. Bon, opposite Sicily ; C. Ceuta, opposite Gibraltar ; and C. Spartel, at the outer entrance of the Strait of Gibraltar. On the W. coast, C. Ghir, the termination of the Atlas range ; C. Nun, in 28\u00b0 45' N. lat., tlie terror of the early Portuguese mariuers ; C Bojador, in 26\u00b0 7' N. lat. ; C. Blanco, in 20\u00b0 40' N. lat., conspicuous by its 3 ivliite sandy peaks ; C. Verd, the most westerly point of the continent, green with its forest of baobab trees; C. Palmas, at the commencement of the Gulf of Guinea ; C. Lopez, just S. of the equator ; the C. of Good Hope, near the S. extremity of the W. coast, so named by John III. of Portugal in exchange for the title of Cabo Tormentoso \" Stormy Cape \" given to it by its discoverer Bartolomeo Diazinl4S6 ; C. Agulhas, ( = \" the needles\"), at the extreme S. ; C, Corrientes, on the E. coast in 24\u00b0 T S. lat., so"], [481, "Chap. XXI.

Guardafui at the extreme E. angle of the continent. EJOEX. VV. Victoria Nyanza. A. Albert Nyanza. \u00a7 4. Configuration, Mountains and Plains. \u2014 Africa is wholly devoid of those distinctive features which characterize the continents already described : it has neither the dorsal mountain-chains of Europe, nor the central plateau-masses of Asia. It might perhaps be metaphorically described as an \" invertebrate \" continent, consisting of a huge shapeless body without any internal framework, \u2014 a region of vast expanses, sometimes low and open to the sea, elsewhere elevated between bounding ranges, or rising gradually by a series of terraces from the sea-level. Speaking generally, the interior plains of the northern division are low, and of the southern division high, with the peculiarity, however, that the central region of the southern. division dips or falls away from the bounding ranges, like the trough of the sea between the crests of two -waves. The mountains exhibit a large amount of parallelism both in reference to the coast and in their own formation : this may be noticed in the Atlas x 3"], [482, "466 AFRICA. Book III. ranges of the N., which are parallel to the Mediterranean and to each other ; in the Kong Mountains of the W., which run parallel to the coast of Guinea ; in the bounding ranges of the southern division, which skirt the coast, like the Ghauts of Hindostan ; and in the terrace-ranges in which these terminate in the extreme S. Mountain-knots or rugged plateaus of great ele vation are rare : Abyssinia is the most remarkable instance of a compact well-defined region of this kind. Mountains. \u2014 The most extensive and connected range in Africa is Atlas, extending from Cape Ghir on the shores of the Atlantic, to C. Bon on the Mediterranean ; it is composed of several parallel ranges, some of which contain heights of 1 0,000 ft., while one summit named Mil tsin fil, 400 ft.) is rarely free from snow. In 4\u00b0 30' W. long. a considerable break occurs in the line and a series of northern offsets ramify thence towards the Mediterranean. The whole system is divided into three zones, distinguished as the Great, Middle, and Little Atlas, the Great Atlas comprising the most southerly and loftiest . ranges, between Capes Ghir and Bon ; the Middle Atlas the less lofty ranges between the Gulf of Tunis and the Strait of Gibraltar ; and the Little Atlas the coast range of Algeria between the rivers Bougiah and Shells. The mountains of Abyssinia rise out of a lofty plateau and appear to be irregular heights rather than extensive ranges : they frequently attain an elevation above the sea-level of from 11,000 to 13,500 ft., the culminat ing point Abba Tared reaching 15,000 ft. More to the S. between 1\u00b0 and 3\u00b0 S. lat. are the snow-clad peaks of Xenia and Kilimandjaro, estimated at 20,000 ft. above the sea, and belonging to a range running N. and S. Of the rauges that skirt the E. coast we know little until we reach Natal, where the Drakenberg and Quathlamba mountains form a continuous range of great importance: between 31\u00b0 and 32\u00b0 S. lat. this range turns W.-ward, and under various designations crosses the con tinent, while more to the S. are other parallel ranges, supporting the terraces which descend to the coast. The W. coast presents no feature of importance until we reach the inmost angle of the Gulf of Guinea, where is the apparently isolated range of the Camaroons, one of the peaks, mount Albert, attaining a height of 13,000 ft. The mountains of W. Central Africa are imperfectly known : the highland terminates in Mindifi Mt, between 8000 and 10,000 ft., situated in 10\u00b0 40' N. lat., 14\u00b0 25' E. long. Western Guinea is separated from the interior by the Kong range, said to attain to the limit of perpetual snow. \u00a7 5. Hydrogkapht \u2014 Eivers and Lakes. \u2014 From the peculiar formation of Africa it is impossible to apportion out the whole of the continent into slopes and ocean-basins. Well-defined watersheds are rare : in the North, vast regions of neutral ground intervene between the chief river-basins : in the South, on the other hand, the rivers overlap and inosculate with one another on the interior plains. The several hydrographical regions must be regarded independently, and the points most worthy of notice are the following : \u2014 (1) The immense length of the basin of the Nile, coupled with the general contraction of its breadth. (2) The very reverse conditions in the basin of the Niger \u2014 wide-spreading expansion with comparatively"], [483, "Chap. XXI. HYDROGRAPHY. 467 slight length. (3) The approximation of these two basins about the 10th parallel, and the possible existence of a nearly continuous water-way across the continent by means of their branches, com bined with the internal river-system connected with Lake Tchad. (4) The effect of the parallelism of the mountain-chains in produc ing falls and rapids as the rivers burst through them to the lower levels. (5) The labyrinthine maze of waters in the interior plains of South Africa, as illustrated in the neighbourhood of Lake Ngami and the mid Zambesi. Rivers.\u2014 The Nile is oomposed of two main branches distinguished as the White and the Blue Niles, which unite at Khartoum in 15\u00b0 30' N. lat. The Blue Nile or shorter branch rises in Abyssinia, and is also composed of two main streams, of which the Abai, issuing from Lake Dembea, is generally reputed the chief, though it seems doubtful whe ther the Dedhesa is not really such. The White Nile has been traced up to two great reservoirs lying under the Equator, the Victoria Ny anza or upper one (3308 ft. above the sea), and the Albert Nyanza (2720 ft.), which lies more W. Between these lakes the river (here designated the Somerset) descends rapidly by a series of falls, one of which (the Murchison falls; has a sheer descent of 120 ft. It enters the Albert Nyanza near its N. extremity in 2\u00b0 16' N. lat. Issuing from the lake it descends rapidly to Gondokoro in 4\u00b0 54' N. lat., receiving in 3\u00b0 45' N. lat. the Asna on its rt. bank : at Gondokoro it becomes navigable for river steamers. Below this it trends to the W. until it receives 1. the Bahr-el-Gazal, which joins it with a broad slug gish stream : then it turns sharp E. to the confluence of the Sobat in go gl' N. lat., which joins it with a clear stream about 120 yds. broad, and then it resumes its northerly course to Khartoum. Below the Blue Nile it is joined in 17\u00b0 37' N. lat. by the Atbara, which, with its tribu tary the Settite or Tacazze, receives the drainage of central Abyssinia: in the spring the bed of the Atbara is a mere sandy waste, but in the rainy Beason it is a raging torrent 450 yds. wide and 30 ft. deep. The Nile receives no further affluent during its remaining course of 1100 m. ; and as in this long stretch it is liable to waste from evapora tion and percolation, its volume must attain its maximum just below the Atbara. The course of the river in Nubia and Egypt will be more particularly described in connexion with those countries. Next to the Nile in importance comes the Niger, Joliba, or Quorra, which would have been yet more important if its length had been directed in a straight line, as the Nile, instead of the circuitous route it actually assumes. It rises on the northern or inner slope of the Kong Mts. at an elevation of 1600 ft., and drains the whole angle between these mountains and the northerly offsets on the side of Senegambia : it flows N.E. to Timbuctoo in 17\u00b0 40' N. lat., then nearly due E. to the meridian of Greenwich, then S.E. to the confluence of the Benuwe, and S. to the Gulf of Guinea, which it enters by several mouths, forming a vast Delta : of its mouths the Nun is the most frequented by shipping. The Benuwe, which joins it in 7\u00b0 44', is in some respects a more va luable water-way than the Niger itself, inasmuch as it opens up a route into the heart of Africa in the direction of Lake Tchad. Both rivers are navigable for steamers. An important group of river3 is found pouring down their waters to the Atlantic on the other side of the"], [484, "468 AFRICA. Book III. watershed which bounds tbe Upper Niger, such as the Senegal, the Gambia, the Rio Grande, and the Eokelle or Sierra Leone. The Senegal, which is by far the largest, has its entrance sealed against ships of burthen by a bar: cataracts are frequent in its upper course. The Gambia and Rio Grande are more accessible. In the Southern Division of Africa, the first large river on the western coast S. of the Gulf of Guinea is the Ogobai, which drains a large district on each side of the Equator through its two branches, the Apangi and the Akandu, and discharges its waters through several channels, such as the Nazareth and Mexias, which were formerly re garded as independent rivers. The Congo or Zaire, which reaches the Atlantic in about 0\u00b0 S. lat., is a stream of large volume, but of almost unknown course : it is supposed to come from the S.E., some of its feeders having been discovered on the central plateau in 11\u00b0 S. lat. : the navigation is impeded by cataracts about 150 m. from the sea. The Great Orange or Gariep is an important river of Southern Africa, com posed of two branches, the Orange and the Gariep or Vaal, which rise in the eastern ranges and unite in 24\u00b0 30' E. long. ; thence the river flows W. with numerous falls to the Atlantic in 28\u00b0 30' S. lat. : its mouth is closed by a bar. On the side of the Indian Ocean the most important river is the Zambesi, which forms the outlet for the drainage of a vast area in the interior. The head-waters of the main stream are as yet unex plored, but one of the branches of it3 tributary, the Leeba, has been traced to its source in lake Dilolo (11\u00b0 15' S. lat., 22\u00b0 30' E. long.). The Leeba joins the main stream, flowing from the N., in 23\u00b0 30' E. long.: thence the general course of the river is S.E., and it receives nu merous affluents, of which we may notice the Chobe, in 23\u00b0 50' E. long., the Kafue, and the Shire, which joins it in its lower course. The approach to the river is impeded by a most dangerous bar, and the interior navi gation by the Victoria falls, of which an illustration is given at the head of this chapter, and which occur in 26\u00b0 6' E. long. Lakes. \u2014 Most ofthe large African lakes are connected with the Oceanic basins by the rivers : as the Victoria and Albert Nyanzas, already no ticed in connexion with the White Nile ; Dembea or Tzana, in Abyssinia (6120 ft. above the sea), the reservoir of the Abai branch ofthe Blue Nile ; Lake Nyassa (1300 ft.), which discharges its surplus waters through the Shir^ into the Zambesi ; and probably Lake Ngami (2385 ft.), which appears to be connected with the Zambesi and possibly with the Limpopo. The chief exceptions are: \u2014 (1) Lake Tchad (850 ft. above the sea), the receptacle of the drainage of a region between the Niger and Nile basins, its chief feeders being the Waube or Yeou from the W. and the Shary from the S., and its circumference varying according to the season of the year from 200 to 400 m. (2) Lake Tanganyika1 (1844 ft.), an elongated sheet lying S. of the Nile basin and N. of the Kafue branch of the Zambesi. And (3; Lake Assal, noticeable for its great depression (570 ft.) below the sea-level : it is situated near the E. coast in 11\u00b0 37' N. lat. \u00a7 6.

XXI. CLIMATE \u2014 VEGETATION. 469 or even 4-5ths of the whole, lies within the tropics. Under any circumstances, therefore, a very high temperature might be expected to prevail in this continent. But its physical conformation favours and intensifies this tendency : the vast expanse of unbroken land in the northern division, the slight elevation of the surface, and the aridity of the Sahara, all tend to make Africa the hottest region in the world : it is pre-eminently the \" tropical \" continent. The extreme of heat is found, not under the equator itself, but in the neighbour hood of the northern tropic \u2014 in the Nubian Desert, where food will cook by being buried in the sand ; on the coast of the Red Sea, the mean temperature of Massowah being 88\u00b0; and at Mourzouk in Fezzan, where the summer heat reaches 130\u00b0 in the shade. In the desert regions the range of the thermometer is very great, and the nights are comparatively as cold as the days are hot, the radia tion of heat from the earth's surface being very rapid in consequence of the absence of cloud. Taken as a whole, Africa may be divided into 5 zones as follows : \u2014 (1) A central zone of tropical rains. (2) A rainless zone of great extent to the N. of the central one. (3) A similar rainless zone, but of restricted area (the Kalahari Desert) to the S. of the central one. (4) A sub-tropical zone N. of the Atlas range, with a climate resembling that of Southern Europe, but some what hotter, the mean at Algiers being 66\u00b0\"50, and the rainfall 32 inches. (5) A sub-tropical, but rather arid zone in the extreme S., the mean temperature at Cape Town being 64\u00b0-7, and the rain fall 24 inches. Some parts of Africa are subject to hot and pesti lential winds, such as the khamsin of Egypt, the simoom or samiel of the Sahara, and the harmattan of the Guinea coast. The central parts of Africa are unsuited to European constitutions, particularly the coasts and the embouchures of the rivers, which are fringed with jungle and carry down in their waters a large amount of putrescent vegetable matter. Southern Africa is healthy, and the borders of the Kalahari desert would form an admirable sanatorium for con sumptive patients. In the north, Algeria is already becoming a place of resort for invalids during the winter. \u00a7 7. Vegetation. \u2014 The flora of Northern Africa, or rather of the Atlas region, resembles generally that of Southern Europe, but with a considerable admixture of tropical plants : the most noticeable pro ductions here are the various species of cistus, and the close-grained sandarach wood. The soil and climate of this region are admirably adapted to the growth of cereals. On the southern side of Atlas the date-palm is the chief bread-plant : it also prevails in Egypt. The Sahara itself yields little beyond a rough grass which supplies forage to camels : the oases, however, are fertile in palms. On the western coast within the tropics the huge baobab (Adansonia) is the most remarkable feature, covering large areas with its wide-spreading"], [486, "Book III, 470 AFRICA, foliage. Mangroves fringe the rivers, and various kinds of palm trees are found there, one of which yields the oil so largely used in England for greasing the wheels of railway carriages. To the same region belong the butter-tree, the cream-fruit, the custard apple, and other trees of the Sapota order. In the S. the characteristic plants belong to the heath and proteacean orders : aloes, euphorbias, prickly acacias, and various species of mesembryanthemums, are also com mon. The vine ripens in Cape Colony, and cereals are successliilly cultivated in these parts. About the Zambesi, the dhourra (holcus sorghum) and maize are cultivated, together with various fruiis and vegetables, such as melons, beans, yams, the arum, the sweet potato, and the manioc whence tapioca is produced. Coffee grows wild in Abyssinia, and is successfully cultivated in Angola. Indigo and cotton are found in various parts either in a wild state or cultivated. \u00a7 8. Zoology. \u2014 Africa is more noted for its wild than for its domes ticated animals. The merino sheep is, indeed, a native of the Atlas region, and various kinds of oxen are used as beasts of burthen, some of which are noticeable for the im mense size and length ot' their horns. The camel is invaluable as a beast of burthen across the deserts. The elephant, though com mon, is not domesti cated, but still has a commercial value from its tusks, which are one ofthe chief articles of barter throughout the whole of the con tinent. The feathers of the ostrich, which frequents the southern Hippopotj mus cariying her yonnj plains, are also valuable. Setting these aside, the fauna of Africa is rather a matter of interest to the naturalist than a source of wealth to the inhabitants. Many well-known species are peculiar to this division of the world, as the giraffe, the zebra and quagga, the hip popotamus, the gorilla, and the chimpanzee. Antelopes are exceed ingly numerous on the plains of Southern Africa, and many species are unknown in other parts of the world. Among the more re-"], [487, "Chap. XXI. INHABITANTS. 471 markable of these we may notice the springbok, which visits the karroos in such vast numbers ; the blessbok or boutebok, beautifully marked ; the koodoo, which somewhat resembles an ox ; the gnu, a very shy animal ; tbe hartebeest, and the eland or canna, both of which furnish excellent meat. Lions, hy\u00e6nas, panthers, jackals, and foxes prevail everywhere, and crocodiles are numerous in the rivers. The bite of a small fly, called the Tsetse, which infests the Zambesi, proves fatal to domesticated, though not to wild, animals. We may further notice the aye-aye, a very rare animal, peculiar to Madagascar, and so named from its cry ; and the now extinct dodo, a bird about the size of a swan, which was very common in Mauritius, Bourbon, and Rodriguez, when these islands were first discovered. Africa has contributed the guinea-fowl to our farmyard stock. \u00a7 9. Mineralogy. \u2014 Little is as yet known ofthe mineral resources of Africa. Iron and copper appear to be very generally diffused ; but coal is deficient, though not altogether absent, a large field having been discovered at Zumbo on the Zambesi. Gold dust is found in the rivers of the central region and on the Guinea and Mozambique coasts, particularly about Tete, and furnishes an article of commerce. Silver appears to be restricted to Marocco and Abyssinia. Salt and natron are obtained from the lakes of the desert region. \u00a7 10. Ethnography. \u2014 The great bulk of the African population, to the extent of 3-4ths of the whole, belongs to the negro stock. They occupy the central regions throughout the whole breadth of the continent. The subdivisions into nations and tribes, with distinct languages, appearance, and institutions, are so numerous as to defy description. All are in a low state of civilization, and suffer terribly from tribal wars and from the effects of the slave trade. The inhabit ants of North Africa are of Caucasian descent, such as the Berbers of Marocco, the Kabyles of Algeria, the Tuaricks of the northern Sahara, and the Copts of Egypt. Tho languages spoken by these peoples are classed as sub-Shemitic. The Abyssinians and Gallas belong yet more decidedly to the Caucasian stock : their tongues, particularly the Gheez and Tigre of Abyssinia, are Shemitic. In South Africa two races very distinct in every respect are found side by side, viz., the Caffre and the Hottentot, the latter of stunted growth, low intellect, and using a very peculiar language ; the former a well-grown and spirited people. Lastly, we have to notice the immigrant races \u2014 the Arabs, who are ubiquitous as merchants and settlers on the E. coast and throughout the northern regions as far S. as lake Tchad ; the Jews, who are numerous in Abyssinia and Marocco; the Turks, in the towns of the N. coast; the French, in Algeria ; the Dutch, of Cape Colony ; and the British, of the South African colonies."], [488, "EGYPT. Book III. 472 \u00a7 11. Political Divisions. \u2014 The political organization of the native African communities is so rude and unstable, that it is im possible to assign distinct limits to states and countries, or to give an exhaustive list of the divisions of the continent. A few states have a more or less defined territory, as Egypt and Marocco ; but, for the most part, the\" divisions are territorial rather than political, and have been adopted by Europeans for convenience rather than from any real authority for their use. These remarks do not, of course, apply to the French territory of Algeria, or to the British colonies in South Africa, the limits of which are sufficiently defined. Of the generally received divisions the following are the most important : (1) The Egyptian territory \u2014 Egypt, Nubia, and Kordofan. (2) Abyssinia. (3) The Turkish provinces of the N. coast \u2014 Tripoli, Tunis, and Barca. (4) The French province of Algeria. (5) The Empire of Marocco. (6) Senegambia, or the west central coast. (7) Upper Guinea. (8) Soudan or Nigritia. (9.) Lower Guinea. (10) British Africa. II. Egypt, Nubia, and Kordofan. \u00a7 12. Egypt \u2014 Boundaries, Area, and Population. Natural features. Cltmate and Productions. \u2014 Egypt is the title both of a sovereignty and of a territory. The sovereignty is one of wide extent, and includes, besides Egypt itself, Nubia, Kordofan, Takale, the adjacent portions of Soudan, and various territories between Nubia and Abyssinia, such as Taka and Barea. The extreme S. point of this sovereignty on the White Nile is placed at Helle e-Deleb, and on the Blue Nile at Fazoklo: its total area may be about 660,000 sq. m., and its population 7,465,000. Egypt itself forms the northern division of this empire, and is bounded N. by the Mediterranean Sea, E. by the Bed Sea, the Gulf of Suez, and a line crossing the isthmus between Suez and Wady-el-Arish, S. by a line coinciding with the twenty-fourth parallel, and W. by the Libyan Desert. Its geographical position, commanding (as it does) the isthmus between the Mediterranean and Red Seas, gives it an abnormal importance in connection with the overland route between Europe and Eastern Asia. The length of the country from N. to S. is about 520 m. ; its area and population are very diversely esti mated ; the area may be about 170,000 or 180,000 sq. m. ; and the population, 4,306,691. Natural Features. \u2014 The leading feature in the physical geography of this country is the Nile, whioh threads its way to the sea along a narrow depression or cleft in the great desert plain, producing a thin strip of verdure which contrasts most remarkably with the surround ing barrenness. Viewed from the N. the Nile basin assumes the form of a funnel, the Delta gradually contracting into a narrow channel."], [489, "Chap. XXI. THE NILE. 473 The length of the base-line of the Delta along tha Mediterranean is about 120 m., and the distance from this to the apex about 90 m. Formerly the river had 7 considerable channels ; now it has only two of any size, viz., the Rosetta or Western mouth (1800 ft. wide) and the Damietta or Eastern mouth (800 ft.). Extensive lagoons skirt the coast, connected by canals with one or other of the branches, and having outlets to the sea : the largest of these are Menzaleh, E. of the Damietta mouth ; Bourlos, E. of the Rosetta mouth ; Etko, having its outlet by the old Canopic mouth ; and Mariout (the ancient Mareostis). The heights which shut in the Nile valley and which have all the appearance of mountain ranges from the valley itself, though in reality they are merely the sides of the depression, are distinguished as the Libyan Mts. on the W., and the Arabian Mts. on the E. The river approaches nearer to the eastern than the western range, the latter Cairo being seldom less than 10 m., and occasionally 15 m. distant. A break occurs in the western range in 29\u00b0 10' N. lat., giving access to the basin of Faioum in which lies the lake named Birket-el-Keroun. This lake is connected with the Nile by the eanal called the Bahr Joussouf (\"Joseph's Canal\"), whicb traverses the western side of the valley for about 150 m., running parallel to the Nile itself. In its course tbrough Egypt the Nile flows at the rate of about 3 m. an hour, with a fall of 5 inches to the m., the distance from Assouan to Rosetta being by the river 732 m., and the difference of elevation 300 ft. It is subject to a periodical flood, which commences in July, attains its maximum towards the end of September, and then gradually subsides. The rise varies from 20 to 30 ft. The first cataract or rapid occurs near Assouan on the S. frontier of Egypt. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The chief feature in the climate of Egypt is its general dryness ; rain is almost unknown in Upper Egypt, aud"], [490, "EGYPT. Book III. 474 seldom falls at Cairo, but is common in the Delta between November and March. The winters are delightfully mild and suited to the European constitution. The summer heat is excessive by day, and the nights are comparatively cold. At Cairo the mean temperature of the year is 72\u00b0 2', of winter 58\u00b0 4', and of summer 85\u00b0 1'. The most disagreeable season is during the prevalence of the Khamsin, a pesti lential wind from the S.S.W., which blows at intervals during 50 days (whence the name, meaning \" fifty \"j in April and May. The soil of the Valley of the Nile is a rich alluvium deposited through a long succession of ages by the annual inundations. The Delta is inferior to Upper Egypt in respect to the quality of its soil. Large quantities of grain are produced in the latter district together with u certain amount of flax, cotton, sugar-cane, and indigo. In the Delta less grain is pro duced, but rice is grown, along with cotton, flax, simsim, &c. The date palm thrives as far N. as Thebes. The river and lakes teem with fish, which contribute much to the sustenance of the people. Wild fowl is also abundant, but is not turned to much account by the natives. \u00a7 13. Inhabitants, Political Divisions, Towns, &c. \u2014 The modern Egyptians are mainly of Arab descent, but with an ad- mixture of the old Egyptian or Coptic stock, which has been gradu- ally absorbed by the dominant element and is now reduced to about 150,000 souls. The bulk of the Egyptians lead a settled life, and are engaged in agriculture : the labourers are termed Fellahs or Fellaheen ; they are a frugal, lively, and intelligent people ; indolent and sensual ; ground down by taxation and the oppressive rule of their masters. The other elements of the population are Turks, who form the ruling class ; Bedouin or wandering Arabs ; Jews, Gipseys, Negroes, and a sprinkling of Europeans, who are chiefly settled at Alexandria. The country is divided, as of old, into its 3 natural regions \u2014 Bahiri or Lower Egypt ; Vostani or Middle Egypt ; and Sa'id or Upper Egypt ; and these are subdivided into 11 administra- tive provinces, of which there are 5 in Lower Egypt, with an aggre- gate population of 2,357,254 ; 3 in Middle Egypt, with a population of 780,442 ; and 3 in Upper Egypt, with a population of 1,168,995. There are only 5 towns with populations exceeding 10,000, viz. : Cairo (256,700), the capital, situated at the head of the Delta near the rt. bank of the Nile, a thoroughly Oriental town with narrow winding streets ; Alexandria (164,400), the great commercial and naval port of Egypt, on the W. border of the Delta, partly built in the European style with open and regular streets ; Damietta (37,100), on the eastern arm of the Nile about 8 m. above its mouth, once a famous commercial and manufacturing town (dimity is so named from it), now chiefly dependent on its rice-fields and fisheries ; Rosetta (18,300), on the western arm of the Nile, a well-built and once fashionable town, now carrying on a few manufactures ; and Tanta (19,500), in the centre of the Delta on the line of railway, famed for its great religious fetes. Suez is a poor town at the head of the gulf of the same name. Siout ranks as the capital of Upper Egypt."], [491, "475 Chap. XXI. GOVERNMENT, ETC. Government, Religion, Commerce, and Communications. \u2014 Egypt is nominally an appanage of the Porte, and still pays an annual tribute. Practically, however, the Viceroy is an independent monarch : the office is hereditary in the direct line of succession, and the Viceroy has his own army and navy. The government is a despotism ; but Euro pean institutions have been so far introduced that there is a Council of State and a Ministry. The Egyptians are Mohammedans, with the exception of the Copts who form an independent Christian Church holding Monophysite tenets. Primary education is general, but the standard is very low. A large transit traffic goes on between Suez and Alexandria ; a railway, passing through Cairo, connects these ports : it crosses the Rosetta branch of the Nile to the W. of Tanta, and the Damietta branch near Benha : its total length is about 210m. A ship canal is in course of formation, to connect the Gulf of Suez with the Mediterranean at Port Said : when completed, it will have a length of 96 m., a breadth of 328 ft., aud a depth of 26 ft. A fresh-water canal runs nearly parallel to it for 50 m. between Suez and Ismailia. The shadoof. The harbour at Port Said is formed by two jetties, the eastern one projecting 2515 yds., and the western 3609 yds. At Suez the equi noctial spring tide rises ordinarily 3-67 ft. above the mean level of the Red Sea. and occasionally, under a S. gale, to 538 ft. The rise at Port Said never exceeds 1-83 tt. The commerce with the interior is carried on by the Nile to the S., and by caravans to the W. The chief exports to Europe are raw cotton aud grain, which Great Britain takes in ex change for cotton goods, machinery, &c. Great attention is now paid to agriculture ; but the processes are generally antiquated. Irrigation is commonly effected bv means of the shadoof, of whicb we give an illustration. When (he bank is nigh, two or more shadoofs are required to raise the water to the required level. Noteworthy Objects\u2014 Egvpt abounds with interesting remains of anti quity. We can do little \"more than mention the most famous, such"], [492, "Book III, 476 EGYPT. as at Alexandria the so-called Pompey's Pillar, erected by Publius in honour of Diocletian, and the so-called Cleopatra's Needles, being two obelisks, one erect, the other fallen, brought from Heliopolis by one of the Roman emperors ; the Pyramids at Geezeh near Cairo, and the gigantic head of the Sphinx ; the vestiges of the dams that formed the ancient lake or reservoir of M\u00e6ris and the substructures ofthe Laby rinth, near Medinet-el-Faioum ; the magnificent ruins of ancient Thebes at Karnak and Luxor on the right bank of the Nile, and at Gurnah and Medinet Aboo on the left bank ; the portico of the temple of Athor at Denderah, with the so-called Zodiac; the colossal temples at Edfoo built the one by Ptolemy Philometer, the other by Ptolemy Physcon; and the remains on the small island of Elephantine opposite Assouan. There are but few medi\u00e6val or modern buildings of note: we may mention, however, the mosques of the 1001 Pillars and of St. Atha nasius at Alexandria ; the Citadel at Cairo, and several beautiful mosques out of a total number of 400 in that town. Historical Associations. \u2014 Aboukir Bay, near Alexandria, the scene ol the battle \" ofthe Nile,\" in which Nelson defeated the French in 1798. Alexandria, taken by the French in 1798 ; battle near it in 1801, in which Sir Ralph Abercrombie perished. Damietta, frequently besieged in the time of the Crusades ; the old town destroyed in 1251. Man soora, near Damietta, Louis IX. here imprisoned, after bis capture in 1250. Geezeh, the battle \"of the Pyramids\" in 1798, in which Na poleon defeated the Mamelukes. Cairo, founded 969 by the first of the Fatemite dynasty who ruled in Egypt. Tlie Egyptian Oases. \u2014 Closely connected with Egypt are the Oases situated westward of the valley of the Nile, viz. : the Wah-el-Baharieh or \"Little Oasis,\" S.W. of Faioum, from which it is distant 3 days' journey; the Wah-el-Khargeh or \"Great Oasis,\" 3 \\ days' journey W. of Esneh ; the Wah-el-Dakhleh or \" Western Oasis,\" about 2 days more to the W. ; and the more distant Siwah, which may be reached either from the coast of the Mediterranean at Baratoon, or by crossing the desert from the Little Oasis, from which it is 7 days distant. These oases are all famous for their excellent dates, and produce in addition liquorice, rice, dhourra, and other grains. The internal affairs of the oases are regulated by governments of a patriarchal character. The population is generally rude, ignorant, and bigoted, that of Dakhleh being, however, superior to the others. There are interesting remains of temples of Ammon both on el-Khargeh and Siwah. The towns of these two have the same name as the Oases; those of the two others are named El-Kasr, betokening the existence of ancient ruins. \u00a7 14. Nubia. \u2014 The boundaries of Nubia are defined on the N. by Egypt, and on the E. by the Red Sea. In other directions they are uncertain : sometimes the S. boundary is fixed at tho junction of the two Niles ; sometimes it is carried farther S., so as to include Sennaar and the countries lying under Abyssinia (Taka, Barea, Katarif, &c). As these latter are unimportant, they may be included under the general head of Nubia. The area may he about 290,000 sq. m., and the population above a million. Natural Features. \u2014 Nubia is usually divided into 3 portions, Upper, Central, and Lower Nubia, the positions of the first and last being decided by the river's course. The Nile is again the chief feature in"], [493, "Chap. XXI, NUBIA. 477 the physical geography. Its fall is still very moderate,1 the difference in elevation between Khartoum and Assouan being estimated at 670 ft. It assumes a spiral course between 1 8\u00b0 and 19\u00b0 N. lat., bearing away in its descent first to the E., then turning sharply round to the S.W., and again reverting to a general N. course. At the extreme E. point that it attains, it receives the Atb&ra from the Abyssinian highlands. Higher up is the junction of the Blue Nile with the main stream. Numerous rapids or cataracts occur between this latter point and the frontier of Egypt, the most extensive being near Wadi-Halfa (2 1\u00b0 53' N. lat.), or what is termed the 2nd cataract. The central region which the river traverses is a frightfully arid wilderness, termed gene rally the Nubian Desert, the portions enclosed in the bends of the Nile being known as the Desert of Bayudah on the left, and the Desert of Korosko on the right. These latter are crossed by caravan routes as short cuts between the bends. The valley of the Nile below the junction of the Atbara is narrow, in many parts leaving hardly any space between the river and the cliff, but expanding about Dongola into a comparatively wide space. The southern districts about the Atbara and the Blue Nile consist of broad grassy plains. Climate and Productions. \u2014 Nubia is intensely hot and dry. The banks of the rivers are the only cultivated ground, and on these are grown corn sufficient for the support of the thin population, together with excellent dates, which are exported to Egypt, and a certain amount of senna and tobacco. The Mimosa Nilotica is plentiful and valuable both for its gum, for the dye called henneh, and as charcoal. The cattle of Sennaar are famous for great size, and the Nubian drome daries for strength and endurance. Inhabitants, Towns. - \u2014 The inhabitants have the general name of Nubians, but in the district adjoining Egypt there is a people named the Kenoos or Kensee. The Nubians are dark, but differ from negroes both in hue and hair, the latter being long and shaggy, but not woolly. They are an active, intelligent, honest race, much sought after as do mestic servants in Egypt, whither they emigrate in large numbers ; in their own country they are addicted to tribal feuds. Previously to 1820 they formed a number of independent states, the names of which are still preserved to designate the several districts, such as Dongola, about the first bend of the Nile as one ascends the river ; Shendy (the ancient Meroe), between the Atbara and the Nile ; and Sennar, between the Blue and White Niles. In 1820 these states were reduced by the Egyptian Pasha Mehemet Ali, and now constitute the pashalic of Sennar. The country is heavily taxed and in an un thriving condition. Of the towns we may notice Khartoum (35,000), near the junction of the Niles, the chief commercial emporium for the Upper Nile, Soudan, and Abyssinia, and the seat of several European consulates; Sennar, 150 m. S.E. of Khartoum on the Blue Nile; Shendy, on the Nile midway between the junctions of the Blue Nile and the Atbara; New Dongola, a place of considerable trade, the chief town in Middle Nubia ; Derr, further N., the chief place in Lower Nubia; and Cassala, the capital of Taka. Antiquities.\u2014 Egyptian art has left traces of its presence on the Upper Nile in the temple at Kalabshee (Talmis), belonging to the Roman era ; 1 The elevation of Khartoum is given by I Petherick as 969 ft., and of Gondokoro as U23 ft. Higher elevations have been as- | signed to these stations \u20141188 ft. to IChar touin and 1900 ft to Gondokoro."], [494, "478 ABYSSINIA, ADAL, AND EAST AFRICA.

Kordofan. \u2014 Kordofan is an outl ying portion of the Egvptian posses sions, situated W. of the White Nile between 15\u00b0 20' and 11\u00b0 N. lat., aud forming a link between the valley of the Nile and Darfur. The southern district is mountainous ; the central and northern consist of a somewhat elevated plain, with occasional groups of hills. Rain falls between April and September ; the water then collects in the depressions, and the plain is covered with pasturage, affording support to the herds and flocks of the Bedouins. At other times the inhabit ants are confined to the hills, where alone water is found. The country was subdued in 1820 by Mehemet Ali. The chief town is El-Obeid, a caravan station, once of great importance, but now in a reduced con dition. South of Kordofan lies the district of Takale, which has the same general character. III. Abyssinia, Adai,, and East Africa. \u00a7 15. Abyssinia. \u2014 Abyssinia consists mainly of a lofty plateau, which rises like an island or natural fortress out of the surrounding plains, and contains within itself the sources of several of the feeders of the Nile, particularly the Abai branch of the Blue Nile and the Tacazze. Eastward, Abyssinia extends to the coast of the Red Sea opposite Massowah, but its limits in this as in other directions on the surrounding plains are very undefined, and it is usual, though probably not correct, to include under the title a very considerable stretch of the lowlands on the side both of Nubia and the Red Sea. In the former direction Abyssinia nominally extends along the rt. bank of the Atbara to the confluence of the Tacazze. In the more restricted application of the name the area of the country may be about 158,000 sq. m., and its population 3,000,000. Natural Features. \u2014 The Abyssinian plateau rises from the plain of the Red Sea by 3 terraces, the first of which is buttressed on the E. by tbe Taranta range running parallel to the Red Sea at an interval of from 30 to 40 m. ; the second, entitled the plain of Tigre, occupies a more elevated region between the upper courses of the rivers MareD and Tacazze ; while the third, the table-land of Amhara, is supported on the side of the Tacazze by the Sarnen range, which contains the culminating heights of Abba Yared (15,000 ft.) and Buahat (14,36+ ft.), and extends thence W. to Lake Dembea. S. of Lake Dembea is a very elevated region enclosed in a fold of the Abai, and containing the Talba Waha range. On the S.W. the plateau descends abruptly to the plains of the Nile ; on the N.W. the slope is probably more gradual along the line of tlie Tacazze. The passes by which the highland is attainable from the side of the Red Sea are steep and rugged ; that of Koomaylee, which the British forces followed in 1867-8, has its outlet about 14 m. from Zoulla on Annesley Bay, and emerges on the table-land of Senafe, 65 m. from Zuulla, and 7500 ft. above it. The rivers run in deep ravines grooved out of the table-land, with banks rising almost pre cipitously to extraordinary heights. Partly from this cause and partly from the varying height of contiguous table-lands, it is diffi-"], [495, "Chap. XXI. ABYSSINIA. 479 cult to give accurate estimates of the general elevation of the ter races. The fluctuations of the elevation are indeed extraordinary. In Amhara. for instance, the contiguous table-lands of Entshetquab and Wogghera are separated by a valley (that of the Shoad'a) 4000 ft. lower than the former, the elevations of the plains them selves being respectively 10,000 ft. and 8500 ft. The Wogghera, again, bas adjacent to it on the N. the table-land of Adarga, hardly more than 3000 ft., with which it is connected by the difficult Pass of Lamalmon. The plain of Gojam, at the S.E. bend of the Abai, is only 2500 ft. high ; that of Lake Dembea higher up the river course is 6120 ft.; while the intervening country rises to above 11,000 ft. this being the elevation of a pass at a point by no means the highest iu the region. To take one more instance : in the south of Shoa the table-land is nearly 9000 ft. high, and the lowland in the valley of the Hawash, but a few miles off, only 2000 ft. The heights of the towns above the sea, in feet, are as follows: Ankobar, 8198; Gondar, 7420- Axum, 7092 ; Adowa, 6216; Shoa, 3000. The chief rivers are the Abai,' which rises near Lake Dembea at an elevation of 8700 ft., enters that lake on the S.W., issues from it near the S.E. angle, and makes a horse shoe bend to the S.E. before, assuming its northerly direction, de scending with such rapidity that within 40 m. of Lake Dembea it is only 2259 ft. above the sea ; the Tacazze or Settite which rises E. of L. Dembea, on the S. verge of the plateau, and flows in a deep valley N.E. to 13\u00b0 30' N. lat. and thence N.W. to its confluence with the Atbara in 14\u00b0 30', receiving 1. the Royan ; the Atbara, which is a less important stream than the Tacazze, though it gives name to the joint river; it rises N.W. of L. Dembea and flows N., receiving rt. the Salaam and numerous lesser rivers from the W. face of the highlands ; the Mareb or Gash, which rises in the N.E. district and flows N.W. in the direction of the Atbara, but is absorbed by the sands near Cassala in about 15\u00b0 30' N. lat. ; and the Hawash, which drains the southerly regions and flows S.E., terminating in Lake Aussa about 41\u00b0 30' E. long. The Lakes Dembea or Tzana aud Assal have been previously noticed ; the former bas a circuit of 200 m. Lake Ashangi, on the E. of the plateau, lies at an elevation of 7 500 ft. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The climate of Abyssinia varies with the elevation, from the overpowering heat of its low valleys to the almost perpetual snows of the mountain tops. The table-lands of medium height (say 6000-8000 ft.) seem to enjoy on the whole a moderate temperature, resembling that of Southern Europe : the table-land of Dembea, in particular, seems most highly favoured. Rain falls heavily between June and October, and at other seasons with less violence. The productions are as varied as the temperature : at the lower levels a tropical vegetation luxuriates ; on the table-lands just specified grow the ordinary European cereals and fruits, while the highest Alpine regions yield only summer pastures. Among the special productions we may notice the poa Abyssinia, a leguminous plant in common use for bread, coffee of poor quality growing wild iu the W., myrrh, and various medicinal plants. The Sanga ox is famed for its enormous horns : locusts are numerous and commit terrible devastations ; bees are highly prized for their honey. Wild animals abound, elephants, lions, leopards, hippopotami, &c. Minerals are scarce, with the excep tion of coal and iron, the latter of first-rate quality ; salt is found in large quantities between the table-land and the Red Sea. Inhabitants and Towns. \u2014 The population of Abyssinia is supposed to"], [496, "ABYSSINIA, ADAL, AKD EAST AFRICA. Book III. 480 be of Caucasian origin and allied to the Arabians. Some of the branches exhibit considerable resemblance to the negroes, but the colour is dark brown rather than black and the hair curly rather than woolly. The occupants of tbe E. and N.E. are the most free from these characteristics. The language or languages of the country are called Amharic : they are connected with the ancient Gheez, and belong to the Shemitic family. A rude form of Christianity has prevailed among them from the time of the Emperor Constantine : the Shohoes, in the eastern valleys, are Mohammedans. The political condition of Abyssinia is of an uncertain character : the country is divided into various districts, some of which have at times been the seats of powerful independent governments, particularly Tigre in the N.E., Amhara in the centre, and Shoa in the S.E. Theodore claimed the title, and for a while exer cised the authority of Emperor of Abyssinia ; but his influence had waned before his fatal contest with Great Britain in 1868. The state of the country somewhat resembles that of Europe in the feudal period, each chieftain exercising what power he can in the neighbourhood of his own amba, as the hill fortresses are called. The chief towns are Gondar, N. of Lake Dembea, the capital of the country, and the resi dence of the Abuna or patriarch of the Abyssinian Church ; Antalo, the capital of Tigre, on a high plain near the sources of the Atbara ; Adowa, in Tigre ; and Ancobar, on a branch of the Hawash, in Shoa. Magdala, the stronghold of Theodore, in which British subjects were confined until their rescue in 1868, lies on the S. verge of the plateau, near the river Bashilo. Commerce. \u2014 The foreign commerce of Abyssinia is carried on at Mas sowah, a small coral island in the Red Sea about 2u0 yards from the main land, with a population of 1000, subject to the Pasha of Jeddah. The merchandise consists of a little gold, ivory, musk, coffee, ghee (rancid butter), dhourra, honey, and wax, which are chiefly brought down twice in the year by caravans. Business is for the most part conducted by barter, the imports consisting of silks, cottons, sugar, and rice. The slave trade is ruthlessly prosecuted by the Turks on the frontier, and has closed the country against European influence : the name of Habshi or Abyssinian is equivalent to \" slave.\" \u00a7 16. Adal and East Africa. \u2014 Adal is the name given to the region intervening between the Abyssinian highland and the sea, from Massowah in the N. to the Bay of Tajurra (the extreme W. point of the Gulf of Aden) in the S., a distance of some 300 m. It is occupied by a nomad race called the Danakil or Dankali, whose ethnological affinities have not as yet been ascertained. The country attains its greatest breadth in the S., where it occupies a slightly elevated table-land (about 2000 ft. high), bounded S. by the river HawaBh. The capital is Aussa on the banks of that river. North wards the country contracts gradually until it is confined to a narrow strip of coast along the Red Sea. Annesley Bay, S. of Mas sowah, offers the best harbourage on this coast. Numerous coral isles fringe the coast. The plain near Massowah is burnt up, as with the heat of an oven, during the summer, the heat averaging from 115\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 in the shade; in the rainy season a luxuriant herbage springs up. France claims certain maritime positions on"], [497, "Chap. XXI. ADAL AND EAST AFRICA. 481 this coast, viz. : \u2014 Zoullah, on A nnesley Bay, the isles of Desset and Ouda, the port of Edd, in 13\u00b0 58' N. lat., and Obook, in 12\u00b0 N. lat. East Africa. \u2014 The eastern coast of Africa between the Strait of Bab-el- Mandeb and C. Delgado, in 10\u00b0 41' S. lat., is but little known. Its commercial and political relations are chiefly with Arabia, and a con siderable traffic is carried on with the interior, tbe exports being tlaves, ivory, and tropical products. Following the line of coast from Abyssinia southwards, we meet with the following states : \u2014 (1) Harar, so named after its capital, which trades with tbe ports of Zeyla and Berberah on the Gulf of Aden, sending thither slaves, coffee, gum, myrrh, &c. (2) The Somauli country, in the eastern peninsula, about C. Guardafui. (3) Ajan, S. of C. Guardafui to about 3\u00b0 N. lat., an unvisited region. (4) Zanguebar, between 4\u00b0 N. lat. and 12\u00b0 S. lat., belonging chiefly to the Sultan of Oman, and containing the towns Magadoxo, in 2\u00b0 2' N. lat., the capital of a region between tho rivers Haines and Juba ; Melinda, now held by the Gallas ; Mombas, in 4\u00b0 4' S. lat., on an island of the same name, occupied by the English in 1824-6, and now a missionary station; Zanzibar, in 6\u00b0 27' N. lat., also an island and regarded as the capital of the African possessions of the Sultan of Oman ; and Quiloa, 8\u00b0 57' S. lat., similarly situated, and once a place of importance. The Portuguese traded extensively with Zanguebar iu the 16th and 17th cents., and established several settle ments on the coast. Mombas and Zanzibar have come into notice as starting points for exploring expeditions into Central Africa. In the interior we may notice : (1) The Galla country, extending from Abyssinia to the Equator, a varied region, at an elevation of from 6000 to 8000 ft., including Kaffa, immediately S. of Abyssinia about the river Godjeb. (2) Masai, a high rolling plateau between Kili manjaro aud the Victoria Nyanza. (3) Unyamuezi, \"the country of the moon,\" a district of similar character, with rich well-watered valleys and at a general elevation of from 3000 to 4000 ft., occupied by an intelligent and active population, skilled In weaving and iron-making. (4) Uganda, a luxuriantly wooded country N.W. of the Victoria Nyanza, with a settled population, good high-roads, and other tokens of civilization. Y MOD. GEO."], [498, "482 Book III.

Barbary. \u2014 Barbary is a name applied somewhat indefinitely to the region in which the so-called Berbers form or once formed the basis of the population, and which is supposed to extend from the frontier of Egypt along the Mediterranean Sea to the shores of the Atlantic. The name appears to have originated with the Arabs at the time of the Saracen conquest, the native population being by them generically termed \" Berbers,\" though the geographical designation \" Barbary \" was restricted to the present Algeria. Tho Berbers are in point of fact identical with the \" Kabyles,\" who still form the chief element in the population of that country. In other parts Arabs and Moors predominate, and therefore the name is hardly appropriate in the present age, though it has been surmised, with"], [499, "Chap. XXII. 483 TRIPOLI AND FEZZAN. some degree of probability, that at one period a homogeneous popula tion spread over the whole of North Africa. Adopting the title in its usual sense, Barbary has a length of about 2000 m. from E. to W., and includes the political divisions of Tripoli, Tunis, Algeria, and Marocco, the two first nominally subject to the Porte, the third a French colony, and the fourth an independent empire. It in cludes three natural divisions : \u2014 the plateau of Barca ; the low desert plain between the Syrtes ; and the Atlas region or \" Africa Minor,\" as Hitter has termed it ; the two first coinciding with the political division of Tripoli, and the third with the three remaining countries. \u00a7 2. Tripoli and Fezzan. \u2014 Tripoli lies along the coast of the Mediterranean between the llth and 25th meridians, having Egypt as its conterminous country on the E. and Tunis on the W, The area of Tripoli (Fezzan included) is estimated at about 345,000 sq. m., and the population at 750,000. Natural Features. \u2014 Tripoli includes two regions of very distinct cha racter: \u2014 (1) the plateau of Barca, which projects northwards to the E. of the Gulf of Sidra ; and (2) the low maritime plain between the Gulfs of Sidra and Cabes. The heights which form the edge of the plateau of Barca run parallel to the coast, and skirt it closely between Tolmeita and Ras-el-Hilal. The plateau attains its greatest height in the W., and subsides gradually towards the E. and S. The maritime plain is bounded S. by ranges running parallel to the coast at an interval vary ing from 10 to 20 m. : of these ranges we may specify the Tarhoona and Gharian between the 12th and loth meridians. The coast is one of the most inhospitable in tbe world, generally low and sandy, with very few harbours, and 'these small and becoming continually smaller from silt. Soil and Productions. \u2014 Fertile and barren districts alternate through out Tripoli, the presence or absence of moisture being the chief cause of the difference in this respect, though in many parts the sandiness of the soil renders it hopelessly barren. The hilly districts and the plains just below the hills are fertile, and many of the maritime plains, such as those about Mesurata and Lebda, and the Mesheesha, E. of Tripoli, are remarkably productive. The most barren parts are the sandy tract S. of the Gulf of Sidra ; the marshy region W. of that gulf; and the maritime plain W. of Tripoli. The plateau of Barca is well wooded and has a sufficiency of springs. As to the interior, it may be said generally that it is barren for the greater part of the year, but covered with pasture after the autumnal rains. The productions of the country are dates, olives, and various cereals, including dhourra. Inhabitants and Towns. \u2014 The population of Tripoli consists mainly of Arabs, intermingled with Jews, Moors, and Turks. The Jews and Moors are engaged in commerce. The chief town, Tripoli (15,500), stands on a small promontory jutting out into the Mediterranean in 13\u00b0 11' E. long: it is the shipping port for a large district in Central Africa. Mesurata, at the W. extremity of the Gulf of Sidra, carries on carpet manufactures. Benghazi is the chief town iu Barca. Fezzan. \u2014 Fezzan is a large oasis or rather cluster of oases, connected politically and commercially with Tripoli, and situated S.E. of the t jwu of that name. The district is of an oval shape, and lies between y 2"], [500, "484 TUNIS. Book III. 23\u00b0 30' and 31\u00b0 N. lat., 12\u00b0 and 18\u00b0 E. long. A considerable portion of the interior is pure desert : the number of oases or fertile spots may amount to about 100, that being, at all events, the number of the towns and villages. Various ranges traverse it, two of which, known as the White and Black Harudsch, run in parallel lines. The chief production is dates, whicb supply food both to man and beast, not to speak of other useful purposes served by the wood and leaves ; natron is found there in great abundance. The population, estimated at 26,000, consists of Arabs, Moors, and Touaricks. A lively caravan trade is carried on with Soudan in one direction, and with Tripoli in another ; the articles of commerce being slaves, ivory, gums, and me dicinal herbs of various kinds. Mourzouk (2000), in the very centre of the district, ranks as capital. The oases of Aujila and Maradeh also belong to Tripoli, but are comparatively unimportant : they lie S. of Barca. Gadames, another dependency of Tripoli, with a town of the same name, in 30\u00b0 9' N. lat., 9\u00b0 18' E. long., is an important trading post between the coast and the interior. \u00a7 3. Tunis. \u2014 Tunis occupies the N.E. angle of the Atlas region, and is bounded N. and E. by the Mediterranean Sea, S. by the Great Desert, and W. by Algeria, from which it is separated by a boundary-line running somewhat E. of the 8th meridian. Its area is estimated at 46,000 sq. m., and its population at 600,000. Natural Features. \u2014 The coast line is varied by the Gulf of Cabes in the S.E. ; the Gulf of Hammamet more to the N. ; the Bay of Tunis in tbe N.E. between Capes Bon and Farina ; and the less important Gulf of Bizerta more to the W. The surface is broken by outlying ranges of the Atlas system, running with a certain amount of parallelism in a N.E. direction. The Mejerdah is the principal river : it drains the greater part of the northern district, and reaches the sea near C. Farina. In the central district the Fekka and other lesser rivers are received by a lake of considerable size named Kairwan. On the verge of the desert there is a large salt marsh named Shott-el-Mellah. Soil and Productions. \u2014 The country adjacent to the Gulf of Cabes is barren ; but, with this exception, Tunis has a productive soil, and was regarded in ancient times as the \"granary\" of the Roman Empire. The date i3 the most valued fruit in the S., while in the N. European and sub-tropical fruits flourish. Among the special productions of the adjacent seas may be noticed the coral found near Tabarca, and the tunny fish of the N. coast, for the sake of which the coasts are visited by Europeans. Inhabitants and Toivns. \u2014 The population of Tunis consists of Moors, Arabs, Berbers, Turks, and Jews, the several proportions not being accurately known. Arabic is the language generally current, but in the seaports the Lingua Franca is the medium of communication with foreigners. The viceroy, styled Bey, though nominally subject to the Porte, is really independent, and holds power by hereditary right. The country is tolerably well governed, and commerce is on the advance. Tunis (150,000), the capital, stands on the W. side of a large lagoon communicating with the Gulf of Tunis. Its streets are narrow, tortuous, and dirty ; its fortifications are iu a decaying state, and the town is commanded by surrounding heights. The well-known fez cap is"], [501, "485 Chap. XXII. ALGERIA. largely manufactured here. Goletta, at the neck of the lagoon, serves as the port of Tunis. Kairwan, 70 m. S. of Tunis, ranks as the second town in the country : it was founded by the Arabs in 672, served as the capital of their West African possessions, and still ranks as the \" holy city \" of Africa, with a magnificent mosque. Bizerta, W. of Tunis, is a place of active commerce. Islands. \u2014 Off the coast of Tunis are the islands Jerbah at the S. entrance of the Gulf of Cabes, the Karkenna Isles more to the N., and Pantellaria off the N.E. angle, the last being an appendage of the Italian kingdom. \u00a7 4. Algeria. \u2014 Algeria stretches along the seaboard of the Medi terranean from the river Zayne in the E. to the Kiss and the frontier of Marocco in the W., a distance of about 600 m. Inland it extends across Atlas to the Great Desert, its most southerly point being the Oasis of Mezzab, about 32\u00b0 N. lat. Its area is estimated at 258,310 sq. m., and its population at 2,999,124. Natural Features. \u2014 The coast-line of Algeria is broken by a succes sion of bays, which do not, however, offer the usual amount of pro tection for shipping in consequence of their openness. The chief of these gulfs from E. to W. are Bona, Storah, Bougiah, Algiers, and Arzen. The headlands are very numerous, but unimportant. The best natural harbours are at Mers-el-Kebir, near Oran, capable of hold ing 100 men-of-war, and strongly defended ; Mostaganem, near the mouth of tbe Shelif ; and Bonah, on the gulf of the same name. The port of Algiers is not naturally good. There are roadsteads also at Storah, Collo, Bougiah, Dellys, Cherchell, Arzeu (good), and Nemours, on the frontier of Marocco. The Algerian \" Tell \" is a varied district, consisting of mountain knots, ranges, spacious upland plains, and narrow valleys; its average breadth may be about 60 m. The \"Sahara\" is divided into two parts by tbe ranges of the Great Atlas : the northern division is the least fertile of the two, and consists of open wastes insuf ficiently watered by rivers which discharge themselves into salt lakes, de scribed by the names Shott and Sebkha : the southern division has a large number of springs, each of which is the nucleus of an oasis. The general character of the mountain ranges has been already described : the most noticeable points are Jerjura (in the Little Atlas), the spurs of wdiich ramify through Great Kabylia; Warensenis, S. ofthe Shelif, the most lofty and confused part of the Middle Atlas ; the Aures, in the Great Atlas, S. of Constantine, where the system is broken up into 3 great ranges, distinguished as the Eastern, Western, and Northern Aures ; and Djebel Amoor, about 2\u00b0 E. long. The chief rivers from E. to W. are : \u2014 the Sebous, which joins the sea at the Gulf of Bona ; the Kummel, which flows by Constantine ; the Sahel, which joins Bougiah Bay ; and the Shelif, the most important of all, which rises in the Djebel Amoor of the Great Atlas, crosses the Sahara by Taguin, and in its course through the Tell sweeps round from the N.E. to the W., and reaches the sea on the E. side of the Gulf of Arzeu. In the northern division of the Sahara there are numerous large lakes which receive the drainage, and which have led to this portion of Algeria being designated \"the region of the Shotts.\" The most important from E. to W. are the Shott-el-Saida, or simply El-Shott, on the plateau of Hodna, the receptacle of the Barika, Hamm, and other rivers ; the two lakes of"], [502, "486 ALGERIA. Book III. Zarhez, on the plateau of the same name ; the Shott-el-Shergui, the receptacle of the Nador and numerous other streams ; and the Shott el-Gharbi. The southern Sahara contains the Jeddi, a river of consider able length, which rises in about 2\u00b0 E. long., and runs eastward to about 6\u00b0 E. long., where it falls into the Shott-el-Melghirg ; the Brizina, which rises in the neighbourhood of the Jeddi, and flows in the opposite direction towards Marocco ; and a number of lesser rivers, which rise on the southern slope of a range bounding the basin of the Jeddi, and flow into the Great Desert. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The climate of Algeria is on the whole temperate, and in parts well adapted to Europeans. The summer heat, ranging from 74\u00b0 to 104\u00b0, is certainly high, but in the prox imity of the coast the sea breezes render even this heat endurable : it is only when the south wiud blows that the atmosphere is suffocating. In winter the thermometer ranges from 54\u00b0 to 65\u00b0. The rainy season falls iu November and December. The natural resources of Algeria are considerable, but at present very imperfectly developed. . The Tell produces cereals in abundance, including in places maize, millet, and rice. Timber is found near the sea in Kabylia. Fruit thrives everywhere, but is more particularly the specific production of the oases in the Sahara, which yield dates, figs, and olives. The merino sheep i3 a native of Algeria ; horses, goats, and camels are the other most valuable domesticated animals. Bees-wax is abundant about Bougiah, and the French name for a wax-candle (bougie) is derived from the port whence it is shipped. Along the coasts coral and sponge are found. The mineral resources are imperfectly known ; iron, lead, and copper mines are worked. Inhabitants. \u2014 The population of Algeria consists of about two mil lions of Arabs, 700,000 Kabyles, and a sprinkling of Moore, Jews, Turks, and Europeans, of whom there were in 1861, 192,746, inclusive of 63,786 military men. The Kabyles live chiefly in the hilly districts about the river Sahel, named after them Great and Little Kabylia ; they are a warlike independent race, who have offered a most sturdy resistance to the French. Their chief occupations are agriculture and iron-working. The Arabs predominate in the oases of the Sahara ; they also offered a spirited resistance to the French under the influence of religious fanaticism. The Moors frequent the towns, while the Jews are scattered everywhere. The French commenced the conquest of Algeria in 1830, and have at length succeeded in establishing a military occupation of the country : thus far they have failed in their industrial schemes, and it is questionable whether they will ever render it a remunerative or prosperous colony. Political Divisions and Toivns. \u2014 Algeria is divided into 3 provinces : \u2014 Constantine in the E. ; Algiers in the middle ; and Oran in the W. The administration is chiefly military, but in the parts where a European population prevails, a civil system is established. The capital, Algiers (Fr. Alger), is well situatod on an amphitheatrical slope at the bottom of a deep bay : it is strongly fortified, and under French dominion has assumed in parts the appearance of a European town with broad streets, shops, &c. : the original port wTas small and shallow, but by means of a mole a sufficiently large naval port has been lately formed. The population of Algiers consists of 30,000 Europeans and 15,000 natives. Constantine (35,000), the capital of the eastern province, is strongly posted on a rocky peninsula, surrounded on 3 sides by deep ravines in which the river Rumniel flows. Oran (20,000), the capital"], [503, "Chap. XXII. MAROCCO. 487 of the western province, stands on the shore of the bay named after it, and has for its port Mers-el-Kebir, 3 m. distant, its own harbour being very poor: it belonged to the Spaniards between 1509 and 1791, with the exception of the years 1708-1732, and was strongly fortified by them. We may further notice : \u2014 Blidah, the military headquarters of the middle province, S.W. of Algiers ; Orleansville, iu the valley of the Shelif; Philippeville, which serves as the port of Constantine ; and Mascara, S.E. of Oran, the headquarters of the famous Abd-el-Kader. Bougiah was the capital of the Vandals, and became a \"holy city\" of the Mohammedans in the Middle Ages. \u00a7 5. Marocco. \u2014 Marocco or, as the Arabs term it, Moghrib-ul- Acsa, \" the extreme west,\" occupies the N.W. angle of the African continent, and is bounded N.E. by Algeria, N. by the Mediterranean, W. by the Atlantic, and S. and S.E. by the Great Desert : its limit on the coast of the Atlantic is at the river Nun in 28\u00b0 35' N. lat. Its area is estimated at 260,000 sq. m., and its population at 2,750,000. Natural Features. \u2014 The surface of Marocco is much broken by the various ranges of the Atlas system : of these little is known, and we need only notice the maritime range called El Riff, S.E. of the Strait of Gibraltar, from which the Riff coast, infamous for many an act of savage piracy, derives its name. The chief rivers are : \u2014 the Mulawia, falling into the Mediterranean near the Algerian frontier ; the Seboo, Morbeya or Omerbegh, Tensift, and Sus, falling into the Atlantic ; the Draa, which rises on the southern slope of Atlas, traverses the Great Desert, and is supposed to reach the Atlantic by the course of the Nun or El-Aksa, S. of Cape Nun ; and the Zys and Gur, which also rise on the S. slope of Atlas and flow into the Great Desert. The natural capacities of the soil are known to be considerable from the statements of the Roman writers, but agriculture, as well as every other art, has fallen into desuetude in this semi-barbarous country. The climate is temperate and healthy. Inhabitants, Political Divisions, and Towns. \u2014 The population consists mainly of Berbers and Moors in about equal proportions, with a sub sidiary number of Arabs and Jews. The Berbers proper live in the north about the Riff coast, and an allied tribe of the same race, the Shelluhs, occupies the Atlas ranges. The Moors prevail in the central regions. The Arabs are of the Bedouin class, and roam over the plains. The government is a despotism, the sovereign being styled \"sultan.\" The empire consists of the following divisions -.\u2014Fez, a kingdom in cluding the northern district down to the river Morbeya ; Marocco, a kingdom extending from the Morbeya to the Sus in the S. and inland to Atlas; Sus, a province between the rivers Sus and Nun; Draa, Tafilelt, and Segelmessa, districts on the S. side of Atlas : the first about the river of the same name, the second about the Zys, and tlie third more to the E., all of them in the Sahara. The capital Marocco or Marakash, \"the beautiful,\" as the Moors term it, founded in 1073, stands near the Tensift, and is a poor town with narrow streets and low mud houses, with its aqueducts and fountains in a ruinous state : its population is estimated at 80,000, and the chief manufactures are leather work, embroidery, and silk. Fez ranks as the second town ; it stands near the Seboo, is the seat of a university, and"], [504, "488 SAHARA, Book III. ranks as the \" holy city \" with 300 mosques. Mogador, the chief port, and the point for communication with the capital, was founded in 1760, and is built in European fashion. We may further notice Tangier, a port at the western entrance of the Strait of Gibraltar, the residence of European merchants and consuls; and Ceuta, opposite Gibraltar, the property of Spain, to which also belong PeSon de Velez, Alhucemas, and Mililla, all on the N. coast, and used as presidios or convict establish ments. \u00a7 6. Sahara.\u2014 The Sahara,1 which stretches as a broad band across the continent between the fertile regions of Atlas on the N. and those of the Niger and Lake Tchad on the S., has been well described by the Arabs as \" a sea without water.\" It resembles the ocean in its waves of sand, its frequently unbroken horizon, its islands or oases, its silence and solitude. In different parts, however, it varies considerably in character : sometimes sand predominates, at other times gravel or bare rock : sometimes the desert is a plain, else where ridges and hills occur. The Sahara is divided into halves of unequal size by a series of oases intersecting it from N. to S. between Tripoli and Lake Tchad. The western and largest half is termed the Sahel or -\" plain : \" in it the sand accumulates through the prevalence of violent easterly winds, which carry it westward in dense clouds, heaping it up in high hills on the sea shore, lining the coast with dangerous sandbanks, and occasionally carrying it out far into the Atlantic. The oases in the Sahel are rarer and smaller than those in the other half : the herbage consists of a few alkaline piants, thistles, and dwarf acacias : the most valuable product is salt, which is conveyed in great quantities to Soudan, where that article is deficient. In the eastern half, which is distinguished as the Sahara Proper or the Libyan Desert, the surface is broken by ravines, and wadys, in which rain occasionally collects. Springs are more abundant, and extensive areas supply a scanty herbage or are decked with various species of artemisia. Oases are numerous and render travelling comparatively easy. The area of the whole Desert is estimated at 2,436,400 sq. m., and the population at 4,000,000. Inhabitants. \u2014 The inhabitants of the western division, or Sahel, are of two classes : Moors between the Atlantic Ocean and the caravan route that connects Timbuctoo and Draa ; and Touaricks or, as they call themselves, Imoscharh, eastward of that line. The latter belong to the Berber stock and lead a nomadic life, partly in quest of herbage for their herds, but still more as conductors of the caravan trade. The central portions of the eastern division of the Sahara are occupied by the Tibboos or Teda, a black race approximating to, but deviating in several respects from the true negro type, Bedouin Arabs wander over the northern and southern borders. 1 The term \" Sahara \" is properly ap- j region called the Sahara to the N. of Atlaa plied not to the desert itself, but lo the intervening between it and the TeU or partly cultivated region of osses and pas- wholly cultivated land : this extends aa ture-lands on its border. Thus there is a I far N. as the lakes of El-Shott and Zarhes."], [505, "Chap. XXII. SENEGAMBIA AND SIERRA LEONE. 489 Oases and Towns.\u2014 Of the special spots or oases we may notice : \u2014 (1) in the western Sahel , Arguin, ou the coast ofthe Atlantic, S. of Cape Blanco, with 3 islands in the adjacent bay, one of which is also called Arguin ; Portendik, considerably to the S., a trading station of the French ; Wadan, in 20\u00b0 40' N. lat., 11\u00b0 W. long., one of the chief depots for salt ; Ludamar, a state between the Senegal and Timbuctoo, with the towns Benowm and Kemmoo ; Walata, a large commercial town, between Benowm and Timbuctoo ; and Arawan, an oasis and town, N.E. of Walata, the focus of numerous caravan routes. (2) In the Touarick country, Tuat or Twat, an oasis in about 28\u00b0 30' N. lat. 1\u00b0 E. long. ; Ghat, in 25\u00b0 3' N. lat., 1 0\u00b0 30' E. long., a considerable trading place between the north and Soudan ; and Air or Asben, a mountainous region, with Agades ( 17\u00b0 N. lat. 8\u00b0 E. long.) for its capital, once a town containing 50,000 inhabitants, but now sunk to 7000, and still possessing a handsome mosque. (3) In the Tibboo country, Bilma, between Fezzan and Lake Tchad, rich in salt, and well supplied with water ; and Yen, to the E. of Bilma. \u00a7 7. Senegambia and Sierra Leone. \u2014 The name Senegambia must originally have been confined to the region included between the lower courses of the rivers Senegal and Gambia, the word being merely a combination of these two river-names. At present, however, the title is extended to the district S. of the Gambia as far as Sierra Leone and even occasionally to Sherbro' Island in 7\u00b0 30' N. lat., a distance of about 1000 m. Inland it may extend to an average breadth of 200 m., thus giving it an area of about 200,000 sq. m. \u00b0 Natural Features, Inhabitants, &c. \u2014 Senegambia includes the western terraces of the highland of Soudan and the maritime lowland. The rivers form the leading feature in this country : the most important from N. to S. are the Senegal, the Gambia, the Eio Grande, and the Sierra Leone, the comparative size of which is also expressed in the order assigned. These rivers have been sufficiently described in the preceding chapter. The climate is unhealthy for Europeans, the heat and rain combining to foster a luxuriant vegetation, which in turn pro- duces malaria about the embouchures of the rivers. April and May are the hottest months. The rains fall in the summer months and conduce to lower the temperature. The most valued products are gum produced from the mimosa and other trees, teak and mahogany wood, palm-oil, and cotton. The native population consists of 3 distinct races : \u2014 the Jaloofs (1 million) between the Senegal and Cape Verd, a people ofa very low stamp, chiefly living by the chase ; the Foulahs in the interior about the sources of the Senegal and the western slopes, people of gentle manners and civilized habits, living in towns and agriculturists, aud of a remarkably light hue for negroes ; and the Mandingoes (about 7 millions), who live more to the S., engaged in commerce and manu- factures, and holding the first place in point of intelligence. The two last, which are in every respect of greater importance than the first, probably have an infusion of Moorish blood in their composition and so belong partly to the Caucasian family. European Settlements. \u2014 European nations have effected numerous settlements on the coast, the French about the Senegal with Fort St. Louis (15,000) for their head-quarters and with a subject population of 145,800, including the recently incorporated province of Cayor to the Y 3"], [506, "490 GUINEA. Book III. N. of the Senegal ; tbe English about the Gambia, with Bathurst (7000) as their head-quarters ; and the Portuguese about the Rio Grande, Jeba bein\" their chief town, but one of the Bissago isles the seat of govern ment. The most important of the English settlements on the W. coast of Africa is Sierra Leone, situated on a peninsula in 8\u00b0 30' N. lat., and established in connexion with the suppression of the slave trade ; the population consists mainly of liberated slaves, who are here educated by missionaries and are returned to their native countries as the pioneers of civilization and true religion : the capital, named Freetown, stands at the N. of the peninsula aud on the left bank of the Sierra Leone river. The area of the colony is 465 sq. m., and its population 41,624. \u00a7 8. Guinea. \u2014 Guinea (in the usual acceptation of the term) ex tends from Sherbro' Island in the W. to Old Calabar river in the E., a distance of about 1800 m. We may include under this head the stretch of coast surrounding the Bight of Biafra to Cape Lopez, where Lower Guinea is supposed to commence. Natural Features, &c. \u2014 Little is known of this extensive region beyond the coast, which is visited by Europeans for purposes of trade. The general character above ascribed to Senegambia may be applied to Guinea also \u2014 intense heat, heavy tropical rains, dense vegetation, aud a deadly climate. The scarcity of navigable rivers along the Gulf of Guinea makes the interior more than usually inaccessible. The Niger, Quorra, or Joliba, offers, by its enormous delta and the network of streams that covers it, abundant access to the eastern district: but, with the exception of this and the two rivers Volta and Assinee in the Ashantee territory, there are no streams of any known value. Between the Volta and the delta of the Niger extensive lagoons line the coast, two of which, Avon Waters aud Denham Waters, penetrate deeply iuto the Dahomey territory. The cocoa-nut palm is again the most valuable commercial product. The sugarcane, indigo, and coffee-plant grow wild ; the yam is the most important vegetable ; and a number of dyes and spices are found. The rainy season falls between November and May on the coast of Liberia, and between May and November in Ashantee. The Harmattan, or N. E. wind, prevails from December to March on the Gold Coast, aud produces the driest season. Inhabitants. \u2014 The native population of Guinea consists of Mandingoes on the slopes of the Kong Mountains and numerous tribes of negroes between the mountains and the coast, exhibiting various degrees of civilization down to the lowest barbarism. The states on the coast with which Europeans are most brought into contact are Ashantee (4^ millions) between the rivers Assinee aud Volta ; Dahomey M 50,000) E. of the latter ; and Yoruba (3 millions) with its capital Abbeokonta, yet more E. The slave trade has exercised a very demoralizing effect throughout the interior, leading to constant war, insecurity, and brutalism. In Dahomey the royal body-guard consists of regiments of female soldiers. European Settlements. \u2014 The coast is commonly divided into sections distinguished as far as the Niger according to their special productions or articles of commerce. Proceeding from W. to E. we meet with the Grain Coast, between Capes Mesurado and Palmas, so called from the pungent \"grains of Paradise \" (amomum granum Paradisi). This"], [507, "SOUDAN OR NIGRITIA. 491 Chap. XXII. portion of the coast, together with that which lies AV. of Mesurado to the river Shebar is occupied by Liberia, a republic founded in 1822 by American philanthropists as a retreat for the free negroes of the United States, of whom there are supposed to be about 8000 1 with a native population of about 250,000 ; the capital is Monrovia. Next follows the Ivory Coast, between Capes Palmas and Three Points, about 400 m. long, containing the French settlement of Grand Bassam, W. of the Assinee river ; then the Gold Coast, between Cape Three Points and the river Volta, containing the following English settlements :\u2014 Cape Coast Castle, a fortress on a granite rock overlooking the sea, with a native town adjoining, founded by the Swedes in 1652, acquired by the Danes in 1658, by the Dutch in 1659, and by the English in 1664 ; Anamaboe, 10 m. to the E. ; Accra, in 0\u00b0 12' W. long. ; Christiansborg, 30 m. N.E. of Accra, purchased from the Danes in 1850 ; and Dixcove, in 1\u00b0 57' W. long.. The Dutch2 settlement of St. George d'Elmina stands a little W. of Cape Coast Castle. The Slave Coast lies along the Bight of Benin between the rivers Volta and Benin, with Whydah as the chief trading port and the residence of European merchants, Badagry, and Lagos (an English settlement) more to the E. The Coast of Calabar, between the rivers Benin and Camaroons, comprises the full width of the delta of the Niger and the coast intervening between the Old Calabar and Camaroons rivers : the former is an almost uninhabit able region, covered with impenetrable forest and much of it under water during the rainy season ; Bonny and Brass are the chief trading stations near the sea in the delta itself : on the Old Calabar river are Duke Town and Creek Town, mission-posts. The lofty chain of the Camaroons Mountains separates the basins of the Camaroons and Old Calabar. Lastly, we may notice the Coast of Biafra, lying along the Bight of Biafra between the Camaroons and Cape Lopez, otherwise called the Gaboon Coast from the chief river in that district, on which the French have trading establishments. In the angle of the Bight of Biafra is the island of Fernando Po, so named after its Portuguese discoverer Ferdo do Pao, mountainous (with a volcanic peak rising 10,190 ft.) and densely wooded, with an English settlement, Clarence, on its N. coast. The Spaniards reckon the island among their colonial possessions. More S. are Princes Island and Isle St. Thomas, belonging to Portugal, with a joint popu lation of 12,250, both islands mountainous, with a peak on St. Thomas rising to 7020 ft. The small island of Ajinobon, in 1\u00b0 24' S. lat., belongs to Spain. \u00a7 9. Soudan or Nigritia. \u2014 Soudan, or more fully Beled-el-Soudan \" the land of the Blacks,\" is the title current among the Arab traders of North Africa for the central regions occupied exclusively by a black population. Nigritia is a name of similar signification and application, invented by geographers.

Booi; III. names are applied is a wide beit lying S. of the Great Desert between Senegambia in the W. and Egypt in the E., and might indeed with propriety be held to include Senegambia itself and Guinea. But, without taking in these, its area is estimated at 631,000 sq. m. and its population at 38,800,000. The geographical regions comprised in Soudan are : \u2014 (1) The upper and mid basins of the Niger. (2) The basin of Lake Tchad, and (3) the almost unknown territory between the basins of Lake Tchad and the AAThite Nile. The mid-course of the Niger runs for the most part over a level plain on the verge of the Great Desert, entering it below Bammakoo and leaving it at Yauri, where it bursts through the line of the Kong Mts. Between the Niger and Lake Tchad the surface is very varied. Lake Tchad is surrounded by an alluvial plain of great extent. East of Lake Tchad are two large oases, \u2014 Waday, about the 22nd meridian, and Fur or Darfur, near Kordofan. The soil of the plains about Lake Tchad and the Niger is very rich : large areas are inundated during the rainy season, and irrigation is generally possible. The culti vated crops consist of maize, millet, cotton, tobacco, yams, melons, Sic. The baobab, butter-tree, and mango-tree are common. The population is a mixed and unsettled one : the aborigines of the Niger basin are negroes, of whom the Songhays are the chief tribe. These still retain a certain degree of independence on the rt. bank of the Niger below Timbuctoo in the district called Aribinda or Gurmah ; but elsewhere they have been subdued by immigrant races, chiefly by the Fellatahs or Foulahs, whom we have already mentioned under the head of Sene gambia, and who have established their sway in Massina, on the Niger above Timbuctoo, in Gando, on the same river, from the 14th parallel to the confluence of the Benuwe, and in Sokoto (the former Houssa territory), in the hilly country between the Niger A'alley and Lake Tchad. These Fellatah kingdoms occupy half the area above assigned to Soudan, and have an aggregate population of 22,300,000. The other immigrant races who have pressed upon the aborigines are the Mandingoes, who hold the kingdom of Bambarra on both sides of the Niger above Massina, and the Touaricks between Timbuctoo and the Fellatah kingdom of Gando. The territory of Borgou, N. of Yoruba, appears to be parcelled out into numerous sovereignties. Surrounding Lake Tchad the most important territories are Bornou on the AV. and S.AV., Bagirmi on the S.E., and Kanem on the E. and N. The above-mentioned Fellatah kingdoms comprise many old territorial divisions, such as Kebbi, lying about the river Sokoto, and now divided between Gando and Sokoto, Nupe or Nyffe on the Niger above the Benuwe, Katseua or Kashna E. of Kebbi, and Adamawa or Fumhina about the head-waters of the Benuwe. The Fellatahs are zealous Mohammedans, and impose their creed on their heathen subjects. An active commerce is carried on throughout Soudan, in which Arabs are much engaged. Towns. \u2014 The towns of Soudan are for the most part commercial entrepots for the extensive caravan trade which prevails through Cen tral Africa. Timbuotoo holds an important position in this respect as being the nearest point to Marocco and Algeria : it stands about 8 m. from the Niger, with which it communicates by a canal, and it is able to exercise a great control over the traffic of the river, whence it has been termed by Barth the \" African Rome ;\" it is now under an inde-"], [509, "493 Chap.

The other towns on the Niger are Sego, the capital of Bambarra ; Jenneh, in Massina ; Gtgo, below Timbuctoo, formerly the capital of the Songhays ; Say, Boussa, Rabba, and Egga, in Gando. The capital of Gando is situated in Kebbi, considerably E. of the Niger. In Sokoto we may notice Kano, the \"London\" of Soudan, an active trading and manufacturing town, on a branch of the Yeou ; Katsena or Kashna, more to the N. ; Wurno, the present capital, on an affluent of the Sokoto ; and Sokoto, the old capital, about 17 m. S.W. of AVurno. We may further notice Kouka, the capital of Bornou ; Masena, the capital of Bagirmi ; Wara, the capital of Waday ; and Cobbe, the capital of Darfur. \u00a7 10. Lower Guinea, &c. \u2014 Lower Guinea is a name applied some what indefinitely to a portion of the western coast of Africa S. ofthe Gulf of Guinea. The section between Capes Lopez and Negro has the best claim to the title, but it is sometimes extended on each side of this to the Bight of Biafra in the N. and to the Tropic in the S. Retaining the more restricted use of the name, we shall add to this section the portion of the coast between C. Negro and the Orange River. The territorial divisions of Lower Guinea from N. to S. are : \u2014 Loango, an independent country between C. Lopez and the river Congo ; Congo and Ambriz, semi-independent countries between the Congo and the Dande, a stream 60 m. N. of the Coanza ; Angola, between the Dande and the Coanza; Benguela or Kimbunda-land, between the Coanza and the Rio de San Francisco ; Dtjimbandi, E. of the Coanza ; and Mossamedes, S. of the Rio de San Francisco. The sovereignty of the whole of this region, with the exception of Loango, is claimed by the Portuguese, and the extent and popula tion of the several districts is given in the subjoined table : \u2014 Natural Features, &c. \u2014 The western range of the African highlands shuts off the maritime districts from the interior, allowing them a varying breadth of from 80 to 150 m. The chief rivers are the Congo or Zaire, already noticed, and the Coanza in Angola. The climate is very hot on the coast, but moderate in the interior : the rainy season occurs between February and April. The soil is fertile, and produces, besides cereals of various kinds, the yam, manioc, banana and other tropical fruits, coffee, gums, &c.

Book III. loped. The Portuguese influence has not been for good. Their set tlements formerly throve on the slave-trade, and since its suppression have decayed and dwindled away. The whole number of Portu guese in Angola hardly exceeds 1000, most of whom are collected in the capital : their trading posts extend inland as far as Cassange in 17\u00b0 49' E. long., but the majority of the traders are half-castes. The chief towns are Loanda, or, more fully, St. Paul de Loanda (12,000), in 8\u00b0 4' S. lat., the Portuguese capital, the seat of a military convict esta blishment, and the chief commercial port on this part of the coast, trading mainly with Brazil in gums, ivory, &c. , Ambriz, a sea-port N.of Loanda; Banza or Salvador, the capital of Congo, in the interior near or amid the mountains ; San Felipe de Benguela, an unhealthy place, the capital of Benguela ; and Mossamedes, 170 m. more S., founded in 1810 and situated in a healthy district.

A more uniformly dreary stretch of eoast does not exist on the face of the globe : the maritime range presses close on the sea, allowing no openings for the escape of the waters of the interior, except in the locality above mentioned. The strip of coast that intervenes between them and the sea is waterless, sandy, utterly barren, and consequently uninhabited. The interior is occupied by native tribes, the northern portion by a tribe named Cimbebas, from whom comes the name of Cimbebasia applied to this region, and the southern portion from about 20\u00b0 S. lat. by various tribes of Hottentots, whence the name of Hottentotia. Of the latter race two great divisions lie N. of the Orange River, viz the Damaras, or"], [511, "Chap. XXII. SOUTH AFRICA. 495 Ovaherero, a pastoral and nomadic people, in the upper valleys of the rivers that disembogue about AV alvisch Bay, and the Namaquas, who occupy the basin of the Fish river, the great northern affluent of the Orange river : other branches of the same race live S. of the Orange River within the limits of the Cape Colony. The Damaras are sup posed to number about 20,000, on an area of 42,500 sq. m. ; and the Namaquas 40,000 on an area of 100,000 sq. m. \u00a7 11. South Africa \u2014 Extent and Natural Features. \u2014 Under the head of South Africa we propose to describe the British colonies in that quarter, and the independent states or peoples with whom the British are brought into contact. The limits of the region in this respect may be placed at the Orange Biver on the W. coast, Delagoa Bay on the E. coast, and the Limpopo River in the interior. It comprises two distinct geographical regions, viz. : a belt of coast-land of varying height, breadth, and character ; and an interior highland connected with the great mass of the continent. The limit between these divisions is distinctly marked on the S. by the Nieuveld and Sneeuw-bergen ranges, which he about the 23rd parallel, and on the E. by the Quatlamba or Drakenberg range and its northern continuations. On the W. the highland gradually approximates to the sea from the extremity of the Nieuveld range, and the maritime region is narrowed at last to a mere strip. From the southerly limits of the highland the surface descends by two terraces to the sea-board; the upper one of which, entitled the Great Karroo, lies between the Nieuveld and the parallel range of tho Zwarte-bergen, aud has a breadth of from 50 to 80 m. and an eleva tion of 3000 ft. ; while the lower one lies between the Zwarte bergen aud the Lange-bergen. These terraces are connected by very steep passes, locally termed \" cloofs.\" The rivers rise for the most part on the maritime slopes, and consequently have short rapid courses and confined basins. An exception must be made in the case of the Orange river, which drains the interior highland, and has an extended basin bounded E. by the Quatlamba and S. by the Nieuveld and Sneeuw-bergen ranges. We add a few particulars as to the natural features of this region. Coast-line. \u2014 The coast-line is regular and, for its extent, deficient in good harbourage. The chief bays and headlands from W. to E. are :\u2014 St. Helena Bay, bounded S. by Cape St. Martin ; Saldanha Bay, a deep inlet, 60 m. N. of Cape Town, giving safe anchorage at all seasons ; Table Bay, backed by Table Mountain, and, with Cape Town on its S. side, much exposed to W. winds and hence unsafe between June and August ; False Bay, enclosed between the Cape of Good Hope on the AV. and False Cape on the E\u201e with an inlet on its W. side named Simon's Bay, 23 m. S. of Cape Town, the resort of vessels during the months that Table Bay is unsafe ; Cape Agulhas, at the S. extremity of the continent ; Algoa Bay, 425 m. E. of the Cape of Good Hope, ex posed to S. winds, but otherwise affording good anchorage; and"], [512, "Book III. 496 SOUTH AFRICA. Delagoa Bay, in about 25\u00b0 50' S. lat., a spacious bay and offering safe anchorage. The chief ports are at Cape Town, where considerable harbour-works have been carried out ; Simon's Bay, which has hitherto been the naval station of South Africa; Mossel Bay; Port Beaufort; the mouth of the Kowie river ; Port Elizabeth, at the W. entrance of Algoa Bay ; East London, at the mouth of the Buffalo river ; and Port Natal, a safe land-locked harbour, but encumbered with a bar. Many of the above ports are improved by harbour-works. Mountains. \u2014 The main ranges have already been noticed. The minor ranges are as follows : \u2014 Roggeveld, a westerly continuation of Nieuveld, which bends roimd towards the N.AV. and separates the head-waters of the rivers Hartebeest and Olifant ; Bokkeveld, a similar continuation of the parallel Swarte-bergen ; Storm-bergen, a southerly continuation of Quatlamba, or rather the southern portion of that range ; Witte bergen, a westerly offset from the point where Quatlamba and Storm bergen meet; Mount Compass (10,250 ft.), the highest summit of the Sneeuw-bergen ; and Table Mountain (3600 ft.), a flat-headed summit at the back of Cape Town. Rivers, \u2014 On the AV. coast \u2014 the Orange, whose course has been already traced : of its tributaries we may notice in its upper section the Caledon from Quatlamba, and, below the junction of the Gariep, the Brak aud the Great Hartebeest, the latter draining a large area enclosed by the Nieuveld and Roggeveld ranges ; tbe Olifant or Elephant river, which drains the westerly portion of the Great Karroo ; and the Berg River, more to the S. On the S. coast \u2014 the Breede, reaching the sea near 21\u00b0 E. long.; the Gauritz, which rises in the N.E. part of the Great Karroo aud, penetrating through the Zwarte range, receives the waters of the lower terrace ; the Gamtoos, which rises in the Sneeuw-bergen ; and the Keiskamma. On the E. coast \u2014 the Great Kei ; the St. John ; and the Tugela. \u00a7 12. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The climate of South Africa is, generally speaking, healthy and adapted to the English con stitution. The variations in so widely extended an area are, of course, very considerable. In Cape Colony, for instance, 3 climatic regions may be distinguished : \u2014 (1) The western coast district from Olifant Biver to the Gauritz, and inland to the S. edge of the Great Karroo. In this, dry weather prevails during the S.E. monsoon between October and March, and rain falls during the N.AV. mon soon : the mean temperature at Cape Town is 61\u00b0 71', and the rain fall 23 inches. The S.E. wind produces the singular phenomenon known as the \" Table-cloth,\" covering the summit of Table Mountain with a white mist, formed by forcing the hot air up the side of the mountain to a colder stratum. (2) The eastern coast district be tween the Gauritz and Kaffraria. In this the S.E. monsoon brings rain, and the N.AV. monsoon dry weather. Thunder-storms are frequent in the summer : the rain-fall amounts to 32 inches at Graham's Town. (3) The interior, which is liable to severe droughts and to extremes of temperature. Snow lies on and about the high ranges during the winter months, as is implied in the names Sneeuw-bergen, \"snowy mountains,\" and AVitte-bergen, \"white"], [513, "Chap. XXII. INHABITANTS. 497 mountains.\" Natal partakes of the same climate as the E. division of Cape Colony, but the rains are yet more copious and the tempera ture higher : on the coast the thermometer ranges between 77\u00b0 and 85\u00b0 in summer, 58\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 in winter : in the interior, at Pieter maritzburg, between 64\u00b0 and 75\u00b0 in summer, 48\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 in winter. The soil of South Africa is in itself fertile, but many portions are barren for want of moisture. This is particularly the case with the Great Karroo which yields an ephemeral herbage after rain, but is at other times barren. European cereals do well in most parts, and maize in the best watered districts. The vine ripens along the coast, and a valuable sweet wine is produced at Constantia near Cape Town. In Natal, tropical plants \u2014 the sugar-cane, arrowroot, indigo, coffee and ginger \u2014 succeed near the coast. Timber is scarce in the AV. and increases gradually towards the E. : the forests are generally found on the seaward. \u00a7 13. Inhabitants. \u2014 The population of South Africa consists of coloured and white races ; the former numerically superior, and occupying some districts conjointly with the whites, and others separately and independently. The coloured races are mostly of native origin, the Malays being the chief exception to this rule. We may notice 4 classes : \u2014 Kafirs, Hottentots, Basutus, and Malays. (1) The Kafirs are a well-built, warlike, and moderately intelligent people, of a dark-brown hue, and much addicted to pastoral pursuits. Under various designations they occupy independently the coast dis tricts on either side of Natal, and are also numerous in the British territories of Natal and the eastern province of Cape Colony. The most promising tribe of Kafirs are the Zulus to the N. of Natal. The Fingoes, who were formerly in subjection to the Kafirs, are a branch of the same stock living under British rule, principally in the E. part of Cape Colony. (2) The Hottentots are ill-favoured and short, with fiat noses, prominent cheek-bones, and black crisp hair; using a language with a peculiar click sound in it ; indolent and dirty, but faithful and honest. They hold the N.W. parts of Cape Colony and are dispersed over the rest of the colony. The Bushmen or Bosjesmans are the lowest specimens of this stock. The Griquas are a mixed race of Dutch and Hottentot extraction, a tall, well-built, and amiable people, of a light-olive hue, averse to settled industry, but active in the chase. They hold a district N. of the Orange River, and are elsewhere scattered over Cape Colony. (3) The Basutus appear to be a mixed race of Bechuanas, Kafirs and Bushmen. (4) The Malays, who are numerous in the towns of Cape Colony, were introduced into Cape Colony by the Dutch from Java. The white population consists of: \u2014 (1) The descendants of the original Dutch settlers, who are still very numerous in Cape Colony and also form independent republics in the regions N. of Orange River. They are termed boers from a word in their own language signifying \"agriculturist,\" and are a slow, plodding, apathetic set. They have retained their ancestral habits, language, and form of religion (Cal vinism) ; and the Dutch legal system still prevails in Cape Colony. (2) The British, who have emigrated within the present century to"], [514, "498 Book III. SOUTH AFRICA. Cape Colony and Natal. (3) Germans, who have been introduced as mercenaries during the Kafir wars, and who are now settled on the E. frontier of Cape Colony in villages under a kind of military tenure. (4) French Protestants, who emigrated after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and are now intermingled with the Dutch. \u00a7 14. Political Divisions \u2014 Historical Geography \u2014 Towns. \u2014 The political divisions of South Africa are : \u2014 (1) Cape Colony, a British colony, which extends from the Orange in the N.W. to the Great Kei on the E. coast. It is divided into 2 provinces, the \"Western with Cape Town for its capital, and the Eastern with Graham's Town for its capital. The northern portions of the country are not occupied by settlers, though nominally included within the limits of the colony : the district about the mid course of the Orange River is designated Great Bushman Land, and that near its mouth, Little Namaqua Land. (2) Natal, also a British colony, on the E. coast, between the rivers Umsilkulu and Tugela, and stretching back inland to the Draken-bergen. (3) KafEraria, or, as it has hitherto been termed, Independent Kaffraria (in contradistinction to the now abolished British Kaffraria), a district held by the Kafirs, on the coast between Cape Colony and Natal. (4) Zulu Land, to the N. of the Tugela, along the coast, another independent Kafir country. (5) The Orange Eiver Free State, an inland territory be tween the Gariep and the Draken-bergen, held by the Dutch. (6) The Trans-vaal Free State, \" beyond the Vasti \" as its name implies, also a Dutch territory, extending over a high and almost unknown region between the sources of the Gariep and the upper course of the Limpopo. (7) Basutu Land, E. of the Caledon branch of the Orange River, a native state placed under British protection in 1868. The areas and populations of these districts are as follow : \u2014 Historical Geography. \u2014 Cape Colony was originally settled by the Dutch2 in or about the year 1652. It was ceded to the British in 1815, having been seized by them in 1795 and 1806, but having been relin quished after the first seizure by the terms of the Peace of Amiens in 1802. The first permanent settlement made in Natal was by English- 2 Tbe name \" Orange \" River contains a reminiscence of their stadtholder, Maurice, of the house of Orange. 1 The area and population of British Kaifraria, which formerly ranked as a separate territory, are included under Cape Colony.

GOVERNMENT, TOWNS, ETC. men at Durban in 1823 : in 1843 the territory was annexed to Cape Colony, and in 1856 was constituted a separate colony. The Orange River and Trans-vaal Free States owe their origin to the dissatisfac tion of the Dutch settlers with British rule, and who consequently emigrated across the southern branch ofthe Orange River in 1835, and attempted to establish their independence between the Orange and Gariep. This step was resisted by the British, and led to the defeat of the boers in 1848, upon which a large body emigrated still further N. and established themselves in the Trans-vaal region. Those who re mained behind in the Orange River district, having proved faithful to the British during the Kafir wars, were rewarded with independence in 1854. Government. \u2014 Cape Colony and Natal have the representative institu tions usual in British colonies. Each is under a governor, in whom the executive is vested, appointed by the Queen and aided by a council. In Cape Colony there are two legislative bodies \u2014 the Legislative Council, of which the chief-justice is president, and the House of Assembly which selects its own president. In Natal there is only a single Legislative House consisting of 4 official and 12 elected members. Commerce. \u2014 The exports of South Africa consist almost entirely of raw produce \u2014 wool, hides, tallow, copper ore, ivory, ostrich feathers, aloes, skins, &o. AVine is almost the only manufactured product exported, and this is reduced to a small amount. Cape Colony has not advanced in prosperity of late years. Natal, on the other hand, appears to be more thriving. Railways. \u2014 Little has as yet been done to provide South Africa with railways. A line has been constructed from Cape Town through Paarl and Stellenbosch to Wellington ; and another from Cape Town to AVynberg. Towns.\u2014 The towns of South Africa are mostly of modern erection and call for little notice. Cape Town (25,199), which ranks as the capital of Cape Colony, is situated on the shores of Table Bay and under Table Mountain : it was founded in 1652, is regularly laid out wdth streets crossing each other at right angles, and contains a cathedral, castle, museum and library, &c. Graham's Town (5432), the capital of the Eastern province, lies about 600 m. E. of Cape Town, at a con siderable elevation (1728 ft. above the sea), and about 25 m. from the coast ; it also has a cathedral and various public buildings. Port Elizabeth (4793) thrives as the chief port of the Eastern province. Graaff-Reinet (3662) is the capital of the interior: it is situated below tht Sneeuw-bergen. AVe may further notice in Cape Colony, Paarl (3800) and Stellenbosch (3926), near Cape Town ; Swellendam, near the river Breede ; Worcester (2072), higher up the basin of the same river ; and King William's Town, the former capital of British Kaffraria. In Natal, the capital, Pietermaritzburg (3500), is situated about 50 m. from the coast; and Durban or Port Natal (1200) is the chief port. AVe need only mention the names of Bloemfontein, the capital of the Orange River Free State ; Potchefstroom, the capital of the Transvaal Free State ; and Zoutpansberg, in the extreme N. of the Transvaal State. \u00a7 15. Sofala, Mozambique, and South-Central Africa. \u2014 Little is known of the coast intervening between Delagoa Bay and C. Delgado, with the exception of the part immediately about the"], [516, "Book III. 500 SOUTH AFRICA. mouth of the Zambesi. It is held by the Portuguese, who have settlements at Inhambane in the territory of Sofala which lies S. of the Zambesi; at Quillimane and Tete, on the Zambesi; and at Mozambique in the territory of the same name N. of the Zambesi. Numerous short rivers reach the sea from the coast range, and a few, as the Zambesi and the Limpopo (which is supposed to be identical with the Ouro of the Sofala coast), come from the interior of the continent. South-Central Africa is divided among various native tribes and kingdoms, of whom we may notice the following : \u2014 The Bechuanas, on the verge of the Kalahari Desert and AV. of the upper Limpopo ; Matebele, S. of Lake Ngami ; the Makololo, on the mid Zambesi ; and Londa, about the upper Zambesi. Kalahari Desert. \u2014 The Kalahari Desert lies N. of the Orange river and extends over 9000 sq. m., with an average elevation of about 3600 ft : rain seldom falls on it, the clouds being intercepted by the ranges that bound it on the E. Its area is enlarging, and even within the last half century springs have dried up and districts become barren on its borders, probably through the want of forests. \u00a7 16. Madagascar. \u2014 Madagascar lies off the eastern coast of South Africa, from which it is separated by the Mozambique Channel, about 240 miles wide. It is situated between 11\u00b0 57' and 25\u00b0 38' S. lat., and 43\u00b0 20\" and 50\u00b0 31' E. long., has a length of about 1030 miles, a breadth of 350, an area of about 232,000 square miles, and a population of from 3 to 5 millions. The most important points on the coast are Cape Amber in the extreme N., and Cape St. Mary in the extreme S. The coast district is flat, low, and unhealthy ; the interior, on the other hand, mountainous and tolerably healthy. The natural resources of the country are very great ; the forests are magnificent : the mountains possess various minerals, gold, silver, copper, lead, iron, and coal, but mining is pro- hibited; silk, indigo, manioc, sugar, tobacco, and rice are largely produced in the cultivated districts ; and domestic animals, cattle, swune, sheep, &c, abound. The inhabitants, generically termed Malagese or Malagasy, belong to various races, the most influential being tho Hovas, who occupy the central district, and are estimated at 750,000; they belong to the Malay stock, and are of an olive colour : the rest are black or brownish-black, and are of African origin. The capacities of the Malagese are, on the whole, good ; they have long practised such arts as smelting, spinning, weaving, and rope-making, and they have exhibited considerable aptitude in acquiring the arts of European civilization. In their domestic relations they are courteous and generous. Christianity is professed by about 5,000. They have no roads, on the supposition that they are thus more safe from invasion. Justice is roughly administered by the intervention of a species of ordeal, named Tangena, in which an accused person is obliged to drink poisoned water. The Hovas are the dominant race, thb form of govern- ment being a monarchy. Clothing and liquors form the chief imports ; oxen and rice the exports. From the AV. coast trade is carried on with Zanzibar by the Arabs. The capital Antananarivo (80,000) is centrally"], [517, "Chap. XXU. 501 MAURITIUS. situated in the interior of the island, while the chief port for European commerce, Tamatave, is on the east coast facing Mauritius. Mada gascar was first made known to the European world by the Portuguese in 1506. Various attempts at colonization have been made by the French, without success, as to the mainland : they have, however, acquired the islands of Ste. Marie off the E. coast and Nossi-Be' off the N.AV. coast. In 1820, English missionaries obtained a footing on the island under the patronage of King Radama. They were expelled by his successor, Queen Ranavolana, in 1835, and the native Christians were exposed to violent persecution. Since her death friendly relations have been again established, and an English embassy has visited the capital. \u00a7 17. Mauritius and the lesser Islands. \u2014 Mauritius, or Isle ofFrance, lies E. of Madagascar in about 57\u00b0 30' E. long. : it derives its first name from the Dutch, who took possession of it in 1598 and so named it in honour of Prince Maurice, and its second name from the French, who held it between 1715-1810, when it was taken by the British and ceded to them in 1814. The island is 36 m. long from N. to S., has an area of 700 sq. m., and a population of 313,462, of whom about 10,000 are Europeans. It is the seat of a colonial government which includes the other insular possessions of Great Britain in these seas, viz. : the Seychelle, Amirante, and Chagos groups ; Rodriguez ; and the distant islands of St. Paul and Amsterdam. The total population of these outlying groups is 9055, the bulk of which belongs to the Seychelles. Mauritius is of volcanic origin, is surrounded by a coral reef, has a very varied surface with mountains rising to 2000 ft. and 3000 ft., a fertile soil producing sugar in great quantities, a moderate climate with a mean temperature of 78\u00b0, and a rainy season between November and April : it is occasionally visited by most violent hurricanes. The capital, Port Louis, stands on the N.AV. coast, and is well fortified. The island constitutes a colony, with a Goveruor, an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council of 18 members, 10 of whom are elective, the rest official. A large trade is carried on with Madagascar, India, and England, and the condition of the colony is prosperous. The Sey chelles are a group of 29 isles intersected by the 56th meridian and the 4th parallel, of granite formation, discovered by the French in 1741, and ceded to England in 1814: their most remarkable product is the coco de mer: the largest island is Mahe, with a town, Port Victoria; population 6000, many of them of French descent ; climate healthy and soil fertile. The Amirante Isles, S.W. of the Seychelles, are a group of 11 low, uninhabited isles, surrounded by coral banks, visited for fishing and catching land-turtles. The Chagos Archipelago, in the centre of the Indian Ocean in 77\u00b0 E. long, of coral formation, is re garded as a dependency of Mauritius, though belonging rather to Asia than to Africa. The island of Diego Garcia may be considered as a member of this group, though lying apart to the S. of it. The Comoro Isles, at the N. entrance of the Mozambique Channel, and 2>i0 m. from tbe coast of Africa, form a group of 4, named Comoro, Mohilla, Johanna, and Mayotta, of volcanic formation, mountainous aud fertile, occupied by negroes and Arabs, and governed by independent sultanB, with the"], [518, "Book III. 502 SOUTH AFRICA. exception of Mayotta, which was ceded to the French in 1846, by whom a naval depot has been planted on the adjacent islet of Zaondzi. Sugar and coffee are the staple products of the Comoro Isles. Rodriguez, 330 m. N.E. of Mauritius, is a mountainous islet with a good harbour. Bourbon or Reunion, S.AV. of Mauritius, is of an oval shape, 38 m. long by 28 m. broad, of volcanic origin, most of the craters being extinct, but one of them, Piton de Fournaise, still remarkably active, the climate formerly healthy, now very much the reverse as far as Europeans are concerned, the soil arid with the exception of the region immediately adjacent to the sea, the population containing an admixture of Indians, Chinese, negroes, and about 2000 French. St. Paul's and Amsterdam are remote isles, the former in 38\u00b0 43 S. lat., 77\u00b0 38' E. long., the latter about 60 m. to the N., lying nearly in the line of the route between the Cape and Australia, both of volcanic origin ; St. Paul's deficient in wood and water,, and Amsterdam in harbourage. Of the less important isles in the seas surrounding Africa we may notice : \u2014 (1 ) In the Indian Ocean. \u2014 Socotra, 150 m. E. of Cape Guardafui, 70 m. long from E. to AV., with a dorsal range of granite mountains in that direction, occupied by a mixed population of Arabs and negroes, and politically subject to the Sultan of Keshin in Arabia.

ISLANDS. 503 to Australia, the property of Great Britain, and occupied by a mixed European population of 85 persons. St. Helena, a small island with a circumference of 28 m., an area of 30,300 acres, and a population (iu 1851) of about 5500, of whom one-third are Europeans. It is situated in 15\u00b0 55' S. lat., 5\u00b0 44' AV. long , 1200 m. from the AV. coast of Africa, 1800 from S. America, and in the homeward track of vessels from India. It is of volcanic origin, the central height, Diana's Peak, rising to 269:3 ft., and consists of a table-land, terminating in steep cliffs on the very edge of the sea, and accessible by steep ravines or gulleys. The climate is healthy, water abundant, and the soil fertile. James-Town on the N.AV. side of the island is the only port. The island was discovered in 1502 by the Portuguese, and was afterwards occupied by the Dutch, from whom it passed to the English in 1673. It is valuable as a naval station, but derives its chief notoriety from its having been the place where Napoleon Buonaparte spent the last years of his life, between 1815-21, in exile. His residence, Longwood, is on the central table land. Ascension, 800 m. N.AV. of St. Helena, in about 7\u00b0 56' S. lat., 14\u00b0 25' AV. long., with an area of only 35 sq. m., and a population of 400, of volcanic origin with a peak 2870 ft. high, useful as a depot for provisioning ships, but otherwise only noted for its turtle and birds' eggs. It was discovered in 1501 on Ascension-day, and occupied by the English in 1815. The Cape Verd Islands, a group of 14, lying 320 m. AV. of the cape after which they are named, with an aggregate area of 1650 sq. m. and a population of 89,310, nearly half of which is concentrated on Santiago, the largest of the group. The islan/ls are mountainous, the volcanic peak of Fogo rising 9157 ft., the climate hot, the soil fertile, but water deficient; the productions coffee, maize, cotton, and tropical fruits. The chief town is Porto Praya on Santiago. The islands belong to Portugal.

Its extreme breadth does not much exceed 3000 miles, and this is attained only at two points, viz., in North America under the 45th parallel, from the peninsula of Nova Scotia in the E. to the mouth of the Columbia river in the W., and in South America under the 5th parallel S. lat. : southwards of these limits each rapidly tapers off to a point, reducing the average breadth to little more than half the amount above stated. The most easterly point of America is near Parahiba in Brazil, 34\u00b0 55' W. long., and the most westerly, Cape Prince of AVales on Behring Strait in 167\u00b0 30' AV. long. The above limits do not include those islands which lie so closely adjacent to the mainland as to become practically portions of it. If we add to North America the large group which fringes its N. coast, together with Greenland, which is apparently a member of that group ; and if again we add to South America the group of which Tierra del Fuego is the principal member, the length of the continent will be considerably increased, and its easterly limit carried on to 30\u00b0 AV. long. The area of America (islands included) is estimated at 15,813,592 sq. m., and its population at 74,479,000. History of Discovery. \u2014 North America had been discovered by the Norwegians of Iceland some five centuries before the expeditions of Columbus and Cabot. In 986 some of these adventurers settled in Greenland, and thence in 994\u20141007 made a series of expeditions south wards to the mainland of America, discovering localities which they named Markland (Nova Scotiai, Helluland (Newfoundland), Vinland (Rhode Island), Kjalarnes iCape Codi, and Hopsvata (Mount Hope). The fame of these voyages did not, however, reach Southern Europe, and America remained a terra incognita, until the latter part of the 15th cent., when the search after a westerly route to India and China led to its accidental discovery. The Genoese navigator, Columbus, was the pioneer in this great undertaking, and, though not the first to set foot on the mainland, he was the true discoverer of America. He made altogether four voyages in that direction, iu the first of which he dis covered one of the Bahamas, probably AVatling Isle (Oct. 12, 1492), and then Cuba and Hayti; in the second (1493-4), Dominica, Gua daloupe, and Jamaica; in the third (1498), Trinidad, and the main land of South America opposite that island ; while in the fourth (1502), he traced the coast from Honduras to the Gulf of Darien. Meanwhile the Cabots, sailing from Bristol under the patronage of Henry VII., had reached the mainland of North America (probably Labrador) in 1497, thus anticipating Columbus in the discovery of the mainland; and in the following year (1498) Sebastian Cabot discovered Newfoundland (his Prima Vista). Columbus designated his new dis coveries the 'West Indies,' under the impression that they were con nected with the Indies which were the object of his voyage. The name ' America ' owes its origin to Amerigo Vespucci, a Florentine, who accompanied the Spanish navigator Ojeda to the coast of Vene zuela in 1499, and made three subsequent expeditions between that year and 1504. Accounts of bis voyages were published, and in one of MOD. GEO. z"], [522, "AMERICA. Book IV. 506 these (printed at St. DiS in Lorraine in 1507 without his supervision) his first voyage is erroneously assigned to the year 1497, which would nave been before Columbus reached the mainland. The name Terra America was hence given to the country and gradually extended over the whole continent. The subsequent exploration of the continent has continued from the time of Columbus to the present century, and it is only within the last few years that the outline of the\"N. coast has been completed. In 1500 Cabral accidentally reached Brazil about the mouth of the Amazons. In 1501 Bastidas surveyed the coast of New Granada. Yucatan was discovered by de Solis and Pinzon in 1508, and Florida by Ponce de Leon in 1512. Balboa sighted the Pacific from the mountains of Panama in 1513. De Solis reached the Rio de la Plata in 1515, and in 1520 Magelhaens entered the Pacific by the strait named after him. Turning to North America we have to note the discovery of the St. Lawrence by Aubert in 1508, and its explora tion as high as Montreal by Jacques Cartier in 1534; the voyages of Frobisher in 1576-8 along the coasts of Greeuland and Labrador; the discovery of Davis Strait in 1585, of Hudson Bay in 1610, and of Baffin Bay in 1615, by the enterprising English navigators after whom they are named. On the AV. coast, Lower California was discovered by Xinienes, the pilot of Mendoza, in 1534 ; the Gulf of California by Ulloa in 1 539 ; Upper California as high as 44\u00b0 N. lat. by Cabrillo in 1542 ; and, lastly, Behring Strait by the Russian navigator of that name in 1741. The survey of the N. coast has been the special work of British enterprise : hi this quarter we have first to notice the overland expeditions of Hearne in 1772 and Mackenzie in 1793 to the northern seaboard ; Hearne by way of the Coppermine river, the other by the Mackenzie river. In 1819 Parry penetrated through Lancaster Sound to Melville Island, discovering in his way Prince Regent Inlet and Wellington Channel, and sighting Banks' Land, AV. of Melville Island. In 1829-33 Sir John Ross discovered Boothia Felix, and his nephew Sir James Ross explored Bellot Strait and crossed Boothia to the strait which he named after himself. Meanwhile, Franklin had, in 1821, reached the coast at the mouth of the Coppermine river, and had explored it to Coronation Gulf; and in his second journey in 1825 he followed the coast westward from the Mackenzie river to nearly 149\u00b0 W. long., while his colleague Richardson, taking the opposite direction, explored the coast to the mouth of the Coppermine and discovered AVollaston Land. In 1834 Back descended the river named after him to the sea ; in 1836 Dease and Simpson completed the survey of the coast between 149\u00b0 W. long, and Sir John Barrow Cape, which had been previously reached in 1825 ; and in 1837-8, they traced the coast between Coro nation Gulf aud Back river, and E. of that river as far as 92\u00b0 Vf. long. In 1845 Franklin undertook his last fatal expedition, which led indirectly to the discovery (a barren one as yet, and likely to remain such) of the North- AVest passage by Maclure in 1850, and to the exami nation of the upper part of Smith Sound and its northerly extension, Kennedy Channel. The furthest point reached in this direction, and indeed in any direction on land, lies in 81\u00b0 35' on Grinnell Land, which was visited by the American explorer Hayes in 1861. The sea-route by Smith Sound has been followed up to 79\u00b0 N. lat. \u00a7 2. Characteristic Features. \u2014 The characteristic features of America, as compared with the other continents, are :\u2014 (1) Uni formity of figure \u2014 the two great divisions each bearing a resemblance"], [523, "Chai\\ XXIII. CONTINENTAL DIVISIONS. 507 to a triangle with the apex pointing southwards. (2) Regularity of coast-line\u2014 the west coast possessing no indentation of importance except the Gulf of California, and the east being also comparatively regular, though it is broken by the intrusion of Hudson Bay in the N., and by the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea in the centre, the only other inlets worthy of notice in North America being the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Bay of Fundy, and Chesa peake Bay; and in South America, the estuary of the Eio de la Plata, and the Gulfs of St. Matias and St. George. (3) Longi tudinal extension \u2014 its length being from N. to S., while in the Old World the extension is from E. to W. (4) Regularity of mountain system\u2014 a connected series of mountain-chains skirting the western coast from the extreme N. to the extreme S., and forming the back bone of the whole continent, while less important chains protrude towards the E. coast in both divisions. (5) Extent of cultivable plains\u2014 us compared with the high and desolate plateaus of Asia the deserts of Africa, and the varied surface of Europe. (6) Length of river-courses, and vast areas of river-basins. \u00a7 3. Continental Divisions. \u2014 America consists of two large masses of land, so nearly balanced in size that the smaller cannot be regarded as an appendage of the larger, and so slightly connected with each other by an isthmus that, practically speaking, they are distinct continents. They are distinguished from their position as North America and South America, while the neck of land which serves as the connecting link between them is named Central America. Between the two continents is interposed a large inlet of the Atlantic, which may collectively be termed the \" Mediter- ranean \" of America, and which is divided into two portions by the approximation of the peninsula of Yucatan to the isle of Cuba. The northern division is the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 a semi-inclosed, oval-shaped, comparatively shallow sheet of water with an area of 700,000 sq. m. : the southern division is the Caribbean Sea \u2014 of irregular shape, profoundly deep, and with an area of 1,250,000 sq. m. : the two are connected by the Strait of Yucatan. The geographical divi- sions above noticed do not impair the real unity of the continent, which rests on higher grounds than the mere continuity of the land. The structure of the two divisions is alike \u2014 the Bocky Mts. in the N. answering to the Andes in the S., and the two together forming a single spinal chord, with its slope towards the E. and its counter- slope towards the Pacific Ocean. The native population of the two divisions is in the main also alike \u2014 exhibiting affinities both of phy siology and of language-structure sufficient to warrant their being classed together. And, lastly, the fauna and flora have points of general resemblance in the two divisions \u2014 each having the same prodigality of vegetable life, magnificent forests and wide expanses z 2"], [524, "508 NORTH AMERICA. Book IV. of pasture-land, and the same inferiority, as compared with the Old World in the size and character of its animals. II. North A&ierica. \u00a7 4. Extent \u2014 Area and Population \u2014 Seas, Gulfs and Pro montories. \u2014 The boundaries of North America have been already described in general terms in \u00a7 1 of this chapter : it only remains to say that its S. boundary on the mainland coincides with the S. boundary of Mexico which crosses from the Pacific in 15\u00b0 N. lat. to the Gulf of Mexico in 18\u00b0 N. lat. The West Indian Archipelago is generally included in this division, as well as the Arctic Archipelago. In shape North America approaches to a right-angled triangle, the hypothenuse of which is formed by a line drawn from its most southerly point to Prince of AVales Cape in the N.W., the apex of the right angle being at C. Charles in Labrador, 55\u00b0 30' W. long. The area (islands included) amounts to 8,661,867 sq. m. and the population to 47,685,200. Pronunciation of Names. \u2014 Indian names are generally accented on the penultimate, as Ohio, Potomac, &c. The name Wyoming is no exception to this rule, in spite of Campbell's accentuation of it in his poem ' Gertrude of Wyoming.' The pronunciation of Niagara has become authorized by usage ; but the Indian style is Niagara, as given in Goldsmith's ' Traveller : ' \u2014 \" And Niagara stuns with thund'riog sound.'' Some names are pronounced somewhat singularly, as Chicago, She kaw-go; Mackinac, Mackinau, &c. The French pronunciation has been imperfectly followed in the names Illinois, Illinoi, Sault, Soo, St. Marie, &c. The well-known term Yankee is probably an Indian attempt to pronounce the French Anglais. Seas, Gulfs and Capes. \u2014 The inclosed seas of North America are comparatively few. The most important is Hudson Bay, which occu pies an area of about 300,000 sq. m. and is connected with the Atlantic by Hudson Strait and Davis Strait : its commercial value is small, inas much as it is ice-bound for 8 months in the year and is surrounded by a barren region : its shores are generally high and rocky, and it has a considerable protuberance, called James Bay, at its S. extremity. Baffin Bay is a wide arm of the sea enclosed between the mainland and Green land, connected S. with the Atlantic through Davis Strait, and N. with the Arctic Ocean through Smith Sound, Lancaster Sound, and other channels : it is much visited by whalers during the short season that the navigation is open. The Gulf of St. Lawrence penetrates deeply between Labrador and Nova Scotia up to the estuary of the river St. Lawrence, and is considerably enclosed on the side of the ocean by the islands of Newfoundland and Cape Breton, between which lies the most open passage into it, the other channels being the Strait of Belle- Isle between Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Gut of Canso be tween Cape Breton and Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia itself is a peninsula of peculiar form, having its length parallel to the mainland : the Bay of Fundy runs up between the peninsula and the mainland, forking off at its upper extremity into two long arms, Chignecto Bay and Menes"], [525, "509 Chap. XXIII. SEAS, GULFS, AND CAPES. Basin. The only other noticeable openings on the Atlantic coast are Delaware Bay, the estuary of the river Delaware, and Chesapeake Bay, a long and peculiarly indented inlet, the receptacle ofthe Susquehanna and other rivers which it intercepts in their passage to the ocean. The Strait of Florida, between Florida and the Bahamas, gives access to the Gulf of Mexico from the N. On the Pacific eoast we have to notice the long and tapering Gulf of California, running up 700 m. INDEX. Lakes. Mount aih s. p. Winnipeg-cos. h. Deer Lake. i Wollaslon. j Athabasca. h.

Book IV. between the mainland and a peninsula equally long and tapering, the gulf being 1 20 m. wide at its entrance and the peninsula 105 m. : ita waters are but little frequented by shipping. The coast about Behring Strait is very irregular, the most noticeable features being the penin sula of Alaska with its chain of volcanic mountains, and the indenta tions occupied by Bristol Bay, Norton Sound, and Kotzebue Sound. The most prominent capes on the continent and its adjacent islands are C. Farewell on Greenland, C. Race on Newfoundland, C. Sable, the S. point of Nova Scotia, a second C. Sable in Florida, C. St. Lucas at the extremity of the Californian peninsula, and C. Prince of Wales on Behring Strait. \u00a7 5. Configuration \u2014 Mountains and Plains. \u2014 The most im portant feature in the surface of North America is the belt of high land which stretches throughout its whole length in proximity to the western coast, forming the primary watershed of the continent. This highland attains its greatest width about the 40th parallel, where it extends over the whole interval between the Sierra Nevada in the W. and the Eocky Mts. in the E., a distance of about 800 m. From this part it gradually contracts in both directions, resolving itself N. into a series of parallel ranges which decline towards the Arctic Ocean, and S. into an elevated table-land which occupies nearly the whole space between the Mexican Gulf and the Pacific. The whole of this highland may be described as the \" Eocky Mountain System,\" in an extended use of that term. But in its proper sense the Eocky Mts. are the chain, or rather the series of chains, which form the eastern buttress of the highland from about the 36th parallel northward. The western buttress is formed by the Sierra Nevada between the 35th and 42nd parallels, and the Cascade Bange be tween the 42nd and 55th parallels, beyond which the line of heights approaches close to the coast and contains a series of very lofty summits, such as Mt. St. Elias, Mt. Fairweather, and others. We reserve a closer description of the Eocky Mts. themselves for future paragraphs, and proceed to trace the course of the highland from the southern termination of the chain. The line forks off at the head of the Eio Grande del Norte about the 38th parallel, and is continued on each side of that river to the 30th parallel ; the western line, which forms the watershed and is therefore regarded as the pri mary range, is termed generally the Sierra Madre, and in its several parts Sierra de San Juan (37\u00b0 N. lat.), Sierra Mimbres (34\u00b0 N. lat.), and Sierra Verde (30\u00b0 N. lat.) ; the eastern line is named Sierra Guadalupe or the Anahuao Mts. From the 30th parallel a lofty table-land occu pies the region W. of the Eio Grande : its designations are somewhat undefined, but it may be conveniently divided into two sections \u2014 the Chihuahua Plateau on each side of the town of that name to the 25th parallel in the S., and the Anahuao Plateau from the 25th parallel to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The only other mountain system"], [527, "Chap. XXIII. MOUNTAINS, ETC. \u2014 HYDROGRAPHY. 511 of continental importance in North America is the Appalachian or Alleghany, which holds the same relation to the Atlantic Ocean that the Eocky Mt. system does to the Pacific, but on a much smaller scale in length, breadth, and height. It rises S. about 34\u00b0 30\" N lat. at a distance of 300 m. from the coast, and continues to the St. Lawrence opposite to Montreal, and in an extended sense to the shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, converging towards the coast as it proceeds N. until it nearly fills the interval between the sea and the St. Lawrence valley. N. of the St. Lawrence the large peninsula between Hudson Bay and the Atlantic is occupied by the Labrador Plateau. From the E. base of the Eocky Mts. a vast expanse of plain, more or less elevated, stretches away N.E. to the Arctic Ocean and Hudson Bay, and S.E. to the Mexican Gulf and the Alleghany Mts. Between the Alleghany and the Eocky Mts. the great river-basin of the Mississippi-Missouri extends from about the 48th parallel to the Mexican Gulf, and N. of this the plain lies open without interruption to the Arctic Ocean, the two divisions together forming a single great valley stretching from sea to sea through the length of the continent. Our review of the configura tion of the continent will be completed by noticing the Coast Eange which closely skirts the Pacific coast in California. \u00a7 6. Hydrography. \u2014 North America is highly favoured in respect to its water-ways : the rivers are large, numerous, and admirably dis tributed, with an ample development of branches, and a close approx imation to each other at their head-waters. Note, for instance, the proximity of the head-waters of the Colorado, the Snake Eiver or South Fork of the Columbia, the Wind Eiver branch of the Mis souri, and the Sweet- Water branch of the North Platte, flowing in different directions from the Eocky Mts. about the 43rd parallel. Still more, note the convergence of the lines of the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence with its lake system, together forming a water way through the heart of the continent, interrupted only by a brief interval of plain which has been crossed by canals at various points. The line of the Eocky Mts. forms the primary watershed of the continent. Towards the W. the waters seek the Pacific, those only excepted which gather in the Great Basin of Utah. The direct distance between the mountains and the sea on this side is short, but the rivers gain additional length by following the longitudinal valleys of the interior, as instanced most notably in the Colorado, which joins the Gulf of California, and, in a less marked degree, in the other great rivers of this slope \u2014 the Columbia and the Frazer. Towards the E. the Eocky Mts. descend with a long slope to the great plain : and on this side the rivers, having reached the plain, are distributed by its gentle slopes, partly to the Gulf of Mexico, as in the case of the various branches of the Missouri and the other"], [528, "512 NORTH AMERICA. Book IV. great westerly feeders of the Mississippi \u2014 the Arkansas and the Bed Biver ; partly to Hudson Bay, through the Saskatchewan ; and partly to the Arctic Ocean through the numerous branches of the Mac kenzie. Towards the S. extremity of the range the Eio Grande del Norte follows the longitudinal direction of the range and reaches the maritime plain of the Gulf of Mexico through a break in the Guada lupe range. The Mississippi, whose basin ooeupies the interval between the Eocky Mts. and the Alleghanies, is mainly formed of 3 great bratiebes, viz. : the Missouri, already noticed as coming from the Eocky Mts. ; the Mississippi, which rises on the plain itself at the head of the southerly slope ; and the Ohio, which with the Ten nessee drains the western slope of the Appalachian Mts. and the district intermediate between them and the trunk stream. The southerly slope of the plain commences W. of Lake Superior, and is not bounded by any defined line of elevation : here is a neutral territory on which the basins of the Eed Eiver which flows N. to Lake Winnipeg, of the Mississippi which flows S. to the Gulf of Mexico, and of tbe St. Lawrence which flows E. to the Atlantic, meet or rather intermingle. To the N. and E. of this point are found lake-systems on a vast scale, which feed, and in some cases originate, mighty rivers. The eastern system is the most important, and consists of a magnificent group of 5 lakes \u2014 Superior, Michigan, Huron, Rrie, and Ontario \u2014 which have a common outlet to the Atlantic through the St. Lawrence. The northern system is more extensive and complicated, but less valuable : it may be divided into two sections, one of which has its outlet to Hudson Bay through the Nelson River, the other to the Arctic Ocean through the Mackenzie, while between these two there is a smaller group which it is difficult to assign to either exclusively, as it is connected both with the Deer Eiver branch of the Churchill, which flows to Hudson Bay, and with the Stone Eiver branch of the Mackenzie. The first group comprises Winnipeg, the receptacle of the Saskatchewan and the Eed Eiver, Winnipegos, Manitoba, Lake of the Woods, &c. ; the second or Arctic Sea group, Athabasca, Great Slave, and Great Bear ; and the third or intermediate group, Wollaston, Deer, and other lesser lakes. Indeed so closely do the several hydrographical regions press upon one another that portages alone separate the waters fall ing into Lake Superior from those that seek Hudson Bay, and these from others that seek the Arctic Ocean.

The northerly winds are rendered abnormally severe by the vast accu-' mulations of ice in the land-locked channels about the north coast ; the southerly winds sweep up from the Tropics and across the Gulf of Mexico. A warm oceanic current (the southerly bend of the Japan current) laves the W. coast, and a cold Arctic current inter poses between the E. coast and the Gulf Stream. Hence the temperature of North America differs widely in the same latitudes : the western maritime region is comparatively warm and equable, with an abundant rainfall in its northern section, and a moderate one to the S. of the 40th parallel : the eastern maritime region has an excess of cold at all seasons except summer, when it has an excess of heat as compared with the west coast ; rain is here abun dant, and increases in amount from N. to S. The difference between the temperatures of the E. and W. coasts is estimated at 15\u00b0 or 20\u00b0. In the interior the range of the thermometer is still greater than on the E. coast: on the highlands the cold is intense and the isothermal lines there descend far to the S. from each side. The drought is also'great, the annual rainfall at Utah being estimated at only 5 inches. The high prairies on the E. of the Bocky Mts. are dry and liable to extremes of temperature. The winters in Canada and the whole northern region are severe, and the summers of the low lying districts about the Gulf of Mexico are very hot. Violent storms occur on the prairies, particularly in Texas, where they are known as \" Northerns \" from their direction. The \" Indian summer \" of Canada and the Northern United States is a brief spell of charming weather just before the fall of the first snow. The following examples of temperature and rainfall illustrate the above statements : \u2014 \u00a7 8. Soil and Vegetation. \u2014 The amount of productive soil in North America is small as compared with the area of the continent. We may strike out as hopelessly barren all that lies N. of a line drawn diagonally from the mouth of the St. Lawrence in the E. to Sitka Isle in the W., passing somewhat N. of Lake Winnipeg . and even S. of that line there are large tracts that are little better, such as the high western prairies, and portions of the highlands between the Bocky Mts. and the Pacific.

SOIL AND VEGETATION. 515 are regions of surpassing fertility about the Canadian Lakes, in the Mississippi basin, along the Appalachian slopes, around the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, and in the valleys of the Pacific coast ; and large areas N. of the Mississippi about lake Winnipeg and the Saskatchewan also appear to be cultivable. The vegetation of North America is remarkably luxuriant\u2014 the forests of vast extent, the individual trees of magnificent growth, occasionally attaining in the Pacific region to a height of 300 ft., and the varieties of trees very numerous, there being as many as 26 kinds of oak, 18 kinds of walnut, and others in equal variety. The trees most charac teristic of North America are \u2014 the sugar-maple, which grows as high N. as Canada ; the tulip-tree, which attains magnificent dimensions ; the hickory ; the buck-eye ; the Canadian poplar, which grows on the W. side of the Alleghanies as well as in Canada ; the magnolia of the Southern States ; tbe cypresses of the swamps in tbe same part; the gigantic Wellingtonia, sugar-pine (pinus Lambertiana), and redwood, trees peculiar to the slopes facing the Pacific in Cali fornia and Oregon ; and the cactuses of Mexico. The grasses are numerous. North America is naturally deficient in bread-plants ; maize may perhaps be indigenous to Mexico, but it also belongs to S. America, whence the potato was certainly introduced. The other cereals, together with plants of commercial value, such as tobacco, cotton, flax, and hemp, are all importations from the Old World.

The species are few and of inferior quality, but the individuals in the several species are very numerous. The deserts"], [532, "516 NORTH AMERICA. Book IV. in the N. and centre os North America are still tenanted hy vast numbers of wild animals. Among these the buffalo holds a prominent place from the astonishing size of the herds on the western prairies, where it feeds on a grass (the sesteria dacty loides) specially adapted to its nurture. The elk is also found on these prairies and in the highlands, but in fewer numbers. The Great Beaver Dam, Grass Late. grizzly bear infests the Eocky Mountains ; the black bear is more widely spread over the whole continent, and the white bear is common in the Arctic region. The Canada lynx, the American panther, and tho ocelot of Mexico may be further specified. Wolves are found throughout the whole length of the continent. The rein-deer is the most valuable animal in the extreme north. The beaver, black squirrel, sable, and marten, are among the fur bearing animals of the Hudson Bay Territory. The Virginian opossum frequents Virginia and Louisiana ; and the racoon the warmer regions. Alligators infest the southern rivers, and snakes of all kinds the forests and prairies. The cochineal is one of the most valuable products of Mexico. The turkey is the only domesticated animal which North America has contributed to the Old World. \u00a7 10. Minerals. \u2014 The mineral resources of North America are varied, valuable, and apparently inexhaustible. The Eocky Mountain system is metalliferous probably throughout its whole length, though it has not been fully explored beyond 55\u00b0 N. lat. ; to the S. of this the greater part of it is auriferous, besides con taining stores of silver, copper, iron, lead, and quicksilver. The"], [533, "Chap. XXIII. ETHNOLOGY \u2014 POLITICAL DIVISIONS. 517 mineral deposits are found on both sides of the highland \u2014 in the Eocky Mts. proper, and in the Nevada and Cascade ranges; and in Mexico more especially on the side of the Pacific. A second mineral region follows the line of the Appalachian system : this is also auri ferous in its southern section, but its yield is so far below that of the Pacific region that it is now neglected : iron is abundant and a valuable bed of coal extends along it from Pennsylvania to Alabama. The plain of the Mississippi has minerals in various parts \u2014 coal-fields about the upper course of the river itself in the States of Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa, and again about its tributary the Ohio ; iron in various parts, but most remarkably in the Iron- Mountain and Pilot Knob of Missouri ; and lead on both sides of the Upper Mississippi in Iowa and Wisconsin. The Lake region is famed for the copper found about Lake Superior, from which a consider able amount of silver is extracted. Coal is again found about the Saskatchewan, and in a few spots on the side of the Pacific, particularly in Vancouver Isle. The coal-fields of North America have been esti mated at 204,182 sq. m., and probably far exceed that amount. \u00a7 11. Ethnology. \u2014 The population of North America falls into two divisions \u2014 native and immigrant. Of the latter we shall speak hereafter, in describing the individual countries. The native, to which the title of \" Indians \" has adhered since the days of Colum bus, is gradually dying out in the central regions under the advance of the whites. The constant inclosure of the hunting-grounds, the successive removals of the tribes more to the W., the introduction of ardent spirits and European diseases, and the natural aversion of the race to industry and settled habits\u2014 these are the chief causes of its gradual decline. A few tribes, indeed, as the Cherokees, Creeks, and Choctaws, have adopted civilized habits and follow agricultural pursuits in the territory assigned to them beyond the Mississippi. But the majority lead a wandering life in the western prairies and in the mountains, gaining a precarious livelihood from the chase, and plundering the emigrants who fall into their clutches : in this class are the savage Comanches and Apachees of Texas and New Mexico. Of a lower grade are the Snake Indians of Utah, who live on roots and grubs : and still lower yet the Chenooks of Nootka Sound, and the generality of the North-western tribes. The Indians of the Hudson Bay Territory have fared better than those of other parts, inasmuch as their services as hunters are needed by the lords of the soil. The Esquimaux of the extreme north are secured in their settlements by the terrible severity of the climate : and at the other extremity of the continent, in Mexico, the Indians have mingled with the whites, and are an influential element in the population. The Red Indians are generally supposed to belong to the Mongol stock, and to have reached America across Behring Strait. Through out the whole length of the continent they have retrograded in the"], [534, "518 BRITISH NORTH AMERICA. Book IV. arts of civilization ; Mexico abounds with monuments which tell of the high culture of the Tolteks, who held that country between the 7th and llth cents., and of their successors, the Azteks, who were thoroughly civilized and wealthy at the time of the Spanish conquest under Cortez. Whence these, and particularly the Tolteks, .attained their culture, is a mystery. In other parts there are no evidences of an equal degree of culture ; yet tokens are not wanting of a higher stage of civilization than that of the modern Red Indian, such as the tumuli about the rivers Ohio and Mississippi, the roads of Florida, intrenched camps, the pueblos of New Mexico, and the various ornaments, idol-images, and vessels of pottery found in the old burial-places. \u00a7 12. Political Divisions. \u2014 The mainland of North America is divided between (1) the British Colonies ; (2) the United States ; and (3) Mexico. Other nations have a footing on the adjacent islands \u2014 Spain, France, Sweden, Holland, and Denmark in the West Indies, the last-mentioned also in Greenland, and France on the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, off Newfoundland. Tne British colonies and the United States are about equal in point of area, but the latter are far superior in population. The com ponent parts of these two divisions are in certain respects independent of each other. III. British North America. \u00a7 13.

DOMINION OF CANADA. Historical Geography.\u2014 The earliest European settlements in Canada were made by the French, to whom is due the praise of having explored the whole course of the St. Lawrence and the region of the Great Lakes to the head of the Mississippi. In 1 542 they settled at Hochelaga, the present Montreal; in 1608 they founded Quebec, and subsequently they spread over the whole of what they called \" New France,\" including Nova Scotia, to which they gave the name of Acadia, Cape Breton, and Newfoundland. Wars were frequent between the English and French from 1690 to 1760. In 1758, Nova Scotia and Cape Breton were conquered by the British. In 1759 the capture of Quebec secured to the English the supremacy in these parts : and by the treaty of Paris in 1763 France renounced all claim to her northern possessions. On the western side of the Rocky Mts., the coast district N. of California was claimed both by Great Britain and the United States. When the tide of emigration set in this direction it was found necessary to adjust the boundary, which was effected in 1846 by fixing it at 49\u00b0 N. lat. ; but a question is still pending between the governments as to whether the strait intervening between the mainland and Vancouver Island, in which lies the isle of St. Juan, belongs wholly to Great Britain or not. \u00a7 14. The Dominion of Canada \u2014 Its Area and Population \u2014 Coast-line and Harbours. \u2014 The Dominion of Canada occupies nearly the whole basin of the St. Lawrence from the head of Lake Superior to the Atlantic Ocean. The chain of the Great Lakes separates it from the United States in the south-west, and the St. Lawrence forms the boundary from Lake Ontario to the 75 th meridian ; eastward of which Canada possesses both banks of the river to the sea. In the N. its boundary may be placed at the line of high ground which forms the watershed between the St. Lawrence basin and Hudson Bay. It contains the following pro vinces : \u2014 Quebec (otherwise known as East or Lower Canada), on both sides of the St. Lawrence below the river Ottawa ; Ontario (West or Upper Canada), along the 1. bank of the St. Lawrence above the Ottawa, and about the Great Lakes ; New Brunswick, on the coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Bay of Fundy, from Chaleur Bay in the N. to Passamaquoddy Bay in the S., and inland to about the 68th meridian, where it adjoins the State of Maine ; and Nova Scotia, on the peninsula S. of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with the isle of Cape Breton stretching away N.E. from its eastern ex tremity. The two first may be classed together as the Upper Provinces and the two last as the Maritime Provinces. The four were united in a single Confederation in 1867, previously to which the Upper Provinces alone were united. The areas and populations of these provinces are as follow : \u2014"], [536, "520 DOMINION OF CANADA. Book IV. Ccast-line and harbours. \u2014 The Dominion of Canada possesses an extended coast-line on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Bay of Fundy, and the Atlantic Ocean. The Gulf of St. Lawrence has a succession of bays and inlets, which, though unserviceable during the winter season from ice, afford fine harbourage at other times. The chief of these bays are \u2014 Gaspe, just below the estuary of the St. Lawrence ; Chaleur, 90 m. long, the receptacle of the river Ristigouche ; Miramichi, with a couple of islands to guard its entrance; and St. George's Bay, at tbe W. entrance of the Gut of Canso. The S. coast of Nova Scotia is fretted with a succession of bays and coves, with islands fronting them : the largest are Margaret's and Mahone Bays, but in point of commercial value these are far surpassed by Halifax Bay ; in addition to which there are 11 others capable of receiving ships of the line. The S.W. coast of New Brunswick on the Bay of Fundy is irregular and contains Passamaquoddy Bay on the United States' frontier. The leading har bours on the sea-board are Halifax, in Nova Scotia, a noble and well protected basin, or rather double basin, the inner one of which, the Bedford Basin, has an area of 10 sq. ni. : it is never frozen up, and is only 8 days distant from England by steam ; St. John, in New Brunswick, at the mouth of the river of the same name ; St. Andrews, on Passamaquoddy Bay ; and Shediac, on Northumberland Strait, also in the same province. On the St. Lawrence the chief ports are, Quebec, which is accessible to ships of the line ; and Montreal, accessible to vessels of 600 tons. The navigation of the St. Lawrence is closed during the winter. \u00a7 15. j^TURAL FEATURES \u2014 CLIMATE AND PRODUCTIONS. \u2014 The Dominion of Canada has a varied and in many parts an extremely rugged surface, but the mountains seldom attain any great elevation. On the 1. or N. bank of the St. Lawrence the ground rises gradually for some 15 to 20 m. and then is backed by a plateau of moderate height. On the rt. bank the basin is bounded by a series of high lands, emanating from the Appalachian system and which may be distinguished as the Acadian Mts. : these traverse New Brunswick in various directions and are continued into Nova Scotia, where we may notice the Cobequid Mts. between the two forks of the Bay of Fundy, the North Mts., which overhang the coast of that bay, and the irregular highlands which occupy the centre of the penin sula. The largest expanse of plain is found in the peninsular angle between Lakes Huron, Ontario, and Erie.

HYDROGRAPHY. in \u00a7 6, Canada possesses an equal interest with the United States in Huron, Erie, and Ontario, and also has a large section of the N. coast of Superior. The connecting channels and the upper part of the St. Lawrence are also shared with that power, but the most navigable portion of the St. Lawrence, from Montreal to the sea, belongs exclu sively to Canada, and gives her the virtual ownership of the river. The leading feature in the aspect of the river is the tendency to form lake-like expanses with islands interspersed ; such as the Lake of the Thousand Isles below Ontario, Lake St. Francis (40 m. long) above Montreal, L. St. Louis at the confluence of the Ottawa, and L. St. Peter below Montreal. Its chief tributaries are 1. the Ottawa, itself a mighty river with numerous affluents on its 1. bank, but with frequent rapids which impede navigation ; the St. Maurice ; and the Saguenay, remarkable for its profound depth and stem scenery, traversing a deep mountain-cleft with precipices on each side : rt. the Richelieu or Sorelle, the emissary of Lake Champlain, and the St. Francis, both of which fall into Lake St. Peter ; and the Chaudiere, which joins above Quebec. The provinee of New Brunswick possesses the St. John, a very fine and picturesque river, 600 m. long, and navigable for sloops from Fredericton to its outlet in the Bay of Fundy ; the Miramichi and the Ristigouche, which are tributary to the Gulf of St. Lawrence ; and the St, Croix, the boundary stream on the side of Maine, flowing into Passamaquoddy Bay. The navigation of the St. Lawrence system has been rendered complete by a series of canals at the points where there are falls and rapids, of which we may notice the St. Mary's Ship Canal at the Sault Ste. Marie, a fine and massive work ; the Welland Canal between Erie and Ontario ; and the Lachine, Beauharnois, and Cornwall Canals above Montreal. Waterfalls. \u2014 Waterfalls are the one grand feature in the scenery of Canada. Foremost in rank, not only in Canada, but throughout the Cbaud.ere Falls of tlie Ottawa."], [538, "522 DOMINION OF CANADA. Book IV. world, are the Falls of Niagara, the \"thunder of waters,\" 14 m. above tbe confluence of the Niagara with Lake Ontario, where the river divided into two streams by Goat Island, pours a flood of 100 millions of tons of water per hour over a precipioe 160 ft. high \u2014 the Horse-shoe or Canadian Fall having a width of 1,900 ft. and a height of 154 ft., and the American fall half that width and a somewhat greater height (163 ft.) We may next mention the Chaudiere (\"caldron\") Falls of the Ottawa near the town of Ottawa ; the Falls of the Mont morenci (250 ft.) near Quebec ; the Falls of the Chaudiere, also near Quebec but on the other side of the St. Lawrence; the Falls of Shawanegan (200 ft.) on the St. Maurice, 25 m. above its mouth ; and the Grand Falls (75 ft.) of the St. John, above Woodstock. Canadian Lakes. \u2014 The Great Lakes, known as the Canadian group, are situated on two terraces, Ontario alone on the lower one, the remaining four on the upper one. These latter differ but slightly in elevatiun, Michigan and Huron being at the same level, Superior 50 ft. higher and Erie 13 ft. lower. The 3 highest lakes attain a depth of about 1000 ft., thus penetrating into the earth far below the level of the ocean : Erie aud Ontario are comparatively shallow, 204 ft. and 500 ft. respectively. Superior ranks as the largest fresh-water lake in the world : its shores are fretted with bays and fiords, and are gene rally high and rocky: it receives about 40 rivers and 200 brooks. Fish abound in it. Huron has a number of isles about its N. shore, of which Great Manitouliu has a length of 80 m. : Georgian Bay is a large excrescence in the N.E. The S. and W. shores of Huron are fertile. Michigan, which belongs wholly to the United States, communicates with Huron by the Michili-Mackinac Strait : its coasts are regular and its surface clear of islands. Erie is also regular, but has islands at its W. end : it is the most southerly of the group, and hence of much importance as connected with the internal navigation of the continent. Ontario has a regular coast-line in the W. : in the E. it is studded with islands, and encloses a considerable peninsula named Prince Edward's County. These lakes are united by the bond of a single through-current, which assumes the various designa tions of the Ste. Marie between Superior and Huron, the St. Clair between Huron and Lake St. Clair, the Detroit between Lake St. Clair and Erie, and the Niagara between Erie and Ontario, from which it issues as the mighty St. Lawrence, to bear the surplus waters of the whole system to the ocean. Climate.\u2014 The climate is severe, but generally healthy. The western region is favourably affected by the presence of large bodies of water in the lakes, as well as by its more southerly position. The peach and the grape here ripen in the open air, and the black walnut, which is not found N. of the 41st parallel on the Atlantic coast, here flourishes as high as 43\u00b0. The difference between the winter tempera- tures of the provinces of Quebec and Ontario amounts to 11\u00b0 in favour of the latter : the summer temperatures are about the same. The mean temperature for the year at TorODto is 44\u00b0 ; for July 67\u00b0 ; and for February 23\u00b0 ; and the rainfall is 31 inches. Snow lies during the winter in both sections from December to the middle of March, and, in the absence of roads, facilitates the transport of heavy goods by means of sleighs ; in the western districts, however, thaws are of frequent occurrence. In New Brunswick the southern section of the coast on the Bay of Fundy is liable to very heavy fogs ; the northern section, on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, is clear and dry. The range of"], [539, "Chap.

Nova Scotia has a more humid and variable climate. Productions. \u2014 The amount of cultivable soil in the provinces of Quebec aud Ontario is estimated at 90,000 sq. m., or a little more than one-fourth of the whole surface. The proportion in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia is higher. Some districts are very fertile, particularly the part bordering on the S. shores of Lake Huron. All the provinces produce wheat, oats, and barley, wherever the soil is cleared. In the two Upper provinces about 5 millions of acres are under tillage, and in Nova Scotia above one million. But the grand staple product of these provinces is timber : magnificent forests of pine, spruce, oak, maple, &c, cover the interior, and the timber is readily transported to the sea-board by means of the numerous rivers. A considerable amount of sugar is manufactured from the maple-juice. Nova Scotia alone has been so much cleared as to check the timber export. The Maritime provinces possess also valuable fisheries of shad, herring, mackerel, salmon, and haddock. Minerals are comparatively scarce: there are large deposits of copper on the N. shore of Lake Superior ; iron-ore of good quality is found on the Saguenay and the St. Maurice, and in other parts ; but no coal is likely to be found in the Upper Provinces. New Brunswick has a coal-field of 800 or 900 sq. m., some of which lies near the seaboard in Albert county : iron is also abundant. The same may be said of Nova Scotia, which has a coal-field of 750 sq. m. Gold in small quantities has been found in several parts, and mining operations are carried on in Quebec on the river Gilbert, and on the eoast of Nova Scotia about 50 m. E. of Halifax. Petroleum has also been dis covered in New Brunswick and Ontario. The most interesting feature in the zoology of this country is supplied by the periodical migrations of birds in amazing numbers across it on their way to and from the Arctic Seas : among these the Canada goose is conspicuous, supplying both food and fur on a large scale. \u00a7 16. Inhabitants \u2014 Towns \u2014 Government \u2014 Commerce, &c. \u2014 The most noticeable feature in the population of these provinces is the strong French element in Quebec or Lower Canada. Nearly four fifths of the number born in that province are of French extraction \u2014 chiefly descendants of the original settlers \u2014 and still retain their language, religion, and social institutions. In Ontario or Upper Canada the French do not exceed 35,000, and the remainder are British, Irish, Swedes, Germans, &c. The Indians in the Upper provinces are computed at about 40,000, and consist of Ojibbeways and Mohawks. Nova Scotia has a mixed population, in which the Scotch form an important element : the few surviving Indians are ot the Micmac tribe. In New Brunswick there are 1400 Indians, and the descendants of the old French settlers are numerous on the northern section of the coast. Towns.\u2014 The towns are such as might be expected in a compara tively newly-settled country \u2014 neither populous nor handsome. Their growth in Ontario is, however, very rapid; Toronto, for instance,"], [540, "524 DOMINION OF CANADA. Book IV. has advanced from 2846 in 1836 to 19,096 in 1861 ; London, with above 10,000 inhabitants, is not more than 25 years old ; and the same may be said of Hamilton aud other flourishing towns. Wood has been largely used in their construction ; and some of them, as Quebec and Montreal, have a-peculiar aspect from the use of tin to cover the roofs. Conflagrations are of frequent occurrence. Ottawa (14,669), which ranks as the capital and seat of government, is on the river of the same name at the confluence of the Rideau : it has been selected for its high rank partly as being withdrawn from the American frontier and partly as a neutral position between the two Upper provinces. Quebec (51,109), the provincial capital of the Eastern province, is the chief port and fortress of the St. Lawrence, and in the latter respect is deservedly termed the \" Gibraltar \" of America: it consists of an upper and lower town, the former containing the citadel at an elevation of 333 ft. above the St. Lawrence, and occupying 40 acres : adjacent to the upper town are the Plains of Abraham, on which Wolfe met with his end in 1759. Montreal (90,323), the largest commercial city in Canada, stands on an island of the same name at the confluence of the Ottawa and the St. Lawrence, the main arm of which latter is spanned by the magnificent Victoria Bridge, 10,284 ft. long, with 26 piers: it is the seat of various public institutions, of Anglican and Roman Catholic sees eacn of which possesses a fine Cathedral, and of numerous manufactures : its quays are magnificent. Toronto (44,821), the capital of Ontario, is situated near the W. extremity of Lake Ontario, on which it possesses a harbour ; it is the seat of various public institutions, particularly the University. Hamilton (19,096), at the extreme W. end of Lake Ontario, and one of the termini of the Great Western Railway, is a thriving and handsome commercial city. Kingston (13,743), the original capital of Canada, at the other extremity of the lake, is also advantageously situated at the terminus of the Rideau Canal, and is defended by fortifications. We may further notice in the western proviuce London ( 1 1,555), in the centre of the lake region ; Windsor, on the Detroit river opposite to Detroit, the terminus of the Great Western Railway ; Port Sarnia, a railway terminus at the bottom of Lake Huron ; and Goderich, a port on the E. coast of Lake Huron. In the maritime provinces we may notice Halifax (25,026), the chief naval station of Great Britain in North America ; Windsor, on the opposite side of the peninsula, the point of communication with the Bay of Fundy ; Fredericton (6000), the capital of New Brunswick, on the St. John, 80 m. up its course ; St. John (20,716), the chief port and commercial capital of the province, and famed for its ship-building establishments ; St. Andrews, a harbour on Passamaquoddy Bay ; and Woodstock, on the St. John, above Fredericton. Government, Religion, and Education. \u2014 The Dominion of Canada has for its government (1) a Governor-General, appointed by the Crown; (2) Lieutenant-Governors of the several provinces ; (3) a Legislative Council, consisting of 24 members for each of the old Canadian pro vinces, and 10 members for each of the lesser provinces ; and (4) a House of Assembly, consisting of 82 deputies for Ontario, 65 for Quebec, 19 for Nova Scotia, and 15 for New Brunswick \u2014 in all 181. There is no established form of religion ; the Church of Rome predominates in the province of Quebec, and is accepted by a fourth part of the population in Nova Scotia, and a fifth in Ontario ; the Anglican Church and the Presbyterians are influential everywhere except in Quebec province."], [541, "Chap. XXIII. NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR. 525 Primary education is aided by the government, and is fairly advanced in Ontario, and indifferently elsewhere. Besides common schools in each township, there are numerous grammar schools: colleges at Mon treal, Kingston, Toronto, Coburg, Quebec, Fredericton, and elsewhere ; and a University at Toronto. Commerce. \u2014 The staple exports from the Canadian provinces to Great Britain are wood and corn, and to the United States, timber, fish, and agricultural produce. The imports are manufactured goods of various kinds\u2014 chiefly woollen and cotton from Great Britain, and sundries from the United States. The mercantile marine numbers 6575 vessels carrying 943,533 tons \u2014 an amount which entitles Canada to the fourth place in this respect among the commercial nations of the world. Ship-building is a leading branch of industry in the maritime provinces. The commerce with the United States has been checked by the termination of the Reciprocity Treaty. Communications. \u2014 The provinces of Quebec and Ontario are amply provided with arterial lines of communication both by water and by land. Besides the St. Lawrence and its canals, which have been already noticed, there is the Rideau Canal between Ontario and the Ottawa. The railway communications are in advance of the require ments of the country ; the Grand Trunk traverses Canada from Port Sarnia to Montreal, and there crossing the St. Lawrence continues the St. Lawrence route to Quebec, and in another direction makes for the seaboard of the A tlantic at Portland in the State of Maine. The Great Western has a better position for traffic, inasmuch as it forms a link in tbe through traffic from the north-west States (Michigan, &c.) to New York: it also traverses the most fertile parts of Western Canada. There are also lines between Lake Erie at Buffalo and Lake Huron at Goderich ; between Toronto on Ontario, and Collingwood on Georgian Bay ; and between Prescott on the St. Lawrence and Ottawa. New Brunswick has lines between St. Andrews and Woodstock, between Shediac and St. John, and between St. John and St. Andrews. In Nova Scotia, Halifax is connected by rail with Windsor and with Truro. The great Intercolonial line which is to weld together the confederated provinces and to furnish the Western provinces with access to the sea at all periods of the year on British soil, will be a continuation of the Grand Trunk from the St. Lawrence at Riviere du Loup, 110 m. E. of Quebec, to Halifax. \u00a7 17. Newfoundland\u2014 Labrador \u2014 Prince Edward Isle, &c. \u2014 An important group of islands lies about the Gulf of St. Law rence, Newfoundland and Cape Breton at its entrance, Prince Edward Isle, Anticosti and others, within its capacious circuit. Some of these are already attached to the Dominion of Canada \u2014 Anticosti as an appendage of the province of Quebec, and Cape Breton as a part of Nova Scotia. The two others form as yet inde pendent colonies, with their separate Lieutenant-Governors and in sular Parliaments : their incorporation with the strong state on the mainland must, one would suppose, shortly follow. Labrador, on the mainland, is under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Newfoundland. Newfoundland. \u2014 Newfoundland lies off the coast of Labrador at the entrance of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with its E. and S. coasts facing"], [542, "526 PRINCE EDWARD ISLE, ETC. Book IV. the Atlantic. In shape it approximates to a triangle with the apex pointing N. ; but its coast-line is extremely irregular. A long penin sula projects towards Labrador ; a second at the S.E. angle, named Avalon, is connected with the mass of the island by a narrow isthmus between Placentia and Trinity Bays : deep indentations also occur elsewhere. Cape Race, at the S.E. angle, is a well-known headland, lying in the track of vessels bound for the St. Lawrence. The western part of the island, including the northern peninsula, is mountainous; the eastern is generally the reverse. Many lakes occur in the interior, and a large portion of the country is of a swampy nature. The climate is severe, and the soil unproductive, with the exception of some districts on the W. coast and about the rivers. As a fishing station, Newfoundland is of the greatest value. The Great Bank, situated S.E. of the island, and stretching for a length of 600 m. from N. to S., abounds with cod, immense quantities of which are exported to Europe: the seas more immediately adjacent to the island also yield cod, salmon, and other fish. Coal is known to exist on the island. The greater part of the population of Newfoundland is engaged in catching and salting fish, and extracting oil from them. The chief town, St John's (25,000), is situated in the S.E. of the island, and has a large land-locked harbour. Off the S. coast are the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, occupied by the French. Labrador. \u2014 Labrador is a dreary inhospitable region occupying the E. coast of the great peninsula between Hudson Bay, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and the Atlantic. Its inland boundary may be fixed at the singular line of inland waters which crosses the land between Ungava Bay in the N. and Blanc Sablon at the W. entrance of Belle- Isle Strait. Of this large tract little is known beyond the coast, which is visited during the summer by a fleet of vessels engaged in the cod and salmon fisheries aud in seal-hunting. Large establishments for salting fish and extracting their oil are maintained on the shore, and, during the fishing season, the ephemeral population rises to 30,000 : at other seasons a few Europeans and Esquimaux form the only in habitants. The climate is extremely severe, the mean temperature at Nain being 22\u00b0 52' and at Hopedale 27\u00b0 8'. The soil is sterile, and a few vegetables are all that can be grown even in favourable spots. The interior is a plateau bestrewed with boulders, abounding in lakes, and with dwarf trees in the hollows* The Moravians have founded missions among the Esquimaux (about 1300 of whom are under in struction) at Nain, Hopedale, Okkak and Hebron. Prince Edward Isle. \u2014 Prince Edward Island (so named in honour of the late Duke of Kent, who once commanded the British fleet on the North American station), is situated in the S. of the Gulf of St. Law rence, opposite to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, from which it is separated by Northumberland Strait. It has its length from W. to E., and at its W. extremity it projects northwards, terminating in North Point. The island contains no hills of any elevation, .but has an undu lating surface. The coast-line is broken by a succession of bays, inlets, and estuaries, among which Egmont aud Hilsborough Bays in the S. and Richmond Bay in the N. are the most conspicuous. Of minerals the island possesses only coal. Timber is abundant, and the soil fertile. The climate is favourably affected by the surrounding seas ; the scenery is more picturesque and verdant than in the adjacent countries; and the agricultural produce (vegetable as well as cereal, is varied and of large amount. The fisheries are another source of"], [543, "Chap. XXIII. BRITISH COLUMBIA. 527 wealth. The capital, Charlottetown (3500), is situated on the river Hillsborough, not far from the S. coast. Cape Breton Isle.\u2014 Cape Breton Isle is separated from Nova Scotia by the narrow Gut of Canso, a channel 17 m. long and 2$ m. broad, connecting Northumberland Strait with the Atlantic. From this the island stretches away N. with a regular coast-line on the W. and a rugged one on the E., having as its extreme E. point the cape after which the island is named. Lakes and inlets occupy a large portion of the surface, among which the Bras d'Or is conspicuous, stretching almost across the island. In climate and productions Cape Breton resembles Nova Scotia. Sydney, its capital, stands on the E. coast, and possesses a good harbour. Lesser Islands. \u2014 Anticosti is a long island at the entrance of the estuary of the St. Lawrence, with a dangerous inhospitable coast, and a mountainous interior. The Magdalen Islands are a rocky group N. of Prince Edward's Isle. Sable Island lies far away to the S.E. of Nova Scotia and has acquired an unhappy notoriety for shipping disasters. \u00a7 18. British Columbia \u2014 Vancouver Island, &c. \u2014 British Columbia lies between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific, from the 49th parallel in the S. to Simpson's River, which reaches the ocean in 55\u00b0 N.1 lat., in the N. The average breadth of the district is about 400 m. and its length about 550 m. It was constituted a colony in 1858. It is generally mountainous. The Pocky Mts. occupy a belt about 50 m. wide, and seem to be more irregular in the southern part of this province than elsewhere, resolving them selves into peaks and clusters of peaks intermingled with ranges of varying length, some of the peaks being the loftiest in the whole range, Mt Browne (16,000 ft.), Mt. Hooker (15,700 ft.), Mt. Mur chison (15,700 ft.), Mt. Nelson, &c. The passes, however, are lower and more accessible than they are farther S. ; Yellow Head Pass, at the head of the Fraser, is only 3760 ft. above the sea ; Vermilion Pass, at the head of the South Saskatchewan, 4944 ft. ; and Kana naskis Pass, a little more S., 5985 ft. Parallel to the coast, at a distance of about 80 m. from it, there is another irregular range of heights which seems to be a continuation of the Cascade Range of Oregon and Washington. These converge towards the Rocky Moun tains in the S., and render that portion of the country rugged and impracticable. More N, in 51\u00b0-53\u00b0 N., a plain intervenes between the two mountain-belts, expanding from S. to N. The coast line is remarkably irregular, being fretted with deep inlets, and having a fringe of islands separated from it by narrow channels. Rivers. \u2014 The principal river is the Fraser, which rises in the Rocky Mountains (53\u00b0 N., 118\u00b0 40' W.), runs towards the N.W. until iu 53\u00b0 50' N. it meets a more northerly branch named Stuart's River, then descends in a southerly direction almost to the boundary of the 1 The territory N. of Ihis limit is entitled I Frances: ft is temporarily under the jurts- Stiokeen, after the river Stickeen or | diction of the Governor of Columbia."], [544, "Book IV. 528 VANCOUVER ISLAND. United States, when it turns westward and falls into the Gulf of Georgia: it is navigable for about 100 m. up to the point where it bursts through the Cascade range with violent rapids hemmed in by lofty mountain-walls : a bar encumbers its entrance and the approach to it from the ocean is somewhat difficult. The other important rivers are the upper course of the Columbia in the S.E., the Simpson in the N., and the head-streams of the Peace River, which unite W. of the Rocky Mountains, and pierce that chain to join the Mackenzie. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The natural resources and position of British Columbia are such as to excite the most sanguine hopes of future greatness : an extensive gold region has been discovered along the course of tbe Fraser River, and since 1856 has attracted a large number of adventurers, among whom are many Chinese: the richest diggings yet discovered are at Cariboo (53\u00b0 20' N., 121\u00b0 40' W.). Other minerals, lead and coal, are known to exist there. The climate on the coast is moderate and healthy, resembling in many respects that of England, but with a greater range of temperature, the mean summer temperature being 86\u00b0 and the mean winter 15\u00b0 5'. The interior uplands have naturally much severer winters, and snow lies on the passes from October to July. The soil is rich ; wheat and other cereals thrive well ; and an unlimited amount of fine timber, pines in particular, can be obtained from the mountain-sides. The rivers teem with fish, especially salmon. Mosquitoes are a terrible plague. The destined capital of the province, New Westminster, is situated on the Fraser. Vancouver Island, &e. \u2014 Vancouver Island (named after Captain Van couver who surveyed its W. coast in 1792-4) lieB parallel to the mainland of America between 48\u00b0 20' and 51\u00b0 N. lat., having a length of 285 m. from N.W. to S.E., and a breadth of from 40 to 50 m. It is separated from the territory of Washington on the S. by the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and from British Columbia by the Gulf of Georgia, Johnstone Strait, and Queen Charlotte Sound, which are studded with groups of islands. The west coast of Vancouver is deeply indented with bays and inlets, one of which, Nootka Sound, was visited by Captain Cook. The whole circuit of the island offers harbours of the best description. The most frequented are those on the Fuca Strait, the value of which inlet as a natural harbour of refuge from the Pacific can hardly be estimated. The bays which offer harbourage on it are Port San Juan, Beecher Bay, Esquimalt, and Victoria, the last capable of being made a first-class harbour and the natural emporium of this region. The interior is but little known : a range of mountains, which approaches the W. coast, traverses its whole length : the soil is of a rich vegetable character : the climate mild, with an excess of moisture; wood abundant, and fish plentiful. The population consists of 5000 European settlers and 18,000 Indians. The capital, Viotoria, stands on the inlet already noticed, and has risen to importance as the rendezvous of miners proceeding to Fraser river. Vancouver Island is now attached to British Columbia. Of the less important isles we may notice : \u2014 Princess Royal Island, Pitt Island, and Banks Island, with their respective islets, situated close to the shore, and Queen Charlotte Islands, a more extensive group, lying farther out, and consisting of two large islands, Graham and Moresby, and a number of islets : little is known of these islands, but the latter group are supposed to be metalliferous, and its native population is superior to the generality of Indians."], [545, "Chap. XXIII. RED RIVER SETTLEMENT. 529 \u00a7 19. Hudson Bat Territory \u2014 The Arctic Archipelago and Greenland. \u2014 The vast region between the Eocky Mts. and Labrador, the Arctic Ocean and the frontier of the United States and Canada, is somewhat indefinitely described under the general title of the Hudson Bay Territory, or (as it should be more correctly given) the Hudson Bay Company's Territory. The Company in question was formed as far back as 1670, under the auspices of Prince Rupert (after whom the territory is also called Rupert's Land), for the purpose of trading in such products as the country would yield \u2014 furs, fish, &c. : they hold their privileges under a grant from the crown on condition of an acknowledgment of sove reignty. The Company have derived a large income from the sale of furs ; and the country, together with its Indian population (estimated at 55,000), has been entirely given up, as far as the Company are concerned, to the preserving of fur-bearing animals. Their establishments consist of fortified trading posts, to which the Indians resort for barter. The chief port and depot of the Company i3 situated at York, on the W. eoast of Hudson Bay, at the mouth of the river Hayes. The trading forts line the rivers at wide intervals, and extend along the Mackenzie nearly to the Arctic Ocean, Fort Good Hope on that river and Fort Macpherson on ita affluent the Peel being situated within the Arctic circle. The several districts are named after the rivers and lakes, the chief exception to this being the portion called the East Main, along the E. coast of Hudson Bay. In British Columbia and Vancouver Island the Company's authority has been superseded by the Colonial Government. Red River Settlement. \u2014 Although the bulk of the territory belonging to the Hudson Bay Company is unfit for settlement mainly on account of the extreme severity of the climate and partly also on account of the nature of the soil, there are considerable districts in the south which bear a different character. The basin of Lake Winnipeg, containing an estimated area of 400,000 sq. m., offers inducements to colonization, which will ere long be turned to account. The extreme southern valley has been already occupied : bo far back as 1812 the Earl of Selkirk established the Red River Settlement, on the banks of the Red River, just outside the boundary of the United States ; Pembina, the chief town of the district, being indeed within the United States. The population of this settlement consists of 10,000 Canadian, French, and Highland settlers, 40,000 Red Indians, and 15,000 half-castes. The soil is rich, and the climate not too severe for the growth of wheat. Live stock thrives there. Besides this, a large portion of the basin of Lake Winnipeg, including the lower course of the Assiniboine and the Saskatchewan, would by a moderate expenditure of labour on drainage become available for agricultural purposes. The mineral resources of the district are also considerable : salt springs exist not far from the lake : iron-ore is found in close proximity to beds of lignite coal: and, finally, gold has been found on MOD. GEO. 2 A"], [546, "530 ARCTIC ARCHIPELAGO. Book IV. the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan rivers. Nor is it improbable that this southern portion may ere long be a thoroughfare between Canada and British Columbia by way of Selkirk, the Assiniboine, the South Saskatchewan, and the Vermilion Pass, or, again, by the North Saskat chewan aud Yellow Head Pass. The Arctic Archipelago and North-Western Passage. \u2014 Adjacent to the north coast of British America lies that cluster of large islands which has witnessed so much of British daring and suffering in the search after a North-West Passage. These islands are separated from the mainland and from each other by narrow channels, which are imper vious during the greater part of the year in consequence of the accumulations of ice in them. The most direct route from Baffin Bay to Behring Strait lies in about, 74\u00b0 N. lat. by way of Lancaster Sound, Barrow Strait; Melville Sound, and Banks Strait. The islands which line this route on the N. are North Devon, Cornwallis, Bathurst, Byam Martin, Melville, and Prince Patrick, and on the S., North Somerset, Prince of Wales, Prince Albert Land, and Banks Land. A more Moonlight in ArcUc regiuui southerly route follows the line of the American coast by way of Prince Regent Inlet, BeUot Strait, which separates Boothia from North Somerset Island, Franklin Strait, Victoria Strait, and Dease Strait. This latter route was followed by Franklin, in his last memorable expedition in 1847, as far as King William Island, E. of Victoria Strait. A more direct route to Bellot Strait has been vainly attempted from Hudson Strait by Fox Channel and Fury and Hecla Strait into the Gulf of Boothia, out of which Bellot Strait passes to the W. Ruined dwellings and other remains prove that in a far distant age the islands of the Arctic Archipelago were occupied, probably by Esqui maux. Greenland. \u2014 We may add to this section a brief description of Greenland, though it does not form part of the British dominions, but"], [547, "Chap. XXIII. GREENLAND. 531 is claimed by the Danes. It is an island of unknown extent, lying E. of Davis Strait : its E. coast has been followed to 78\u00b0 N\u201e and the W. coast to 81\u00b0 20' ; and its area thus far is roughly estimated at 380,000 sq. m. The E. coast appears to be about the most inhospitable iu the whole world: fields of ice beset the adjacent seas, from the very edge of which glaciers and cliffs of ice rise to a great height. The W. coast has a different character, being deeply indented with fiords, and fringed with islands, some of considerable size : yet even from this side the interior is impenetrable, mountains covered with pereunial snow lining the shore at a short distance from it. The average height of these mountains or highlands (as they may more properly be termed) is about 2000 ft. The only noticeable features are Cape FareweU, on an island at the S. extremity of the region ; and Disko Island, on the W. coast, in 70\u00b0 N. lat. The shores of Greenland are visited by vessels engaged in whaling and seal-hunting. The country itself yields for export reindeer, furs, and eider-down. Coal exists on the W. coast between 69\u00b0 20' and 72\u00b0 5' N. lat., and copper ore has been found at Disko. The climate is extremely severe, the mean annual temperature being 27\u00b0'5 ; very little food can consequently be raised from the soil. The inhabitants are mainly Esquimaux, their number being computed at about 10,000. The Danes have maintained settlements there since the early part of the 17th century: the chief of these at present are Julia nshaab and Fre derickshaab in the S. ; Christianshaab, to the S. of Disko, and God havn on that island ; and Bppernavik, more to the N. The Danish residents number about 300, and are supplied with necessaries from Denmark. Some 500 years since a flourishing Norse community, descendants of the original discoverers of America from Iceland, occu pied the coasts of this island with above 100 villages, two towns, 16 churches, &c. The date and the cause of the disappearance of this colony are unknown ; it seems probable that the severity of the climate has much increased within the historical period. The desolate island of Jan-Mayen, rising in the Beerenberg Mt. to 6870 ft., lies some distance from the coast of Greenland, in 70J\u00b0 N. lat., 7\u00b0 31' W. long. a A 2"], [548, "532 Book IV.

They also hold a detached region in the"], [549, "533 Chap. XXIV. THE UNITED STATES\u2014 BOUNDARIES, HISTORY. N.W. angle of the continent bordering on the Pacific. The southern boundary crosses from the Pacific in 32\u00b0 40' N. lat. to the Gulf of Mexico in 26\u00b0 2' N. lat., the intermediate boundary being chiefly formed by the Rio Grande del Norte. The northern boundary has already been described as coinciding with the 49th parallel in tbe western half of the continent, and striking the Atlantic in 45\u00b0 N. lat., the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence forming the intermediate boundary from the 75th meridian westward. It is difficult to rea lize the extent of this vast territory : a line crossing diagonally from N.W. to S.E. would measure nearly 2900 m., or about 5 times the length of Great Britain ; a line measured from N. to S. along the 98th meridian would measure 1700 m., or about 3 times the breadth of France ; the area (including the N.W. territory) equals 3,511,150 sq. m., or about 42 times the size of Great Britain ; and the popula tion amounts to 31,980,694. History. \u2014 The earliest settlement of a permanent character made within the limits of the Union was in Florida, where Spaniards esta blished themselves at St. Augustine in 15(55. In 1579, the English made their first attempt (an unsuccessful one) at colonization under the leadership of Sir Humphry Gilbert. In 1585, a settlement was effected on the Isle of Roanoke, North Carolina, which also proved a failure. In 1606 the London and Plymouth Companies received their charters from James I., aud in 1607 the former founded Jamestown in Virginia. In 1614 the Dutch made a settlemeut on Manhattan Island, which they named New Amsterdam, now New York. In 1620 the Puritans landed at Plymouth in Massachusetts. In the same year the Council of Plymouth received by a patent from James I. all the terri tory between 40\u00b0 and 48\u00b0 N. lat., under the title of New England. The Council made grants out of this territory to several settlers. In 1634 Maryland was occupied by Irish Roman Catholics under a grant of territory given by Charles I. to Lord Baltimore. In 1664 the English occupied temporarily, and in 1674 permanently, the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam and the surrounding territory. In 1665 New Jersey was settled under a grant made by the Duke of York, to whom Charles II. had given the whole territory from Delaware Bay to Nova Scotia. The Dutch had settled in New Jersey as early as 1614, and Swedes in 1627, but they quarrelled among themselves and were reduced by the English. In 1665 settlements were made in North Carolina on Cape Fear River, and Albemarle Sound. In 1670 South Carolina was occu pied by virtue of a grant made 7 years previously to the Earl of Clarendon and others, which gave them all between 29\u00b0 and 36 \u00a3\u00b0 N. lat. : in 1680 Charleston was founded by the colonists under this grant, whose numbers were shortly after augmented by the arrival of numerous French Protestants. In 1682 William Penn established himself in the territory named after him, Pennsylvania. In 1733 Georgia was occu pied by settlers under Oglethorpe, who founded Savannah. Meanwhile the French who had occupied Louisiana more or less from 16S2, and were well established in Canada, formed a scheme for enclosing the British settlements westward with a cordon of forts, which were to connect the above countries along the course of the Ohio and Missis sippi. War ensued, and resulted in the cession by France in 1763 of"], [550, "534 THE UNITED STATES. Book IV. all that lay E. of the Mississippi to Great Britain; the territory W. of that river, together with the island of New Orleans, having been already in 1762 ceded to Spain. Spain also ceded P^lorida in 1763 to Great Britain, but regained it in 1781. The War of the Revolution, 1775 83, deprived Great Britain of her valuable possessions in these parts, and the Union of the 13 'original' states on the seaboard of the Atlantic was effected in 1787. The chief accessions to the territory of the Union since that time have been Louisiana, which was ceded in 1800 by Spain to France, and was purchased from France in 1803; Florida, which was acquired by purchase from Spain in 1821 ; Texas and California, which were gained by the war with Mexico in 1845-6 ; and Alaska, or the North-West Territory, purchased from Russia in 1867. \u00a7 2. Coast-line and Harbours. \u2014 The United States have a coast-line of 2525 m. on the Atlantic, 1925 m. on the Gulf of Mexico, and 1750 m. on the Pacific S. of British America. The length of coast in the Alaska Territory may be very roughly estimated at 5000 m., giving a total of 11,200 m. There are no deep or large inlets throughout the 3 first sections ; but a sufficiency of harbourage is supplied by the lesser indentations and by the river-openings, which are generally accessible to shipping. The distribution of the harbourage is, however, very unequal, the supply being particularly deficient in the southern section of the Atlantic coast, which is regular and fringed with sand-spits in some parts and elsewhere with islands. The Gulf of Mexico has a low alluvial shore fringed with lakes and lagunes, and here also harbourage is somewhat deficient. On the other hand, the northern and middle portions of the Atlantic coast-line abound with openings which offer fine natural harbours ; and the Pacific coast has sheltered bays formed by the projecting spurs of the Coast Kange. We add a few parti culars as to each of these sections. (1) The Atlantic Coast. \u2014 Commencing in the N.E. angle, the coast of Maine is jagged and rocky, and fringed with islands of the same character to the number of about 400. The chief openings are Passamaquoddy, Penobscot, and Casco Bays: the ports are numerous but difficult of approach, with the exception of Portland iu the S.W. part of the State, which is land-locked, deep, readily accessible from the ocean, and never ice-bound. Between Portland and Cape Anne there is a first rate harbour at Portsmouth, safe, deep, and never frozen. Massachusetts Bay offers harbourage at Salem, whence a large trade is carried on with India and Africa, and at Boston, where the peninsulas on which Boston Proper and East Boston stand enclose a large and protected sheet of water. Plymouth harbour lies at the entrance of Cape Cod Bay and was the spot at which the Pilgrim Fathers disembarked in 1 620. Be tween the peninsula terminating with Cape Cod and the river Hudson, the coast trends to the W. and is sheltered by islands, of which we may notice Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, which iuclose Nantucket Bay on the S. ; Long Island, which skirts the coast in a length of 115 m., and is severed from the mainland by Long Island Sound ; and Staten Island, at the mouth of the river Hudson. The chief iulets in this"], [551, "Chap. XXIV. ATLANTIC AND MEXICAN COASTS. 535 section are Buzzard's and Narraganset Bays: the latter contains Rhode Island and has frequented harbours at New Bedford, the head-quarters of the whale-fishing business, at Providence, which can be reached by vessels of 900 tons, and at Newport on Rhode Island, which was tho first commercial town in the Union down to 1769 ; further W. there is a first-rate harbour at New London, and a good one at Newhaven: lastly, New York has a most spacious, well - protected, and deep harbour, extending from the point where Long Island Sound and the Hudson meet down to the ocean entrance between Staten and Long Islands. S. of New York, sandy spits and shore islands extend from Sandy Hook to Cape May, and render the coast dangerous. Delaware Bay is navigable throughout its whole length of 65 m., and leads up to Philadelphia on the river Delaware, a great entrepot for the coasting trade. From C. Henlopen sand-spits and shore-islands again succeed S. to Cape Charles, the northern portal of Chesapeake Bay. Chesapeake Bay is a remarkable inlet, about 200 m. long, wonderfully indented, deep throughout, and the receptacle of numerous navigable rivers, among them the Patapsco, on which is situated Baltimore, the second port in the whole country; and the James, which leads up to Rich mond : the James joins the bay at Hampton Roads, the entrance to which is guarded by Fortress Monroe on the N. shore, while a spacious and accessible harbour exists at Norfolk on the opposite side of the Roads, the seat of various naval establishments, the chief of which (the Navy Yard at Portsmouth) was destroyed by fire in 1861. S. of Cape Henry, which forms the S. portal of Chesapeake Bay, there follows with slight intermission to the extremity of Florida a succession of spits and shore-islands : the most noticeable features in this section are the dreaded Capes Hatteras and Lookout, Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds, which are only accessible through narrow openings, and are, practically, inland waters ; and Long Bay, which is open and tolerably free of islands. The chief ports in this long stretch of coast are Charleston, whose harbour, formed by the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, admits of vessels drawing 17 ft., and is safe, spacious, and only 7 m. from the ocean; Wilmington, more N., 20 m. up the Cape Fear Eiver, and of moderate depth ; and Savannah, 18 m. up the river of the same name. (2) Gulf of Mexico Coast. \u2014 From the S. coast of Florida a long and dangerous chain of islands, called the Florida Keys, with a reef running parallel to it on the outside, projects W. into the Gulf of Mexico. On one of the islands, Key West, there is a fortified harbour, which commands the Strait, and is a place of call for steamers. The W. coast of the peninsula is devoid of harbours, and the section between the peninsula and the Mississippi offers moderate accommodation iu Appalachicola Bay; a safe and spacious harbour in Pensacola Bay, where tbe United States have a naval station ; and equally good quarters in Mobile Bay: shore-islands stretch in front of these bays and afford defensible positions. Between Mobile and New Orleans a protected passage for vessels is found by Pascagoula Bay to Lake Borgne, and thence by Lake Pontchartrain to New Orleans : this, the great port of the Mississippi, stands 94 m. up the river, and is accessible to the largest ships : the approach to it is guarded by forts 75 m. below the city, which were, however, unable to stop Farragut's advance in 1862. W. of the Mississippi, the coast is low and swampy ; the bays are fronted with islands ; and there are numerous lakes fed by the rivers and approachable through narrow channels or ' passes,' as they"], [552, "536 THE UNITED STATES. Book IV. are locally termed : good harbours are scarce, the best being Galveston, which lies between the island of the same name and the mainland : Matagorda appears to be the next best. (3) Pacific Coast. \u2014 The stretch of coast between the Gulf of Cali fornia and the Fuca Strait is broken about mid-way by a long, ramify ing inlet, San Francisco Bay, capable of receiving the navies of the world, and perfectly land-locked, with an entrance of a mile's width, known as the ' Golden Gate.' There are 4 other land-locked bays ou this coast, Los Angeles and San Diego to the S. of San Francisco, Toinales and Humboldt to the N. of it ; but of these San Diego alone appears to be of much service, Humboldt having a dangerous access by reason of a bar, and the other two being shallow. There are several open harbours, but with the exception of Monterey they are exposed to the S. The Columbia river has a dangerous bar at its mouth, inside which the navigation is good. The TJmpqua Eiver (43\u00b0 45' N. lat.) is more accessible, but tbe depth of water on its bar is less. The pro montories on this coast are Point Conception in 34\u00b0 25' N. lat., C. Men docino in 40\u00b0 25', C. Disappointment, N. of the estuary of the Columbia, and C. Flattery at the entrance of the Strait of Fuca. The S. shore of this strait belongs to the United States, and offers a succession of fine harbours, New Dungeness, Fort Discovery, Hood's Canal, an inlet 60 m. long, and, above all, Puget Sound, 100 m. long, land-locked, deep, and capable of holding the navies of the world. In the N.W. territory the chief port is on the island of Sitka in 57\u00b0 3' N. lat. : the coast u throughout irregular ; the chief inlets have been already noticed in the preceding chapter, \u00a7 4. \u00a7 3. Natural Divisions \u2014 The Appalachian Eegion and the Atlantic Slope. \u2014 We have already given a sketch of the general disposition of the mountain ranges of the North American Con tinent, and we now propose to fill up that sketch by a more detailed description of that large portion of it which belongs to the United States, under the 3 following divisions : \u2014 (1) The Appa lachian Eegion and the Atlantic slope. (2) The Mississippi Basin and the Mexican Gulf slope. (3) The Eocky Mountains and the Pacific slope. The Appalachian Region includes the mountains so named, from the 34th parallel in the S. to the verge of the St. Law rence basin in the N. The Appalachian system consists of 2 sections divided by the river Hudson, to the E. of which are a series of detached ranges and irregular highlands, and to the W. of it the long line of the Appalachian or Alleghany Mts. proper, stretching away for about 1300 m. to the S.W., with a varying breadth of from 30 to 150 m., and an average elevation of 2500 ft. The Appalachian Mts. consist of a series of parallel ranges, the most important and continuous of which is the Blue Ridge, facing the eastern plain S. of the Potomac, and containing Mt. Mitohell (6470 ft.), the culminating point of the whole system, situated in S. Carolina. The main Alleghany Ridge lies behind this, and there are frequently intermediate or outlying ranges of less importance, each having its local designation, such as the Cumberland Mts. in"], [553, "Chap. XXIV. NATURAL DIVISIONS \u2014 HYDROGRAPHY, 537 S.E. Kentucky, Look-out Mt. near the Tennessee, &c. To the N. of the Potomac the ranges are more irregular : the foremost or easternmost ridge is known as the South Mts. ; these are succeeded W. by the Blue or Kittatinny Mts ; and these again by the main Alleghany range. The mountains E. of the Hudson have their specific designations \u2014 the Green Mts., from which Vermont derives its name, between the Hudson and the Connecticut; the While Mts., on the other side of the Connecticut, in New Hampshire ; and the highlands of Maine, which attain in Mt. Katahdin a height of 6385 ft. To the E. of the Hudson the hills cover nearly the whole surface of the country : S. of the Hudson they gradually recede from the sea, and the slope divides itself into two distinct belts, viz. : a terrace with an average elevation of 1000 ft., narrow to the N. of the Potomac, and broad to the S. of that river ; and a low, alluvial coast-land, generally sandy, and in many parts swampy. A granite ridge forms the line of demarcation between these belts. Rivers and Lakes.\u2014 The Atlantic slope comprises not only the rivers which rise in the Appalachian ranges, but also that portion of tbe St. Lawrence basin which falls within the United States, comprising the rt. bank of that river from the point where it is intersected by the 45th parallel to its outlet from Lake Ontario, the southern half of Lakes Ontario, Erie, and Superior, together with the rt. banks of the connect ing streams, and the whole of Lake Michigan. The commercial value of these lakes as a means of intercommunication is very great, but the hydrographical region connected with them is restricted, and we need add nothing to what has been already said in reference to this subject. The rivers that seek the Atlantic from the Appalachian range have a twofold value\u2014 as navigable inlets aud as supplying water-power for machinery. Most of the rivers have falls at the point where the granite ledge separates the upper terrace from the maritime plain. These falls terminate the navigation for sea-going vessels, and are utilized for the supply of motive-power ; hence they generally become the sites of im portant manufacturing and commercial towns, such as Richmond, Trenton, Hartford, &c. The Hudson stands first in point of import ance, inasmuch as it furnishes a water-way in the direction of the Canadian lakes and the St. Lawrence, and is navigable for sea-going vessels up to Hudson, 117 m., and for small craft to Troy, 166 m. Tit has hence become a highway of commerce between the seaboard and the interior, and its embouchure, being favourable to the reception of shipping, is the seat of the great commercial capital of America, New York. The rivers E. of the Hudson run from N. to S. : in this direc tion we may notice \u2014 the Connecticut, which traverses a luxuriant valley between picturesque mountain ranges, and is navigable for 50 m. up to Hartford; the Kennebec, which rises in Moosehead Lake and flows with a tortuous course ; and the Penobscot, navigable for 60 m. to Bangor, and above that point largely used for floating down timber from the interior of Maine. Of the rivers S. of the Hudson, the Dela ware and the Susquehannah flow from N. to S., and the rest from N.W. to S.E. The Delaware rises in the Katskill Mts., and is navigable for sea-going vessels to Philadelphia, 50 m. from its estuary, and for sloops to Trenton, 85 m. : it receives rt. the Lehigh or Leigh and the 2 A 3"], [554, "538 THE UNITED STATES. Book IV. Schuylkill, and 1. tbe Popacton. The Susquehanna is composed of two branches, distinguished as the North or East, and the West branches, which unite near Sunbury after courses of 250 m. and 200 m. respec tively : it receives rt. the Juniata above Harrisburg, and joins the head of Chesapeake Bay : its course is tortuous and broken by falls aud rapids, aud the scenery of the North branch about the Wyoming Valley is most picturesque. The Potomac is also formed by two branches, which rise in the heart of the Alleghanies ; it receives the Shenandoah, which itself has a course of 200 m. at the back of tlie Blue Ridge ; then it bursts through the Blue Ridge with rapids, aud reaches Chesapeake Bay, with navigation up to Georgetown, where there are falls. The James River, another tributary to Chesapeake Bay, rises on the slope of the Blue Ridge, is navigable up to its falls at Richmond, and below that receives rt. the Appomattox. The Savannah, the chief river of South Carolina, is navigable for sea-going vessels to the town of Savannah, 17 m., and for boats to Augusta, 130 m. Of the less im portant streams on the Atlantic slope we may notice from N. to S. the St. Croix, on the frontier of New Brunswick ; the Merrimac, rising in the White Mts. of New Hampshire, and receiving the Winnipiseogee from the picturesque lake of the same name ; the Passaic, AV. of the Hudson, famous for its falls, 70 ft., near Paterson in New Jersey j the Patapsco, which joins Chesapeake Bay, and is navigable for 15 m. to Baltimore ; the Rappahannock, joining Chesapeake Bay about 20 m. S. of the Potomac, navigable to Fredericsburg, 110 m. ; York River, also joining Chesapeake Bay ; the Chowan, falling into Albemarle Sound ; the Roanoke, composed of two branches, the Staunton and Dan, and joining Albemarle Sound, with falls at Halifax, 75 m. from its mouth, up to which point it is navigable for large vessels ; the Pamlico and the Neuse, tributaries of Pamlico Sound ; Cape Fear River, navigable for 90 m., and receiving rt. the Deep River; the Pedee, in South Carolina, with a course of above 400 m. ; the Santee, formed by the juuction of the Wataree or Catawba and the Congaree ; the Ojeechee, 18 m. S. of the Savanuah ; and the Altmaha, the chief river in Georgia, some 5o0 m. long, reaching the sea 60 m. S. of the Savannah. Lakes. \u2014 The lakes of the N.E. district are very numerous, and in many instances very beautiful. The only one of commercial import ance is Lake Champlain, 104 m. long, which forms a link between the Hudson and the St. Lawrence, being connected with the former by a canal and with the latter by the Richelieu, through which it discharges its> surplus waters. Lake George, 36 m. long, lies just W. of Lake Champlain. Wenham Lake, so well known in this country for its supply of ice, is in Massachusetts. Scenery. \u2014 The scenery of the Appalachian region is generally pleasing, and in many parts very fine. The White Mts., in New Hampshire, rank as the ' Switzerland ' of America : they consist of a large cluster or group of hills, 11 of which rise to 4000 ft. and upwards. The Green Mts., though less visited, are hardly less picturesque. The Katskill Mts., W. of the Hudson, aud the Adirondack Mts., W. of Lake George, are favourite resorts of tourists. The gorges through which the rivers force their way are frequently vei-y fine : under this head we may specify the Delaware Water-gap, where the cliffs rise precipitously from the stream 1200 ft. ; Harper's Ferry, where the Potomac bursts through the Blue Ridge ; and the precipices called the Palisades, which skirt the W. bank of the Hudson for 20 m. above New York. Of the"], [555, "Chap. XXIV. MISSISSIPPI BASIN, ETC. 539 water-falls the most noticeable are\u2014the Trenton Falls, on a stream tributary to the Mohawk, 15 m. N. of Utica ; the Cohoes Falls (90 ft.) on the Mohawk itself; the Passaic Falls (72 ft.) near Paterson ; the Silver Cascade, in the White Mts. ; the Katterskill Falls, in the Katskill Mts.; the Genessee Falls, at Rochester, near Lake Ontario ; and, above all, the American portion ofthe Niagara fall, which is, however, not so imposing as the Canadian portion or Horseshoe Fall. \u00a7 4. The Mississippi Basin and the Mexican Gulf Slope.\u2014 The vast region between the Appalachian and the Rocky Mts., and between the Canadian Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico, is almost wholly comprised within the basin of the Mississippi-Missouri. The course of that river is described below ; we here add some few particulars as to the surface of its basin. The Mississippi itself runs in a depressed alluvial valley from the confluence of the Missouri to the sea : the soil throughout the whole of this is of the richest character, but especially in the section between the mouths of the Missouri and the Kaskaskia, known as the \" Great American Bottom.\" Above the Missouri the river works its way through a rolling prairie, the swells of which are marked by the frequent \"bluffs\" on the river's bank. Below the Missouri, the higher ground generally recedes from the river, but approaches the 1. bank between Vicksburg and Natchez. No range of any account breaks the plain between the Mississippi and the Alleghanies : on the other side cf the river the Ozark Mts. form the eastern boundary of an elevated plateau which extends thence to the foot of the Eocky Mts. : the range rises near the Missouri and trends away S.W. to the Eed Eiver : it is intersected by the course of the Arkansas. Prairies.\u2014 The prairies form the most striking feature in the basin of the Mississippi. They extend E. of the river to the neighbourhood of Lake Michigan, and W. of it to the base of the Rocky Mts., an inter minable extent of \" rolling'' plains, with undulations of such vast sweep as to present to the eye tlie appearance of a dead level. As far W. as the Ozark Mountains they are very fertile, and furnished with belts nf wood along the rivers and elsewhere with scattered clumps. In their natural state they are clothed only with herbage and flowers, but under culture they produce luxuriant crops of wheat, maize, and vegetables. To the W. of the Ozark Mts. the more elevated prairies are uncultivable from their extreme dryness: wood is scarce, occa sional clumps only being seen, but herbage and flowers still con tinue and support vast herds of buffaloes, together with other forms of animal life\u2014 snakes, locusts, prairie-dogs, elks, &c. Iu Texas the fertile prairies are separated from the wilderness by a singular belt of scrubby wood called the \" Cross Timbers,\" 400 m. long, aud from 10 to 25 m. broad. In the N.W. of that state the plateau attains an elevation of 2500 ft., and is here called the Llano Estacado, or \"staked plain,\" from the stakes wnich mark the route across its dreary expanse. Rh-ers.\u2014 The Mississippi, the \"Great Water,\" issues from Lake"], [556, "540 Book IV. THE UNITED STATES. Itasca in 47\u00b0 10' N. lat., at an elevation of 1575 ft. above the level of the sea. Its upper course terminates at Fort St. Anthony, 650 m. from its source and 856 ft. above the sea ; in this section it makes numerous falls, of which those of St. Anthony are the highest. Its middle course terminates S. about the 35th parallel, during which it falls 635 ft., its elevation above the sea at Memphis being 221 ft. : in this section it receives two mighty affluents, the Missouri on its rt. bank and tbe Ohio on its left. The Missouri (\" smoky \" or \" muddy water\") has the best right to be regarded as the trunk stream, by reason of its more extended course : it rises in the Wind River Mts., and escapes from the mountains through a wonderful gorge called the \" Gates of the Rocky Mountains,\" situated about 400 m. from its source ; after another 100 m. it makes its series of Great Falls, one of which is 87 ft. : it receives three important affluents on its rt. bank \u2014 the Yellowstone, the Platte, and the Kansas, the second of which is the most important both in size and as being the natural highroad to Oregon and California. The Ohio is formed by the junction, at Pitts burg, of the Alleghany and Monongahela, which streams converge from N. and S., bringing with them the drainage of the W. slopes of the Alleghanies. Below Pittsburg the Ohio has a S.W. course of nearly 1000 m. to the Mississippi, and, with the exception of the rapids at Louisville, its stream is throughout gentle. Its chief affluents are L the Cumberland and Tennessee, and rt. the Wabash, all of which are navigable. The Mississippi further receives in its mid course rt. the Minnesota and the Des Moines, above the Missouri, the Francis and the White River ; and 1. the Wisconsin and the Illinois, above the Ohio. In its lower course the Mississippi receives two important affluents on its rt. bank, viz. : the Arkansas aud the Red River, which flow in their upper and mid courses through a dry sterile region ; and 1. the Yazoo, which joins it above Vicksburg. Below the Red River the Mississippi forms a delta, 15,000 sq. m. in area, and in this region its channels have to be restrained by artificial dykes or \" levies \" to prevent inunda tion during the rainy season. The Mississippi is navigable for large ships to Natchez, 350 m., and for river steamers up to the Falls of St. Anthony, 2037 m. The Ohio has a remarkably placid and uniform course ; by the aid of a short canal at Louisville, it is navigable for steamboats throughout to Pittsburg, and by the Monongahela branch to Brownsville, 60 m. higher. The Ohio is liable to great alte rations in its depth, and at low water the navigation is difficult from sand-bars. The Missouri is navigable in summer by steamboat to Fort Union 2170 m., and during the \" spring rise \" to Fort Benton 400 m. higher. The sum-total of the navigable waters of the Missis sippi basin reaches the enormous amount of 35,000 m. The other rivers that seek the Gulf of Mexico may be conveniently arranged in two groups, according as they lie E. or W. of the Missis sippi. Under the former head may be noticed: \u2014 the Appalachicola, formed by the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers ; the Alabama, formed by the Coosa and Tallapoosa, and joined about 75 m. above its mouth by the Tombigbee from the N.W., below which point the river is known as the Mobile; and the Pearl River, which falls into Lake Borgne. The Alabama is navigable for large steamers to We tumpka, 460 m. above Mobile, and the Tombigbee to Columbus, 416 m. W. of the Mississippi, the rivers rise on the plateau and flow iu parallel courses S.E. to the sea, the most important being the Brazos, navigable in high water to Washington 300 m., and at all times to"], [557, "Chap. XXIV. ROCKY MOUNTAINS, ETC. 541 Columbia, 40 m. ; the Colorado, which joins Matagorda Bay and is navigable to Austin, 300 m. ; and the Rio Grande, shallow and with frequent sand-bars and rapids, but navigable for small steamers to Kingsbury Rapids, 45o m. The less important streams are the Sabine, on the E. border of Texas, the Neches, the Trinity, the Guadalupe, and the San Antonio. Lakes. \u2014 The basin of the Mississippi is generally free of lakes : an exception must, however, be made in reference to the region about its head-waters, where they are very numerous and form the leading fea ture in the picturesque scenery of Minnesota. The coast of the Mexican Gulf, on the other hand, hae numerous lakes or river expan sions, and Florida has a remarkable wilderness of waters, of which the chief members are the extensive jungly swamps called the Everglades, and Lake Okechsbee. \u00a75. The Eocky Mountains and the Pacific Slope. \u2014 The Eocky Mts. are not a single continuous range, but rather a broad belt of parallel or nearly parallel ranges with isolated peaks and groups of mountains. The most elevated portion of the system lies between the 42nd and 43rd parallels, where are situated the Wind River Range, Fremont Peak (13,570 ft.), and the South Pass, a much- frequented route which follows the Sweet Water branch of the North Platte and crosses the range at an elevation of 7849 ft. to Fort Bridger and Great Salt Lake City. S. of this, in about 41\u00b0 30' N. lat., is Bridger's Pass, which forms the line of communication between the South Platte and Fort Bridger, and which follows, on the W. side of the watershed, the desolate valley of Bitter Creek. Following the line S. we may notice the sections called New Park, about 41\u00b0 N. lat.; Old Park, about 40\u00b0 N. lat. with Long's Peak (12,500 ft.); and South Park, about 39\u00b0 N. lat. at the head of the river Arkansas, with Pike's Peak (11,497 ft.) the grandest mountain in the whole range. The upper valley of the Eio Grande del Norte is inclosed at its head by the White Mts., on the W. by the Sierra ie San Juan, and on the E. by the Sierra Moro, standing out from which to the E. are the Spanish Peaks (11,000 ft.). A route crosses the Sierra Moro at Fort Garland between the Arkansas and the Grand Eiver. The plateau on which the town of Santa Fe stands is 7000 ft. above the sea, and the diverging ranges on each side of it rise some 5000 ft. higher. Mt. Taylor in the Sierra Madre on the W. of the Rio Grande attains a yet higher altitude. About the 32nd parallel the ridges decline, though the general elevation continues high. Important routes cross these prolongations of the Eocky Mts. from Santa Fd, W. to the Colorado and California, and E. to Kansas via Fort Larned, and again along the Canadian river to Van Buren. A more southerly line between Houston in Texas and Fort Yuma on the Colorado crosses the lower heights near the Mexican frontier. N. of 43\u00b0 we may notice the Bitter Root Mts. between the 46th and 48th parallels : two routes"], [558, "542 THE UNITED STATES. Book IV. cross the watershed in this neighbourhood, one communicating between Bannock on the river Jefferson and Great Salt Lake City, and the other, more N., crossing by Lewis and Clark's Pass between the Missouri and Clark's Fork of the Columbia. The Great Basin. \u2014 W. of the Rocky Mts. an elevated highland region occupies the intervening space to the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range. The former of these ranges offers no single break throughout its whole length, whereby the interior waters may reach the sea. The basin so enclosed has a general elevation of 50u0 ft., and is traversed by ranges running longitudinally, the chief of which are the Humboldt River Mts. in the centre and the Wahsatch Mts., E. of Great Salt Lake. The Great Basin (as it is called] has an area of 175,000 sq. m. and is generally a sterile, forbidding region ; but the valleys opening out from the Wahsatch range have been rendered fertile through the skill and industry of the Mormons who have reclaimed about 140,000 acres. The water collects in lakes, some of whicb are strongly saline. N. of the Great Basin the Cascade Range allows an escape for the waters through a single cleft, by which the Columbia gains the sea. S. of the Basin the waters seek the Gulf of California through the Colorado. The Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range, \u2014 The Sierra Nevada has a general elevation of 7000 ft. and a maximum elevation of 11,000 ft. in Castle Peak; its snowy summits aud precipitous well-wooded sides, over which the streams break in falls of marvellous height and beauty, have a very fine aspect as viewed from the Sacramento Valley. The highest summit in California, Shasta or Tchaste (15,000 ft.), stands apart on the opposite side of the Sacramento basin. The Coast Range skirts the coast at a varying distance from it \u2014 sometimes sending its spurs to the very shore, elsewhere leaving plains of varying width up to 40 m. The height varies from 2000 to 6000 ft., aud Mt. San Ber- nardino in South California rises to 8500 ft. The range is steep and rugged, and well wooded to the N. of San Francisco. Between it and the Sierra Nevada lies the fine basin of the Sacramento, having a length of 500 m., and a breadth of about 80 m., with an outlet to the sea through a gap in the range. The Cascade Range holds an intermediate place between the Coast Range and the northern extensions of the Sierra Nevada ; it rises grandly to an average height of 8000 or 10,000 ft. with steep well-wooded sides, and contains some of the loftiest summits in the United States, Mt. Hood (17,640 ft.), Mt. St. Helens (13,300 ft.), Mt. Jefferson, and Mt. Pitt: most of the summits are volcanic. Between the Cascade and Coast Range, the rich Wil- lamette valley opens S. of the Columbia. The northern section of the Pacific slope calls for little notice ; the Coast Range, however, contains probably the loftiest summit of America \u2014 Mt. St. Elias (17,860 ft.), together with Mt. Fairweather (14,768 ft.), and other lofty peaks. The Alaska peninsula contains a series of volcanoes. Rivers. \u2014 The chief rivers on the Pacific slope are the Colorado and the Columbia. The Colorado drains a very large district S. of the Great Basin of Utah, but it terminates outside the boundary of the United States, and its navigation, which extends 75 m. to Fort Yuma, is much impeded by shoals. The Columbia is composed of two great branches, the northern one of which rises in British Columbia and receives an important branch, called Clark's Fork, from the Bitter Root range, while the other or southern branch variously known as the Snake River or Lewis Fork, rises somewhat N. of Fremont's Peak:"], [559, "543 Chap. XXIV. CLIMATE, SOIL, AND PRODUCTIONS. both branches traverse a most desolate highland, and uniting about 150 m. E. of the Cascade Range, burst through the opening afforded in the range with a series of rapids 100 m. above its mouth: it receives the Willamette below the Falls. The valley of California is drained by the Sacramento from the N. and the San Joaquin from the S., which unite at the head of the inlet or estuary leadiug down to Francisco Bay. In the Great Basin the chief rivers are the Humboldt, the Walker, and the Carson in the western section ; the Nicolett aud the Bear River in the eastern: these rivers discharge their waters iuto lakes or sinks. Great Salt Lake is about 75 m. long and 35 m. wude, and is very strongly impregnated with salt. The other chief lakes are Utah Lake (35 m. long), connected by a river with Great Salt Lake, and Pyramid Lake, surrounded by precipitous heights and with a pyra midal rock in its centre. The upper river-courses on the high plateaus ou both sides of the Rocky Mts. not unfrequently lie in deep fissures bounded by precipitous walls of rock : such places are termed canons (pronounced canyons) meaning literally \" tubes.\" In Alaska the chief river is the Youkon (the Kwichpak of the Russians), a very large river, navigable for 1800 m., traversing a wooded region, and frozen up for 8 months in the year : it receives the Porcupine or Rat river. \u00a7 6. Climate, Soil, and Productions. \u2014 The general conditions of the climate of the United States have been already described in the preceding chapter. Their influence on the productions and on the population deserves special notice. The warm vapours of the Pacific condensing on the sides of the Sierra Nevada, the Cascade, and the Coast ranges, foster the gigantic forms of sorest life peculiar to those regions \u2014 the Wellingtonia or Sequoia gigantea, which at an elevation of 4500 ft. on the Sierra Nevada near Mariposa attains a height of above 300 ft. and a girth of 35 ft., together with other conifers of nearly equal height, such as the red fir or Douglas spruce, the yellow fir, the sugar-pine, the redwood, and the arbor vit\u00e6. Not less remarkable is the effect of the equable and genial climate of the Sacramento basin, where splendid crops are obtained from a com paratively poor and dry soil through the abundant sunshine and the absence of frosts. Passing E. of the Sierra Nevada, drought and consequent barrenness prevails ; but the aridity renders the climate healthy and habitable, and the winters in the Great Basin are mild for so great an elevation. Drought again prevails on the E. of the Eocky Mts. until the lower level of the Mississippi is attained, and consigns a vast region to the sole use of the Eed Indian and his game! The atmosphere of the whole eastern territory is remarkably clear, and to this maybe attributed the adaptation ot the climate to the growth of maize, which delights in sunshine. The almost tropical heat of the low-lying portions of the Southern States renders them unsuitable to the European constitution in the summer, and necessitates the use of African or Cooley labourers : it also affects in a marked degree the vegetation, which in swampy districts becomes"], [560, "544 THE UNITED STATES. Book IV rank and jungly, as in the cypress swamps about the lower Missis sippi, and the groves of magnolia and palmetto in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. The most fertile portions of the United States are the river bottoms of the Mississippi basin, the upper prairie districts of Illinois and Ohio, the eastern terrace of the Appala chian region from the Hudson to its termination in Georgia, and the low plain of Texas. The maritime plain from the Hudson southward is sandy and sometimes swampy : extensive pine-forests occupy this belt, particularly in North Carolina : the palmetto fringes the rivers and lagunes more to the S., and especially in South Carolina, which is known as the \" Palmetto State.\" The soil and climate of the Southern States are adapted to the growth of cotton, and the swampy parts of South Carolina and Georgia to rice. The districts specially suited to pastoral purposes are the uplands of the North-Eastern States, and the prairie regions of central Texas and W. of the Mississippi. Timber is abundant throughout the whole of the Appalachian region and on the Pacific coast. Maine has the most extensive and accessible stores of it among the Eastern States, and Ohio is known as the \" Buckeye State,\" from the frequency of that tree along its rivers. In regard to minerals, we need add nothing to what has been already stated : the development of these, as well as of the agricultural resources, will be treated of in the succeeding section. \u00a7 7. Inhabitants \u2014 Government, &c. \u2014 Agriculture, Manu factures, Mining, and Commerce \u2014 Communications. \u2014 The population of the United States may be divided broadly into two classes \u2014 White and Coloured. The white is wholly immigrant, chiefly from Great Britain and Ireland, and the remainder from every other European country, but especially from Germany. The coloured falls into 3 subdivisions \u2014 the Red, or native Indian ; the Black, or African ; and the Yellow, or Asiatic, from China and Japan. Of these 3 the black alone is numerically and politically important, numbering (in 1860) 4,435,709 or about one-seventh of the whole population \u2014 outnumbering the whites in Mississippi and South Carolina, nearly equalling them in Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, and forming an important element in Tennes see, North Carolina, Texas, Arkansas, Delaware, Kentucky, Mary land, and Virginia.1 While the blacks increase rapidly, the Eed 1 The States above enumerated, together with Missouri and Nebraska, the District of Columbia, and some of the Territories, constituted the slave-holding section of tlie United States previously to the Civil War. The proportions of the white and black elements in the two great sections before the war (in 1S60) may be gathered from the subjoined table: \u2014 Whites. Blacks. Free States .. 18,741,150 .. 225,916 Slave States .. 8,262,164 .. 4,2151850 Of the Blacks in the Slave States 262,100 were free, and the remainder slaves."], [561, "Chap. XXIV. INHABITANTS \u2014 GOVERNMENT. 545 Indians are dwindling away : their total number is between 300,000 and 350,000, of whom about 60,000 occupy the Indian Territory, and the rest are scattered over the States and Territories, about 5000 in New York, North Carolina, and Georgia ; about 8000 in Michigan ; and the remainder between the Mississippi and the Pacific, par ticularly in New Mexico, Dacotah, Washington, Utah, and Minne sota. They are, for the most part, an indolent, peculating, and savage race, and, even when semi-civilized, thriftless and unsettled. The Chinese and Japanese have recently entered as immigrants into the gold districts of the West, where they are engaged as servants, labourers, &c. The white population increases at a mar vellous rate, chiefly through the immense immigration from Europe. Within the 50 years preceding 1860 the total population has more than quadrupled, and during this period about 3i millions of immigrants are estimated to have come from Great Britain and Ireland, and IJ million from Germany. Ireland alone contributed above lj million in the decennial period preceding 1860. The Germans are most numerous in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Illinois, and Wisconsin : above 4 millions of them retain their mother-tongue, and about 2 millions have exchanged it for English. Considerable diversities of character and bearing have been developed by lapse of time and varying circumstances in the American population. The restless, money-getting, 'cute New Englander (the ' ' Yankee \" proper) is a strong contrast to the chivalrous gentleman of Virginia and the Carolinas : and both these classes, again, differ from the rough and reckless miner of the Rocky Mountains and California, or the sturdy backwoodsman of tbe Western States. The social life of the Americans is much prejudiced by the disparity of tbe sexes, the males outnumbering the females throughout the Union in the proportion of 3 to 2, and the disproportion being much greater in the new than in the old States. The distribution of the population is very unequal \u2014 most dense in New England and the seaboard portions of the Middle States, throughout which the average probably exceeds 100 persons to the sq. m., and most sparse in the Rocky Mountain Terri tories, where it does not exceed 1 person to 5 sq. m. The rate of increase is, on the other hand, in favour of the Western States \u2014 Min nesota having advanced in 1850-60 from 6077 to 172,023, and being estimated in 1864 at 350,000 ; Wisconsin from 305,391 to 775,881 ; Illinois from 851,470 to 1,711,951; and Iowa from 192,214 to 674,699. The Southern States have generally made a less advance; Texas, however, forms an exception, having risen from 212,592 in 1850 to 391,623 in 1860. Government. \u2014 The United States are a confederation of States, free and independent as far as their municipal or internal affairs are con cerned, but subject to a central authority in all questions of imperial or common interest. The central authority is exercised by a President, a Vice-President, and a National Congress, which holds its sittings at Washington. The President is elected, not by tbe Congress, but by the people, under a system of indirect voting : he holds office for a"], [562, "546 THE UNITED STATES. Book IV. period of 4 years, and is theoretically independent of Congress in regard to executive power, of which he is the sole depositary. The Congress has the legislative power : it consists of a Senate and a House of Representatives, tbe former composed of 2 members for each State and appointed for six years ; and tbe latter of members propor tioned in number to the population of the States, together with dele gates from the Territories, who have a right to speak on matters con cerning their own districts, but have no votes : the Representatives are elected every 2 years. The functions of Congress extend to such acts as the declaration of war and peace, conclusion of treaties with foreign nations, coinage, the naval and military forces, taxation, &c. The in ternal affairs of each State are directed by a Governor and a State Legislature, constituted witb some variety after the model of the National Congress: among the subjects regulated by the State Legis latures we may specify all matters relating to private property, public commercial enterprises, police, the militia in times of peace, and the administration of justice. The Territories are subject to the immediate control of the National Congress, and the public officers are appointed by the President. The political position of the following 11 States, which adopted the Confederate cause, is as yet unsettled: \u2014 Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Missis sippi, Louisiana, Texas, Tennessee, and Arkansas. Religion. \u2014 There is no \"established\" church in the United States, nor does Government contribute in any way to the maiutenance of churches and ministers. Christianity is recognised as part of the common law of the land, but, with this exception, the utmost free dom prevails as to religious opinions and practices, and occasionally this freedom developes itself in strange forms of social life, as instanced in the polygamy of the Mormons, the social celibacy of the Shakers, and the pantagamy of the Bible Christians. The most popu lous communities are the representatives of the nonconformist bodies of the mother country \u2014 Methodists, who stand first in point of numbers and are very generally dispersed ; Baptists, among whom are found the majority of the African population; Presbyterians; and Congregationalists \u2014 each of which bodies is subdivided into several sections with their distinctive tenets. The Anglican Church holds a respectable position in respect to the social and intellectual standing of its members : and the Roman Catholic Church retains the popu lation which has come from countries in Europe where its influence is strongest, particularly the Irish. The Germans are mostly Lutherans, and the Dutch are Calvinists. Among the sects that are indigenous to the American soil may be mentioned Mormons, who have their head-quarters in Utah ; Campbellites, who are numerous in the Western States ; Shakers, who have a few thriving settlements in the older States ; Universalists ; and various subdivisions of the larger denominations. Education. \u2014 Elementary education is very generally diffused through out America by the establishment of \" common schools \" in each township, which are supported partly by public taxation, partly by grants of lauds, and partly by the payments of the scholars. These schools are managed by local authorities, with an insufficient amount of State supervision. New York excepted, whicb has an effective governing body entitled the \" University of New York.\" The higher education is provided by colleges connected for the most part with the v.udous religious bodies. Few of these have attained much celebrity :"], [563, "Chap. XXIV. AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURES. 547 yet we may make honourable mention of Harvard University, Cam bridge, founded in 1638; Yale College, Newhaven, founded in 1700 ; Brown University, Providence, founded in 1764 ; Columbia College, New York, founded in 1754 ; the University of Virginia, near Char lottesville, founded iu 1819 ; the Medical Department ofthe University of Pennsylvania, founded in 1749 ; and the Princeton (Presbyterian) College, founded in 1756. Agriculture. \u2014 The United States are an essentially agricultural coun try. The immense breadth of fertile soil, and the adaptation of the climate to the growth of cereals in some parts, and to cotton, tobacco, rice, and sugar in other parts, decide its destiny in this respect. Of the enclosed land, hardly more than two-thirds are as yet improved, while the unenclosed land is more than three times as much as the enclosed. The farms rarely exceed 100 acres in the older States, and even in other parts farms of 500 acres are unusual. The scarcity of labourers has led to a large use of machinery in agricultural operations. The Western States are the great corn producing coun tiies of America, particularly Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin; and, in a lower degree, Iowa, Michigan, and Minnesota. These States are equally adapted to wheat and maize. The Middle Atlantic States are adapted to wheat but not to maize, and even their supplies of wheat are insufficient for their population. The Southern States grow maize, cotton, rice, and sugar : Virginia is famed for the quality of its wheat. California is a wheat-producing region, and already yields a surplus for exportation. Oats are not much cultivated, having been superseded by maize, as food for cattle. Rye is raised for its straw iu tbe Middle States, and buckwheat for sheep-feeding in the Middle and Eastern States. Barley is grown to a small extent only, more in California than elsewhere. Potatoes are a very important crop, the common potato iu the north, the sweet potato in the south. Tobacco is a very general crop. South Carolina and Georgia are most famed for rice and cotton, the finest quality of the latter being grown on the islands skirting the coast and distinguished as the sea-island or long-staple. The sugar-cane does best in Louisiana. A large amount of sugar is elsewhere produced from the maple-tree, which is espe cially abundant in the New England States, and from the sorghum or Indian millet, which has been introduced from Asia. Of live stock swiue take a prominent place, particularly in the States where maize is produced : they are largely killed and cured at Cincinnati (hence nicknamed \"Porcopolis\") and at Chicago. Sheep hold the next place, those of Vermont being particularly fine-woolled. The horses are generally of inferior breed, and are more numerous in Ohio than elsewhere. Butter and cheese are largely produced in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Fruit is a considerable object of culture : peach-orchards are oomtnon in the Atlantic States : the vine is chiefly cultivated on the banks of the Ohio near Cincinnati, and in Cali fornia; and in the latter country the olive and the orange succeed. Manufactures.\u2014 The manufacturing industry of the United States makes vapid advances. The branch which is most distinctive of the country is the manufacture of implements as substitutes for mauual labour in agricultural and domestic operations: many of these inven tions display great ingenuity, and are largely exported to this country \u2014we may instance the reaping, mowing, washing, pumping, and. above all, the sewing machines. The Western States, particularly Ohio and Illinois, are largely engaged in the production of agricultural"], [564, "THE UNITED STATES, Book IV. 548 implements. The application of machinery to the boot and shoe manufacture, to clock-making and to printing, may also be noticed. The textile products are of a rough description, and insufficient for the demands of the country. The number of spindles employed in the cotton manufacture in 1860 was 5,235,727, as compared with 30,387,267 employed in Great Britain at the same period : much of tbe material produced consists of thread, packing cloths, bags, &c. The woollen goods again consist chiefly of shoddy and mungo. The states of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Ohio, and Massachusetts are most forward in textile manufactures. The iron and hardware manu facture is important, but the only branches in which the Americans have become notorious are locks, fire-arms (particularly revolvers), stoves, and some of the machines above noticed. The bulk of the pig iron is produced in Pennsylvania, at Pittsburg, Johnstown (the Cambria Works), and other places. Hardware works are numerous in New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. Jewelry, musical instruments, and watches, are also rising branches. The preparation of flour, brewing beer, particularly the German quality, \" lager beer,\" and spirit distilling, give employment to a considerable number of people. Mining. \u2014 The development of the mineral resources of the United States has proceeded with wonderful rapidity as regards the precious metals, but slowly in respect to iron and coal. California produced gold to the value of above 163 millions sterling in the 16 years preceding 1864, when the mines were first opened. Nevada was \"prospected\" in 1860, and there are now about 100 companies at work on a single lode of silver, known as the \" Comstock Lode,\" near Virginia city : some gold has also been discovered. In Colorado gold-mines were opened at Denver in 1858. and Colorado now stands next to California as a gold-producer, its yield in 1864 being about to the value of 2 mil lions sterling : silver has also been found there. In Oregon rich gold fields have been tapped about the S. and E. frontiers. In Utah, Washington, Idaho, and Montana, miners are at work with good results. In Dacotah a very rich gold-field has been discovered at Sweetwater, 50 m. from Omaha : gold is also reported to have been found in the newly-acquired Territory of Alaska. The production of iron does not proceed at a similar rate : two-thirds of the ore raised is in Pennsylvania, and the remainder chiefly in New Jersey, Ohio, New York, and Michigan. Railway communication has been made to the Iron Mountain and Pilot Knob of Missouri, and these rich deposits have been probably already tapped. The total amount of ore raised in 1860 was only 2\u00a3 millions of tons. The produce of the coal-fields is also small \u2014 about 15 millions of tons in 1S60, a large proportion of which is anthracite. Pennsylvania produces nearly the whole of the anthracite, and nearly one-half of the bituminous coal : Ohio stands next, producing about half as much bituminous coal as Pennsylvania: then follow in order Illinois, Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Indiana. We may further notice mines of copper in Michigan and New Mexico ; of lead in Missouri, Iowa, and Wisconsin ; of nickel and zinc in Pennsylvania ; and of quicksilver in California. Petroleum springs have been opened in North-West Pennsylvania since 1858 and have attracted a large population to that region. Commerce. \u2014 The foreign commerce of the United States is directed to the export of its own raw produce and of the few manufactured goods for which it enjoys an exceptional notoriety, and to the import"], [565, "Chap. XXIV. COMMERCE \u2014 COMMUNICATIONS. 549 of the manufactured goods of the older European countries. The pas senger traffic between the continents is mostly conducted by European companies, and the United States have long ceased to be maritime carriers for other nations. The exports exceed the imports in value : the former consist of raw cotton, specie, and bullion, breadstuffs, and other agricultural produce (pork, tallow, hides, and cheese from the Northern States, rice and sugar from the Southern States, tobacco from both), timber in various forms, ice, petroleum, fish and fish-oil : the im ports, of textile fabrics, woollen, silk, cotton, and linen, cutlery and rail way iron, manufactured tin and lead, china, earthenware and glass, wines, brandy, tea, coffee, and spices. The chief trade is done with Great Britain: then follow, but at a great interval, France, British North America, the West Indies, North Germany, China, which receives supplies of agricultural produce from California, the East Indies, &c. Communications, \u2014 The United States enjoy unrivalled facilities of natural water communication by the Mississippi and its affluents, the Great Lakes, and some of the Atlantic rivers. These facilities have been supplemented by canals connecting the above water-ways with each other at various points. The most important of these links is the Erie Canal, which joins the river Hudson at Troy with Lake Erie at Buffalo, so forming a short cut between the Lakes aud the Atlantic. Tbe Mississippi system i3 connected with the Great Lakes ( 1 ) by the Ohio Canal, between Cleveland on Lake Erie and the Ohio at the mouths of the Muskingum and the Scioto ; (2) by the Miami Canal, between Erie and the Ohio at the mouth of the Miami ; (3) by the Wabash Canal, between Erie and the Wabash branch of the Ohio ; and (4) by the Illinois Canal, between Lake Michigan and the Illinois branch ofthe Mis sissippi. The Mississippi basin is al30 connected with the Atlantic by the Pennsylvania Canal between the Ohio and the Delaware. The Americans have devised a cheap and rough system of building railways, admirably adapted to the wants of a young and growing country. Single lines, unprotected by fences, with wooden bridges and viaducts, and with curves and gradients which would be inadmissible iu our country as being inconsistent with high speed, are here constructed for about 7000Z. per mile. The mileage completed aud in course of completion now amounts to 54,235 miles, and the following companies may be noticed as among the most influential \u2014 the New York Central with the Hudson River line, connecting New York with Western Canada via Albany ; the New York and Erie, which strikes Lake Erie at Dunkirk, and is continued in both directions along the S. shore of that lake ; the Pennsylvania Central, connecting Philadelphia and Pittsburg on the Ohio, and thence continued W. to the Mississippi ; the Atlantic and Great Western, with connects with the New York and Erie at Salamanca and thence intersects the Oil region near Lake Erie, and forms the direct route between New York and Cincinnati ; the Illinois Central, running N. and S. between Chicago on Lake Michigan and Cairo at the confluence of the Mississippi and the Ohio ; the Mobile and Ohio, also a N. and S. line, having its N. terminus near Cairo at Columbus, and thence stretching 472 m. to Mobile and the Gulf of Mexico ; the New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern, the first link in the land communication between New Orleans and New York, terminating at Canton, and thence continued by the Mississippi Central to Jackson (Tennessee), and on to Trenton, where it meets with a line to Louisville on the Ohio and so to Cincinnati : a more frequented route goes from New Orleans by sea to Mobile and thence by Montgomery, Alabama."], [566, "550 THE UNITED STATES. Book IV. ami Knoxville (Tennessee) to Washington. Much interest ia attached to the completion of railway communication between tbe Atlantic and Pacific. The most important scheme is that named the Union Pacific Railway between Omaha in Iowa and San Francisco in California by the route of the Platte river to Denver and Salt Lake City : the eastern section of this line has been completed for 290 m. be tween North Platte and Omaha, aud the western section for 93 m. between Sacramento and Cisco : the distance from San Francisco to New York vid Omaha and Chicago is 3498 m., of which 1788 m. are accomplished by rail, 1585 by stage-coach, and 125 m. by steamboat between Sacramento and San Francisco. A more southerly route is projected across the prairies from Denver by the Smoky Hill Fork to Fort Riley on the Kansas and on to St. Louis: the rail has been carried along this line W. to Junction City near Fort Riley. \u00a7 8. Political Divisions. \u2014 The territory of the United States is partitioned out into 37 States, 9 organized Territories, 1 unor ganized Territory appropriated to the Indians, and 1 District, Columbia, which is under the immediate authority of Congress. The Territories may be described as States in the first stage of growth, only awaiting a sufficiency of population to be admitted into the Union. The \"Original Thirteen\" States of the Union occupy the seaboard of the Atlantic from New Hampshire in the N. to Georgia in the S., and still form the most populous and influential part of the country. Among them we may notice Penn sylvania, the \" Keystone State,\" so called from its central position and its influence in the early history of the Union ; Virginia, its neighbour and frequent rival, the \" Old Dominion,\" as having been the first organized State ; New York, the \" Empire State,\" the first in population and wealth; the two Carolinas, which have played so conspicuous a part in the military history of the Union ; and Georgia, once regarded as the \" Empire State \" of the South, but now clouded by the shadow which overhangs the old slave-owniDg States. Adjacent to the original 13 in the N.E. are Vermont, which was annexed in 1791, and Maine in 1820 ; in the W., Kentucky in 1792, Tennessee in 179fi, and Ohio in 1802 ; and in the S., Alabama in 1819, and Florida in 1820. Of the other important States, Loui siana was admitted in 1803, Mississippi in 1817, Illinois in 1818, and the others at various dates down to the present day. The States are of all sizes, from Rhode Island, with only 1306 sq. m., \" Little Rhody,\" as it is familiarly called, up to Texas with 274,356 sq. m., which is larger than Sweden and Norway together. The States may be broadly grouped into Northern and Southern, corresponding to the old division into the Free and Slave States, the latter including those that lie S. of Pennsylvania on the Atlantic, and of Ohio and Indiana in the interior. But a more complete classification, based on distinctions of position and resources, may be made into the following 7 groups : \u2014"], [567, "Chap. XXIV. POLITICAL DIVISIONS. 551 1. The New England, or North-Eastern States. In these, manu facturing industry holds the first place in consequence of the ample motive power supplied by the river-falls ; commerce holds the second place, and is sustained by the manufacturing activity of the district ; agriculture comes last, much of the surface consisting of uplands adapted only to pasture, as in Vermont particularly ; a large amount of timber is supplied by Maine. 2. The Middle States. In these, commerce holds the first place through the proximity of the coast to the Great Lakes and the Ohio ; hence the products of the north-west are carried across these states to be shipped for Europe. Manufactures are also active from the presence of coal and iron, as well as from a fair supply of water-power. Agri culture hardly keeps pace with the wants of the growing population in regard to corn, but is important in dairy produce, live stock, orchard ing, &c. Mining (iron, coal, and petroleum) is carried on in Penn sylvania. 3. The North-Western States. In these, agriculture (wheat, maize, and pork) is the leading resource ; commerce is active in regard to the transport of this bulky produce ; manufactures are chiefly restricted to agricultural and domestic implements ; mining is a subordinate resource, and is confined to lead near the Upper Mississippi, copper about Lake Superior, iron in Missouri, and coal in various places on a small scale. 4. The Mid-Western States. These are agricultural and pastoral \u2014 the latter chiefly W. of the Mississippi, where the prairies are very extensive and the population scant. E. of the Mississippi, the agri cultural products are varied, \u2014 hemp, tobacco, flax, &c, iu Kentucky, and in addition cotton in Tennessee. 5. The Southern States. These may be conveniently subdivided into two groups :\u2014 (1) The Atlantic States ; (2) The Gulf States. All of them, and particularly the Gulf group, are the 'Cotton' States of the Union \u2022, they also yield other agricultural products, \u2014 the sugar cane in Louisiana, rice in South Carolina, and cereals on the high country of the Atlantic states. Commerce is restricted to their own wants and products. Manufactures can hardly be said to exist. 6. The Pacific States. These are mainly mining districts, but agri culture is rapidly advancing and very successful in California. 7. The Territories. These are exclusively mining. A list of the states and territories with their chief towns is appended below. Origin of the Names of the States. \u2014 The names of the older States are generally significant of events connected with their original settlement. Pennsylvania is named after the Quaker Penn ; New York after the Duke of York and Albany, brother of Charles II. ; Virginia after the virgin Queen Elizabeth ; Maryland after Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I.; Delaware after Lord De la Warr; Carolina originally after Charles IX. of France and afterwards after the English Charleses; Georgia after George II. ; and New Jersey after Lord Jersey. The French have left tokens of their presence in the names of tbe States of Maine and Vermont (vert-mont \" Green Mts.\") in the N., and Louisiana, after Louis XIV., in the S. ; and the Spaniards in Florida, as having been discovered on their Pascua florida or Easter-day."], [568, "552 THE UNITED STATES.

Towns \u2014 Their character and rapid growth \u2014 Note worthy Objects \u2014 Historical Associations. \u2014 The official capi tals of the several States have received their dignity on the score of centrality and facility of communication rather than of size and com mercial importance. \"Washington, the official capital of the Union, is no exception to this rule as far as the old States are concerned : for it stands on neutral ground midway between the North and South, with the great opposing States of Pennsylvania and Virginia on either side of it. The largest and most vigorous towns of the Union are situated in the northern half of the country : in the Southern States New Orleans alone has a population of 150,000, and the next largest is Charleston, which numbers only about 40,000. The North, on the other hand, possesses at least 20 towns having this latter amount, and in some of these the population grows with a marvellous rapidity.

New York has its population increased to above a million by the addition of Brooklyn and Jersey City, which, though separated from it respectively by East river and the Hudson, are really suburbs of it. Cincinnati is similarly enlarged by Covington and Newport, on the other side of the Ohio, to a population of 250,000 ; and Pittsburg by Alleghany and Birmingham, clustering together at the confluence of the Alleghany and the Monongahela, to a population of 180,000. Girard College, rhiladelpMa. Philadelphia and Camden, again, are really one city with a joint population of about 600,000: and, lastly, Boston combined with Charlestown, Cambridge, Chelsea, and other suburbs, has above 300,000. Treating these clusters of towns as individuals, the order of the largest towns is\u2014 New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Cincinnati, Baltimore, New Orleans, Pittsburg, St. Louis, and Chicago. Of these towns New York has been raised to its pre-eminence as the \"Empire City \" by reason of its position on the seaboard, its water- way by the Hudson towards the Canadian Lakes, and its admirable harbour. Philadelphia receives and distributes the mineral and agricultural wealth of Pennsylvania, and is the seat of a large num- ber of manufacturing, scientific, and educational institutions. Boston is the metropolis of the New England States, and the chief outlet for their produce. Cincinnati, the \" Queen of the West,\" is the great commercial entrepot of the Ohio and notorious for its activity m the provision trade, especially in pork. Baltimore ranks"], [571, "Chap. XXIV. TOWNS. 555 as the second port on the Atlantic in reference to the export of breadstuffs, and the first in reference to tobacco. New Orleans holds the first place as a cotton mart, and is also the natural outlet for the produce of the Mississippi. Pittsburg is the American \" Birming ham,\" the centre of the iron and hardware manufacture. St. Louis, in the far West, is the depot of the Upper Mississippi. Chicago, on Lake Michigan, has risen with a rampant growth as the place of shipment by land and by water of the rich produce of the Illinois prairies. If to these we add San Francisoo, the \" New York \" of tho Pacific, the shipping-port of the mineral and agricultural wealth of California, we have named ten of the most important cities of the United States. The occupations of the other large towns may to a certain extent be gathered from the character of the group of States in which they occur. Of the manufacturing towns of the New England States we may notice: \u2014 Lowell, the \"Manchester\" of America as being the chief seat of the cotton manufacture; Nashua, Manchester, Smithfield, North Providence, aud Norwich, in all of which cotton is the leading business ; Lynn, famous for ladies' shoes ; Hartford, for small arms (Colt's revolvers^ ; Providence for jewelry, and Bridgeport for carriages. In the Middle States we may particularly notice the series of commercial towns which line the Hudson and the Erie Canal, and which are largely engaged in the transport of the produce of the North-West to the seaboard, particularly Albany, Troy, Utica, Syracuse (also engaged in the salt manufacture), Rochester aud Buffalo, the last a very large lake port on Erie ; the manufacturing towns of Paterson (silk and cotton), Newark (jewelry, carriages, leather) ; Trenton (various) ; Harrisburg (iron-foundries) ; Beading (cotton and various) ; and Wilmington (gunpowder). Of the towns of the North-west States, engaged in storing and forwarding the raw produce, we may notice particularly those in the Lake region, where besides Chicago we meet with Milwaukee on the W. side of Lake Michigan, Detroit between Michigan and Erie, Toledo, Cleveland, and Erie on the S. coast of Erie ; again the rising towns at the railway junctions in the interior, such as Indianapolis, the capital of Indiana, where 8 lines centre, Fort Wayne, Dayton, and Zanesville, young but remarkably active towns ; and the towns which line the Mississippi to the confluence of the Ohio, St Paul's, Dubuque, Davenport, Keokuk, aud Cairo, all engaged in the river navigation. In the Mid-Western States, Louisville and Coving ton are the shipping-places on the Ohio, and Memphis on the Missis sippi. Lastly, in the Southern States, Mobile ranks next to New Orleans as a cotton-shipping port ; Vicksburg and Natchez are river ports for cotton on the Mississippi ; Montgomery, the most important town in the interior of the Gulf States, Savannah and Charleston, the commercial emporia of Georgia and South Carolina respectively, and Richmond, the capital of Virginia, and, during the Civil War, of tbe Confederate States, a town largely engaged in the tobacco and flour trades. Character, growth, &c, of tlie Towns.\u2014 The towns in the United States are generally built in quadrangular \" blocks\" of buildings, with broad main streets running longitudinally, and narrower streets crossing them at right angles. Thus the upper part of New York is laid out in 12 2 B 2"], [572, "Booi; IV. 556 THE UNITED STATES. parallel streets or \" Avenues,\" distinguished by numbers, as, \"Fifth Avenue \" which is the most fashionable quarter, \" Tenth Avenue,\" &e. The cross streets are also distinguished by numbers, such as 14th Street, aud 23rd Street, which are also fashionable quarters. Some of tlie streets are of immense width and length. Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, for instance, attains to a width of 160 ft. and a length o' 4 m., and from the vistas thus afforded, combined with the intervals between the various edifices, AVashington has been well entitled the \"City of Magnificent Distances.\" The breadth of the streets renders the foliage of \" shade \" trees very acceptable, and some towns are profusely planted with avenues, particularly Cleveland on Lake Erie, the \" Forest City of the North,\" Savannah in Georgia, the \"Forest City of the South,\" which has no less than 4 fine rows of trees in its broadest streets, and Newhaven in Connecticut, distinguished as the \"Elm City,\" from the number of elms in it. The regularity of the streets has facilitated the formation of street railways, of which New York possesses 307 m., Philadelphia 183 m., and other large towns proportionate quantities. Some of the older towns are laid ont with less precision, and gain thereby in picturesque effect : this is par ticularly the case with Boston, which climbs the slopes of a three summited peninsula with irregular circuitous streets : the peculiarity of its site has led to its designations, \"Tremont\" and the \"Mountain City in the Sea.\" Wood is largely used in the construction of the houses in the younger towns, and hence devastating conflagrations are of frequent occurrence, and have led to the formation of an admirable system of fire-brigading in the large towns. Stone and brick are used where they can be got, and one of the rising cities of the North-West, Milwaukee, is distinguished as tho \" Cream City \" from the colour and smoothness of its bricks. The growth of the American towns, par ticularly in the North-Western States, is perfectly astounding : Chicago, on Lake Michigan, is in this respect a \"typical town \u2014 a village of 35 log-houses in 1833, a town of 7580 inhabitants in 1843, a vast metro polis with a population of 178,539 in 1865, with 15 railways radiating from it, 100 trains arriving or departing daily, 112 churches, 4 public parks, 12 cemeteries, &c, &c. Milwaukee, again, has grown up from a population of 1751 in 1840 to one of 20,061 in 1850 ; St. Louis from 6694 in 1830 to 160,773 in 1860; and towns whose names are unknown in Europe have attained not unfrequently to populations of 8000 or 10,000 within half-a-dozen years. The growth of the mining towns in the Pacific States is no less remarkable, and the discovery of the oil-springs in Pennsylvania has produced a cluster of vigorous towns, Corry, Titusville, Pithole, Oil City, &c, on sites occupied in 1860 by virgin forests. The names of the American towns are not happily chosen : the names of the favourite statesmen are repeated so frequently as to create great coufusion : Washington 169 times, Jackson 132 times, Jefferson 86 times, Perry 55 times, and so forth. The revival of classical and biblical names \u2014 Troy, Athens, Carthage, Utica, Goshen, Eden, &c, is hardly in good taste. Some ofthe New England names \u2014 Providence, Salem, Concord \u2014 have an interest as savouring of the Pilgrim Fathers, and Philadelphia the \" city of brotherly love \" carries us back to the days of Penn. Noteworthy Objects. \u2014 The American cities have but few of those architectural monuments which are the pride and glory of European towns, and these few lack, as a matter of necessity, the charms of antiquity and originality. The salient feature in the arrangements of"], [573, "Chap. XXlY. TOWNS \u2014 HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS. 557 American towns is their spaciousness, as displayed not only in the streets, but in the capitols, the hotels, the parks, the market-places, and the cemeteries. In Washington the Capitol covers 3J acres and stands in an enclosure of about 30 acres : the White House or President's residence has 20 acres of ground about it; the Smithsonian Institute 50 acres. The Capitols are usually built in the ancient classical styles with domes : the finest are those at Washington, the dome rising 241 ft. above the roof of the main edifice ; at Nashville, Tennessee, massive and ornamented in the interior with variegated marbles ; and at Columbus, Ohio. In ecclesiastical buildings there is little to note : they are numerous enough, and Brooklyn is styled the \" City of Churches,\" from having 174 such edifices; but they are rarely in good taste or fine. Among the best we may specify, in New York, Trinity Church, rebuilt in 1 846, with a spire 284 ft. high ; Grace Church, an ornate Gothic building ; and Calvary Church, with two western spires. Statuary is rarely displayed in the streets : Baltimore enjoys a pre eminence in this way, being styled the \"Monumental City,\" by virtue of a statue of Washington, 212 J ft. high, and the Battle Monument in honour of the defenders of the city iu 1814. There are fine sus pension bridges over the Ohio at Wheeling (1010 ft.) and at Cincin nati (2252 ft.) with a central span of 1057 ft.; and over the Niagara, 2 m. below the falls, 258 ft. above the water, and 800 ft. span. The length of the ordinary railway bridges is frequently very great, amounting at Hartford, over the Connecticut, to 1525 ft., and at Harrisburg, over the Susquehanna, to 3670 ft. The cemeteries are frequently spacious, beautifully situated and carefully kept : we may instance the Greenwood Cemetery, Brooklyn (242 acres) ; the Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati (277 acres) ; the Laurel Hill Cemetery, Philadelphia (150 acres), with charming views of the Schuylkill Falls ; the Bonaventure Cemetery, Savannah, with noble avenues of forest trees; and the Bellefontaine Cemetery, St. Louis (350 acres). At New Orleans the cemetery is a solid mass of masonry, and the corpses are deposited in cells, the oozy nature of the soil not allowing of the ordinary mode of burial. The public parks ure also well laid out : foremost under this head is the Central Park, New York, in 3 divisions ; the Lower one containing 336 acres, and the Middle one being partly occupied by the large New Reservoir (106 acres) of the Croton water-works. The market-places are also on a grand scale : the Union Stock-yards at Chicago occupy 345 acres, and are laid out in streets and avenues. Libraries, Colleges, Philosophical Institutes, are found in all the large towns, and have spacious and valuable buildings : Philadelphia is particularly rich in such ; the Girard Orphan College is regarded as one of the finest. Of the few comparatively ancieDt buildings which have historical interest attached to them, we may specify Faneuil Hall, Boston, the \"Cradle of Liberty,\" built as a market-place in 1 740-2 ; and Independence Hall, Philadelphia, where the Declaration of Independence was made in 1776. Historical Associations. \u2014 The most important events in the history of the United States belong to two periods\u2014 the War of Independence 1775-83, and the Civil War between the Federals and Confederates 1861-65. The former commenced in New England, and thence spread over the whole of the older or Atlantic States. The opening events occurred in Massachusetts at the following places\u2014 Boston, where the tea-duty met with violent resistance, 1773: Bunker's Hill, battle of June 17, 1775 ; Lexington and Concord, the first engagements in the"], [574, "558 THE UNITED STATES.

The Civil War of 1861-65 prevailed more or less over the whole of the Southern States and several of the Mid-Western States, but the brunt of the contest was borne by Virginia, and particularly by the northern section of it between Richmond and Washington.

These rivers supply successive lines of defence, but the positions on them may one and all be turned by the Valley of the She nandoah, which runs at right angles to them at the back of the Blue Ridge, and opens out to the Potomac at Harper's Ferry. Both sides availed themselves of this line on several occasions, and much fighting occurred about Harper's Ferry, the key of the valley, and at Winchester and other places in the valley. The Confederates carried the war across the Potomac on 3 occasions \u2014 in 1862, when they were checked by the great battle of Sept. 17 at Antietam Creek which joins the Potomac above Harper's Ferry ; in 1863, when they advanced into Pennsylvania and encountered the Federals in a 3 days' battle, July 1-3, at Gettys burg near the head of the Monocacy ; and in 1864, when they reached the Monocacy about 3 m. S. of Frederick, and placed Washington in imminent danger, beating the Federals July 9, but beiug beaten July 12. The Federals, on the other hand, persisted in their attempts to reach Richmond, and in this they succeeded after repeated failures : the scenes of the chief events being \u2014 Bull Bun, where the first battle was fought, July 1, 1861, and a subsequent one, Aug. 29 and 30, 1862; Fredericksburg, on the Rappahannock, which witnessed one of the most terrible battles of the war, Dec. 13, 1862 ; Chancellorsville, in the same quarter, the battle of May 2, 1863; the Wilderness and Spott sylvania, S.of the Rapidan, where the Federals under Grant sustained severe but indecisive contests in the early part of May, 1864; Fair Oaks and Mechanicksville, just in front of Richmond, where M'Clellan's progress was checked in June, 1862 ; and Petersburg, 21 m. S. of Richmond, which witnessed severe fighting in 1865, and fell into the hands of the Federals simultaneously with Richmond, April 3, 1865. The other operations of the war were subsidiary to this great object, and consisted partly in the blockade and ultimate capture of the sea port towns \u2014 New Orleans in 1862, Mobile, where the Confederate fleet was destroyed by Farragut in 1864, Charleston, which witnessed the first outbreak of the war in the attack on Fort Sumter, April 11, 1861, and was subsequently besieged but not taken until the close of the war, and Wilmington, which was much frequented by blockade-runners, and which also escaped capture until Feb. 22, 1865 \u2014 and partly in campaigns intended to sever and distract the armies of the Con federates, among which we may notice the operations about Chatta nooga, on the Tennessee, in 1863, involving the battles of the Chicka manga, Sept. 20, the engagements of Look-out Mt., Oct. 27-29, and the battle of Chattanooga itself, Nov. 25, the two latter of which were disastrous to the Confederates and the first to the Federals; and Sherman's famous expedition in 1864-5, which led to the battles in front of Atlanta and the capture of that place, Sept. 3, the capture of Savannah, Jan. 17, 1865, and the reduction of Charleston."], [576, "too Tini- \u25a0\u25a0s os T\"\\ttia1.

Boundaries \u2014 Area and Population \u2014 Historical Geo graphy. \u2014 Mexico is the most southerly division of North America, situated \"between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, and having as its adjacent countries, N., the United States, and S., Guatemala and British Honduras. It stretches through 17 degrees of latitude from 15|\u00b0 to 321\u00b0, and has a length of about 1800 m., and a \"breadth varying from 137 m. at the isthmus of Tehuantepec to about 550 m. at the Tropic of Cancer and 1250 m. along the northern frontier. The area is estimated at 773,125 sq. m., and the population at 8,218,0S0. Historical Geography. \u2014 The modern history of Mexico dates from the successful invasion of the Spaniards under Cortez iu 1519 \u2014 -21, ending with the capture of the city of Mexico in the latter year. The country"], [577, "Chap. XXV. NATURAL FEATURES. 561 was held as a dependency of Spain down to 1820, and at that time extended along the Pacific to about 43\u00b0 N. lat., and along the Gulf of Mexico to the river Sabine, thus about doubling its present area. In 1820 it became an independent state, and from that date it has retro graded in every way, having lost its northern territories to the United States, and having been torn by intestine factions until it has become a by-word among civilised nations for anarchy and misery. \u00a7 2. Natural Features\u2014 Climate and Productions. \u2014 Mexico occupies the greater part of the lofty table-land which we have already noticed as forming the southern division of the North Ame rican highland. The altitude of this table-land ranges from 6500 ft. to 8500 ft., the city of Mexico standing at 7426 ft., Toluca at 8450 ft., Puebla at 7137 ft., Guanajuato in 21\u00b0 N. lat. at 6800 ft., and the extreme N. at about 8000 ft. The continuity of the table land is remarkable : it consists of a series of plains or large shallow basins, divided by ridges of varying height, extending without intermission from Mexico to Santa Fe, a distance of some 1400 m., and affording a natural road between those distant points. The southern part of the table-land is designated Anahuao, meaning in the Aztek language \" near the water,\" and applied by them to the valley of Mexico with its group of lakes, which formed the nucleus of their empire : the name is now extended over the whole of the southern region. The north-central part is variously termed the table-land of Chihuahua or New Spain, and the north-western part the table-land of Sonora. The mountain ranges marked on the maps of Mexico are in the S. little else than the rims of the table land, hardly, if at all, over-topping the general level of the interior : as they advance N. they assume more decidedly the aspect of moun tains, and develop into the 3 ranges of Sierra Madre in the centre, Sra. Guadalupe in the E., and Sra. Sonora in the W. A volcanic belt crosses the plateau of Anahuac about the 19th parallel, sending up 13 cones, some of which retain their significant Aztec names: the most observable of these cones are Iztaccihuatl, the \" White Woman \" (15,700 ft.) and Popocatepetl, the \" Smoking Mountain \" (17,716 ft.), which lie together between Puebla and Mexico; Cofre de Perote (13,415 ft.), and Pico de Orizaba or Citlaltepetl, the \" Star mountain \" (17,373 ft.), which lie between Puebla and \"Vera Cruz; Tuxtla, which stands by itself near the Mexican Gulf; Nevado de Toluca (15,160 ft.), W. of Mexico ; Jorullo, still more W., which was thrown up in 1759 to a height of 1375 ft. above the plain on which it stands, and of 4265 ft. above the sea ; and Colima, near the Pacific. These volcanoes are in a quiescent state, Popocatepetl alone emitting vapour. The table-land descends sharply on each side to a maritime region of varying width : the edges of the slopes are furrowed with deep fissures, termed Barrancas. The level of the table-land declines 2 b 3"], [578, "562 MEXICO. Book IV. at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to a maximum height of 650 ft. between the oceans. The peninsula of Yucatan is low and flat. Coast-line \u2014 Mexico possesses a coast-line of about 1500 m. on the Gulf of Mexico, and of about 2200 m. on the Pacific, exclusive of the long stretch on each side of the Gulf of California. The prominent features in it are, on the E. coast, the large rectangular peninsula of Yucatan, terminating N.E. in C. Catoche ; and on the W. coast, the peninsula of California, terminating in C. St. Lucas and inclosing on the W. the Gulf of California : C. Corrientes, in 20\u00b0 22' N. lat., is a noticeable promontory on this coast. The harbours on the Gulf of Mexico are indifferent. They consist either of river estuaries or of roadsteads sheltered by shoals : this latter is the case with Vera Cruz, the leading port in the country, where the vessels lie between the town and the shoal of La Gallega, well protected from naval attack by the fortress of San Juan de Ulua, but ill-protected from the violent nortes or northerly gales. Sizal, on Yucatan, is a harbour of similar formation. The river harbours are \u2014 the mouth of the Coatzacoalco, reputed the best, on the isthmus of Tehuantepec ; Alvarado, S. of Vera Cruz ; Tampico at the mouth of the Panuco, safe and roomy with 1 2 ft. of water on the bar; and Matamoros about 40 m. up the Rio Grande del Norte. Campeachy, in Yucatan, has a shallow harbour, protected by a mole. The Pacific ports are better, but are little frequented; Acapulco, S. of Mexico, is the leading one and has good capacities, being deep and spacious : of the rest we may mention Ventosa as one that would be of importance if a route were carried across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec ; the river-port of Zacatula, N. of Acapulco ; San Bias still higher up ; Mazatlan, at the entrance of the Gulf of California, the most frequented harbour in Northern Mexico ; and Guaymas, a fine harbour halfway up the Gulf of California. Rivers and Lakes. \u2014 Mexico is badly watered, the rivers having short and steep beds, generally cut deeply below the surface of the ground. The Rio Grande Del Norte has been already noticed ; the rivers joining the Gulf of Mexico are the Santander, the Panuco with its tributary the Tamesi, the Alvarado, and the Tabasco; those joining the open Pacific are the Rio Grande de Santiago, the emissary of Lake Chapala, and the Eolsas ; and those falling into the Gulf of California the Culi acan, the Fuerte, the Yaqui, and the Sonora. The largest lake is Chapala (50 m. long) on the W. side of the table-land ; the valley or basin of Mexico contains a group of 5 lakes, occupying an aggregate area of 110,000 acres, and named Tezcuco, close to Mexico, Chalco, San Cristobal, Xochimilco, and Zumpango: Tezcuco is strongly saline, Chalco fresh, and the three others brackish. Tezcuco stands lowest of the series, and, as its ordinary level is only 3J ft. below that of the city, it inundates the lower parts of it during the rainy season. Schemes have been set on foot for regulating its level, but they have not been fully carried out. Another group of 9 lakes lies N. of Zaca tecas, and a third group of 5 about Chihuahua. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The varyiug altitude of Mexico supplies it with every gradation of temperature from the tropical heat of the coast to the perpetual snows of the volcanic peaks. The table-land generally is blessed with a temperate and equable climate, which renders it suitable to the European constitution. The Mexicans them selves divide their land into 3 climatic zones \u2014 the Torrid Region (Tierra Calienle), on the coast, with a mean annual temperature of 77\u00b0 ;"], [579, "Chap. XXV. CLIMATE AND PRODUCTIONS. 563 the Temperate Region (Tierra Templada), on tbe slopes of the table land, 68\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 ; and the Cold Region (Tierra Fria), on the table-land itself, having a temperature at Mexico itself of 64\u00b0, and elsewhere vary ing with the altitude. The vegetation varies with the temperature, and takes in a wide range oi tropical and European productions. The plants most characteristic of the Mexican table-lands are the maguey (Agave Americana), from which the Aztecs of old as well as their modern suc- cessors have extracted the intoxi- cating beverage called pulque; and the nopal or cactus. The cacao anil vanilla plants, the medicinal sarsa- parilla and jalap (so called from Ja- lapa), are also specialties of Mexico ; and maize and cotton are indigenous. Among the imported plants which now thrive there, we may mention the sugar-cane, which succeeds uni- versally up to an elevation of 3250 ft., and even higher in sheltered spots ; the banana, the manioc or cassava, the coffee and indigo-plants in the coast district ; the European cereals, with the vine and olive, on the table-land ; and the orange and lemon in the tierras templadas. Iu regard to animals we have only to notice the cochineal insect, from which a valuable dye is extracted and which feeds on certain species of the cactus order in the tierras templadas. The turkey is a native Agave Americana. of Mexico, but every other domesticated animal, except a kind of dog, has been imported by the Spaniards. The mineral wealth of Mexico is very great, though its yield of the precious metaU is now surpassed by California and Australia. Silver is its special metal : there are numerous argentiferous veins of great size on the N.W. slope near the Gulf of California as well as about Guanajuato, and the mines are advantageously situated at moderate elevations. The most famous silver mines are situated in the provinces of Guanajuato (Valenciana^ Zacatecas (Fresnillo, &c), San Luis Potosi (Catorce), Mexico (Real del Monte and Pachuca), and Durango. Gold is abun dant in Sonora, and probably in Sinaloa, bu+ in neither has mining been vigorously prosecuted : the southern province of Oajaca has gold mines. Salt and carbonate of soda are obtained from certain of the lakes. Coal is said to exist, but no mines have been opened. \u00a73. Inhabitants \u2014 Political Divisions \u2014 Towns, &c. \u2014 The population of Mexico is composed of the following elements: \u2014 (1) Indians, about 5 millions; (2) Mixed races, about 2 millions; and (3) Whites, about 1 million. Each of these is subdivided into numerous classes \u2014 the whites into (1) Europeans, chiefly Spaniards"], [580, "Book IV. 564 MEXICO. (40,000); (2) Creoles or the descendants of Spaniards (300,000); and (3) a section of the mixed Spaniards and Indians, who claim to be whites (700,000) : the mixed into (1) Mestizoes, European and Indian ; (2) Mulattoes, European and Negro ; and (3) Zamboes, Indian and Negro. The Indians are the only important coloured element. The negroes, at no period, numerous in Mexico, now number 6000. The political and social state of the country is miser able in the extreme : no stable government has subsisted there for the last half century, and it is difficult to describe the present consti tution otherwise than as a military dictatorship. The Church of Borne is exclusively followed in religious matters, and the priesthood form an influential political element. Agriculture, mining, manu factures, and commerce are all in a state of collapse, and the chief exports consist of mahogany, log-wood or Cam peachy-wood, cochi neal, sarsaparilla, &c. The country was divided, previously to 1865, into 25 states, exclusive of the city of Mexico: this division has been superseded by one into 50 departments, the names of which correspond generally with those of their capital towns. Towns \u2014 The towns are built after the Spanish fashion with large open squares, alamedas, &c. The ecclesiastical buildings \u2014 churches, convents, and colleges \u2014 are numerous, and generally speaking fine : their domes, spires, and towers give the Mexican cities an imposing aspect. The aqueducts are also fine. Mexico, the capital, stands mid way between the two oceans, and in the centre of the plain or valley of Mexico, having Lake Tezcuco close to it on the E. and Lake Xochimilco to the S. of it : it is regularly built, and altogether a remarkably fine town, with an imposing cathedral, convents, &c. : its population is esti mated at 150,000, but under the Azteks Tenochtitlan (as it was then called) numbered 300,000 inhabitants. Puebla (75,000), on the road between Mexico and Vera Cruz, is the most active manufacturing and trading town, and possesses the finest cathedral in the country. Guadalajara (70,000), on the Santiago near the W. verge of the table land, is famous for its leather-work aud earthenware. Guanajuato (63,000 1, in a narrow and deep ravine, owes its prosperity to the adja cent silver mines. Queretaro (48,000), the first large town on the N. road out of Mexico, carries on woollen manufactures, and has a very fine aqueduct : it has been the focus of many revolutionary movements, and is the spot where the Emperor Maximilian made his last stand in 1867. Of towns that have risen to importance through the mines we may further notice :\u2014 San Luis Potosi (31,0u0), near the head of the Tam pico ; Zacatecas (16,000), 150 m. N.W. of Guanajuato, situated in a deep narrow ravine, with the huge convent of Guadalupe near it ; Durango (14,000), near the Culiacan; and Chihuahua (12,000), in the extreme N. We may further notice Morelia or Valladolid (25,000), which lits W. of Mexico, iu a fertile agricultural country ; Colima (31,000), at the foot of the volcano of the same name, near the Pacific ; Aguas Calientes > 23,000), S. of Zacatecas, with woollen manufactures and with hot springs (as tbe name implies); Oajaca (25,000), S.E. of Mexico, iu the best cochineal and cacao district ; and Merida (24,000\\ the capital us Yucatan. The coast district is generally too hot and"], [581, "Chap. XXV. TOWNS. 565 unhealthy for Europeans to occupy it permanently. Vera Cruz (10,000) is surrounded by marshes and is frequently visited by the yellow fever. Campeachy ( 15,500) is, however, an exception to the above description, being tolerably healthy. Pyramid at Cimal. The antiquities of Mexico are of great interest, consisting in the S. of the ruins of vast cities with pyramids, temples, palaces, and sculptured idols at Palenque in Chiapas, Uxmal, Chi-chen, Zaya, and other places in Yucatan, and Mitla in Oajaca ; and elsewhere of pyramids, such as those of Cholula, Tezcuco, and Teotihuacan (one at the latter place 180 ft. high with a square base of 682 ft.). In the N. there are the sites of towns at Los Edifieios in the province of Zacatecas, and Casas Grandes in Chihuahua. These remains are now attributed to the Toltecs rather than to the Azteks, and are consequently of great antiquity. II. Central America. \u00a7 4. Boundaries \u2014 States \u2014 Historical Geography. \u2014 Central America, as a natural division, would include the whole of the narrow neck which serves as a causeway to connect the two great divisions of the continent, from the Isthmus of Darien in the S. to that of Tehuantepec in the N. As a political division, Central America is restricted to narrower limits by the annexation of the extreme northern district to Mexico and of the southern to New Granada. In the latter sense it extends through 10 degrees of longi tude between 82\u00a3\u00b0 and 92\u00a3\u00b0, and 10J\u00b0 of latitude between 8\u00b0 and 18\u00a3\u00b0, having its length in the direction of N.W. and S.E. It com prises the following States : \u2014"], [582, "CENTRAL AMERICA. Book IV. 566 Historical Geography. \u2014 The whole of Central America was claimed by Spain by virtue both of discovery and occupation, and the only power which successfully resisted this claim was Great Britain, who in 1638 and 1640 established settlements on the coast for the purposes of cutting and shipping mahogany-wood. Her right to trading-settle ments was recognized by the treaties of 1783 and 1786, but no terri torial sovereignty was conferred. On the collapse of the Spanish power the independent states endeavoured to confine the British to the coast, nor was it until 1 859 that the claims of Great Britain were conceded by Honduras. British Honduras was originally attached to Jamaica, but has ranked as an independent colony since 1853. With regard to the rest of Central America, it was attached to the kingdom of Mexico from 1821 to 1823 ; then the states comprising it were formed into a Confederation, which fell to pieces in 1839, and the 5 states have since remained independent of each other. The E. coast of Nica ragua, occupied by the Mosquito Indians, was the seat of a native sovereignty under British protection for some years prior to 1860, when it was ceded to Nicaragua. Inter-Oceanic Communication. \u2014 Great attention has been drawn to Central America ( in the widest sense of the term as including the whole series of isthmuses between North and South America) in connection with the question of communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. A line of railway has already been made across the Isthmus of Panama (49 m.) between Aspinwall and the town of Panama by the course of the Chagres. Lines either of railway or canal have also been suggested at the following points : \u2014 (1) The Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Mexico, for a railway between Mina titlan and La Ventosa, distance about 130 m., summit level, 650 ft. (2) Honduras, for a railway, between Porto Cabello on the Bay of Honduras, and Fonseca Bay on the Pacific ; distance about 180 m. (3) Nicaragua, from the lake of Nicaragua in one direction to the Caribbean Gulf either by the river San Juan or by a railway cutting across from near Monkey Point by the course of the Rama : and in tlie other direction to the Pacific either directly at San Juan del Sur, or through lake Managua to Realejo or Fonseca Bay. (4) The Chiriqui lagune (a first-rate harbour on the Caribbean Sea), for a railway or canal to the mouth of the river David. (5) Limon Bay and Vaca del Monte Bay near Panama, for a canal parallel to the line of the present railway. (6) San Bias Bay and the Bayanos river, for a canal : only 15 m. between the tidal waters ; summit level, 800 ft. (7) Caledonia Bay and Darien Harbour, an inlet of San Miguel Bay, for a canal ; the summit level only 1 50 ft. State. Area in sq. m. Population. British Honduras . . Guatemala .... San Salvador ....

The difficulties of effecting water communication by any of these routes appear to be almost insuperable : railways are more possible, but unusual impediments to their construction are presented by the dense growth of the forests, the scarcity of labourers, the unhealthi ness of the climate, the hostility of the natives, and the distance from which materials and even provisions have to be conveyed. The pre sent Panama Ry. Co. possesses an exclusive right to make railways across the Isthmus of Panama, the limits of which are undefined. INDEX. I. Darien Harbour. in.

Natural Features\u2014 Climate and Productions. \u2014 The mountain system of Central America forms a distinct link in the spinal chord of the continent, being severed from the Andes by the depression at Panama and from the plateau of Anahuao by the depression at Tehuantepec. Between these limits there is a series of lofty plateaus, which rise sharply on the side of the Pacific and slope off towards the E., having their surfaces diversified with every variation of hill and plain. The highlands are divided by depres sions into 3 distinct masses, viz. ; the Plateau of Guatemala, with an average elevation of about 6000 ft. ; the Plateau of Honduras, about 4000 ft. ; and the Plateau of Costa Rica, about 2000 ft. The two last are divided by the remarkable transverse valley or depression in"], [584, "568 CENTRAL AMERICA. Book IV. which lie the Lakes of Nicaragua and Managua ; and the two first by the valleys of the Motagua, which joins the Bay of Honduras, and the Lempa, joining the Pacific, between the basins of which a ran<*e of moderate height is interposed. Volcanic force has been very active in this region : a long series of detached volcanoes skirts the base of the plateaus on the side of the Pacific between 10\u00b0 9' and 16\u00b0 2' N. lat. : 29 distinct summits have been reckoned, of which 18 are more or less active: the loftiest heights are at each extremity \u2014 in the N., the two volcanoes near Guatemala (above 13,000 ft.), and in the S., Irasu near Cartago (11,079 ft.), and Pioo Blanco (11,737). No less than 8 volcanoes lie in a line 64 m. long between the Lake of Managua and the Pacific. Coast-line and Harbours. \u2014 The E. coast i3 varied in its outline by the large rectangular protuberance which terminates in C. Gracias a Dios, to the W. of which the sea penetrates between it and the penin sula of Yucatan in the Bay of Honduras and its inmost recess Aiiia tique Bay. The stretch of coast on the N. side of Honduras is generally high, and on the E. side or the Mosquito shore low. The ports in the former direction are Puerto Cabello, the nearest point to Fonseca Bay on the Pacific, Omoa somewhat VV. of Cabello, and Truxillo in 85\u00b0 59' W. long., a fortified place. To the S. of C. Gracias a Dios the inlets are few : the chief ports are at the embouchures of the rivers Blewfields and San Juan, the former consisting of a lagune, and the latter of a bay enclosed by the promontory of Arenas. In British Honduras the river port of Belize is of moderate capacity. The Pacific coast offers excellent harbourage at the large inlet called Fonseca or Conchagua Gulf, the nearest point, as already noticed, to Puerto Cabello, and also easily accessible from Lake Managua by the line of the Estero Real. The other large inlets on this coast are the Gulf of Nicoya, on which are the ports of Puntas Arenas and Caldera (the latter unhealthy) belonging to Costa Rica, and the Gulf of Dulce. Of the lesser openings we may notice Salinas Bay, the nearest point to Lake Nicaragua, Elena Bay in the same neighbourhood, the small harbour of San Juan del Sur, Tamarinda, a small basin near Lake Managua, and Realejo farther W., a safe and roomy harbour. The seas opposite Lake Nicaragua are exposed to violent N.E. gales called Papagayos, which sweep through the dip in the highland from the Caribbean Sea. Rivers and Lakes. \u2014 The rivers of Central America are numerous, but of little avail for navigation from the rapidity of their courses. The most important is tlie San Juan, which serves as the emissary of Lake Nicaragua and offers the most promising line of navigation between the oceans : its course of 90 m. is, however, interrupted by rapids, and its depth is variable. Of the other rivers we may notice the Motagua, which joins the Bay of Honduras, the river variously called Vanks, Coco or Segovia, which reaches the eoast near C. Gracias a Dios, aud the Rio Escondido or Blewfields, more to the S. Of the lakes, the most important are the two already mentioned, Nicaragua, 120 m. long by about 55 m. broad, 128 ft. above the ocean, and Managua, lying in the same line and commuuicating with it, 55 m. long and 156 ft. above the ocean : both these lakes admit of being connected with the Pacific by canals, Nicaragua at Salinas Bay, Managua -jither at Tamarinds Realejo, or Fonseca Bay."], [585, "Chap. XXV. INHABITANTS \u2014 TOWNS. 569 Climate and Productions. \u2014 The description already given of the cli mate and productions of Mexico applies with some variation to Central America, which also has its Tierras Calientes, Templadas, and Frias, corresponding to the varying elevations of its surface. A marked differ ence, however, exists between the E. and W. coasts in regard to salu brity: the E. coast, being low and having more frequent rain, is unhealthy ; the Pacific coast, on the other hand, has its rainy season restricted to the summer months, and is generally more dry and healthy. The striking feature in the vegetation is the dense under growth of the forests during the summer, rendering them impenetrable without the constant use of the hatchet. The woods are very valuable, and include mahogany, logwood, Brazil-wood, cedar, copal-tree, rose-wood, fustic, lignum- vit\u00e6, &c. The cultivated crops are maize, sugar, cotton, tobacco, coffee (particularly in Costa Rica), indigo and rice ; the fruit trees include the plaintain, banana, pine-apple, orange, lemon, guava, and cocoa-nut ; and the vegetables, sarsaparilla, aloes, vanilla, cinchona (Peruvian bark), ipecacuanha, ginger, caoutchouc, &c. San Salvador has a specialty in the \" Balsam of Peru,\" produced from a tree growing on the coast. Minerals are abundant, and valuable gold mines have been opened in the Chontales district of Nicaragua by English capi talists. \u00a7 6. Inhabitants\u2014 Towns. \u2014 The population of Central America consists mainly of two classes \u2014 Indians, and Ladinoes or mixed races (Indian and Spanish): the whites are comparatively few, probably not above 100,000, and the negroes still fewer. The whites are proportionately most numerous in Costa Bica, and this state and San Salvador are more advanced and active than the others. The governments of the Bepublics are framed on the United States model, with a President and either one or two Legislative Chambers. Eoman Catholicism prevails in them. British Honduras has a Lieu tenant-Governor, an Executive Council, and a Legislative Assembly. The inhabitants are chiefly engaged in agricultural pursuits, in fell ing timber, and in the transport of produce to the seaboard. Timber forms the chief export : Costa Bica sends away much of the coffee grown there. Mining is not much followed by the natives. The amount of precious metal formerly extracted in these parts may be inferred from the name, Costa Bica, \" rich coast,\" given to it by the Spaniards in consequence of the gold and silver presented to them on landing in 1522. Towns. \u2014 The towns are comparatively large, the bulk of the population being gathered in them : they are arranged after the Spanish fashion : the better houses only are built of brick, the others of cane thatched with palm-leaves. The chief towns are : \u2014 in British Honduras, Belize (5000) on the river of the same name. In Guatemala, New Guatemala (40,000), the present capital, on the plateau at an elevation of 4372 ft., near two lofty volcanoes, founded in 1776, and having an active popu lation engaged in the manufacture of ornamental articles ; Old Guate mala (20,000 ), 20 m. to the S.W., the previous capital, founded in 1527, shattered by an earthquake in 1773; Quesaltenango (20,000), near the Mexican border, chiefly occupied by Indians ; Amatitlaa"], [586, "Book XXV. 570 THE WEST INDIES. (9000;, on a lake 18 m. S.E. of the capital, in a rich cochineal district. In San Salvador, San Salvador, on a plateau 2000 ft. high, newly built or in course of building in consequence of the destruc tion of the old capital of that name by a terrible earthquake in 1854 ; Sonsonate (8000), near the coast, on which it has the haibour of Acajutla ; and San Vicente (8000), on the Lempa. In Honduras, Comayagua (8000 1, centrally situated, and formerly having a much larger population ; and Tegucigalpa (12,000), said to be the most flourishing town of the state, S.E. of the capital, in a mining district. In Nica ragua, Leon (30,000) between Lake Managua and the sea, formerly the best-built city in Central America and still possessing a fine cathedral, but now much reduced by war ; Masaya (15,000), advantageously placed between the two great lakes; Managua (12,000) on the S. point of the lake of the same name; Granada (10,000) at the N. end, and Nicaragua or Rivas on the W. side of Lake Nicaragua ; and San Juan or Greytown, the port at the mouth of the San Juan. In Costa Rica, San Jose ( 16,000) at an elevation of 4500 ft. and surrounded by a rich coffee district ; Cartago (5000 ), the old capital, 16 m. S.E. of San Jose', shattered by an earthquake in 1841 ; and Alajuela (10,000), between the capital and the port of Puntas Arenas on the Gulf of Nieoya. Central America abounds with monumental antiquities similar to those in Mexico \u2014 pyramidal buildings, sculptured idols, walls, &c. At Copan, in northern Honduras, are the remains of a city extending 2 m., among which is the wall of a temple 624 ft. long ; at Quirigua, in the same region, but in the State of Guatemala, there are several sculptured monoliths of great size ; and at Opico in San Salvador there are extensive remains. III. The West Indies. \u00a7 7. Position \u2014 Divisions \u2014 Area and Population \u2014 Historical Geography. \u2014 The West Indies, in the most extended application of the term, are a series of islands extending in a horse-shoe form from the Peninsula of Florida to the Gulf of Maracaybo in South America. In a more restricted sense the name is applied to the islands from the Gulf of Paria, to the exclusion of those which run parallel to the coast of Venezuela between this and the Gulf of Maracaybo. The whole group is commonly divided into 3 sections : (1) The Greater Antilles,1 between Cuba and Porto Bico. (2) The Lesser Antilles, including all to the E. and S. of Porto Rico. (3) The Bahamas, which form a distinct line N. of the Greater Antilles, diverging towards the peninsula of Florida. The terms Leeward and \"Windward are applied with some variation to portions of the Antilles, in reference to their exposure to the Trade-winds.2 The Spaniards consistently apply the former expression (Barlo 1 The name Antilles appears to have been current among geographers before tbe discovery of the West Indies, and was applied to land supposed to he W. of the Azores. On the report of the discoveries of Columbus the new region was identified by Peter Martyr, writing in 1 193, with the rumoured Antilia. 2 A similar dl*tinction is occasionally made by the French with reference to the two (\u25a0ides of an individual isle \u2014 Grimde-terie and Basse-tare, the latter being the sheltered, and apparently tlie hsu land."], [587, "Chap. XXV. DIVISIONS \u2014 POPULATION. 571 viento) to the sheltered islands along the Venezuelan coast, and \" Windward \" to the exposed line of islands from Trinidad to Porto Rico. Our navigators, on tbe other hand, apply the two terms to sections of this latter line, \" Windward \" to the islands S. of Dominica, and \"Leeward\" to those between Dominica and Porto Rico. Occasionally we find the \" \"Windward \" series carried on to Porto Rico, and \" Leeward \" applied to the Greater Antilles : but this is not the prevailing usage. The total area of the islands (including those off the Venezuelan coast) is 93,650 sq. m., and the population 3,970,604. The islands, arranged according to their groups, are as follow : \u2014 1. Greater Antilles \u2014 Cuba, the \"Queen of the Antilles,\" Hayti or St. Domingo, Jamaica, and Porto Kico. 2. Lesser Antilles. (1) Leeward or North Caribbean \u2014 Virgin Islands, Santa Cruz, Anguilla, St. Martin, St. Bartholomew, Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Chris topher or St. Kitts, Nevis, Barbuda, Antigua, Montserrat, Guade loupe, Desiderada or Desirade, Marie Galante, Les Saintes, Dominica. (2) Windward or South Caribbean \u2014 Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Barbados, the Grenadines, Grenada, Tobago, Trinidad. (3) Venezuelan \u2014 Margarita, Tortuga, Buen Ayre, Curasao, Oruba. 3. Bahamas. \u2014 Bahama, Abaco, Andros, New Providence, Eldu tliera, St.. Salvador, Long Island. The areas and populations of the larger islands are as follow : \u2014 Historical Geography.\u2014 The West Indian Islands were discovered, as already stated, by Columbus. The isle on which he lauded and to which he gave the name of San Salvador, was probably Watling, and not Cat Island, as has generally been supposed. The names of the islands contain many memorials of their discoverer, his country, and his religion\u2014 St. Christopher being so named after his own Christian name, Espanola1 as the Spanish land of the New World, Dominica as having been discovered on a Sunday (dies dominica) and St. Vincent on St. Vincent's day, Montserrat from its resemblance to the moun tain of that name in the N.E. of Spain, Guadeloupe after the famous monastery in Estremadura, Grenada the French form of Granada, the Virgin Isles in honour of tbe 11,000 virgins commemorated by the Eoman Church, aud Trinidad, in honour of the Holy Trinity and in accordance with a vow made during a violent storm that he would so ' This name, applied to Hayti, has been corrupted into Hispaniola and then explained Little Spain.\" T\u00a3 Population- Cuba 45,882 1,396,530 Hayti 28,031 708,500 Jamaica 6,400 441.264 Porto Rico .... 3,596 538,308"], [588, "Cook IV. 572 THE WEST INDIES. name the first land he sighted. The Greater Antilles were occupied by the Spaniards in a few years after their discovery ; the Lesser Antilles not until a considerably later period and by various nations ; Trinidad, by the Spaniards in 1588 ; Barbados, St. Kitts, Anguilla, Nevis, Antigua, and Montserrat, by the British in the early part of the 17th cent. ; Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, St. Lucia, and Gre nada by the French about the same period. St. Vincent retained its independence until 1779, when the natives submitted to France. Tobago was first occupied permanently by Courlanders and Dutch about tbe middle of the 17th cent. The Virgin Islands were taken possession of by buccaneers : these were expelled from Tortola by the English in 1666, and from St. Thomas, St. John, and Santa Cruz by the Danes about 1672. The changes that have occurred in the ownership of the islands have been chiefly in favour of Great Britain, which acquired Jamaica from Spain in 1655 ; the sole possession of Domi nica in 1759, that island having previously been occupied jointly by English, French, and Spaniards ; Grenada, St. Vincent, and Tobago from France in 1763; Trinidad from Spain in 1797; and St. Lucia from France in 1803. These islands were afterwards recovered temporarily by France, and some of them more than once. The United States acquired St. Thomas and St. John by purchase in 1867. The only island which has an independent history is Hayti : about 1650 French buccaneers gained a footing in the W. of that island, and in 1697 this part was duly ceded to France by Spain. On the outbreak of the French Revolution the negroes of the French part were declared free ; they expelled the French and proclaimed the independence of Hayti in 1801: a series of revolutions have since occurred in that unhappy State. The Spanish portion of the island, distinguished as St. Domingo, has been at times united with Hayti, but generally has asserted its inde pendence, which it still retains. \u00a7 8. Natural Features \u2014 Climate and Productions. \u2014 The West Indian islands appear to be the summits of ranges belonging to a submarine plateau connecting North and South America in the E., just as the plateaus of Central America do in the W. Viewed in relation to the adjacent regions, the Lesser Antilles run in the same direction as the great dorsal chains of the continent, and the Greater Antilles in a transverse direction, parallel to the range of Caracas in Venezuela. Thus the two lines form two sides of a rectangle, inclosing with the continent the Caribbean sea. The Bahamas form an outer line converging towards the Greater An tilles and running closely parallel to the Lesser Antilles, so forming a double series as far S. as Guadeloupe, beyond which the sole repre sentative of the line is the outlying island of Barbados. This outer line differs in geological formation and in aspect from the inner one, being either calcareous or coral, and generally low. This is the case most notably with the Bahamas, which rarely rise more than 6 ft. above high-water mark, and are surrounded by banks of coral, of which they are only the slightly elevated protuberances ; it is also the case with Anguilla, Barbuda, Antigua, and Barbados, which are flat and low as compared with their neighbours. The western part"], [589, "Chap. xxv. natural features. 573 of Cuba participates also in this character, being calcareous, compa ratively low, and surrounded by a submarine bank. The main range (if we may so term it) of the Greater Antilles, has its central knot in Hayti (the \" rocky \" island, as the name means), where the Hoo de Taque, the culminating point of tho Cibao range, rises to 7000 ft. To the W. the line of elevation forks off, the N. arm re appearing in the lofty range of Cobre (7200 ft.) in the S.E. of Cuba, and the S. arm in the Blue Mts. (7150 ft.), which form the dorsal chain of Jamaica. E. of Hayti the range re-appears in Porto Bico and the Virgin Islands, some of which, as Tortola, St. John, and Virgin Gorda, are very mountainous. Here the line is met from the S. hy a chain of volcanic summits, commencing with St. Eustatius and terminating in Grenada; the most conspicuous peaks being Mt. Misery (4454 ft.) on St. Kitts, the Souflriere (5113 ft.) on Guadeloupe, the Morne Diablotin (5318 ft.) on Dominica, and Mont Pelee (4706 ft.) ou Martinique. Most of the craters are dormant; but eruptions of lava have taken place on St. Vincent in 1718 and 1812, and of pumice on Guadeloupe in 1797, 1836, and 1837, aud hot springs are periodically filled on St. Lucia. The south ernmost island. Trinidad, consists of 3 high ranges, running in the direction of the Caracas range, between which the alluvium of the Orinoco has been deposited. The dorsal chain of Tobago appears to be a continuation of the N. range of Trinidad. The islands are generally very picturesque, luxuriant forests climbing to the highest summits. The Blue Mts. of Jamaica, and the southern of the Lesser Antilles from Dominica to Trinidad, afford as beautiful scenery as is to be found in the world. The rivers are numerous and violent on most of the islands, but necessarily have short courses and need no special notice. Climate and Productions. \u2014 AVith the exception of the northern Baha mas, the West Indies lie within the Tropics. The normal temperature is therefore high (about 78\u00b0) ; but the modifying influences are various aud powerful, such as the proximity of the sea, the altitude of the central parts of the islands, the trade winds, and the daily sea-breezes. The temperature is generally equable, amounting at Kingston to only 5\u00b0 difference between the means of summer and winter : in the N. of Cuba, however, the thermometer has a greater range, and occasionally descends to 45\u00b0. The dry season in the West Indies occurs between November and March : the wet season prevails at intervals for tbe remainder of the year, being most heavy and general in August and September, and at other periods varying according to the position^ of the islands in reference to the sun's course, the southern islands having a longer period of rain in the spring months than the northern ones, and it being generally dry in each island as the sun attains the zenith over it. The rainfall amounts to an average of about 60 inches, and is greatest in the southern islands. The N.E. trade-winds prevail from November to March, and the S.W. trade-winds from March till June ; then comes a season of calms to be succeeded during the heavy"], [590, "574 THE WEST INDIES. Book IV. rains by irregular and violent gusts. Hurricanes or cyclones occur in this latter season, and are most terrible in their effects, sweeping away the standing crops, unroofing houses, and rendering vessels utterly un manageable. Trinidad and Tobago are exempt from these visitations. Earthquakes also are of frequent occurrence. The vegetation of the West Indies is most luxuriant : the forests are extensive, the trees of fine growth, and their timber valuable for building and cabinet-making. The cotton-tree and fig-tree attain to grand dimensions, and the papau and palmetto to a great height ; we may further specify the mahogany, log-wood, iron-wood, and lignum vit\u00e6. The fruit-trees and vegetables include the breadfruit-tree, mango, plaintain, yam, avocado pear, all spice plant (myrtus pimento), custard-apple, guava, cocoa-tree, orange, &c. Of the cultivated crops the sugar-cane stands first as the specialty of the West Indies, having been introduced by the Portuguese from the Canaries : the coffee-plant was also imported by them : tobacco, both the plant and the name, is indigenous, but whether the island Tobago is named after the Indian word for the tobacco-pipe, or the plant named after the island, is doubtful : maize is the usual cereal: indigo, ginger, rice, cacao, and manioc are also cultivated. The larger animals which occupied the islands when the Spaniards arrived, are now extinct with the exception of the wild boar. The turtle is the only animal exported. Insects (fire-flies, mosquitoes, &c.) and birds (parrots, humming-birds, mocking-birds, &c.) are very numerous, ; and alligators infest the rivers. Copper has been largely won from the Cobre Mts. in Cuba : lead and other minerals also exist, but not in such quantities as to attract attention. Coal has been discovered on some of the islands on Cuba near Havanah, on Hayti, and on Trinidad. There are bituminous springs on Barbados and deposits of phosphate of lime on Anguilla. \u00a7 9. Inhabitants \u2014 Towns, &c\u2014 The native population of the West Indies was ruthlessly extirpated by the Spaniards on the islands of the Greater Antilles. They are described as a mild and amiable people, maintaining a patriarchal form of government under caziques or tribal chieftains. The Lesser Antilles were occupied by a fiercer race \u2014 the Caribs \u2014 who offered a sturdy resistance to the invaders, and held their ground in the more inaccessible parts ofthe islands for varying periods. On St. Vincent they became inter- mingled with negroes and were known as Black Caribs : these harassed the British settlers down to 1797, when they were deported to the island of Buatan in Honduras Bay. A few Carib families still exist on the southern islands. The present population consists of whites, negroes, and mulattoes or mixed races. The proportions of these elements vary : in the British ' possessions the Whites are pro- bably not more than 1-1 7th of the whole : in the Spanish posses- sions the whites are more than a half. The relative proportions of the negroes and the mulattoes cannot be .generally stated; in Jamaica the negroes are 4 times and in Cuba 3 times as numerous as the mulattoes. In the Spanish possessions about 700,000 negroes ' The returns of 1861 gave 51,097 whites out of a total of 933,847 ; but this does not include the whites in Monts-Trat, Dominica, and Grenada."], [591, "Chap. XXV. INHABITANTS \u2014 GOVERNMENT. 575 are in a state of slavery : elsewhere they are free. Since the eman cipation the negro has become very indolent, easily satisfying his wants with the fruits that grow abundantly about him, and so becoming independent of all work. The planters are consequently introducing coolies from India and China. The mulattoes are inferior to the negroes in physical and to the whites in intellectual capacity ; but, on the other hand, they are superior to the negroes intellectually, and are more adapted to the climate than the whites ; they may, therefore, possibly be destined to become the dominant race in these parts. The languages are generally in accordance with the ownership of the islands : but in the English islands of Trinidad, St. Lucia, and Dominica, French is the prevailing language. Government. \u2014 With the exception of Hayti, the \"West Indian islands are subject to other states in the following proportions: \u2014 The British possessions comprise Jamaica, the Bahamas, Trinidad, Dominica, Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada, Antigua, Tobago, Montserrat, Nevis, Barbuda, the majority of the Virgin Islands, and some lesser islands. Spain owns Cuba, Porto Rico, and the islands adjacent to each ; France, Guadeloupe, with its dependencies (Marie Galante, Les Saintes, Desirade, and half of St. Martin), and Martinique ; the Netherlands, St. Eustatius, Saba, half of St. Martin, Curasao, Oruba, and Buen Ayre ; the United States, St. Thomas and St. John ; Denmark, Santa Cruz ; and Sweden, St. Bartholomew. The English possessions are governed by representatives of the Crown, who are entitled Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, or Presi dent, according to the importance of their commands. Most of the larger islands, with St. Kitts and Nevis, have representative institutions in the form of a double chamber, the upper one entitled the Legisla tive Council, the lower one the House of Assembly. Trinidad and St. Lucia, with the lesser islands, Anguilla, Montserrat, the Virgin Islands, the Turks aud Caicos,1 have only tbe Legislative Council with out the House of Assembly. Barbuda has an exceptional position, being the property of the Codrington family. Agriculture\u2014 Commerce, &c \u2014 The British Colonies in the West Indies have received severe shocks to their prosperity in the present century, first through the emancipation of the slaves in 1834, and secondly through the removal of the protective duties on sugar in 1845.

THE WEST INDIES. sugar-cane, have returned to a state of nature or are occupied by the provision grounds of the negroes. The produce of sugar has fallen off from about lj million cwt. before 1830 to between 600,000 and 700,000 cwt. in 1860. The indolence of the negroes is the main cause of this diminution. Barbados, whose surface is so cultivated that the negroes must either work or starve, has always kept up its production, and is now the most flourishing of the islands. Moreover, coolies have been largely introduced here and in Trinidad, and these islands have prospered proportionately. The French islands, Guadeloupe aud Martinique, are more productive and better kept than the majority of the English ones. The Spanish colonies have prospered on the decay of the British, inasmuch as they have retained their supply of slave-labour : Cuba produces a very large amount of sugar, tobacco, and coffee. Throughout all the islands, farming for cereals and live- stock is quite a subordinate branch of agriculture ; maize is the ordi- nary cereal : flour is largely imported into Cuba and other islands from the United States : cattle are very numerous on the unenclosed Savannahs of Cuba, and are found in sufficient quantities on the other islands. The manufactures of the West Indian isles are confined to the conversion of their own staple products into sugar, rum, and cigars. These articles also form their chief exports, together with coffee, cacao, indigo, mahogany and other woods, pimento, arrow-root, and tropical fruits. The trade is carried on with England, tbe United States, Spain, France, and Germany. The passenger traffic is chiefly maintained by French and English companies : the rendezvous for the intercolonial packets has hitherto been at St. Thomas's, one of the Virgin Islands, whence the Trans- Atlantic boats start. Towns. \u2014 The West Indian towns are mostly to be found on the coast, the larger islands alone having a sufficient area for inland towns of any size. In the Lesser Antilles the most sheltered and enclosed bays are on the W. side of the islands, and here accordingly are the chief towns. The Havanah (La Habaiia=\"the harbour\") may be termed the metropolis of the West Indies ; it stands on the N. coast of Cuba, directly in the track of vessels navigating the Strait of Florida from the Atlantic ports of the United States ; its harbour, though somewhat difficult of access, is large, deep, and defended by fortresses : the streets are narrow and dirty, and the chief objects are the Cathedral, in which repose the remains of Columbus, and the Paseo or public drive : its population is about 200,000. Of the other Cuban towns we may notice Matanzas (36,102), a rising port, about 50 m. E. of Havanah ; Santiago (36,752), the chief port of the S.E., and once the capital of the whole island; and Puerto Principe (30,688), the largest inland town, centrally situated and communicating by a railway with its port Las Nuevitas, 36 m. distant, on the N. coast. There are also harbours at Jagua, Cien-fuegos, and Trinidad on the S. coast. A railway intersects the W. central district between Havanah and Cien- fuegos, branching off to Matanzas and Cardenas on the N. coast. In Jamaica, Kingston (32,000) is the commercial entrepot, its harbour con sisting of a basin or lagune, formed by a long sandy spit, which serves as a natural breakwater, and on the end of which is seated the naval station of Port Eoyal (15,000). The seat of government is at Spanish Town, 10 m. W. of Kingston, with a railway between them. Jamaica also possesses good harbours at Port Morant and Old Harbour on its S. coast, Lucea and Port Antonio on its N. coast. Hayti possesses first-rate, but little frequented, ports at C. Haytien on the N. coast. St. Nioholas at"], [593, "Chap. XXV. THE BERMUDAS. 577 the N.W. angle, Samana Bay in the N.E., Cayes in the S.W., Port au-Prince on the W. coast, and Goave, about 50 m. W. of Port-au- Prince. Port-au-Prince is the capital of the Western, and San Domingo of the Eastern division of this island : the latter was founded by Co lumbus and is the oldest of the existing West Indian towns. In Porto Rico the harbour of San Juan (15,367) lies between the peninsula ou which the town stands and the mainland, and is thus sheltered from the heavy surf that beats on this N. shore during northerly gales : the island has fine harbours at Guayama and Ponce on the S. coast, and a convenient roadstead at Aguadilla in the N.W. angle. In the Lesser Antilles, Charlotte Amalie (10,000), on St. Thomas, is the head station of the English steam-packets. Antigua has good ports at St. John's (14,000), its capital, on the N. coast, and English Harbour, on the S. coast. The capital of Guadeloupe, Basseterre (4900), has only an ex posed roadstead, and the best harbour is at Pointe-a-Pitre (20,000) which is unhealthy and short of fresh water. Dominica, again, has only a roadstead at its capital Roseau (5000) and a sheltered harbour at Prince Eupert Bay ; the same may be said of Martinique, which has a good harbour at Fort Eoyal (12,000), and a roadstead only at St. Pierre (23,000), which is nevertheless the most active and best-built of the towns in the Lesser Antilles. Port Castries (2400) on St. Lucia, has a most spacious basin. Bridgetown (21,384) the capital of Barbados, is situated on Carlisle Bay, which lies open to the W., but is the best, if not the only available harbour on the island. Kingstown and St. George, the capitals of St. Vincent and Grenada respectively, are poor places. There is a fine natural harbour at Bequia. one of the Grena dines. Tobago abounds with fine bays (King's Bay, Man-of-War Bay, &c), but its capital, Scarborough, is a small place. Trinidad is equally well provided, the whole Gulf of Paria, between the horns of the island, being little else than a grand harbour approached from the N. by the passage of the Dragon's Mouth and from the S. by the Serpent's Mouth: the capital, Port of Spain (11,693), faces this gulf, and seems destined to be one of the first cities of the West Indies. Nassau, on New Providence, is the capital of the Bahamas. \u00a7 10. The Bermudas are a group of 300 or more islands stretching for a length of 20 m. and a breadth of 3 m., about 32\u00b0 3C N. lat., 60\u00b0 3(y W. long. ; area 24 sq. m., and population 11,451, of whom 4625 are whites. The islands are chiefly of coral formation ; surrounded by reefs which make the navigation somewhat dangerous ; provided with fair harbourage ; surface low and flat, and covered with stunted cedar-trees and oleanders ; the climate mild and equable, but re- laxing ; soil fertile, producing first-rate arrowroot, and abundant crops of barley, oats, and maize. About 12 of the islands are inha- bited, but the bulk of the population is collected on 3 of them, viz. : St. George, which is strongly fortified and has a town of the same name; Long Island or Bermuda (the 'continent,' as the people call it from its preponderating size), on which is Hamilton, the residence of the Governor; and Ireland, on which is a dockyard and other government works. The value of Bermuda to Great Britain would be very great in the event of a war with the United States. 2 c MOD. GEO."], [594, "578 Chimborazo and the Andes. CHAPTER XXVI. SOUTH AMERICA. KEW GRANADA.

Boundaries \u2014 Dimensions \u2014 Area and Population \u2014 Coast-line. \u2014 South America, as a natural division, commences at the southern extremity of the Isthmus of Darien ; but, inasmuch as the series of isthmuses from Darien to Chiriqui are included in New Granada, it is necessary to carry the limits of South America, as a political division, to 83\u00b0 \"VV. long. In other directions the continent is bounded by the sea, viz., N., by the Caribbean Sea ; E., by the Atlantic ; and W., by the Pacific. In the S., the Strait of Magellan forms the limit of the mainland ; but in this direction the continent may be held to include the large archipelago of which Tierra del Fuego is the principal member. The continent extends through 682 degrees of latitude between Gallinas Point, 12\u00b0 25' N., and Cape Horn, 56\u00b0 S. ; and through 46i degrees of longitude be tween Parahiba, 34\u00b0 50\", and Parina Point, 81' 18' W. long. Its shape approximates to a right-angled triangle, of which the right angle is situated E. at Parahiba. The extreme length of the con-"], [595, "Chap. XXVI. SOUTH AMERICA \u2014 COAST-LINE. ETC. 579 tinent is about 4800 m. ; its extreme breadth about 3000 m. ; its area 6,959,865 sq. m. ; and its population 24,294,000. Coast-hne\u2014Bays and Promontories.\u2014 The coast-line of South America is less indented than that of any other continent ; but the effect of this regularity is counterbalanced by the great length of the seaboard, the tapering form of the continent, and the vast size of some of the estuaries. There is not a single inclosed sea of any size : the most im portant is the Gulf of Maracaybo, on the N. coast, which, taken in conjunction with the lake of the same name, penetrates deeply into the land: the Gulf of Darien, on the same coast, is the most southerly angle of the Caribbean Sea, aud has high and rocky coasts ; the Gulf of Paria is enclosed seawards by the island of Trinidad. The mouths of the Orinoco and the Amazons supply important openings on the N.E. section of the coast. The E. coast exhibits no striking irregularity until we reach the large estuary of the Eio de la Plata : to the N. of this the inlets are small, though extremely valuable for harbourage, such as the enclosed bays of Bahia and Eio de Janeiro : to the S. of it the coast-line loses its regularity and presents several open bays, Buch as those of San Matias and St. George. The Strait of Magellan, or, more correctly, Magelhaens, is a tortuous channel between Tierra del Fuego and the mainland, divided into two sections by the southerly projection which terminates in C. Froward, the easterly section con sisting of broad expanses connected by straits, and the westerly one of a narrow elongated channel separating Clarence Island and Desola tion Land from the mainland. The western coast is remarkably regular between the 6th and 42nd parallels S. lat.; the sections on either side of this are more varied, the southern one remarkably so, being fretted with fiords and skirted throughout with islands and narrow tortuous channels: the chief openings from the ocean to the coast are the G. of Trinidad, between Madre and Wellington islands ; the G. of Pefias, between Wellington island aud the Taytao peninsula, and the Chonos Gulf between Chonos and Chiloe. The northern section contains the G. of Guayaquil, and some less important openings, such as the Bay of Choco aud Cupica Bay. The spacious Gulf of Panama, with its sub ordinate inlets Parita Bay, Panama Bay enclosed by the Pearl Islands, and the Gulf of St, Miguel, beloDgs rather to Central than to South America. The most important headlands in South America are C. San Roque at the E. angle, C. Frio on the E. coast in 23\u00b0 S. lat., C. Corrientes S. of the La Plata, C. Pillar at the W. entrance of the Strait of Magellan, and Cape Horn or, more properly, Hoorn (so named after the Dutch town of Hoorn, the native place of the navigator Schouten), on the most southerly island of the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago. \u00a7 2. Configuration \u2014 Mountains and Plains \u2014 The Andes. \u2014The surface of South America is unequally divided between mountains and plains, in the proportion of l-4th of the former to 3-4ths of the latter. The mountains consist of the long spinal chain of the Andes on the W. side of the continent in close proximity to the Pacific coast, and of a few detached groups of mountains elsewhere, the most important of which are the Brazilian Mts. in the eastern protuberance of the continent between the basins of the La Plata and the Amazons, and the Parime Mts. between the Amazons 2 c 2"], [596, "580 SOUTH AMERICA.

MOUNTAINS AND PLAINS. 581 connected by intervening ridges with the Andes system. The plains stretch away from the E. declivity of the Andes to tho highlands of Brazil aud Paring, and between these and on either side of them to the Atlantic Ocean. They are thus divided into 4 great sections, viz., a westerly plain along the foot of the Andes, where the basins of the great rivers Orinoco, Amazons, and La Plata are blended together, or are at least separated by imperceptible swells of the ground ; and 3 easterly ones, the most northerly being the basin of the lower Orinoco between the Venezuela and Parim^ Mts. ; the central one, the basin of the Amazons between the Faring and Brazilian Mts. ; and the southerly one, extending from the Brazilian Mts. to the extremity of the continent, and containing the basins of the La Plata, Bio Negro, and other rivers. The names ' Llanos ' and ' Pampas ' applied to the plains of the lower Orinoco and the La Plata,1 are general designations of a 'plain' in the Spanish and Indian (Quichua) tongues respectively : the ' Selvas ' of the Amazons are the 'forest' plains as distinguished from the grassy or treeless plains. The flatness of the South American plains is very remarkable. The Llanos rise only 192 ft. in 450 m. from the sea; and an elevation of the sea-level to the extent of 1100 ft. would submerge the plains to the foot of the Andes. The Llanos indeed present every appearance of being the dry bed of an ancient ocean gulf, their wonderful uniformity and smoothness being interrupted only by slightly elevated platforms or ' banks ' (as they are still called), similar to what are to be found in the ocean-bed. The extent of the plains is such that a country of the size of France might be lost in the Selvas of the Amazons : and their continuity such that a person might travel over them from the Caribbean sea to the Strait of Magellan. The Andes. \u2014 1. General Characteristics. \u2014 The Andes are in many respects the most remarkable mountain-system in the world. The following points deserve attention: \u2014 (1.) Their continuity. They stretch in an unbroken line from the Isthmus of Darien to the inlet of Ancon Sin Salida in 52\u00b0 S. lat., and are clearly traceable to the S. of this in the detached masses which form the western and southern rim of the archipelago of Tierra del Fuego down to Cape Horn in tbe W. and Cape Good Success in the E., the total distance being thus about 4500 m. The term ' cordillera ' ( = chain) is hence peculiarly appropriate to the Andes system. (2.) Their elevation. The mean elevation is 11,830 ft., which, though by no means equal to that of Himalaya, is yet wonderful when the immense length of the line is taken into account. (3.) Their tendency to parallelism. This feature is ob servable throughout the whole of the Central Andes from 35\u00b0 S. lat. to 1\u00b0 30' N. lat. ; in the Northern Andes the parallelism is less marked 1 Pampa is by no means confined to the laga and the Yucayali, and the term also La Plata plains : we hear of the Pampas \u25a0 appears in composition in the softened del Sacramento in Peru, between the Hual- form \" bamta,\" as in Cocha-barnba."], [598, "582 SOUTH AMERICA. Book IV and divergence sets in : in the Southern Andes, where there is only a single crest-range, the parallelism is maintained in the subordinate line of heights on the islands which skirt the coast. (4.) The frequency of high longitudinal valleys and inclosed basins between the parallel chains, many of which are occupied by a comparatively thick population at altitudes unprecedented in other parts of the world. (5.) The fre quent occurrence of mountain-ltnots or broad transverse belts con necting the parallel ranges, subdividing the highlands into enclosed basins and themselves forming plateaus of very great elevation. (6.) The depth of the transverse valleys which run up from the plains to the central region, those of Chota and Cutaco having perpendicular sides of 4875 ft. and 4225 ft. respectively. (7.) The number of volcanoes, either dormant or active. There are 3 linear groups, separated by long intervals, the central one (Peru and Bolivia) between 16J\u00b0 and 21J\u00b0 S. lat., the southern (Chili) between 30\u00b0 5' and 46\u00b0 8' S. lat., and the northern (New Granada and Ecuador) between 2\u00b0 S. lat. and 5\u00b0 7' N. lat. The interval between the first and the second is 540 m. and between the first and third 9 GO in. The number of active craters is estimated at 24 and of dormant craters at 32. 2. Natural and political divisions. \u2014 The Andes may be divided naturally into 3 sections, corresponding to the broad differences in the conformation of the chain, as consisting: \u2014 (1) of a single line to the S. of 35\u00b0 S. lat. ; (2) of two or more parallel lines, between 35\u00b0 S. and 1\u00b0 30' N. lat. ; and (3) of diverging lines to the N. of 2\u00b0 5'. But the more usual division is borrowed from the names of the countries through which the chain passes, as follows : \u2014 (1.) Tlie Andes of Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia. \u2014 These consist of rugged and irregular, but not highly elevated ranges, interrupted by fiords and channels, especially by the Strait of Magellan, culminating S. of that strait in Mt. Sarmiento (6900 ft.) in the W. of Tierra del Fuego, and N. of the strait in Minchinmadon or Minchinmadava (8000 ft.) in 42\u00b0 46' S. lat. This section may be considered to terminate at the comparatively low pass of Boquete (2794 ft.) between Lakes Todos Santos and Nahuel Huapi, the reservoir of the river Negro. (2.) The Andes of Chili, \u2014 These extend from the 41st to the 22nd parallel, at au average distance of 100 m. from the coast, and increasing in elevation as they proceed N. The parallelism begins to develope itself about 35\u00b0 in the two chains which enclose the high longitudinal valleys of Tunuyan and Uspallata, the eastern range being the highest of the two at the points where they are crossed by the Portillo pass (14,365 ft.) out of the former, and the Cuinbre pass (12,572 ft.) out of the latter, the two most frequented passes on the route between Santiago and Buenos Ayres. This portion of the Chilian Andes contains several very lofty peaks, particularly Aconcagua 1 2 1,910 ft.) in 32\u00b0 39', Tupungato (22,301 ft.) in 33\u00b0 22', and Maypu (17,662 ft.) in 34\u00b0 17'. Higher up (29\u00b0-28\u00b0) three ranges may be noticed, viz.: the main Andes, Famatina, and Velasco, with the valleys of Guandacol between the first and second, and Famatina between the second and third. Still higher (28\u00b0-23\u00b0^ a broad plateau region projects eastward to a width of 350 m., buttressed S.E. by the ranges of Aconcagua aud the Despoblado Andes, and having an elevation of about 13,000 ft. \u2014 a rugged and barren region, well meriting its title of Despoblado, ' un iuhabited.' On each side of this broad excrescence of the Andes system the surface descends by terraces to the lower levels. On the E. may be noticed the terrace of Rioja, which extends to the mountains of"], [599, "Chap. XXVI. THE ANDES. 583 Cordova, the terrace of Salta below the Despoblado Andes, of Tucuman at a still lower level, and of Yavi in the extreme E. between the rivers Jujuy and Tarija. On the W. the slope of the Andes reaches to the sea, and is on this side also of a sterile character \u2014 the desert of Atacama. (3.) The Andes of Peru and Bolivia. \u2014 These extend between the 22nd and 4th parallels, and contain table-lands of great elevation. From the 22nd parallel the broad mass of highlands noticed in the preceding paragraph is continued to the 20th parallel ; but to the N. of this it gradually contracts and the chain resolves itself again into two well-defined parallel ranges, which contain some of the grandest heights of the whole system. The Western or Coast range has a medium height of about 15,000 ft., and descends sharply on the side of the Pacific, leaving a maritime plain from 20 to 50 m. wide. The volcanic peaks in this range are very numerous ; we may particularly notice a group of 4 lying -within 30 m. between 18\u00b0 25' and 18\u00b0 7', viz.: Bahama (22.350 ft.), Pomarape (21,700 ft.), Parinaoota (22,033 ft.), and Gualateiri (21,960 ft.): more N. are the cones of Arequipa (20,3u0 ft.), in 16\u00b0 20', with an active crater, and Chuquibamba (21,000 ft.), in 15\u00b0 50'. The Eastern Cordillera attains its greatest elevation between the 17th and 15th parallels in the culminating point of the whole range,* Sorata (24,812 ft.): it also contains IUimani (21,149 ft.) and other conspicuous summits. The two ranges are united by mountain-knots at the following points : \u2014 In the S. between 22\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 S. lat. by the mass of mountains variously described as the Andes of San Christoval or the Plateau of Potosi ; between 15\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 by the mountain-knot of Cuzco: between 11\u00b0 and 10\u00a3\u00b0 by the mountain-knot of Pasco; and iu 4\u00b0 by the mountain knot of Loja. The most important of the high basins in this part of the Andes is that of the Desaguedero, between the Plateau of Potosi and the mountain-knot of Cuzco, having a length of 400 m., an area of 20,000 sq. m., and a mean elevation of 12,900 ft., and con taining Lakes Titicaca and Aullagas. The passes between the sea-coast and the Titicaca basin are much frequented, inasmuch as they afford the most practicable routes to the interior of Bolivia ; they are, never theless, sufficiently difficult, attaining generally a height of 15,500 ft. and upwards. We may mention the Altos de Toledo in 16\u00b0 2', Los Huescos close to the peak of Arequipa, the lowest of the passes (13,573 ft.), Gualillas in 17\u00b0 50', and Lagunillas near 15\u00b0. To the N. of the mountain-knot of Cuzco the plateau breaks up into 3 ridges, in closing the upper valleys of the Urubamba in the E. and the Apurimac : the town of Cuzco stands atan elevation of 11,380ft. The plateau or mountain-knot of Pasco rises to 16,000 ft. and the mining town of Cerro de Pasco is at an altitude of 13,720 ft. N. of this mountain knot the plateau again breaks up into 3 ridges inclosing the upper valleys ofthe Huallaga and the Maranon. (4.) Tlie Andes of Ecuador.\u2014 These extend in two parallel lines about 40 m. apart, between the mountain-knots of Loja in 4\u00b0 S. and Los Pastos in 1\u00b0 N. lat., a distance of about 450 m. The elongated valley so inclosed is subdivided by transverse ridges into the 3 basins of Cuenca (7800 ft.), Alausi, otherwise called La Tapia or Hambato 2 The elevation of Sorata, according to I measurement.

Book IV. (8500 ft.), and Quito (9600 ft.). The basin of Quito is. the most im portant of these, having a length of 200 m. and a breadth of 30 m., and being the very heart of the state of Ecuador. Though the plain itself is at an elevation of nearly 10,000 ft., it is surrounded by a series of magnificent volcanic peaks, of which we may notice in the eastern Cordillera Cotopaxi (18,875 ft.), Antisana (19,137 ft.), and Cayambe (19,535 ft.), the first of matchless beauty, particularly as it appears by night when the glare from its crater lights up its snow-clad summit ; and in the western Cordillera the mighty Chimborazo (21,422 ft.), Hinitza ( 1 7,380 ft.), and Pichincha (1 5,936 ft. ), which overhangs the town of Quito. Another important summit, Sanguay (16,027 ft.), lies in the eastern Cordillera, where it bounds the Alausi basin, in 2\u00b0 S. lat. An important route traverses the 3 basins, attaining an elevation of 15,520 ft. at the pass of Assuay, N. of Cuenca. (5.) Tlie Andes of New Granada. \u2014 These branch off from the moun tain-knot of Los Pastos into 3 divergent arms, of which the central one retains the general direction ofthe chain, going N.E. between the valleys of the rivers Cauca and Magdalena, and having a mean elevation of 12,000 ft. in its southern part with a culminating height of 18,315 ft. in Tolima, 4\u00b0 53' N. lat. The range is crossed by two very difficult, yet much frequented routes \u2014 one by the pass of Guanacas (14,700 ft.) between Popayan and La Plata; and the other by that of QuiDdiu (11,493 ft.) between Bogota and Cartago. The western branch runs on the 1. or W. side of the Cauca and subdivides about 5^\u00b0 N. lat. into two ranges, one of which follows the eoast, while the other runs between the basins of the Cauca and Atrato. The eastern branch separates the basins of the Magdalena and Orinoco ; this also bifurcates in 5\u00b0 N. lat., sending one arm N. between the Lake of Maracaybo and the river Magdalena, while the other continues E. to the junction of the Venezuela coast-ranges in 69\u00b0 W. long. The plateau of Bogota stands on a western terrace of the undivided portion of the eastern branch at an elevation of 8958 ft. \u00a7 3. Hydrography. \u2014 South America is distinguished, above even North America, by the great size of its river-basins. The three largest of these occupy about 4 millions of sq. m., or nearly l-6th of the whole area of the continent : one of the three, the Orinoco basin, is small as compared with the others, the La Plata being about 4 times as large, and tbe Amazons about 8 times as large. These 3 basins blend, as bas been already described, in the western plain, and are divided from each other eastward by the in terposition of the Parirnd Mts. between the Orinoco and the Amazons, and the Brazilian Mts. between the Amazons and the La Plata. Thus the drainage of the eastern slope of the Andes for a length of about 33 degrees of latitude (from 8\u00b0 N. to 25\u00b0 S.), together with the bulk of the drainage of the two minor mountain-systems (Parim\u00a3 and Brazil), is compressed into 3 great arteries, which convey to the ocean floods of such volume as to make their streams perceptible some hundreds of miles away from land. It is difficult to realize tbe size of rivers whose tributaries frequently surpass the finest of the European trunk-streams. The Orinoco is 3J m. broad as it"], [601, "Chap. XXVI. HYDROGRAPHY. 585 traverses the Llanos : the Amazons is more than double that width : and the estuary of the La Plata is 170 m. broad. The Meta, a tributary of the Orinoco, is of about the same calibre as the Danube ; the Amazons itself at Eentema, before it well escapes from the Andes, is as large as the Rhine at Mayence, and the Yucayali at its conflucuce is a mile broad and over 50 fathoms deep. A striking peculiarity in these rivers is the slowness of their currents, consequent upon the extreme flatness of the plains : a strong wind will fre quently master the current and send it back towards its source. After disposing of these 3 basins, little remains to be said of the other rivers: the Magdalena in the N. is the drain of the New Granada valley of the Andes ; the Sao Francisco and the Paranahiba are the chief independent streams of the Brazilian Mts. The western slope of the Andes throws off a large number of short and rapid rivers to the Pacific. Lakes are of rare occurrence : the most re markable is the highland lake Titioaca, at an elevation of 12,850 ft. and having an area of 3210 sq. m. Lake Maraeaybo is a large and navigable sheet of water near the N. coast, having an outlet into the Gulf of Maraeaybo. The following table exhibits the leading facts respecting the rivers above mentioned ; but it must be borne in mind that the estimates are very variously given by different authorities. (1). The Orinoco rises on the western slope of the Parime range, about 3\u00b0 S. lat., and thence curves round like a strongly bent bow, reaching the sea after a course more than three times as long as the direct distance between its head and its mouth. In its upper course, which terminates at Esmeralda, it descends very rapidly : below Esme ralda it bifurcates, sending off* a branch, the Cassiquiare, to the Rio Negro and so to the Amazons. W. of 68\u00b0 it receives the Guaviare, a large stream, from the Andes, and then assumes a N. direction to the junction of the Apure in about 7\u00b0 36', making in this part of its course numerous cataracts, the chief of which are at Maypures and Atures in 5\u00b0 37', and receiving on its 1. bank numerous tributaries from the Andes, among which tbe Meta is pre-eminent. The Apure drains a large district lying in the angle between the New Granada Andes and the Venezuelan chains. From the confluence of the Apure the Ori noco turns E. through the Llanos, and here receives its chief feeders from the Parime' ranges. In 62\u00b0 W. long, it divides to form a huge 2 c 3 River.

Book IV. delta, the surface of which is very slightly elevated above the level of the water. The Apure and the Meta are navigable to the foot of the Andes. The inundations commence at the end of March and begin to decline at the end of August : they submerge vast areas on the Llanos so that about the junction of the Apure large vessels can sail over the plains for 5\" m. (2) The Amazons' or Maranon has its sources in the mountain-knot of Paseo,2 and traverses a highland valley in a N.W. direction to about 6\u00b0 S. lat., where it turns N.E., and bursts through the eastern Andes with a series of rapids hemmed in by precipices, which continue for 90 m. between the Pongos of Rentema and Manseriche. At this latter point it is 1164 ft. only above the level ofthe sea, and thence turning E. it traverses vast wooded plains witb an ever widening stream except at Obydos (55\u00b0 W. long.), where it is contracted to a width of 1738 yds., and enclosing numerous islands, especially at its mouth, where Marajo attains a size of above 10,000 sq. m. The tide runs up to Obydos, and the spring tide rushes in from the Atlantic with a 6ore (locally termed the prororoca) of amazing height and velocity which carries every thing before it. The Amazons begins to swell towards the end of December, and continues to rise for four months; but its southern tributaries do not flood at the same time as the northern ones, and consequently the rise is more irregular than in the Orinoco. The tributary streams in its mid-course rise in the Andes, and resemble in their general character the main stream, which they rival in width and volume. We may notice rt. the Huallaga, which runs in a parallel valley of the Andes; the Yucayali ; the Yavari ; the Puras, which rises in the direction of Lake Titieaca, and has been explored for nearly 2000 m. from its confluence ; and the Madeira, composed of the Beni and the Guapore with the Mamore : on the 1. bank tbe Putumayo ; the Japura ; aud the Eio Negro, which is much enlarged by feeders from the Parime Mountains, and particularly by the Cassiquiare from the Orinoco. The Brazilian Mountains contribute several large feeders to the lower course of the Amazons on the rt. bank, such as the Tapajos, the Xingu, aud the Tocantins, which joins one of the outlets ofthe Amazons (the Para), and may therefore be regarded as belonging to it : these rivers descend by cataracts from the highland to the plain, and are navigable only up to these points. (3) The Rio de La Plata is the name both of an estuary and of the river-system connected with it, which includes three main branches, the Parana, tbe Paraguay, and the Uruguay. The two former unite about 250 m. above the head of the estuary, and thenceforward retain the name of the Parana, which ranks as the principal stream, though the Paraguay is the most valuable both from the character of its stream and the direction of its course. The Paraguay rises on the S. slope of the Serra dos Vertentes iD 1 The name 'Amazons' originated in the report brought to Europe by Orellana that, in his adventurous voyage from I'eru down tbe river, he encountered resistance from a trib- of armed women. The name, however, is reported to be of Indian origin, meaning \" boat-destroyer,\" in reference to the prororoca. The name ' Marafion ' refers to the forest-growth on its banks, a feature also implied in the name of its tributary the Madeira, ' wood.' 2 The Tungaragua or Chavinello, which issues from Lake Lauricocha, is generally regarded as the source of the Amazons. The Janja, which rises on the opposite (S.) side of the Pasco mountain-knot, and joins the Apurimac under the name of Montaro, appeai-s, however, to be the long\u0153t branch of the Amazons."], [603, "Chap. XXVI. CLIMATE. 587 13\u00b0 S. lat., descends to a low plain, 500 ft. above the sea and extending 300 m. from N. to S. between 17\u00b0 and 22\u00b0 S. lat., where it forms vast marshes (the Lagunas de Xarayas) during the periodical floods, and thence flows through a well-wooded region to the confluence of the Parana, receiving in its course several important tributaries from the W., viz. the Jauru, which rises near the Guapore branch of tbe Madeira ; the Pilcomayo, which rises in the Bolivian Andes and tra verses the Gran Chaco ; and the Vermejo, which holds a parallel course to the Pilcomayo more S. The Parana is composed of two great branches, the Rio Grande or Parana, which rises on the W. slope of the Serra Mantigueira N.W. of Rio de Janeiro, and the Paranahiba, which rises in the angle formed by the Serras Espinhayo and dos Ver tentes : these meet in 19\u00b0 S. lat. 47\u00b0 W. long., and thence the stream flows S.W. to 27\u00b0 30' S. lat., where it turns W. to its confluence with the Paraguay. From this point it flows S.W. to the confluence of the Salado, au important tributary from the Despoblado Andes, navigable for barges to Matara in 28\u00b0 S. lat.; below this the Parana bends round to its estuary, the Rio de la Plata. The Uruguay, which joins the estuary from the N., rises on the Serra de Sta. Catharina in 27J\u00b0 S. lat. and bends round to the S.W., approximating to the Parana at its most southerly bend. The Paraguay is navigable up to the Jauru, in other words nearly to its source, without the slightest interruption ; the Parana, on the other hand, has a succession of rapids above the con fluence of the Curitiba in 25\u00b0 41'; and the Uruguay is similarly encum bered by falls above 31\u00b0 20'. The inundations commence in December, attain their maximum in April, and end in July. Below the confluence ofthe Parana the ordinary rise is 12 ft. \u00a7 4. Climate. \u2014 The bulk of South America lies within the Tropics, but the normal heat thus incidental to its position is modi- fied by the following salutary features in its configuration: \u2014 (1) Its exposure to the Atlantic Ocean and to the cooling breezes of the Trade Winds, which, surcharged with the moisture of the Ocean, sweep across the continent uninterruptedly to the Andes, and deposit their rain-clouds on the eastern slopes of that range. (2) The large amount of running water which traverses the breadth of the con- tinent. And (3) the abundant vegetation which clothes its surface, shading the soil from all direct action of the sun's rays over large areas, and providing beneath the dense forests reservoirs of compara- tively cool air. There is a sufficiency of rain in all parts except a portion of the western coast, between 4\u00b0 N. and 30\u00b0 S. lat., which, being shut off from the influence of the Atlantic by the Andes, is perfectly dry, and consequently barren. Even here the daily sea- breeze acts beneficially, particularly as it crosses a cold current of water which sweeps along the coast from the Antartic Ocean. The highlands of the Andes present every gradation of temperature : at 10,000 ft. above the sea (about the elevation of Quito) the climate is perfect, and even at 13,000 and 14,000 ft. (about the elevation of Potosi and Pasco) the temperature is very endurable. The extent of the elevated surface and the currents of heated air which ascend"], [604, "588 SOUTH AMERICA. Book IV. from the subjacent plains, exercise a marked influence on the tem perature, causing the snow-line to ascend in the Bolivian Andes about Lake Titicaca to above 17,000 ft., though under the Equator it stands at 15,748 ft. Even so far S. as Central Chili, about 33\u00b0 S. lat., the snow-line rises to 14,750 ft., perhaps in consequence of the dryness of the air. In the extreme S., Tierra del Fuego has a very stormy and cloudy atmosphere, which keeps it perpetually cold, though the cold does not appear to be excessive. On the whole, the climate of South America is highly favourable to vegetation, and better suited to the European constitution than any other tropical part of the world. \u00a7 5. Vegetation. \u2014 South America is pre-eminently the conti nent of vegetation : its tropical heat and plentiful irrigation combine to convert it into a natural forcing-house. Even the steppes, which in other parts of the world are barren wildernesses, are here either clothed with virgin forests or yield luxuriant herbage after rain. The flora is also as varied as it is luxuriant : in the Selvas of the Amazons the intermixture of the trees, and the contrasts of form, size, texture, and colour (for even the largest trees have their flowers), are truly remarkable. Parasitical creepers entwine about the larger plants and make a tangled web of foliage impenetrable even to the sun's rays. The luxuriance extends to the extreme S., the archipelago of Tierra del Fuego being well clothed with evergreens, particularly of the beech tribe. The regions most conspicuous for the absence of foliage are the western slope of the Andes, the subjacent plain on the side of the Pacific, and the Despoblado plateau. Among the plants of commercial value indi genous to South America, we may specify maize, the potato (sup posed to come originally from Chili), cacao, which grows wild in Peru, Bolivia, and Guiana, manioc or cassava, the cinchona, which yields the medicinal ' bark,' and which grows on the eastern slopes of the Andes, the siphonia elastica, whose juice forms caoutchouc or india-rubber, the mate or Paraguay tea-plant, and coca, whose leaves yield nutriment highly valued by the Indians. The other most valuable products, such as coffee, sugar-cane, indigo, cotton, and wheat, have been introduced from the Old World. South America has contributed to our shrubberies and gardens some of their greatest ornaments \u2014 such as the Araucaria imbricata from Chili and Patagonia, the Victoria regia from Guyana, and various orchidaceous plants. \u00a7 6. Animals. \u2014 The fauna of South America is characterized by multiplicity in the lower rather than by excellence in the higher forms. It is specially the continent of insects : the variety of the species, the numbers of the individuals, their ubiquity and their pertinacity, give them an unusual importance. Among them the"], [605, "Chap. XXVI. ANIMALS. 589 fire-flies are conspicuous for the brilliancy of their glow ; mosquitoes and gnats for their venomous voracity ; locusts for their wholesale devastations ; and white ants for their minor depredations. Reptiles are almost equally numerous and troublesome . frogs and toads attain enormous dimensions ; rattle-snakes and boa constrictors infest the forests, and caymans the rivers. In birds South America possesses peculiar species and even genera. The condor soars to the amazing height of 22,000 ft. among the Andes, and occasionally descends to the sea-level, its usual residence being between 10,000 and 15,000 ft. : the splendid king-vulture inhabits the forests of the plains: humming-birds and parrots pervade the whole continent: and we may further notice the burrowing owl of the Pampas, the quacharo or fat-bird found in the caverns of Caripe and Bogota, Hales in the Andes. the brilliant toucan, and the three-toed ostrich of the southern plains. The quadrupeds most worthy of notice are the four species of au chenia \u2014 a ruminating genus analogous to the camel of the Old World : these are found on the high Andes, where they feed on a coarse grass called ichu : two are domesticated, viz. the llama, which is largely used as a beast of burden, and the alpaca, which yields a long silky wool : the other two, the vicuna and the guanaco, are wild, and the former also yields a fine wool. The more valuable domes ticated animals\u2014 the ox, tbe horse, the ass, the mule (very valuable in the Andean district), and the sheep\u2014 are importations. In wild animals the puma and the jaguar are the strongest and fiercest ; the latter frequenting the forests, the former the hills and plains. They"], [606, "590 SOUTH AMERICA. Book IV. are inferior to the lion and tiger of the Old World. We may finally mention monkeys of peculiar kinds, some with prehensile, others with bushy tails ; opossums, sloths, armadilloes, ant-eaters, and various burrowing animals, such as the chlamyphorus, the chin chilla, whose fur is much esteemed, and the biscacha of the Pampas. \u00a7 7. Minerals. \u2014 As a mineral region South America does not hold so high a position in the world as she once did. The circum stances that have conduced to this are (1) the discovery of the precious metals in more accessible and inviting spots ; and (2) the political disquietudes of the republics ; to which we may add (3) the exhaustion of some of the most famous mines. The mines in the Andes are frequently found at extraordinary elevations and surrounded by a sterile country : the town of Potosi is 13,330 ft. above the sea, and Pasco even higher, 13,720 ft. ; and the Cliota or Gualgayoc mine in the valley of the Maranon 13,260 ft. The most productive mines of Chili, though near the sea-level, are in an utterly barren and forbidding wilderness. The great Potosi silver mine now yields metal of a very low quality. Still, the mineral resources of South America are unbounded : the eastern ridges of the Andes contain large deposits of gold, much of which is washed down by the rivers ; the western range also contains gold in New Granada, and the southern part of the Serra Espinhaco in Brazil is rich in the same metal. Chili is particularly abundant in silver, the chief mines being situated about Copiapo in the desert of Atacama. On the high Andes the mines of Pasco and Chota are now the most productive. In the western provinces of the Ar gentine Republic the Sierra Famatina is argentiferous. In New Granada there are silver mines at Mariquita. Indeed it would be difficult to enumerate all the spots where silver is found. Quick silver is obtained at Huanca-Velica in Peru; platinum in New Granada ; and copper in Chili and other parts. Coal has been dis covered in various localities ; but Chili is the only country in which it is produced to any appreciable amount. Brazil is rich in diamonds, and the finest emeralds come from Muso in New Granada. Rock-salt is found in New Granada, and in various parts of the Andes. \u00a7 8. Inhabitants. \u2014 The Indians hold their ground more suc cessfully in South than in North America. So large a portion of the continent is unoccupied and even unvisited by Europeans, that there is room for all. When the country was first discovered by the Spaniards two branches had attained to a considerable degree of culture, viz. : the Peruvians, under the Incas dynasty, with Cuzco for their capital, and the Muiscas or Chibchas, who occupied the plateau of Bogota in New Granada. Lake Titicaca was the earliest seat of Peruvian civilization, which dates back to the llth century,"], [607, "Chap. XXVI. INHABITANTS. \" 591 and has left memorials of its presence in the cyclopean monuments at Tiaganuco, Cuzco,' and other spots. The descendants of these ancient Peruvians still form the bulk of the population of Peru, and exhibit a moderate capacity for modern civilization: they are Christianized, with the exception of those who live on the eastern plains. The condition of the Indian tribes elsewhere is very various : where they have been in long contact with Europeans they have' become semi-civilized, but elsewhere they live in every stage of barbarism, and in tbe south carry on to the present day a predatory warfare against the whites. The immigrant population consists Indians of the Pajnpas. mainly of Spaniards, Portuguese, and Negroes. The latter are more numerous in Brazil than elsewhere ; in the Spanish republics they constitute only about one per cent, of the population. The Portuguese are the dominant race in Brazil, where they form about l-9th part of the population. The Spaniards hold the west coast, the northern states of New Granada and Venezuela, Bolivia, and the Argentine Republic : they form on the average about l-5th portion of the population in these countries. The other European nations repre sented in South America are tbe British, the French, and the Dutch, who divide Guyana between them, but are numerically un-"], [608, "592 SOUTH AMERICA. Book IV. important. The mixed races exceed the whites in number through out the continent in the proportion of 3 to 2. \u00a7 9. Political Divisions \u2014 Historical Geography \u2014 Political Condition \u2014 Religion. \u2014 South America is divided between the fol lowing states : \u2014 The Empire of Brazil, which monopolizes nearly the half of the continent ; the Republics or Confederations of Colombia or New Granada, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chili, the Argentine Republic, Paraguay, and Uruguay ; and the colonial possessions of Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands in Guyana. Patagonia is excluded from the above list as being practically an independent Indian territory. Historical Geography. \u2014 The history of the South American states is of so uniform a character that it seems unnecessary to give separate sketches under the head of each country. It was in the early part of the 16th century that Spain took possession of various parts of South America \u2014 Venezuela in 1529, Peru in 1531, Paraguay in 1536, New Granada in 1537, and Chili in 1541. Portugal had nominally taken possession of Brazil in 1500, and grants of land were made to indi viduals about 1 530, but the Government did not organize an adminis tration until 1549, Buenos Ayres was originally founded by the Spaniards in 1535, but they were obliged to withdraw and did not permanently settle there until 1580. Spain governed her South American colonies in the first instance through a single viceroy, whose seat was at Lima in Peru : in 1718 a second viceroyalty was created for the northern provinces, with Bogota for its capital ; this was subse quently subdivided, and Caracas became the seat of a third viceroyalty; yet a fourth was added in 1778 by separating the Argentine states \u2014 Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay \u2014 from Peru and placing them under the viceroy of Buenos Ayres. Chili formed a separate government under a captain-general. The downfall of the Spanish dynasty in 18o8 gave the first impulse to the revolutionary movement in South America. New Granada established her independence in 1811; the Argentine States in 1816, Chili in 1818, Venezuela in 1819, Peru in 1821, Brazil in 1822, and Bolivia (heretofore Upper Peru) in 1825. The most im portant changes that have occurred in the political arrangements of the states have been : \u2014 The adoption of an exclusive policy by Paraguay in 1817 and its separation from all the adjacent states; the combination of New Granada and Venezuela in the republic of Colombia in 1819, the adhesion of Quito to the same confederation in 1823, the secession of Venezuela in 1829, the re-formation of the confederation, and its final dissolution in 1831 ; the independence of Uruguay by treaty between Brazil and Buenos Ayres in 1828; and the union of Buenos Ayres with the other Argentine States in 1861. Political condition. \u2014 The political condition of the South American states since their independence has been, generally speaking most unhappy. The Spanish states are nominally republics, framed more or less on the model of the United States. But a chronic disaffection prevails, and the forms of republicanism are made to subserve the ambitious views of rival presidents, who become in reality military dictators. Chili is an exception to this rule : no revolutions have occurred there, and the original constitution has been sustained with peace and order. Paraguay has been governed most arbitrarily by an"], [609, "Chap. XXVI. COLOMBIA. 593 hereditary dictator. Buenos Ayres has suffered terribly from presi dential contests. Bolivia and New Granada are constantly in a state of anarchy. The Portuguese state of Brazil has thus far had a stable monarchical government under a branch of the royal family of the mother country. Religion. \u2014 Roman Catholicism prevails everywhere in South America, except among the English, and some of the German, Dutch, and Swiss settlers. It is largely accepted by the Indians who live in contact with the Spaniards and Portuguese, and would have been yet more extended, but for the suppression of the Jesuit missions in 1767. As to the beneficial results of these missions in civilizing the Indians, there can be no question. The priests gathered the natives about them in settled communities and instructed them in agriculture and other arts. At the time of their expulsion, large tracts, now almost deserted, were occupied by the Christianized Indians : in the region, for instance, still called Missiones, E. of the Parana, there were 100,000 inhabitauts, where now there are not above 10OO : and the ruins of their establish ments are yet to be seen on the upper waters of the Amazons basin. \u00a7 10. Colombia or New Granada. \u2014 The United States of Colombia (as New Granada is now officially styled) extend from the 63rd meridian on the Isthmus of Panama to the Gulf of Maracaybo on the Caribbean Sea, and to the mouth of the Mira (1\u00b0 36' N. lat.) on the coast of the Pacific. Its inland limits in the S.E. are uncer tain : it claims as its S. boundary the Maranon between the Napo and the Japura, and as its E. boundary the Cassiquiare and the Orinoco ; and in this case its area equals 514,325 sq. m. : but, sub tracting the portions claimed on the one side by Venezuela and on the other by Ecuador, its area will be reduced to 368,323 sq. m. Its population is estimated at 2,794,473. Coast Line. \u2014 New Granada is the only State in South America which possesses a sea-board on the two oceans. In this respect its position is highly favourable. The coast-line is much indented ; on the Caribbean Sea we may notice the Chiriqui Lagoon, a spacious and deep basin, sheltered by islands at its entrance ; Navy Bay, on which stands Aspin- wall, convenient, but exposed to violent storms ; the Gulf of Darien, and the Bay of MorrosquiUo ; on the Pacific, the Gulf of Panama, with its subordinate Bays of Panama, Parita, and Santa Miguel, and the Pearl Islands ; and, further S., the Bay of Choco. The chief port of Granada is Cartagena, in 75\u00b0 35' W. long., a noble harbour, ap- proached by a narrow and easily defended passage, and expanding into a spacious, sheltered, and deep basin. Santa Marta is the best harbour to the E. of the Magdalena. On the Isthmus of Panama there are good harbours at Porto Bello (unhealthy) and Limones or Navy Bay, on which is Aspinwall, the terminus of the Panama railway ; on the opposite coast there is a roadstead at Panama, protected by the islands of Perico and Flamenco, about 2J m. from the pier, and in another part by Taboga, 9 m. distant, which has been- selected as the British anchorage : elsewhere there are river-ports accessible at high water in the estuaries of the Paeora and the Rio Grande. More S., Buenaven tura, in the Bay of Choco, is the most frequented harbour. Mountains and Rivers.\u2014 New Granada is traversed by the divergent"], [610, "594 COLOMBIA. Book IV. arms of the Andes as already described in \u00a7 2 ; in addition to these it possesses the semi-isolated and lofty range entitled the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, which, though connected with the eastern Cordillera of the Andes by the Sierra Ocana, attains an individuality through its great elevation (rising in La Horqueta to nearly 20,000 ft.), its rugged outline, and its deeply furrowed sides. It skirts the coast from the mouth of the Magdalena to the extremity of the peninsula of Goajira. A large portion of the country is occupied by highlands, some of wbich are beyond the reach of cultivation, while others, and par ticularly the table-lands of Bogota and Tunja, are of a sufficient eleva tion to be fertile and habitable. Extensive plains stretch away from the eastern Cordillera to the Orinoco, in the northern part bare and yielding only pasture, in the southern covered with dense forests and very unhealthy. The maritime plains are low and also unhealthy. New Granada possesses in its eastern division the head-waters of various feeders of the Orinoco (the Meta, the Vichada, the Guaviare) and of the Maranon (the Negro, the Japura, and the Putumayo) ; but the river more especially belonging to New Granada is the Magdalena, which drains the valley between the Central and Eastern Cordilleras, and receives the Cauca which runs parallel to it between the Central and the Coast Cordilleras. These two rivers traverse narrow but generally level valleys in their upper courses, and descend rapidly from this upper terrace to the lower plain with a series of rapids, which occur on the Magdalena below Honda, aud in the Cauca below Cartago, where the river traverses a remarkable glen. The lower plain is unhealthy and little inhabited. Of the climate it is unnecessary to say much: the great variations of altitude produce every variety of temperature and consequently of vegetation \u2014 tropical plants in the lowlands (maize, plaintains, rice, cacao, and sugar), and European cereals on the uplands. The forests yield logwood, fustic, cinchona, Tolu balsam, &c; and the Llanos sustain vast herds of cattle and horses. The mineral resources are valuable, and comprise gold dust found in the rivers, gold and silver at Mariquita, mercury (at Santa Rosa and Quindiu), platinum, iron, coal, and rock-salt. Inhabitants \u2014 Political Divisions \u2014 Government \u2014 Towns. \u2014 The popula- tion of New Granada consists, one-half of Europeans and Creoles, the other half of meztizoes (600,000), negroes (90,000), zamboes and other mixed races (466,000), and independent Indians (126,000), who are most numerous in Magdalena, Cauca, and Boyaca. The chief occupa- tions are agriculture and a little mining : commerce is restricted by the unsettled state of the country and the want of roads, and, indied, can hardly be said to exist elsewhere than on the Isthmus of Panama, where an immense transit business is carried on by the railway in goods and passengers between the United States and California. Co- lombia is a Federal Republic, consisting of 9 States, independent as regards their own affairs, and having a central government for common interests, in which the executive power is exercised by a President and 4 Ministers, and the legislative by two chambers \u2014 a Senate of 3 members from each State, and a house of Deputies elected at the rate of one for each 50, 000 inhabitants. Panama has a President and Con- stituent Assembly of its owu for the management of its State affairs. The present order of things in New Granada dates from 1 863, and is one of many schemes tried in this ill-governed part of the world. The positions of the States are in some instances implied in their names : this is the case with Ystmo (Isthmus), Magdalena, and Cauca. Of"], [611, "595 Chap. XXVI. VENEZUELA. the rest, Bolivar (so named after the patriot) lies on the coast about Cartagena, Boyaea (another political designation drawn from the scene of Bolivar's great victory in 1819) is about the Meta, Cundinamarca (an old Indian designation) surrounds the capital Bogota and stretches across the eastern Andes to the plains ; Antioquia is on the mid-Cauca, about the town of the same name ; Santander lies E. of the middle Magdalena; and the new state of Tolima, on the E. slope of the central Cordillera, is made up of the old provinces of Mariquita and Neyva. The towns call for but brief notice : Bogota or, more fully, Santa Fe de Bogota (+5,000), stands on a high terrace of the eastern Andes already noticed in \u00a7 2, and on the banks of a stream of the same name which iuake3 a remarkably picturesque fall at Tequendama about 18 m. below the town. Cartagena ( 1 0, OOu ) , the chief port and arsenal of the Confederation, is unhealthy and unthriving : it was unsuccessfully at tacked by the British in 1741. Santa Marta (8000), the other chief port, is also in a decaying state. There are some more flourishing towns on the Cauca, \u2014 Popayan (20,000) in the upper valley, a place which suffered severely from earthquake in 1834 ; Medellin (14,000), a commercial entrepot ; and Antioquia (20,000) with gold-mines near it. Mompox (10,000) holds an important position on the Magdalena above the confluence of the Cauca. Panama (12,000) is well situated on a rocky peninsula stretching out into the sea ; it is the station for the Californian and Australasian lines of steamers, and one of the ter mini of the railway that crosses the isthmus. Aspinwall or Colon, the other terminus, is a new town on an island in Navy Bay on the Caribbean Sea. Porto Bello was formerly an important place, and was taken by Admiral Vernon in 1739. \u00a7 11. Venezuela. \u2014 Venezuela extends along the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic from the Gulf of Maracaybo in the W. to the Great (most southerly) mouth of the Orinoco in the E. Its interior boundaries on the side of New Granada and British Guiana are somewhat uncertain: omitting the doubtful territories in these directions, its area is 368,220 sq. m., but, including these, it will amount to 430,000 sq. m. The population now probably amounts to 2,200,000. Coast-line and harbours. \u2014 Venezuela possesses a coast-line of nearly 1600 m\u201e of which about 150 m. lie on the Atlantic, the remainder on the Caribbean Sea. The chief inlets from W. to E. are the Gulf of Maracaybo or Venezuela, which has an opening about 50 m. wide between Pt. Espada and the peninsula of Paraguana, and thence extends 100 m. S.W. to the channel leading to the Lake of Maracaybo; Triste Gulf, on the S. coast of which is Puerto Cabello, the best harbour in the country, protected by an island, and spacious ; Cariaco Bay, 40 m. long, and supplying good harbourage ; and the Gulf of Paria, inclosed N. by the mouutain-ridge which forms the peninsula of Paria, and E. by the isle of Trinidad, with channels leading in on each side of that island, the Dragon's Mouth from the Caribbean Sea, the Serpent's Mouth from the Atlantic. La Guayra, which serves as the port of Caracas, has only a roadstead. \u201e, _.\u201e -,, . , Mountains, plains, and rivers\u2014 The Eastern Cordillera of the Andes enters Venezuela to the S. of Lake Maracaybo with a m^sive range topped for the most part with table-lands about 11,000 ft. high, and"], [612, "Book IV. 596 VENEZUELA. reaching the snow-line in the two peaks of Merida, which rise to 15,310 and 15,342 ft. The Andes are considered to terminate about the 69th meridian in the plateau of Barquisimeto, where they meet with the coast-ranges which form the special feature in the conformation of Venezuela : these diverge W. over the province of Coro to the peninsula of Paraguana, and E. along the coast to the peninsula of Paria, this latter section being divided into two parts by a break between the rivers Gueve and Neveri. The region most deserving of attention is that which lies between 68\u00b0 45' and 66\u00b0 W. long. : here are two parallel ranges, one of which skirts the shore closely, and rises in the Silla da Caracas to 8808 ft. and in the Pio de Naiguata to 9480 ft., while the other or more southerly one extends further E. to the Gueve. These ranges are connected by a transverse chain or mountain-knot, which thus subdivides the depression between them into two parts, the western called the valley of Aragua and containing Lake Valencia, the eastern the valley of the Tuy. S. of the coast-ranges to the Orinoco are exten sive plains, occupying 3-4ths of the whole area of the country, and varying iu character \u2014 bare to the N. of the Meta, and wooded to the S. of it \u2014 swampy and jungly in the alluvial delta of the Orinoco, dry and sandy on the table-lands (Mesas) \u2014 yielding luxuriant herbage after rain, but at other times dry and parched \u2014 most fertile at the base of the Andes, where the rivers pour down across the province of Barinas, inundating the lower lands and thus producing fine pastures during the dry season, but leaving the knolls and banks adapted for cultivation. S. of the Orinoco a narrow strip of varying width intervenes between the river and the outlying ridges of the Parime Mts. This system covers the S.E. portion of Venezuela, and consists of bare uplands of moderate elevation with wooded ranges interspersed, little inhabited and still less known, the only part that may be excepted from this description being the picturesque and fertile region about Upata, W. of the Imataca Mts. and justS. ofthe Orinoco. The rivers of Venezuela are very numerous : the majority of them belong to the Orinoco basin, and have been already mentioned in connexion with that river in \u00a7 3. In addition to these, a section of the Rio Negro falls withui the limits of Venezuela, together with tbe upper course of the Cuyuwini, a branch of the Essequibo. Lake Maracaybo, near the N. coast, is about 100 m. long, and has au area of 7800 sq. m. : it is navigable, but has its entrance encumbered by a bar. In the channel connecting it with the gulf of Venezuela the first European explorers found the inhabitants occupying pile-dwellings, and, being thus reminded of Venice, they called the country Venezuela or\" Little Venice.\" Climate and productions. \u2014 The plains of Venezuela have a tropical climate, with a dry season between September and March, and a wet one in the other months, with the exception of an interval of a month about midsummer, which is called the \" Little Summer of St. John.\" The higher grounds have of course lower temperatures of varying de grees ; but the proportion of the tierras templadas and frias is small as compared with the tierras calidas. Caracas, at an elevation of 2880 ft., has an equable temperature of about 7o\u00b0. The forests of Venezuela yield numerous cabinet- woods and dye-woods; the caoutchouc is com mon, and on the Andes the cinchona. The cocoa-palm, plaintain, and yucca are among the cultivated trees ; maize, coffee, cotton, sugar, indigo, and tobacco form the staple crops. The plains sustain cattle, horses, and sheep in large numbers. Caymans are very common in the rivers ; electrical eels in the marshes ; monkeys, snakes, and parrots in the forests. Minerals are unimportant."], [613, "Chap. XXVI. ECUADOR. 597 Inhabitants\u2014 Government\u2014 Political Divisions\u2014 Towns\u2014 The popula tion of Venezuela consists of the same elements as we have already mentioned in connexion witb New Granada, but not in the same pro portions, the whites constituting less than a quarter, and the mixed races and Indians being in greater force. Agriculture forms almost the sole occupation : manufactures and commerce are in a languishing state. The Government, since 1863, is nominally a Federal Republic, consisting of 7 States iu lieu of the 13 old Provinces : but in 1864 5 out of the 7 States seceded from the confederation. The country suffers from political commotions and national bankruptcy. The most extensive of the territorial divisions is Guyana, which includes all that lies S. of the Orinoco : the district between the Andes and the Apure is named Barinas. Caracas (50,000), the capital of the Republic, stands on high ground, 16 m. from the north coast, having La Guayra as its port : it suffered terribly from an earthquake in 1812. Maracaybo (20,000', on the lake of the same name, appears to be an active and prosperous commercial town. Valencia ' 16,000j stands near the lake of the same name, and is an entrepot for the commerce that reaches Puerto Cabello from the interior. We may further notice : \u2014 Barcelona (7000), a port on the estuary of the Neveri, once of much greater importance ; Cumana (8000), at the entrance of the Gulf of Cariaco, the oldest Spanish settlement on this coast ; and Angostura or Ciudad Bolivar (8000), on the Orinoco, 240 m. from its mouth, the chief outlet for the produce of the Llanos. Off the north coast lies the important island of Marga rita, whose name testifies to the former abundance of the pearl-oyster about it. \u00a7 12. Ecuador. \u2014 The position of Ecuador is to a certain extent indicated by its name : it lies on each side of the Equator, stretching along the seaboard of the Pacific from the mouth of the Mira in 1\u00b0 36' N. lat. to the southern limit of the Gulf of Guayaquil in 3\u00b0 30' S. lat. Its boundary on the side of New Granada follows in part the St. Miguel and Putumayo rivers, and on the side of Peru the Santiago and Amazons, though by some authorities it is carried S. of the Amazons to include the district of Maynas : it meets Brazil at the 70th meridian. Its area is estimated at 219,000 sq. m., and its population at 1,300,000. Natural features\u2014 Climate and productions. \u2014 The coast from the N. boundary down to Point St. Elena in 2\u00b0 15' S. lat. consists of a succes sion of open bays with high rocky shores and moderate harbours at Ataeames and EBmeraldas. S. of Pt. St. Elena is the Gulf of Guayaquil, up which the shipping passes to the river-port of Guayaquil. The in terior consists of two very distinct districts, the broad belt of the Andes near the coast, and the wide-spreading plains to the E. of the Andes traversed by numerous tributaries of the Amazons. The latter region calls for no description, as it partakes of the general character of the central plains, and is very thinly populated. The Andes of this state have been already described in \u00a7 2 : they form the most valuable and most densely populated portion of the country, affording every gradation of temperature from the perpetual spring of Quito to the arctic snows of the highest peaks and the tropical heat ofthe lower slopes. The rivers which descend to the Pacific are unimportant, with the"], [614, "Book IV. 598 ECUADOR. exception of the Guayaquil, which is navigable for 40 m. by vessels of burthen, and is followed in its mid-course by the road to the highlands. The productions of the country are of a tropical character in the low valleys, some of which (particularly that of Guayaquil) are very fertile in cacao, tobacco, sugar-cane, yams, bananas, rice, &c The highland basins, on the other hand, are adapted to European cereals, and produce wheat of good quality. The cinchona is the most valuable product of the forests. The highest table-land3 afford extensive pastures, cn which are fed cattle and sheep. The mineral produce is small, though the capacities of the country in this respect are considerable. The fisheries, particularly of turtle, are valuable. Inhabitants \u2014 Government \u2014 Political Divisions \u2014 Towns. \u2014 The popula tion is composed one-half of whites, the other half mainly of Indians, the exceptions behig about 8000 negroes and 36,600 meztizoes. Agri culture forms the leading occupation, the manufactures being confined to rough textures and some lace. The chief article of export is cacao, which is of the first quality. The country is a Republic, governed by a President, Vice-president, 2 Ministers, Senate, and House of Repre sentatives. It is now divided into 10 provinces, but the old threefold division is still current, consisting of the departments of Guayaquil, Quito, and Assuay, the last lying E. of the Andes. The capital of the Republic is Quito (76,000), which lies in a lofty basin almost under the Equator, at the base of the volcano Pichincha, and surrounded by a noble series of snowy summits : it has suffered severely from earth quakes, particularly in 1797, when it was threatened with utter de struction by an eruption of Pichincha, and in 1859 : it is poorly built, but has a noble Franciscan monastery and a fine church : it is the seat of a University and other institutions, and is the centre of the com mercial transactions of the highlands. Guayaquil (22,000) is the chief port of the Republic ; it lies low and is a malarious, pestilential place, dependent for its existence on its excellent harbour. Cuenca (20,o00j, the capital of Assuay, is a populous but uninteresting place, situated'in the most southerly of the 3 mountain-basins of Ecuador. Numerous memorials of the Incas period are to be found in the highlands \u2014 palaces at Tacunga and Riobamba, and portions of the great road be tween Quito and Cuzco. The Galapagos group of islands belongs to Ecuador: it lies under the Equator about 750 m. from the mainland, and consists of 1 0 larger and several smaller isles, with an aggregate area of 2930 sq. m. : they are of volcanic origin, with no less than 2000 craters, and are interesting to the naturalist from their peculiar fauna which entitles them to be regarded as a distinct region ; they abound with huge tortoises (whence the name), and are visited by whaling vessels, but have no settled inhabitants."], [615, "599 Incaj Rains at Sillustani on the shores of Lake Umayu.

Peru.\u2014 Peru extends along the Pacific from 3\u00b0 30' S. lat. where it adjoins Ecuador, to 21\u00b0 25' (the mouth of the Eio de Loa) where it adjoins Bolivia, a stretch of about 1150 m. in direct distance. Inland it penetrates along the Amazons to the confluence of the Javari, then recedes by the course of the latter river, protrudes again along the Purus to 67\u00b0 45' W. long., and thence gradually tapers down to a breadth of about 100 m. from the 1 7th parallel southwards. Its area is estimated at 510,091 sq. m., and its popula- tion at 2,500,000. Coast-line.\u2014 Peru possesses a coast-line of about 1500 m., generally regular and cliffy. In the extreme N. it protrudes considerably and is varied by the large and open Bays of Payta and Sechura, the former of which offers good harbourage. From this protrusion to C. Carretas in 14\u00b0 10' the hi\u00bbh ground recedes from the coast and leaves a strip of sandy plain. Some of the small bays offer good harbourage,"], [616, "Book IV. 600 PERU. particularly the four between the 9th and 10th parallels named Santa, Eerrol, Samanco, and Casma: elsewhere the harbours are formed by sheltering islands, as is the case with Callao, which is fronted by the isles of San Lorenzo and Fronton and has a safe and roomy harbour between them and the mainland; Pisco, which is protected by the Ballista and Chinchas islands; Port Islay in 16\u00b0 55', which serves as the Port of Arequipa; Arica in 18\u00b0 28'; and Iquique in 20\u00b0 10'. The northern ports of Lambayeque and Truxillo have only roadsteads. A heavy surf breaks along the whole of this coast, rendering the dis charge of cargoes a difficult operation in any but the most sheltered spots. Natural features. \u2014 The Andes (see preceding chap. \u00a7 2) traverse Peru with great regularity on the side of the Pacific and descend to the sea with a uniform slope, furrowed at varying intervals with valleys watered by mountain-torrents, which are generally absorbed before reaching the sea. Between these valleys are sandy uplands. This whole region is designated Los Valles. The mountain region (Montana) contains several well defined divisions \u2014 the table-lands of Pasco and Cuzco, the high valleys of the Amazons and Huallaga on the northern slope of tbe Pasco table-land, and of the Janja or Montaro on its southern slope ; the high valleys of the Apurimac and Urubamba on the northern slope of the Cuzco table-land, and of the upper Desa guedero on its southern slope. Little is known of the country lying E. of the Andes : it appears to consist of wooded plains with intervening ridges. The rivers of this section of Peru belong to the Amazons system. Climate and productions. \u2014 The heat of the Valley region is tempered by the daily sea-breezes, which set in with great regularity: rain hardly ever falls, but its absence is partly compensated by a peculiar fog, locally termed the garua, which supplies sufficient moisture to the soil. The temperature at Lima ranges between 80\u00b0 and 84\u00b0 in summer, and 20 degrees lower during the season of the garua between June and November. The valleys produce maize, sugar-cane, potatoes, yams, bananas, olives, and grapes. Tbe soil is sandy, but fertile under careful culture and irrigation. The forests on the eastern slopes of the Andes yield cabinet-woods, dye-woods, cinchona, caoutchouc, vanilla, sarsaparilla, &c. The temperature of the high land region generally adapts it to European cereals and fruits: but on tbe most elevated table-lands quinoa is the only grain that will ripen. Rain is abundant in this region. The mineral resources of Peru are still very considerable though the produce is comparatively small. The silver mines of Cerro de Pasco and the quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are amongst the most valuable. The llama is largely used for the transport of goods on the Andes; and the alpaca sheep ia reared for its wool. The turtle is of commercial value for the oil extracted from its eggs. Guano has of late years been the mainstay of Peruvian prosperity : the largest deposits are on the Chincha islands in 13\u00b030'S. lat. Inhabitants \u2014 Political Divisions \u2014 Towns. \u2014 The Indians form a pre ponderating element in the population of Peru, to the extent of 4-5ths of the whole. In the western districts \u2014 Los Valles and Montana \u2014 they are Christianized and have attained a moderate degree of European culture: they still retain their own language, the Quichua, which is also acquired by many of the whites. The eastern plains are occupied by independent and generally heathen tribes, numbering about 400,000 souls. Agriculture forms the principal, and mining the subordinate"], [617, "Chap. XXVII. BOLIVIA. 601 employment of the Peruvians. Manufactures are confined to the coarse textures worn by the Indians, articles of domestic use in iron and leather, gold and silver trinkets, &c. Wine is made at Pisco and other places in its neighbourhood. The export commerce of Peru is chiefly carried on from Callao and consists of precious metals, copper, medicinal bark, wool, and hides. Peru is a Republic, divided into 13 departments aud the 3 littoral (shore) provinces of Loreto, Callao, and lea, with a President who holds office for 5 years, a Senate of 36 members, and a Chamber of Deputies, elected at the rate of 1 for each 20,000 inhabitants. The political and financial state of the country is discouraging to its prospects. The capital of the country is Lima (70,000) situated on a plain 453 ft. above the sea, and intersected by the river Rimac, 6 m. distant from its port of Callao (20,000) with which it is connected by a railway: it was founded by Pizarro in 1535, and is well laid out with regular streets and large open places, the Plaza Mayor or grand square being one of the finest in America: the houses are generally of a single story on account of the prevalence of earthquakes : the public buildings consist of the Court-house, formerly the Viceregal residence, a fine Cathedral with gorgeous decorations, the vast but now almost deserted monastery of San Francisco, and other religious edifices. Lima is the seat of the oldest university in America. Arequipa (30,000), the second city in Peru, stands 170 m. S.E. of Lima, on the high road leading to the S. and across the Cor dilleras to Bolivia : it is a place of large trade, both by sea and land, having its port at Islay: it is also a substantially built and well watered town ; aud has a modern cathedral of the Corinthian order. Cuzco (45,000) ranks as the third city in Peru : it stands in the liigh basin named after it at an elevation of 11,400 ft., and as the old capital of the Incas is the centre of the historical associations of the old Empire : here stood the magnificent Temple of the Sun, its walls now serving for the Dominican monastery, and the fortress, the cyclopean remains of which are still existing : and from here radiated the 4 high roads leading to the 4 quarters of the empire, and constructed with extra ordinary care. Cuzco is now the seat of a university and of various public institutions. We may further notice: \u2014 Caxamarca in the N., where are the ruins of the palace of Atahualpa, the Inca whom Pizarro murdered; Truxillo, so named by Pizarro after his native town in Spain; Ayacucho, a village where the Spaniards were defeated, Dec. 9, 1824, by the Peruvians and Colombians: the name has been assigned to the department in which it stands as well as to its capital, previously known as Huamanga (16,000), a considerable town between Lima and Cuzco; Pasco, the highest town in the world, 13,720 ft. above the sea, surrounded by silver mines ; and Puno (9000), on the W. shore of Lake Titicaca. \u00a7 2. Bolivia. \u2014 The boundaries of Bolivia appear to be more than usually uncertain : it claims a seaboard of 250 m. on the Pacific, between the rivers Loa on tbe side of Pern and Paposo in 25J\u00b0 on the side of Chili, but in the latter direction the claim is contested as to all lying S. of Mexillones Bay. In the interior its S. boundary is usually placed at the 22nd parallel, between the rivers Vermejo and Paraguay : Bolivia, however, claims in this quarter the region between these rivers S. of 22\u00b0 to their confluence, forming the bulk MOD. GEO. \" D"], [618, "602 BOLIVIA. Book IV. of the Gran Chaco. In the N.E. Bolivia extends to the point where the Guapore' branch of the Madeira is intersected by the 10th parallel : but it also claims a more northerly district up to 6\u00b0 23' S. lat. Its area is hence very variously given, the highest estimate placing it at 843,000 sq. m. and the lowest at 374,480 sq. m. : the latter is nearest to the mark, but is probably too low. Its population is estimated at 1,987,352. Natural features. \u2014 The coast is sandy and barren, and Bolivia pos sesses a single port, and that an indifferent one, at Cobija: Algodon Bay, the only other place that offers anchorage, lies N. of Cobija. The greater part of the interior is a highland region, the limits of which have been already defined in \u00a7 2 of the previous chapter: beyond this are the Selvas of tbe Amazons basin. The high basin of the Desaguedero with the lower part of Lake Titicaca belongs to Bolivia; and the eastern Cordilleras are divided between the basins of the Amazons and the Paraguay, the former receiving from this quarter the Purus and the Madeira, and the latter the Pilcomayo. The Madeira is more especially the river of Bolivia : it is composed of two great branches, the Beni and the Mamore, which unite in 10\u00b0 40' S. lat. : the Beni again is composed of three branches \u2014 the Caca, tbe Chuqueapo and the Quetoto ; and the Mamor6 of the Rio Grande, the Chapare, and the Guapore or Itenez, which reaches it from Brazil. The climate re sembles that of Peru \u2014 the coast-region dry and liable to earthquakes; the highlands with varying temperature, a rainy season during the summer months, i.e., from November to May, and perfectly dry weather during the winter ; and the eastern plain humid and pesti lential. The valleys on the eastern side of the Andes are among the most favoured parts of America in respect both to soil and climate, particularly tbe upper valleys of the Rio Grande and Pilcomayo. These from their varying altitude produce European as well as tropical productions. Vanilla, copaiba, balsam, sarsaparilla, caoutchouc, and coca are among the special products of this region. Gold dust is found in the rivers of the eastern Cordillera and copper is everywhere abundant : the silver mines, on the other hand, for which the Andes of Bolivia were once so famed (Potosi having produced 280,000,000,0001. sterling), now yield a very poor ore. Inhabitants \u2014 Political Divisions \u2014 Towns. \u2014 The population of Bolivia consists about 3-4ths of Indians, and the remaining fourth of whites and mixed races. The Indians of the highlands speak the Quichua or Incas language, and are Christianized : those of the plains are for the most part in the lowest stage of civilization, particularly the Chiquitos and Moxos. The number of the wild or independent Indians is estimated at 245,000. The Spanish Creoles are most numerous in the mining districts and the valleys of the eastern Cordilleras. Agriculture forms the chief, almost the only, resource fo the country : it is supplemented by mining and manufactures of wool and cotton for home use. Commerce is at a low ebb, inasmuch as the port of Cobija on the Pacific can be reached only across passes about 15,000 ft. high, and the eastern rivers are unprovided with regular means of communication. Foreign goods are chiefly imported through Peru. Bolivia is a Republic with a President and a legislative body of 3 chambers \u2014 Tribunes, Senators and Censors. It is frequently convulsed with intestine struggles. The political divisions are 9,"], [619, "Chap. XXVII. CHILI. 603 of which 7 are styled departments and 2 provinces. The capital is Chuquisaca or Sucre (23,979), founded in 1528, and standing on an elevated plateau which forms the watershed between the basins of the Madeira and the Paraguay : it has a university and 27 churches, among them a very fine cathedral, and appears to be, on the whole, an inviting place. La Paz (42,580) is the chief town in the highlands : it stands on the Chuqueapo, an affluent of the Eeni, S.E. of Titicaca, but on a lower level than the lake by about 1000 ft. : it is a commercial entrepot between Bolivia and Peru. The other chief towns are Cochabamba (40,678) on the Rio Grande; Potosi (22,850) in the chief mining district, much reduced in wealth and population ; Santa Cruz de la Sierra (9780), the capital of the eastern plains ; and Tarija (5680), near the frontier of the Argentine Republic. \u00a7 3. Chili. \u2014 Chili or Chile (for the final vowel is variously given) extends along the coast of the Pacific from the frontier of Bolivia in the N. to the Strait of Magellan in the S. Its limits are, as usual, contested in every direction ; in the N. it claims the section of coast belonging to Bolivia, on the ground that it belonged to the old Capitinate of Chili; but Bolivia is actually in possession of Cobija, and claims the coast to the Paposo. In the S., Chili claims not only the coast-line W. of the Andes, but the whole of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego : this claim is contested by the Argentine Re public, and practically the Trans-Andean part of Patagonia is in dependent : nor indeed does it appear that Chili exercises any rights of possession over the Cis-Andean portion. Its area (exclusive of this latter portion and also exclusive of the isles that fringe the coast) is 116,043 sq. m., and its population 1,676,243. Coast-line. \u2014 The coast-line of Chili is remarkably regular down to the Archipelago of Chiloe in 42\u00b0 S. lat., a distance of about 1300 m. It abounds with small bays and river estuaries, which furnish it with a sufficiency, aud even more than sufficiency, of fine harbours, many of which are, however, prejudiced by exposure to the prevailing north winds. The most frequented harbours are Valparaiso, 33\u00b0 2' S. lat., which is good in all respects save the one just noticed ; Coquimbo, 29\u00b0 55', at the mouth of the river of the same name ; and Caldera, 27\u00b0 2', which now serves as the port of Copiapo, and is a fine natural harbour. In addition to these there are good, but unfrequented har bours at Port Flamenco, 20\u00b0 33', Quintero Bay 32\u00b0 45', Concepcion Bay 36\u00b0 40' (first-rate ), Arauco Bay 37\u00b0 15', which is sheltered by the island of Sta. Maria, Port Valdivia 39\u00b0 52', and San Carlos on the island of Chiloe. Mountains and rivers. \u2014 The northern half of Chili to about 31J\u00b0 re sembles Peru in the character of its surface, which consists of the slope of the Andes furrowed by numerous steep valleys running at right angles to' the axis ofthe range and separated by intermediate deserts. The southern portion is of a different character : the rivers hold their mid-courses parallel, more or less, to the Andes, traversing wide, mo derately elevated, and very fertile longitudinal valleys, such as the valley or plain of the Aconcagua, 1 5 m. long, and 13 m. broad, 2600 ft. above the sea ; the plain of Santiago on the banks of the river Maypu ; aud the still more extensive but less cultivated plains between the \u2022d t> 2"], [620, "604 CHILI. Book IV, rivers Maule and Biobio. The two last-mentioned rivers are navigable for a few miles, but the mouth of the Maule is encumbered by a bar : the Calla-calla, on which stands Valdivia, is also navigable. Climate and productions. \u2014 The northern portion of Chili resembles Peru in climate also, being rainless, and for the most part barren, irri gation being attainable in very few spots. The climate of the central region appears to be almost faultless, the heat being tempered by the elevation of the plains and the regular recurrence of the sea-breezes ; a rainy season occurs between May and August. The mean temperature of the plains may be about 70\u00b0. Strong northerly gales prevail during the rainy season, but at other periods southerly winds are more com mon. Earthquakes are of constant occurrence along the coast. The productions of the central region are wheat in large quantities, maize, hemp, quinoa, European fruits, including the vine, orange, peach, and fig, and various vegetables, particularly capsicum. Timber is unknown in the northern regions, but is abundant and of very fine growth in the southern provinces : the Araucaria imbricata is a native of Southern Chili. The mineral resources of the country are considerable ; copper is very abundant in the northern districts, and there are supplies of coal in the central provinces, which enable the inhabitants to smelt the ore on their own soil. Gold-dust is common in the river-beds, and there are silver-mines near Copiapo. Lead, iron, tin, zinc, and a fine quality of sulphur, are also found there. Inhabitants \u2014 Government \u2014 Towns. \u2014 The population of Chili contains a larger proportion of European blood than any other part of South America. The Indians form the majority even here, and are in ex clusive possession of all that lies S. of the river Biobio: the inde pendent tribes of Araucauia (as the region between 37\u00b0 and 42\u00b0 S. lat. is called) are variously estimated at from 10,000 to 80,000. European residents or emigrants are to be found in Chili to the number of about 20,000, chiefly English, Germans, and French. Agriculture and mining are the chief occupations. There are 1668 mines of copper, 268 ot silver, and 668 of coal at work, employing 23,743 miners. Manufac tures are almost entirely restricted to smelting and working copper and iron. Commerce is active, the exports consisting of wheat and barley, copper and silver, hides, wool, and timber. The imports from Great Britain are on a large and an increasing scale. The government is settled and effective : it is a Republic, with a president, who holds office for 5 years, a Senate of 20 members, and a Chamber of Deputies chosen by the people at the rate of 1 for every 20.000 souls. The po litical divisions consist of 14 provinces aud a colony : of the provinces it is only necessary to observe that Chiloe includes not only the island of that name, but the whole Archipelago to the S. of it and the strip of coast under the Andes ; and that the new province of Llanquihue comprises the former colony of that name, with parts of Valdivia and Chiloe. The other colony, to which reference is made above, is on the Strait of Magellan at Punta Arenas, and has only 153 inhabitants. The capital is Santiago (80,000), well situated on the plain of the same name, and on the banks of tbe Maypocho, an affluent of the Maypu, surrounded by an embankment which serves the double purpose of protecting the city from inundation and furnishing a public promenade to the inhabitants ; Santiago contains a university and several large convents, a now disused mint, aud other public buildings : it was founded in 1541, and is a handsome and healthy town. Valparaiso (75,000), the commercial metropolis of Chili. 60 m. N.W. of Santiago,"], [621, "Chap. XXVIs. ISLANDS \u2014 PATAGONIA. 605 occupies a confined site1 between tbe shore and cliffs, but has a large Buburb, Almendral, on the adjacent heights, where most ofthe merchants live. We may further notice from N. to S. : \u2014 Copiapo, the centre of a mining district, a place which bas suffered terribly from earthquakes ; Coquimbo or La Serena, a town of similar character, with copper smelt ing works ; Aconcagua or San Felipe ; Concepcion, which was shattered by the earthquake of 1835 ; and Valdivia. Port Mont, ou the Strait of Ancud, deserves notice as a modern European settlement, chiefly of Germans. Railways connect Santiago with Valparaiso, and Copiapo with Caldera ; and lines are in progress between Coquimbo and Valpa raiso, and between Santiago and the southern provinces. Islands. \u2014 Chiloe is the most northerly of a group of 84 islands of varying size which line the coast from the Strait of Ancud southwards: it is 120 m. long, 60 m. broad, mountainous, well-wooded; possessing a fertile soil, and occupied in the N. by Europeans whose chief settle ment is at Ancud or San Carlos, on the N. coast. Chili further pos sesses the two islands of Juan Fernandez, 403 m. away from her coast, and distinguished from each other by the names Mas-a-Tierra and Mas a-Fuera (nearer to and farther from the mainland): the former, to which the name of Juan Fernandez more particularly adheres, was the solitary abode of Alexander Selkirk in 1705-9, and is now occupied by about 50 settlers : its valleys are fertile and its woods valuable. Cape Horn. Patagonia. \u2014 Patagonia is the name of the S. angle from the Rio Negro to the Strait of Magellan, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, with an area of about 300,000 sq. m., and a thin population of about 30,000. The Andes divide it unequally into a narrow rugged strip of coast on the W., and a series of broad terraces and spreading plains with lakes ' The name Valparaiso (the \" Valley of Paradise\") is not borne out by the scenery ofthe spot \u2022 it rather expresses the feelings of satisfaction experienced by the early mariners at finding a secure haven after the stormy seas about Cape Horn."], [622, "606 ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. Book IV. and morasses, on the E. The country is of little value, and the con flicting claims of Chili and the Argentine Republic to its possession are not likely to be put in force. The E. coast offers good harbourage at the ports of San Antonio and San Josef, in the Gulf of San Matias; at Bahia Nueva, a little more S. ; and at Port San Julian, in 49\u00b0 20' S. lat. Very few spots appear to be adapted for settlement : the banks of the river Chupat and San Julian are among the most promising. The Indian tribes were named Patagonians by Magelhaeus from the resem blance of their feet, encased in sandals of hide, to the hoofs of an animal (pata). The majority of them are men of good stature, but the reports of their gigantic height appear to be unfounded. They live by hunt ing, and are in the lowest state of civilization, wearing hardly any clothes, and being fierce and treacherous. Tierra del Fuego. \u2014 Tierra del Fuego, ' ' the land of Fire \" (so named by Magelhaeus in consequence of the number of beacon-fires he ob served on the coast), is the largest of an archipelago of islands which includes Staten off the S.E. angle, Navarin, Hoste, and Woollaston, in the S.W., separated from the mainland by Beagle Channel, and others again off the W. coast. Cape Horn, the most southerly of the Hermit Islands, is a black pyramidal mass of bare rock. Tierra del Fuego itself has an area of about 18,280 sq. m., is mountainous and well wooded in the W., with snow-clad summits and glaciers occasionally reaching to the coast, a tempestuous and cold climate, and a population at the lowest possible stage of physical and intellectual development : they are called Pesherahs. S. of Cape Horn lies the isolated group of Diego Ramirez (56\u00b0 37' S. lat.). \u00a7 4. Argentine. Republic. \u2014 The Argentine Republic holds the greater part of the basin of the La Plata, the name 2 itself (derived from argentum, \"silver\") being the Latin equivalent for the Spanish Plata. It extends from the Chilian Andes to the Uruguay and the Atlantic, and from the Rio Negro in the S. to the Bolivian frontier in the N., the area within these limits equalling 826,800 sq. m., and the population 1,377,000. It further claims the Gran Chaco in the N. (also claimed by Bolivia and Paraguay), and Pata gonia in the S., which is really independent : the addition of these would bring up the area to 896,900 sq. m. Natural Features. \u2014 The coast-line of the Argentine Republic em braces the southern side of the estuary of the La Plata and the coast of the Atlantic between the La Plata and the Rio Negro. Throughout this whole length the accommodation for shipping ia indifferent, the shore being generally unapproachable from the shoal ing of the water, and being elsewhere lined with low cliffs or sand dunes. The most noticeable features are Eanborombon Bay ; Cape Cor rientes, the extremity of a range of downs ; the Bay of Bahia Blanca, with the estuary of Belgrano ; Anegada Bay, S. of the Colorado ; and San Bias Bay. The only decidedly good harbour is Port Belgrano, in 2 The name 'La Plata' is itself a mis nomer, attributed to Cabot, who found the Indians about the confluence of the Pa raguay and Vermejo in possession of large quantities of gold and silver obtained from Peru : he may have thought that one of the branches of the Eio de la Plata ted up to the Peruvian mines, and in this he would not have been far wrong."], [623, "Chap. XXVII. MOUNTAINS, PLAINS, ETC. 607 Bahia Blanca : Union Bay, S. ofthe Colorado, affords moderate accommo dation ; San Bias, otherwise good, has some quality in its water delete rious to shipping. The navigation of -the Rio de La Plata is impeded by shoals and banks : vessels of large size lie in the ' outer roads ' 7 m. from Buenos Ayres ; smaller ones reach the ' inner roads ' about 2J m. from the city : the water shoals to such an extent that no boats can reach the land, and passengers have to be brought ashore in carts. Mountains, Plains, and Rivers. \u2014 The western slope of the Andes falk within the Argentine Republic, together with the broad extent of high lands about the 24th parallel, including the Despoblado aud Yavi pla teaus, and the high valleys of Vspallata, Guandacol, and Famatina, which have been already noticed in \u00a7 2 of the previous chapter. From the E. verge of this region the level descends by broad terraces, such as those of the Gran Chaco about the Vermejo to the Salado and the Paraguay ; Tucuman, below the Aconquija range ; and Rioja, S.W. of the Dolce, at the extremity of which is the Sierra de Cordova in 64\"-65\u00b0 W. long. Detached altogether from the Andean system is the ridge of high ground between the Parana and Uruguay, and again the isolated ranges of Sierra del Vuulcan and Sierra Ventana (3500 ft.) near the Atlantic coast. Vast plains occupy the remainder of the countiy to the extent of 5-6ths of the whole area ; to the N. of 33\u00b0 they are for the most part barren, and occasionally saline,3 this latter feature being common in the Travesia W. of the Rio Dolce, a depressed basin hardly above the level of the sea though 700 m. removed from it, which is covered with Salinas or saline efflorescences. S. of 33\u00b0 the Pampas stretch awTay in an unbroken series to the Rio Negro, devoid of trees, but producing luxuriant crops of grass supporting vast numbers of horses, cattle, and sheep, and yielding good crops of grain under culture. The plains extend to the foot of the Andes, but they are not all of the proper Pampa character : on the route between Buenos Ayres and Valparaiso, the plains immediately W. of Buenos Ayres are covered with thistles : then follows the grassy region ; swamps and bogs prevail between the 64 th and 67th meridians : then a rough country covered with ashes and thorny plants, which reaches to Mendoza, and which becomes fertile under irrigation. The most important rivers of this country belong to the basin of the La Plata: it holds the 1. bank of the Parana to the confluence of the Paraguay, and thence both banks to tlie La Plata, together with the whole course of its important affluent, the Salado; the rt. bank of the Paraguay to the Bolivian frontier, and so much of the Vermejo and Pilcomayo as it can assert its right to. S. of the La Plata, the Salado, the Colorado, and the Rio Negro hold independent courses to the Atlantic, the two latter risipg in the Andes, and the first on a ridge of high ground which is a northern continuation of the Sierra Vuulcan. Many of the rivers of the plain terminate in lakes, aud have their waters absorbed by evaporation : this is the case with the Dolce, which forms Lake Salados ; the Desaguedero, which issues from L. Guanacache, the receptacle of the rivers San Juan and Mendoza, and discharges itself into L. Bevedero ; and the western Salado or Diamante, which falls into the Drre-Lauquen : all these lakes are more or less saline. The river Tunuyan, in the same region, dis charges its waters partly into the Bevedero, and partly by the Rio Nuevo into the Salado. The Lagune d'Ybera, a large morass between the Parana and the Uruguay, is attributed to infiltration from the former river. \u00bb The river-name ' Salado ' betokens the presence of salt."], [624, "608 ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. Book IV. Climate and productions. \u2014 The temperature of the Pampas is subject to violent fluctuations : the prevailing north winds are hot and relaxing, and have a remarkably irritating effect on the nervous system; but these are frequently interrupted by the Pamperos, violent gales from the S.W. which sweep with incredible fury across the plain from the Andes, accompanied with thunder-storms and clouds of dust which produce a palpable darkness. The mean temperature at Buenos Ayres (the place of \"good air\") is about 62\u00b0, and the summer and winter temperatures range about 10\u00b0 on each side of the mean. Rain is abun dant ou the Eastern Pampas, but scanty on the Western. The tem perature of the northern plain, particularly the Travesia, is excessively hot and oppressive : the higher terraces, such as Tucuman, are tem perate and healthy ; the high plateaus exhibit every variety of climate, the Despoblado region being severely cold. The productions of so vast a district, with such wide differences of altitude, must be of course very various. The Pampas, in their natural state, yield nothing beyond Gaucho lassoing CatUe. grasses, thistles (which attain a gigantic height, concealing even a man on horseback), and an occasional ombu tree. The soil itself repays culture, and in the neighbourhood of the towns good crops of maize, wheat, barley, and vegetables are grown. Elsewhere the Pampas are devoted to pasture, some to sheep-walks, which now extend to about 150 m. round Buenos Ayres, while the rest is given up to cattle and horses, of which there are vast numbers, in a semi-wdd state, belonging to the \" estancias \" or farming-stations. The Upper Provinces have a sub-tropical vegetation, and produce rice, tobacco, the sugar-cane, manioc, &c. : the river-banks and mountain slopes are well-clothed with forests, among which are many valuable trees, such as the alga roba or earob-tree, the coca, and the mate' or Paraguay tea-plant. The cochineal-cactus and the aloe are also frequent ; and are largely used as fences. Tucumau appears to be the most fertile part of the upper pro vinces, and is styled the \"Garden of South America.\" The western provinces. Mendoza, Salta, and San Juan, manufacture wine. The Andean district is rich in minerals \u2014 gold in San Juan, San Luis, and"], [625, "Chap. XXVII. INHABITANTS, DIVISIONS, ETC. 609 Mendoza ; silver in Uspallata, Famatina, and the Mountains of Cor- dova ; copper in Catamarca; petroleum at Guanapatal in Jujuy; and coal in San Juan ; but these resources are unavailable for want of good communications. Inhabitants \u2014 Government\u2014 Commerce, fye. \u2014 The European element is probably stronger in the population of the Argentine Republic than in any other part of South America. The Indians hold territories in the N. on the Gran Chaco and in the S. along the Rio Negro, and in these parts their numbers are estimated at 40,000. They are numerous in the mountainous districts, where they live on good terms with the whites, and only a few tribes retain their independence. The eastern Pampas are held almost exclusively by Europeans : the Gaucho3, as the herdsmen of these plains are named, are a peculiar class, living almost entirely in the saddle, wonderfully expert at the use of the lasso, faithful to their masters, but wild and thriftless. In addition to these and other descendants of the Spaniards, a considerable immigration has set in from Europe, induced, as far as the English are concerned, by the agricultural capabilities of the country. The Italians are by far the most numerous (70,000) ; the British number 32,000, chiefly en- gaged in sheep-farming ; and there are about the same number of Spaniards and French, the latter being engaged as slaughtermen in Buenos Ayres, and as shopkeepers. The Argentine Republic is a con- federation of States, somewhat loosely connected, retaining the ma- nagement of their internal affairs, and having the usual mechanism for the maintenance of their common interests \u2014 a President, a Senate, and a House of Deputies, with Buenos Ayres at present for the seat of go- vernment. The wealth of the country consists in its animal produc- tions, sheep, cattle, and horses ; these furnish its leading exports, wool, hides, and tallow. Portions of the oxen are prepared as food in the form of jerked meat, but the bulk of the carcase is boiled down for tallow; and even horses, or at least mares, which are never used for riding, are killed for the sake of the tallow extracted from them. The exports are chiefly to North Germany (through Antwerp), France, the United States, and Great Britain ; in the imports Great Britain stands first, sending textile fabrics, hardware, &c. ; then follow in order France (wine, brandy, millinery), Brazil (sugar, tobacco, yerba mate), the United States (timber), Spain, &c. Political Divisions \u2014 Towns. \u2014 The Argentine Republic consists of 14 States or Provinces, named for the most part after their respective capitals. The northern provinces are generally designated the Upper provinces from their greater altitude : under this title are included Cordova, La Rioja, Santiago del Estero, Tucuman, Catamarca, Salta, and Jujuy. The Lower or Riverine provinces are Buenos Ayres, Santa F6, Entre Rios, and Corrientes. The Western provinces are San Luis, San Juan, and Mendoza. Buenos Ayres (200,000) the capital of the Re- public stands on the S. shore ofthe La Plata, about 150 m. from the sea ; its site is moderately elevated above the water, and the town is spacious and contains some fine churches : it is the chief outlet for the produce of the Republic and the seat of many educational and scien- tific institutions. The Saladeros or slaughter-houses at Buenos Ayres are on a very large scale. Buenos Ayres was taken by the British iii 1806, again attacked by them in 1807, blockaded by the French in 1838, and has been several times the scene of revolutionary struggles. Eosario (30 000), on the Parana, is the next most important town and the place of export for the interior provinces ; when the lines of com- * 2 d 3"], [626, "610 PARAGUAY. Book IV. munication are opened with the interior, it is likely to rise yet higher. Santa Fe (15,000) is well placed at the confluence of the Salado and Parana. The other chief towns are found on the two great commercial routes, which communicate in one direction with Bolivia and Peru, in the other with Santiago in Chili: the first passing through Cordova (25,000), formerly the ecclesiastical metropolis of the whole region, now an important commercial entrepot ; Santiago del Estero s6000), on the Dolce ; Tucuman ( 1 1 , 000) on an upper branch of the same river ; Salta (11,300), in a valley under the Despoblado Andes; and Jujuy (6900;, an important military position in the \"throat \" (Garganta) of the passes to Peru. The Chilian route crosses the Pampas through the towns of San Luis (5000), and Mendoza (18,000), the latter a well-built town, standing at an elevation of 2891 ft. near the foot ofthe Andes. Communications. \u2014 The Argentine States, and particularly Buenos Ayres, have made some progress in railway formation. The chief lines completed or in course of completion are: \u2014 (1) The Western, from Buenos Ayres to Chivilcoy (100 m.), the centre of an agricultural region. (2) The Southern, from Buenos Ayres to Chascomus (75 m.), in a sheep-farming region. (3) The Northern, from Buenos Ayres to Tigre (IS m.). (4) The Central Argentine, to connect Cordova with Rosario on the Parana, open between Rosario and Frayle Muerto (123 m.). \u00a7 5. Paraguay. \u2014 Paraguay is a wholly inland State, situated, as its name implies, on the river Paraguay. Its extent is more than usually uncertain ; the area generally conceded to it is one of about 70,000 sq. m. between the rivers Paraguay and Parana from their con fluence northwards. In addition to this, however, Paraguay claims (1) a large slice of the Gran Chaco W. of the Paraguay, which would bring its area to 126,000 sq. m. ; (2) a territory E. of the Parana to the watershed between it and the Uruguay ; and (3) a considerable extension northwards between the Parana and Paraguay. These would bring up its area to 352,500 sq. m. The population assigned to it is 1,337,439. Natural Features, &c. \u2014 Little is known of the interior of Paraguay : a chain of mountains, called the Sierra de Amambahy forms the water shed between the two great rivers. The Paraguay is the great me dium of communication with the outer world ; it is navigable for vessels of 300 tons to Asuncion, and enables the State to make some show as a naval power on these inland waters. The Parana is not navigable for more than 1 20 m. above its confluence with the Paraguay. The climate is hot and humid, the mean temperature of Asuncion being 85\u00b0, with an occasional rise to 100\u00b0 ; the rainfall is sufficient but not excessive. The forests are magnificent, and produce, in addition to timber and dye-woods, tbe mate' or Paraguay tea, being the leaf of an evergreen (the Ilex Paraguayensis) about the size of an orange-tree. Manioc, batatas, yuccas, sugar-cane, sarsaparilla, cotton, and tobacco, are among the cultivated crops. The exports are Paraguay tea, which is quite the specialty of the country, hides, and tobacco. Inhabitants \u2014 Government \u2014 Towns. \u2014 The Indians form the great bulk of the population, the chief tribe being the Guarauis, whose language is current everywhere except in the capital. The government is nomi-"], [627, "CHAP. XXVII. URUGUAY \u2014 BRAZIL. 611 nally republican, but really a dictatorship, the President holding office for life, and having even the privilege of nominatin, ; his successor pro tern, after his death until the election of a new President by the Na tional Congress. The distinctive feature in the policy of the govern ment is extreme jealousy of Brazil, with whom there has been a pro tracted struggle. The country is divided into 25 departments. The capital, Asuncion (8000), founded in 1536, stands on the Paraguay, and is furnished with a dockyard, cathedral, &c. Villarica, 90 m. S.W. of Asuncion, is surrounded by a large maU district. \u00a7 6. Uruguay. \u2014 The position of Uruguay is tolerably well defined by its full name of Banda Oriental del Uruguay, \" the eastern bank of the river Uruguay ;\" it holds the 1. or E. bank of that river from the confluence of the Ibicuy in the N. to the La Plata in the S., and has a seaboard on the Atlantic from the mouth of the La Plata to 33\u00b0 40' S. lat. Its area is 66,700 sq. m., and its population 240,965. Natural features, &e. \u2014 The N. coast-line of the Rio de la Plata is irregular and offers harbourage at several spots. The harbour of Maldonado, sheltered by the isle of Gorriti, is probably the best; that of Montevideo, the most frequented in the country, is exposed to the Pamperos and is shallow; Colonia, opposite Buenos Ayres, is good. The interior consists of undulating table-lands intersected with hills of moderate elevation (here termed Cochillas), which terminate S. on the very edge of the La Plata, aud E. towards the Atlantic at about 50 m. from the coast. A depression in these highlands occurs at the basin of the Eio Negro, the chief affluent of the Uruguay in the Re public. The Uruguay is navigable for a considerable distance above the confluence of the Rio Negro. The climate is temperate, and rain is sufficiently abundant. The table-lands are only adapted for pasture, and the chief wealth of the country consists in its cattle, horses, and sheep. The lower grounds in the valleys produce grain, rice, hemp, sugar-cane, cotton, and various fruits and vegetables. A fair amount of commerce is carried on from Monte-Video in hides, horns, wool, tallow, &c. The Government is a republic. Monte- Video (45,765), the capital, is well placed on a peninsula which forms the E. barrier of its harbour, and which is connected on the mainland with the hill whence it derives its name : the town is open and healthy, but badly supplied with water : it was taken by the English in 1806 and by the Brazilians in 1821, and was besieged by the Buenos Ayreans in 1843-47. Buenos Ayres regards it as her rival. The other chief towns are Maldonado and Colonia, the seaports already noticed, and Paysandu, a river-port on the Uruguay. \u00a7 7. Brazil. \u2014 Boundaries \u2014 Area and Population \u2014 Coast line and Harbours. \u2014 Brazil occupies the great easterly protrusion of South America from C. Orange, 4\u00b0 25' N. lat. at the mouth of the Oyapok river to Lake Mirim in 32\u00b0 40' S. lat. Westward it extends along the course of the Amazons to the confluence of the Javari in 70\u00b0 W. long., and has a breadth of about 2500 m. at a point slightly S. of the 5th parallel.

Book IV. on the 3 Guyanas and Venezuela, \"W. on New Granada, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia ; and S. on Paraguay, the Argentine Republic, and Uruguay. So extended a frontier must ultimately involve Brazil in border disputes; but at present the ground is so thinly occupied that the contingency has only arisen on the side of Paraguay. The area of Brazil is estimated at 3,231,000 sq. m., and its population at 8,500,000. Coast-line and harbours. \u2014 The coast-line of Brazil is generally low and regular, the chief exception to this being the section between the Morro de S. Marta, 31\u00b0 S. lat., and the Bay do Espirito Santo, 20\u00b0 25\", which is high and rocky, especially between Santos and C. Frio, where it is bordered by the Serra do Mar. There are no bays of large extent, unless we regard as such Formosa Bay, 22\u00b0 30'. Nor are smaller in dentations, which would serve as harbours, by any means numerous. There are, however, two deserving especial notice : the one is the Bay of Eio Janeiro,4 which, having a narrow entrance of about a mile's breadth between two rocky points, expands into a spaeious land-locked basin, capable of holding the navies of the world, and remarkable for the beauty of its appearance, surrounded as it is by an amphitheatre of mountains and studded with islands. The other is Bahia de Todos os Santos or \"All Saints' Bay,\" 12\u00b0 42' S. lat., which has an entrance 8 m. broad and expands to a breadth of 27 m. and a length of 37 m., with excellent anchoring ground and numerous islands. The Bays of Santos, 24\u00b0, and Espirito Santo, 20\u00b0 20', are both less capacious and more open. In other quarters the harbours are formed either by islands, reefs, or estuaries ; Recife (Pernambuco) by its very name attributes its harbour to the remarkable chain of reefs which skirts the shore, inside of which there is safe but somewhat shallow water : Maijayo, the chief port in Alagoas, 9\u00b0 33', has a harbour of similar construction. The harbours formed by coast islands are S. Catharina, 27\u00b0 35', one of the best on the whole coast; Santos, 24 \u00b0, on an isle in the bay of the same name; Angra, 23\u00b0, W. of Rio Janeiro; Victoria, 20\u00b0 20', in the Bay of Espirito Santo ; and the Bays of S. Jose and S. Marcos formed by Maranhao off the N. coast. Of the estuary harbours the most important is Para, 1\u00b0 18' S. lat., at the confluence ofthe Guama with the Para, 70 m. from the sea. Natal, on the Rio Grande, 5\u00b0 45', is shallow, but has a con siderable coasting trade. The most noticeable capes from S. to N. are Frio, somewhat E. of Rio Janeiro, San Tliome, 22^, San Agostinho near Recife, 8\u00b0 15', and San Roque, 5\u00b0 20'. Mountains, Plains and Rivers. \u2014An extensive highland occupies the central and eastern parts of Brazil, rising on the 1. bank of the Madeira in the Cordillera Geral, 12\u00b0 S. lat. and 64\u00b0 W. long., and thence ex panding to the N.E. and S.W. until it terminates on the side ofthe Atlantic in ranges that fringe the eoast at intervals between the Parana hiba in the N. and the Rio de la Plata in the S. The central line of elevation in this highland separates the basins of the Amazons and the La Plata, and is appropriately termed the Serra dos Vertentes, \"Water shed range : \" it deviates S. in a V form between the Paraguay and the Paranahiba, so that the Araguay basin is interposed between these two. At its E. extremity the Serra dos Vertentes connects with ranges named it the \" River of Januarius,\" having landed on the feast-day of that saint. \u00ab The discoverer of this bay, Alfonso de Souza, ihought it to be a river-cstuary, and"], [629, "Chap. XXVII. MOUNTAINS, PLAINS, ETC. 613 running more or less at right angles to it and parallel to the sea. The most inland of these is the high range which bounds the basin of the San Francisco on the W., and is known as the Serra da Tabatinga ; this forks off in about 8\u00b0 S. lat. into two branches, which enclose the basins of the Jaguaribe and other rivers in the E. angle of the con tinent. Connected with the Serra da Tabatinga by a transverse range at the head of the San Francisco basin is another line of heights run ning parallel to it on the other side of the San Francisco, and separating its valley from the coast region : this is known as the Serra de Espin ha?o, or \"Spinal range.\" To the S. of the transverse range already noticed another pair of parallel ranges is found, but in closer con tiguity than the more northerly pair : the inland range is named Serra da Mantigueira and the maritime one Serra do Mar, with the more specific title of Serra dos Orgaos, \" Organ Mountains,\" near Rio Janeiro, where the outline bears some resemblance to the pipes of an organ. The highest summit in Brazil is the Pico dos Orgaos (7700 ft.) in Mantigueira, near the source of the Parahiba. In the N.W. of Brazd the S. edge of the Parime highlands forme the line of sepa ration between it and Guyana, and also bounds the basin of the Amazons in that direction. A vast lowland plain occupies the interval between the Parime' and the Brazilian highlands, extend ing E. and W. from the Atlantic to the foot of the Andes and traversed by the Amazons and its tributary rivers. To the N. of the main stream the basin is of no great extent ; to the S. it penetrates deeply into the highland, reaching along the Araguay to 18\u00b0 S. lat., and on this side the verge of the highland is marked by falls and rapids. The Amazons has been already described in the preceding chapter \u00a7 3 : its affluents on the rt. bank in Brazil are the Javari, the Jurua, the Purus, whicb three have their sources in Bolivia, the Madeira, one branch of which, the Guapore, rises in Brazil, the Tapajos, the Xingu, and the Tocantins, which is composed of two long branches, the Tocan tins proper and the Araguay. On its 1. bank the Amazons receives the Eio Negro, which is connected with the Orinoco by the Cassiquiare. To the S. of tho watershed range are found the bead-waters of the Paraguay and Parana, the former traversing a low swampy plain, the latter draining a more elevated region on the slopes of the Serra Espinha<;o and the Mantigueira ranges, between which two the main stream Eio Grande takes its rise, while the more northerly branch is named the Paranahiba. Of the other Brazilian rivers we may notice the Sao Francesco, which in its upper and middle courses flows parallel to the sea between the ridges already described and bends round E. and S.E. as it approaches the sea; its navigation is impeded by the shallowness of its mouths, and by the falls of Paulo Affonso, 160 m. above its mouth ; the Paranahiba, which receives the drainage of the northern ranges, and joins the N. coast ; and lastly, the Belmonte, the Doce, and the southern Parahiba, which rise on the Coast ranges S. of the Sao Francesco. Climate and productions. \u2014 Tbe climate of the coast district of Brazil is agreeable and suited to Europeans, although lying for the most part within the tropics. Rio de Janeiro, very nearly under the southern tropic, has a mean temperature of 73\u00b0 7', with a variation of about 5\u00b0 for the means of summer and winter. At Porto Seguro, nearer the equator, the mean temperature is yet lower. The lowlands of the Amazons have a superabundance of moisture, rain falling almost every day: the temperature here rises to above 100\u00b0. The table-lands,"], [630, "614 BRAZIL. Book IV. on the other hand, have a more regular interchange of dry and wet seasons, and a moderate temperature. The vegetation of Brazil is of the most rich and varied character; vast forests cover the plains of the Amazons and the slopes of the maritime ranges. These yield various cabinet-woods and dye-woods, particularly brazil-wood,6 logwood, fustic, and rose-wood. Palm-trees of every variety abound, par ticularly in the north. The caoutchouc-tree (siphonia elastica) is a native of Brazil. Among the minor vegetable products we may mentiou cacao, sarsaparilla, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, copaiba, and copal. Parasitical creepers are a distinguishing feature of the forests. A very small proportion of the soil is cultivated : maize, manioc, rice, bananas, cotton, coffee, sugar-cane, and tobacco are the most important crops. Vast herds of cattle depasture on the table-lands. The minerals in clude diamonds, found mostly in the head-streams of the Parana and Sao Francesco, the mining-towns in each of these districts being named Diamantina, one of which is in the province of Minas-Geraes, the other in Matto-Grosso, 90 m. N.W. of Cuyaba ; topazes (about Ouro Preto), amethysts, gold in various parts, platinum (in the Sao Francesco basin), iron, copper, &c. Several of the mines are worked by English companies. A large coal-field has been discovered in Santa Catharina. \u00a7 8. Inhabitants \u2014 Government \u2014 Political Divisions \u2014 Towns. \u2014 The estimates of the population of Brazil vary considerably, parti cularly as regards the independent Indian tribes : the relative pro portions of the various elements are also very uncertain. There are probably about 1| million of negro slaves, and half a million of inde pendent Indians ; mixed races make up the bulk of the remainder \u2014 Mulattoes, Mamalucoes (as the progeny of Europeans and Indians are here called), Caribocoes (negroes and Indians), and Cubras (Mu lattoes and negroes). The Whites are roughly estimated at a mil lion, and include Brazileiros (Portuguese Creoles) and foreigners settled in Brazil, chiefly Germans and Swiss. Slavery continues in Brazil, but the importation of slaves is prohibited. The vast number of blacks (free and slave) already in Brazil, threatens to convert it in course of time into a negro state. The amalgamation of the various races in Brazil is more complete than in any other part of America, and the highest offices are open to all. Many of the Indian tribes are in the lowest stage of barbarism : others are semi-civilized, and practise agriculture : others are wholly civilized, and converted to Christianity. Government, &c. \u2014 Brazil is a constitutional Empire, the legislative power being vested in a Congress of 2 Chambers \u2014 a Senate of 58 members elected for life, and a House of Representatives of 113 members elected for 4 years. The emperor acts through responsible ministers. The provinces have each its own legislative congress. The resources of the country are mainly agricultural, and secondarily s This wood was so named from its brilliantly glowing colour (Portuguese bsaza, 'live coals'). The name,first given by King Emanuel, in lieu of the name Santa Cruz, given to it by its discoverer, Cabral. to the wood, was assigned to the country"], [631, "615 Chap. XXVII. GOVERNMENT, DIVISIONS, ETC. mining. The commerce is very considerable, tbe most important articles of export being sugar, cotton, and coffee, and the less im- portant, tobacco, hides, ornamental woods, and india-rubber. About one half of the commerce of the country (export and import) is carried on with Great Britain, and the other half is divided between France, the United States, the Argentine Republic, Portugal, Prussia, and other countries. Brazil suffers much from defective communications : a few railways are in course of construction to convey the produce of the interior to the ports of Recife, Bahia, &c. Political Divisions and Towns.\u2014 Brazil is divided into 20 provinces and one district. The district consists of the city of Rio de Janeiro and its environs, which, like the Columbia of the United States, are neutral ground as far as the provinces are concerned. The provinces S. of Rio are Sao Paulo, Parana, Santa Catharina, and Rio Grande do Sui : the provinces N. of Rio along the coast, Espirito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco, Parahiba, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceara, Piauhy, Maranhao, Para, and Amazonas ; and the provinces of the in- terior, Minas Geraes, Goyaz, and Matto Grosso. The capital is Rio-de- Janeiro (296,136), near the W. entrance of the beautiful bay of the same name, and consisting of two parts, an Old Town founded in 1567, and a New Town founded in 1808, with a wide space, called the Campo do Honra, intervening between them : the site is varied, and the churches are numerous, and possess in many instances highly deco- rated interiors. Half of the foreign commerce of Brazil is conducted at Rio. Bahia or San Salvador (125,000) was the capital of Brazil until 1763, and is now a very active port; the town is not in a flourishing condition : it consists of an Upper and Lower Town, the latter by the beach where the business is transacted, the former at an elevation of from 100 to 300 ft., and containing the fines church in the coun- try and other public buildings. Eecife (68,000'' is an aggregation of 4 towns : Recife proper, on a peninsula, containing the wharfs and merchants' offices ; Sao Antonio, on an island connected with it by a bridge ; Boa Vista, on the mainland ; and the now sunken Olinda, some 3 m. distant. Para or Belem (20,000) is the chief emporium for the produce of the Amazons basin. Maranhao (30,000), on the island of the same name, is a place of considerable importance for the export of rice, cotton, and sarsaparilla. We may further notice from S. to N. \u2014 Porto Alegre (12,000), at the N. extremity of the Lake Dos Patos, the commercial entrep6t and capital of the province of Rio Grande do Sui ; Curitiba (12,000), the capital of Parana ; Sao Paulo (22,032), 28 m. from the coast and 220 m. W. of Rio, on the W. slope of the Serra do Mar, an active and flourishing town ; Sorocaba (12,000), 50 m. N.W. of Sao Paulo ; Ouro Preto (9000), the capital of Minas Geraes, 200 m. N.W. of Rio, the centre of a mining district ; Goyaz or Villa Boa (8000), in the very centre of the country, a well-built provincial capital ; Cuyaba (10,000), the capital of Matto Grosso, and a place of large in- land trade ; Victoria (5800), the capital of Espirito Santo, already no- ticed as a port ; Porto Seguro, the place where Alvarez Cabral landed in 1500 and took possession ofthe country for the king of Portugal ; Caxoeira (15,000), 60 m. N.W. of Bahia, in a district producing much coffee and tobacco ; Parahiba (15,000), the port and capital of the pro vince of the same name; Natal (10,000), the port ofthe Rio Grande do Norte and the capital of its provmce ; Araoatr, the most important town in Ceara, on the navigable river Jaguanbe; Paranahiba (10,000), near the mouth of the river of the same name, the outlet ot the pro-"], [632, "616 GUIANA. Book IV. duce of Piauhy ; and Santarem (5000), on the Tapajos, a depot for the produce of that part of the Amazons basin. Besides the shore-islands already noticed, Brazil possesses Fernando do Noronha, 125 m. E. of C. Roche, used as a penal settlement. \u00a7 9. Guiana. \u2014 The name Guiana or Guyana (for the two forms are used indifferently, the former approximating to the Portuguese Guianna, and the latter to the Spanish Ouayana) is applied in its widest sense to the whole region between the Amazons and the Orinoco, parts of which are attached to Brazil and Venezuela. The coast between the Oyapok on the side of Brazil and the southern most point of the delta of the Orinoco in the N.W. belongs to what may be termed Colonial Guiana, being held by tbe European nations of Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands. Inland, this district narrows up to an angle about where the 59th meridian intersects the 1st parallel of N. lat. The Acarai and Tumuenraque Mts. form the S. boundary, the Arimagua and Paoaraima Mts. the W. boundary. The Dutch hold a central position, between the Maroni and Corentyn rivers, with the French on the E. and the British on the W. The areas and populations of the several por tions are estimated thus : \u2014 Historical Geography. \u2014 The Dutch have been the most persistent and effective settlers in Guiana. They took possession of it in 1580, and established prosperous colonies on the Essequibo, the Corentyn, and the Berbice. The British settled on the Surinam in 1638, but were compelled to retire before the Dutch in 1667. The French established themselves on the Sinnamary in 1626. In the Revolutionary War Great Britain seized the Dutch possessions, and by the peace of Paris she retained so much as is now included in British Guiana. Natural Features \u2014 Climate and Productions. \u2014 The maritime portion of Guiana, to a depth inland of from 40 to 70 m., consists of alluvial flats, which require drainage in order to bring them into cultivation, and are naturally covered with dense forests. At the back of these flats the ground rises by terraces to the Parime Mountains. The coast itself is low and fringed with mud-banks : the rivers are the only openings available for shipping. Of these the Essequibo stands first in point of size : it rises in the extreme S. angle of Guiana, and tra verses the central parts of British Guiana, receiving the Cuyuiri with the Massaruny from the W., and entering the sea by a broad estuary with several large islands in it : this river is almost inaccessible from the shoals and mud-banks about its mouth. The other rivers of British Guiana are the Demerara and the Berbice (pronounced Berbeese), Area in sq. m. Population. British Guiana .

The Corentyn, which sepa rates the British and Dutch Guianas, is navigable for 150 m. The Surinam belongs wholly to Dutch Guiana and is navigable for large ships up to Panamaribo. Very little is known of the Maroni, which separates Dutch from French Guiana, or of the Oyapok on the Brazilian frontier. The climate is good, the temperature being mode rated by the humidity of the air and the refreshing sea-breezes : the thermometer ranges between 75\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, the mean temperature at George Town being 81\u00b0. There are two wet seasons, between No vember and February, and between April and September. The sea ports are occasionally visited with yellow fever, but the interior is free from this scourge. The forests of Guiana contain many valuable woods for building, cabinet, and dye purposes. The soil of the coast region is a deep ailu vium and wonderfully rich. The cultivated crops are the sugar-cane, of which there are large plantations in British Guiana, coffee, cotton, arrow-root, cacao, tobacco, indigo, vanilla, and bananas, to which French Guiana adds the capsicum, whence is produced ' Cay enne' pepper. Inhabitants \u2014 Political Divisions \u2014 Towns. \u2014 British Guiana contains about 11,500 whites; the rest ofthe population consists of Negroes and Coolies, of which latter class about 25,000 have been introduced from Asia to supersede the Negroes as labourers. The White popu lation in Dutch Guiana numbers about 40,000, and in French Guiana about 7000. The rest is made up of Indians and Negroes, including under the latter head the Maroons or runaway slaves of the interior. The native Indians are not all included in the returns of the popu lation above given : their number can be only roughly guessed. In British Guiana they have been estimated at 20,000; in Dutch Guiana at 1000; and in French Guiana at 1770. The Maroons or Bush-Negroes are the descendants of runaway slaves since the close of the 17th cent. : they have at times waged desperate wars with their former masters, particularly in 1749, 1772, and 1774 : they now form independent re publics in the southern districts. The government of British Guiana is conducted by (1) a Governor ; (2) a Court of Policy, composed of 5 official and 5 elected members, who are chosen by an \"Electoral College \" of 7 members appointed by the people ; and (3) a Combined Court, composed of the members of the Court of Policy, and 6 Finan cial Representatives, elected by the people, and having to deal with taxation and expenditure. The Dutch law prevails in civil cases. The capital of British Guiana is George Town (29,174) on the Demerara river, the entrance of which is defended by Fort William ; its streets are intersected by canals, which take the place of roads in this part of the world. New Amsterdam, on the Berbice, is the only other town in the colony. The capital of Dutch Guiana is Paramaribo (15,843) on the Surinam, about 9 m. from its mouth, a Dutch-looking town, the streets abundantly adorned with rows of orange and lemon trees, and the houses surrounded with gardens, to which the name of the place (meaning \"flower-garden\") refers. The capital of French Guiana is Cayenne (6000), on a shore island formed by the rivers Cayenne and Oyak and a connecting channel ; the adjacent lies du Salut and some spots on the mainland are used as a penal settlement for political offenders ; the climate of Cayenne is unhealthy, and the place has an ill-fame : it has a good and well-fortified port."], [634, "618 FALKLAND ISLANDS. Book IV \u00a7 10. Falkland Isles. \u2014 The Falkland Islands are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 300 m. N.E. of Tierra del Fuego, and consist of two larger, distinguished as East and West Falk land, and above 100 smaller islands, the area of which has not been satisfactorily ascertained.6 These islands are of considerable value to Great Britain as a place of call for provisions and repairs on the route to her Australasian colonies, and also as a whaling station. They have been occupied only since 1833, and their utility is becoming every year more apparent. They have some excellent harbours, of which Port Stanley, on the East island, is the most frequented. The surface is varied, the climate healthy with a mean temperature of 47\u00b0, cattle abundant and the pastures pecu liarly adapted to them (the \" tussack \" grass being indigenous), the fisheries well stocked, &c. Wood is wanting. The population is growing rapidly : it consists of settlers from Buenos Ayres, Indians, and a few Europeans. \u00ab The returns of the Board of Trade give 13,000 sq. m.; the C-nsus of 1861, 7600 sq. m. ; and by some authorities the amount is reduced to 47-il eq. m.

In our country no general name has gained currency for this fifth division, or (as it is somewhat improperly termed) \"fifth quarter\" of the world."], [636, "620 Book V. AUSTRALIA. Australasia,1 which is occasionally used as co-extensive with it, has also a more restricted meaning as applied to Australia and the sur rounding islands, the remainder being described under the general term of Polynesia. The adoption of the term \" Oceania \" would there fore supply a deficiency in our geographical nomenclature. Various subdivisions of Oceania have been proposed : the one most generally adopted is a fourfold division into Malaysia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia \u2014 the two first referring to ethnographical considera tions, Malaysia being the islands held by the Malays, and Melane sia those occupied by the Papuas ; while the two last refer to the natural features of the island groups, Micronesia meaning the \" small islands \" which are so numerous to the N. of 8\u00b0 N. lat., and Polynesia the \" multitude of groups,\" exclusive of Micronesia, in the Pacific. The defect in this division is obvious, viz., that it is based on no uniform principle. Setting aside Malaysia, which we have already described under the head of Asia, we shall distribute the remaining portions of Oceania into three groups: \u2014 (1) British Australasia, or the lands in which the British population is dominant (Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand). (2) Melanesia, or the islands N. and E. of Australia, in which the Papua race prevails (New Guinea, New Britain, the Solomon Islands, New Hebrides, New Caledonia, the Fijis).

Australia is favourably situated between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with the islands of Polynesia bearing away E. in the direction of America, and those of Malaysia forming a causeway to connect it with Asia. It is separated from New Guinea by Torres Strait, 90 m. broad ; from Timor and Timor Laut by the Arafura Sea ; and from Tasmania by Bass Strait, 140 m. broad. The E. coast is washed by the Pacific, the W. coast by the Indian Ocean, and the S. coast by the great Southern Ocean.

It stretches through iOh degrees of long, between Cape Byron in 153\u00b0 39' and Steep Point in 113\u00b0 E., 1 The first part of the name Australasia means ' southern ' (from tbe Latin Austra lia), and is the relic of a theory once current among geographers that there was a mass of land iu the southern hemisphere (a Terra AustraZis) as a counterpoise to the great continent of the northern hemi sphere. When the existence of this conti nent was disproved, the name was applied in the modified form ot Australia to all tho Ulands of this region, and is indeed still so applied by the Germans, who distinguish between continental Australia (our Aus tralia) and insular Australia (Polynesia).

Book V line of Australia is the Gulf of Carpentaria on the N. coast, which penetrates S. for 400 m. between York Peninsula and Arnhem Land, the E. shore being regular and low, the W. indented and fringed with islands. On the S. coast a corresponding but less marked indentation is found in the case of the Great Australian Bight, formed by a wide sweep of the coast between C. Arid and C. Catastrophe, about 600 m. apart. Of the lesser inlets we may notice : \u2014 on the N.W. coast, Van Diemen Gulf on Arnhem Land, between Coburg Peninsula, Melville Island, and the mainland ; Queen's Channel; Cambridge Gulf, which has quite the character of a fiord ; Admiralty Gulf, York Sound, Collier Bay, and King Sound, all of which are more or less beset with islands. On the W. coast, Shark Bay, which is shut in seawards by long spit shaped islands, with an approach to it through Geographe Channel ; and Geographe Bay, bounded S. by C. Naturaliste. On the S. coast, the deep inlets E. of the Great Australian Bight, named Spencer Gulf and St. Vincent Gulf, with Yorke Peninsula between them ; Encounter Bay ; and Port Phillip, a land-locked sheet of water 30 m. long, with an entrance channel only 2 m. across. On the E. coast Twofold Bay, so named as having two bays in it ; Botany Bay ; Port Jackson, a land locked and ramifying sheet of water, entered by a strait about 2 m. wide between two heads or cliffs ; Broken Bay, somewhat more N. ; and Moreton Bay, fronted by the island of the same name. On the N.E. coast are numerous but unfrequented bays, commencing in the S. with Harvey Bay, and ending with Princess Charlotte Bay on York Peninsula. This section of the coast is fringed by a remarkable coral reef known as the Great Barrier Beef, extending through 1 5 degrees of latitude between 24\u00b0 30' and 9\u00b0 15'. Ample harbourage is afforded by the bays above noticed, as well as by the minor indentations. The E. coast is particularly well provided : Port Jackson is one of the finest natural harbours in the world ; Moreton Bay, more N., is yet larger, and has a less confined approach ; Botany Bay, 8 m. S. of Port Jackson, shoals towards the shore ; Port Stephens, Jervis Bay, and the two harbours of Twofold Bay, are good ; and tbe river-harbours of Port Macquarie at the mouth of the Hastings, and Port Hunter at the mouth of the Hunter, are accessible to vessels of moderate size. On the S. coast there are two good harbours within Port Phillip, viz : Geelong on the W. side, and Hobson's Bay at the head, where the Yarra- Yarra comes in ; the latter serv es as the harbour of Mel bourne, as only small vessels can go up the Yarra- Yarra to Melbourne itself: E. of Port Phillip there is a large enclosed sheet of water named Western Port: Portland Bay, in 142^\u00b0 E. long., is safe from all winds except the S.E., and is much frequented by whalers : in St. Vincent Gulf there are river-harbours at the mouths of the 'I orrens (Port Adelaide) and the Wakefield ; and in Spencer Gulf a fine harbour at Port Lincoln on the W. side, and accommodation at Port Augusta and Yatala at the head of the gulf, and at Germain on its E. side. At the S.W. angle of tlie continent there is a fine and well-situated harbour at King George Sound. On the W. coast Freemantle, at the mouth of the Swan Kiver, is the most frequented port, but the approach to it is somewhat dangerous. There are numerous good, but as yet unfrequented, harbours on the N.W. and N. coasts. Capes. \u2014 The most prominent capes are : \u2014 C. York, the extreme N. point of the continent ; C. Londonderry and C. Leveque, on the N.W. coast ; Vlaming Head or North-West C, at the point where the coast bends S. ; C. Leeuwin ( = Lioness, so named after the vessel which first Eighted it), at the S.W. angle ; and C. Howe, at the S.E. angle."], [639, "Chap. XXVIII. PHYSICAL FEATURES. 623 Islands. \u2014 Of the islands immediately adjacent to the shores of Australia we may notice : \u2014 Kangaroo I., at the entrance of the Gulf of St. Vincent, with harbourage in Nepean Bay, and a dry scrubby surface ; the Nuyts Archipelago, on the E. side of the Great Australian Bight ; the Recherche Archipelago, off the W. extremity of the Bight ; Dirk Hartog I., on the W. coast; Bathurst and Melville, off the N.W. coast, closing in the mouth of Van Diemen Gulf ; Groote Eylandt (the \"Great Island\") and Wellesley I., in the Gulf of Carpentaria; and Moreton and Stradbroke islands, on the E. side of Moreton Bay. \u00a7 3. Configuration of Surface \u2014 Mountains and Plains. \u2014 Australia appears to consist of a huge interior plain surrounded by a rim of high ground in all quarters except the N.W. between 16\u00b0 and 21\u00b0 S. lat.: it thus resembles Southern Africa more than any other part of the world. We know as yet so little of its interior that a complete description is impossible. The general direction oi the lines of elevation appears to be N. and S. : this is the case not only with the great eastern Cordillera and the corresponding range on the western coast, but with isolated ranges on the S. coast, such as the Flinders and Mount Lofty ranges. On tbe other hand, some portions of the eastern range are directed E. and W., as the Liverpool Range in 31\u00b0 40\" S. lat. Arnhem Land, in the N., is a table-land from 3000 to 4000 ft. high. But, whatever be the direction or character of the elevations, their position appears to be uniformly on the outer circle of the continent. Isolated peaks are of frequent occurrence. The ranges descend sharply towards the sea, and fall away gradually on the other side to the interior plains, forming iD this direction uplands of considerable extent, such as the Darling Downs, W. of Brisbane, and the Liverpool Plains, N. of the Liverpool Range. The interior appears to consist of a succession of plains ol varying character \u2014 sandy, stony, clayey, alluvial \u2014 sometimes wholly barren, elsewhere grassy and lightly timbered. Mountains. \u2014 The most important range with which we are acquainted is that which skirts the E. coast at an interval varying in breadth from 50 to 150 m. This range is known generally as the Eastern Cordillera, aud in different parts by the special names of the Blue Mts. in the neighbourhood of Sydney, and the Australian Alps in the S. E. angle of the continent. The latter form the loftiest portion of the whole range, attaiuing in Mt. Kosciusko a height of 6500 ft., and in Mounts Hptham and Latrobe about 7500 ft. It is remarkably rugged and im- practicable, and has its summits covered with snow for several months of the year. On the S. coast we may notice, in the western part of Victoria, the Pyrenees and the Grampians, which run N. and S. ; in South Australia, Flinders Range (about 40u0 ft.) and Mount Lofty Range (i412 ft.), running in parallel lines E. of Spencer Gulf, Stuart Range, N.W. of Lake Torrens, and the Gawler Ranges, between L. Gairdner and the sea ; in Western Australia, the Darling Range, which skirts the coast between Pt. d'Entrecasteaux and Shark Bay, culminat ing in Tulbanop, 5000 ft. Australia contains no active volcanoes, but traces of volcanic action are discernible in the conical hills in the"], [640, "624 AUSTRALIA, Book V Victoria range, and in Mt. Gambier and Mt. Schanck, near C. North umberland. \u00a7 4. Hydrography. \u2014 The peculiar conformation of Australia exercises a corresponding influence on its hydrography. The depres sion of its great interior basin, and its girdle of high land, are unfavourable to the production of large navigable rivers. The streams which rise on the interior slopes of the ranges no sooner reach the plains than they spread into lakes or meander in wide beds, and so either get absorbed by percolation and evaporation, or are converted during dry seasons into chains of water-holes, which are re-united during rainy periods, and then swell into floods of extraordinary volume. The rivers may be classified under three heads: \u2014 (1) Coast-rivers, which rise on the outer slopes of the ranges, and are generally of short course, but occasionally gain additional length by running parallel to the mountains. (2) The rivers of the interior basin, which are absorbed in the plains. (3) The rivers which rise in the interior basin, but reach the ocean through openings in the ranges. Rivers. \u2014 The Murray, which alone attains to anything like a con tinental importance, belongs to tbe last class ; it drains an area of 500,000 sq. m. in the S.E. of the continent ; it is composed of two great branches, the Murray, which rises near Mt. Kosciusko in 36\u00b0 30' S. lat., and the Barling, the head-waters of which extend probably as high as 25\u00b0, and include the Warrego, the Condamine, the Macintyre, the Peel, the Macquarie, and the Bogan. Between the Darling and the Murray there is an important branch of the latter, named the Lachlan, which also has a second fork, the Murrumbidgee, or \"beautiful\" river, so-called as flowing between verdant and bushy banks. The Murray and the Darling unite in 141\u00b0 38' E. long., and flow W. to 139\u00b0 45', where the stream turns sharply S. and reaches Encounter Bay, expanding just above its mouth into a broad lake named Victoria or Alexandrina. The Murray is navigable up to Albury, 378 m. from Sydney, and the Murrumbidgee to Gundagai, 240 m. from Sydney. Unfortunately the mouth of the Murray is shallow and dangerous : goods have consequently to be transported across the land from Goolwa to Victor Harbour, there to be reshipped for Adelaide. The Swan River is the chief stream on the west coast. The Victoria is of some value as opening a highway to the interior from the N.W. coast. On the N. coast the Adelaide and the Roper rise near each other in Arn hem Land. On the E. coast the Brisbane, which joins Moreton Bay, is navigable for 75 m. ; N. of this we may notice the Fitzroy and the Burdekin ; S. of it the Richmond, the Clarence, navigable for 60 m., the Hunter (in whose basin is a large coalfield), the Hawkesbury, which falls into Broken Bay N. of Sydney, and is navigable to Windsor, and the Shoalhaven. Lakes. \u2014 A large cluster of lakes occurs m South Australia, the chief being Lake Torrens, an elongated sheet about 1 20 m. long, and 20 m. distant from the head of Spencer Gulf ; L. Eyre, more N., of unknown extent ; and Lake Gairdner, W. of Lake Torrens. The cluster of lakes about Torrens conveyed to the first explorers, who were misled by the"], [641, "Chap. XXVIII. 625 CLIMATE. effects of mirage, the impression of a continuous crescent-shaped sheet of water, such as was depicted in our earlier maps. \u00a7 5. Climate. \u2014 The northern portion of Australia, to the extent of one-third of the whole, lies within the Tropics, and is subject to the usual conditions of an intertropical climate \u2014 periodical rains and a high temperature. The remainder of the continent is situated in the Temperate Zone, but its climate is much affected by the pecu liarities of its conformation. The rainfall is here irregular, or rather it may be said that dry and wet seasons are interchanged in cycles of years instead of cycles of months. Hence the extremes of withering droughts under which all vegetation languishes, and violent rains which inundate the interior plains and produce heavy floods in the rivers. During a dry summer the temperature of these plains is very high, and the blasts that emanate from them to the S. have quite a sirocco character. Sturt experienced a maximum heat of 131\u00b0 in the shade, and the effect of the sun's rays on the plains is such as to make the wind veer round in the direction of the sun as the day progresses. The climate of the coast regions is on the whole agreeable and healthy. Violent changes are indeed not uncommon in the S., particularly when the heated blasts of the interior are exchanged for the cold gales of the Antarctic Ocean : on these occasions the thermometer will suddenly experience a change of 40\u00b0, and even more, within a half hour. But in a general way Victoria and South Australia may be compared in respect to their climate with the Mediterranean portion of Italy, and Queensland with Madeira ; and the latter region, though hotter than the others, enjoys an immunity from the hot winds, in conse quence of the prevalence of the Trade-wind. On the mountains of New South Wales snow lies, but on the coast it is unknown. The mean annual temperature at Melbourne is 57\u00b0 \u25a0 6, at Sydney 65\u00b0 \u25a0 8, at Perth 63\u00b0, and at Brisbane 68\u00b0 \u25a0 7. The dryness of the climate leads to great disasters from bush fires, which occasionally rage'over large areas. The phenomenon of mirage is frequently produced in the heated atmosphere of South Australia. The rainfall at Sydney amounts to 58 inches, the bulk of which descends in the autumn months \u2014 March, April, and May: at Melbourne it is 32 inches, and as it generally descends violently, the number of wet days is few, as compared with England, though the rainfall is greater : at Brisbane, near the Tropic, it amounts to 55J inches. \u00a76. Vegetation.\u2014 The Flora of Australia, though exhibiting features of interest to the naturalist, is on the whole poor and uninviting. The foliage is remarkably scanty, many of the trees being wholly leafless, and its general hue is sombre and monoto nous. In the south-eastern regions the forests consist of various kinds of Eucalypti (gum-trees) and leafless acacias, together with MOD. GEO. \" E"], [642, "626 AUSTRALIA. Book V. heaths, ferns, and nettles of extraordinary growth. Many of the Eucalypti attain great size, and are serviceable for ship-building: this is particularly the case with the jarrah and the tovart of Western Australia. The south-western region abounds in Banksias, and plants with dry, everlasting blossoms. In the interior the prickly spinifex and the mallee, the golden wattle, and the shea-oak, are the usual forms. The northern regions have a more tropical vegetation, but are still deficient in the luxuriance that usually characterises the Torrid Zone. The Araucaria Cunninghamii is here common, and there are various species of palms, and the baobab or gouty-stem tree. There is a remarkable absence of bread-plants in the native Australian flora. The cabbage-palm, the sago-palm, the rock-melon, and a convolvulus root resembling a sweet potato, are the chief articles of food that have been discovered. Yet neither the soil nor the climate are at fault : both tropical and European plants \u2014 the sugar-cane, the coffee-plant, and indigo ; wheat, maize, and other cereals ; the vine, orange, lemon, peach, yam, mulberry, &c. \u2014 have all been readily naturalized there. \u00a7 7. Zoology. \u2014 The Fauna of Australia is even more scanty and unserviceable than its Flora : not a single ruminating or pachyder matous animal belongs to it; even the species of animals that are found there are few in number, and contain few individuals. Marsupial or pouched animals (such as the jumping kangaroo, the flying petaurus, the running bandicoot, the climbing plalanger, the burrowing wombat) form about 4-5ths of the mammals ; the pro vision for carrying their young, which forms their characteristic feature, adapts them to a country where water is scarce and has to be sought occasionally at a great distance. The \"dingo\" or native dog exists in a wild state, and is a most dangerous foe to the sheep fold. The ornithorhynchus is the greatest curiosity in the natural history of Australia : in its shape and fur it resembles an otter, but it has a duck's bill and webbed feet. The adjacent seas are tenanted by whales, dugongs or sea-cows, the turtle, the trepang or beche-de mer (on the N. coast), and various edible fish : the shark and sword fish attain a large size in these waters, and crocodiles are common in the northern rivers. Australia is famed for the number, the variety, and the beauty of its birds, particularly of the parrot tribe (parrots, cockatoos, parrakeets, &c.) : the emeu or cassowary, a large bird of the ostrich kind, frequents the plains of the interior. The British settlers have introduced not only the horse, the ox, and the sheep, but their favourite songsters, bees, and even salmon and trout. \u00a7 8. Minerals. \u2014 The mineral wealth of Australia has attracted great attention since 1851, when gold was first discovered there. The most extensive gold-field is in Victoria \u2014 N.W. of Melbourne,"], [643, "Chap. XXVIII. ZOOLOGY \u2014MINERALS \u2014INHABITANTS.- 627 about Ballarat, Castlemaine (Mount Alexander), and Sandhurst\u2014 and N.E. of Melbourne near the New South Wales frontier at Ovens and other places. In New South Wales, gold-mines are at work at Summerbill Creek near the river Macquarrie in Boxburgh, and in the Maruya basin in the S. In South Australia gold has been discovered at Echunda, 23 m. from Adelaide, and at South Park near Gawler; and in Queensland, at Rockhampton on the Fitzroy. South Australia possesses copper-mines of great richness at Burra-Burra, Kapunda (50 m. N.E. of Adelaide), Wallaroo and Kadina on York Peninsula, and other places. In West Australia there are rich deposits of the same metal near Champion Bay; lead is also found here and in South Australia. A large coal-field exists in the basin of the Hunter Eiver in New South Wales, and already yields a considerable amount: fields have also been disco vered about Lake Illawarra in New South Wales, 34\u00b0 30' S. lat., in Western Australia, and in Queensland. Salt is obtained from salt lakes and marshes, which are not uncommon; Korangamyte Lake, about 60 m. W. of Geelong, furnishes the largest supply. \u00a7 9. Inhabitants. \u2014The native population belongs to the Aus tral-Negro division of the human race, and is allied to, but decidedly differs from the Papua, which is found throughout the Melanesian islands: it probably reached Australia from Timor. Black curly hair, a dark coppery skin, bushy overhanging eyebrows, high cheek bones, and a broad flattened nose, are the characteristic features of the native Australians. Their clothing is extremely slight, consist ing of an opossum or kangaroo skin, or a grass mat; and even these are not unfrequently dispensed with. The same may be said of their dwellings. Their weapons are the spear and the \" boomerang,\" which they handle with wonderful skill. Their normal condition is one of great poverty and wretchedness: the absence of bread-plants and of domesticated animals compels them to gain a very preca rious subsistence from fish, eggs, lizards, grubs, roots (particularly of the bulrush), and the small produce of the chase. It has been estimated that an area of 50 sq. m. is on the average required for the subsistence of a single native, and consequently that the sum total of the native population cannot exceed 60,000, and probably falls short of that number by 7000, there being in New South Wales only 1700, in Victoria 1900, in South Australia 5046, and in Queensland 15,000. The race seems doomed to speedy extinction. The immigrant population is mainly British : about 35,000 Chinese are living in Victoria and New South Wales, chiefly at the gold diggings; and Germans have established themselves in most of the colonies. The population has trebled itself since the discovery ofthe gold mines in 1851, and is still advancing with rapid strides. The continent is divided into 6 portions, of which 5 are organized 2 e 2"], [644, "Book V. 628 AUSTRALIA. colonies, and the remaining one (North Australia) a territory. The position of these divisions is implied in some cases by their titles. The exceptions are New South Wales, on the E. coast between C. Howe and Point Danger; Victoria, on the S. coast between C. Howe and 141\u00b0 E. long. ; and Queensland, on the E. coast to the N. of Point Danger. The areas and populations of these divisions are as follows : \u2014 Government, Religion, and Education. \u2014 The political institutions of the Australian colonies are all framed on the same model. The executive power is vested in a Governor appointed by the Sovereign, and aided in his duties by an Executive Council, consisting of re sponsible ministers and others. The Legislative power is exercised by a Parliament of two bouses \u2014 the upper house being designated the Legislative Council, and the lower one the House of Assembly. Western Australia alone dispenses with the latter body. There is no established form of religion : the Anglican Church is organised under 8 bishops, whose sees are at Sydney, Newcastle, Goulburn, Grafton (\"these 4 in New South Wales), Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, and Bris bane : the Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Wesleyan, and other Pro testant bodies, are also duly represented. Elementary education is aided by grants from the State ; and there are Universities at Sydney and Melbourne, the former having the privilege of granting degrees of the same rank as those of the English Universities. Agriculture, Mining, and Commerce. \u2014 The agricultural resources of Australia are in course of rapid development. Pastoral pursuits hold tbe first place : many portions of Australia are admirably adapted to sheep-feeding, particularly the upland plains at the back ofthe coast ranges, which are clear of wood and thus ready-made for the settler. In Queensland the pastoral stations already extend over 195,000 sq. m., aud include the Darling and Fitzroy Downs, the Waterloo and Calvert Plains, and other favoured localities. Wheat forms the staple product of agriculture throughout the continent : to this, Queensland adds various tropical plants, such as the sugar-cane, indigo, arrowroot, coffee, rice, maize, and tobacco, which last three are also produced in New South Wales. Much of the soil of Queensland and New South Wales is adapted to cotton. The vine is cultivated in Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales. Mining gives employment to about 66,000 bands in Victoria. Foreign commerce is carried on chiefly with Great Britain : the exports are gold, wool, tallow, hides, and copper, and the imports, manufactured goods of all kinds, tea (from China), spirits, beer, &c. A considerable amount of commerce is also earned on between the colonies themselves. Towns. \u2014 The towns of Australia are laid out with broad and regular New South Wales . . Victoria Queensland .

TASMANIA. 629 streets ; but being of modern origin they present little of interest. Sydney (with its suburbs, 93,686) is the oldest (founded in 1788), and up to 1851 was the largest town in Australia : it is beautifully situated on the S. shore of Port Jackson, is well defended, and hos a consider able number of public buildings, which give it a handsome appearance : it is the capital of New South Wales. The other towns in that colony are Parramatta (5577), on a river of the same name, navigable up to this point, and falling into Port Jackson ; Maitland (7528), on the Hunter river ; Bathurst (4042), on the Macquarie, near the gold-mines; Newcastle, at the mouth of the Hunter river, a coal-shipping port ; and Windsor, on the Hawkesbury. Melbourne (125,000), the capital of Victoria, is the most populous place in Australia ; it stands on the Yarra- Yarra, 2 m. from Hobson's Bay, where it has a port named Williamstown : it was founded in 1837, and is a busy but unattractive place. The other towns in Victoria are Geelong (22,986), on the W. side of Port Phillip, 40 m. S.W. of Melbourne, with a good harbour, and surrounded by a fertile district ; and the mining towns of Ballarat and Castlemaine, N.W. of Melbourne. Adelaide (17,933) is the capital and only important town of South Australia, with a port of the same name on an inlet of St. Vincent Gulf, 8 m. distant ; it stands on the banks of the river Torrens, and on the plain intervening between the gulf and Mount Lofty range. In Western Australia, Perth, on the Swan River, 10 m. from its mouth, is the capital, and Freemantle, at the river's mouth, the chief port. In Queensland, Brisbane (4225), on the river of the same name, about 25 m. from the sea, is the capital. \u00a7 10. Tasmania. \u2014 Tasmania or Van Diemen\"s Land (the first being its present official designation after its discoverer Tasman, and the second the name assigned to it by Tasman, in honour of the then governor of Dutch India) lies off the S.E. angle of Australia, between 41\u00b0 20' and 43\u00b0 40' S. lat., 144\u00b0 40\" and 148\u00b0 W E. long. It is of triangular shape, the base-line abutting on Bass Strait, and the apex pointing S. ; it has a length of about 180 m. from N. to S. and a breadth very nearly as great ; an area of 26,215 sq. m. ; and a popu lation of 89,977. Coast-line, Mountains, &c. \u2014 The coasts of Tasmania are much in- dented, and are provided with a superabundance of excellent harbour- age. In the S.E., particularly, there are numerous land-locked bays on the shores of Tasman's Peninsula, Ralph's Peninsula, and Bruny Island : Storm Bay, which lies between these, leads up to the estuary ofthe Derwent, which supplies Hobarton with one ofthe finest harbours in the world. On the E. eoast Oyster Bay is enclosed seaward by Freyeinet's Peninsula and Schouten Island : more N. there are harbours at St. Helen's Port and the Bay of Fires. The W. coast is generally steep and inaccessible, but has fine openings at Port Bavey and Mac- quarie Harbour. On the N. coast the best harbourage is found at the mouths ofthe Mersey 'Port Frederick; and the Tamar(Port Dalrymple), which last is navigable to Launceston. The most prominent capes are C. Grim, at the N.W. angle ; South Cape ; C. FiUar, on Tasman's Peninsula; and C. Portland, at the N.E. angle. The surface of Tas- mania is generally rugged ; the central region is occupied by a pla teau about 3000 ft. high, and bestrewed with lakes, whence emanate the feeders of the Derwent. A detached series of chains traverses the"], [646, "630 NEW ZEALAND. Book V. N.E. angle of the island, with the culminating heights of Ben-Nevis (3910 ft.) and Ben-Lomond (5002 ft.). A similar mass projects into the N.W. angle, consisting of a central knot called the Surrey Hills, aud two long arms, known as Campbell's Range and Eldon Range. At the S.AV. angle of the plateau is found Mount Humboldt (5520 ft.), the highest point on the island, and from this a range projects E. to near Hobart Town, terminating in the fine basaltic summit of Mount Wellington (4166 ft.). The chief rivers are the Derwent, which rises on the plateau in Lake St. Clair, and flows S.E. to Storm Bay ; and the Tamar, which is composed of the North Esk and South Esk, with their numerous branches. The climate is variable, but on the whole healthy, and not unfavourable to agricultural operations. Rain is sufficiently abundant, the average fall being about 21 inches. The temperature averages 53\u00b0, occasionally rising to an excessive height under the influence of hot-blasts from the nortb, but seldom sinking below 25\u00b0. Summer frosts are the chief drawback to the vegetation, and these prevail in the valleys rather than on the high grounds. The native vegetation resembles that of Australia ; a large part of the island is covered with fine forests of blue-gum, Huon pine, and various cabinet woods \u2014 cedar, myrtle, musk-wood, aud sassafras. The Euro pean cereals do well in the valleys of the Tamar and the Derwent ; and the uplands are adapted to sheep-feeding. Wool forms the chief export: wheat, timber, oil, and bark (for tanning), are secondary articles of export. The animals resemble those of Australia, the most noticeable feature being the existence of two very fierce marsupials, called the tiger-hy\u00e6na (Thylacinus s and the native devil (Sarcophilus). Gold and other minerals, including coal in abundance, exist on the island, but the superior attractions of Austraha have checked all mining operations in Tasmania. The aborigines are almost, if not quite, extinct : only one male was alive in 1864 : they resembled the Papuan of New Caledonia rather than the Australian, in that they had the frizzly shock of hair. The immigrant population is almost wholly British. For 50 years preceding 1853, a penal settlement was main tained there, and the colony has benefited by the public works con structed by the convicts. It became an independent colony in 1819, with political institutions of the same character as the Australian colonies. The chief towns are Hobart Town or Hobarton (19,449), the capital, situated on the Derwent about 20 m. above its mouth ; and Launceston (10,359), at the head of the estuary of the Tamar, the most handy port for communication with Australia ; an excellent high road connects these two towns. The Furneaux Isles, off the N.E. angle, are a numerous group, of which Flinders is the chief. \u00a7 11. New Zealand : its Position, Area, and Population \u2014 History. \u2014 New Zealand is the collective name of a group of islands lying S.E. of Australia (from which it is distant about 1250 m.) between 34\u00b0 25' and 47\u00b0 20' S. lat., and 166\u00b0 and 178\u00b0 35' E. long. The group consists of two large islands, a third considerably smaller but of appreciable size, and a multitude of islets. The three larger form a line of about 1100 m. in length, and the names usually current for them \u2014 North, Middle, and South Islands \u2014 have reference to their position in this line, their official designations being respectively New Ulster, New Munster, and New Leinster or Stewart Isle. The"], [647, "Chap. XXVIII. POSITION, NATURAL FEATURES, ETC. 631 Middle Isle is separated from its northern neighbour by Cook Strait, and from South Island by Foveaux Strait. The aggregate area of the islands is estimated at 106,259 sq. m., and its population at 171,931, exclusive of the Maoris and the military force. History.\u2014 The discovery of New Zealand is generally attributed to Tasman, who visited it in 1642, and named it the \" States-Island.\" It seems probable, however, that it had been visited by European navigators m the 16th cent. The name New Zealand (Nova Zelandia) appears as early as 1666. Little was known of these islands until the time of Cook's repeated visits to their shores between 1769 and 1777 ; nor indeed was Stewart Island discovered until 1808. The coasts of New Zealand were frequented by English whaling-ships towards the close of last century, and a few sailors and others settled there ; but no organized system of colonization took place until 1839, when the New Zealand Company was formed. In 1840 New Zealand was con stituted a separate colony, and since that time its history is one of un interrupted progress. \u00a7 12. Natural Features\u2014 Coast-line, Mountains, and Ei- vers.\u2014 The three islands of New Zealand present marked contrasts in their outlines and surfaces. North Island is of very irregular shape, somewhat resembling a low boot viewed upside down, the heel being at East Cape and the toe at Cape Maria Van Diemen. Middle 'Island is of an oblong shape strongly indented at its N. and S. extremities, but generally regular on its long sides. Stewart Island is triangular, the base abutting on Foveaux Channel and the apex pointing S. The dorsal line of elevation which runs through these islands approximates more generally to the W. than to the E. coast. This tendency is especially marked in the southern half of Middle Island, where the mountains, known as the Southern Alps, run parallel to the coast between 43\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 S. lat. : it is also ap- parent in the central and southern parts of North Island, in which the long range, known by the various names of Rangitoto, where it bounds the basin of the Waikato, Rua-Hine in 40\u00b0 S. lat., and Tara-Rua in the southern peninsula, is decidedly nearer the W. than the E. coast. E. of this line an elevated plateau is found in both islands, that of Middle Island containing numerous lakes. A volcanic belt crosses North Island diagonally between the Bay of Plenty on the E. coast and C. Egmont on the W., its line being marked by the volcanic isle of Puhia-i-Wakati in the Bay of Plenty, the snow-clad cone of Mount Edgecombe (9630 ft.), which rises out of a plain near the E. coast, the still active cone of Tongariro (6200 ft.) and the dormant one of Ruapelin or Ruapehu (9195 ft.) in the central region, and the fine cone of Mount Egmont (8838 ft.) in the W., which answers to Mount Edgecombe in position and appearance. These form the cul minating heights of North Island ; but they are surpassed by Mount Cook (13,200 ft.) in the Southern Alps, and are about equalled by"], [648, "632 NEW ZEALAND. Book V. Mount Kaikora (9300 ft.) in the N.E. angle, and possibly by Mount Arthur in the N.W. angle of the Middle Island. In Stewart Island the loftiest summit, Mount Anglem, does not much exceed 3000 ft. The rivers are necessarily of short course : the most important are in North Island, where the Waikato and the Wanganui gain extra length by their longitudinal direction : the Waikato issues from Lake Taupo, at an elevation of 1337 ft., and is navigable for small craft for about 100 m. : both the above rivers seek the W. coast. Coast-line. \u2014 In North Island the coasts are directed N.E. between North Cape and East Cape; S.E., between East Cape and C. Palliser at the S. extremity of the island ; S., between C. Palliser and C. Sin clair; S.W., hence to C. Egmont; W., between C. Egmont and C. Maria Van Diemen ; and N., for the small stretch between this and North Cape. The N.E. coast is strongly indented, and abounds with fine harbours: the chief openings are the Gulf of Hauraki, which pene trates deeply inland, and the more open Bay of Plenty. Harbourage is found at the following points on the N.E. coast : \u2014 Wangaroa, a fine basin, with an entrance only 450 ft. broad ; the Bay of Islands ; Wan garuru; and Waitemata, in the Gulf of Hauraki. The opposite or N.W. coast is more regular, and the inlets are frequently encumbered with bars ; the most important are the two which approximate so closely to the Gulf of Hauraki near Auckland, viz., Manukao, 15 m. long and 10 broad, with a narrow neck, and Kaipara, somewhat more N., which elongates N. and S., receiving the Wairoa in the former and the Kaipara in the latter direction. Jlore to the S. there are open ings at the estuary of the Waikato, Wangaroa Harbour, and Kawhia Harbour. The S.W. coast is regular, the only opening being at the estuary of the Wanganui, which is accessible to vessels of 200 tons.' The S.E. coast is also regular, and generally high and rocky; the in ward sweep of Hawke Bay is its chief feature. The S. eoast is divided by projecting points into two bays, the westerly one being Port Nichol son, a land-locked and spacious basin with a narrow neck, and the easterly one Palliser Bay, which is open and exposed. In Middle Island the coasts are more regular than in North Island, and the inlets fewer. The N. coast presents the chief exception to this description ; it is bifurcated by the deep intrusion of Blind or Tasman Bay, and the eastern projection or peninsula is further fretted with inlets, among which Admiralty Bay, a long fiord penetrating 30 m. between lofty forest-clad cliffs, and Queen Charlotte Sound, less tor tuous, and with a good harbour at Ship Cove, may be especially noticed. W. of Tasman Bay is Massacre Bay, protected on the N. by a long sand-spit projecting from C. Farewell ; and E. of Queen Charlotte Sound is Cloudy Bay, with harbourage at Port Underwood. The S.E. coast is varied by the rounded protuberance called Banks Peninsula, with two good harbours in the angle between it aud the mainland on the N. side, distinguished as Victoria (on which Lyttleton is situated) and Albert ; and a single harbour, named Akaroa, on its S. side. Port Otago is the only important inlet on this coast ; it is sheltered, but has a bar at its mouth. At the S.W. angle fiords again recur, and offer safe harbourage at Dusky Bay, Chalky Bay, and Preservation Harbour. The W. coast is regular and rock-bound, and, with the exception of Milford Haven, in 44\u00b0 30' S. lat., the inlets are exposed to the swell of the ocean. Port Pegasus is the chief harbour on Stewart Isle."], [649, "Chap. XXVIII. CLIMATE, INHABITANTS, ETC. 633 \u00a713. Climate and Productions.\u2014 The climate of New Zealand is most decidedly Oceanic\u2014 mild, moist, and equable. The mean annual temperature of North Island is 57\u00b0, and of Middle Island 52\u00b0, thus exceeding that of England by 7\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 respectively. But the range of the thermometer is much less in New Zealand than here, and the winters rather resemble those of the South of France or Italy. Bain is very persistent and occasionally very heavy: the average fall amounts to about 50 inches in North Island and 32 in Middle Island: the damp does not, however, appear to be prejudicial to health. The winds are strong and generally in action. The flora of New Zealand partakes of the Australian character, but is more luxuriant. Timber is abundant and of excellent and varied quality : the Kauri pine, which grows N. of 38\u00b0, is a remarkably fine tree. Tree-ferns are common. Bread-plants are scarce here, as in Aus- tralia: the chief edible products are the roots of a species of fern (pteris esculenta), of the taro, and of the convolvulus batata, and the leaves and heart of a palni (areca sapida). The most valuable com- mercial product indigenous to the island is the phormium tenax, which serves as a substitute for flax. European plants of all kinds have been introduced with success. The fauna of New Zealand is charac- terized by the same absence of useful quadrupeds as the Australian : the birds are peculiar : the apteryx, resembling the ostrich in having flappers instead of wings, is the only surviving (and now rare) member of a large class of birds which once existed on these islands, end of which the remains of the dinornis and pal\u00e6pteryx are fre- quently found. Minerals are abundant : gold has been already dis- covered in various localities : \u2014 in Middle Island, on the W. coast about the Hokotiki and Teramakau rivers in the province of Canterbury, and on the E . coast near Picton in the N. and Otago in the S. ; and in North Island in Auckland province. Coal is abundant. Copper and manganese have also been found. \u00a7 14. Inhabitants \u2014 Political Divisions \u2014 Towns. \u2014 The native ppulation of New Zealand is a branch of the Malay stock, which migrated hither at no very distant period (it is supposed about 500 years back) from an island in the N.E. named, according to their traditions, Hawaiki (perhaps Savvaii in the Navigator group). The Maories, as they are named, are a fine intelligent race, apt at acquir- ing the arts both of peace and war, and susceptible of the elevating influences of Christianity. Unfortunately disputes with the settlers have been of periodical recurrence, and it seems almost impossible for the two races permanently to live together. In 1861 the number of the natives amounted to 55,276, of whom 53,056 were in North Island, and the small remainder in Middle Island. The immigrant population is almost wholly British, and has rapidly increased since the discovery of gold. 2 e 3"], [650, "634 NEW ZEALAND. Book V, Native Village, New Zealand. Political Divisions, &c. \u2014 New Zealand is divided into 9 provinces : \u2014 Auckland, Tarauaki, Wellington, and Hawkes Bay, in North Island ; Nelson, Marlborough, Canterbury, Otago, and Southland, in Middle Island, the last including also Stewart Island. Each province has a Council for the management of its local affairs, their common and general interests being directed by a Governor appointed by the Sove- reign, .a Legislative Council, and a House of Representatives. Agri- cultural pursuits, especially sheep-feeding, are the leading occupation in the colony : mining has of late attracted numerous adventurers from Australia. The exports, in the order of their value, are gold, wool, kauri gum, timber, hides, and grain: the imports, colonial produce, tea, clothing, and cutlery. The towns call for little notice : Auckland (7989), the capital ofthe whole colony as well as of its own province, stands on the W. side of Hauraki Gulf, with Mamikao for a second harbour on the opposite coast of the island : the other provincial capitals in North Island are New Plymouth (3U00), Taranaki, on the coast just N. of Mt. Egmont ; Napier, Hawke Bay, on the S. side of the bay so named ; and Wellington, on Port Nicholson, in the southmost pro- vince. In Middle Island, Nelson, at the head of Blind Bay ; Picton, Marlborough province, on the S. side of Queen Charlotte Sound ; Christohuroh (5000), Canterbury, N.W. of Banks Peninsula, with Lyttelton for its harbour ; Dunedin (4000), Otago, at the head of Port Otago ; and Invercargill (2000), Southland, at the mouth of New Ross River, with a port in Bluff Harbour. The Auckland, Chatham, and Norfolk Isles. \u2014 The Auckland Isles are situated 180 m. S. of New Zealand, in 50\u00b0 56' S. lat., 166\u00b0 7' E. long., and consist of several finely-wooded and fertile islands, of which Auck land is the chief, occupied since 1840 by about 70 Maories. Campbell Isle lies S.E. and Macquarie Isle S.W. of Auckland. The Chatham Isles"], [651, "Chap. XXVIII. MELANESIA. 635 lie about 350 m. E. of New Zealand, and consist of Chatham, Pitt, and other lesser islands, moderately elevated and undulating, occupied by a mixed population of about 200 black aborigines aud 400 Maories, the remnant of a much larger body who invaded these isles in 1830. The above groups are visited by whaling-ships for shelter and pro visions, each having a good harbour. The Kermadeo Isles lie N.E. of New Zealand, a group of 4, rocky and uninhabited. Norfolk Island is the chief member of a group of 3, situated in 29\u00b0 S. lat., 168\u00b0 10' E. long., about 475 m. N.W. of New Zealand, and under the governor of New South Wales. Norfolk Isle has an area of 13i sq. m., and a population of 268, consisting mainly of the Pitcairn islanders who, to the number of 194, were transplanted hither in 1 856 ; some have since returned to Pitcairn. The island is beautiful and fertile, the original home of the Araucaria excelsa or Norfolk Island pine, and other valuable trees. II. \u2014 Melanesia. \u00a7 15. Melanesia. \u2014 Melanesia comprises the zone of islands which encircles Australia on the N. and E., commencing with New Guinea, and running through the groups of Solomon, Santa Cruz, and the New Hebrides to New Caledonia in the S., and the Feejee or Viti Islands in the E. These islands are grouped together on an ethnological principle, as being all occupied by a race distinct from that which is found in the more easterly islands of the Pacific, viz. : by the Papuas, a people of a blackish-brown complexion, with black bushy crisp \" mops\" of hair (to which they owe their designation of Papua rnop headed), thick lips, and slight lank bodies. The aggregate area of the Melanesian isles is estimated at 327,700 sq. m., and its popu lation (for which the data are very imperfect) at 2,200,000. The amounts for the chief islands and groups are as follows : \u2014 History of Discovery, &c. \u2014 New Guinea was first discovered by the Por tuguese about 1520, but its full outline was not known until the latter part of the last century, and the interior is even now a terra incognita. The Dutch have endeavoured to establish themselves on the shores of Geelvink Bay, but with what success is not known ; they appear, how ever, to exercise a supremacy over the Arroo Islands, which lie off the W. coast and where the population is partly Christianized. New Britain was so named by Dampier, who in 1700 navigated the strait which separates it from New Guinea, of which it was formerly thought to be a part New Ireland was similarly discovered to be separated Group.

Book V. from New Britain by Carteret, who in 1767 navigated George Channel, and gave name to the island. The Solomon or Salomon group was discovered by the Spaniard Mendaua in 1567, and so named (it is said) from his idea of its great wealth. The discovery of the Santa Cruz group was also effected by Mendana in 1595 : on one of these islands the French navigator La Pe'rouse was wrecked in 1788, and his fate was unknown until 1827. The New Hebrides were so named by Cobk in 1774, having been previously visited by Quiros in 1595, who thought that he had discovered in the island of Espiritu Santo the continent of Terra Australis : the zealous missionary Williams was murdered on Erromango in this group, in 1839. New Caledonia was discovered and named by Cook in 1774 : in 1853 the French took possession of this and the adjacent islands, and have introduced ecclesiastical and naval establishments there. The Feejee islands, though sighted by Tasman in 1643, were not explored until 1827 : a considerable colony of British and North-Americans is established on this group, chiefly on Ovalau, a small island with a good port. Natural Features, Climate, and Productions. \u2014 The Melanesian isles appear to belong to a single mountain-system, with the exception of the outlying group of the Feejees. The general line of elevation preserves a noteworthy degree of parallelism to the outline of the N.E. coast of Australia. New Guinea may be regarded as the basis or central knot of the system. A lofty range of snowy mountains has been observed in the west-central part of that island : its course has not been traced throughout, but we may suppose it to be continued to the E. central part, and there to bifurcate into the Owen Stanley Range, which pro ceeds S.E. and is continued in the Louisiade Archipelago, and the Finisterre Mts. which proceed E. and are resumed in New Britain, the connecting link with the more easterly chain of islands. The chief links in this chain are New Ireland; the Solomon Group, of which the islands in the direct line are Bougainville, Choisenl, Isabel, and Malayta, while a second or parallel range appears in the S. composed of New Georgia, Guadalcanal, and San Christoval ; the Santa Cruz islands ; the New Hebrides, of which Espiritu Santo is the largest, and to which Banks Islands may be considered to belong, though they are occasion ally treated as an independent group ; and New Caledonia, 200 m. long, traversed by a dorsal range throughout its whole extent, with the Loyalty Islands forming a parallel line more to the E. Volcanic agency is observable throughout the whole chain, but most prominently in the eastern section of it, from the southern portion of the Solomon group, where there are active volcanoes on Guadalcanal and Sesarga. to Matthews Rock, S.E. of New Caledonia, between which points the active volcanoes of Tinakoro in the Santa Cruz group, and Ambrym and Tanna in the New Hebrides, are connecting links. Good harbours are found in each of the groups ; the W. coasts of New Caledonia are dangerous from the barrier-reefs and islands about them. The Feejee or, more properly, Viti islands, a group of about 180, mostly of vol- canic origin, are compactly situated between 15r\u00b0 and 20^\u00b0 S. lat., 177\u00b0 E., and 178\u00b0 W. long. : the largest, named Viti-Levu, has an area of about 4500 sq. m. Climate and Productions. \u2014 The climate of Melanesia is tropical ; but the heat is moderated on all tbe islands, except the interior of New Guinea, by the sea-breezes which sweep across them. The most notice able feature in the climate is the difference of rainfall on the two sides of those mountain-ranges which cross the path of the Trade-wind :"], [653, "Chap. XXVIII. 637 POLYNESIA. while the exposed side has an abundance of rain, with a proportionate degree of verdure, the other remains dry and bare. The natural productions of these islands are not yet fully known : the vegetation is most luxuriant and the mountain-sides are clothed with fine forests of timber ; bread-plants are plentiful, among them the yam, the sago, the bread-fruit, the cocoa-nut, and the plantain. Gold and other minerals are known to exist in New Guinea, and coal has been discovered in New Caledonia. The fauna is conspicuous for the absence of the more valuable animals, such as the cow and the horse ; the bird of Paradise is a native of New Guinea. The beche-de-mer (exported to China), tortoise-shell, and pearl-shell, are the chief articles of commercial value. The English settlers have introduced the sugar-cane, cotton and tobacco into the Feejee group, and the French have done the same in New Caledonia. Inhabitants. \u2014 The native population of Melanesia is roughly estimated at 2J millions. The Papuas (as they are called) are about the most ferocious barbarians with whom Europeans have come into contact ; they are nevertheless yielding to the humanizing influences of Christi anity under tbe exertions of various religious bodies, which are at work in this field \u2014 the Roman Catholics in New Caledonia, the Independents in the Loyalty islands, particularly Lifu which is wholly Christian, the Presbyterians on the southern New Hebrides, and the Anglican Church in the more northerly islands.

Divisions \u2014 Groups\u2014 History or Discovery. \u2014 Under the general head of Polynesia we include the whole of the islands lying outside the belt formed by Melanesia. The majority of these are clustered thickly together in a broad belt which preserves a certain amount of parallelism to the one already described, having the same general tendency from N.W. to S.E. Outside this belt again lie the"], [654, "Book V. 638 POLYNESIA.

To classify the island groups in any satisfactory manner is almost impossible : we shall divide the main belt into two parts \u2014 a North-Western and a South-Eastern \u2014 placing the limit between them in about 10\u00b0 S. lat., and 180\u00b0 long., and reserving the Sandwich group and the Sporades for a separate and third division. (1.) The North-Western division coincides with the Micronesia of the French geographers, the distinguishing feature of which is the diminutive size of the islands. It comprises (from N.W. to S.E.) the Pelew, Mariana or Ladrone, Caroline, Marshall, Gilbert, and Ellice groups. (2.) The South-Eastern division comprises (from W. to E.) the Navigator or Samoa, Friendly or Tonga, Cook or Hervey, Society, Tubuai, Paumota or Low, and Marquesas groups. (3.) The remaining division comjirises the Sandwich group, va rious isolated islands W. and N.W. of the group, which are classed together as forming the Magellan or Anson Archipelago, to the ex clusion occasionally of the Bonin or Arrobispo volcanic group in the extreme W. near the Loo-Choo Islands ; and lastly, in the very opposite direction, the remote Easter I., and Sala-y-Gomez I. The aggregate area of these groups is about 18,000 sq. m., and the estimated population (for which the data are uncertain) about 300,000.

The Caroline group was discovered by the Spaniard Lazeano in 1686, and was named after his sovereign Charles II. The Marshall and Gilbert groups are named after the English navigators who surveyed them in 1788, the former having been previously visited by Saavedra in 1529 and other subsequent explorers. The Navigator Islands were so named by the Frenchman Bougainville in 1768, in consequence (it is supposed; of the nautical skill of the natives. The Tonga isles were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Cook in 1773 and 1777, who named them the Friendly Islands in consequence of the amiability of the natives. The Society Islands were discovered by Quiros in 1606, and received their name from Cook in honour of the Royal Society, by whom he was sent out in 1769 to observe the transit of Venus; in 1842 France\" established a protectorate (in reality a sovereignty) over Tahiti, the largest of the group. The Gambier group in the Low Archipelago also acknowledges a French protectorate. The outlying island of Pitcairn, discovered by Carteret in 1767, became the asylum of the mutineers of the ' Bounty ' in 1789, where they remained, unknown to the English authorities, until 1825 ; having outgrown their means of subsistence on Pitcairn, they were transplanted in 1856 to Norfolk Isle, but some of them have since returned to their old home. The Marquesas Islands were so named by their discoverer Mendana iu 1595 in honour of the Marquis of Mendoza, the Spanish governor of Peru ; France established a pro- tectorate over them in 1842, and maintains a garrison at Taiohae, on Nukahiva. The Sandwich islands were discovered in 1778 by Cook, who met his end in an engagement with the natives on Hawaii in 1779. From the year 1786 down to the present day there has been a large aud increasing intercourse between this group and Great Britain, and the European system of government has been successfully introduced. \u00a7 17. Natural Features \u2014 Climate and Productions. \u2014 Though the islands of Polynesia appear at first sight to be thrown broadcast without order over the surface of the Ocean, a closer inspection will show principles of unity and arrangement in the grouping. The general direction of the zone has been already indicated : this accords with the general direction of the individual groups, the majority of which (4-5ths of the whole) run N.W. and S.E. The islands present the strongest differences in appearance and formation, some groups being of coralline structure, others volcanic, and some having a com- mixture of both formations ; but the coralline are supposed to rest on volcanic bases, and are evidently the result of a gradual sub sidence, inasmuch as the coral insect cannot exist at a lower depth than about 200 ft. ; the rounded forms of the lagoon islands favour the supposition that they have been built round a mountain-summit,"], [656, "640 POLYNESIA. Book V. or on the edge of a crater. Thus Polynesia may overlie a submerged continent, in which great variations of level have been produced by elevation and subsidence. The proportionate number of volcanic and coralline islands is 350 of the former to 290 of the latter (islets omitted) throughout the whole of the Pacific. The difference in the aspect of these islands is very marked : the volcanic are high and precipitous, their valleys and plains clothed generally with a luxu riant foliage : the coralline are low, from 6 to 12 ft. above the level of the sea, and with a thin belt of cocoa-nut palm or pandanus. The volcanic are frequently surrounded by an encircling reef, within which is a belt of still water accessible through openings in the reef : but such reefs are never found where volcanic force is in action, those spots being studiously avoided by the coral insect. In the groups above enumerated, the most remarkable ofthe coralline groups are the Paumota or Low Archipelago in the S.E., consisting of 80 atolls; and the Caroline Archipelago, consisting of 60 groups of atolls, with about 500 islands, extending over 1000 m. Many of the smaller groups \u2014 the Pelew, the Marshall, the Gilbert, and the Tubuai\u2014 are of similar structure, together with the southern Marianas. Whitsunday Island, of which a view is prefixed to this section, is a member of the Low Archipelago. Tahiti furnishes a good specimen of an encircling reef, the island rising, like a fortress out of a moat, to the height of 7000 ft., and surrounded by a still channel, varying in width frum half a mile to 3 miles, and 200 ft. deep. Active volcanoes are not numerous in Polynesia; the most remarkable is Mouna Roa or Loa (13,758 ft.) on Hawaii, the chief of the Sandwich islands, with a huge solid summit- crater out of which rise small eruptive cones, and a secondary crater or lava-lake, named Kilauea, at a lower level (3783 ft.). Mouna Hualalai (7822 ft.) on tbe same island, has also broken out within the present century ; while Mouna Kea (13,951 ft.), the third summit which makes up this extraordinary island, is dormant. There are active volcanoes on Tafoa and Amargura in the Tonga group, and Guguan, Pagon and Asuncion in the Mariana group. Amid the coralline groups a few islands of a different character are interspersed \u2014 high and verdant ; as in the Caroline group, Yap, Punipet or Ascension, and Ualau or Walau ; in the Tonga group, Lato. Amargura, Tofoa, and Kao ; in the Cook group, Rarotonga ; and in the Low Archipelago, Matia. on the W. verge, and 5 of the Gambier isles in the S.E. part of the group, together with the outlying island of Pitcairn. Finally, the islands in the N. of the Mariana group, and those of the Navigator, Society, Tubuai, Marquesas, and Sandwich groups, are eutirely high and volcanic in their origin ; and this is the case with the remote Easter I. and Sala-y-Gomez. The climate of Polynesia is delightful\u2014 a perpetual summer ; the vegetable products are about the same as in Melanesia\u2014 the bread-fruit tree, cocoa- nut palm, pandanus, taro, batata, yam, and banana. 1 he taro-root is consumed in the form of a paste, called ' poe ' by the Sandwich islanders. The paper-mulberry-tree of the Society Islands is of great value, sup- plying the material for making cloth and paper. Quadrupeds are ex tremely rare ; the pig (which may have been casually introduced ), the dog (used as an article of food), and the rat (ubiquitous in these islands), are the chief ones. On the other hand, the islands enjoy an immunity from serpents, venomous insects, and other plagues of intertropical regions."], [657, "Chap. XXVIII. INHABITANTS, ETC. 641 \u00a7 18. Inhabitants, &c\u2014 The inhabitants of Polynesia belong to the Malay stock, but are of a very different type from the Mela nesians. Their characteristics are an olive complexion, long black hair, black eyes, aquiline nose, and good stature. Their intellectual capacities are fair: they have exhibited a capacity for civilization under European influence, and have embraced Christianity to a con siderable extent, relinquishing many of their most cherished ideas and practices, such as tatooing and tabooing: the Tonga, Cook, Navigator, Society, and Sandwich groups may be regarded as sub stantially Christianized, and the last has an Anglican bishop at the head of its Church. Their temper is generally mild and amiable ; but suspicion or ill-treatment renders them quite the reverse. Their weapons, textures, personal ornaments, and, above all, their canoes, exhibit a certain degree of mechanical skill. In some of the Caro linas a kind of hieroglyphical writing has been discovered. Several ofthe islands contain the remains of ancient edifices which bespeak a primeval civilization : such are found on Anson and Arago in the Marianas, Punipet or Ascension in the Carolinas, and on the isolated Easter Island. European influence. \u2014 Tbe presence of Europeans has produced veiy varying results : in the Marianas the population has been reduced from 100,000 in 1668, when they were first visited by Spanish Missionaries, to a mixed and low one of 5610 in 1864, and the native language has been utterly lost: on the other hand many valuable plants\u2014 coffee, indigo, arrow-root, sugar-cane, cotton \u2014 have been introduced by English and American settlers on the Sandwich, Society, and other islands ; and the natives have been instructed in tbe arts of printing, building, &c. At the same time the population has decreased in proportion to the in crease of civilization; that of the Society Islands does not exceed 18,000 ; Nukahiva has fallen from 18,000 or 12,000 (as it was variously estimated) in 1804 to 2690 in 1856 ; the Navigator group from 56,000 in 1840 to 35,000 ; and the Sandwich group from 73,138 in 1853 to 67,084 (exclusive of 2716 foreigners) in 1860. The growing traffic between Great Britain and Australia vid Panama, and between California and China, and the evident ambition of France to have an Australasian establishment as a counterpoise to English influence, impart an im portance to Polynesia which it has never hitherto possessed. The spots most frequented by Europeans are the harbours of Honolulu, on Oahu, in the Sandwich group ; Nukahiva, in the Marquesas ; Papeiti, on Tahiti, in the Society group ; and Apia, on Opolu, in the Navigator group. IV. \u2014 Antarctic Eegions. \u00a7 19. Lands and Islands. \u2014 Various tracts of land have been discovered in the direction of the Antarctic Pole ; but whether these are connected together in a great Antarctic continent, is uncertain. The vast extent of the ice-fields renders exploration more difficult here than in the neighbourhood of the Arctic Pole. The points that have been reached are Graham's Land and Louis Philippe Land, S. of"], [658, "642 ANTARCTIC REGIONS. Book V. Cape Horn ; Sabrina Land and Adelie Land, S. of Australia ; and South Victoria, S. of New Zealand. The last-mentioned was disco vered by Sir James Ross in 1839-43, who penetrated farther S. than any previous explorer, viz. to 78\u00b0 11' S. lat. He encountered a high glacier-wall extending for hundreds of miles and backed by mountains, of which Erebus (12,400 ft.) in 77\u00b0 33' is an active vol cano, and Terror (10,900 ft.) an extinct one. The Balleny islands, volcanic, in 163\u00b0 11' E. long., the South Shetlands, an archipelago in 53\u00b0 W. long., the South Orkneys more E., and the Sandwich Group in 27\u00b0 W. long., may be regarded as belonging to the supposed Ant arctic continent.
