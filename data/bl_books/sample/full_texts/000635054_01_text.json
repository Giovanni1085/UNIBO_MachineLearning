Although the official Correspondence with the Governor of the Cape of Good Hope, relative to the state of the Kafir tribes, and to the still recent outbreak on the Eastern frontier of the Colony, has already appeared in the form of a Blue Book, presented by Her Majesty's command to both Houses of Parliament, on the 31st of May, 1853, it may not in that shape have been accessible to the general reader. It is, therefore, considered to be essential to the object of the present work, to reprint, in these pages, Sir George Cath cart's own despatches, omitting those of others which have no direct bearing on its subject, for the purpose of connecting, or explaining, the circumstances and events alluded to in the Letters and Papers, some of a more private character, and later despatches, which are now published for the first time; in order to render as complete as possible the statement of facts which is submitted to the Public in this volume, with a view to the right understanding of the principles and policy which influenced and guided the military and the civil ad ministration of the Governor Lieut.-General Sir George Cath cart, and which resulted in the successful termination of the war, by the complete subjection of the rebellious tribes, without any compromise or treaty, which all former experi ence had shown to be of no avail with these people ; In the restoration of peace to the Colony, and the conse quent reduction of the heavy expenditure occasioned by the war; And in the wise and provident measures planned and effected by him for the future security and tranquillity of the fron tier, which had been so long exposed to the predatory inroads of the hostile Kafirs and rebellious Hottentots. a 2"], [8, "IV PREFACE. That the conduct of the gallant spirit by which results so important were achieved, may be appreciated at its full value, is the sole object for which these Records have been compiled. Posthumous praise cannot reach him who so well merited the approbation of his Sovereign and his country, cut off in the full career of his usefulness, and with the prospect of rising to the highest distinction. Ever foremost in the path of duty, he gloriously fell on the battle-field of Inkermann, and now rests in a soldier's grave in a distant land, where soldiers have, with the cross of Faith, marked and hallowed that spot called by the name of the General they honoured and loved (Cathcart Hill).* His spirit, his noble spirit, \" is returned to God who gave it,\" but it is left to the hand of affection to trace from his own words in this Publication, the portrait of a mind such as few have possessed, enriched as it was with the noblest qualities which form the character of a good man and a brave soldier. Every page testifies to his straightforward singleness of pur pose, and to the energy and ability with which he could over come the difficulties opposed to its accomplishment. The justice and moderation of the principles by which all his actions were regulated, gained for him even the esteem and respect of the savage Chiefs who were subdued as much by his clemency as by the force of his arms. Conscious of his own rectitude, he totally disregarded the disparaging doubts and the impatience by which his measures were assailed by interested parties, and steadfastly persevered in his laborious and often ungrateful task, until he had pa tiently and skilfully worked out the plan which he had con ceived with so much forethought from the beginning, to the successful issue which he had himself anticipated, the benefits of which will be long felt and acknowledged by a grateful people; and the memory of Sir George Cathcart, as a bene factor, will be cherished and revered at the Cape of Good Hope, so long as that Colony shall endure. * Col. Windham, and the other officers and men of the 4th Division, have erected a handsome solid granite monument, with an inscription in English and Russian."], [9, "ALPHABETICAL INDEX. AMATOLA. CATHCART.

SIR GEORGE CATHCART, K.C.B. To His Grace Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington. London, January 9, 1852, 10 p.m. My Loed Duke \u2014 I am this moment returned from an in terview with Lord Grey, according to his appointment. On the overture being made me to accept the appointment of the Government and command of the forces at the Cape of Good Hope, I did not fail to point out my own inferiority, in respect of the advantage of experience, to Sir Harry Smith, as well as the circumstance of my being junior to General Somer set, whose practical experience and local knowledge must be valuable, and would probably be lost by my appointment; I therefore requested, under these circumstances, to be allowed to consult your Grace before giving my answer. Lord Grey, however, told me the recall of Sir Harry Smith had been finally settled with his colleagues this day, and that it was not the intention of Her Majesty's Government to name General Somerset as his successor. His Lordship then read to me a passage respecting my eligibility, by which I under stood your Grace was pleased to consider me fit for the duty in the event of the appointment becoming vacant; Lord Grey having also told me that he desired to lay the matter before the B"], [24, "2 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S Queen to-morrow, I could only say that my humble services are at Her Majesty's command. This appointment comes upon me by surprise, and in many respects is far from desirable ; but as it is not of my own seek ing, and accepted only because I consider it an imperative call for duty, which it would be culpable and disgraceful in me to refuse, I trust your Grace will approve of my conduct in accepting it without further hesitation. As to the undertaking, I am aware of the many difficulties, both in civil and military affairs, I shall have to encounter; but I entertain the hope with sufficient confidence to make the attempt, that with energy, combined with patience, I may be able to perform my duty in a manner which may accord with the views of Her Majesty's Government, and prove beneficial to the colony. I have the honour, &c, (Signed) Geobge Cathcart, Major-General. Copy of Despatch from Governor Lieut.-General the Hon. G. Cathcart to Earl Grey. Government House, March 31, 1852. My Lord, \u2014 I have the honour to acquaint you, \u2014 (1.) that I arrived in Table Bay, in Her Majesty's ship \" Hydra,\" last night, and this morning, having assembled the Executive Council, I took the accustomed oaths in the usual manner. 2. Lieutenant-Governor Darling, who had arrived by the packet ship \" Harbinger \" before me, was also sworn in on this occasion as Lieutenant-Governor and Member of the Executive Council. 3. As the mail starts to-morrow it will be impossible for me to offer any opinions, or even enter upon public business, fur ther than to enclose the printed copy of the Ordinance for con stituting a Parliament for this colony, as it has passed the Legislative Council, by which you will observe important altera tions of the original draft Ordinance have been effected."], [25, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 3 4. Of these the most prominent are, \u2014 1st. The substitution of an elective franchise, for the election both of Members of the Council and Members of Assembly, of ownership with occupancy of premises, being either separately or jointly with land occupied therewith of the value of \u00a350 sterling, or the rental of premises for which a yearly rent of not less than \u00a310 is payable ; or the receipt of a salary at the rate of not less than \u00a350 per annum, or \u00a325 with board and lodg ing, for the simple occupancy of premises of the value of \u00a325, as originally determined upon by the Legislative Council. 2nd. The increase of qualification of Members of the Legis lative Council from the ownership of immovable property of the clear value of \u00a31000 sterling, or of immovable en cumbered property which would be of the value of \u00a31000 ster ling if it were unencumbered, and at the same time of property movable and immovable to the value of \u00a32000 above all just debts, to \u00a32000 and \u00a34000 in each case respectively. 3rd. The exclusion from voting at elections of persons hold ing offices of profit under the Crown has been abandoned; and 4th. The quorum in the Council and Assembly has been altered from three in the former and seven in the latter, as proposed in the draft Ordinance, to five and twelve in those bodies respectively. 5. Your Lordship will readily understand that alterations of so extensive a nature in the leading features of the proposed parliamentary constitution of the colony will require serious consideration before determining upon the course which it will be my duty to adopt ; and that, however anxious I may be to put an end to public anxiety upon this protracted question, I could not, under any circumstances, have reported in detail upon the subject by the present mail. 6. This unavoidable delay on my part is, however, to be less regretted, inasmuch as the Legislative Council has yet to com plete some formalities connected with the Constitution and Civil List Ordinances (a copy of the latter of which is also B 2"], [26, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 4 enclosed for your Lordship's information), and the members of that body, who will require to be re-sworn under my Commis sion before they can resume their legislative functions, cannot be convened until after the departure of the packet. I have, etc., (Signed) Geo. Cathcart. Despatch from Governor Lieut.-General the Hon. George Cathcart to Earl Grey. Government House, Cape of Good Hope, April 5, 1852. My Loud, \u2014 When I wrote to your Lordship within four and-twenty hours after my landing on the 31st March, which I was obliged to do, as the mail was on the point of departure, and the formal completion of the Ordinance could not be accomplished in any event in sufficient time to warrant the detention of the packet, I was principally influenced, neces sarily, by the opinions of Lieut.-Governor Darling, who had arrived a week before me,* and had consequently an advantage in point of time for gaining information. 2. The necessity for caution, under existing circumstances, even at the expense of further delay in the course I should adopt with reference to giving my sanction to the Ordinance which had passed the Legislative Council, in consequence of certain material alterations which had been made in it, were strongly urged by him. 3. I, however, lost no time, and spared no pains in personally investigating the subject, in all its bearings, to the best of my abilities. 4. I found that, after much angry debating and some change of opinion, the clauses, in which the qualification and franchise were raised to higher rates than had been contemplated, have * Having sailed in the \" Harbinger \" a week after the \" Hydra\" with Gene ral Cathcart."], [27, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 5 been agreed to by a majority, and that the Ordinance had been thus passed by the Legislative Council. 5. I found that some serious doubts had been started by the members of the Council, as to the effect of my arrival in that stage of the business, and whether it would be good in point of law if I were to give my assent to an Ordinance which had been matured and brought to its last stage, as far as they were concerned, by a Council constituted under the patent and in structions addressed to my predecessor. 6. On consulting the Attorney- General on this point, al though he expressed his own opinion that the objection would not be valid, he knew of no precedent, and thought the ques tion might admit of debate. 7. I found that there was alleged to be much dissatisfaction, and some mischievous agitation on foot, with reference to the question of an increased scale of franchise and qualification, which procrastination and suspense might render dangerous ; it appeared also that two members, who reside on the eastern frontier, were on the point of taking their departure, and that the general feeling was, that the session was virtually at an end. 8. Under these circumstances I reflected that, with regard to the objectionable clauses of the Ordinance, it would be still practicable, and a measure tending rather to remove than occasion any risk of permanent inconvenience and general dis satisfaction, were they to be lowered, if, when finally consi dered by Her Majesty in Council, they should be deemed too high; or even subsequently by Act of the future Colonial Par liament, with Her Majesty's confirmation, it would always be practicable to lower them, whilst it would be difficult, if not impossible, in either case, to raise the franchise or qualification, if once finally enacted on too low a scale. 9. Further, I duly considered the 34th clause of your Lord ship's Letter of Instruction to my predecessor, dated 15th Sep tember, 1851, in which it is positively enjoined that when these Ordinances have been passed by the Legislative Council they shall be transmitted to your Lordship, with a view to their"], [28, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 6 being altered where necessary, and then finally confirmed by an Order in Council. With these views, therefore, I determined to make no hin- drance to the progress of the Ordinance, but, on the contrary, to endeavour to remove any obstacle that might be thrown in its way. Accordingly, after having, on the 2nd instant,- assem- bled the Legislative Council for the purpose of swearing in the members, including his Honour the Lieutenant-Governor, and for other necessary business of routine, I again called them to- gether the following day for the purpose of going through the several stages of the Ordinance de novo at one sitting, with a view to removing all possibility of doubt as to the point of form in respect of my signature, and thereby place these Ordi- nances in the same relation towards me which they previously bore to my predecessor; and in doing so, I had ascertained that this was in accordance with the views of all the members of the Legislative Council, and had been so expressed by them before my arrival. 10. Lieutenant-Governor Darling, for reasons which he will no doubt himself explain, in the propriety of which I fully concur, did not attend this Council ; but the business intro duced, on my authority, by the Honourable Mr. Montague, who presided as Chairman, was earned through without any altera tion at one sitting without difficulty, and in a satisfactory manner. 11. As I intend to embark this afternoon on board Her Ma jesty's steam ship \" Styx,\" to proceed to the Buffalo, and thence to King William's Town, where Sir H. Smith awaits my arrival, I trust to Lieutenant-Governor Darling to give your Lordship all further details, together with the debates and minutes, and explain his own views relative to this subject. Although, imme diately on landing, Mr. Darling's views and arguments were so strongly in support of a necessity for an attempt to obtain a modification of the Ordinance, as to cause me for a moment to hesitate ; he now, on more mature consideration, coincides with me as to its propriety ; and it is a further satisfaction to me, that no delay was occasioned by the impossibility of my ob-"], [29, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 7 taining sufficient data to form my own judgment, and act upon it with confidence, before the departure of tlje mail on the 1st instant, as the Ordinances were not in a sufficient state of com pletion, from not being reprinted, to have sent them home by that opportunity, even had the packet been detained to any warrantable time. I have, &c, (Signed) Geo. Cathcart, Governor. Report to the Eight Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies, prepared, according to Earl Grey's instruc tions, hy the Hon. Lieut.-General G. Cathcart,* for the information of Her Majesty's Government and Par- liament. King William's Town, February 11, 1853. Sir, \u2014 In the report I now make of the affairs and conduct of the frontier war of rebellion in Her Majesty's South African possessions, from the time I assumed the command, on the 9th April last, to this date, I will first advert to \u2014 1st. The state of things as I found them. 2nd. The course pursued for the gradual but systematic, and, I trust, effectual removal of all obstacles, as far as in my power, to a restoration of a permanent state of peace. 3rd. The actual state of things ; and Lastly. My own views, founded on recent experience and careful consideration of the best measures calculated to prevent recurrence of the evils with which we have had to contend. First, then, in April, 1852, when I assumed the command, the real state of things as I found them was as follows : \u2014 \u25a0 The Gaika Chief Sandilli, and his associate chieftains, with their numerous followers, though somewhat disheartened by re cent active and successful operations, and less well provided with ammunition than they had been at the beginning of the war, were all still in occupation of their several locations, and * See Earl Grey's Despatch in Appendix to Minute, presented to Legisla tive Council, Letter A."], [30, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 8 though repeated patrols had passed through them, the rebels had been chased about from one haunt to another, but had never been driven out of their forest haunts ; their gardens and crops of Indian corn had been partially destroyed, but so early in the season that a second crop, it appears, had sprung up, which natural consequence was artfully taken advantage of by the Prophet Umlanjeni, who claimed the fact as a miracle worked by his power, and by which ruse his influence was greatly enhanced. In like manner, although the well-known mountain district of the Kroome range, in which the Waterkloof is only one of six or seven deeply and densely wooded concentric ravines, each several miles in length, radiating to all points of the compass, had been several times gallantly patrolled through, with more or less effect and loss on each occasion, the obsti nate Chief Macomo and his two or three thousand Kafir fol lowers had never been expelled from the district, but had dodged from one kloof to another, and re-occupied their former posi tions as soon as the troops had been withdrawn. At the time the command was delivered over to me, that ob stinate and crafty chief had associated with him the Tambook Chief Quesha, with numerous followers, as well as a very con siderable body of rebel Hottentots, well mounted and armed, who were the terror of the colony far within the boundary. These, in mixed bands of from 50 to 100 Kafirs and Hotten tots, issuing forth from their secure haunts on marauding forays, plundered the flocks and herds of the surrounding dis tricts to a great amount ; and in spite of all precautions, and not without severe encounters and loss of life on both sides, too often carried off their booty and lodged it in security, be yond the possibility of rescue, in their impenetrable recepta cles for such stolen property. At the same time, further south, and also within the colony, the petty Chiefs Seyolo, Stock, and Botman, each at the head of dariug followers \u2014 among whom were many rebel Hottentots \u2014 were lurking in the Keiskamma kloofs and Fish River bush,"], [31, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 9 and not only had since the commencement of the war effectu ally cut off all communication by the direct line between King William's Town and Graham's Town by Line Drift, but car ried devastation into the colony to the suburbs of Graham's Town, and far beyond it. One hundred miles north of this, the rebellious Tambookie tribes were still engaged in acts of spoliation and destruction of the property of the farmers of the districts of North Victoria, Albert, and Cradock. Although this war may have been at its commencement ag gravated, if not provoked, by unjustifiable aggression on the part of certain individuals of the burgher population of the north-eastern districts, it no doubt had become a part of the general war of races, and had it not been checked by the gal lant and able exertions of Captain Tylden,* of the Royal En gineers, who was sent thither by my predecessor to command, and who had organised a powerful force of native levies and burghers, of which he had made good use, it might have proved at least as formidable as that on the Kaffrarian frontier. This war, although much subdued, was not extinguished, and a system of captures and reprisals still prevailed, leaving the frontier in a state of insecurity and alarm, and obliging the abandonment of all border farms. The paramount Chief Kreili, who resides beyond the Kei, but whose hereditary and patriarchal influence is acknowledged, and extends over the whole of the Kafir tribes, was, notwith standing a recent invasion of his territory, still decidedly aiding and abetting in the war of races, and contumaciously refused to comply with an injunction imposed by my predecessor to pay a fine of 1500 head of cattle, for damage done to certain missionary and trading property within his territory. In the Sovereignty, 400 miles removed from my base of ope rations, and with which, from the nature of the intervening country, the course of postal communication often occupied a * See page 90."], [32, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 10 fortnight or three weeks' interval, although no open hostilities had occurred, a mistaken policy on the part of the Resident had provoked a system of petty warfare between the burgher population and the powerful Basuto people, along their whole extensive frontier ; and although both parties had abstained from destruction of property, captures of cattle and reprisals, with loss of life on both sides, were of frequent occurrence ; and the Resident, who adopted the cause of the burghers with out, as it appears to me, taking the course of investigation and mediation in cases where justice not only warranted but de manded it, having no military force to support his authority, had, on a former occasion, called into his aid certain petty na tive chieftains and their bands, whom he still openly instigated to vex and annoy the Basutos, whose powerful, and by no means ill-disposed, chief, he denounced as an enemy to the Queen. Although there did not appear to be any immediate danger in that quarter, reports led me to think that if this state of things were long suffered to continue, and the authority of the British Resident to be held in contempt, a war more difficult to manage and more expensive, because more remote, than the Kaffrarian war, must inevitably result, and one in which it is very questionable whether justice and good faith would be found to be on the side supported by the British Government. Added to these difficulties which remained for me to dispose of, a new feature in the border warfare had recently sprung up; this was an organised system among all the rebel Hottentots in arms, who, though separated in various laagers or camps under their respective commanders, had acknowledged the supreme authority of an able and influential Hottentot leader, of the name of William Uithaalder,* a pensioner from the Cape corps, who exercised the most arbitrary control over them ; the force obedient to his command, when all concen trated at his bidding might amount to about 400 well-armed * See Appendix to Minute presented to Legislative Council, Letter B."], [33, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 11 and well-mounted men, many of whom were trained and disci plined deserters : the advantage of secret information, derived from unsuspected confederates in the colony, and the facilities of sudden concentration, and, when the deed was done, of equally sudden dispersion among the hostile Kafirs, rendered these enemies difficult to deal with, so that on one occasion, at the Koonap, they proved but too successful, and once only, by the indefatigable exertions of Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre* and the gallant troops under his command, was it found possible to hunt them up or surprise them with any real effect, by any movement of regular troops. This is the true state of things as I found them in the month of April and beginning of May. At that time the army at my disposal had been employed in most active and harassing expeditions or patrols, without intermission, for fifteen months, and they were not in a state to resume active operations without a short repose ; especially the cavalry, whose horses, from hard service, scanty forage, and most unfavourable weather, I found reduced to a state almost of inanition, and for the time incapable of active service. I do not adduce these facts to lay claim to any merit in ultimately surmounting the difficulties they presented, but to justify a delay of nine months in the accomplishment of the task imposed upon me in my instructions, which popular error and too sanguine expectations seems to have led to a belief in England, at the time I assumed the command, might be ac complished in the short space of two or three months. Secondly. Having now stated the true state of things on the northern and eastern frontier as I found them, I proceed to advert to the measures I adopted to meet them ; and as my official series of reports are already in your possession, I need not enter into details, but merely recapitulate the leading facts. In my first military despatch, t and, indeed, previously, when * See page S6. + See page 36."], [34, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 12 I first undertook this command, before my departure from England, I enunciated the principle upon which I intended to act, which was to commence systematically and proceed pro gressively to make good and maintain all advantages already gained, or which I might be able to gain, commencing first with the colony itself, and working outwards, and to this course I have steadily adhered. The first measure was, by means of a post at the Temacha,* and the renewal of the post at Line Drift, to re-open the direct communication with Graham's Town, most essential for commissariat supplies as well as military operations, but which had been cut off since the commencement of the war; this was attended with complete success, and has continued available ever since, without a single interruption of the com munication, besides enabling me to extend a friendly tribe along the frontier, and displace a most troublesome enemy, the Chief Seyolo, who, from the constant annoyance occa sioned to him by patrols from the post situated in the centre of his location, at length surrendered, and is now a prisoner at Cape Town. 2. To provide against the invasion of the colony by the for midable and lawless marauders to whom I have above adverted, a mounted polices was forthwith organised, as the only means of coping with enemies of that peculiar description ; the emergency required that this force should be immediately effec tive, and although in its organisation I studied its ready adap tation to civil purposes, and future transfer to colonial charge, I could only raise it in time to be of use under martial law, and as a military levy. It may, no doubt, be considered expensive in its first organi sation, but a cheap thing would have been a certain failure, and a bad thing would have been of no use. It was very satisfactory to me that it met with your sanction and ap proval. Sec page 58. t See page 50."], [35, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 13 The success of this measure in protecting the colony from marauding inroads has surpassed my most sanguine expecta tions ; the energies of the colonists have been called into full activity in their own defence, and the gallantry and zeal evinced by this police has mainly contributed to the extinction of a system of guerilla warfare, which promised to become most troublesome, and most difficult to be dealt with by regular troops, and, if not checked at once, most likely to resuscitate the rebellion within the colony in its full force. This establishment, though large and expensive at the outset, has in a great measure done its work, and is no longer required to the same extent ; it has already been much reduced. Owing to the improved circumstances, advantages gained by the troops, and their own good services, by the end of the quarter, will not, I hope, entail a permanent expense of more than at the rate of 30,000/. per annum, pay, lodging, rations, horses, in short, everything included, and must become a colonial charge as soon as the Colonial Government may be settled so as to venture upon the provision and appropriation of colo nial money for a new object. 3. The next step was an attempt to restrain, if not expel, the marauding tenants of the Waterkloof,* with such force as I could then withdraw with safety from Kaffraria and the southern extremity of the colonial frontier; but though the available force then at my disposal was not sufficient immedi ately to accomplish that object, three or four days' active opera tions caused the dispersion of a large portion of the enemy, and the establishment of a post in the centre, garrisoned by a battalion, and a closer investment by surrounding posts, held them sufficiently under control to complete satisfactory arrange ments for leaving the colony in a sufficient state of security during my absence, to enable me to attend to another duty which I considered immediate and indispensable to the accom- * See page 88."], [36, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 14 plishment of the great end in view \u2014 the termination of the war. 4. This was an invasion* of the territory of the paramount Chief Kreili, and the infliction of a sufficient chastisement to deter him from aiding and abetting the Gaika rebellion. A fine had been imposed by my predecessor of 1500 head of cattle, which was left unpaid ; when, after the capture of some 30,000 head of cattle, the army, after a former expedition, had crossed the Kei. On a demand for the payment of this fine, and an acknow ledgment of good faith and peaceable intentions being made by me to the Chief Kreili, my letter had been contemptuously returned. The expedition, therefore, became indispensable ; and in the course of the month of August it was accomplished, with a capture of 10,000 head of cattle. In order to stimulate the energies of the colony, and show to the Chief Kreili that, independent of Her Majesty's forces, there was a power in the colony capable of protecting itself; and with a view also to the ulterior establishment of a sufficient burgher population in the extensive plains north of the Ama tolas, to serve hereafter as a barrier sufficient for the future garrison of that salient but at present vulnerable portion of the country, independent of military aid, I called out the burgher force of the frontier districts; but, finding some symptoms of supineness in some quarters where their own private interests were not immediately concerned, I addressed a circulars to the Civil Commissioners, and gave it publicity, in which I took occasion to place the circumstances and obligations of the colonists, as well as those of the Government, in their true light, and without disguise ; and in doing so in plain terms, \u2014 for I value neither popularity nor unpopularity when actuated and supported by a sense of duty, \u2014 I only called their attention to principles and truths which had been laid down by Her See page 89. + See page 102."], [37, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 15 Majesty's Government, already before the public, and of which they were cognisant. This address was characterised as severe, but not unkind, and was received, as I expected it would be, in good part ; and I had every reason to be well satisfied with the patriotic exer tions which it called forth. The result of this expedition has also satisfied my most san guine expectations, for from that time to this not only has the Chief Kreili ceased to aid and abet hostilities, but has on several occasions used his influence to endeavour to put a stop to them ; and although I was satisfied with the penalty inflicted, and never made any further demand, the chief has since, of his own accord, paid up instalments of the original fine to the amount of 700 head of cattle, is now collecting more, and is desirous of peace. On my return from the Kei, I held a meeting of the friendly chiefs,* and pointed out to them the blessings of peace, and the vast comparative advantages they enjoyed from their faithful conduct; and they have continued to do their utmost to evince their loyalty and attachment, and to obey the injunctions of the Chief Commissioner. Meanwhile, during my absence, the precautions I had adopted previously to my departure had suf ficed to keep the frontier of the colony in a greatly improved state of security and peace, which, though not entirely undis turbed by occasional robberies, was far more satisfactory and promising than any state of things which had been experienced since the war first broke out. 5. Having returned to Fort Beaufort, and as soon as a sufficient force could be assembled, which advantages gained and secured now enabled me to do, on the 15th September I resumed operations, in good earnest, for the clearance of the Kroome fastnesses, and final extinction of that great nuisance and principal obstacle to the restoration of peace within the colonial frontier. f * See page 127. t See page 118."], [38, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 16 Three days' unparalleled exertions of the troops, I might say days and nights, for they lay on the ground where they left off at night, and resumed operations at daybreak the fol lowing mornings, sufficed for this purpose ; the whole district was cleared. Macomo and Quesha at length were compelled to fly, and the establishment of two additional small entrenched field posts, one at the entrance, and the other in the centre of the Waterkloof, with that already erected at the commanding apex of the whole range, have sufficed for the final accomplish ment of this most important object ; since which time, (five months have elapsed,) not a single Kafir or rebel Hottentot has attempted to harbour there, and scarcely an instance of cattle stealing has occurred in the neighbouring districts, which had so long and severely suffered from this nuisance. The next measure which immediately followed, was a thorough clearance of the still more extensive and difficult Amatola * districts, by the indefatigable exertions of Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre, to whom I was able to give sufficient force for the pur pose ; and the system of the establishment of temporary posts in the right places, from which constant patrols could be earned on, has also kept it now for some months entirely untenanted except by the troops ; the Chiefs Sandilli and Macomo, with some ten or twelve attached followers, pertinaciously lurked for some weeks in its recesses, but were constantly hunted about, frequently narrowly escaping capture, until they too have fled to the banks of the Kei, where they now are.t 6. These things having been accomplished, I turned my attention to the war, which, though languishing, was far from being extinguished, on the Tambookie frontier. A previous commission of inquiry into the cause and circumstances of that war having convinced me that the time was now come when it might and ought to be put an end to, and that the hostile chiefs were ready and desired to make submission on any terms, and obtain pardon and peace, I received their See page 123. + See page 144."], [39, ""], [40, "7._y,1856 W.W\u00abt,lath;5 .FUtlan G\u00abrd\u00ab_"], [41, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 17 submission and surrender of arms, dictated terms which I con sidered equitable, and granted peace. In this I was ably assisted by Assistant Commissioner Owen, and the Civil Com missioner, Mr. Calderwood. By these terms, which have been duly proclaimed, a new and well-defined boundary, somewhat circumscribed, was assigned to them, and the whole Tambookie people were placed under the chief control of the head of the Umtirara branch, now a minor, but whose regent, Nonesi, had remained loyal during the war, and, to avoid the danger of her people being drawn into it, had with her faithful followers migrated beyond the Bashee, until the contest should be over; this loyal portion of the tribe has now, at my invitation and permission, granted in Her Majesty's name, returned; since this peace was made, perfect good faith has been observed, not a single cattle theft has been reported, a Resident, Mr. Warner, is now living in the district, and implicit obedience is given to his instructions. Boers, as well as English farmers, now have returned to their farms, and enjoy a state of peace and security unknown to them for the last two years. The lands, however, formerly allotted to the Tambookie Chief Mapassa, which were always too extensive for that tribe, and never adequately occupied, have been forfeited to the Crown;* that chief, who has been the most guilty during the rebellion, having been killed, and the tribe nearly annihilated, has been dispersed with their own concurrence among the others, and own the paramount chieftainship of the Umtirara branch. This has enabled me at once, and with a promise of success far beyond my most sanguine expectation, to bring into that important district a sufficiently dense population for mutual support and combined security, composed of farmers of Euro pean origin, and of both Dutch and English extraction, and thus to provide for the defence of a large portion of the eastern * See Plan annexed. C"], [42, "TEE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 18 frontier, north of the Amatolas, in an open plain, where a commando of 400 mounted burghers is capable of maintaining their position, and keeping the neighbouring native tribes at a distance. A village called Queen's Town, on the Kamana, in the dis trict of Victoria, has been already commenced ; 800 applica tions for farms and erven, or town lots, from persons of Dutch and English origin, have been already submitted to a provi sional Land Commission on the spot, of which the First Assistant Surveyor- General is a member, appointed to inves tigate their merit, and make the allotments; and 300 have been already located. Many of these new frontier settlers are Boers from the more northern districts, and thereby is evinced a salutary reaction towards \" treking\" inwards, instead of any desire to emigrate. As a covenant is inserted in the provisional titles to these farms and erven, to secure military organisation for self-defence, on principles of old-established colonial usage and not opposed to law, I have full confidence in the immediate efficacy and ultimate complete success of this measure. As the details are communicated in my despatch, No. 43, of the 29th November, 1852,* I only advert to this subject here as a link in the pro gressive policy I have adhered to, and an important advantage gained towards the establishment of a lasting peace. These things having been done, I was able to report that the war of rebellion along the whole colonial frontier was virtually at an end ; f but I also explained that as, in fact, according to my humble opinion, it never had been a war, properly so called, but an insurrection and rebellion of Her Majesty's subjects against the sovereign authority, there is no legitimate or recog nised antagonistic power west of the Kei with which any treaty of peace can be made, and no terms can be made with out standing rebels till they are subdued and submit. The time * See page 156. f See page 153."], [43, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 19 for general pardon and amnesty has not yet arrived; but I trust the period is not far distant when that final act of grace may be safely and expediently proclaimed, without compro mising the dignity of the Crown, or giving advantage or encouragement to the enemy, and with the attainment of all practicable ends. 7. There yet remained one rankling sore to be healed before it could be safely said that all was peace, and that the main tenance of a large force could be safely dispensed with ; I allude to the protracted state of petty warfare which existed in the Sovereignty between the dependants of the paramount Basuto Chief Moshesh and a portion of the burgher population bordering on his territory, associated with certain land specu lators, and who had been supported by the British Resident, who also had called in to his assistance certain petty native bands or tribes, too feeble to afford any real assistance, but who had raised exorbitant claims for their losses sustained in the cause of Government. This war originated in disputed claims to property occa sioned by any arbitrary demarcation of boundary, the justice and good faith of which is very questionable, and still remains for amicable and equitable adjustment, without which it can never be permanent. In the meantime, violent measures and an irritating warfare having been adopted on the part of Government, and the Chief Moshesh having been denounced an enemy to the Queen, suc cessful retaliation had been adopted on his part, and the balance of spoliation rested on his side. I considered it indispensable that this state of warfare should be put an end to, as, till that should be done, it would be impossible to take any steps towards carrying into effect mea sures in respect to the future government of those countries which I believe to be now seriously contemplated by Her Majesty's Government. Before entering the territory, I duly proclaimed that I came c 2"], [44, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 20 to administer equal justice to all classes of Her Majesty's sub jects, and commanded all to remain in their respective locations, and not to take part in any hostilities that might ensue, in order that I might restore peace without engendering new claims or animosities. Nevertheless, false expectations appear to have arisen on the part of those whom Government influ ence had hitherto favoured, that I should unscrupulously con tinue to exercise, to their peculiar benefit, might irrespective of right. The course I did pursue has been duly reported in other despatches,* and the result has proved the enforcement of a just penalty, and the restoration of peace and security of pro perty, with every prospect of stability, unless disturbed by wilful indiscretion or evil design on the part of the colonists, who, should that be the case, are now warned that they must protect themselves from the consequences, whereby, should it be the policy of Her Majesty's Government to abandon the Sovereignty, the aborigines and the white men may now sepa rate on good terms, and are in a fit state for an amicable and equitable diplomatic adjustment of their line of demarcation; whilst the paramount Chief Moshesh, instead of being a de clared enemy, is now, and would remain, a faithful ally ; and this he has evinced by exercising a salutary control over Morosi and other chieftains south of the Orange River, who, during this state of hostilities, have, as partisans in his cause, proved most troublesome on the border of the colonial district of Albert, but whose depredations have now entirely ceased. 8. I am now turning my attention to the better organisation and supervision of the Fingoe locations of Fort Peddie, Fort Beaufort, and Alice, and the establishment of a new one at some intermediate point, so that the whole extent of that part of the district of Victoria, formerly called the ceded territory, See pages 168, 169."], [45, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 21 between the Keiskamma and Fish Rivers, will be occupied by that warlike and faithful people, who have rendered the most willing and gallant services throughout this war. This people show great aptitude for civilisation, and have made much progress ; and as they have a mortal hatred for the Kafirs, their former tyrants, and are interested in the vigilant care of their own cattle, they will serve as the best possible barrier for the security of the colony beyond the Fish River, provided they be fairly dealt with, kept in due subordi nation by superintendents who speak their language, protected against colonial prejudice and injustice, and allowed to live in peace, and without infringement or breach of faith, in the allot ments granted to them. 3rd. Now as to the existing state of things in respect to the eastern frontier of this part of Her Majesty's South African dominions : \u2014 The nuisance of the Waterkloof having been removed, the colonial border is almost free from marauders, and its security amply provided for by the existing mounted police, which has been reduced to the three districts of Victoria, Albany, and Fort Beaufort. The only T'Slambie territorial chief, Seyolo, engaged in the rebellion, is a prisoner at Cape Town. Moshesh and the Basutos, humbled by the recent chastise ment, have evinced every proof of their sincerity and desire to remain at peace with the British Government, and confidence and good understanding appears to have been restored to that vast region beyond the Orange River; since the penalty was inflicted on the chief for his contumacy, not a single theft has been reported, and he has on several occasions evidenced his desire to preserve the peace and keep faith. The Tambookie rebellion has been happily disposed of, and the forfeited portion of their territory is filling rapidly with a sturdy burgher population ; upwards of 800 applications for farms or erven having been sent in, and 300 already located,"], [46, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 22 whilst the Tambookies, united under the paramount chieftain ship of the loyal Umtirara branch, have settled down in pro found peace in their appointed location. The Amatolas and whole Gaika district entirely cleared of Kafirs or Hottentots, the chiefs having fled to the banks of the Kei, and the whole tribe dispersed, many, though not all, having crossed the Kei. Not a shot has been fired, or a cattle theft reported in British Kaffraria for the last two months ; but the Gaika race are not, and cannot be, exterminated, even if that should be required ; some, no doubt, linger in the kloofs and woods which border the Kei itself, and from which it would be fruitless to attempt to force them ; for though that service might be nominally accomplished, and with ease, by the force now disposable, it would require a month's campaigu, and, as subsequent occupation in force to maintain this advan tage would be out of the question, they would recross the moment the troops were withdrawn. Part of this country, I find, has never been surveyed or even explored. The Chief Sandilli and his associates are there, not in force, but living separately with a few followers ; they have, it seems, occasion ally crossed the Kei, but they appear to be reluctant to become subjects of Kreili, though they acknowledge his supremacy as paramount chief; and, on the other hand, it is said that Kreili and his counsellors do not desire their intrusion. The war is thus driven into a corner, and these chiefs per sonally only remain to be dealt with ; meantime, the Gaika district is securely occupied, and a large force is now avail able. There remains only one feature of this rebellion to which distinct and separate allusion has not been made in the above report, and which, though now reduced to insignificance, was not oniy peculiar, but most influential at the commencement. I allude to the disaffection of a large portion of the Hottentot population. This has not been by any means so general\" as has been"], [47, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 23 supposed, and as colonial prejudices would still represent it to have been. Nothing could have been more satisfactory than the conduct of the Cape Corps generally, with the exception only of those who deserted at the outbreak, and numerous Hotteutot levies have rendered gallant and loyal services throughout the contest. Measures have been taken, and with good success, by means of proscription of the more guilty leaders, and rewards for their apprehension, and the lenient punishment of two years' impri sonment with hard labour, by sentence of court-martial, to those less guilty, and not being deserters, who have surrendered ; and numerous cases now occur of offenders who are constantly coming in to surrender and take the benefit of that mild mode of expiating their crime, and returning to their allegiance ; by this and other means, among which I must not omit to mention the unparalleled exertions and gallant conduct of the Albany, Victoria, and Fort Beaufort mounted police, \" Brauder,\" their most daring leader, has disappeared ; and I believe there is no doubt he was killed by the Albany police in the last desperate skirmish in the Fish River bush ; the organised band has been entirely broken up, and \" Uithaalder,\" their general, is a fugitive, without influence or followers. In order to heal this only remaining unhealthy trace of the rebellion, I intend immediately to send the two Assistant Com missioners to Eland's Post, where most of the loyal tenants of the Kat River settlement have remained under the protection of the small garrison stationed there throughout the contest, and who, latterly, have been most judiciously cared for by Captain Wright, 91st Regiment, an officer who has rendered most valuable services on every occasion on which they have been called forth. I purpose forming a Commission, by associating that officer and Mr. Calderwood, Civil Commissioner of the Victoria district, with the Assistant Commissioners, Mr. Owen and"], [48, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 24 Mr. Ebden, in order to ascertain and register those who have proved loyal, and have claims to land in the settlement, as well as those whose claims are forfeited ; and as in few cases any titles have yet been granted, I purpose following their investi gation up by a provisional Land Commission, and to confirm the titles of the loyal, but to recommend, after investigation as to character, applicants for vacant allotments to me for grants, and I hope by that means, and on the principle already suggested in a former despatch, to be able to mix occupants of European origin in sufficient proportion among the community which shall hereafter inhabit that rich and fertile district, to break up the exclusive nationality, and by example, and supe rior industry and civilisation, render it what it ought to be, but what it never has been, the most flourishing agricultural district in the colony. I place sanguine reliance on the efficacy of this measure for the gradual extinction of animosities between the Hottentot and European races, which have been the natural result of the recent rebellion, and which time, I trust, will finally accomplish, and which, when accomplished, I do not think, after their severe sufferings on this occasion, likely again ever to be renewed. 4th. Having now given, I trust, a faithful account of the affairs of this frontier up to the present date, it remains for me, as required by my instructions, to offer my opinions and suggestions in respect to future policy. In doing this I must restrict myself to that which I believe to be practicable and expedient. It is true that promised advantages have been gained, and are maintained by force of arms, and that a state of peace and security has been restored within the colony, during the last two months, to an extent unknown for many years ; but it is also true that the Gaika race, originally amounting to some 27,000 souls, though expa triated, dispersed, and subdued, still live somewhere, though they are nowhere to be found. To have recourse to active"], [49, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 25 hostilities, with a view of harassing them, would be to harass the troops in fighting with a shadow, and with what ultimate object? The object of this long contest is undoubtedly and avowedly the establishment of peace on a permanent basis ; and the enemy having entirely evacuated their own country, and been driven to the banks of the Kei, or across it, it becomes a question what more is to be done. If we remain unsatisfied with the present state of things, and pertinaciously persevere in unforgiving hostilities and outlawry, peace and amnesty can never be proclaimed ; and there can be no security against constant attempts to plunder cattle, and disturb the new-expected inhabitants of the Amatolas, by bands of marauders assembled under some one or other of the pro scribed and outlawed chieftains \u2014 the only real advantage gained would be in the removal of the nuisance to a greater distance from the colony ; but the necessity for the maintenance of a large force to keep this vantage ground would remain nearly the same. In order, therefore, to put an end to this rebellion, and pro vide the means of controlling turbulent spirits who still might be disposed to be disturbers of the peace, without the necessity for so large a force kept constantly on the alert, so that the heavy military expenditure for this service might be reduced, I have, after the most careful consideration, come to the con clusion that the moment has arrived when it would be safe, politic, and expedient to extend the Royal pardon to the late rebels, now sufficiently humbled and subdued, and, collecting them, place them in a new country, where they can be more easily dealt with than in the mountains and forest districts they formerly occupied, and unite them under the responsibility of a recognised chief, who should have power to control them, and be held responsible for their conduct. The slightest knowledge of the Kafir character, habits, and"], [50, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 26 customs, will suffice to convince that no ruler can have any in fluence over a tribe of the Amakosa race but the hereditary and legitimate chief, or paramount chief \u2014 he may be expelled and exiled, but he cannot be deposed, nor can he be deprived of the devoted attachment of his people, who will follow his fortunes, and so long as he lives, will yield obedience to no other authority ; it stands to reason, therefore, that the only way of putting an end to the Gaika rebellion, with a prospect of per manent security, is to pardon the Chief Sandilli, if he will make due submission and return to his allegiance, and that he will hold himself responsible for the good conduct of the Gaika people. This course, therefore, I have it in contemplation to pursue, so soon as a favourable opportunity may offer. The land in which I intend to locate the Ama-Gaika tribe is a portion of that through which the Kabousie River runs, between the Amatolas and the Kei. As the western boundary, I would give the road leading from King William's Town, north, past Duhue German Mission Station, and Possel's Missionary Station, into the country of the Windvogelberg, the Kei on the east, the Thomas River on the north, and Umhala's country on the south. This large tract of fine country was allotted to the loyal Chief Toise, who never was able fully to occupy it ; and now during the recent rebellion, having carried his loyalty beyond that of the other T'Slambies in the way of obtaining and giving information, being also a weak man, he has so entirely lost the confidence and attachment of his people, that the majority, under his brother's rule, have been active associates with the Gaikas in open rebellion. Toise, who now lives near Fort Murray, could not therefore occupy this country in safety, and, in fact, many of the expa triated Gaikas are now secreted in it. I propose, therefore, giving to him in exchange that part of the forfeited Gaika ter ritory which lies between the road, already adverted to as a line"], [51, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 27 of demarcation, and the base of the Amatolas at the Kabousie Neck and Mount Kempt, and southward to the Yellow Woods, seven miles from King William's Town. I cannot, however, by this post place this part of my report otherwise than as prospective, and in like manner the fina settlement of peace with the paramount Chief Kreili is not yet concluded ; but the humble tone of that chief, and earnest desire for peace evinced by his voluntary payment of instal ments of an old fine of trifling amount, the remainder of which I am now prepared to remit, leave me in no doubt as to a speedy and satisfactory reconciliation with him. Assuming, then, that these arrangements shall be satisfac torily adjusted, I proceed to the question of what military esta blishment may be necessary for the permanent security of this frontier. I enclose a separate tabular statement bearing on this subject, by which it will appear that I cannot advise a reduc tion in the first instance of more than three regiments of In fantry, one of Cavalry, and one company of Royal Artillery, from this command. In due time a further reduction may possibly be practicable and safe, but the voted establishment and force estimated as sufficient by my predecessors on the return of peace too hastily on several former occasions I can never recommend, because prevention being unprovided for, the cure is certain to become so expensive, that it may be questionable whether the in convenience of the disease be worth the remedy. I am of opinion that the lowest amount of force required for the security of the colony, for some time to come, will be two battalions of Infantry within the colonial boundary and four in British Kaffraria, and one at Cape Town in reserve and for repose, as well as to give support to the Executive during the transition from the existing to the contemplated new form of government, and available for the support also of the detach ment at Natal in case of need."], [52, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 28 Eight hundred Cavalry I also consider necessary, and this I would recommend should be provided for by the completion of the Cape Corps to its establishment, and the division of it into two battalions for the sake of better management and disci pline ; this would allow of the withdrawal of the regiment of Dragoons, which description of force I consider, for many rea sons, ill adapted for this particular service. The voted staff should be remodelled and adapted to existing circumstances, and proportioned to the force; and I accord ingly enclose a statement of what I consider requisite under that head. Assuming the government of British Kaffraria to be placed under a Lieutenant-Governor, as already provided by Letters Patent, dated 16th December, 1850, but which, under circumstances stated in a separate despatch, No. 50,* of this date, have not yet been acted upon, I am decidedly of opinion that a Major-General should be in chief command of the forces in this colony and its dependencies, under precisely the same circumstances and allowances as in Canada, and that then the whole duties of the Government would best be entrusted to a Civil Governor- General, and that no Lieutenant-Governor would be required. I do not see any reason why the government and military command in this colony should not be based precisely on the same principle as that of Canada, excepting only in such slight differences of establishment as local circumstances may render necessary, and which I have endeavoured to provide for in the outlines of the estimate which accompany this paper. Before closing this voluminous, but I trust not unnecessarily prolix, Report, required of me in my original instructions, I must advert to a question of primary importance, but concern ing which I think, on mature consideration, and with a correct * Sec page 1S4."], [53, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 29 knowledge of the existing state of things as they have been above set forth, there can scarcely be two opinions, whether it would be practicable or expedient at this time to recede from the barrier of the Kei, and adopt any other more restricted limits to Her Majesty's South African possessions in this par ticular quarter ? Whether it be to revert to the boundary of the Keiskamma or the Fish River, and abandon again British Kaffraria to the independent rule of the Kafirs ? I have only to repeat officially my opinion already privately communicated by last post, that we cannot now at this time recede from the Kei as the ultimate boundary of this portion of Her Majesty's South African possessions ; also, that British Kaffraria, be tween the Kei and the Keiskamma, so much of it at least as is comprised in the Amatola district and the T'Slambie locations, cannot at present be annexed to the colony, or placed under colonial laws or management with safety. With reference to the question, whether it might not be ad visable to abandon Kaffraria altogether, adopt the Keiskamma as our eastern frontier, and erect military posts on the line of heights running parallel to that river on its right bank, it is my firm conviction that such a measure, if not now next to impos sible, on account of our engagements to white settlers in Bri tish Kaffraria, who have been allowed to take root, as it were, at King William's Town, would be most disastrous at this par ticular time, for the following reasons: \u2014 abandonment of the field would give to our enemies, now driven beyond the Kei, and expelled from their location, which has been declared for feited, the advantage which they have so pertinaciously con tended for \u2014 the recovery and re-occupation of their former territory \u2014 and even more than that, the recovery of their inde pendence. This termination of the contest would not fail to be proclaimed to all surrounding native tribes, and revive the war of races, extending possibly to Natal, with renewed hopes of being able by perseverance ultimately to drive the white"], [54, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 30 man into the sea\u2014 hopes which gave union and strength to this last war in a degree never before known among native tribes opposed to European troops, but which have recently, but only recently, been given up in despair ; hopes powerfully stimulated, if not originally awakened, by the Prophet Umlan jeni, who, by their disappointment, has been thrown into con tempt and rendered powerless, but whose dangerous influence would immediately be revived with increased power by a retro grade step, and apparent fulfilment of his prophecies. Again, though peace might possibly be purchased for a few years by such concession, war would be certain to recur with redoubled energy before long, and the field of battle would be brought again, for the third time, into a country from which the Kafirs were fortunately expelled, before they possessed and could use fire-arms as they do now, and before they became leagued with Hottentots in a common cause, but which coun try of the Keiskamma and Fish River, from the Amatolas to the sea, is, perhaps, the most intricate and favourable to Kafirs, in their mode of warfare, which the whole of South Africa affords. If it should ultimately become the policy of Her Majesty's Government to recede from the Kei, abandon British Kaffraria, and allow the reflux of the savage tribes triumphantly to the Keis kamma, this is not the moment when it would be a safe measure ; hereafter, not as the immediate result of an obstinate contest, but after an interval of peace and as a voluntary act of grace, it might possibly be attended with less ruinous consequences.

My Lord, \u2014 I cannot, of course, make myself acquainted sufficiently with the actual state of things on the frontier, by information obtained at this place to enable me to add to that contained in the despatches of Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Smith, which will be sent home by the mail which starts to- morrow. Your Lordship will observe that some vigorous exertions have been made, and with good success, in again clearing the"], [59, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 33 strong ground called the Kroome Range, in which is situated the stronghold called the Waterkloof, the haunt of the Kafir leader Macomo, with his clansmen and Hottentot confederates, and subsequently in the Amatolas against his younger brother, but far more powerful Kafir Chief Sandilli ; with whom the present war in fact commenced. From what I can learn, however, it appears to me that hos tilities have for the present subsided into a most unsatisfactory sort of lull, owing to the adoption by the Kafirs of a similar course of evasion and non-resistance to that which they have practised on former occasions towards the close of a protracted contest, but upon which experience shows no reliance can be placed as a sign of subjugation, or an indication of returning fidelity and good-will ; and in a private letter which I received on my arrival, Sir Harry Smith appears to be fully of that opinion. It is my intention, if possible, to leave this in Her Majesty's ship \" Styx\" for the Buffalo Mouth, on Monday next, April 5 ; and I hope by next post to be able to make a more detailed report of the affairs of the eastern frontier than I am able to do on the present occasion.

Cloete, Quartermaster-General. (True Extract) John Garvock, Lieutenant-Colonel. Copy of a Despatch from Governor Lieut.-General the Hon. G. Cathcart to Earl Grey. King William's Town, April 20, 1852. My Lord, \u2014 I have the honour to acquaint you, that after closing my despatch to your Lordship, dated Cape Town, 5th April, 1852, I embarked that afternoon on board Her Ma jesty's ship \" Styx,\" and proceeded on my voyage to the Buf falo Mouth. I arrived at East London on the night of the 8th April, and next morning (9th) having landed the horses which I had brought with me, an operation which, although the bar was in a favourable state, is always one of some dif ficulty, I was able to proceed at noon, and reached King Wil liam's Town before midnight. On the following morning (10th) I had a most satisfactory interview with Lieutenant- General Sir Harry Smith, who devoted the whole of that day to the purpose of giving me every insight into the affairs of the colony generally, and more particularly of the eastern frontier, in his power to communicate, and he took his de-"], [63, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 37 parture the following morning for Cape Town by the return of the \" Styx.\" Sir H. Smith gave me the perusal of his last despatch in tended for your Lordship, in which he has brought down the military affairs of this frontier to the period of my arrival to relieve him in the command. Since then, reports have arrived of three affairs, one in which a patrol of a detachment of Major- General Somerset's command, with which he was operating in the open country north of the Amatolas ; and another of Major Tottenham, of the 12th Lancers, on the Kabousie River, to the eastward of the Amatolas ; and a third, in which Lieute nant-Colonel Eyre, in entering the Amatola country, on his return to his camp at Keiskamma Hoek, fell in with some cattle, supposed to belong to the Sub-chief Auta, in the north eastern corner of that mountain district, which he captured, but not without serious resistance, and some loss in wounded : and one officer, Captain Gore of the 43rd, I regret to say, fell on this occasion. I have desired the Quartermaster-General to prepare a de tailed statement of these affairs from the period at which Sir Harry Smith's last despatch was closed, and they require no comment from me, as they rest upon the arrangements of my predecessor, whose views and intentions are explained in his despatch. I have now to state to your Lordship my own views, and the means by which I purpose carrying into effect, with the object of providing for the better security of the frontier districts of the colony within the boundary, the speedy termi nation of this Kaffrarian war, and such measures, as at present advised, I consider most likely to prevent a recurrence of so serious and expensive a calamity. I thought it necessary, on assuming the command, to lose no time in notifying to all the inhabitants of Kaffraria my views and intentions towards them. These are contained in the enclosed* copy of my Proclamation, which I have addressed * All enclosures of Summaries, General Orders, &c, not printed in the volume, are to be found in the Blue Book of May 31st, 1853."], [64, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 38 by name to all those chiefs, their council and people, who have remained faithful to their allegiance during these rebellious times ; and I have alluded to the course which I consider it to be my duty to pursue towards the Chief Sandilli and the sub chiefs associated with him in rebellion, to mark that I will not treat with him, but consider him an outlaw whilst on this side of the Kei. I drew up this notice in concert with the Assistant Commissioner, Major Hogge, and Colonel Mackinnon, who are at present with me ; and I also availed myself of the experi ence and great knowledge of Kafir character possessed \u25a0 by the sub-commissioner to the T'Slambie tribes, Captain Maclean, to whose firm and judicious management the fidelity of the T'Slambie tribes may in great measure be ascribed. This last named officer has undertaken the promulgation of the notice ; and, judging from the rapidity with which they carry on their communications by messengers and signals, I have no doubt it is long ere this known throughout Kafirland. It is my intention to keep permanent possession of the Amatolas, and with that view to leave a sufficient force under Colonel Eyre in the Keiskamma Hoek, which commands the sources of that river, and the most fertile feeding ground. I intend shortly to visit the spot, and to cause to be erected a stone tower or blockhouse, according as materials may suit, which may suffice at little expense as a rallying point for a few men, the fire of whose musketry from the top might effectually protect those left in the camp, when the troops might be out on patrol, from any sudden attack by an enemy who is by no means to be despised, who has not yet evacuated that country, and would return in full force if allowed to do so ; but even should this tower be superfluous as a defensive precaution, I have a still more important object in view, which is that of a demonstration of the intention of permanent occupancy. It is obvious, that whilst not only an invitation but an injunction has gone forth to Sandilli and all his rebel asso ciates to evacuate the Amatolas, and pass beyond the Kei, it is a contradiction to place troops on the open country of the"], [65, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 39 Kabousie to intercept them, and therefore I have recalled the cavalry detachment under the command of Major Tot tenham of the 12th Lancers, to King William's Town, till further orders. They will be replaced when the Gaikas shall have been expelled, and the pbject may then be to prevent their return. I have left Lieutenant-Colonel Michel at his camp in the Leneah Valley, which is to the right of Fort Cox, and more immediately commands the western side of the Amatola coun try, in the direction of Mount Macdonald; but I have caused Lieutenant-Colonel Perceval of the 12th Regiment, to move with his detachment from his camp on the Quilli Quilli River to the southward, following the course of the Keiskamma, passing through the country of the Chiefs Stock and Seyolo, now infested by banditti, and, crossing that and the Fish River, return to his former quarters at Botha's Hill, on the right bank of the Fish River, covering Graham's Town. General Somerset has come into King William's Town from the neighbourhood of the Windvogel-berg, with a small escort, for the purpose of communicating with me, having passed across the open country to the eastward of the Amatolas. By all accounts which I have received there can be no doubt that the Kroome Range, in which the Waterkloof is situated, and which is only about twelve miles from Fort Beaufort within the colony, is again occupied by Macomo and his followers, associated with rebel Hottentots; and it is likely that other desperate characters may seek for shelter in this stronghold, to the terror and annoyance of neighbouring* farmers. I therefore intend to carry out the measure which I had long since formed, founded on the information of which I was already in posses sion, and in which Sir Harry Smith entirely concurred, that of occupying two or three posts connected with each other, and one in force at Bear's Farm with the Rifle Brigade and some cavalry, from whence, surrounding the place, they can command"], [66, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 40 the egress and ingress of parties in search of plunder, and starve and harass them ; but I have instructed Colonel Buller to abstain from any great battle till further orders, but to trust to opportunities for constant annoyance, which must render it in the end impossible for the -.rebels to continue to harbour there ; and when I arrive at Fort Beaufort I will take an early opportunity of reconnoitring the locality, with the view to a final ejectment, and the establishment of a central permanent post, which, with the gradual opening out of roads and com munications, will, I trust, provide sufficiently for its future security. The Fish River, near its junction with the Kat River, where it intercepts the road between Graham's Town and Fort Beaufort, and in its whole course from thence to its mouth, is described to me as bordered by rocky hills and kloofs, comprised within a belt of thick bush several miles in breadth. Across this continuous belt of forest various roads traverse, crossing the river by fords. These form passes in which lawless people of every description, whether Kafirs or rebel Hottentots, may waylay passengers with facility. I am glad to hear, however, that the Chiefs Stock and Seyolo, with their remnants of tribes, have ceased to harbour there ; and that, although there is no doubt many lawless banditti will infest these woods and live on plunder, there is no large body at present which would require a military operation to dislodge it. I hope to provide for the security of those neigh bourhoods and passages through the several fords and defiles by means of a better organisation of police, adequate rewards for the apprehension of marauders, and summary justice on those who may be taken in the commission of this lawless offence. It is my intention, as soon as I have closed my despatches for the next mail, and made the necessary arrangements with Colonel Mackinnon for carrying out my views with respect to civil matters in Kaffraria, to proceed to visit the Amatolas, and"], [67, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 41 continue my route by Fort Hare to Fort Beaufort, where I shall establish my head-quarters for some time. Those views may be summed up under four principal heads : 1st. That of the expulsion of the rebellious tribes from their former territo ries, which I consider forfeited by rebellion ; 2ndly. On the other hand, conciliation and reward for those who have re mained friendly during the contest ; 3rdly. As regards Umhala, whose conduct, though he has paid the fines imposed upon him, and obtained a complete reconciliation with my prede cessor the day before his departure, appears to be still in bad repute, and suspected by Commissioner Major Hogge, Colonel Mackinnon, and Captain Maclean, of at least sympathising with, if not aiding and abetting, the rebellious party, I have desired that no unnecessary severe demands should be made upon him, in case it should be proved that some of the dis membered branches of Sandilli's tribe, when ejected from their former locality, should find their way with their cows to seek an asylum with relatives they may have in Umhala's tribe, and not by measures of unnecessary harshness provoke resistance, which would compel me to commence a new war against that tribe at all, if it can be properly avoided, certainly not at pre sent, as I have enough on my hands without it, and Umhala's country is one which is open, and easily managed at any time ; 4thly. With regard also to the alleged harbouring of Gaika cattle by Chief Kreili, beyond the Kei, whom we do not recog nise as Her Majesty's subject, but an independent neighbouring chief under subjection, it appears to me that enough has been done to punish and humiliate him for what offences he may have committed or connived at, or been really unable to pre vent; and as the Gaikas are sentenced to pass beyond the Kei, and abandon their former locations, I see no cause to object to their carrying the small remnant of their stock and milch cows with them, nor can I object to Kreili's allowing them to pass through his territory, for it is unavoidable ; his"], [68, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 42 own interest is sufficient security for their not being allowed to remain on the Kei, and they must go further in search of new location, which it is generally reported to me they will have no difficulty in finding. In the meantime I have appointed Major-General Yorke to the command of the troops to the eastward of the Keiskamma, which district comprises British Kaffraria, and which command forms the 2nd Division. Major-General Somerset, whom I find in command of the 1st Division, left this on his return to Fort Beaufort, across the sources of the Kabousie, and through the country to the northward of the Amatolas, leaving the Windvogel-berg to the right, and on arriving at Fort Beaufort I have directed him to take measures for the occupation of the Kroome Range or Waterkloof country by the Rifle Brigade, &\u00ab., as above stated. I find that, in consequence of the active and successful military operations which have been carried on under the orders of my predecessor, the troops are at present very much in want of time to repose and to refit, and, therefore, I am glad to think that what has already been done by them may possibly be so turned to account by passive occupation that the war may be brought to a satisfactory conclusion with but little more fatigue and loss on the part of the troops. Should, how ever, this not prove to be the case, a short repose will render the force under my command more able to start with renewed vigour and effect upon a fresh campaign; and, working out wards from a military base placed within the colony, I should hope to make good and maintain the objects essential to the protection of the frontier until other arrangements can be made to fill up the locations from which the contumacious tribes in British Kaffraria must be expelled, and thereby, as far and as soon as may be practicable, diminish the necessity for military occupation, which in the meantime is, I believe, the only"], [69, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 43 resource that can, under existing circumstances, be relied upon. I have, &c, (Signed) Geo. Cathcart, Lieutenant-General, Governor and Commander-in-Chief. The Right Hon. Earl Grey, &c. &c. Copy of a Despatch from Lieut.-General the Hon. G. Cathcart to Earl Grey. King William's Town, April 20, 1852. My Lord, \u2014 Although it is necessary, in my military de spatch of this date, after reporting the state of things as I find them, to point out the line of conduct I have decided to pur sue for the prosecution, and, I hope, speedy conclusion, of this war, I have confined that despatch to matters upon which I must decide and act at once. But there are others of no less importance, which I have under consideration, which, as they relate to ulterior arrange ments for securing the advantages that may be gained from this war, and guarding against the recurrence of a similar cala mity, admit of deliberation ; and, therefore, I submit them to your Lordship, not as plans yet matured in their details, but which I believe to be just in principle, and well suited to the exigencies of the case. Reason and experience prove that the expulsion of warlike hostile neighbours from locations which are mountainous, and replete with natural strongholds, can lead to no real benefit, unless those locations be occupied, and the possession of them permanently held when gained; for the moment they are left unguarded or unoccupied, the expelled tribes will return and reoccupy them, with increased power of tenacity derived from experience in war. Therefore, I have, in continuation of the policy adopted by"], [70, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 44 my predecessor, and which I consider amply justified on the grounds declared in my Proclamation to the obedient and friendly chiefs, made known my fixed and immutable purpose of expelling the contumacious Chief Sandilli and all his asso ciates in rebellion from their former locations, and across the Kei. When this is accomplished, which it must be effectually, the question will arise as to occupation, with a view to keeping permanent possession of those vacated localities. I do not now refer to troubled places within the colonial boundary, which must also, and, I think, may easily, be ad justed, but to localities to be vacated in British Kaffraria. These may be divided into three contiguous districts, each of which is peculiar as to its circumstances, and, therefore, I think, requires a peculiar arrangement for its efficient occu pation. Military occupation in the first instance is, of course, the only resource in every case ; but, as that expedient, if on a scale adequate to the purpose, is far too costly for conti nuance, and even then must prove barren as to advantage to be derived from the possession of a colony, \u2014 I am consulting and considering with all care and diligence as to such measures as may gradually be made to supply the place of actual military occupation, with some prospect of progressive improvement, and which may ultimately render them at least self-supporting, if not remunerative. The three locations to which I allude are, \u2014 first in import ance, that which was allotted by my predecessor to the Chief Sandilli as his portion of the Gaika territory, in which is in cluded the well-known stronghold called the Amatola country, which has been so frequently invaded and abandoned after much trouble and loss of life in this and former wars, and with no permanent benefit. This peculiar geographical accident of country, of no small military importance in Kaffrarian warfare, is a circular barrier"], [71, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 45 of hills of no great elevation, but sufficiently prominent, in a tract of country otherwise comparatively open, to be called mountains. The principal range of hills form a circular bar rier of about forty miles in circumference, and consequently some thirteen or fourteen in diameter. From this outward circular ridge numerous spurs branch inward toward the centre, and form in many places deep and precipitous ravines or kloofs, which, being densely wooded, afford the formidable natural fastnesses in which the Kafirs harbour when assailed. From the head of these ravines numerous streams, sources of the Keiskamma River, take their rise, and as they concen trate in a hollow called the Keiskamma Hoek, pass through valleys described as possessing considerable fertility ; the tops of the hills and spurs are also generally clear of wood, or studded with small patches, which give the country a park like appearance. Outside of this hilly region, and to the eastward, but bounded on the north side by a ridge of hills, a spur from the Amatolas called the Kabousie Range, there is an extent of some fifteen miles by ten of pasture land, where the river Ka bousie, an important tributary to the Kei, receives its source. This is plain open grass land, only slightly undulated, and to the southward some equally good pasture land brings the verge of this territory, heretobefore belonging to the tribe of San dilli, within a few miles of this place. I am thus particular in describing this locality as it is that in which I should propose the experiment of locating a mili tary population of Swiss emigrants, formed in the first instance of two regiments of 700 or 800 men each, with a view to ulti mate colonisation, according to a scheme which is already under your Lordship's consideration, and based on a system somewhat analogous to that of the enrolled pensioners in New Zealand. British military pensioners in this colony have not been found to thrive, possibly owing to their unsteadiness and want of combination ; whereas, a national colony of people,"], [72, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 46 who proverbially cling together, and are thrifty, as well as ex pert marksmen, and accustomed to mountain districts, when organised in villages, would, I firmly believe, be able, with due assistance and support at starting, to keep their own after wards, and thrive. Their almost immediate contact with this place, and the easy communication from hence with the port of East London, would open to them a market, and ensure supplies ; and such people, unconnected with politics and pre judices, which distract the mixed community within the colony, would, as the loyal garrison of a great central citadel, control and secure the whole of British Kaffraria, and supply the place of several regiments which must be otherwise re quired for its occupation. I have mooted this subject in private conversation with several talented and experienced persons, both civil and mili tary, including my predecessor in command, my Assistant Commissioner Major Hogge, Commissioner Mackinnon, and two members of the Legislative Council, who are deeply in terested, as well as experienced in the affairs of the eastern frontier, and all of them appear to think well of this project, and, if practicable, none have stated any difficulty or objection to it. Secondly. There is to the northward of the Amatolas an extensive tract of country comprised between the Klip-plaat and Great Kei Rivers, in the centre of which is situated the mountain called the Windvogel-berg. The district is re ported to me to be, generally speaking, open, and well calcu lated for cattle pasturage. This country was considered to be allotted to the Tambookies of the tribe of Mapassa, but they have proved totally insufficient for its due occupation, and their participation in the rebellion, as well as this country having been made in parts a refuge for Gaika cattle, are con siderations which remove any claim there may have been to exclusive possession ; and I am in hopes that a better arrange ment may be made, now that an improved understanding with"], [73, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 47 the Boers appears to have been so successfully brought about by the judicious management of my Assistant Commissioners, Major Hogge and Mr. Owen, and I have with that view di rected Major Hogge, who is shortly about to return to the Sovereignty, to obtain more certain information as to the prac ticability and the means of inducing settlers of Dutch origin to return and occupy this district in sufficient numbers to be capable of mutual support and self-defence. Thirdly. There remains a tract of country, hitherto the con tiguous locations of the Chiefs Seyolo and Stock, who have been most inveterate in their participation in this war against Her Majesty's authority. Those locations may be described as together forming a triangle, having its apex near to this place, and its base on the Keiskamma between Line Drift and near to Fort Hare. These chiefs and the remnants of their rebellious tribes, which are but insignificant in numbers, are under the ban of expulsion beyond the Kei ; and it is necessary, as soon as I may have secured more important and immediate objects, to occupy this country, in the first instance by military posts, and then will arise the question as to what chief and people I may subsequently find it expedient and practicable to place there in permanent occupation. My thoughts and inquiries are di rected to the Chief Kama, who is the only Kafir whom I can find is confidently believed to have become a true convert to Christianity. This chief, with his tribe, have been most faith ful throughout these trying times; and should he desire a change of location, he being at present in possession of terri tory in Upper Albert, within the colonial boundary, that change might be attended with beneficial results. This must, however, depend entirely upon his own free will. Failing that arrangement, the Fingoes, who were brought from Butterworth at the time of the last expedition across the Kei, and who are now dwelling in the neighbourhood of the Fingoe settlement, near Fort Peddie, might possibly be made available."], [74, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 48 But of the above arrangements, that of the proposal respect ing two Swiss regiments for the occupation of the Amatola country is the only one which I offer to your Lordship with confidence as to its expediency and practicability ; and I do so in the hope, if to your Lordship's better judgment it should appear in the same light, no delay should arise from any sup posed doubts or hesitation on my part. With regard to the other two, I offer them merely as the only expedients which have as yet been suggested applicable to the occasion, but concerning which it would be premature in me to form any fixed opinion. They will suffice, however, to indicate to your Lordship the line of policy which it is my intention steadily to work out, with a view to a speedy and lasting termination of the war. I have, &c, Geo. Cathcart, Lieutenant-General, Governor and Commander-in-Chief. The Right Hon. Earl Grey, &c. &c. Copy of a Despatch from Governor Lieut.-General the Hon. G. Cathcart to the Right Hon. Sir John S.

Sir, \u2014 Trusting to Lieutenant-Governor Darling, who is con stantly in communication with me, arfd whose views and opinions are entirely in accordance with mine, to give you all necessary information respecting the general state of the settle ment of the Cape of Good Hope, and those details of business which centre in the established seat of Government, I will con fine myself more particularly in my reports by this post to the affairs of the several remote districts of the extensive govern ment and command committed to my charge which are at pre sent more immediately under my personal observation and control. In doing so the peculiar and totally distinct circumstances in"], [75, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 49 respect to matters of policy which belong to the three principal districts concerning which I have to report, require that I should break my subjects into three separate despatches on matters of policy, and an additional one for military operations and the progress of the war. I will confine this despatch, therefore, to the eastern parts of the colony of the Cape now under martial law ; my second, to the affairs of the heterogeneous communi ties which constitute the Orange River sovereignty, and poli tical relations with the Trans-Vaal emigrant Boers ; and third, as to that most interesting and fertile district of country be tween the Keiskamma and the Kei, inhabited exclusively by aborigines, with the exception of certain posts for military purposes, known as British Kaffraria, which is also a sove reignty, and distinct from, and incapable, under existing cir cumstances, of amalgamation with, the colony of the Cape of Good Hope. With regard to the affairs of these eastern districts of the colony, the necessity for taking over the command from my predecessor at King William's Town, and the affairs, both mili tary and political, of British Kaffraria, detained me one month in that quarter, and only allowed me to remove my head-quar ters to this place within the colonial boundary last week. It is only since then that I have been able to form any just opinion of the real state of things ; for whilst at King William's Town the circuitous, uncertain, and sometimes intercepted postal communication, only conducted through the intervention of friendly Kafirs, kept me much in the dark. I regret to say I find on my arrival here these districts, as to farms and stock, and even the communications from place to place, in the same insecure state in which they have been, with out intermission, since the commencement of the war, and dependent entirely upon the costly and harassing exertion of military force for the very imperfect protection they as yet enjoy. Whilst in British Kaffraria there is one principal chief with E"], [76, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 50 a single and united great clan to contend with, in these dis tricts the numerous strongholds afforded by dense forests and deep ravines which border the Keiskamma and Fish Rivers, and the vast natural fastness formed by the numerous deep preci pitous and densely-wooded ravines which radiate from the cen tral summit of the Kroome Mountain, furnish almost inacces sible dens and lurking places for large bands of lawless, well armed, and desperate marauders, the most formidable of which consist of vagrant Tambookies and rebel Hottentots ; but be sider them, the Kafir Chief Macomo, who claims the Kroome range as his property, is still with his people in occupation of the Waterkloof and Fuller's Hoek ; and Seyolo is as yet in undisturbed possession of his wooded kloofs on the Keiskamma, near Line Drift, which direct passage between Graham's Town and King William's Town he has held closed for the last fifteen months. So active and enterprising are these marauders, that it is not safe to ride two miles from this place without arms, and in sufficient numbers to afford mutual support ; and no one can travel, except at great risk, without an escort, from hence to Graham's Town. In order to improve this state of things, and to separate duties of internal police, having in view protection of lives and property, from the military duties which call for employment of disciplined soldiers against an enemy in the field, and effectual support to the civil power when necessary, I have already pre pared since my arrival here a draft of a General Order, a copy of which is enclosed, for the formation of a powerful mounted police, to be at the disposal of the civil commissioners of the disturbed districts, to patrol roads and intercept marauders, as well as to protect property ; and if the right men can be ob tained, of which I have little doubt, if they be vigilant, under stand their duty, and be properly made use of, I have every reason to hope, that by giving alarm, and calling upon neigh bouring farmers, both of Dutch and British origin, who are all armed and mounted, and willing and ready, a sufficient internal"], [77, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 51 protection may be obtained, without frequent call for military aid, and the necessity for numerous detachments. This organisation will, if it succeeds, enable me gradually to dispense with numerous levies of a most expensive and ineffi cient description, being half military and half civil, mixed and scattered through the country, and entirely out of control, yet having claims for bounty, clothing, rations for themselves and families, loss of horses, shoeing, saddlery, and numerous other small charges, for which, being bargains on enlistment, and resting on General Orders and precedent of my predecessor, when vouched for by the civil commissioners, who have them selves but little knowledge or control, there is seldom any course open to me but to give my warrant for payment. But here I beg to observe, that although I cannot avoid pointing out existing inconveniences in their full force, in order to show the object and necessity for measures by which I pro pose to remove them, I do not impute any blame to my prede cessor for their existence, for the state of things I have described arose out of sudden emergencies and unavoidable necessity, and I have no doubt, when time would allow it, he would have adopted the same, or, possibly, better measures with the same view. By the system of contract which I propose with the man for his services, his horse, food, raiment, forage, lodging, in short, everything, , without any opening foi after claims of any sort. Although the daily rate of pay 01 wages may appear high, it will not prove expensive in the end. But I have another most important consideration in view in the establishment of this local police force for purely local pur poses of protection and security of lives and property ; that is, that when once duly organised, and its benefits felt, as I have reason to hope they will, it may be easily transferred to the entire management and maintenance of the civil government, to which it properly belongs, and may be a permanent means of obliging those who live in more favoured districts to contri- E 2"], [78, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 52 bute more adequately to the protection of their less fortunate fellow-colonists. I have sent copies of Ihe draft of my proposed General Order to the several civil commissioners, to ask for further sug gestions and opinions on the subject ; and all those civil com missioners, field cornets, and others with whom I have had as yet an opportunity of conversing on the subject, seem to approve entirely, and desire the measure. The removal of my stationary head-quarters to this place, which has for its object the more convenient base, both in a military and civil point of view, from whence I can superintend all the important frontier concerns which require my immediate attention, with equal advantage, has been duly appreciated by the inhabitants of the districts within the colony ; and I have received, within a few days after my arrival, several deputations of burghers, as well as settlers of British origin, many from great distances, who came to hail my coming amongst them, and to lay their grievances and requirements respectfully before me. We met cordially, and I listened attentively to all they had to say, carrying on the dialogue with those of Dutch origin through the medium of a very good interpreter ; and I have reason to think,\u2014 although in answer to many points adduced I could only answer, that a parliament being about to be esta blished, I could make no new laws by my own ordinance to meet their requirements, and that they would henceforward have a great share in legislating for themselves, \u2014 I would use all my influence in support of those measures which would be, in my opinion, conducive to their benefit. I have reason to think that they are convinced of the truth that my coming here at all is only with a view to doing my best for their benefit. With regard to the Kat River settlement, and the investiga tion of that subject, I must wait for the return of my two Assistant Commissioners (with whom I think of associating Mr. Calderwood, civil commissioner at Alice) from their mis sion to the Sovereignty. The death of the old Mr. Read, the"], [79, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 53 missionary, which has occurred within these few days, has, I am told, rather favoured the prospects of a satisfactory investi gation, by liberating testimony which otherwise might not have been freely given. But of the truth of this I can form no opinion, and I avoid in any manner prejudging the question. I will not further lengthen this despatch respecting the affairs of the frontier districts within the colony, as my personal ob servation extends to little more than one week; and I will reserve my report on numerous other topics, concerning which I have not yet had time to form a confirmed opinion, till the next opportunity. I have, &c, (Signed) Geo. Cathcart, Lieut.-General, Governor and Commander-in-Chief. The Bight Hon. Sir John S. Pakington, Bart. Copy of a Despatch from Lieut.-General the Hon. G. Cathcart to the Right Hon. Sir John S. Pakington, Bart Fort Beaufort, May 20, 1 852. Sir, \u2014 From the circumstance of my relief of my predecessor happening to take place at King William's Town, my first per sonal observation was directed to the district of British Kaf fraria, comprised between the Keiskamma and Kei Rivers. Another despatch will more particularly report the military circumstances connected with this country, in which the war commenced, and has not yet been brought to a termination ; and I propose to devote this more particularly to the political state of things within it, and the great value and capabili ties which I believe it to possess, as well as some measures which I consider of immediate interest in order to provide for the maintenance of peace when the war may be brought to a close. I find that this comparatively small district of country"], [80, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 54 is perhaps more favoured by nature in respect to fertility, abundance of water, and capability of improvement, than any other part of Her Majesty's colonial possessions in South Africa. It possesses also a seaport at the mouth of the Buffalo River (East London), which, though far from being a good one, is the best on the extensive line of coast comprised be tween Natal and Simon's Bay, and which has proved perfectly efficient for commissariat purposes, and the landing of troops and horses, without an accident, during this war, and is capable of improvement ; and, as I think, this port may, I would almost say must, become in due course of time one of the principal commercial outlets, not only of this district itself, but of those beyond the Orange River. The acquirement of this territory, as you are aware, was a measure of policy originally considered under the government of the late Sir Benjamin D'Urban, and the object seems to have been the establishment of a better frontier to the colony, by an extension of territory to the river Kei. I will not attempt to discuss the various opinions on the merits of this question. My own opinion as to the abstract view of a choice of a defensible frontier is, that in the existing state of things the advantage that may be gained from the removal of Her Majesty's dominions from the Keiskamma to the Kei, is, that future border forays and depredations may, so long as colonists of European origin are, as at present, debarred from promiscuous settlement among the natives in this district, take place between Kafir and Kafir, instead of between Kafir and colonist, which is a preferable state of things, and more easily managed. Generally speaking, when a territory is extended, the new frontier may for a time prove more easily defensible ; but the increased distances for commissariat sup plies, and the greater extent of front which expansion exposes, are inconveniences which are apt to neutralise that benefit. In the case, however, of British Kaffraria, I am inclined to think that, from the accidental circumstance of the great capabilities"], [81, "CORKESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 55 of the country acquired, its own resources may, if properly managed, ultimately prove more than a compensation for the usual inconveniences of extension of territory. This tract of country, as you are aware, is inhabited by clans of a remarkable race called Kafirs, each clan having a chief, who is assisted in governing by a council, and owning a certain por tion of territory within defined limits. These hereditary chiefs are, with but one exception, all descendants from the same patriarchal or royal progenitor, and they are all, therefore, related; but as their traditions do not extend back beyond three generations, and appear to centre in one common origin at that day, there is little doubt they came from some* distant country, and obtained possession of their present territory by right of conquest, under a chief whose name is supposed to have been Kosa, as they call themselves Amakosa, the prefix Ama constituting the plural, and the designation Kafir is an Arabic nickname, signifying infidel, and not in use in their own language. The present paramount chief of the whole race is Kreili, who resides on the farther side of the Kei, and, therefore, not being Her Majesty's subject, our relations with him are of a diplo matic character. We are still at war with him, my predecessor having invaded his territory to punish him for aiding and abetting the rebel Chief Sandilli ; but though he has not com plied with the terms dictated by Sir Harry Smith, he has not openly interfered, as far as I can find, iu the contest since my arrival. A copy of a message I have recently sent him is enclosed; and I did not send it till I had satisfied |myself I could enforce the threat it contains. The measure to which it alludes would be more effectual than another expedition of Her Majesty's troops across the Kei, and save the enormous expense of wear and tear. By a certain declaration or oath made before my predecessor as High Commissioner, of which they recognise the validity, they hold themselves bound in allegiance to Her Majesty; and"], [82, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 56 injustice it must be admitted that this remarkable people have a strong sense of the moral obligation of good faith, and if they enter into any engagement at all are seldom found to promise one thing and do another. This territory being beyond the colonial border, and having been found exclusively in possession of, and inhabited by, one race of people, though divided into clans, and under a sort of feudal organisation, having peculiar usages, some objectionable and absurd, but others of sufficient efficacy to place the powers of government and rude justice in the hands of the chief and his amapakati, or counsellors, it was, I think, judiciously arranged that this new acquisition to Her Majesty's possessions should not be annexed to the colony for the present, or any attempt made to subject it to colonial laws; and that no settle ment of colonists of European race should be allowed to esta blish themselves, but that under British sovereign rule the chiefs should govern their respective clans with as little inter ference as might be consistent with the general interests of the newly-constituted Sovereignty, and with a due regard to the main object of its acquisition, viz. a medium under British control to be interposed between the colony and the less ma nageable, because independent, tribes beyond the limits of Her Majesty's dominions. Therefore, since no statutes or laws can be made applicable to so rude a state of society, until civilisation shall gradually work its way amongst them, martial law, by which I under stand arbitrary power entrusted to an officer in chief command, for the just exercise of which he is, however, responsible, is the only institution applicable to the purpose of its supreme government. This, I believe, to have been the theory of the measure of annexation. So fully do I recognise the wisdom of this original theory, that my own line of conduct, now that the responsibility has devolved on me, will be entirely based upon it; and this course appears to be in accordance with the spirit of my instructions."], [83, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 57 As there are so many confused and contradictory versions of the history and state of society of this people now current, I have thought it indispensable to make you acquainted with that which, from personal investigation, I believe to be the correct one, and which must at all events govern my policy in respect to'it, as far as it rests on my own responsibility in this portion of my extensive trust. I am inclined to think that some inadvertent or injudicious cases of departure from the theory of government I have adverted to have furnished useful lessons by their results, to warn and guide me back into a steady course of policy suited to the present circumstances ; and I have guarded against any premature interference with or disparagement of the autho rity and influence of chiefs in respect to the government of their clans, because I am convinced that to remove one means of governing before you can possibly supply its place by another can only be productive of anarchy ; whereas, if the chief be supported in the government of his clan, it is easy to govern the chief and his people through him. The present war commenced with the deposition of the chief of the Gaika branch of the Amakosa family, or Kafir people. His immediate relations and sub-chiefs, with their followers, have adhered, and still adhere religiously, to his cause. It is unnecessary for me to enter into the casus belli; but the rebellion and guilt of the Gaika chiefs and their followers are established by their harbouring and associating with de serters and rebellious Hottentots, and causing much expense of blood and money in the prosecution of their rebellion ; and as they are a peculiarly warlike and restless race, the future peace of the community demands their permanent expulsion from the strongholds which they have hitherto possessed in the Amatola Mountains, and which have proved the citadel which effectually commands all the surrounding districts of country which lie at their base. I am now in permanent pos-"], [84, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 58 session of more than two-thirds of this natural citadel, and hope soon to effect the expulsion of the chief and his followers, who still occupy the north-western corner, into which they have retired, and then take means for its permanent and com plete occupation. The enterprising and warlike sub-chief Seyolo,' who still inhabits his own small territory on the Keiskamma, who com mands as yet the passage of that river by Line Drift, and who has as yet been but little molested, must then be dealt with ; but I am taking previous measures for the permanent occupa tion of his territory by the establishment of a post on the Temacha River, which will in a great degree command it, before I resort to means of ejectment; for such measures are worse than useless, unless some effectual and permanent result can be expected from them. The T'Slambie branches of the great Amakosa family, who inhabit the whole sea-board of British Kaffraria, and one who borders on the Kei, have fortunately remained faithful to their allegiance throughout the war. Their fidelity is mainly to be attributed to the excellent management 'and personal influence of the T'Slambie Commissioner, Captain Maclean, whom I cannot too strongly recommend to your favourable notice ; for, but for this circumstance, the whole territory must at the first outbreak have been abandoned. I have taken measures, which will be sufficiently explained by some enclosures in this despatch, to confirm and establish this most essential good understanding ; and I have reason to believe they have been attended with success ; but if the great natural citadel of the Amatolas be secured, the other countries are much more manageable, and a comparatively small force, with a proportion of cavalry, concentrated at King William's Town, would effectually control them. I come now to the important consideration of what is to be done ultimately for the permanent occupation of this territory ;"], [85, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 59 and this question, from what I have already said, I think will appear to centre in the permanent occupation of the Amatola district. I am not called upon in my instructions to report prospec tively on this head till after the present war shall have been brought to an end, and it might be considered premature my attempting to do so now; but since, after the most careful consideration on the spot, as the measures I am about to advert to require consideration, and if conceived practicable and expe dient would take time in preparation for carrying them into effect, I think it right to lose none in submitting them. It is evident that the forcible ejectment of a powerful and warlike people from a country to which they are attached, of which they well know the great value in respect to its own natural resources, and the great influence it gives to the posses sors over all surrounding districts, can only be rendered perma nent by the occupation of it by some superior power. This can be, and nearly is at this time, accomplished by military occupation; but not less than 3000 regular troops, with certainty of further military support in case of emergency, could hold it so as to keep the old possessors out of it, and prevent perpetual attempts for its recovery, at least for many years to come ; so that this would imply a permanent military force of at least 5000 men for the security of British Kaffraria, exclusive of what might be required in the eastern district of the colony. Occupation, therefore, by colonists, under some sufficient military organisation for mutual defence, with a comparatively small regular force of Her Majesty's troops for their support, appeared to me as worthy of consideration. British military pensioners have been tried in this country, have proved a failure, and in two out of three villages which were established close to the border nearly all the male inha bitants were murdered at the opening of this war. Although I am inclined to think the precaution of establishing some"], [86, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 60 rallying post in the midst of each of these villages might have effectually prevented that calamity, the intemperate and idle habits of too many of the class of British military pensioners, and a natural carelessness and contempt of danger, would render them unfit to be placed with safety in an Alpine district, the nature of which renders constant vigilance peculiarly essen tial to security. Ordinary settlers could not be brought together in villages and compact communities, or collected simultaneously in suffi cient number to form a settlement, neither could they be made amenable to the control and restraints essential to their own interests. To place a concentrated population of the now dispersed race of Fingoes there is another expedient that has occurred to me. This people, who at present live in separate tribes, and have been scattered in distinct and separate locations, in order to avoid the danger of a powerful and united nation within the colony, have behaved always faithfully, and often nobly, as armed levies in aid of Her Majesty's troops in this war. Their location in the Amatolas, under long-continued and powerful military support from Her Majesty's regular troops, might be practicable. But, should that support be withdrawn, or even reduced beyond a certain point, a war between the Fingoes and the Kafirs would immediately take place, in which the more powerful and warlike race of Kafirs, uniting in one common cause of national hostility, would be almost certain to prevail against the Fingoes, and be likely to involve the British nation in a war which would probably be more formidable and difficult to deal with than the present one; besides which, even should the Fingoes be able to maintain themselves, and fill the magnificent pastures of the Amatola districts with their cattle, they would be totally unproductive. The Fingoes, as indeed do the Kafirs, keep enormous herds of cattle for no use whatever. They very rarely kill any for food ; they make no trade in hides, and they will not even sell"], [87, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 61 an ox ; but their object of pride is to possess the largest quan tity of cattle, which they count and gloat upon as a miser does on his hoarded treasure. Another expedient, however, suggested itself to me by acci dent, previously to my leaving England, and though I had not time to consider it then, and had not the advantage of local observation which I now possess, appeared to me to be so well worthy of consideration that I submitted it privately to Earl Grey, who also was of opinion that it merited conside ration . This was a project for raising two Swiss rifle regiments of 700, or, 1 should say, 1000 men each, with a view to colonisa tion after the war is ended ; a sort of military organisation for mutual support and defence. I will not add unnecessarily to the length of this despatch, which is already longer than I could wish, by entering into details of this project, for no doubt the only information I possess as to the feasibility of the plan, copies of which I gave to Earl Grey, are to be found in the Colonial Office. I, however, enclose a copy of a memorandum I gave to his Lordship on this subject, in case the original should have been mislaid. From what I have seen, the country is so analogous to Switzerland, and so capable of feeding sheep as well as cattle on the most luxuriant pastures, and abounding with the finest water, I am convinced that such a colony, if it could be formed, would not only flourish and maintain itself, but prove the means of rendering this territory ultimately remunerative, in stead of a burden to the British nation, and serve at little expense as a secure barrier for the protection of this portion of the extensive frontier of Her Majesty's South African dominion. I enclose a printed copy of a Proclamation which I gave on assuming the responsibility of the government of British Kaf fraria under martial law, the heading of which is new, and contains some provisions I have made for the more convenient"], [88, "62 THE HON.

Copy of a Despatch from Governor Lieut.-General the Hon. G. Cathcart to the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Fort Beaufort, May 20, 1852. Sir, \u2014 Since my last report, the principal military circum stances worthy of remark are, that I have adhered steadily to the system I then announced \u2014 that of keeping possession of the Amatolas, and allowing the troops time to recover their energies ; and I have also taken measures with a view to re opening the direct communication between King William's Town and Graham's Town, which has been closed for the last sixteen months, and remains still for the present impassable without some pioneering and a large escort. F"], [92, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 66 With regard to the Amatolas \u2014 which comprise a district of most fertile and valuable country, enclosed by a precipitous mountain barrier of great elevation, some 80 miles in circum ference, into which there are but few practicable passes \u2014 I have recently patrolled personally all through it, and visited the two stationary camps of Colonels Michel and Eyre. These most efficient officers, each of whom have about 1000 men of regular infantry, and their proportion of Fingoes and other levies, with a detachment of cavalry, and two guns, have com plete command of more than two- thirds of this mountain dis trict; so that as every Kafir field of Indian corn or garden has been destroyed, and not a single head of cattle can appear on the pastures with impunity, the Kafirs have abandoned those parts as a habitation, though they still haunt the woods and kloofs in small numbers, to watch the issue of events, hoping, no doubt, that I may relent. But I have every reason to be lieve that the Chief Sandilli, with his adherents, is still in possession of the north-western extremity of the district, and I have not yet the means of dislodging him, or time for it; and to do so without providing for subsequent occupation would be labour lost. This, however, if he does not migrate in the meantime, which I think he will, I feel quite certain of being able to provide for satisfactorily in due time. I have caused a tower to be built in the centre of Colonel Eyre's camp, which is in the midst of the Amatolas. I am anxious to explain the nature of this tower, its cost, and its object; for there appear to have been, at some time or other, some most costly and useless martello towers built as tele graph stations, and what not, about this country, which, with out explanation, might lead to the misapprehension that my system of tower has any analogy to those which have proved costly failures, and are unoccupied. The tower which I have caused to be built in the centre of the Amatolas, on a most favourable site, is of stone found on the spot, rubble work, 15 feet square, and two stories high,"], [93, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 67 with a flat roof to carry a gun ; the cost will not exceed \u00a3'300. The object is that for which church towers were originally, no doubt, intended in early stages of society, where a more civi lised race planted themselves among aborigines, viz. a rallying point from whence a very few men, possessed of superior pro jectile weapons, might command a radius, within which the community, and even their cattle, might take shelter when suddenly beset by swarms of savages. Had such a precaution been adopted in the military villages, the massacres which were perpetrated at the commencement of this war could not have taken place. But in the erection of this tower in the centre of the Ama tolas (which I propose to call Castle Eyre), I have in con templation not only an unmistakeable manifestation of an in tention of permanent occupation, but a prospective citadel, or central point of some future town of military organised settlers, capable of maintaining their position ; and in the meantime, it will enable me to call upon Colonel Eyre for a three or four days' expedition, in greater force than he could venture with out this nucleus for the protection of his camp during his ab sence. I have ordered a similar tower to be built, and a strong post established, at about twelve miles from King William's Town, and six from Line Drift, which drift is the ford across the Keis kamma, in the direct road to Graham's Town. This post will be near the source of the River Temacha. The object of this is to command the country of the Chief Seyolo, who is there now in full force, and perhaps the most warlike and active ad herent to the cause of Sandilli. He has never yet been seriously molested, resides with no inconsiderable clan within twenty miles of King William's Town, and commands the direct com munication with the colony. As soon as I have by this means, and by certain diplomatic arrangements with a friendly chief, provided for the permanent occupation of his territory, I will proceed to eject him ; but without this precaution, with a view f 2"], [94, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 68 to occupation, an expedition against him, however successful, would be productive of no permanent or advantageous results. With the exception of the contumacious Gaika tribe, headed by Sandilli, and his relations and adherents, I am on the most satisfactory and peaceable terms with all the other Kafir tribes which are included in the sovereignty of British Kaffraria. The second division of the force under my command, now in British Kaffraria, that is, to the eastward of the Keiskamma, which I have left under the orders of Major-General Yorke, is now in as good a state of military organisation as I could wish. But the first division within the colonial boundary, owing to its heterogeneous components, and the far more intricate and disturbed state of affairs, and greater natural difficulties of the country, requires much personal attention and support of the chief in command to bring it into a satisfactory state. And it is only since the recent removal of my head-quarters to this place, that I can fully appreciate the merit that is due to Major-General Somerset, when cut off almost entirely from head- quarters, in providing as well as he has done for the pro tection of these districts. There are two or three exertions which have probably still to be made before the war can be brought to a satisfactory termi nation, but I am not disposed to make them till I have se cured the means of retaining the advantages I may gain ; but should the opportunity offer, and the occasion require it, I am prepared to supply my present deficiency of force, occasioned by severe service and tbe unfortunate loss of the \"Birkenhead,\" by any temporary means in my power and at any cost, con vinced that a speedy and effectual termination of this unfortu nate war is the best economy ; at the same time, I will use every endeavour, by improved organisation, and reduction of all superfluous and uncontrollable sources of expenditure, with the aid of a Board I intend to establish, composed of the Com missary-General, the Deputy Adjutant-General, and my Mili tary Secretary, which will meet as soon as the Commissary-"], [95, "69 CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC.

Cloete, Quartermaster-General. Copy of a Despatch from Lieut.-Gen. the Hon. G. Cathcart to the Right Hon. Sir John S. Pakington, Bart. Fort Beaufort, June 21, 1852. Sir, \u2014 With regard to the political circumstances of the colony of the Cape, I do not find that any material alteration has taken place in the western districts since my last report. The return of the Ordinance granting the new constitution appears to be awaited without impatience, and all excitement on that subject seems to have for the present subsided. Leaving Lieutenant-Governor Darling to report concerning matters of routine of business, and particularly those more immediately connected with the western portion of the colony, I will confine myself in this, to a report as to the present state of the disturbed districts, and the means I have adopted with a view to establishing the foundation of a constitutional organi sation of police, which may in due time provide for the better security of the lives and property of the inhabitants within the eastern frontier, to be maintained at the cost of the colony, and supersede the necessity for a large portion of the regular troops and levies now employed in this service. Indeed, by this measure I hope that in due time, when it shall fairly have come into operation, the occasion for the em ployment of Her Majesty's troops within the colonial frontier may be reduced to two or three concentrated stations for the purpose of affording military support in urgent cases to the civil power."], [100, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 74 For the present, however, and until the new system shall be well established, I cannot, under existing circumstances, effect any immediate reduction, or dispense with the numerous small posts of troops, burghers, and levies, which I find established here ; for although the hostile Kafirs appear to be disheartened and subdued, evade open conflict, and seem to meditate migration, there are certain desperate bands who, from motives of revenge, appear determined to do as much mischief as they can before they go, and openly declare that intention. There are also bands of rebel Hottentots, amounting to some 300 or 400, associated with the Kafirs to a certain extent, or herding with them, about half of whom only are said to be armed, and one fourth mounted. These are much more mis chievous and dangerous, from their far superior progress in civilisation, natural intelligence, and their skill in horseman ship, and the use of arms ; and they are headed by very able leaders. Large bodies of troops can afford bttle security against the sudden forays of these people, but a police constantly on patrol, with knowledge equal to theirs of all the intricacies of the country, and having the power of alarming the neighbourhood and calling for assistance the moment the traces of the ma rauders are found, will materially defeat their evil purposes, and ultimately, I hope, put an end to them. I enclose a copy of the general order I have given for the formation of the police, together with certain rules and regulations for their guidance. In the constitution of this force, I have in view its transfer as soon as it may be practicable to the civil government ; but, in order to insure its prompt and immediate organisation, and in an efficient manner, I have framed it so that in its first coming into operation, and even during its transition state, I may hold it under military control, and give to its officers the powers of martial law possessed by those of any other military levies, which present circumstances render indispensable."], [101, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 75 But it is my intention to consult the Attorney-General (which I have not yet had time to do) as to the legality and expediency of giving to the commandants the powers also of justices of peace, and the practicability of investing them with the powers of commandants, as under the old commando system, formerly so popular and efficient in this country ; and in that case the lieutenants would assume the position of field cornets. Thus the advantage of a constant and permanent patrolling police, for prevention and immediate discovery and alarm, would be added to that of the power of enforcing immediate support and assistance in pursuing marauders and other offenders, and recovering stolen property, as possessed by the old commando system ; and with security against the possibility of abuse by regularly established organisation, the diary of duties performed, and the monthly report to the civil commis sioner of the district required by regulation. In fact I think these advantages cannot fail virtually to result from the immediate formation of the force under martial law and present circumstances of alarm, but some legislative enactment may perhaps be necessary to give them permanent effect. As to the expense of this establishment, it no doubt appears at first sight very costly. But it must be considered that by adopting a system of contract with the man for everything, the account with each individual is reduced to one fixed item ; and innumerable, uncontrollable, and incessant contingencies inci dental to all other modes of providing for an armed force are avoided. No increase of duty, transport, or establishment, or expense from any other cause, is thrown upon the Commissariat department ; and the only participation in the arrangement required of it is that of making monthly payments on certified pay bsts, and the warrant of the Commander of the Forces for the present, and that will cease when the police ibrce shall be"], [102, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 76 transferred to the colony, and those payments made through the civil commissioner, The new Legislature will no doubt be called upon to provide for this force, which is solely for the protection and security of the lives and properties of the inhabitants of the frontier districts, and who bear the brunt and form the barrier against barbarism for their more fortunate brethren within. Should this precaution not be maintained in an efficient manner, it is impossible for the mother country to afford sufficient military force to prevent that barrier being broken through ; and the savage who has gained the use and pos session of fire-arms, and acquired no despicable knowledge of the art of war, should he again recover his ancient strongholds of the Fish River and Zureherg, could not be dispossessed by any force and expenditure which the British Government would be justified in devoting to that purpose. I enclose a comparative statement, showing the cost of the police force according to its intended establishment, as com pared to the average pay, allowances, rations, and contingent expenses of other mounted levies of equal number, as I find them in this command, by which it will appear that the amount of expense of the two systems is nearly the same ; and there fore the simplicity of that adopted for the police sufficiently recommends it as facilitating its transfer to the colony, and de taching it hereafter from all military interference, even if other constitutional advantages which it possesses, already pointed out, did not afford sufficient justification for it. Men of the mounted levies now receiving pay, allowances, &c, will he allowed to transfer their services to the police, if individually approved by the civil commissioner ; and by this and other means I hope soon that the efficient services of the police will enable me to dispense with those of levies, and thus afford a saving of expense far more than equivalent for that of this new police. I am happy to say that this measure appears to meet with"], [103, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 77 general (indeed I may say, as far as I can learn, universal) approbation, and the zealous efforts of the civil commissioners aud others concerned in carrying it into operation, have already made considerable progress in giving it effect. I have, &c, (Signed) Geo. Cathcart, Lieut.-General, Governor and Commander-in-Chief. The Right Hon. Sir J. Pakiugton, Bart., &c. &c. Copy of a Despatch from Governor Lieutenant-General the Hon. G. Cathcart to the Right Hon. Sir John S. Pakington, Bart. Fort Beaufort, June 21, 1852. Sir, \u2014 As to the political affairs of British Kaffraria, events of some interest have occurred since my last report. The refractory and rebellious Gaika tribe, united under the supreme control of the Chief Sandilli, has been almost entirely expelled from the Amatolas, of which we are now, to a great extent, in permanent occupation, and hope to be able to pre vent their ever regaining possession, so as to profit by its pastures and resources ; but some few Kafirs still linger in its dense wooded ravines and forests. These I hope also to eject by a more complete occupation, as soon as time will admit. The majority, however, of the Gaika clans, with their re spective leaders and their paramount Chief Sandilli, have re moved into the outer and more eastern ranges of hills and forests, where they still linger, but cannot long remain ; and the movement by Major-GeDeral Yorke, which I have ordered, and is probably taking place at this moment, and which is de tailed in my military despatch, may possibly hasten their de parture to the Kei. I have no doubt the mode of operations I find myself in duty bound to adopt as the only sure means of bringing this desul torv warfare to a permanent and satisfactory -close, may appear"], [104, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 78 to casual observers slow and inglorious ; more rapid and bril liant achievements would be much more congenial to my own wishes, but would prove transitory and useless. The hostile Kafirs appear generally disheartened, and are starving ; they evade any hostilities unless forced in self-de fence to resistance, but the difficulty of the country enables them to elude our attempts to bring them to action, and it is only by occupation and temporary destruction of their pas turage, and consequent starvation, that they can be compelled to retire. They have no herds of cattle in the Amatola dis trict. The T'Slambie tribes continue faithful and prosperous, and are sensible of the advantages of peace with us. Recent occur rences have tended to strengthen their attachment to British sovereignty, and almost turn neutrabty into hostility to the rebelhous Gaikas. The arrest and indignities suffered by the Chief Toise are cordially resented by our staunch friends the Chiefs Pato, Siwani, and Umkye, who occupy the territory between the Buffalo and the Keiskamma, and between the Line Drift road and the sea. Umhala, whose territory extends along the sea board from a short distance beyond the Buffalo to the Kei, it is suspected, continues to be insincere and temporising ; but his country is easily assailed, and he dares not rebel so long as circumstances offer him no prospect of advantage by that course, which he well knows they do not at present. Nothing can be more able and satisfactory than the ma nagement of the T'Slambie Commissioner, Captain Maclean, throughout this delicate business ; but though the final answer of Sandilli has not been received, I do not anticipate any deci sive results from this quarrel, beyond a stimulating influence to the friendly clans to assist us in ordinary occasions, which has been already evinced by Siwani and his people in aiding the defence of a missionary station at Mount Coke when at tacked by Hottentot marauders, and a spirited and successful"], [105, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRAUIA, ETC. 79 recapture of the mail, which had been taken by these mis creants whilst passing through his father's territory, which was effected by the young Chief Tobai, son of Umkye, with fifteen of his followers, who voluntarily started in pursuit as soon as the fact came to his knowledge. The establishment of a sufficient military post on the Te macha River, about twelve miles from King William's Town, and seven from the Keiskamma River at Line Drift, has en abled me to reopen the direct communication between King William's Town and Graham's Town ; and whilst that measure gives important facility to commissariat arrangements, it also supersedes the necessity of employing Kafir post riders through a dangerous and circuitous route for the carnage of the mail, which has been so frequently intercepted. This military post will also, I have reason to think, since my recent patrols through the countries of the hostile Chiefs Stock and Seyolo, tend much to secure the permanent command of the country on the left hank of the Keiskamma as far as the Umdizini River, so that with a sufficient cavalry force, which I intend to station at Fort White, the remaining country between the Umdizini and the Amatolas, which I find favourable for the use of cavalry, will also be rendered untenable by the enemy for pasturage. Thus, as the remaining country south of the Temacha be longs to friendly chiefs, the whole line of frontier on the left bank of the Keiskamma from the Amatolas to the sea is, I hope, already so far secured, that its wooded kloofs or ravines, which though numerous are not formidable, can only afford temporary shelter for marauding bands, who, deprived of pas turage, will ultimately disperse, or seek some other country beyond the Kei where they may rebuild their kraals, return to their congenial habits, and possess in peace their herds of cattle, which is the chief object of their ambition. Thus the war-cry raised within these border districts will no longer have power to assemble the formidable bodies of clans-"], [106, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 80 men from surrounding kraals, which constituted the power of the enemy at the commencement of this war, and at former periods. In this manner, keeping steadily to the task, I hope to effect the permanent removal of neighbours who have hitherto proved most troublesome to the colony, to a distance from whence they can only return in small bands, which the police and modified commando system proposed to be estabbshed within the colony may suffice to deal with in detail. The views and opinions expressed in my last despatch with respect to the future occupation of the Amatolas remain un changed, although I do not fail to bear the subject constantly in mind, and endeavour to improve my knowledge of it by every means in my power. As belonging to the affairs of British Kaffraria, I have now still to notice perhaps the most important which has occurred since my last despatch. In that despatch I inclosed a copy of a message I had sent to the Chief Kreili. This neighbouring and independent chief, although his territory had been invaded by my predecessor, and much cattle taken from it, has continued to aid and abet the Gaika rebellion more actively than ever, and has never acknowledged bis submission ; be harbours numerous rebel Hottentots, who seem to exercise much influence over his coun cils, and who, if not dispersed in time, may instigate and direct much mischief against Her Majesty's territory on this side of the Kei. There is little doubt also that he is intriguing with Umhala, and that mutual sympathy and enmity towards us exists in the breasts of those two chiefs, though not openly declared by the former, and carefully veiled in dissimulation by the latter. By the voluntary deposition of a Hottentot prisoner, who recently surrendered, and who had been long one of the for midable baud of rebels under Uithaalder, who had associated with Sandilli, and who deposes as an eye-witness of the fact,"], [107, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 81 there appears to be no doubt that large supplies of gunpowder in leathern bags, somehow carried on four horses, have been repeatedly brought through Kreili's country to the Amatolas, which, as this informant heard, came from beyond the Bashee, and was believed to be purchased from the Chief Moshesh, who, as you are aware, is one of Her Majesty's most powerful subjects in the Orange River sovereignty. This may be a libel against Moshesh, and I will hope it is so ; but although most desirous of bringing this war to as speedy a conclusion as prudence and sound pobcy will permit, and most anxious to avoid an unnecessary expedition to a remote country, perma nent security demands that the bordering Chief Kreili should be humbled and subdued, that the Chief Moshesh should be made sensible of the power of the British Government by that example, and that the dangerous and growing influence of the Hottentot rebels who have found shelter in the Chief Kreili's territory should, if possible, be broken up ; in short, that the fruits of the recent invasion of my predecessor should be brought to maturity. You will have observed by my last communication on this subject, that in my message to the Chief Kreili I put forward a threat in respect to an authorised invasion of burghers. On reference to my last despatch, I am apprehensive that the mul tiplicity of other matters which occupied my attention at the moment, caused me to neglect a sufficient explanation of my views in that respect. They are as follows : \u2014 I have every reason to believe that I am on good terms with the burgher population, and I had ascertained that they are disposed to respond to my call. We have now apparently a large army in this command, but owing to its unavoidable diffusion under existing circumstances over a vast extent of country, I find a very small portion of it disposable without temporary abandonment of advantages gained. This state of things I hope, by measures adverted to in this despatch, and already in progress, shortly to amend. But even G"], [108, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 82 then, when this war may be concluded and the force reduced, as it no doubt would be, I consider it most essential to convince our neighbours that we have other powerful resources besides and in addition to Her Majesty's regular troops, sufficient to hold them in subjection; and now for that reason, since an expedition beyond the Kei has become imperative, I still intend to put forward the burgher force as the principal and active agents of merited castigation ; it is, nevertheless, my intention to support them with a regular force of three battabons, four guns, one squadron of Lancers, and one of the Cape Corps of regular troops, besides upwards of 1000 irregular troops, in all about 3000 men, which would in itself suffice for the purpose in view. And in addition to this, I have received through the agent beyond the Kei, Mr. Shaw, the assurance of the co operation of the powerful Chief Faku, who dwells beyond the Bashee River, and whose tribe is said to be in number equal to that of Kreili, who, as Her Majesty's ally, is ready and willing to enter the south-eastern portion of the territory of the Chief Kreili, and plunder his cattle to the greatest extent in his power; and as on a former similar occasion this chief had already captured 6000 head of cattle for his own use and benefit, and in Her Majesty's cause, when he was interrupted by the flood ing of the Bashee, I have no reason to doubt the efficiency of his co-operation when I call for it. With a view to this operation, which I hope to commence in the last week of next month, I intend, 1st, forthwith to sum mon the burghers by proclamation duly prepared and published at Cape Town. 2ndly.

To give the rendezvous to the burghers coming from all parts, and the column which I intend to accompany myself, on the same day, at or near a point named within the enemy's country. Previous to this operation, which I anticipate will not occupy above three weeks, I hope to have gained possession of the Waterkloof, and to have provided for the security of the fron tier districts within the colony during my absence; and in British Kaffraria, from which I shall never be distant above three days' march, Major-General Yorke will have a sufficient concentrated force of cavalry and infantry left with him to enable him, with the aid of the newly-established defensible posts in the Amatolas and that on the Temacha River, to con trol that country until my return.

Fort Beaufort, June 21, 1852. Sir, \u2014 On military subjects I have little to add on this occa sion to my other despatches, which embrace the strategic topics on which the progress of the war depends. I find the circumstances of the extensive country in which I command still require the inconvenient diffusion of force which I found established in it, for purposes more of police than war fare, still unavoidable, and until the arrangements already in progress, and which are detailed in my other despatches, come into operation, they must remain so. So that, for the present, I have scarcely any disposable force ; thus I can only under take one operation at a time, and must wait a long time for the g 2"], [110, "THE HON.

Hence the bugbear of the Waterkloof, &c, which has proved so expensive on former occasions, and is only twelve miles, as the crow flies, from my present head-quarters, remains still in a state of blockade. It is strongly occupied by well-armed and numerous enemies, who are desperate from the circumstance of their inability to escape, as much as their attachment to their old haunts. But as soon as au operation, which is probably at this mo ment in progress in Kaffraria under the command of Major- General Yorke, which I have ordered, and from which I antici pate important results, is accomplished, I mean to withdraw the 60th Rifles from the Second Division for a time, and uniting it with the Rifle Brigade under Colonel Buller, with about 1200 British riflemen, and four or five hundred enrolled Fingoes, who have proved throughout the war most valuable, gallant, and faithful assistants, and what other detachments I can collect, I have no doubt of being able to clear and finally occupy those remarkable and inconvenient fastnesses without serious loss or difficulty. In the meantime the blockade with which I have remained satisfied, has been so effectual as to prevent any serious inroads from that quarter into the colony. A recent satisfactory reconnoissance I have personally made of this remarkable country gives me perfect confidence in the result of this operation. You will no doubt hear of many outrages committed re cently in Lower Albany, where the capital of these eastern districts is situated, and whence, therefore, an abundant outcry is raised and circulated, on comparatively slight occasions. It is too true that a band of desperate and lawless marauders, under a most active and mischievous partisan, has lately com mitted great outrages there, but these were all the work of one gang. I have, however, provided amply for the support of that district ; and on my recent visit endeavoured, and I hope"], [111, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC 85 with success, to remind the inhabitants of their power and duties of self-defence. But those calamities are small in comparison to what have been constantly suffered by the inhabitants of this northern district, in which I have, for that reason chiefly, for the present taken up my abode. No army can provide against these sudden outrages unless they become a police ; but a comparatively small police force, supported by troops, and the vigilant and prompt aid of the inhabitants themselves in their own cause, would amply suffice to put an end to them. This I hope to bring about by the police measure detailed in another despatch of this date. Nothing further of an exclusively military nature occurs to me worthy of communicating in this, except an arrangement I have made with a view to keeping possession of advantages gained, with the assistance of the Royal Engineer department and at small expense, without the necessity of crippling my force by large detachments, and which is fully detailed in the enclosure, which is a copy of a letter I have written to the commanding royal engineer under my command, with a view to its being forwarded by him in explanation to the Master General and Board of Ordnance. I have, &c, (Signed) Geo. Cathcart, Lieut.-General, Governor. Right Hod. Sir John S. Pakington, Bart., &c, &c. Enclosure. Fort Beaufort, June 12, 1852. Sir, \u2014 The plans and estimates for the two towers now in process of construction, according to my requisition, are per fectly in accordance with my views and intentions, but I put in writing now the objects I have in view to facilitate explanations"], [112, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 86 to the Master General and Board of Ordnance, as well as to show why the restoration of the Line Drift Post, also essential, would not serve as a substitute for the new Temacha Post, and require the latter without delay. The rules in military fortification adapted to civilised war fare are totally inapplicable to the present circumstances of this country, therefore they must be entirely discarded, and we must find what is suited to our purpose. The enemy have no cannon, and they have no artificial defences, or even buildings of their own ; consequently, they cannot, for a century to come, I think, contemplate the batter ing of a wall or attack upon a defensible stone building. The large enclosures, chiefly composed of mud, with bas tions, &c, I see in this country, called posts or forts, appear to me, for the most part, to be preposterous, and must have been very costly. I find them most inconvenient, for, being con structed for a certain garrison, they are untenable without their complement, and it is sometimes a question with me whether to weaken my disposable force, to hold them, or abandon them altogether. Besides which, the line of frontier having been twice ad vanced, most of the existing posts are now in the wrong places, and no longer available at all. Now, my object being to retain possession of the country gained, what I want is, to have established in the right place, where present circumstances require it, a defensible nucleus adapted for a large or small force, in which ten men, perfectly safe themselves, may command a radius of two or three hun dred yards by the fire of musketry, and with a gun six hun dred yards, so that within that area a large camp may be covered and protected during the absence of the principal part of the force on patrol. This may be effected by the construction of one small cen tral keep or tower, of sufficient height to command and over look all the low huts and tents outside of this tower. 1 would"], [113, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 87 reserve a certain area enclosed with a low wall or breastwork, similar to a churchyard, and this had better be built of stone, without mortar, but connected with the iron clay mud, being more durable than mud embankments, which soon crumble in this dry climate. Every experienced soldier knows how difficult it is to force regular troops out of a churchyard or similar enclosure, even when there is no provision for flanking fire ; but there is no reason why the wall of the enclosure should not be so con structed as to afford that advantage. I have ulterior views in the construction of these posts, and in the selection of their sites ; I anticipate they may hereafter become villages, and in the centre of a village constructed of huts, all one story high, and roofed with thatch or slight mate rials, one tower two stories high, or other defensible stone building, placed in the centre, and with a flat roof, will enable a few men effectually to command and protect it. In case of panic, if the defensible posts be detached and scattered all round tire circumference, as is generally the case in this country in old forts, as Fort Beaufort for example, or the more modern construction of Fort Hare, and no central rallying point exists, the people as well as the garrison know not where to go. Now, if the rallying point be in the centre, and such as I have described as desirable, the detachments and mob will rally to it, aud the voice of the commander will have power to direct and detach the requisite forces in the right directions, retaining a reserve, whilst the women and children would be safe within the enclosure and under the protection of the central tower till the storm had blown over. It is obvious, therefore, that this system is applicable equally to military posts under existing circumstances, and to villages, especially military villages; and had there been this precaution in Woburn and other military villages at the opening of this war, with a proper organisation for \" watch and ward,\" the massacres that took place in them could not have occurred."], [114, "88 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S That this measure is warranted by experience, and that there is nothing new in it, is evinced by the ancient church towers, and other towers which remain from the remote period of his tory in our own country, when a civilised race placed them selves in small numbers in the midst of savages, and ultimately supplanted or subdued them. As to the particular case of the tower to be called \" Castle Eyre\" in the Keiskamma Hoek of the Amatolas, its intention is not limited to mere defensible objects. Its purposes are, first, a demonstration to the warlike, rest less, and troublesome tribe of Gaikas, that the Amatola country, their stronghold, is not again to be abandoned as soon as marched through, as heretofore, and that no hopes remain to them of ever being allowed to recover it, and feed their herds in the fertile pastures which its valleys and hill-tops afford. Secondly. To enable the small force which can be afforded for its occupation, and permanently stationed there, to move out on patrol, leaving at home the smallest possible garrison that may suffice for the protection of the camp during its absence. Thirdly. To form the central nucleus of some mibtary set tlement, which may in time relieve the necessity for military occupation by Her Majesty's regular troops. With regard to the castle at the Temacha. The two last objects stated in respect to the former are com mon to it, but a third rests on political grounds, which are as follows : \u2014 All the T'Slambie chiefs and their tribes are faithful, and from their own interest likely to remain so, with the exception of the Chief Seyolo, who has sided with the hostile Gaikas ; this chief's allotted territory borders on that of the friendly Chief Siwani, being divided by the high road from King Wil bam's Town to Graham's Town by Line Drift. Between these two chiefs, although they are half-brothers, an inveterate enmity exists. Seyolo is now at this time personally the most"], [115, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 89 active, warlike, and inveterate enemy we have to contend with, though his followers do not appear to be so numerous as they were ; he has kept that road closed since the commencement of the war, and still harbours numerous bands of rebel Hotten tots, who have proved very troublesome and mischievous. I have recently thoroughly patrolled through this country, and it is devastated and almost entirely deserted. Commissariat sup plies have, for the first time, I believe, since the war, been passed through Line Drift, but this would be of no avail if I am not prepared to keep permanent occupation of this terri tory. Under cover of the Temacha post, the Chief Siwani has de clared his willingness to occupy the territory up to the Umb dizini River, and I have promised it to him if he can do so, but if he cannot, I will fill it with Fingoes ; and the portion of territory north of the Umbdizini, and between that river and the Amatolas, I find that I can effectually control by a cavalry post to be stationed at Fort White, and thus I hope permanently to secure the whole frontier on the right bank of the Keiskamma from the Amatolas to the sea ; but this import ant object cannot be accompbshed without the support of a post on the Temacha. The object of opening the road by Line Drift will be mainly assisted by this indispensable precaution ; but even that is a secondary consideration, and the restoration of the old post at that drift alone would, as you will perceive, prove no substitute for these objects. The post at Line Drift must also be re-established as soon as possible, and I have to request you to take measures accord ingly without delay. I wish a similar tower to those already alluded to to be placed there, capable of forming a safe nucleus for a large or small force, as circumstances may require, the maximum of which, however, is not likely at any time to exceed two companies of regular infantry, fifty enrolled Fin goes, and some thirty cavalry ; but I hope that ere long less"], [116, "90 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S than half that infantry force will suffice : in the meantime a stone-wall enclosure is immediately indispensable for the secu rity of the post, as it is in an exposed situation. In addition to the above three posts, viz. Castle Eyre, Te macha Castle, and Line Drift, I shall shortly require five similar posts. One on the top of the hill which commands Waterkloof and Fuller's Hoek, and one in the Waterkloof itself, somewhere near to Brown's Farm, as soon as that may be practicable. One will also be required at Middle Drift on the Keiskamma, which will secure that defile on the road between Fort Hare and Fort White, and thereby open a secure communication from hence to King William's Town. Also, for the permanent occupation and security of the Amatolas, one will be required in the Lenea Valley, where Lieutenant-Colonel Michel was recently encamped, and an other on the summit of Mouut Macdonald immediately above it, for the protection of the guns which, by a practicable road, recently constructed, can be placed there, and where there is a spring of water ; this precaution gives the command of the western portion of the Amatolas as effectually as the post on the Keiskamma Hoek does of its eastern parts. In addition to the construction of these towers, I have also to require of your department, as a work of immediate neces sity, that the post at Fort White, which was admirably secured by a temporary arrangement of the officer in command of the detachment of the 6th Regiment during the war, should be put in a sufficient state of repair for present purposes, and that temporary accommodation should be constructed within its enclosure for a troop of cavalry; but although I consider a post at or near the Debe Neck to be essential, it is possible that a better situation for a permanent work might be found, the present wattle-and-dab huts, of which the post consists, being of no value. I have to request you to consider this question, with a view to forming plans and estimates for the"], [117, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 91 future construction of a permanent post at that strategic point. So extensive a demand for the immediate construction of no less than eight castles, considering the vast expense incurred in the erection of former works in this country, most of which are now perfectly useless, will, no doubt, at first sight, appear alarming to the Master General and Board of Ordnance, but when the costs of these castles, according to the estimate now before me for the two which have been commenced, amounting to only \u00a3162 10s. 2d. each, as well as the durability of the structures, come to be considered, and that the probable cost of the eight posts thus required at that rate amounts only to \u00a31300 Is. id., I hope no objection will be made; for although it is perfectly easy to march through this country in all direc tions, and clear all its natural strongholds for the moment by force of arms, I know of no meaus of holding permanent pos session of such an extensive territory with the force at present at my disposal without the aid of a few permanent posts esta blished in those strategic points which the natural conforma tion of the country affords.

Sir J. S. Pakington, Bart. Fort Beaufort, July 20, 1852. Sir, \u2014 On this occasion I am happy to be able to report favourably of the affairs in British Kaffraria. One great advantage gained is the decided and undoubted disunion, and even quarrel, which exists between the hostile"], [118, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 92 Gaikas and their Hottentot associates, which is confirmed by enclosure No. 3, which is a statement made by the hostile Chief Sandilli, and repeated by the hitherto most troublesome enemy we have had to contend with, Seyolo, who further cor roborates information we have already received, that the greater part of the Gaika tribe have migrated beyond the Kei, and that no Kafirs or cattle are to be seen in the eastern and prin cipal part of the Amatola country, in the midst of which we have now an established and secure station, with the purpose, which they can no longer doubt, of permanent occupation. The other post on the Temacha, whilst it secures the direct communication between Graham's Town and King William's Town, continues, in conjunction with a cavalry force stationed at Fort White, to keep entirely untenanted by Kafirs the whole line of country, outside of the colonial boundary, from the base of the Amatolas to where it joins the lands of the friendly Chiefs Siwani and Umkye, who reach to the sea. When I say untenanted by Kafirs, I mean that no huts or kraals exist there, and no cattle can show themselves on the pastures ; but the Chiefs Seyolo and Stock, with a few followers, lurk in kloofs near to where the river Umdizini falls into the Keis kamma, but no molestation or trouble is now given by these people. These communications from the proscribed Gaika chiefs, you will observe, pass through a friendly chief to the T'Slam bie Commissioner ; for no public servant is authorised to com municate with them on this side of the Kei. The combined movement, successfully carried into effect by Major-General Yorke, in which Lieutenant- Colonel Eyre's column had the good fortune to surprise the Hottentot laager, and the excellent management of the quarrel between the T'Slambie chiefs and the Gaikas by the T'Slambie Commis sioner Captain Maclean, under the orders of the Chief Com missioner Colonel Mackinnon, on occasion of the quarrel about the Chief Toise, have tended much to this favourable state of"], [119, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 93 things, which I think is capable of further benefit and im provement. Iu the western corner of the Amatolas, as I have before on several occasions stated, there remain a considerable number of Kafirs who possess some cattle ; these have never been seri ously molested duriDg this war, and I have not had time or troops to do so further than recently to go and surprise and burn their extensive kraals and dwellings, which the cold w-eather had induced them to move down into the sheltered kloofs near the ruined military village of Auckland ; but they have given no trouble, and when I return from the Kei I hope to be able easily to dislodge them. When I go to the Kei, which I must do next week, I leave British Kaffraria in perfect security under the command of Major-General Yorke, with three regiments of infantry and a considerable force of cavalry and levies, and there are no vul nerable points to be guarded, except the residence of the T'Slambie Commissioner near Fort Murray, where there is a sufficient garrison, and a missionary station at Mount Coke, situated in the districts of friendly chiefs, and for the security of which ample means of protection have been provided ; and with the small force withdrawn for my expedition I shall pro bably never be more than four days' march from the centre of British Kaffraria. I cannot close this without adverting to the conviction I have already often expressed, that no time should be lost in providing for the future occupation of this fine country, if it is to be retained by colonists capable of organisation for self defence.

SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 94 Copy of a Despatch from Lieutenant-General the Hon. G. Cathcart to the Right Hon. Sir J. S. Pakington, Bart. Fort Beaufort, July 20, 1852. Sir, \u2014 The peculiar warfare in which I am engaged does not afford me any remarkable occurrences to report. I have steacbly adhered to the course I laid down for my guidance in the outset, with a view to progressive advances towards the attainment of the main object of my duty, \u2014 the estabbshment of a lasting peace ; with this view I have en deavoured to gain every advantage I am able to do, and keep it, and with as little loss as may be. When I last wrote I had not received the report of Major- General Yorke, respecting the successful result of an attack upon the laager of the leader of a formidable Hottentot ban ditti, who have caused great commotion of late within the colony, and who had established themselves for security amongst the hostile Kafirs, in a remarkably strong and well chosen position, not far from King William's Town. The enclosed General Order will place you in possession of the details of this operation, in which Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre, 73rd Regiment, had the good fortune to fall upon the enemy by surprise, and inflict a severe chastisement upon them ; and in which, under critical circumstances, that able and dis tinguished officer evinced the same military talent and pre sence of mind which he has on so many former occasions. Since then, owing to the quiescent state of British Kaffraria, (which I am inclined to think is in some measure to be at tributed to the system of permanent occupation by certain established posts in the right places,) I have been enabled to withdraw the 60th Rifles from that district ; and the enclosed General Order of the 12th of July, 1852, will explain the use I have made of them, in respect to the abatement of the great nuisance, to the colony, of the Waterkloof as a harbour for hostile Kafirs and marauding Hottentots, which remained"], [121, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 95 so far within the colonial boundary, and has hitherto proved most detrimental to the colonists. After that visit to the Waterkloof, the difficulty of access having only enabled me to provide the men with three days' rations, and the mountains being covered with snow, which, in this usually warm climate, is severely felt, I caused them to return to their respective camps below, for a few days ; but, on the 14th instant, I reassembled the same force, consisting of the 60th Rifles, the Rifle Brigade, two squadrons of the Cape Mounted Riflemen, four guns, and a detachment with rockets, and some enrolled native levies, on the summit of the Kroome Mountain ; and having personally selected a fit place for an encampment, and the site for two defensible redoubts imme diately commanding the interval which separates the Water kloof from Fuller's Hoek, I caused it to be occupied, leaving Colonel Buller to give all aid and assistance to the officer of Royal Engineers in the construction of the redoubts. The position of this camp is secured on one side by a long range of cliffs, inaccessible even to Kafirs, and the two re doubts, which will be merely stone wall enclosures, a sufficient precaution in Kafir warfare, will secure a space capable of con taining a large encampment, and be perfectly defensible against any Kafir attack, with a garrison of one company. The effect of this demonstration has been already found to produce great consternation among the Kafirs, who appear to have flattered themselves, that by obstinate perseverance on their part they would ultimately obtain their object, and be allowed to keep permanent possession of these districts. Many spoors or traces have been observed, indicating that migration has partially commenced ; and the establishment of a perma \u2022 nent post in the midst of the Kroome Mountains, with such powerful means of constant annoyance on our part, and the certainty of ultimate starvation on theirs, cannot fail ere long effectually to get rid of this last Kafir nuisance remaining"], [122, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 96 within the colony, without occasion for any violent measures attended with unnecessary loss to Her Majesty's troops. This tract of mountain country, though, perhaps, almost unparalleled in the advantages it possesses for harbouring ob stinate and determined defenders, is, after all, but of limited extent ; it is also insulated twenty-five miles within the colony. and far removed from the support of any remaining Kafir chief who could now be found to raise the war-cry, and come with his clan to the assistance of the obstinate intruder Ma como in so desperate and unprofitable a cause. With regard to ulterior operations, political circumstances have rendered it, in my judgment, imperative that I should proceed without delay to invade the territory of the paramount Chief Kreib, who has aided and abetted the rebellious Gaikas throughout the war, and has refused to pay the fine, in token of submission, imposed upon him by my predecessor; there are many, and even more cogent reasons of policy, which will appear in other despatches, which render this measure impe rative, and therefore need not be entered into in this. The country in which I shall have to act is, I understand, perfectly open, and there are no difficulties to contend with ; but the force I have at my disposal, without denuding the country I leave behind me of sufficient protection, will con sist only of about 1860 regular troops, and 450 irregulars, exclusive of such burghers as may answer my call by procla mation, a copy of which is enclosed. This I intend to divide into two columns, the one commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Michel, of the 6th Regiment, who will join me at Bramneck, from King William's Town, with a commissariat convoy ; bis column will consist of the 6th and 91st Regiments, two guns drawn by mules, a troop of mounted levies, and a proportion of infantry, European and Fingoe levies ; the second will consist of one squadron of the 12th Lancers, two squadrons of the Cape Mounted Riflemen with two guns, and four com-"], [123, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 97 panies of the Rifle Brigade with a proportion of levies, under the command of LieutenaDt-Colonel Napier; and I intend my self to proceed with my own escort of cavalry, and about 300 enrolled Fingoes, under very able and active officers, which auxiliary force, when attached and properly commanded, I find to be most efficient, and capable of rendering good service, and which will be available for the reinforcement of either column, as occasion may require. Besides this, I shall be joined by a mixed force of Euro pean and native levies, which has hitherto been employed under the command of Captain Tylden, of the Royal Engi neers, and have done good service in very critical times against the Tambookies, but who, having now vanquished their ene mies, I hope to be able to dispense with, or, at all events, greatly to reduce after the termination of this campaign ; these may amount to about 600 good men, well armed, and a large portion mounted. I have also to expect the co-operation of a deputation of burghers from each frontier district, whom I have called upon by proclamation to join me in their own cause, according to the ancient commando system. If my call be duly responded to, these alone ought to suffice for the chastisement of the contumacious chief, as they will be all mounted and well armed, and formerly evinced great spirit and enterprise ; but I am warned not to expect too much from them in these days, and I do not reckon upon more than 400 or 500 at the utmost. My intention is to pass the Kei at one place, about 80 miles above its conflueuce with the sea, starting from Whittlesea or Shiloh as my base, and with the regular troops, making the principal residence of the chief my object, whilst the irregular troops, with requisite supports, may busy themselves in the capture of cattle to the extent which I may deem necessary for the purpose of example; and I hope by this means to con vince the Chief Moshesh, whose territories will not be far dis tant, that it is his interest to pay certain fines which have been H"], [124, "THE HON.

When this operation is completed, I have great hopes that I may be able to make more rapid progress towards the satis factory close of the war than I have yet been able to do ; aud by obliging the colonists to exert themselves for their own protection, in cases which are more properly those of police than warfare, I hope shortly to be able greatly to reduce the expenditure which at present is incurred by the British Go vernment for their benefit.

Cathcart to the Right Hon. Sir John S. Pakington, Bart. Fort Beaufort, July 20, 1852. Sir, \u2014 Having closed my several despatches respecting the affairs of the Sovereignty and of British Kaffraria, as well as"], [125, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 99 my military report up to this date, to avoid the risk of missing the post, the communication with Cape Town being somewhat uncertain, owing to the bad weather, I now, avoiding as far as I can unnecessary repetition, proceed to frame a general sum mary of the affairs of the colony of the Cape of Good Hope. The Lieutenant-Governor will, no doubt, with his usual ability and perspicuity, put you in possession of all that relates to civil matters, especially in the Western districts and seat of Government, with all of which he keeps me duly informed by every post; nothing of importance occurs without my know ledge, and no measure of moment is carried into effect by him without my entire concurrence ; and I cannot express in too strong terms the obligations I am under to him for his cordial co-operation with me in our joint duties and respousibilities on every occasion. As regards the affairs of these frontier districts, I have only therefore to report in detail those which relate to the main object of my mission, \u2014 the termination of this frontier warfare in as satisfactory and speedy a manner as may be. My other despatches will explain the actual state of things in these districts, but there are one or two peculiar features of the case to which it is necessary I should call your notice. Demoralisation of society, resulting from warfare in various ways, is too well known a fact to require comment, as applied to present circumstances generally ; but there is a peculiar instance in the present case resulting from it. I plainly perceive a habit of reliance on military aid without adequate exertion on the part of those most interested. Colonists within the frontier expect troops to do duty virtually not only as police, but as herdsmen and shepherds for their benefit, whilst they are becoming slow and apathetic in their own cause. The removal of the Kafir enemy from the frontier was under taken and nearly accomplished at great exertion and expense bv Her Majesty's troops and of imperial treasure ; but unfor- H 2"], [126, "100 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S tunate circumstances, too well known to you to be here set forth, have induced restless and licentious habits among the Hottentot part of the community ; and, although this has generally subsided, there remain numerous bands of desperate marauders, but who, from recent discomfiture and the privations they are obliged to endure, as well as their quarrel with the hostile Kafirs, are no longer formidable. We have nearly cleared the country from Kafir aggression by force of arms, and will soon, I hope, have accomplished the task; how we are to keep this advantage without military occupation is a problem which remains to be solved ; and on this subject I have already said all I can in my Despatch, No. 4, of the 20th April, to Earl Grey and others ; and my opinions remain unchanged. But as to the securing the province within the boundary, it is manifestly a question of police, and one in which a regular army cannot avail, unless it be broken up into a police force; and if so, the community, and not the British public, ought to be charged with the expense. With these views I have provided an ample police or ganisation, now under military law, but so calculated as to readily become a civil institution ; and it is already in a great state of forwardness, and a large proportion in successful activity. To start this measure in an efficient manner, and without loss of time, I thought the wisest course was not to hesitate at the necessary expense ; for delay and false economy might have induced failure and protracted expenditure, or produce an inefficient thing after all. The police arrangements I have made provisionally are already known to you ; and that I contemplate this or some other more or less efficient, and more or less expensive, police arrangement may, or indeed must, be adopted by the colony at its own expense. Meanwhile, I look for reduction of expen diture on the termination of the war, which, I am happy to think, is now decidedly in its wane, and near its close."], [127, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 101 Military occupation beyond the border, till some other can be devised, is obviously the only barrier against the reflux of barbarous enemies ; for the vacuum must be occupied either by friends or foes. Within the colony the energies of a population having the advantages of superior civilisation ought to suffice for their own protection, if duly organised and properly directed, and this I have endeavoured to do. In my Circular to the Civil Commissioners of districts, a copy of which is enclosed, I have called upon them to furnish contingents to my intended expedition beyond the Kei ; I have candidly explained to them all my views and opinions, and concealed nothing. They are in accordance with the instructions and opinions of Her Majesty's Government, ex pressed in various despatches to myself and predecessor, which have been published iu Parliamentary papers, and of these the colonists are in possession, in which I sincerely concur ; and as they appear on the face of the enclosed document, I need not trouble you with any comment respecting them. As to reduction of expenditure, although it is my most anxious desire, I can only as yet see a prospect of slow but progressive amendment ; I am ably assisted by an advantage which none of my predecessors possessed, but which I insisted upon \u2014 the presence of the chief commissariat officer at my head quarters ; and by availing myself of the experience and know ledge of business of Commissary-General Maclean, the esta bbshmeut of a Board of Investigation, and the talents and assiduity of my Military Secretary,* I feel confident that no abuse can escape unnoticed, that every practicable measure of economy will be adopted as soon as urgent necessity will per mit, and that, at all events, I shall be able to render a plain and satisfactory account of my stewardship in respect to the expenditure of the public money in the conduct of this war, since I have been in command, whenever it may be required of me.

When I may have been able to effect this, and when, by concentrating the troops now performing police duty, I hope to more than compensate for the expense of the police, which I never fail to impress upon the public ought to be, and must be, a colonial charge.

In the wording of the Ordinance, the phrase, \" Every man capable of bearing arms,\" appears ; it is scarcely necessary to explain, that I do not expect this to be taken in the literal sense \u2014 all I require is, a deputation of all the fighting meu who can really come to represent their district ; but I expect that all those who are not fighting men, and stop at home, will encourage and assist to their utmost those who go forth in their cause, giving them ample means of equipment and sup port, in respect to their horses, arms, and sustenance, until they meet me ; for I will not issue rations to those who may profess to come, and may not arrive."], [129, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 103 I am here to do my best, to put an end to this long and tiresome war, and to establish a lasting peace on this fron tier, if I can; but the colonists themselves must help me to do so. The hostile Kafirs are nearly subdued, and removed to a distance from the border; a bttle more exertion and perse verance will complete this work. Certain Hottentot ma rauders are still roaming about the country, but when concentrated for mischief, do not amount to 300 men. As to the Kafirs, precautions must still be taken calculated to prevent their return, and tardy or, half measures will not, suffice to do this. As to the 300 robbers, a thousand mounted police \u2014 who, if they are not already enrolled, aud on duty, is no fault of mine \u2014 should suffice alone to protect these frontier districts from their ravages, and, if duly sup ported, ere long to root them out. Much treasure, loss of life, and hard service of Her Ma jesty's regular troops and paid levies, have, as you well know, been expended by the British Government for the protection of this colony, from which the mother country derives no real benefit, except in the possession of the seaport of Simon's Bay ; the mother country is, therefore, actuated, possibly, in some degree, by national pride, but mainly by benevolent sympathy, in making the great sacrifice she has done in this cause. Perhaps the protection of certain colonists who were encou raged by the British Government on the eastern frontier, upwards of thirty years ago, might, to a certain extent, be con sidered an obligation ; but such obligations have their limits, aud grants of better land elsewhere, where sheep and oxen can feed in security, or pecuniary compensation, far less expensive than a succession of Kafir wars, would provide amply and equitably for any such claims. This must probably be the last Kafir war carried on in this country at the cost of the British Government \u2014 for the ex-"], [130, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCAR's'S 104 penses of another, amounting to one million sterling, cannot again be expected to be drawn, by vote of the Imperial Parlia ment, from the pockets of the British constituency, in a cause, in which, except from motives of sympathy and benevolence, it has no real interest. The object of my intended expedition beyond the Kei is twofold : 1st. To test the power and willingness of the colonists to come forward in their own cause. 2ndly. If they do so come forward, to demonstrate to the influential paramount chief of their most formidable and rancorous Kafir enemies that, independently of the irresistible power of Her Majesty's armies, there is a force and energy within the colony sufficient to chastise him, should he again be guilty of aiding or abetting in hostilities against the colony. If, therefore, I should find myself ill supported on this occasion, which I will not believe, I have ample means to go forward with Her Majesty's troops, and vindicate the national honour ; but I should then arrive at the painful conviction that the colonists of the present day have not the energy to exert themselves in their own cause, and therefore have not the power to keep their enemies at the distance to which we have removed them; and what is worse, the Chief Kreili, convinced of the same fact, instead of standing in awe of them, would thenceforward hold them in the estimation which they would deserve. There are persons who attempt to prejudice the good opinion I now cherish of the people of this part of the colony which I am appointed to govern, who tell me that my prede cessor was disappointed on a similar occasion, and that I am too sanguine in my expectations that the call which I have made will be duly and cordially responded to : I will not believe them. I have myself witnessed too many brilliant examples of patience under misfortunes, of energy, and of courage, among the colonists of these northern districts, which"], [131, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 105 are more immediately under my own eye, to give the slightest attention to such unworthy rumours. I will wait and form my own judgment on the event ; but, should I be disappointed, I wish you to remind the inhabitants of your district of the moral of the fable, which says, that if, when the waggon is in a hole, the waggoner will not put his own shoulder to the wheel, Jupiter will not help him. In preparing to go to the Kei, I have not been unmindful of internal security ; three whole regiments, and numerous armed levies will be left within the frontier, to support an ample police force, which either is or ought to be in activity, in the protection of the eastern districts ; an equal force will occupy British Kaffraria, beyond your frontier, during my short absence. . When I return from my expedition beyond the Kei, I must make my report to Her Majesty's Government, not only as to the result of that expedition, but as to whether I have found the people of this colony grateful for the support which has been afforded them, and willing and able to exert themselves in their own cause, and therefore deserving \u2014 or the contrary, as the case may be ; and whether, therefore, I consider their cause worth fighting for or not. In the latter event, I should probably be ordered to with draw my army ; and my parting advice to the colonists of the eastern half of this colony, at least, could only be : \u2014 Keep fewer sheep and oxen, and provide yourselves with more shep herds and herdsmen ; for wild men and wild beasts will soon again recover their ancient sovereignty in the Fish River and Zuurberg et ultra ; and you will be unable to drive them out, as your fathers did in the olden time.

Cathcart to the Right Hon. Sir John S. Pakington, Bart. Fort Beaufort, July 28, 1852. Sir, \u2014 Since my last despatch respecting British Kaffraria, the state of the country formerly occupied by the Chief Sandilli and powerful Gaika tribe remains as then stated ; and the policy of occupation by established posts appears most mate rially to have obtained its object by the expulsion of the former tenants from that extensive district. But, as extermi nation would be equally repugnant to humanity as it is impracticable, the only result I ever anticipated was, that, by steadily persevering in the proscription and persecution of the rebellious chiefs and heads of clans, I should induce them, either to migrate with their clans as a body across the Kei, or should they, as they appear still determined to do, obstinately remain, in a state of starvation, in their lurking-places, uuder the false hopes of an unstable peace, that their followers would desert them, and gradually merge into the friendly tribes, in which they have naturally many relations and con nections, and prefer a life of peace, under the control and re sponsibility of other chiefs, who, being friendly, are allowed to enjoy these benefits. The enclosed Report from the Chief Commissioner (my reply is also enclosed), transmitting copy of a letter from the T'Slambie Commissioner, gives reason to believe that this movement is now seriously in progress, if not already accom plished ; but so important a revolution in the affairs of these tribes cannot be expected to take place without producing a variety of results, some of which are liable to inconvenience, and it is a subject of some anxiety, lest the leaven of hostility thus intermingled with the friendly tribes may not occasion some temporary embarrassment. Should, however, any of the friendly chiefs, unmindful of the benefits they enjoy, and the great wealth in cattle which"], [133, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 107 they have accumulated during the war, commit themselves, either by open acts of hostilities, or neglect of the powers of controlling the actions of their followers, the nature of their country is very different from that of which the Gaikas have been dispossessed ; and I apprehend no difficulty will be found in bruiging them immediately to a sense of their duty and interests. The nuisance of Hottentot marauders, who, though no longer in alliance with the Kafir chiefs, find some lawless Kafir associates to join with them for the sake of plunder, still avail themselves of the shelter afforded by the Kaffrarian forests ; but some recent severe examples appear to have much di minished the boldness of their exploits ; and I hope, ere long, by means of partisan corps, chiefly composed of Fingoes, to hunt them up into their Laagers, and either destroy them in de tail, or render their lives so insecure as to oblige them to fly the country. The first experiment of this mode of treatment was attended with perfect success ; for a Laager was surprised in this manner by a body of Fingoes, on the 23rd instant, when they killed six of the number, two of whom being recognised as leading men among these miscreants. I have, &c, (Signed) Geo. Cathcart, Lieutenant-General, Governor, and High Commissioner. The Right Hon. Sir J. S. Pakington, Bart., &c. &c. Enclosure. Fort Beaufort, July 24, 1852. Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your most important communication, dispatched from King William's Town yesterday, and which has just reached me, acquainting me that the hostile Kafirs have dispersed among the friendly tribes, and abandoned Sandilli, and other chiefs who were leagued with him in the Gaika rebellion."], [134, "108 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S This is precisely the result aimed at and desired in the policy to which I have adhered from the commencement of my admi nistration ; the quarrel which I espouse was between Her Majesty's Government and the chiefs who were leagued in rebellion ; and with these, as I have uniformly declared, I will not treat on this side of the Kei ; but as to their subjects, I never contemplated or desired their extermination, a measure as repugnant to humanity as impracticable in execution. I always hoped for the merging into the friendly tribes of these rebellious clansmen, whom I cannot but respect for their loyalty to their chiefs among their relations and friends ; and so long as the chiefs of the tribes into which they have merged will secure their good conduct, my quarrel with them has ceased. You will remember I distinctly made known these views to the Chief Siwani, through Commissioner Maclean, promising him the territory up to the Umdizini, and amnesty to those followers of his rebellious brother Seyolo, who might return to their allegiance under the authority and responsibility of their legitimate chiefs. As to certain overtures made by Seyolo, I desire that he should be told that he, having chosen to join the Gaika re bellion, I must consider him still as one of the proscribed Gaika chieftains, and have no word for him on this side of the Kei. You will be pleased to communicate these principles of my policy, in respect to the Gaika rebellion, to the T'Slambie Commissioner, and request him to act accordingly ; which I feel confident he will do with bis admirable judgment and discretion, on every opportunity which may offer for esta blishing and confirming this most desirable state of things.

Cathcart to the Right Hon. Sir John S. Pakington, Bart. Fort Beaufort, July 28, 1852. Sir \u2014 One week only has elapsed since my last despatch on the military affairs of my command, but as I am on the eve of my departure for an expedition beyond the Kei, which, under existing circumstances, I consider absolutely to require my personal direction, I may not have an opportunity of writing again before the departure of the next mail. In my last, I detailed the plan of operations ; that I had provided for an ample magazine of supplies at Whittlesea, which have been accumulating for the last six weeks from the neighbouring districts, as far as practicable, so as to avoid unnecessary transport ; from that base to the Kei is, in fact, only two days' march, and my intention is, to establish an entrepot midway, with sufficient protection, so that as few waggons as possible may suffice for the constant supply of the wants of the force in the field. I might have been induced, by opinions which were given to me, to rely upon resources to be obtained from the Buffalo Mouth, and through Kaffraria; but it is fortunate that I adopted the more regular course which I have done, as the recent tempestuous weather has rendered the landing of supplies at that port so difficult, that they are absolutely in want of provisions at King William's Town ; and, had I"], [136, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 110 trusted to that source, the expedition must have been post poned. The loss of the \" Bfrkenhead,\" which deprived me of nearly 400 men, and no reinforcements having since reached me, renders it excessively difficult to provide for the security of the countries that I leave behind me whilst I move forward on this indispensable expedition ; but the arrangements I have made will obviate any inconveniences which can possibly arise during my absence, commensurate with the advantages which must result from the issue of this campaign, not merely as regards the chastisement of the Chief Kreili, but a warning to the Chief Moshesh, and a demonstration that we are not merely on the defensive, but have a disposable force whenever its agency may be required. In the meantime I am happy to say that the occupation of the Kroome Heights, and some successful operations against its troublesome tenants, have been attended with all the advan tages that I could have desired ; and although the necessity for my absence, with a small portion of the force at my disposal, may render the expulsion of the enemy from these fastnesses at present incomplete, I leave sufficient force to keep the advan tage gained ; and if the enemy do not evacuate the Waterkloof before my return, which I expect they will, the estabbsbment of a similar post at its entrance, for which I have not available troops at present, will permanently and inevitably accomplish that object. I have the honour to enclose a report of Colonel Buller, of an attack made by him with the troops under his command on the Kroome Heights against the principal remaining habitations of the Kafirs, Tambookies, and Hottentots associated with the obstinate chief Macomo, who, though on former occasions they shifted their ground, it appears have never been dislodged from this mountain district, and regained full possession when the troops retired. On this occasion so severe a punishment has been inflicted, that none of the enemy have ventured since to"], [137, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 111 approach the camp, and the whole of the upper part of the valley of the Waterkloof, which extends nearly seven miles in length, seems to have been evacuated. The two field works have been completed, and the 60th Rifles, with a detachment of Fingoe Levy and a most efficient European Volunteer Com pany, will remain in occupation. The arrangements I have made for the security of the colony within the boundary, as well as the force under the command of Major-General Yorke in British Kaffraria during my ab sence, have already been detailed in my former despatch. I have, &c, (Signed) Geo. Cathcart, Lieutenant-General, Commander of the Forces. The Right Hon. Sir J. S. Pakington, Bart., &c. &c. Copy of a Despatch/tow Lieut.-General the Hon. G.

Sir, \u2014 In addition to my military despatch, which I closed before leaving Fort Beaufort on the expedition in which I am at present engaged, all previous arrangements, as therein stated, have been most punctually carried into effect by all concerned up to the present time, and with the desired success. The weather has been most favourable, and appears likely to continue so, which is an object of importance as the troops on patrol are necessarily without tents. I arrived on the Umvani with Colonel Napier's column and my head- quarters from Fort Beaufort on the 6th instant, the day appointed in my proclamation, and was there met by Lieut. - Colonel Michel's column from King Wilbam's Town, and find ing some scarcity of wood for fuel I proceeded in the afternoon through Bramneck to the sources of the Balotta, about six miles to the front, where I found admirable camping ground"], [138, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 112 for any number of men, horses, and cattle, with abundance of wood, water, and grass. There I remained until the 10th instant, in order to allow the baggage animals time to rest, and to give time for the arrival of such of the burgher force and irregulars as were known to be on their way. During the three days' halt I caused a capacious bushed and stockaded square inclosure to be formed and defended by four small works or bastions, one at each angle, which work was admirably and most expeditiously completed under the super intendence of Captain Tylden of the Royal Engineers. The object of this work was to contain empty commissariat waggons and their oxen in perfect security, and to enable a small detachment to keep open the communication with Whittlesea in the only difficult or assailable part of it. With regard to the burgher contingent which joined me at that camp, in the case of some districts I have reason to be well satisfied with the patriotic spirit evinced ; in others, I am willing to admit the validity of excuses for non-attendance; in others, again, I am disappointed in the favourable opinion I would have wished to have formed of them : but as the general result has completed my cavalry force to 1000 horses, for which number my supplies were calculated, I have all that I could desire for the actual service, and more would have proved an inconvenience. The insight, however, which this experiment has given me into the character and deserts of the communities in the several districts, and, indeed, throughout the colony, will, I am con vinced, prove of much practical value ; but I will reserve all remarks on this subject for a future despatch. On the evening of the 9th instant two ambassadors from the chief Kreili came into my camp with a flag of truce. I did not receive them personally, but the inclosed minute contains my answer, communicated to them by Mr. Ayliff, my acting secre tary and interpreter. On the 10th instant, leaving 50 men of the 6th and 50 of"], [139, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 113 the 91st Regiments in the Balotta intrenched camp, with a pro portion of native infantry irregulars and a detachment of the Cape Mounted Rifles, the whole under the command of Captain Cahill of the 91st, I marched at daybreak with the rest of the force in the direction of the Sabolela Drift or Ford over the Kei, a distance of about nine miles. On arriving there I assembled all the mounted burgher force and irregulars in front, and crossed the river at their head. No resistance was offered, and the enemy did not appear. Having selected a suitable camping ground commanding a capacious loop of land formed by the winding of the river on the left bank, and also commanding the ford, I established the intended standing camp. The two Kafir ambassadors marched with us across the Kei, and were then sent on their return to their chief. The following morning (the 11th instant), after causing the tents of the two patrolbng columns to be struck, and leaving directions with Major Horsford of the Rifle Brigade to take them in charge, and to contract the standing camp and commis sariat supplies into a convenient and defensible position, I pro ceeded in the order which is detailed in the enclosed \" Memo randum of Movements,\" and halted for the night at a distance of about twelve miles in an easterly direction. The enemy had endeavoured to burn the grass on our route, but with only partial success, and they had very recently aban doned the country ; the distant hills at all points on the horizon were seen on fire. On that evening about 500 dismounted and some 50 mounted Kafirs were seen assembled od a hill a few miles in front of the left of our bivouac ; and from information given by a Kafir woman, who was taken and afterwards released, it appears that all the young men are absent, endeavouring to drive cattle out of our reach, and that all the elders were assembled in council at the chief Kreili's \" great place.'' It is therefore probable that the body of Kafirs seen on the hill consisted of members of that assembly. i"], [140, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 114 On the following morning I marched an hour before daylight with the whole of the burghers and irregulars, supported by four companies of the 6th Regiment, in the direction of Kreili's chief kraal, which proved to be seated in a beautiful and fertile valley, studded with other recently-deserted kraals, at a distance of about eight miles from our bivouac. One difficult and very defensible rocky gorge had to be passed, but no enemy appeared, and on arriving on the summit of a precipitous ridge which immediately overhangs the chief's residence I baited with the support, and leaving Captain Tylden, with 200 mounted Fin goes and Kama's Kafirs, to observe the approach to the pass in our rear, sent down some mounted burghers and Fingoe levies to burn the houses, which was done. Some few Kafirs only were discernible on the distant bills : though no doubt there were many thousands of concealed witnesses, too much panic-stricken to offer any resistance on our advance or return to our bivouac. Lieutenant- Colonel Napier, immediately on our return, who had been ordered to halt and observe our movements, in case I should have required aid, moved off about 9 a.m., in the direc tion of the source of the Somo, and I have since heard reached the drift over that river that night. Lieutenant-Colonel Michel was to move with bis column a short day's march in the direction assigned to him in the \" Memorandum of Movements.\" I returned in the afternoon with my staff and cavalry escort to this camp, without the slightest interruption or hindrance, or even seeing a single Kafir passing through about twelve miles of country, which, judging from the numerous recently deserted dwellings and large cattle kraals, and other indi cations, must in ordinary times be very populous and well stocked. With regard to ulterior measures, it is my intention to re main at this camp until I can hear of the result of the opera tions of the two patrolling columns ; and if their joint success"], [141, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 115 in this first patrol should amount to the capture of 7000 head of cattle, I should consider that enough had been done, and that it would be far preferable to close the campaign and with draw the troops, with a view to other no less important services, which still remain to be completed in British Kaffraria and within the colony, than to protract it with a view to the acqui sition of cattle, which I consider a very secondary consideration to the other important advantages which I think cannot fail to result from it, and if I should be able to do so a considerable saving of expense will be effected. As soon as it is in my power to decide this point it is my intention to leave the chief command in the hands of Colonel Mackinnon, who, though the acceptance of the resignation of his appointment as Chief Commissioner of British Kaffraria has reached me, and for the present remains, with his know ledge, in my hands, is here with me in the field, and continues to render his able, zealous, and willing assistance to me, until it shall be convenient to rebeve him from his duties. As soon as I have given the necessary orders to Colonel Mackinnon I intend starting with my cavalry escort and led horses, and hope to reach King William's Town in two days, passing across the Kabousie country, and thence, after making arrangements for carrying on the government of British Kaf fraria by the appointment (pending Her Majesty's pleasure) of Captain Maelean, the T'Slambie Commissioner, as Acting Chief Commissioner in succession to Colonel Mackinnon, I hope to reach Fort Beaufort in two days more, and resume the urgent duties, both civil and military, of the several governments under my charge, which will not admit of a more protracted stay in this remote quarter.

SIR GEORGE CATIICART'S 116 Copy of a Despatch//w\u00bb Governor Lieut.-General the Hon. G. Cathcart to the Right Hon. Sir J. S. Pakington. Fort Beaufort, September 20, 1852. Sir, \u2014 Since my last military report, dated 15th August, 1852, more than a month has elapsed from the time I have had an opportunity of reporting the operations beyond the Kei. In that despatch I stated, that after burning the residence of the chief Kreili, and starting the two columns under the com mand of Lieutenant- Colonel Michel and Lieutenant- Colonel Napier on their respective forays, I bad returned to my stand ing camp on the Kei ; and that if the joint success of this first patrol should amount to the capture of 7000 head of cattle, I should consider that enough had been done, and that it would be far preferable to close the campaign and withdraw the troops, with a view to other no less important services, than to protract it for the acquisition of cattle, which I deemed a secondary consideration ; and if I should be able to do so, a considerable saving of expense would be effected. On the 15th and 17th of August I received Lieutenant- Colonel Michel's reports of the result of his foray, in which he had captured 1300 head of cattle, but had found the line of country he had taken difficult, and had returned to Crouch's station, having still two days' provisions available. The only casualties which occurred on this patrol were one man of the Royal Artillery killed, and one of the King William's Town Volunteers wounded. Under these circumstances, relying upon the perseverance and energy of Lieutenant- Colonel Napier, from whom I had as yet received no report, I recalled Lieutenant Colonel Michel's column, and sent it to the Sabolela, intending, should I be disappointed in the first foray, to direct both columns into the Daggana country, which is on the right bank of the Kei, opposite to Kreili's kraal, a mountainous but not difficult"], [143, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 117 country, into which that chief's personal property in cattle was supposed to be secreted. On the 20th instant I received Lieu tenant- Colonel Napier's reports of his operations, in which he had captured upwards of 8000 head of cattle, 100 horses, and 1000 goats. This success is mainly to be attributed to the perseverance and skilful management of the officer in command; hut it would be injus tice to omit to mention the able assistance afforded him by the burgher contingents under the command of Messrs. Kruyger and Van Aardt, certain contingents commanded by Captain Tylden of the Royal Engineers, who has so often distinguished himself in the defence of the north-eastern districts, and of the Fort Beaufort Fingoe levy, commanded by Captain Campbell, and the whole supported by the 91st Regiment and two squad rons of the Cape Mounted Riflemen. The enemy fled on the approach of this force, and hut little resistance was offered, and no casualties occurred. Upwards of 500 head of cattle were also captured by patrols from the standing camp ; so that on the whole the punishment inflicted on the chief Kreili amounted to 9800 head of cattle, not includ ing horses, calves, and goats. Under these circumstances I decided upon closing the cam paign and withdrawing the troops, in order to employ them on other no less important services. Leaving Colonel Mackinnon at the Balotta camp to super intend the distribution of the cattle, I proceeded with my staff and cavalry escort across the vast untenanted plains formerly allotted to the Tambookie chief Mapassa, and, crossing the Windvogel Berg and Kabousie River, arrived at King William's Town on the 24th ultimo. The inclosed summary of military events, and accompanying documents, will sufficiently detail ulterior movements of the troops, and until my return to Fort Beaufort on the 28th ; and on the following day the troops had all returned to their respec tive quarters from whence they had started."], [144, "118 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCAR's'S The next object of military importance was the final expul sion of the lawless bands of Kafirs, Tambookies, and Hottentots from the Waterkloof and other fastnesses comprised within the Kroome range of mountains. Accordingly, measures were taken to assemble a sufficient force to accomplish their invest ment on all sides, and render this a matter of certainty ; but it was necessary, with this view, to withdraw the 73rd Regiment from King William's Town; and as I had learnt that their zealous and able commander, who was in ill health from over fatigue, and had been on sick leave for a short time since the affair at Murray's Krautz, was on his way to join, I waited till the 9th instant, when the regiment marched, and arrived at Fort Beaufort on the 12th instant. After one day's halt the operations commenced which are detailed in inclosed documents, and the result of which I have every reason to hope will prove the final removal of a nuisance which has so long proved the scourge of these districts. I have provided for the permanent occupation of the Water kloof by the post already established in the Kroome Heights, which separates the Waterkloof from Fuller's Hoek, at present occupied by the 60th Regiment. A defensible inclosure, 100 yards square, having a circular stone redoubt 25 yards in diameter at one angle, so as to be easily defended whilst the troops are out on patrol, has been estabbsbed near Nell's farm, at the entrance to the Waterkloof. This is at present occupied by the Rifle Brigade. And I have caused another similar camp to be estabbsbed in the centre of the Waterkloof, near Brown's farm, which is occupied by three companies of the 91st Regiment, and one company is on picquet on the summit of Mundell's Krautz, immediately above it. It is my intention also to form a small defensible post on the summit of a rock which commands Harry's Kloof and the road to Blakeway's farm, which will be occupied by Captain Lakeinan's European volunteers; and I hope that although"], [145, "119 CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. there are still some Kafirs and Hottentots who skulk and linger within recesses of the forest, and that Macomo himself is pos sibly so concealed, in a very short time it will be entirely abandoned by the enemy, and one battalion will suffice for its occupation ; and in due time, when the owners of property within and around it return to their habitations, and it becomes again frequented by woodcutters, with an efficient police to guard the approaches from the plain, it will cease to require more military protection than would be afforded by one company permanently stationed at Fort Fordyce, a work re cently constructed on the commanding summit of the Kroome Heights. The reports I have received from Major-General Yorke, as well as from other sources, prove to me that the expulsion of the Gaika Kafirs from their former territory has been almost entirely accomplished by the occupation of the three posts, the Keiskamma Hoek, Fort White, and the Temacha, and by constant patrolling from them ; but the nuisance of the Hot tentot marauders, associated under the guidance of Uithaalder, has still to be removed ; and they are said to occupy position in the western extremity of the Amatolas, not far from a mountain called the Hog's Back, a remarkable ridge leading south from Gaika's Kop, and bounding the Amatola district on the west. It is my intention, as soon as the affairs of the Waterkloof will allow me, to dispense with the services of the 73rd Re giment, which I hope will be the case in a few days' time, to form a standing camp at the foot of the Hog's Back, at a point where a mountain road leads over it into the Amatola Valley. This camp will be accessible by a good waggon road, formerly connected wttb military villages, which will enable supplies to be easily brought from Fort Hare; and I have caused twenty mules with pack-saddles, under a commissariat conductor (which is an arrangement new in this country), to be attached to the camp, for the purpose of conveying supplies to any part"], [146, "120 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S of the mountain range where troops pass. It is my intention to give to Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre, in addition to his own regiment, sufficient additional force of regular troops, with a large proportion of Fingoe levies, in order that he may dis lodge the Hottentots, and clear out that extremity of the Amatolas, should any be found to remain there. I might now almost report that the war is at an end ; but although characterised as a war, it has been, in fact, a rebellion. A war may be terminated by the surrender or capitulation of the hostile sovereign or chief, who answers for his people ; but in the suppression of a rebellion the refractory subjects of the ruling power must all be chastised and subdued. This has nearly been accomplished, and military occupation must keep them in subjection. But as it is difficult to define the origin or nature of this war, if it be considered as a war, so it is diffi cult to define the time when peace may be considered to be restored ; and although I hope ere long to settle the affairs of this frontier in as satisfactory a manner as circumstances will ever permit, the necessity for permanent mibtary occupation will only allow me to make a gradual and partial reduction in the expenditure requisite for the maintenance of the necessary military establishment. To this object, however, I have already turned my attention, and made some progress towards it, which I will not fail to continue as far as may appear to me safe and practicable.

Pakington, Bart. Fort Beaufort, September 20, 1852. Sir, \u2014 With reference to my despatch of the 28th of July, on the subject of Kaffraria, it therein stated the policy which I considered the only one open to me, with a view to bringing hostilities in that country to a satisfactory and permanent close, viz. steadily persevering in the proscription of the rebellious Gaika chiefs, and the expulsion of their clans from the Ama tolas and adjacent lands which they have hitherto possessed; and I also then stated, that as it was impossible, as well as not desirable were it possible, to exterminate that particular race, that provided they should be expelled from the land, and leave it unoccupied, my object would be so far accomplished that the important and commanding district of the Amatolas would be available for occupation by means of troops or some organ isation of colonists which might fill the vacuum with advan tage. I am happy to say that, with the exception of the rebel chiefs themselves, who yet five with a few followers in secluded re treats, the country is entirely deserted, and the people have merged into other tribes both on this and the other side of the Kei. By these measures, as well as the severe punishment lately inflicted on the paramount chief Kreili, and in a manner which I hope cannot fail to convince him of the promptness and facibty with which similar chastisement can be repeated if he should at any time give cause for it, a complete dispersion of the Gaika influence has, I believe, been accomplished, and their former territory on this side of the Kei is now so per fectly under military control, that so long as that occupation is maintained they cannot return to it. In the meantime the friendly tribes not only have continued perfectly faithful during my short absence beyond the Kei, but"], [150, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 122 since my return with the troops, on which occasion I visited King William's Town, they have evinced an increased desire to attend to the orders and suggestions of the Acting Chief Com missioner. No hostility, and, in fact, nothiDg worthy of notice, has oc curred during the last mouth in that district, beyond an occa sional highway robbery, unconnected in the slightest degree with Kaffrarian warfare ; but the band of Hottentot marauders united under the command of a notorious leader named \" Uithaalder,\" amounting to some 200 or 300, having been effectually shut out from the districts of the colony where the pobce has been established, have effected nothing, either during my absence across the Kei or since my return, beyond the cap ture of a few cattle for their own sustenance, in districts where there is as yet no police, still linger in a secluded haunt within the Amatola Mountains. I have not the slightest doubt of being able, ere long, with the means and leisure I have now at my disposal, to hunt up and disperse these enemies of the peace ; but as it is desirable that this should be accomplished as soon as possible, I have in the meantime offered a reward of \u00a3500 for Uithaalder, upon whose influence I have reason to bebeve the union of this band entirely depends. I am happy to find, however, that the rebel Hottentots and hostile Kafirs are entirely disunited, and recent occurrences wrould, I am informed, have certainly led to open hostilities between them, if the small remnant of the latter had possessed the power of resentment. In the Waterkloof the operations which are detailed in my military despatch, together with the measures I have adopted for permanent and complete occupation of that troublesome district, cannot fail to secure the lasting expulsion of all hos tile Kafirs from any established locations within the eastern boundary of the colony, and the few stragglers or marauders who may occasionally show themselves can be easily dealt with"], [151, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 123 by the police, which force has, I am happy to say, proved most efficient.

Cathcart to the Right Hon. Sir J. S. Pakington. Graham's Town, October 12, 185*2. Sir, \u2014 In my last military despatch, No. 26, dated 20th of September, 1852, I reported the clearance of the Waterkloof, and the measures I had taken for its occupation and security. I am happy to say that these measures have been attended with the successful results I anticipated, and that the Kroome district is now entirely abandoned and deserted by the enemy, and I hope for ever. In that despatch I detailed the ulterior measures I had in contemplation with respect to the clearance of the Amatolas of the band of Hottentot marauders under their leader Uithaalder, as well as of the few remaining Kafirs, who, with their chiefs Sandilli and Anta, remained secreted in the kloofs and forests of that mountainous district. The satisfactory state of things in respect to the Waterkloof, as well as the efficient services of the newly-organised police, enabled me to withdraw both the 60th and 73rd Regiments. Having on the 2nd instant assembled them near Fort Hare, together with two rocket batteries, each comuianded by an officer, a detachment of the Cape Mounted Riflemen and irre gular levies, I proceeded on the 3rd by an excellent road up the left bank of the Chumie River, a distance of about nine miles, to a convenient place for the establishment of a defen-"], [152, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 124 sible standing camp in easy communication for commissariat purposes with Fort Hare, and to serve as a proximate base for ulterior operations in the mountain district of the Amatolas. This post being immediately at the base of the declivity formed by the junction of the Seven-kloof Mountain with the Hog's Back, effectually commands and closes all communica tion between the colony and the western side of the Amatola district, and will serve for the observation of the principal passes leading into the Chumie Valley from the Kat River dis trict, an advantage which I anticipate will, by acting as a sup port in the right place, render the efficiency of the police doubly available, and I therefore contemplate some more per manent establishment at this point. Having in the meantime caused an extensive kraal, or \" ab batti enclosure,\" a hundred yards square, guarded by an en closed redoubt at one angle, to be constructed, all which was completed that evening, and having placed the commissariat supplies, spare ammunition, &c, within it, with a garrison of one company of the 2nd Regiment withdrawn from Fort Hare, I instructed Lieut.-Colonel Eyre, with a force as per margin, to commence operations the following morning before day break by ascending the Hog's Back, and to continue to peram bulate the Amatolas, passing to and fro between the newly established post at the western extremity and the Keiskamma Hoek until further orders, until this district shall be entirely cleared. Having also given to this able and enterprising officer com mand of all the troops in the Amatola district, he has at his disposal 706 rank aud file, those under the command of Lieu tenant-Colonel Skipwith, 43rd Regiment, stationed at Keis kamma Hoek, from whence that officer has also not ceased to render most efficient services ; the garrison of Fort Cox is also included in this provisional command. It appears that Uithaalder and the majority of his followers have fled from the Amatolas, and information received through"], [153, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 125 the friendly Kafirs and other sources tend to a belief that they are gone to the Witteb'ergen, a remote district near the Orange River, where they hope to evade pursuit and live on the game which is there in abundance. The Chief Sandilli, with a few followers, is still in the Ama tolas, and I leam from the friendly chiefs that he has expressed his determination not to quit it so long as he can find shelter, though strongly urged by his associates to go beyond the Kei. Macomo has also sought shelter in the Amatolas with a few followers, but cannot long remain there. The colony within the frontier bne has continued undis turbed since my last, and I have every reason to believe that the police, organisation, with the requisite military support, will provide amply for its permanent security. I enclose copy of a private note received from Lieutenant- Colonel Eyre, which contains a most satisfactory account of his proceedings up to the 7th instant ; but the diary to which he alludes, and which probably contains many interesting de tails, by some accident has not reached me. I also enclose the usual summary of military events, pre pared by the Quartermaster- General. By this report and other events which are detailed in my despatch respecting British Kaffraria you will perceive that the war of rebellion may now be considered to be at an end, and as it has been terminated on this occasion not by any compro mise or treaty but by force of arms, and that the severe moral lesson of the dispersion and expulsion of the most warlike and powerful tribe from the natural strongholds afforded by their country, and which they have long believed to he impregnable, cannot fail to impress upon all those who are conscious of their inferiority in respect to these natural advantages of the ulti mate ruin and destruction which must inevitably be the result of rebellious opposition to Her Majesty's authority, there is reason to hope that provided that authority be duly supported"], [154, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCAR's'S 126 by an adequate permanent mibtary estabbshment any similar protracted and expensive Kaffrarian warfare may be long averted. It is satisfactory to have learnt also, incidentally, through the friendly chiefs and other credible sources, that the para mount chief Kreili has been so humbled by the recent punish ment inflicted upon him, and the apparent facility with which the heavy fine was levied within his country, that he would submit to any terms imposed upon him, and that he intends to abaudon bis late chief residence, and establish a new one on the site of that formerly adopted by his father the chief Hintza, near Butterworth. It is not my intention, however, to enter into any treaty with the chief Kreili, but leave him in the wholesome belief that should he be guilty of any act of aggression, or otherwise offend, a similar heavy penalty would again be levied with equal promptness and facility. Should messengers, who, I am told, are od their way, arrive from him they will be answered to that effect. I have removed my head-quarters to this place as being more central and better adapted for business of peace, and will not fail to turn my immediate attention to measures of economy and progressive reduction of expenditure, as far as they may be consistent with the efficiency of the service and the security of the colony. I have further to request you to submit to Her Majesty my perfect satisfaction with the unabating zeal and alacrity evinced by all officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates of Her Majesty's Regular Forces, as well as the loyalty and good ser vices of the enrolled levies of European origin, as well as Fingoes, and not omitting the loyal Hottentots and their several commanders, all of whom have performed their re spective duties nobly and cheerfully under difficulties and privations of no small magnitude which are peculiar to the"], [155, ""], [156, "\u25a0 lljy John Mm lfny,18&\u00ab"], [157, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC 127 harassing and tedious warfare in which they have been em ployed.

Sir, \u2014 My military despatch of this date will put you in possession of the operations which have been carried on against the rebellious tribe of Ama-Gaika, and the success which has attended them. Yow. will observe that the great moral lesson of expulsion from their former territories has been so nearly accomplished that it only remains to hunt out one or two of the proscribed chiefs who are deserted by their followers, and compel them either to surrender at discretion or escape beyond the Kei : and the active measures which are now being carried into effect with so much energy by Lieutenant- Colonel Eyre, with the ample force at bis disposal, cannot fail to accomplish this object. Having seen the commencement of Colonel Eyre's opera tions on the 4th instant, I proceeded to King William's Town on the 5th, and on the 6th I held a meeting of all the T'Slambie chiefs which I had directed the Chief Commissioner, Colonel Maclean, to convene at Fort Murray, which is situated in the territory of the Chief Pato, about seven miles from King William's Town on the road to East London. The enclosed copy of my address, and the minute of the answers I received, will acquaint you with the satisfactory proceedings on that occasion."], [158, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 128 Whatever doubts there may at any time have been as to the loyalty and sincerity of these chiefs, there can be none now ; they are all fully sensible of the vast advantages which they now enjoy in consequence of their fidelity, so strongly con trasted with the severe but merited sufferings of the rebellious Ama-Gaikas. I was the more anxious to hold this public meeting and make known the proceedings, because certain false or exag gerated rumours appeared to be industriously circulated tend ing to throw an unjust imputation of disloyalty on the T'Slam bie tribes, and that even some of the more respectable news papers indulged in strictures which, however futile, unequivo cally tended to instigate an unjust quarrel with the friendly chiefs ; and there is but too much cause to suspect that there are persons so base and unprincipled in this community, and who have been gainers to a vast amount by war prices and extensive contracts, who would not regret that one war which had been so profitable to them should be succeeded by another, which, if unfortunately aroused, would prove possibly no less protracted and expensive than that which is now happily brought to its close. Seyolo, who is the only chief of the T'Slambie family who has been in rebellion, and who of course was not present at the general meeting, surrendered at discretion to the Chief Com missioner at Fort Murray on the 9 th instant, and is now safely lodged and securely guarded in a strong room at this place, having been immediately dispatched with a sufficient escort under the charge of Major Bisset. This chief, who throughout this rebellion has been perhaps the most active and warlike of the rebellious confederates, is half-brother to the loyal and friendly chief Siwani ; they are both sons of Dushani, who was the son of T'Slambie by his great wife, and Siwani is the son of Nonebi, the great wife of Dushani ; with her, as regent of the T'Slambies, a treaty was made, which was ratified and confirmed by His Majesty King"], [159, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 129 William the Fourth in 1837. Seyolo having now forfeited all claim to his portion of land, which adjoins that of Siwani, and extends to the northward from the road leading to Line Drift on the bank of the Keiskamma as far as the river Umdizini, I have, pending Her Majesty's approval, granted it to the chief Siwani, who is prepared to occupy it, and be answerable for the loyalty and good conduct of his people. This district is effec tually controlled by the post I have established at the Temacha ; and I have every reason to expect that the important communi cation by Line Drift will, by this measure, immediately become secure without occasion for escorts. The chief Siwani and his mother Nonebi came by invitation to meet me near the Temacha Post, where I baited to breakfast on my road to this place on the 7th instant, and from the fami liar conversation I was enabled to bold with them, through the medium of my interpreter, I derived much insight into the present affairs and impressions prevalent among the Kafir people, tending to confirm the opinions I had already formed as to the fidebty and peaceable disposition of the T'Slambies, aud, on the other hand, of the total prostration of the Gaikas and the complete dispersion of that once powerful and warlike tribe. I have it in contemplation \u2014 though I must consult my As sistant Commissioners as well as other persons capable of giving me further information before I can finally decide upon the question \u2014 to invite the friendly chief Kama, who is brother of the chief Pato, and who now resides in a country allotted to him in North Victoria, not far from Whittlesea, and hence the only remaining Kafir chief within the colonial boundary, to remove with his people into the country heretofore occupied by the rebel chief Stock, and I have reason to believe he would be willing to do so. This country would join that now appor tioned to Siwani at the river Umdizini, and would fill up the remaining portion of the country on the Kaffrarian side of the border with faithful and friendly Kafirs, in its whole extent K"], [160, "130 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S from the sea to the base of the Amatolas. This chief is not only said to be the sobtary instance of a Kafir having sincerely embraced Christianity, but has been doing good service in defence of the northern districts, with his people regularly enrolled as a levy, in which his sons held the rank of officers. I asked Siwani how be would like to have Kama for a neigh bour. He said that he was a good man, and that his people were good men ; that he should like to have him for a neigh bour, for if he had a bad one, his own people would be liable to blame for the misdeeds committed by others ; and that on occasion of a former war, during his minority, he had been sent to reside with Kama, to be out of the way, and that he respected him as a father. This belt of territory does not extend to a greater breadth than some 10 or 12 miles, and there will remain the fertile dis tricts of the Amatolas and Kabousie, as well as other lands stretching down to King William's Town, which constitute the forfeited Gaika territory, now untenanted, and in mibtary occu pation, which might serve for colonisation, if the means of providing for that object should hereafter be found ; and the districts to which I have alluded would suffice for the absorp tion of the increased numbers of the followers of the faithful chiefs, which must unavoidably result from the expulsion and dispersion of the Gaikas, even though the greater body should have preceded or be disposed to follow their leaders across the Kei. As resulting from these measures, I hope ere long to be able to report that the designation of Ama Gaika has ceased to be known in British Kaffraria, excepting as a memento of the severe but just retribution which has fallen upon a rebellious race, and as a warning to those who now live in prosperity and peace under British rule not to allow themselves on slight grounds to be led into unavailing rebellion, and thereby inevi tably sacrifice the blessings which they enjoy. Unless breach of faith, injustice, or undue severity on the part of their rulers should render the alternative one of desperation, \u2014 a case which,"], [161, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 131 under British rule, I trust can never occur, \u2014 or that the insti gations and intrigues of mischievous or designing persons should be suffered to prevail, I see no reason to apprehend a possibility of the recurrence of another Kaffrarian frontier war or rebellion, which good government, supported by a moderate but sufficient mibtary establishment, may not suffice to smother in its birth. Since closing the above I have received from Colonel Mac lean, in a letter brought to me by the opportunity of Seyolo's escort, information to the effect that there are messengers already near Fort Murray coming from the chief Kreili with a voluntary first instalment of cattle as a tribute in compensation for the destruction of the missionary station at Butterworth in 1851. This is a tardy fulfilment of an agreement entered into with my predecessor, with which a subsequent refusal to comply when it was demanded of him by me, formed, as you are already aware, a part of the \" casus belli \" which induced me to invade his territory. This is so far satisfactory that it fur nishes an additional proof that the recent Trans-Keian expedi tion has not been without its fruits, and that the policy I have adopted of abstaining from any parley upon the subject has had the wholesome effect of keeping this neighbouring inde pendent chief in awe and suspense as to any ulterior intentions I might have of repeating an infliction which he is now fully aware he would be unable to resist, and thus it is manifest that the powerful moral influence of the acknowledged paramount head of the great Amakosa family is now under complete control.

Cathcart to Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies. Graham's Town, November 14, 1852. Sir, \u2014 In my confidential despatch, marked No. 34, of this date, I have confined myself to the question still pending, as to whether the sovereignty of the Orange River territory should continue to be maintained or not. In this, however, irrespec tive of that political question, I consider it my duty to inform you of the actual state of things among the native tribes, and the measures I feel imperatively called upon to adopt in con sequence, without loss of time. It is probably already known to you, that whilst certain emigrants of European race, chiefly of Dutch extraction, and commonly designated Boers, were gradually establishing them selves in certain parts of the country now comprised in the Orange River territories, and by means and under circum stances which it is not necessary here to consider were obtain ing the position in which Sir G. Napier found them in the year 1843, native tribes, too numerous and various to be worth recounting, had been for some years past and were still busily engaged in carrying on intestine feuds of more than ordi nary rancour, and, as it is described in their own language, eating each other up \u2014 an expression even then not merely metaphorical, as some of them are said to have been cannibals. Precise dates are difficult to ascertain in such a state of society ; but I assert these facts on the authority of Monsieur Arbousset, a French missionary, who at this time is one of the principal advisers of the chief Moshesh, residing with him, and who has published an interesting book, printed in Paris. The events to which I allude occurred during the lifetime of the chief Moshesh, and probably took place within the last thirty years. It appears from the above authorities, corroborated also by"], [168, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 138 oral testimony which I have obtained, that Moshesh, who in his youth was but a son of an inferior chieftain of an inferior tribe, by his own energy and enterprise, supported by good for tune, managed ultimately, out of the wreck of petty nations, to become a centre of aggregation, and to establish a powerful Sovereignty, selecting a well-chosen and defensible mountain fastness, \" Thaba Bossiou,\" as his seat of government. The French missionaries were not slow to recognise the power and comparative prospect of stability of this new sove reign power, and the superiority of the chief who had assumed it; they accordingly established their station at the foot of the mountain on which Moshesh had placed his citadel. The same shrewd judgment which probably gained the suc cess of the chief soon revealed to him also the policy of avail ing himself of the counsels of these pious and enlightened men, so manifestly his dependants, and bound by common interest to assist him in maintaining his position. He appears accordingly to have consulted and made use of them on all occasions in his relations with the British power, which at that time first extended its influence and interference beyond the Orange River. Monsieur Arbousset, it appears, fully admits that the in structions to the French Missionary Society prohibit the inter ference of their fraternity in matters of policy, and indeed I can scarcely find proof of any malignant meddling on their part, or more iuterference than may perhaps be excused by the cogent motive of self-interest, perhaps self-preservation, arisiug from their critical position; but that circumstance has rendered them most artful and able counsellors, and I think it is mani fest that on more occasions than one they have obtained for this successful adventurer an influence and power against which the ill-supported authority of the British Resident is inadequate to contend. So plausible are the excuses for the acts of aggression com mitted by his people against his neighbours, and so ably set"], [169, "CORRESPONDENCE ON kaffraria, etc. 139 forth are instances of his forbearance and moderation, that there is scarcely anything tangible as a cause of quarrel. The British Resident stands in the position in which he is placed by the proclamation of Sovereignty, as well as by a sort of treaty signed by Governor Sir H. Smith and the chief Moshesh, and to which the other native chiefs are parties, which preceded the proclamation by about a week, and has been subsequently acted upon and held to be in force. His position is that of arbitrator in cases of disputes respecting boundaries, robberies, and reprisals, between the native chiefs who signed the treaty. Instances of contempt of this autho rity, which are of frequent occurrence, must under existing circumstances often be unavoidably submitted to or allowed to pass unnoticed, for the only course which the Resident can adopt in support of his authority is to hold \"in terrorem\" the possibility of the arrival of a sufficient force of Her Ma jesty's troops in the Sovereignty if called for to maintain it. In the meantime the native chiefs have been induced to be lieve, that, owing to the Kaffrarian rebellion, the troops are so fully occupied in this distant portion of Her Majesty's South African dominions that the possibibty of their arrival in the Sovereignty was a remote contingency, if not an empty threat ; and indeed as the largest British force that ever crossed the Orano-e River did not amount to 600 men, although it sufficed for the immediate purpose of the Burgher commando of Pre torius, and had not to contend with any of the native tribes, it was not calculated, from the smallness of its numbers, to leave a sufficient impression as to the power of the British nation among those who had no opportunity of feeling it. It is but just to admit that, from the earliest period of any official recognition or even knowledge of the chief Moshesh as the paramount ruler of the Basuto tribe, that chief, though engaged in constant quarrels with his neighbours, never came into collision with Her Majesty's troops, but, on the contrary, refused solicitations to join the Boers in their rcbelbon which"], [170, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 140 was terminated by the battle of \" Boom Plaats,\" and his con duct on that occasion was duly acknowledged as that of a faithful ally. But you are aware since that event, impatient under the inability in which Major Warden, the late Resident, found himself placed as to the enforcement of his authority as arbitrator, he, with the approval of my predecessor, took occa sion of some recent forays and reprisals which had occurred, to call upon some comparatively weak native auxiliaries and cer tain loyal burghers for co-operation in support of the feeble escort of the regular troops, only calculated for the protection of bis person, and with this inadequate force commenced a little war against the great chief; the result was, as might have been expected, humibating, and has unfortunately left a dis advantageous impression in that quarter as to the real power of the British nation. Her Majesty's Assistant Commissioners, the late Major Hogge and Mr. Owen, visited Moshesh at his great place at \" Thaba Bossiou,\" and in their official capacity, considering it their duty to call that chief to account for certain reprisals or captures of cattle which he had inflicted, avowedly as a punish ment upon those Boers aud minor native chieftains who had joined Major Warden, the Queen's vicegerent, in -hostility to him, they drew out a document, a copy of which is enclosed, demanding reparation, which Moshesh assented to and signed ; and their official capacity and special mission on that occasion appears to have had some temporary influence in restoring respect for Her Majesty's authority, if not for that of the Resident. It is to be regretted that the terms of the demand then made and subscribed to were so vaguely worded, no precise amount of fine having been named, that not only were they open to evasion, but scarcely capable of being complied with without engendering fresh disputes and difficulties between the parties with whom it was desired that an equitable adjustment should be made, and consequently the chief Moshesh has only par-"], [171, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC 141 tially fulfilled his engagement, and either evades or declines the settlement of those claims which remain. On the 2nd March, 1852, about a month previously to my arrival at the Cape, Mr. Assistant Commissioner Owen, being in the Orange River territory, made a renewed official demand, a copy of which is enclosed, for a settlement of the remaining claims ; and on my arrival at King William's Town, at the suggestion of the Assistant Commissioners I wrote a letter to the chief Moshesh, announcing the assumption of my govern ment, adverting to the necessity for the settlement of this ques tion, and declaring my intention to visit the Sovereignty as soon as the war in which I was engaged should be brought to a close, on which occasion I hoped to meet him as a friend, and actuated by feebngs of loyalty towards the Government, for which, until the late unhappy troubles arose, he had been so uniformly distinguished. To this I received a polite reply, evidently the composition of the French missionaries, but signed by David Moshesh, the chief's son, on behalf of his father, copies of which correspondence accompanied my de spatches on the affairs of the Orange River sovereignty of the 20th May, 1852, No. 2, and 21st July, 1852, No. 16, but the claims remain unsettled. Some extracts from recent reports made to me by the pre sent Resident will show that the same unfortunate state of things in respect to plunder and reprisals between Moshesh and his neighbours still prevails, and in such cases it is often difficult, at this distance, to judge on which side the primary aggression, of which reciprocal reprisals are the natural result, may be considered to have originated ; and though these cases are not more alarming than such as have been of constant oc currence for many years past, so convinced am I that Her Majesty being supposed to have undertaken to administer justice to all classes of Her subjects within the Orange River territory, as well as intervention and arbitration between native chiefs, it is my imperative duty to proceed thither without loss"], [172, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 142 of time, now that I can leave this portion of the frontier in security, and on my arrival in that country administer strict justice with a strong arm, in vindication of the sovereign honour and authority. Whatever may be the policy ultimately adopted with respect to the retaining or abandoning the Sovereignty, British autho rity having once been asserted, it could neither be retained nor abandoned with honour in the present unsatisfactory state of tilings. I have been obliged to trouble you thus at some length with the grounds upon which I have decided to move without delay, and concentrate 2,000 men of the force under my command at Smithfield on the Caledon River, by the end of this mouth. The measure may no doubt disappoint and possibly alarm those who imagine that my duties and responsibilities, and the difficulties which have still to be overcome, before peace can be established on a secure and permanent basis, are confined to the eastern frontier of the colony, and what is commonly called the Kafir war. These, I hope, have now been provided for in a satisfactory manner. The object, however, of this in tended expedition is not necessarily for war, but for the esta blishment of peace ; and as I have given timely notice to the commissariat, with instructions to form ample magazines, by supplies drawn through contractors in the adjacent districts at Whittlesea, Burghers Dorp, and Smithfield, the cost of trans port will, I have reason to hope, scarcely exceed that which would be incurred by the same force in stationary quarters, whilst the march of the troops, compared to their recent un paralleled fatigues and exertions, will prove, I hope, a gradual and healthful relaxation, far preferable to an immediate transi tion from most active service to complete repose. The duty which calls for my presence in the Sovereignty I consider to be, \u2014 first, after due investigation on the spot, to fix and define the equitable amount of compensation due by the chief Moshesh, and exact, and if necessary compel, prompt"], [173, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 143 payment ; secondly, to adjust all other claims which may be submitted to me, not only as to boundaries between chiefs, and compensation for their mutual reprisals, but the more import ant questions which remain unsettled between the Boers and Griquas, subjects of the chief Adam Kok ; thirdly, to declare certain definite fines, as cautionary penalties for the infringe ment of such injunctions as I may see cause to leave, in order to guard against future irregularities, and in support of the authority of the Resident ; and when I have by my coming convinced the native chiefs and others that the British Govern ment has the power and sooner or later will enforce the pay ment of such penalties they will possibly be respected. In m\"y endeavour to perform this duty with strict justice and in a lasting manner, I shall avail myself of the able counsels of my two Assistant Commissioners, who, as well as the Resident, will meet me on the Caledon River. Whilst so engaged, though studiously avoiding any unjustifiable or unauthorised provoca tion of hostilities, I shall be prepared to assert Her Majesty's authority by force of arms, if need be. Should I have occasion to resort to hostilities, what I may have to do I hope to accomplish with Her Majesty's troops, and not to allow the weaker native powers, or Burghers, or Griquas, to interfere, and avail themselves of a plea of loyalty, in the real hopes of being aided and abetted and supported by sufficient force in destroying and plundering their more power ful and wealthy neighbour. I am aware that my predecessor has been said to have con quered the whole Orange River territory with a force little exceeding 500 men, which was all he could at that moment detach from other services. Great merit is due to the accom- plishment of great ends with small means, but so small a dis play is not calculated to restore an adequate respect for the power and means of the British Government, and therefore I hope that this new expedition in which I am about to embark"], [174, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 144 will meet with the approval of Her Majesty's Government, and that it will prove the last. I have, &c, (Signed) Geo. Cathcart, Governor. The Right Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies, &c. &c. Copy of a Despatch from Governor the Hon. G. Cath- cart to the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies, &c. Graham's Town, November 14, 1852. Sir, \u2014 In this, on the subject of the affairs of British Kaf fraria, I have little more to communicate than what my former despatch may have led you to anticipate. The unparalleled exertions of Lieutenant- Colonel Eyre, to whom I had entrusted a sufficient force, with orders to peram bulate the Amatolas, after a series of active movements, which are detailed in my military despatch, have, with the co-opera tion of Major-General Yorke, effectually accompbshed the expulsion of the Gaika race from the district which they for merly inhabited, as well as the entire dispersion of the band of robbers hitherto united under the command of the rebel Hot tentot leader \" Uithaalder.\" The inclosed deposition of one of the gang who has recently surrendered, which is confirmed by all reports I have received, as well as other similar concurrent depositions of prisoners, will give a more satisfactory description of the state to which these rebels have been reduced than any further statement I could make. It becomes now a question of the greatest importance how to secure the advantage which has been gained. With this view I have had recourse to an immediate though provisional"], [175, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 145 expedient, which, without compromising any other policy that may be deemed preferable, cannot fail to serve as a salutary foundation. This system, which will be more fully explained in the in closed printed copy of a letter to the Commanding Royal Engineer, is the occupation of the forfeited Gaika territory, pending Her Majesty's pleasure, to be considered as a royal forest. Within it I have selected certain points, chosen on strategic principles for defensibility, and commanding all parts of the district, and at the same time possessing those advan tages in respect to good land and command of water which render them eligible as sites for suture villages. The success which has already attended the formation of the garrison town of King William's Town, as a provisional arrangement, under the peculiar circumstances of this part of Her Majesty's domi nions, gives me great hopes that the same system carried out will tend to the accomplishment of the desired object in this Gaika district, namely, that of permanent occupation. Although the Gaikas have been driven out of their territory, and the greater part have gone beyond the Kei, the Chiefs San dilli and Macomo, each with some eight or ten faithful followers, are still lurking in hiding-places within the Amatola range of mountains, and though they have had repeated hair-breadth escapes have not yet been captured. The schedule I received this day from the Chief Commis sioner, Colonel Maclean, has the following entry : \" Received an indirect message from Sandilli and Macomo, from Gobo of Jan Tzatzoe's tribe, to know whether the chiefs would be par doned if they apprehended Uithaalder, or any of the rebel Hottentot leaders, or Umlanjeni.\" The answer, of course, will be, no terms but unconditional surrender, or to go beyond the Kei ; but that in case of sur render their lives will be spared. I may here remark that, under any circumstances, the im prisonment of a chief gives more advantageous power over his L"], [176, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 146 tribe than the example of capital punishment ; because, accord ing to their laws, so long as he lives, be it even in captivity, they cannot appoint a successor, and the tribe is subject to the government of a feeble or disputed regency. I infer from the above communication that these chiefs must immediately decide upon going beyond the Kei or surrendering, or otherwise they must inevitably starve, or sooner or later fall into our hands. In my last despatch I reported, as the consequence of the recent expedition beyond the Kei, that I had information that the Chief Kreili sent messengers to Fort Murray, who were on their road with the first instalment of cattle, as a compensation for the destruction of the missionary station at Butterworth, in 1851, in fulfilment of the agreement entered into with my pre decessor, with which a subsequent refusal to comply, when it was demanded of him by me, formed part of the grounds on which I invaded his territory. This small first instalment arrived, and was shortly followed by three messengers with a further instalment, and the object of whose mission is detailed in the inclosed deposition. 'My answer was, that the 1500 head of cattle must be paid, and then I shall be glad to make peace with the chief Kreili, and send a Resident to be with him. The terms of that peace will be, to re-open the trade through bis country, and to require of him the full exercise of his legitimate power as paramount chief in the prevention of any annoyance from the Gaika tribes. I am happy to say that the conduct of the T'Slambie chiefs and of their people continues to be in every respect most satis factory, aud indeed, under existing circumstances, the manifest advantages which they enjoy, as the consequence of their adherence to their allegiance, is sufficient security for their fidelity. The Chief Umbala, whose conduct appeared to he ambiguous at one period of the contest, is now most anxious to manifest his loyalty ; but he is often put to difficulties by"], [177, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 147 Gaika refugees endeavouring to find an asylum in his country, which extends nearly from the Buffalo to the Kei, the Kei road forming its northern boundary in its whole extent. In such cases, however, where he thinks his loyalty might be compro mised, he now hastens to consult Colonel Maclean, and, I be lieve, conceals nothing from him. Colonel Maclean, knowing so intimately the circumstances of the case, exercises that judgment which he so peculiarly possesses in adapting his advice or injunctions to the practical circumstances of the case. He demands expulsion of refugees in cases where necessary, but does not fretfully and vexatiously insist upon it in cases of no importance. The rights of hospitality claimed by relations cannot fail to obtain an asylum for some stray members of the Gaika tribe within this territory, but this circumstance cannot entail any permanent consequences, for hospitality even among brothers has its bmits, and those in the territory of Umhala, when they feel themselves crowded to excess, will request their guests to move on across the Kei, and provide for themselves. It is necessary that I should dwell on this subject more than I should otherwise have done, because there are certain persons within the colony who maintain that I shall have done nothing effectually unless I root out, or hunt out, every member who formerly may have belonged to the Gaika tribe, but who may have found a temporary shelter with his relations in the T'Slambie districts. The people who advocate these imprac ticable notions I had hitherto considered to be confined to those who have largely gained by the war, and who would not be sorry if their sources of income should be extended by the commencement of another Kafir war, which the irritation occa sioned by an attempt to hunt out these refugees among our present friends the T'Slambies would inevitably produce. I am not, however, easily diverted from the course which I con sider the right one ; and I will rather trust to the good faith of the T'Slambie chiefs, who have given me no cause to distrust L 2"], [178, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 148 them, who hold themselves responsible for all who live within their territories, than risk the commencement of a new war, in the pursuit of an object which appears to me equally frivolous, unjust, and impracticable. I enclose a sort of protest on the subject addressed to me by Mr. Assistant Commissioner Owen, who was absent on a mis sion for the settlement of the Tambookie question at the time that I addressed the T'Slambie chiefs, and who, I find, in common with some of the colonial journals, is not satisfied with my course of conduct in this respect, which I am sorry for. Before leaving Graham's Town for the Orange River, I thought it desirable to subject the chief Seyolo, who is a pri soner at this place, to proceedings by general court-martial, which process is necessary to enable me to avail myself of a colonial legislative enactment of 11th November, 1851, enti tled, \" Ordinance to provide for the imprisonment of certain criminals sentenced by courts-martial,\" and by which it is made lawful to carry such sentences into effect at any convict sta tion within the colony that the Governor may appoint, even though such station be situated in a district not under martial law. It is my intention to send this prisoner by the first opportu nity to Cape Town, in order that all expectation of bis being pardoned and released may cease, and his former dependants, who I learn from the Chief Commissioner are daily coming in and delivering up their arms, become settled, and reconciled to the superiority of their present legitimate and responsible chief Siwani, as well as to provide for better security against his escape. A copy of the charge and sentence is enclosed. I have, &c, (Signed) Geo. Cathcart, Governor, and High Commissioner."], [179, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 149 Letter to the Commanding Royal Engineer at Cape Town. Head- Quarters, Graham's Town, November 5, 1852. Sir, \u2014 You are aware that, as regards that part of Her Ma jesty's South African possessions designated British Kaffraria, Her Majesty's Government recognise the necessity for its admi nistration being, for the present, based upon the principles of martial law in the full sense of that term, and distinct from any colonial interference. I have to request that you will at all times inform me, with out reserve, of every occasion on which you may consider that I am acting at variance with any Ordnance Regulations ; for, although necessity, arising from peculiar circumstances in this Government and command, may obbge me to depart from them occasionally, I wish on such occasions to report to the proper authorities my reasons for such departure from them, it being my earnest desire, not only to conform as nearly as cir cumstances will admit, but ultimately, and as soon as possible, to reduce the system to strict rule, even to the most clear defi nition of what is to be considered, as it is commonly called, \" Ordnance property.\" I now therefore think it necessary, not only for the informa tion of the head of your department, but for the guidance of the officers under your command, that I should acquaint you with the policy I intend to adopt in respect to the provisional but immediate occupation of the Gaika territory, in which the great moral lesson of the total expulsion of the whole rebel lious race which formerly inhabited it has now been accom plished. Possession of that territory has been obtained by securing the advantages gained by unparalleled exertions of Her Majes ty's troops, by means of the progressive establishment of tem porary enclosures, having a defensible redoubt in one angle, in which the armed servants and non-combatants suffice for the"], [180, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 150 protection of the standing camp in perfect security, whilst all the combatants have been available for active duty. Three permanent works in the right place, viz., the Temacha, Keiskamma Hoek, and Line Drift have already been con structed on this principle, and incalculable advantages have resulted from them ; and although the numerous other posts are for the present merely field-works, equal advantages have resulted from them. Experience will show whether all are necessary, or whether they might not be better placed ; but it is my intention, in due time, to require permanent posts on the construction which experience may also show to be the most appropriate to pecu liar circumstances as well as to locality. The objects of these posts will not be merely military defen sibility, but to serve as the centres of villages, capable of con tributing largely, if not entirely, to their own future security and defensibility. Around each of these military posts in British Kaffraria, which, as you are aware, is not a colony as yet, but an exclu sively native district, I reserve a rayon of two miles, more or less ; but in laying this out I have directed the Chief Commis sioner of British Kaffraria to arrange with the native chiefs a boundary, not theoretical, and as described by the compasses on a map, but according to certain natural features of ground intelligible to all parties ; and these must be marked on plans made for the purpose, in every instance in duplicate, one copy to be signed by me, which will be given to the Chief Commis sioner. This applies not only to those posts which are situated in the territories of native chiefs who are loyal and in possession of their undisputed rights, but also to those in the newly-acquired Gaika country, of which the Chief Sandilb has been dispos sessed. It is my intention, subject to Her Majesty's approval, to constitute the whole of this district a royal forest. In it, how-"], [181, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 151 ever, will be several mibtary stations appointed with rayons circumscribed of two miles radius, more or less, according to convenience and natural demarcations. I am not prepared at once and immediately to declare how much of the areas is to be considered Ordnance property ; and it would be inconvenient to moot that question prematurely at starting ; but an area around the central keep, which I intend invariably to reserve for defensible purposes and as a place d'armes, as also a place of refuge in case of sudden alarm, and all ground occupied by troops who have regularly hutted them selves according to plans laid down and approved by officers of the Royal Engineers, which I invariably insist upon, I will at once declare Ordnance property. With a view to forming a wholesome organisation and system for any future arrangements which may be made for the occu pation of this territory, from which the former inhabitants have been expelled, and to which, if not immediately occupied, they will strive to return, I mean in the area of the circumference having a two-mile radius of each post, to sanction, under the management of the Chief Commissioner of British Kaffraria, the settlement by colonists, with provisional titles, and with a clear understanding that the tenure is subject to all chances, and without claim for compensation under any circumstances, according to the same rules which now prevail at King Wil liam's Town. These colonists may be allowed the use but not the right of commonage in the royal forest as regards pasture and firewood ; but as to cutting timber, they must pay for their licence, according to such rules and regulations as may be found expedient. No out-dwellers or squatters will be permitted, but all must reside within an appointed rayon at some established post. Now, to ensure all things being done in order, and as much depends upon the first laying out of a future town or village, I have already issued a general order that no building erected within a mibtary rayon of any of these new posts shall be"], [182, "152 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S allowed to \"stand, unless the owners can produce a written sanction, signed by an officer of Royal Engineers of the command ; and I have to request you, therefore, to communi cate the whole of this policy to all the officers of Royal Engi neers under your command, with which view I send you printed copies of these instructions, for circulation to them, in order that I may derive the full benefit of that assistance which they are so capable of affording. I intend also to impart the sub stance of this letter to the Chief Commissioner of British Kaffraria, and all whom it may concern. That the officers of Royal Engineers may clearly understand what I ask of them, you will be pleased to explain to them that what I wish them to bear in mind, with a view to the public service in a most essential matter, is not merely the defensi bility of an apparently insignificant military post, but the nucleus upon which some future town is perhaps to be formed, and therefore to take into consideration all the advantages which its position and circumstances can afford for convenience, without losing sight of security and defensibility against Kafir inroads. To illustrate my meaning, I would say that, for instance, even in the selection of a burying ground, \u2014 as there are gene rally in all colonial communities, however small, various sects which require separate places of interment, \u2014 if the sites granted for these purposes be judiciously selected and allotted, at first in the outskirts, when they come in due time to be enclosed with stone walls they may be found so disposed as to become a system of defensible redoubts ; but if no forethought be exer cised in the selection of these places,- they are apt, when the village has grown to be a town, to be found to be placed in the most inconvenient situation, and cannot then be got rid of. Even the site of a cattle kraal ought not to be left to chance. In all these arrangements, however, I desire that the Chief Commissioner should have the control which is inseparable from his high responsibilities in the government of the district"], [183, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 153 of British Kaffraria ; but I trust to the wilbng aid, advice, and co-operation of all officers of your department, and espe cially in matters of detail, even though they be not exclusively of a military character.

Sir, \u2014 As I reported in my last mibtary despatch that the war of rebellion might then be considered to be at an end, I have nothing to communicate in this, further than the very active and energetic operations of Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre in perambulating the Amatolas, and hunting out the remaining Kafirs and Hottentots who still lingered in its kloofs and forests ; whilst at the same time Major-General Yorke person ally superintended similar operations in that part of his district of British Kaffraria formerly occupied by the tribes of Stock, Tola, and Seyolo. In this extensive tract of forest country from which the Gaika race has been expelled, and which, by means of the military posts marked on the enclosed plan, each occupied in sufficient force to admit of constant patrols from them, Her Majesty's troops can now completely command, there will, nevertheless, remain a few stragglers for some time to come ; but the duty of the troops in respect to them has become en tirely that of police, and the consequences of rebellion must take some little time to subside before the powers of Govern ment can recover their full energies, and entirely prevent oc-"], [184, "THE HON.

Within the colonial boundary, the same return to a state of comparative security and tranquillity has followed the clear ance of the Waterkloof, and the expulsion of the Gaikas, the surrender of Seyolo, and the submission of the paramount chief Kreili. Within the colony, I have gradually withdrawn the troops from detached police duties, and concentrated them in their proper places, as far as I can ; and I find that, with the benefit of prompt and immediate support and assistance from Her Majesty's troops, whenever required, the police force has taken admirably to the duties which properly belong to them, and for which they are far better adapted than troops under a more military system of organisation and restraint can ever be, and they have already proved quite competent to deal with the marauders and fugitives from justice, who must for a time in fest the woods and kloofs, and strive to steal for their subsist ence ; but so effectual and severe have been the punishment inflicted on these evil-doers of late by the police, that there are but few who now dare show themselves within the colony.

In this letter I would advert more particularly to the occu pation of the country recently forfeited by those Tambookius who were most deeply implicated in the recent rebellion, espe cially the lands of the late Chief Mapassa, which were always too extensive for the tribe, and never adequately occupied, and * See No. 51, in Blue Book, page 223\u2014 in this Volume, page 18."], [187, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 157 now, since that tribe has been entirely dispersed, and the chief tainship extinct, the remnant, if not compelled to place them selves under the responsible rule of other recognised Tam bookie chiefs possessed of land, and now returned to their duty, which they have declared their willingness to do, would con tinue to be a most dangerous and lawless banditti, and there not being sufficient regular troops available to check them, the necessity for continuing a large force of colonial levies in North Victoria, which I am about to reduce, would be perma nent and indispensable.

I have appointed a provisional land commission (as named in the margin*) to select and recommend in the first place a site for a village, with the advantages of water and capabibties of irrigation; these are requisites generally as difficult to be found as they are indispensable in this arid country, but a place has already been suggested which is likely to answer the purpose, on the Bush or Komane River, only 20 miles in ad vance of the present occupied line, and as soon as I am satis fied that there are sufficient applicants for lots or 'erven' of half an acre, in this village or future town, and that the whole has been laid out and surveyed with a commonage or town land of two miles radius reserved for it, no time shall be lost in forming the settlement. It is necessary to bear in mind that this land, proposed to \u00bb President: H. Calderwood, Esq., Commissioner of Victoria. Members : M. Robinson, Esq., Assistant Surveyor-General ; N.

SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 158 be settled, is already within the colonial boundary, and no new acquisition of territory. As soon as the new town, which I propose to call Queens ton, is well in progress, I would ask leave to depart from a stringent general rule laid down in my instructions, in respect to grants of land as farms (which are thereby ordered to be invariably put up to auction), in the settlement of this portion of land situated within the colony, recently forfeited, by rebel Tambookies, because that mode of proceeding, though founded on theory and made generally applicable in all cases in all colonies, would entirely defeat my object, of immediate and simultaneous occupation by a sufficiently dense population for mutual support. If the lands were put up to auction in this case, the greater part would, as heretofore, fall into the hands of land jobbers, and would remain unoccupied, whilst the numerous applicants who are now ready at once to come into occupation, both burghers and Englishmen of the sort we want and can obtain, would not only be unwilling to wait for the chance, or to enter into competition as purchasers, and thereby the opportunity would be lost, but they would be unable in many cases to find the money to compete with speculators who would, secure all the best places. I propose, therefore, that the farms should be granted on quit rent, and that, whereas, according to a most pernicious and ruinous custom which has hitherto prevailed in this coun try of granting farms of 6,000 acres, an old Dutch custom, which is the ruin of the colony, whereby it generally happens that the dwellings are ten or fifteen miles asunder, and the country appears depopulated and entirely neglected, I intend to sanction no farm of greater extent than 3000 acres when almost entirely pastoral, or 2000 acres where a portion may be fit for agriculture, and these I propose to grant only in the first instance in the immediate vicinity of the new town and"], [189, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 159 behind it, that is, between it and the country already in occu pation, until that portion be sufficiently filled up. The applications for land on the above terms, in the place which I consider most desirable should, on the principle stated in the commencement of this despatch, be immediately occu pied, have poured in upon me from all directions during my present passage through these northern districts, from men admirably adapted for the purpose. These I have referred to the investigation and consideration of the above-mentioned commission, which is to meet at Whittlesea, and who will also inquire into all circumstances connected with a project, of which I enclose a copy, drawn up by Mr. Bowker, a resident in North Victoria, and if it be practicable, I have decided to take upon myself the responsibibty of departing from the letter of my instructions in respect to sale by auction in this instance, which is confined to a part of the land within the colonial boundary, from which the rebel Tambookies have been ex pelled, as the only means in my power of securing the per manency of the peace which has been so recently restored, I hope in an equitable manner, and, as far as I can judge, to the satisfaction of Tambookies as well as colonists. Should this measure be approved and sanctioned, under the circumstances of the case I should wish a similar latitude to be granted in respect of the whole frontier district of Victoria ; I would also wish the exception to to the piece of country known as the Kat River Settlement, the focus of Hot tentot rebellion, for if when the lands become forfeited and disposable by legal process they must be put up to auction, I have reason to believe there is already a combination on foot to buy up these lots, and re-establish an exclusively Hottentot location, which has proved so dangerous as well as unprofit able an experiment. But if I am enabled to dispose of them by grants or payment of the usual upset prices, without having recourse to sale by auction, I could mix the community with white settlers, who might improve by their exertions and their"], [190, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 160 example a country which now much resembles the garden of the sluggard, but which possesses agricultural capabilities of rare occurrence in this country. Connected with this subject, and with the same view of esta blishing a more condensed population, and more popular in ducement to immediate occupation, I would recommend that that part of British Kaffraria north of the Amatolas called the Windvogel-berg country, formerly supposed to be occupied by Mapassa, but whose followers never sufficed for the purpose, should, now that it is forfeited and entirely vacated, be given over to the colony, to become part of the district of Victoria, and as it adjoins the Tambookies' forfeited land, adverted to above, it should be colonised on the same principle. This I have no reason to doubt would be in that manner almost im mediately accomplished, and this would give a burgher popu lation capable of self-protection in that quarter, which is now deserted. There would then remain under the Chief Commissioner of British Kaffraria only the Gaika forfeited lands, including the Amatolas under military occupation, and the faithful T'Slambie tribes. If I be authorised to carry out these measures, I feel confi dent of being able to establish a lasting peace, as regards the colonial frontier, and with comparatively reduced expense of military establishment; but unless the vacuum caused by the expulsion of rebellious Aborigines be immediately and suffi ciently filled up, they will return and strive to recover occu pation, either by constant fretful attempts or by a renewed Kafir war as soon as they have recovered from the effects of this. Another most satisfactory result of this measure would be, not only the encouragement of the Dutch settlers to remain in the colony, but possibly an attraction to others to return.

The Magistrate of the district will refer to the Governor before he can have authority to enforce the forfeiture of the lands of such parties as refuse to perform the original condi tions relative to the defence. 8. The farms to be granted free, without charges, on a per petual and inalienable quit-rent, averaging about \u00a310 per farm, or \u00a3o for each one thousand acres of land per annum, the title of each to be simple, and to be furnished by the surveyors or Land Commission, and registered by the Magistrate of the district. 9.

The Field Cornets to take especial care that their respec tive men be ready to turn out, in aid of the rural police, when ever required. 16. All occupants of farms to give notice to the Field Comets of their temporary absence to market, or for supplies, or other business. 17. The men to whom the new farms will be given to have the recommendation of the Magistrates of their respective districts. 18. The stock possessed by the new occupants will neces sarily be not very numerous, which will enable many, who are friends, relations, or acquaintances, to live for the first few years in little communities, as is frequently the case in the colony, upon an understanding amongst themselves, and the whole of the farms would thus become occupied by degrees. These arrangements will take place amongst the people them selves, if occasion requires them. 19. With the exception of the defensive regulations upon which these farms shall be held, all other things would be con formable to the colonial law. 20.

The second, composed of three companies of the 43rd, three of the 73rd, and one of the Rifle Brigade, commanded by Major Pinckney of the 73rd, and Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre, is in command of this nominal division of infantry; and the requisite portion of cavalry to act with it, when necessary, will be attached ; but in the meantime the whole management of horses, as far as possible, is better in the hands of a cavalry officer, who will in any event retain a considerable proportion of cavalry united force in the country, which is peculiarly adapted to its operations. A rocket battery carried on mules is attached to each brigade. The floating indian-rubher bridge is in charge of Lieutenant Siborne of the Royal Engineers ; and Lieutenant Stauton, R.E., is in command of a detachment of twenty Royal Sappers and Miners. Lieutenant- Colonel Napier, with the cavalry, marched yester day, the 28th, to a place half way to the Orange River, and was to arrive on its banks to-day ; and as the ford is reported to be in a very favourable state, be may probably pass it with his forage waggons to-day. Next day he is instructed to move on towards the Caledon River, and cross it, and encamp on the other side on the 2nd December. Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre moved off with the second brigade this morning to take the some route, and Lieutenant-Colonel MacDuff will follow with the first brigade to-morrow, each at a day's interval. I intend to march with my head-quarters and cavalry escort to-night, and gain the bead of the column as soon as I can, having been necessarily detained here by important colonial business. It is my intention then to form a standing camp of the whole"], [196, "166 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S force on the right bank of the Caledon, the upper drift, and about ten miles from Smithfield, by an excellent road. At Smithfield a very sufficient commissariat magazine has heen established, between which and the camp the commissariat mule waggons employed for carrying tents will constantly ply ; and till my arrival the burgher force of the field cometcy has been called out for its protection. From the information which has yet reached me, and upon which I can at all depend, I am inclined to think that the demonstration may suffice to enforce the restitution of or com pensation for cattle stolen, often with impunity, in incessant and latterly increasing depredations, by the Basutos, from the burghers, who are restrained by law from retaliation, as well as from the chief Moroko, avowedly as a punishment for his ser vices rendered on the side of the British Government in Major Warden's campaign. The long-delayed adjustment of the several other matters with the Griqua chief and others, for which the British Govern ment is responsible, will give no trouble. Should the chief Moshesh, however, prefer the issue of battle to restitution, when the equitable demand shall have been estimated by my Assistant Commissioners, and made to him by me, it may be necessary to proceed to take it. In that case I should, in all probability, ascend the right bank of the Cale don, about three days' march, and recross it at a drift on the road leading to Letsea's Kraal, near the French mission station of Monja. This Letsea is the eldest son of Moshesh, and his people, instigated by him, have been the principal thieves. From the kraal of this chief to Thaba Bossiou the access is easy ; and that place, which is situated on a table mountain, believed by the Basutos to be difficult of access, contains all the personal property of the chief, and great store of gunpow der, &c. Even should the requisite reprisal of cattle be ren-"], [197, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 167 dered difficult by the driving of it into the mountain, sufficient indignity will be inflicted by the destruction of this citadel. Whilst, should resistance be offered, all the enemies of Moshesh shall be let loose upon him, and the mountain will no longer shelter his cattle. The necessity for a decided assertion of authority in this case does not merely rest on the interests of the inhabitants of the Orange River territory ; but Morosi, a Basuto chief tributary to and under the control of Moshesh, is the immediate neigh bour on the border of this district, and has been most active in his aggressions against the colonists of the district of Albert, and it is questionable whether the balance of advantage from depredations and reprisals does not now rest on his side. The result of my settlement with Moshesh will materially influence the terms on which I can re-establish peace on this particular part of the border, and which I therefore necessarily defer till that is decided. I am happy to say the small force I have here assembled, both in respect to commanders and men, is as perfect in all respects as I could desire, as well as sufficient for all purposes that can be required of them, and therefore it will be my fault if that which may, after duly consulting my Assistant Commis sioners, conscientiously appear to me to be essential to the estabbshment of a permanent peace, and the vindication of Her Majesty's authority, be not accomplished in a satisfactory manner.

Cath- cart to the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies, &c. Graham's Town, January 13, 1853. Sir, \u2014 In my last despatch dated 4th ultimo, on the Caledon River, I mentioned my intention of ascending the right bank of that river to Platberg, with the force under my command, for the purpose of bringing matters to a speedy issue, and avoiding the chance of a protracted and expensive warfare, babie to end either in an unsatisfactory compromise, or the necessity for the same movement at last, after incurring all the expense of unnecessary delay. The information that the Chief Moshesh was collecting all his forces in the neighbour hood of Thaba Bossiou also convinced me that he would not submit fully to such terms as I might think it my duty to im pose, except upon compulsion. The march up the right bonk of the Caledon, of 101 miles in six days, through an uninhabited country, chiefly consisting of vast plains interspersed with table mountains, and abrupt rocky eminences peculiar to South Africa, afforded nothing worthy of remark, except the admirable order and discipline preserved by the troops, the cheerful manner in which they performed their marches, and the regularity and efficiency of the commissariat department. The army arrived at Platberg on the morning of the 13th, the day appointed in my proclamation for the meeting of chiefs. I found Platberg to consist of the rums of a Hottentot vil lage, formerly the habitation of a small band of adventurers called Bastards, under a leader of the name of Carolus Batjee, the only remaining habitable dwellings being the house of a Wesleyan missionary, and two cottages occupied by European traders; for since Carolus Batjee and his followers, who held their land by a grant from Moshesh, had taken part with Major"], [202, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 170 Warden on behalf of British authority against Moshesh, they had been expelled from Platberg, and are without any location; but the house and property of the missionary had been re spected, and even the gardens of the Bastards had not been destroyed by the Basutos. The enclosed consecutive statement of events and series of documents will put you in possession of subsequent occur rences, ending in the entire submission of the enlightened and powerful Chief Moshesh, and his first recognition of vassalage to Her Majesty's authority, for in all former intercommunica tions his acknowledgment only extended to albance and friendly relations. The severe loss inflicted on his people in killed and wounded, the precise amount of which can never be ascertained, but which concurrent native rumours place at from 500 to 600, as well as in cattle, and the conviction that the preservation of his villages and rich corn lands, and even his own residence, from destruction, only rested upon the forbearance and disci pline of Her Majesty's troops, and which his armed force has not power to resist, will, I hope, secure the permanency of the peace now re-estabbsbed, and the sincerity of his endeavours to prevent collision between his people and the border farmers, which, I trust, may put an end to a system of plunder and reprisal \u2014 a course which, so long as he remained under the denunciation of which be complained in bis letter of the 13th October, 1851, to Sir Harry Smith, of having been declared \"an enemy to the Queen,\" he felt justified in countenancing if not openly instigating. Thus, I trust, he may be found, should occasion require it, a valuable and willing ally of no small power, instead of continu ing to be a troublesome and fretful neighbour. I deeply regret that this object has not been accomplished without the loss of so many gallant soldiers, occasioned chiefly by an accidental cfrcumstance, to which operations in a most difficult and unknown mountain country, defended by a warbke"], [203, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 171 and well-armed race, acquainted with every pass, must always be liable, and are beyond the reach or control of the general in command, who can only be present and personally direct in one part of so intricate a field at a time ; but, considering the respectable nature of the Basuto force, consisting of from 5000 to 6000 cavalry, and, it is said, 2000 infantry, well armed, generally with fire-arms as well as assagaais, the cavalry almost all clothed in European costume, and with saddles \u2014 in short, evincing not only by then: equipments, but their movements, a degree of mibtary efficiency little inferior to irregular Cossacks or Cfrcassians \u2014 I am of opinion that, bad it not been for the loss unfortunately sustained by the 12th Lancers, the casualties would not have been more than proportionate to the unavoid able consequence of the conflict, in which from 5000 to 6000 head of cattle were wrested from the pastures of the Thaba Bossiou territory in defiance of all opposition. When day dawned on the morning of the 21st ult. on the plains of Thaba Bossiou there was no enemy to be seen; and as the cavalry had not joined me, and 1500 bead of cattle, captured and brought into the bivouac by Lieutenant- Colonel Eyre on the previous evening, were an incumbrance, I directed Colonel Eyre to march back to the camp with them, taking them round by the same route by which I had advanced, that being the only one practicable for guns, and which passes round the western and northern base of the Berea Mountain, a dis tance of about fourteen miles, intending to resume operations in a day or two, as soon as the captured cattle could be removed to the standing camp at Platberg for security, and my object would have been the chief's residence, the first day's work having, as it was originally intended by me, served as a re connoissance of the approach practicable for guns through an intricate and unknown country, as well as of the nature of the post itself, and the numbers and character of the enemy. No opposition was made to our march to the camp, and,"], [204, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 172 except some groups on the summit ridge of the Berea, appa rently watching our movement, no enemy appeared ; whilst a stray herd of cattle and some horses, seemingly abandoned in the plain, were seized, and added to the capture, within their view. A few hours after my arrival in the flying camp on the Caledon, the bearer of a flag of truce presented himself oppo site the camp with the letter from the Chief Moshesh, written at Thaba Bossiou, in council, at midnight after the battle, and in the handwriting of the chief's son Nehemiah, who was educated at Cape Town, and speaks and writes English per fectly. On my receiving this document \u2014 in my responsible position, where all rested on my decision, for, from the distance from home and other circumstances, a Governor in these colonies has seldom the advantage of any definitive instruction, and is generally, as I have been, left entirely to bis own discretion, \u2014 I recognised an important crisis, in which one false step might involve the nation in a Basuto war, and embarrass the Govern ment, by perhaps irretrievably compromising the free option which now exists as to their future policy, in respect to the retention or abandonment of the sovereign rights and obliga tions of this territory, and at the same time leaving a state of irritation and excitement which might aggravate and perpetu ate the evils I came to allay, and requiring an army of occu pation to counteract the consequences ; whereas the abject and complete submission of the enemy, the sincerity of which I have no cause to doubt, and the forced payment of the penalty which bad been accomplished and admitted, were all the solid advantages I could ever hope to gain. Under these circumstances, I thought it my duty to accept the chief's submission, without further prosecution of the war.

I find, not only that you have not paid the fine of cattle imposed on you by the Assistant Commissioners, Major Hogge and Mr. Owen, and which you promised to pay, for the robberies of cattle and horses committed by your people, and with your knowledge, up to the time of your agreement with them, but since then you and the people over whom you rule, including Molitsani and Morosi, and your own son, Letsie, and certain robbers called Leteli and Busbuli, with their people, have been steal ing cattle from your neighbours, and otherwise doing them"], [207, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 175 hoi*m ; even murders have been committed by them, and this village has been plundered and destroyed. In short, the Ba suto people under your rule have become a nation of thieves. This state of things must not be, and I have come to put an end to it, and to restore peace between you and your neigh bours, if I can ; and if not, to put you and your people out of the way of doing them wrong, and this I must do promptly. I will not, therefore, stop to talk, but tell you now, once for all, that having carefully inquired into the business, and judg ing as mercifully and justly as I can what is the amount of cattle- and damage you should be required to restore, I demand of you ten thousand bead of cattle and one thousand horses, to be delivered over to the British resident at this place within three days' time, in order to be restored to those from whom they have been stolen. If this be not done I must go and take either cattle or other things from you and your people, and from Mobtsani and his people; and if resistance be made it will then be war between us, and I must then take three times the amount of cattle, as weU as kill many of your people, and destroy their dwellings and kraals, which I should be very sorry to be obliged to do ; but if this cattle be paid within three days, and that I am assured peace is restored, I will take the army back again in peace. Now, chief, if you are an honest man, it is for you to pay the just fine, which is not more than the cattle stolen, and save yourself and your people from ruin, or else prepare for war, for on the fourth day I must bring you to an account. You must also pay back to Sinkonyella what you have stolen from him, and be at peace with him. Carolus Baatjie and his people must return to Platberg, and the boundaries fixed by Governor Sir Harry Smith must be respected. When all this is done, you must remain at [peace with all your neighbours, and the Basutos must cease to be a nation of thieves, for if I come again it will not be talk, but to make"], [208, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 176 an end of the Basuto nation, as has been done of the Gaikas and the Tambookie tribe of Mapassa. (Signed) Geo. Cathcart, Governor, and High Commissioner. The next day the chief himself came to talk. This ultima tum was repeated to him. He returned home the same after noon, professing and promising to endeavour to collect the cattle within the given time. His sincerity was, however, doubtful. The following is a minute of the conference which took place on the occasion : Governor. \u2014 I am glad to see you, and to make your ac quaintance. Moshesh. \u2014 I am glad to see the Governor, as since his arrival in this country I have been expecting a visit from him, which his letter to me in October last led me to expect. Governor. \u2014 I told you in that letter that I hoped to meet you in peace, and I still hope so, as I look to you as the great chief in this part. Moshesh. \u2014 I hope so too, for peace is like the rain which makes the grass grow, while war is like the wind which dries it up. You are right in looking to me, that is in accordance with the treaties. Governor. \u2014 I will not now talk much, but wish to know whether you received my message yesterday, in which I made the demand of cattle and horses. I have nothing to alter in that letter. Moshesh. \u2014 Do you mean the letter I received from Mr. Owen? Governor. \u2014 Yes. Moshesh. \u2014 I received the letter, but do not know where I shall get the cattle from. Am I to understand that the 10,000 head demanded are a fine imposed for the thefts committed by my people, in addition to the cattle stolen ?"], [209, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 177 Governor.\u2014 I demand but 1 0,000 head, though your people have stolen many more, and consider this a just award, which must be paid in three days. Moshesh. \u2014 Do the three days count from yesterday or to day ? Governor. \u2014 To-day is the first of the three. Moshesh. \u2014 The time is short, aud the cattle many. Will you not allow me six days to collect them ? Governor. \u2014 You had time given you when Major Hogge and Mr. Owen made the first demand, and then promised to comply with it, but did not. Moshesh. \u2014 But I was not quite idle. Do not the papers in the commissioners' hands show that I collected them ? Governor. \u2014 They do, but not half of the number demanded. Moshesh. \u2014 That is true ; hut I have not now control enough over my people to induce them to comply with the demand, however anxious I may be to do so. Governor. \u2014 If you are not able to collect them, I must go and do it; and if any resistance be made it will then be war, and I shall not be satisfied with 10,000 head, hut shall take all I can. Moshesh. \u2014 Do not talk of war, for, however anxious I may be to avoid it, you know that a dog when beaten will show his teeth. Governor. \u2014 It will therefore be better that you should give up the cattle than that I should go for them. Moshesh. \u2014 I wish for peace; but have the same difficulty with my people that you have in the colony. Your prisons are never empty, and I have thieves among my people. Governor. \u2014 I would then recommend you to catch the thieves, and bring them to me, and I will hang them. Moshesh. \u2014 I do not wish you to hang them, but to talk to them and give them advice. If you hang them they cannot talk. Governor. \u2014 If I hang them they cannot steal, and I am not N"], [210, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 178 going to talk any more. I have said that if you do not give up the cattle in three days I must come and take them. , Moshesh. \u2014 I beg of you not to talk of war. Governor. \u2014 I have no more to say. I must either leave this in peace in three days, or go to Thaba Bossiou. I there fore advise you to go and collect the cattle as quickly as pos sible. Moshesh. \u2014 Do not talk of coming to Thaba Bossiou. If you do, I shall lay the blame on the Boers, from whom the cattle were stolen, and whom I requested to come and point out to me their cattle, that I might restore them. I will go at once, and do my best, and perhaps God will help me. After leaving his Excellency's tent, but before returning home, Moshesh sent to request that the day on which the interview took place might not count in the three. This re quest his Excellency acceded to; and on the 18th instant, the appointed day, Moshesh's son, Nehemiah, came in with 3500 head of cattle, which were received, and disposed of as follows : \u2014 Memorandum relative to Cattle received from the Chief Moshesh. 500 head of the best cattle will be selected to be sold to the contractor at \u00a3& per head, or otherwise to be driven with the column. The remainder to be driven to Bloem Fontein, and there distributed and disposed of as follows : \u2014 1000 head, a mixed but fair lot, to be given to Moroko in reward for his loyalty, and as some compensation for his losses. 250 to be given to Carolus Baatjie. 250 to be given to Gert Taibosch. The remainder, or Government portion, to be handed over to the commissariat officer, to be sold on account of Government. The condition is, that the three named chiefs cause the"], [211, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 179 whole to be driven to Bloem Fontein, and to be answerable for their safety on the road. Lieutenant Smyth, Cape Mounted Rifles, with twenty men of that corps, will proceed with the cattle, and see that they be not lost or exchanged on the road, and will rejoin at Smith field. (Signed) George Cathcart, Governor, and High Commissioner. Head-Quarters, Platberg, December 19, 1852. On the 19th instant, no more cattle appearing, his Excel lency directed Lieutenant- Colonel Eyre to move with the cavalry brigade, two horsed guns, and one brigade of infantry, and encamped on the Upper Caledon waggon drift leading to Molitsani's country. The following morning, 20th, this force, accompanied by his Excellency in person, marched at daylight in three columns. The results of its operations will be learnt from the following reports : \u2014 Camp, Caledon River, December 21, 1852. Sir, \u2014 Of the three columns that marched on the 20th in stant from the flying camp at the Caledon River, to chastise the Basuto Chief Moshesh, I have the honour to report the operations of that which was placed under your Excellency's more immediate personal observation. This force consisted of detachment 12th Lancers, under Lieutenant Gough ; a demi-battery, twelve pounder howitzers, under Captain Robinson, R A.; two companies 43rd Regiment, under Major Phillips; detachment Cape Mounted Riflemen, under Ensign Rorke. Its object, by moving along the western and southern base of the Berea Mountain, the summit of which Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre's column was to sweep, whilst Lieutenant-Colonel Napier with the cavalry would act round its northern and eastern faces, to prevent the escape of cattle n 2"], [212, "180 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S from the mountain, and to form a junction with the two columns on the Thaba Bassiou plains. The determination of the Basutos to defend their vast droves of cattle on the Berea Mountain was early indicated by their firing upon Captain Tylden and myself, when approaching the craggy cliffs in which they had posted themselves. On rounding the southern angle of the Berea, armed bodies of mounted Basutos were observed, formed in patches, closely observing our movements ; and approaching one of them, your Excellency, advancing in person to give them an opportunity of a parley, was answered by a shot, upon which the cavalry was ordered to extend and advance, and the enemy retired amongst the rocky ground under the mountain. A couple of rounds of shrapnel having, with admirable effect, been fired into them, they fled and dispersed towards Thaba Bossiou. . The infantry, which had been strengthened by a company of the 43rd Regiment from Lieutenant- Colonel Eyre's force, under Captain the Honourable Percy Herbert, were now brought up, and the column advanced, crossed the deep mountain stream \" Rietspruit,\" and were posted on a commanding knoll at the junction of this stream and the Little Caledon River, on the Thaba Bossiou plains, covering the approaches by which Lieu tenant-Colonel Eyre's and Lieutenant-Colonel Napier's columns were to join. Whilst in this position the enemy were collecting in fresh patches of horsemen in all directions; those approaching within distance w-ere driven back. On the clearing away of a thunder-storm and rain the enemy suddenly displayed his whole force. Masses of horsemen were observed to move from the Thaba Bossiou Poort to turn our right, whilst large bodies of them extended along our front. These movements were conducted with the utmost order and regularity. Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre's division joined at this time, 5 p.m., in possession of about 1500 bead of cattle, which it was necessary to secure, for which purpose some kraals in a com-"], [213, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 181 manding position were ordered to be occupied. The enemy, who had now mustered not less than 6000 horsemen, made every effort to assail the troops moving into their bivouac, re peating their attacks upon both our front and rear, but were repulsed in every attempt by the gallantry and steadiness of the troops. Nothing could exceed the soldierlike bearing of the three companies of the 43rd Regiment, the cavalry detach ment, and the valuable service rendered by the demi-battery under Captain Robinson, who by a round of canister silenced the enemy's fire, which had kept up until 8 p.m., when the enemy retired and disappeared from the field, having suffered severely. Where the gallant conduct of every officer and soldier during this long and trying day has fallen so immediately under your ExceUency's personal observation, it is beyond my province to bring them especially to your notice, although I may be per mitted to name Major Phillips, commanding the three compa nies 43rd Regiment, Captain Faddy, commanding Royal Artil lery, Lieutenant Gough, 12th Lancers, commanding detach ments of cavalry, and to particularise the officers attached to my own department, Captain Wellesley, D. A. A. General, who was wounded, and had his horse shot under him ; Captain Lord Alexander Russell, D. A. Q. M. General, Captain Tylden, and Lieutenant Stanton, R.E., who assisted me in my duties; all these officers having displayed quabties in the field as conspi cuous as those they possess in the general knowledge of their profession.

Sir, \u2014 As regards the affairs of this immediate part of the colonial frontier, and of British Kaffraria, I am able to report in the most satisfactory manner. There has not been an attempt to re-occupy the Waterkloof since its final clearance in September last ; and, indeed, its pre sent mibtary occupation by three field works, garrisoned only by small detachments of the 91st Regiment, render it impossible for an enemy, or even a marauding party, to harbour there. The Gaika District is now entirely evacuated by Kafirs, With the exception of the obstinate and cunning old Chief Macomo, who, with forty followers, lurks about its intricate recesses and forests, and has hitherto evaded pursuit ; but unless he sur renders, which he appears disposed to do, he must ere long fall into our hands ; in the meantime, he is perfectly harmless. Sandilli is in the country of Kreili, across the Kei, and the greater part of his tribe have dispersed, and appear to have settled in that country ; so have the majority of the outstanding rebel Hottentots, and their leader Uithaalder ; but a desperate member of that band, named Brander, who went also beyond the Kei, but found the absence of game or excitement in that country irksome and unsuited to his taste, he, with forty fol- * See General Order, Letter E in Appendix to Minute addressed to the Legislative Council."], [215, "183 CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. lowers, came back, and attempted to establish himself, with marauding views, in the Zuurberg, which is in the heart of the colony. He has, however, been most gallantly hunted up by the Albany pobce, who, assisted by a detachment of the 12th Regiment, brought his band to a desperate engagement, in which, although the police suffered the loss of one officer killed and one wounded, and three men killed, sixteen dead bodies of the Hottentot band remained on the field, and no doubt as many more were wounded, so that this attempt to disturb the peace of the colony is not likely to be repeated, and could not succeed. I will not fail to turn my attention immediately to the means of reducing all war expenses as far as possible, and hope by next post to be able to report satisfactory progress. In the meantime the earnest desire for pardon and peace evinced by the Chief Kreib, who is now the only remaining neighbouring native chief with whom we are still at war, and his good conduct in the restoration of some stolen horses on a recent occasion, as well as his efforts to collect the remaining portion of a fine imposed by my predecessor, amounting now to less than 1000 head, have induced me to instruct the Chief Commissioner to offer him pardon and peace on the terms specified in the enclosed letter to Colonel Maclean.* These I have no doubt he will willingly subscribe to ; and I think they will complete the final accomplishment of the task imposed on me when I assumed this command, that of the reduction of the rebellious Kafirs and Hottentots to complete submission, and the restoration of permanent peace and security to the colonial frontier. I enclose a copy of the last report received from Colonel Maclean. I have, &c, (Signed) George Cathcart, Governor, and High Commissioner. The Right Hon. Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, &c. &c. * See Proclamation in Letter U of Appendix to Minute."], [216, "184 THE HON. STR GEORGE CATHCART'S Copy of a Despatch from Lieut.-General the Hon. G. Cathcart to the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies. King William's Town, February 11, 1853. Sir, \u2014 I have already, on assuming the government of British Kaffraria, acquainted you that the government of this district was carried on under martial law ; and I forwarded a printed copy of the one only proclamation which contained all the regulations required for this government in its infant state, with certain alterations I then made to it. The provisions contained in that simple code have proved sufficient for all purposes, and I received your sanction and ap proval of it as a provisional measure, until some more regular form of government should be established. I had not been informed, nor had any documents been de livered over to me which could make me aware at that time, or indeed till within a few weeks past, that there was then laying in the Colonial Secretary's office at Cape Town, Letters Patent under the Great Seal, with accompanying Royal Instructions, constituting British Kaffraria a regular government, bearing date 16th December, 1850. Having caused these to be for warded to me, I received them here a few days since ; but there is no copy of correspondence extant to show whether they were in force or laid aside, and as a short time since the Great Seal of the territory was sent out to me with orders to use it, I think it possible the state of the case may not be known to you. I have carefully read and considered these Letters Patent and Instructions. There is nothing in the existing practice which is not perfectly in accordance with the Instructions, and I cannot see why they should have remained in abeyance, because they are admirably adapted for the government of this country, and are in no way incompatible with the exercise of martial law. When I first assumed the government as Commauder-in-"], [217, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 185 Chief and High Commissioner, Colonel Mackinnon, then Chief Commissioner of British Kaffraria, being a colonel on the staff, could exercise martial law, and, therefore, in the absence of the High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief, his power and authority was paramount, even in matters of a civil nature ; but he having been succeeded in the functions of Chief Commissioner by Colonel Maclean, formerly the T'Slam bie Commissioner, and on whose admirable management and influence over the Chief Pato, and other faithful chiefs, so much depended the possibility of maintaining this possession in the early part of the rebellion, has, with your sanction and approval, succeeded to the appointment, which he fills in the most satis factory manner ; but having previously retired from the army, cannot, properly speaking, be invested even with deputed authority under martial law. This defect has been provisionally remedied by the presence of a Major-General in command, who is always ready to sup port his authority. I understand martial law, in its relation to constitutional law, to be merely a paramount power given to the Commander-in-Chief to go beyond the law, where, in cases of emergency, the regular law may be insufficient or unable to act, but not to interfere with it where it can act and is sufficient. I find that if the Letters Patent were now to be carried into effect, and the Chief Commissioner to receive a wan-ant as Lieutenant-Governor, it would precisely place him in a position which I think he ought to bold, without in the slightest degree altering the deputed powers or the mode of government which he now exercises, but that they would then become legal and constitutional ; and all that would be necessary to give imme diate effect to this regular form of government would be to change the existing code of regulations into the form of an ordinance, and any subsequent additions, alterations, or amend ments would be made in the form of separate ordinances, under the seal of the Government, as well as the primary one, as en-"], [218, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 186 joined in the Royal Instructions, duly forwarded for confirma tion to Her Majesty's Secretary of State. No increase of salary or expenditure of any kind would be required. I should not have hesitated to have acted upon the Letters Patent and Instructions the moment I had seen them ; but from the circumstance of their having remained so long in abeyance, to which I have no clue, I think it now right to wait for your orders. I have already reported to you the existence of a similar state of things in respect to the Orange River territory ; hut in that case everything must remain in suspense until Her Majesty's Government shall have come to a final decision whether the Sovereignty is to be retained or abandoned.

That he shall recognise and respect the line of the Indwe and the Kei as the boundary. That he shall do his utmost to restrain and punish all at tempts on the part of his people to disturb the peace of Her Majesty's subjects, whether Tambookies or others, on this side the line. That if missionaries or traders be again suffered to live in his country, it must be with his consent, and they must conform to such agreement as they may make for themselves with the said chief; the Governor, on behalf of the British Government, will have nothing to do with any such agreement; but the Governor will hold the Chief Kreili answerable for the security of the bves and property of those British subjects whom he may allow to bve within his territory.

Graham's Town, May 20, 1853. gIRj \u2014 When I assumed the responsibility of the government and chief command in the colony, in the year 1852, the critical"], [220, "THE FION. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 188 state of the frontier affairs called for the most active and unre mitting exertions, not only of Her Majesty's regular troops, whose zeal, endurance, and gallantry is beyond all praise, but of a numerous body of colonial levies and assembled burghers, acting under their respective commandants and field-cornets, all of whose patriotic services in defence of their country must ever claim for them the admiration and gratitude of their fellow countrymen. During the progress of active operations there are many causes which render it impossible to communicate to the public either the policy of the General or a regular journal of occur rences. General orders, Government notices, and proclama tions have been duly published from time to time, but the very natural pubbc demand for something more than what is pub lished by authority is apt to induce a supply of very apocryphal intelligence and reasonings ; and speculations founded on a false basis cannot fail to lead to error. Under the impression that this has been peculiarly the case during the period that the responsibility of conducting opera tions for the suppression of rebellion and termination of the war on the eastern frontier has been imposed on me, I think it no less due to the Colony than to myself to take the earliest opportunity which an abatement of a hitherto almost over whelming pressure of business will allow me, of preparing and laying before the Legislative Council a Minute explanatory of the pobcy I have pursued, and its result at the present time, when peace has been restored, and, as I believe, with every prospect of permanency, which circumstances as I found them, and the nature of things over which there can be no human control, will permit. It would have been very gratifying to me to have met the Legislative Council personally on this occasion, when I have to congratulate the Colony on the announcement of Her Majesty's gracious Orders in Council, by which the most liberal consti tution for self-government hitherto granted to any of the pos-"], [221, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 189 sessions of the British Crown, is about to become the law of this land. And it would have been no less gratifying to me, by a plain statement of facts, verbally to have placed the present state of frontier affairs before them in its true light ; being myself con vinced that it is only necessary, in order to dispel a mist occa sioned by erroneous intelligence, and unsound speculations founded thereon, to satisfy the unprejudiced public that scarcely at any former period of colonial history did there ever exist a more promising aspect of their frontier affairs, and that all that could be done has been done. Having, however, the advantage of your Honour's able and cordial co-operation at Cape Town, which has supported me so essentially during the performance of my laborious and respon sible task on this frontier; and considering that being here, although my more active duties have ceased, I have still some arrangements to complete, which I think will tend to the better ordering of frontier affairs, I now request you to take an early opportunity of laying the accompanying Minute, in the shape of a printed Blue Book, before the Legislative Council, with the assurance of my highest respect for that Honourable Board. I have, &c, &c, Geo. Cathcart, Governor. His Honour the Lieut.-Governor, &c. &c, MINUTE. Graham's Town, May 20, 1853. The Hon'ble the Members of the Legislative Council. Honourable Gentlemen, \u2014 It will be in your recollection that as soon as certain measures were taken by Governor Cath cart, immediately on his arrival in the colony in the month of April, 1852, in respect to the passing of the ordinance for the establishment of a Representative Assembly, and the transmis-"], [222, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 190 sion of that instrument to Her Majesty's Government for final confirmation, the General proceeded without delay to relieve his predecessor in British Kaffraria, and assume the command of the army, at that time still engaged in a frontier war of rebellion ; and that, having arrived at King Wilbam's Town on the 9th April, the responsibibty in respect to the conduct of the late war then first devolved upon him from that date. The state of things as he found them at that time was as follows : \u2014 1. \u2014 The Gaika Chief Sandilli and bis associate chieftains, with their numerous followers, though somewhat disheartened by fifteen months' active and successful operations, and less well provided with ammunition than they had been at the beginning of the war, were still in occupation of their several locations, and though repeated patrols had traversed their intricate country, and the rebels had been chased about from one haunt to another, they had never been permanently driven out of their forest strongholds, and there was no evidence to show that the Gaika tribe, originally amounting to 27,000 souls, and probably counting 5000 effective warriors, had been yet dispersed or materially reduced in numbers. Their crops of Indian com had, to a great extent, been destroyed ; and of their cattle, some had been captured, some bad been driven across the Kei into Kreili's country, or into other locations, by the Kafirs themselves, for security ; and but bttle remained to supply their immediate wauts in respect to food. This was the position of the hostile Kafirs who occupied the Amatolas and northern portion of British Kaffraria ; whilst of the T'Slambie chiefs, whose tribes occupy the southern portion and sea-board of British Kaffraria, Pato and Siwani had proved faithful to their allegiance, and the Chief Umhala, although suspected of insincerity as to his professions of loyalty, had never openly taken part in the rebellion. Had this been otherwise, it is manifest that British Kaffraria would have been untenable, King Wilbam's Town must have"], [223, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 191 been abandoned as the base of operations, and the lost territory would only have been recoverable by re- conquest from some other base. 2. \u2014 Some thirty miles within the colony, in the district of Fort Beaufort, stands the Kroome Mountain Range, in which the too notorious Waterkloof is only one of five or six deep and densely wooded concentric ravines, each several miles in length, radiating to various points of the compass. This mountain fastness, although it had been several times patrolled through, with more or less effect and loss on each occasion, and had been the scene of most arduous and gallant enterprise and bard service on the part of Her Majesty's troops and levies, was, nevertheless, at the period at which this Minute com mences, again in full and entire possession of the enemy. In deed it is asserted by the Chief Macomo, that he and his two or three thousand followers had never been driven out of the district ; but had dodged from one kloof to another, and re occupied their former position as soon as the troops had been withdrawn. At that time this obstinate and crafty chief had associated with him the rebellious Tambookie chieftain Quesha, with nu merous followers, as well as a very considerable body of Hot tentots ; most of whom had formed a portion of the band of the rebel Hermanus, and had sought shelter in the Kroome mountains since the death of that chief and dispersion of his followers, and had been joined by deserters and others. The more enterprising of these, issuing forth in marauding parties, well mounted and armed, had long been the scourge of the colony, extending their depredations far into the districts of Cradock and Somerset, and appeared to be carrying on their nefarious doings with increasing audacity there, though not without severe encounters and loss of life on both sides; and, in spite of the vigilance and noble resistance of the farmers of those districts, too often succeeded in carrying off their booty,"], [224, "192 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S lodging it in security, beyond the possibility of rescue, in their impenetrable receptacle for stolen property. 3. \u2014 The petty Kafir chiefs, Seyolo, Stock, and Tola, each at the head of daring and adventurous followers, among whom were also rebel Hottentots, bad established themselves also within the colonial border, and were lurking in the Keiskamma kloofs and Fish River bush, frequently extending their maraud ing excursions far within the district of Albany, carrying off their booty into their almost undiscoverable retreats ; and from the commencement of the war, these freebooters had not only cut off all communication in the direct line between King Wil liam's Town and _ Graham's Town by Line Drift, but rendered travelling in the district of Albany and Fort Beaufort, except under strong military escort, impracticable; and even carried devastation and terror to the suburbs of Graham's Town; whilst, with the exception of Fort Peddie and Alice, two con centrated Fingo locations, the whole district of south Victoria was in their full possession. 4. \u2014 The district known as the Kat River Settlement, or Stockenstrom, which might be considered as the soil in jwhich the seeds of the rebellion had principally been sown, or spon taneously germinated, was now deserted, and its population dispersed, one half at least having joined in active rebellion : \u2014 but of the other it would be unjust not to notice that a large portion had been enrolled, and was doing good and gallant service on the side of Government; and the remainder had rallied for protection, and to avoid suspicion, round the mili tary station at Eland's Post. 5. \u2014 North of the Katberg Range, in the Tambookie country, the faithful regent Nonese, widow of the deceased great chief Umtirara, had migrated beyond the Bashee, with as many of her followers as she could influence, in order to withdraw them from contamination. Those Tambookie tribes that had be come involved in the rebellion were still engaged in acts of"], [225, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 193 spoliation, and destruction of the property of the farmers in the districts of North Victoria, Albert, and Cradock ; and these, associated with the rebel Hottentots of that northern district, still continued to be a very formidable symptom in the general disordered state of things. Without entering into the origin of this portion of the war (as regards the Tambookie participation in it) in this place, there is no doubt that it had become a part of the general war of races ; and had it not been checked by the gallant and able exertions of Captain Tylden, of the Royal Engineers, who was sent to Whittlesea at the outbreak, to take the command of such local force as he could there collect; and who bad organ ised and made good use of the burghers and other native levies of that district, it might have proved at least as formidable as that on the Kaffrarian frontier. This war, though much subdued, was not extinguished ; and a system of captures and reprisals still prevailed, leaving the frontier in a state of insecurity and alarm, and obliging the abandonment of all border farms. 6. \u2014 The paramount Chief Kreili, who resides beyond the Kei, but whose hereditary and feudal influence was acknowledged as extending over the whole of the Kafir tribes, had recently taken part in a formidable combined hostile movement against the district of North Victoria, which was repulsed and defeated, with the infliction of great loss, by Captain Tylden, \u2014 and was still decidedly aiding and abetting in the cause of the war of races. He contumaciously refused to comply with an injunc tion imposed by the former Governor, when he withdrew his troops from an expedition beyond the Kei, after capturing some 30,000 head of cattle, \u2014 which injunction was a payment of a further fine of 1500 head of cattle, in compensation for da ma\u00b0*e done to certain missionaries and traders' property within his territory, and in token of submission. A letter of demand of payment, as a pledge of sincerity in his promises to the former Governor, was returned, with no promise of compliance. o"], [226, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 194 The participation of his people in the war could be proved, but it was not then known that he had been personally en gaged. 7. \u2014 In the Sovereignty, 400 miles removed from the base of operations, \u2014 with which district, from the nature of the inter vening country and the interrupted course of postal arrange ments, communication often occupied a fortnight or three weeks' interval, \u2014 a mistaken policy had provoked a system of petty warfare between the burgher population and the powerful Basuto people along their whole extensive frontier. Although in this warfare both parties had hitherto abstained from de struction of property, captures of cattle and reprisals, often with loss of life on both sides, were of frequent recurrence. In this quarrel, the agent of Government appears to have adopted the cause of the burghers, without taking the course of investigation aud mediation, with a view to amicable adjust ment of certain boundary questions, where justice not only would have warranted but demanded that observance ; and, having no military force to support his authority, had called in to his aid certain petty chieftains and their bauds, whom he still openly instigated to vex and annoy the Basutos, whose powerful, and by no means ill-disposed chief, he had denounced as an enemy to the Queen. Although there did not appear to be any immediate danger to the colony from that quarter, reports led to the belief that if this state of things were long suffered to continue, and the authority of the British Resident held in contempt, a war, more difficult to manage and more expensive thau the Kaffrarian war, must sooner or later be the result ; and one in which it is very questionable whether justice and good faith would be found to be on the side supported by the British Government. The influence of this paramount chief on his dependant Morosi, who resides on the colonial frontier of Albert, and was asso ciated in mischief with the rebel Tambookies, also kept that district in a constant state of warfare and alarm."], [227, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 195 Added to these difficulties, which, contrary to the too san guine expectations entertained in many quarters as to the pos sibility of speedily terminating the war, remained to be disposed of, a new feature in the border warfare had recently sprung up. This was an organised system among all the rebel Hottentots in arms, who, though separated in various \" laagers\" or camps, under their respective commanders, bad acknowledged the su preme authority of an able and influential Hottentot leader of the name of Willem Uithaalder, who exercised the most arbi trary control over them. The force obedient to his command, when all concentrated at his bidding, might amount to 400 well armed and mounted men, many of whom were trained and disciplined deserters. The advantage of secret information, derived from unsus pected confederates in the colony, and the facilities of sudden concentration, and, when the deed was done, of equally sudden dispersion among the hostile Kafirs, rendered these enemies difficult to deal with \u2014 so that on one occasion, at the Koonap, they proved but too successful ; and once only, by the judicious arrangements of Major-General Yorke and the indefatigable exertions of Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre and the gallant troops under his command, was it found possible to hunt them up or surprise them, with any real effect, by the movement of regular troops. The true state of things, as they existed on the northern and eastern frontier of the colony, when the responsibility devolved upon the new Commander-in-Chief in the month of April, 1852, having been faithfully set forth, it is necessary in the next place to advert to the measures which were adopted to meet them ; and as the leading facts are already in posses sion of the public, it is needless to eDter into any military details. The policy adopted by the new Commander-in-Chief, and o 2"], [228, "196 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S from which he has never swerved, may be explained in a few words : \u2014 \u25a0 1st. To remove the principal base of operations from King William's Town to a point within the colony, and commence systematically working outwards from that base. 2ndly. To make good every advantage gained, so that the enemy when once expelled should not be suffered to return. Srdly. To establish a mounted police force within the colonial boundary, for the security of the frontier districts against ma rauders. 4thly. To clear the Waterkloof and other strongholds held by Kafirs, and abolish all Kafir locations within the colony. 5thly. To clear the Amatolas; and, after the total and final expulsion of the rebellious Gaikas, to secure military occupa tion of that vantage ground by a sufficient force and a system of field works, or intrenched camps, easily defended by a few hands, thereby multiplying the efficient strength of the dis posable force. 6thly. Finally, when these things should be accomplished, and that the rebels should be sufficiently punished and sub dued, and compelled to submit and sue for pardon, then to exercise the royal prerogative of mercy, entrusted to the discre tion of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, in granting pardon and peace to the subjects recently in rebellion \u2014 not treating with them, but dictating such terms as should appear practicable, just, and expedient, and such as it might, in the nature of things, be possible to enforce with the means at his disposal, so as to secure the prospect of as lasting a peace as existing circumstances, which human power cannot change, would permit. It is unnecessary in this paper, which is not intended to serve as a chronicle of events, to carry on a narrative of military ope rations, or to recount the noble and indefatigable exertions made by Her Majesty's troops and paid levies during a two years'"], [229, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 197 uninterrupted warfare. Trusting to the documents already published for those details, it is only necessary briefly to re mind you, seriatim, of the manner in which the ends proposed have been carried out and accompbshed : \u2014 1st. By the establishment of the post on the Temacha, and the restoration and occupation of that at Line Drift, the direct communication between Graham's Town and King William's Town, which had remained closed since the commencement of the war, was re-opened. The Temacha post, also, at once served as a separation be tween the loyal and disloyal, and rendering the country of Seyolo no louger tenable, shortly induced the surrender of that chief. 2ndly. Although all the advantages to be derived from the port of East London and the garrison of King William's Towu were duly appreciated and kept in operation, the head quarters were removed to Fort Beaufort, as the point within the colony from whence military operations might be directed in a syste matical manner, with a view not only to the suppression o* rebellion within the boundary, but the removal of hostibties far beyond it, according to the system above enunciated. 3rdly. In addition to the existing organisation of paid levies and numerous burgher stations, which appeared to be insuffi cient for the purpose, the measure of the establishment of au efficient mounted police for the better protection of the border districts was carried out with as bttle delay as possible. The importance of this measure, proved by its successful operation, is sufficiently manifest to require no argument in support of it. 4tbly. The next step was to provide, with all possible atten tion to the other numerous points then in difficulty, for the better restraint of the lawless forays which emanated from the Waterkloof, as far as the means then available would admit ; but a due regard to other exigencies did not render those means sufficient for a final clearance at that moment."], [230, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 198 Some active operations, however, ending in the establish ment of a permanent mibtary post, garrisoned by a battalion iu the centre of the Kroome Range, and the restoration and re occupation of the post at the Koonap, and other precautions, rendered it possible to leave the frontier of the colony in suffi cient security whilst another urgent service called for the ab sence of the Commander-in-Chief, and a considerable portion of his available force. This occasion was the necessity for an expedition beyond the Kei, called for by circumstances which have already been ex plained. A proclamation was issued, calling forth the colonial energies in support of their own cause, founded on reasons therein stated, and although many excuses were received, on account of the disturbed state of things and the necessity for domestic protection, many noble- spirited and loyal burghers, led by Commandants Kruger and Van Aardt, met the Commander-in- Chief at Bram Neck, on the appointed day. From the districts of Albany, Port Ebzabeth, Victoria, and Fort Beaufort, a very efficient aud pubbc-spirited body of vo lunteers, armed, mounted, and equipped by voluntary subscrip tions raised by the more wealthy part of the community, to whom it was not convenient to render personal service, and a well-appointed band of mounted volunteers from King Wil liam's Town, who took the field at their own expense, also joined the force, and worthily completed the colonial con tingent. These, supported by the detachments of Her Majesty's troops under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Michel and Lieutenant-Colonel Napier, sufficed in one foray to levy the fine of 15,000 head of cattle, which the Commander-in-Chief considered sufficient penalty, for as much as the fine itself only amounted to 1700 bead, and that same chief had within two years been mulcted of not less than 60,000 head of cattle, the"], [231, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 199 value of which to the owners deprived of them, and including numbers dispersed and killed by over-driving, cannot be com puted at less than \u00a3100,000. The acquisition of cattle was no object, and all that was taken was divided, at Balotta, among the burghers and other colonists who had assisted in its capture ; but in point of policy, it was the desire of the Governor to show the promptness and facility with which a similar penalty could be enforced, should it be justly incurred at any future time ; and that the colonial ener gies, unaided by Her Majesty's troops, if heartily put forth, would be sufficient to do it. This having been accomplished in a nine days' foray, the Governor lost no time in traversing the deserted country of the Windvogelberg and Kabousie, in a straight line to King Wil liam's Town, where bis sudden and unexpected appearance, with the knowledge that the force which had gone beyond the Kei would return to their former stations in a few days, could not and did not fail to produce a salutary impression. . He then assembled all the friendly chiefs at Fort Murray, the residence of the T'Slambie Commissioner, Captain Mac lean, whose judicious management, founded on strict equity and carried out with firmness, bad secured their confidence and esteem; and giving them due credit for their loyalty, and pointing out to them the advantages of their prosperous cir cumstances, as contrasted with those of their misguided and rebellious brethren, be bad reason to feel convinced that even if their fidelity had ever wavered, it was then confirmed and secure. Of this he has since experienced ample proof. As soon as the troops bad returned from the Kei, and that, leaving all things safe, he could withdraw a sufficient available force, the next object became the final clearance of the Water kloof. This was accomplished by the unparalleled exertions of some 2000 of Her Majesty's troops and some Fingoes and loyal Hottentots, in three days' and nights' unceasing vigilance and exertion ; for they slept at nights in the place where they"], [232, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 200 left off, resuming operations at daybreak, until every krantz and kloof had been cleared by the troops under the command of Colonel Buller and Lieutenant- Colonel Eyre : and two addi tional field works having been established, one in the centre and the other at the entrance of the Waterkloof, no Kafirs or Hottentots have appeared there since, nor is it possible that they should ever harbour there again, if the ordinary precau tions now established be not prematurely abandoned. There remained yet to be accomplished the final clearance of the Amatolas, in which Sandilli had now been joined by the fugitive Macomo, and in which the rebel Hottentot Uithaalder, with some 300 of his band, though frequeutly driven, with loss, from one laager to another, was still harboured. Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre having been placed in command of a sufficient force, the final clearance was accomplished by inces sant patrols, in less than a fortnight. The Hottentots and main bodies of Kafirs were soon dislodged and driven to the Kei, but the Chiefs Sandilli and Macomo for some time longer bngered there in bidden recesses, with a few followers, hoping to obtain terms not amounting to total forfeiture and expul sion ; and, though constantly incurring hair-breadth escapes, evaded capture, and ultimately, in despair, fled to the kloofs and woods on the margin of the Kei, which afford an asylum, though of more limited extent, nearly as favourable to them as those on the banks of the Keiskamma, though more easily approached through vast tracts of open country. All the rebellious Kafirs having now been expelled from the extensive mountain district which formerly constituted the Gaika territory, small field works, with sufficient garrisons, were established at such points as not only command all pas sages through them, but, so long as they are occupied as they are at present, prevent the possibibty either of the re-establish ment of a Kafir dwelling-place, the cultivation of a garden, or the pasturage of the smallest herd of cattle. These field works consist, in fact, of little more than kraals and enclosures from"], [233, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 201 60 to 100 yards square, having secure bastions at two opposite angles. The object of this arrangement was to render all the stores, cattle, and other necessary incumbrances of a camp, secure against any attempt of a Kafir enemy, with a very small guard left at home for its protection; thereby rendering the force available for active duty more than doubly efficient : con stant patrolling from these posts has been the principal agency by which the total clearance of the whole of the former Gaika districts has been accomplished, and so long as the system be adhered to, their return without leave is rendered impossible. Although at this period of the war the arrival of voluntary instalments of cattle from the Chief Kreili, notwithstanding the penalties that bad been inflicted upon him, in part payment of the original fine, evinced his submission and desire for a return to favour with the British Government, and that the cessation for some time of all resistance on the part of the Gaikas indi cated a similar disposition, the Governor did not yet think the time bad come for the exercise of the royal clemency towards these native tribes, whether considering the Gaikas as subjects in rebelbon, or the Amagaiekas, Kreili's people, as an inde pendent neighbouring state. Leaving, therefore, ample force for their control, bis atten tion was turned to the disturbed state of things then prevaibng in the Orange River territory and the frontier of the district of Albert, previously to the final settlement of affairs, which bad now been drawn to a crisis and nearly to a close. He decided, therefore, on withdrawing, with this view, a force of 2000 men on his own responsibility, trusting to the approval of Her Majesty's Government, which he has since fully received, to march with it to the north, and after finally settling the Tam bookie question, and dictating terms of pardon, on his way past Whittlesea, to that subdued and now penitent people, to endeavour not only to put an end to the vexatious war of reprisals and other disorders in the Sovereignty, but restore peace, confidence, and security along the whole colonial frontier"], [234, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 202 of Albert and Victoria, which he deemed a matter of necessity before it would be possible to take iuto consideration the reduc tion of the vast military expenditure called for by the extensive, complicated, and obdurate warfare which had prevailed at the period of his assumption of the command. The accomplishment aud successful results of all these ope rations will be further explained and better understood by the following exposition of the existing state of things. To commence with the Orange River territory or Sove reignty :\u2014 The result of the late expedition to that country, by the Commander-in-Chief, has been, as he anticipated, and stated as his object, \u2014 1st. His primary object was the restoration of peace, by the administration and enforcement of equal unprejudiced justice to all classes of Her Majesty's subjects, without distinction as to origin or colour, that being the only basis on which peace between antagonistic races, when unsustained by au army, which in this instance was out of the question, can ever prove lasting. 2ndly. He had in view the cancelbng of all troublesome though questionable claims, engendered by a mistaken policy of recruiting petty native chieftains on the side of Government ; not only advocating their own quarrels, but sometimes in sup port of unjustifiable aggression placing them in array against the powerful Chief Moshesh. A war of retaliation was thus engendered, and as the weaker party suffered, compensation was claimed on account of loyal services. These claims have all been finally settled or cancelled, according to their merits ; and the policy of setting one tribe against another has been changed to that of non-intervention in the petty quarrels between native tribes. With a view to the accomplishment of these ends, where force became necessary, none were suffered to take part except Her Majesty's troops, for any other course would have aggra-"], [235, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 203 vated and possibly perpetuated the evils the Commander-in- Chief desired to remedy. The Chief Moshesh, having evinced a disposition to tempo rise, was severely punished, and mulcted of 9000 head of cattle, partly by surrender and partly by force, as a just penalty for the plunder committed by his people during the war of reta liation; and, having made due submission, that chief, instead of now being a troublesome enemy, has become a most loyal and well-disposed subject. Not a single case of cattle thefts, or aggressions of any kind, is chargeable to his people, or those of his tributary chiefs, since the date of his submission. Com mercial intercourse has now been resumed between the farmers and the Basutos, and peace and confidence are restored. 2nd. The next frontier district, descending towards the south, is the district of Albert. The warfare carried on between the inhabitants of this dis trict, who are almost all of Dutch extraction, and their abori ginal neighbours, was chiefly with the people of the Chief \" Morosi,\" who is a dependant of Moshesh, in conjunction with some Tambookies then in rebelbon ; but since the submission of Moshesh, this war of retaliation, which lasted for two years, and in which it is equally doubtful which party may be charged with the original aggression, and which had the ultimate ad vantage, has entirely ceased ; and uninterrupted tranquilbty, security, and confidence have continued ever since the peace with the Tambookies and Moshesh along that frontier. In that country \u2014 the rural population being almost exclu sively Dutch \u2014 the old organisation under field-cornets, with a very active Civil Commissioner, Mr. Cole, being in force, and peace with Moshesh and Morosi having been restored, all that is now necessary for security and protection is accomplished, without the aid of troops, paid levies, or police ; and so long as faith is kept by the colonists with Moshesh and Morosi on the one hand, and the Tambookies on the other, there is no cause to apprehend any disturbance of the peace in that quarter."], [236, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 204 But the tendency of some of the farmers in those remote dis tricts to encroach on their Tambookie neighbours who are within the colonial boundary, and, as British subjects, equally entitled with themselves to the protection of the British Govern ment and of colonial laws, must be restrained by legal means whenever occasion may be given for it. This has been duly made known to them. 3rd. The district of North Victoria was the scene of much trouble during the war of rebelbon, in which a large portion of the Tambookie race, associated with rebel Hottentots, was implicated. Papers laid before Parliament, 20th March, 1851, as well as the result of an inquiry instituted by the Governor previously to bis final adjustment of the Tambookie question, and pro clamation of pardon, will show that the propensity to encroach, on the part of certain members of the burgher population already noticed, in defiance of the faith of the British Govern ment pledged to the Tambookies, cannot be excluded from the consideration of the origin of this particular portion of the general frontier warfare. This is only noticed here, however, to explain the policy by which the Governor and Commander-in-Chief has now sought to restore peace on a lasting basis, in this and other analogous cases. A river, unless it he a very large one, not fordable and con stantly flowing, though plausible and convenient on a map, is the most inefficient demarcation that can be adopted as a boundary between tribes, aud still more so in and between the lands of different races; whilst mountain ridges, abrupt aud strongly defined, as they are in this country, or even straight lines marked by main roads, are far more practically efficient than small streams winding through pastures, aud affording common drinkiug-places for the cattle of different races ; sup posed exclusive possessors and occupants of the land on their respective banks."], [237, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 205 To remove this fertile source of quarrel, afforded by the old limits, and as a just punishment for their participation in rebel lion, the Tambookies have now been confined within a well defined mountain boundary, with ample space and a fair share of good land. With this allotment they are perfectly satisfied, and for it they are most grateful. Nothing can be more exem plary than their conduct aud their implicit obedience to the resident, Mr. Warner, who is a very worthy man, and highly esteemed ; and since the proclamation of pardon of the 22nd November, 1852, there has not been a single case of cattle theft or collision with the burghers chargeable to the Tam bookies. Nevertheless, there has been more than one applica tion from the burghers, not content with the great extent of land forfeited and available for their benefit, to induce the Governor to give them lands which they covet within the pro claimed boundary, \u2014 and thus break faith with the Tambookies. It is unnecessary to say that such covetous appbcations have been duly rejected with reprehension, and caution against attempting encroachment ; for it is evident the main secret of governing these native tribes is inviolable good faith, \u2014 an innate sense of justice and truth being perhaps the only virtue they can appreciate, and for which they have among them selves, as well as in their intercourse with others, a natural respect. This opinion is, perhaps, contrary to colonial prejudices. It is nevertheless true, and should be respected ; not only on mo tives of justice, but of policy. Unless a country from which an enemy has been expelled, and which is for the time vacant, be immediately occupied in an efficient manner, it is manifest that either the original owners will return to it, or it will become tenanted by lawless squatters, and probably by thieves and robbers. The Governor, therefore, lost no time in making arrange ments for a regular and well-organised occupation of this coun try, which lies between the Zwart Kei and the Tambookie"], [238, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 206 boundary; and his endeavours to fill up that important vacuum by a sufficiently dense population, and under a sufficient organi sation for mutual support and self-defence, have been attended with complete success, zealously and ably seconded as he has been by Mr. Calderwood, Civil Commissioner of the district, Mr. Shepstone, Assistant Civil Commissioner, Messrs. Bowker and Zeiler, and Mr. Robinson, First Assistant Surveyor Ge neral, and especially by the talented and judicious arrange ments of this last-named member of a Commission appointed for the purpose, by whose exertions a promising town of some thirty bouses has already sprung up, and about 300 farmers, \" bona fide\" occupants, and carefully selected from a list of 800 candidates, have been located. Thus the Commander-in-Chief has been able to withdraw military support, and the security of this district is sufficiently provided for by a body of 50 mounted police, to be borne as a part of the colonial charge under that head, from the 1st of April. If sanctioned by the British Government, it is proposed to transfer the Windvogelberg country, north of the Amatolas and south of the Black Kei, aud now part of British Kaffraria, to the colony, and join it with North Victoria. The acquisition to the colony now suggested, would be filled with a burgher population also. And it is proposed in that case to divide the district of Victoria into two separate districts, for it is already too extensive for one ; and to constitute this, the northern half, the district of Queen's Town, which is the name of the new town situated in its centre. This arrangement, if properly car ried out, will cover all that part of the colony against any future attempted Kafir inroads, without calling for military aid; for it is an open country, in which unorganised Kafirs, however numerous, can make no head against a mounted and resolute burgher force. 4th. Now to descend the frontier line to the Kat River Set tlement : \u2014"], [239, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 207 There has been lately sitting at Eland's Post, and is at pre sent sitting in Graham's Town, a special Commission, composed of Mr. Assistant Commissioner Owen, Mr. Acting Assistant Commissioner Ebden, and Mr. Calderwood, Civil Commis sioner of Victoria. The object of this investigation is not as to the origin of the rebellion, or any retrospective inquiries further than may be conducive to the present practical settlement of that district, so that this last remaining cicatrice left by the recent troubles may be healed, and steps taken to break up an exclusive na tional settlement, \u2014 a measure which has proved not only a failure, but attended with dangerous and inconvenient conse quences, prejudicial alike to the inhabitants themselves and to the community at large. It is also intended that no time be lost in the establishment of another village at Blinkwater, which is at the entrance of the Kat River Settlement, or district of Stockenstrom as it has been called, in which may be brought together a respectable and industrious population, of a class to supply honest labour ers as well as men capable of uniting for efficient self-defence, and as an example in this country, to show that men can live in communities here as well as in every other part of the world, and not exclusively on farms of 6000 acres in extent, with lone dwellings 15 miles apart. In short, there must be a provision for servants as well as for masters, and until they do establish villages as well as farmsteads, they never can expect a working population, or if emigrants came out that they could be induced to stay. Whilst, on the other hand, in well-irrigated villages, sites for which abound, there is no country in the world where a man with a family, and little or no capital, could thrive better, if given an erf of half an acre or one acre at most, with suffi cient commonage for pasture of his cow or cows. With a pig and a few goats, and a spade and axe, he might support his family ; \u2014 and where labour is now at 6*. or 7s. or even 8s. a-day,\u2014 he and his sons working at half that rate might earn an"], [240, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 208 independence, with far more certainty than nine- tenths of the more ambitious speculators in land, and with far more benefit to society. To enable a colony to prosper, there must be a just propor tion of farm owners and farm servants. The Hottentot rebellion is entirely extinct. There are many absentees who cannot be accounted for, but they are glad to keep out of the way of the police and of the law, and having taken up their abode in distant countries, it is expected that most of them will settle as the Griquas, Bastards, aud Coran nas did of old, and that there is not much further inconve nience to be apprehended from them. The almost total disappearance of all Hottentot thieves in the bush is very remarkable ; the pobce can rarely find a trace of them since the last encounter four months ago, in which, out of a gang of forty, upwards of twenty were hunted up and killed by the pobce, assisted by a detachment of the 12th Foot. Nevertheless, it is impossible to say, that as they now meet with little sympathy from the Kafirs, some bauds may not return, and try to live by plunder within the colony. 5th. The next district is South Victoria, which gives the colonial boundary to the southern extremity of the line for merly called the Ceded Territory ; and this must be considered in conjunction with the districts of Fort Beaufort and Albany, the interests of all three, in case of frontier warfare, being in separably connected. Since the total and final clearance of the Kroome Mountains and Waterkloof, on the loth, 16th, and 17th September, 1852, and the estabbsbment of three military posts therein, perfect tranquillity and security from all cattle-stealing prevails in the district of Fort Beaufort, and in those of Cradock and Somer set, which formerly suffered so severely from that nuisance, but which are now far removed from any hostile influences or cause of alarm. Three companies are at present required for the military"], [241, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 209 occupation of the Blinkwater post, and those on the Kroome Mountains and Waterkloof; but if the intended sufficient vil lage can be established at Bbnkwater, which is at present only a military post, and the neighbouring valleys occupied by re spectable and resolute farmers, very little military aid will be required to establish permanent security in that quarter. The two remarkable tracts of dense sorest, which follow the course of the rivers Kat and Fish, and the rivers Chumie and Keiskamma, comprising between them the frontier district of South Victoria, hitherto so formidable as a shelter for maraud ing bands of Kafirs and Hottentots, and which in April, 1852, may be said to have been entirely in their possession, are now constantly patrolled by the police and by parties of Her Ma jesty's troops from the Konap post and Fort Brown, Trum peter's and Line Drift, but rarely the trace of a stray wanderer can be found in any corner of their former retreats ; and never at any previous period of frontier history has there been a more complete absence of all thieving and outrage in those parts than during the last four months. This is more than there is any right to expect ; and the continuance of so desirable, but sudden and almost preternatural state of things, should not yet be too confidently trusted to, and is not. However, it is now sufficiently evident, that in this respect a permanent advantage has been gained which the police will suffice to keep, provided that, when that force shall become a colonial charge, it be not, through false economy, enervated or reduced to an inefficient state. The present establishment and annual cost is as per margin,* and possibly some further reduction may be practicable when another measure, which will be adverted to next, comes into operation. 6th.

Their numbers may amount in all to 7000 males, capable of bearing arms ; but they live under their respective head men, in small distinct communities, and have no national organisation or union. These people have always proved true and faithful; and have, during the late war, when enrolled in companies under European officers, done good and gallant service against the Kafirs, to whom they are quite equal as warriors, in every respect. As the natural consequence during the progress of a warlike contest, then ancient enmity against their former oppressors ripened into a mortal hatred, and in proportion as they have become estranged from the Kafirs, they have become attached to the Europeans, and especially Her Majesty's troops, with whom they served, and who used them well. This people have made greater advances towards civilisation than the Kafirs seem capable of; and as they are placed in the intermediate frontier country, between the Kafirs and the co lonists, it is most desirable to keep them attached to us, and available at any moment, not only in small detachments as a support to the police, but in a state of sufficient organisation and control to turn out as an efficient armed force of 1000 strong, or upwards, at a day's notice, to assist in repelling attempted invasion, or in support of general colonial interests and the safety of the community, in quelhng any Hottentot or other insurrection. In their present temper and disposition they would be ready to join Her Majesty's troops, who are here for the protection of the colony, heart and hand, in any case in which they might be called upon to act. They are capable of becoming, in respect"], [243, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 211 to the mibtary exigencies of this colony in Africa, what the Sepoys are to those of the East India Company in Asia ; and whilst it is pobtic to encourage the existing state of things in respect to the Fingoes, neglect, ill usage, or breach of faith towards them, might make them formidable enemies, and trou blesome to deal with. With these views, there are now enrolled four militia com panies, of sixty men each, at a trifling expense;* and this small force, as well as the police, it is intended should be main tained at the cost of the colony. Further particulars respecting the constitution and rates of pay of these two descriptions of border pobce will be found in the Appendix, letter Q. Further particulars under this bead will be laid before you when opportunity offers, for providing for this expenditure during the interval that must necessarily elapse before the constitutional Parliament can enter upon its legitimate func tions. When that time arrives other more serious considerations will present themselves, as to manner in which, and how far, this colony may provide for or contribute to its own security and defence, and maintain or improve the advantages that have been gained. Fifty of the old Kafir police have remained faithful through out the war, and have done good service. These have been retained, not only in justice to their merits, and as an encou ragement and example, hut because their services are essential, not as a force, but as a pobce, to enable the T'Slambie and Gaika Commissioners to carry on their duty without having recourse to military intervention in time of peace, when civil authority will suffice. But as this pobce is a remnant of that long since established, organised on the same principle, and at the same rate of pay, * id. per diem without rations or allowance, except when attached to some regiment or sent out from their location.

SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 212 and is exclusively required for Kaffrarian duty, it is already provided for in the Schedule to the Appropriation Ordinance, under the head of Border Department (Aborigines). 7. As an additional measure to provide for the security of the frontier hereafter, without the aid of Her Majesty's troops, clusters of farms in Victoria are now being established, so arranged that the farmhouses may be placed within reach of mutual support. There are, already, numerous applications from respectable young farmers of some capital, and bond fide occupants, a point which is insisted upon ; among them, one party of eighteen gallant aud enterprising burghers, who have done good service during the war, have already been placed, according to their own desire, on farms of 2000 acres each, along the banks of the Keiskamma, an advanced position which they are well calculated to maintain, and, well supported by the police and Fingoe companies, have no fears about it. This system would have been extended along the whole line were it not that no less than eight farms had been previously sold without covenant as to occupancy; a pernicious system, by which they have fallen into the hands of one or two land speculators, whose right of property must be respected, but whose monopoly only serves to keep the honest farmer and bond fide occupant out of them. When the above measures are fully realised, there will scarcely be any occasion for regular Troops within the colonial boundary at all, so long as the one great advanced post of British Kaffraria be maintained. 8. With reference to British Kaffraria, the information re ceived from the Chief Commissioner and the Gaika Commis sioner continues to be perfectly satisfactory, and the Gaika Tribes, lately in rebellion, appear to be sitting down contentedly in their new location. As to the portion of British Kaffraria immediately adjoining the colonial border, the conduct of the Chief Siwani and his tribe, who occupy the greater portion of a broad margin on"], [245, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 213 the left bank of the Keiskamma, is most exemplary, and his fidelity throughout the whole contest gives full confidence not only in his good faith, but in his power to restrain his people from lawless intrusion into the colony. The remaining portion of that margin, reaching to the Royal Reserve, which is in military occupation, formerly the possession and stronghold of the marauding Chiefs Stock and Tola, and which, from its intricate nature, would, under present circum stances, be untenable by Europeans, is now occupied by the loyal Chief Kama, who, entirely with his own consent, and at his own desire, has migrated from the neighbourhood of Whit tlesea with his people, and taken possession of it. This faithful chief, and his sons and people, did good ser vice during the late rebelbon, as paid levies, on the side of the British Government against the Chief Kreili and the Tambookies. By this migration, not only the last remaining Kafir chief within the colony will have removed beyond the border, but a chain of trustworthy and loyal chiefs will be placed in contact with the colony, in the room of the lawless and restless occu pants who have hitherto tenanted the woods and kloofs of the Keiskamma. The T'Slambie tribes, now the only Kafir neighbours conti guous to the colony, are fuUy aware of the advantages they enjoy as the fruits of their fidelity to the British Government in the late contest, and are convinced that loyalty has proved better policy than rebellion. Granting no better motive, self-interest would probably now afford sufficient security for their good conduct, and if they be firmly but fairly dealt with, there is no risk of contumacy on their part. Should, however, at any time, a spirit of insubor dination be kindled amongst them, they also well know that \" the tables have been turned ; \" they haveno longer the Amato las to fly to as their rallying point, for that great natural citadel is now in entire possession of a British garrison, and, com-"], [246, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 214 v man ding all British Kaffraria, stands in the midst of them, ready to crush insurrection in embryo. So long as the Amatolas and Royal Reserve can be main tained, the Gaikas in their new location will be easily controlled by the increasing population in the former deserted though profitable country of the Windvogelberg, which, it is proposed, shall form part of the new district of Queen's Town, or North Victoria, for it is almost all an open country. 9. By a report received from the British Resident to the \" Transkeian\" tribes, it appears that the state of feebng among the Kafir nations, extending to the frontier of Natal, is most favourable. 10. The general aspect of affairs induced the Governor, after consulting the Executive Council, to abrogate martial law in the districts of Graaf-Reinet, Cradock, Somerset, Uitenhage, and Port Elizabeth, while retaining that power in the frontier districts of Albany, Victoria, Albert, and Fort Beaufort, for the reasons stated in the Proclamation of the 23rd March, 1853. It is confidently hoped, that very shortly it will be only necessary to retain the power of martial law in the one district of Victoria, which gives the immediate boundary between the colony and Kaffraria. On the return of the Governor from the Orange River terri tory, rebellion having now been driven, as it were, into a corner, and without escape, the crisis had arrived when it be came necessary for the authority to whose discretion the con duct of the war had been entrusted, to consider and decide as to its termination, and act accordingly, on his own respon sibility. It is easy for idle lookers-on, who are not called upon to act, and are not responsible for the practical result, to indulge in wild speculations, but the man of action and responsibility must think deeply, consider relative circumstances, ascertain possibilities, and look far and deliberately into consequences ;"], [247, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 215 hence, the matured judgment on which the latter acts, when made manifest, is apt to prove widely different from the hasty and vague theories and anticipations which preoccupy the pubbc mind. Circumstances may be improved ; judgment, patience, and perseverance may do much in this respect, hut the nature of things, as preordained by the Creator and Ruler of all things, cannot be subverted by man. The most wholesome conclusion of a long-protracted and wide-spread rebellion is, that sufficient precautions should have followed its gradual suppression, so as to provide against even the partial recurrence of any of its evil influences, and thereby render the ultimate cure as effectual and lasting as human means can accomplish. Complete submission has been obtained, not by treaty, but by force of arms, and the same sufficient power is retained to enforce its observance. The whole colony has been cleared of rebels ; the Gaikas have been entirely expelled from the Amatolas and all their former possessions ; peace has been restored along the whole extent of frontier ; and rebelbon is extinct, and, with \" equal steps,\" measures have been taken to secure all advantages that had been gained. These, it is confidently hoped, when fully matured and developed in time of peace, will give the greatest amount of security which those who, in a savage land, nobly venture as the advance guard in the progress of colonisation, can expect to enjoy. The impartial and candid observer of facts may probably admit, that at no former period did the frontier affairs of this Colony present a more favourable aspect than at this time. George Cathcart, Governor, and Commander-in-Chief. <"], [248, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 216 APPENDIX TO MINUTE. A. Extract of Despatch No. 23,/coto Earl Grey to His Excellency Lieut.-General the Hon. George Cathcart, Governor, &c, dated February 2nd, 1852. \" Having thus explained the effect and objects of the various formal instruments I now transmit to you, I have little to add to the instruc tions already given to your predecessor, as to the exercise of the powers thus conferred upon you. It is obvious that on your assumption of the Government of the Cape of Good Hope, and the command of Her Majesty's troops now employed there, the object of paramount im portance to which your attention must in the first instance be directed, is that of bringing to a close, at the earliest possible period, by the complete subjugation of the hostile Kafirs, the distressing and harassing war of which the eastern frontier of the colony has for the last year been the scene. Whatever may be the policy to be hereafter adopted, it is universally agreed by all who have considered the subject, and are acquainted with the existing situation of affairs, that, be the causes of this unfortunate state of things what they may (on which much difference of opinion prevails), it is absolutely necessary that the war, begun with so little provocation, and in so treacherous a manner, by the Kafirs and Hottentots, should be prosecuted with unremitting vigour, until it can be finished by their being reduced to complete and unconditional submission. I trust that the very considerable force which you will find at your disposal when you reach the Cape, will enable you to accomplish this object, and that the termination of the war may not much longer be delayed. \" When this has been effected, the measures to be adopted for the purpose of guarding against the recurrence of a similar calamity, will require your most careful and deliberate consideration. The events of the last twenty years too clearly demonstrate the absolute necessity of a revision of the system of policy hitherto pursued on the Cape frontier, in order that the best precautions which the cir cumstances admit of may be taken against the periodical renewal of the grievous losses and sufferings inflicted upon the colonists, and the heavy pecuniary burden entailed on the mother country by suc cessive Kafir wars. I have, therefore, to instruct you to consider, with the Assistant Commissioners, who have already been sent to the Cape, the state in which affairs may be left on the termination of the war, and to prepare, for the information of Her Majesty's Government, and of Parliament, a report, fully explaining your views as to the policy to be hereafter adopted, and the measures to"], [249, "217 CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. which you look, as being best calculated to guard against the evils which have been experienced. In preparing such a report, you will exercise the fullest and most unlimited discretion in recommending for the consideration of Her Majesty's Government the course which may appear the best to your own judgment, without regarding your self as in any degree bound by the instructions which have been given, or the views which have been expressed by myself or by pre ceding Secretaries of State, to former Governors of the Cape. You will consider only what are the measures best calculated to meet the just claims and to promote the true and permanent interests of Her Majesty's subjects, both in this colony and in the mother country. \" In looking at the subject in this light, you will not fail to bear in mind, that, while it is due to those persons and their descendants who were induced, with the direct sanction of Parliament, to leave this country, for the purpose of settling in the eastern division of the colony, that they should not be abandoned without aid or sup port in a position of so much danger, their right to look for the support of the mother country is by no means without its limits ; and that it depends upon their not failing to make those exertions which may reasonably be expected for their own protection, and to conform to those rules of conduct which may be necessary for their safety. In like manner, there are other considerations affecting the native races which ought not to be lost sight of. If colonists of European descent are to be left unsupported by the power of the mother country, to rely solely on themselves for protection from fierce barbarians, with whom they are placed in immediate contact, they must also be left to the unchecked exercise of those severe measures of self-defence, which a position of so much danger will naturally dictate. Experience shows that, in such circumstances, measures of self-defence will degenerate into indiscriminate ven geance, and will lead to the gradual extermination of the less civilised race. To avert this result (which has hitherto been the aim of our policy), and, by the enforcement of order, to provide for the civilisation and conversion to Christianity of these barbarous tribes, instead of leaving them to be destroyed, is a high and noble object, well worthy of considerable sacrifice on the part of the Bri tish people. But, on the other hand, it is more than is required from them by the duties of humanity, that they should submit to the necessity of indefinite expense, and of a constant renewal of such costly efforts as have lately been made, in order to prevent the strife of hostile races, and maintain peace and security in the wide regions of Southern Africa, over which British power has been asserted."], [250, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 218 \" You are aware that, beyond the very limited extent of terri tority required for the security of the Cape of Good Hope as a naval station, the British Crown and nation have no interest whatever in maintaining any territorial dominion in Southern Africa, and that the only motives which can influence Parliament and Her Majesty's Government in doing so, are that sense of the claims upon them of those of Her Majesty's faithful subjects who are inhabitants of the colony, and that philanthropic desire to promote the civilisation and conversion of the tribes amongst whom they dwell, to which I have adverted. I have hitherto believed that, by a proper system of management, those for whose welfare it was alone desired that British power should be maintained in this distant region, might be made to understand their interest in supporting it, and that without any expense disproportion ed to the object in view, that object might be accomplished, and both the European and native races might be induced to yield obedience to the authority exercised by British officers for their benefit. This belief was encouraged by the success which, for nearly three years, appeared to have attended the mea sures adopted by Sir H. Smith ; and I looked forward with confi dence to the complete establishment of security, by the civilising effects of commerce and missionary enterprise, if the tranquillity and good order which had thus long been preserved could for a few years be continued. Unfortuuately, these sanguine hopes have been disappointed ; and it will be a question demanding the most serious consideration, whether the attempt which has thus failed can be renewed, or whether the exercise of British authority in South Africa must not be restricted within much narrower limits than heretofore. \" The answer to this most important question must greatly depend upon whether, by firm but conciliatory measures, you can allay those jealousies and animosities which have unfortunately di vided the colonists, and can unite them in supporting the Govern ment. With such united support from the colonists of European origin, I still see no reason for despairing that, by adopting a system of managing the native tribes, in which injudicious indulgence, and that forbearance which savages always attribute to weakness, should be no less carefully avoided than injustice, the security of the colony might be maintained without a heavier demand on the resources of this country than Parliament would probably be prepared to sanction. \"I have, &c, (Signed) \" Grey.\""], [251, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 219 B. On the 1st December, 1852, appeared Johannes Fortcin, who was apprehended on the night of the 27th November, 1852, at Graham's Town, together with his child Cupido Fortoin, and makes the following voluntary statement : \u2014 \" I enlisted with the Cape Corps Infantry, during Lord Charles Somerset's administration. I was then twenty years of age, and was enlisted at ' Genadendal.' I served twenty-three years, and was discharged, being sickly, and received a pension of two-peuce farthing per diem. I then went and resided at Theopolis for ten years; when the Kat River establishment was formed, I moved to that place, and where I resided until the war broke out. I possessed a plot of ground at Lushington, thirty-three breeding cattle, two spans of oxen, four horses, and one waggon. I was appointed the head of the party at Lushington by Sir Andrew Stockenstrom. On a certain Saturday, I went to my cattle place at the Mancazana, and I there saw the Hottentot ' Herma nus Booy,' who lived at Kat River, and he told me that the war had commenced. I asked him, what war? \u2014 he said that of the Hottentots. I had the day before received an order from Fort Beaufort, that I must instantly trek to Fort Armstrong, or to the post at Eland's River, and it was in consequence of this order that I had gone to my cattle place to get my stock. Hermanus Booy told me he had assisted ' Hermanus ' to attack Fort Beaufort, but they had been defeated with the loss of Hermanus, and many of his people. Upon hearing this, I said I should trek to Fort Armstrong, and I took my stock away to my dwelling-place. I got there on the Monday following, and there heard that Uithaal der had been there the day before, and stirred up the people to join in the war against the Government, and had appointed Jan Bannies as captain over all the people at Lushington. I told Jan Bannies I should trek to Fort Armstrong, but he said, we must go to the Eland's River where Uithaalder would come. We all went to Eland's River ; my wife, my son-in-law October Felix, who was a dis charged Cape Corps man, and had been an apprentice labourer, and my two children, proceeded to Fort Armstrong in my waggon, \u2014 my son, ' Nathaniel Fortuin,' and son-in-law ' Flink Oerson,' who was a Cape Corps deserter, and Philip Noka, a Gonah Hottentot, ac companied me to Eland's River, under Jan Bannies. Uithaalder came to us and desired Jan Bannies to command fourteen men to be in readiness to proceed with Sandilli to Philipton, to take the"], [252, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 220 Fingoes' cattle at that place. Sandilli came with four men, and while there, Uithaalder arrived with twenty-five men, and Sandilli left with him for Philipton, and they returned the next da}-, bring ing about thirty head of cattle, which Sandilli took away with him. Uithaalder brought seven oxen, which he handed over to Jan Ban nies to kill for his people, which he did, and Uithaalder then went away. My son Nathaniel told me they had taken the Fingoes' cattle at Philipton, and that he intended to join Uithaalder, which he did, also my two sons-in-law. Jan Bannies then treked from the Eland's River, taking all the cattle with him. I refused to join him, and so did four others, and we five returned to Lushington, and where we remained five months, living upon our garden stuff, of which there was abundance. There were two parties at this time at Eland's River, one party under the Field-cornets Cobus Fourie and Lodewyk Peffer, who were all well-disposed towards the Govern ment, and one party under Jan Bannies, who were opposed to Government, and each party were encamped on opposite sides of the river. Jan Bannies treked with his party, leaving the Govern ment people behind, but he took all their stock from them. Cobus Fourie's party was very small, and when I left Eland's River, they were still there. While I was at Lushington with the five men, I heard that Fort Armstrong had been attacked by General Somerset. I afterwards beard that Fourie's waggons had been taken by General Somerset, but were restored on hearing that his people were well disposed. I then proceeded to the school Kafirs at the Chumie, where I remained until they separated and joined the war-party. I then proceeded to the Amatola to Uithaalder, where my son and sons-in-law were. Uithaalder appointed me magistrate, to inquire into complaints and inflict punishments. The complaints I inquired into were, when parties were ordered to go on commando, and made excuses. I used to fine them, and occasionally inflict corporal punishment with a stirrup leather, if their excuse was not a lawful one. I only considered two excuses were lawful, viz. sickness, or being foot-sore, and all other excuses were punishable. Uithaalder has a code of laws, written in a book, and which he handed to me for my guidance, and I acted accordingly. Gert Erasmus wrote these laws. On one occasion two men, named ' Booy Lantjes ' and ' Philip Laager,' were brought before me for trial, under the follow ing circumstances : \u2014 Jan Cornelis was the commandant, and had left with a large force to steal cattle in the colony ; he had sent these two men to a hill some distance off, to spy where cattle were to be seen, and to return and report the same to him ; but these two men returned to Uithaalder, saying they had seen cattle,"], [253, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 221 but that, Jan Cornelis having left the place, they could not find him ; and Uithaalder desired me to inquire into this matter when Jan Cornelis should return, which he did three days afterwards. I then heard the evidence, and found that Jan Cornelis had not re mained at the spot, which he said he should do, until the return of the two spies, but had left and gone in an opposite direction, and the two men had missed him ; consequently I acquitted them. Uithaalder became dissatisfied with my decision, because one of his laws was death for any man to turn back on commando. Jan Cornelis was satisfied with my judgment, and admitted they were not to blame, as he had moved sooner than he intended, and had the two men followed him, they would have been shot, as the Go vernment patrols were very active ; but Uithaalder was displeased, because I did not pass sentence of death according to his laws ; and therefore took back his book of laws, and dismissed me, and ap pointed Frederick Hendricks in my place. When Jan Cornelis returned from this commando, he brought back a great many cattle, and I think eleven horses, saying he had taken them from Clayton's place, at the mouth of the Fish River, and where they had shot two white men. Hans Brander was with Jan Cornelis on this commando. Frederick, whose surname I forget, but who was a Cape Corps deserter, was the commandant of the party which attacked the military waggons on the Koonap, and captured some rifles, gunpowder, and clothing. Stephanus Smit was a captain, and of that party. Frederick was subsequently wounded by a patrol near King William's Town, and then hung up on a tree. I had heard of this, and sent to see if it was true, and I saw him still hanging three days afterwards. When the Cape Corps deserters saw this, they became alarmed, and said they would have to suffer the same punishment. Stephanus Smit was the captain of the party that murdered James at the Winterberg. Hans Brander left the Amatola nearly two months ago, with a large party for Zuurberg, saying he could reach that part by going through Albany, for the boers waylaid all the drifts in the Somerset district, and it would be too dangerous to attempt that road. Africander Lavelot left, with sixteen men and some women and children, for the colony, some time before Hans Brander ; none of them have as yet returned. Flink Oerson, my son-in-law, and Cupido, a Gouah Hot tentot, who went with Hans Brander, returned twenty days after wards, saying they were foot-sore, and brought a report from Hans Brander that two of his men had been shot in the Kowie. These two men's feet were very much swollen, and Flink Oerson is still"], [254, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 222 lame therefrom ; and Uithaalder inspected them, and admitted they were justified in returning. Frederick Jack, who has surrendered himself, was with the patrol that took the cattle from Clayton's ; he was with the patrol that attacked the waggons at the Koonap ; he was not with the patrol that murdered James ; he was not with the patrol that took the cattle, some time ago, from Fort Hare. He has been on many patrols ; but I only remember his being on two where murders were committed. I know all that went out, because I am the person who was appointed by Uithaalder to name the parties to go out, and all reports were brought to me, and I reported the same to Uithaalder. We noticed no reports, except such as were officially made by the captains on their return. The captains got Gert Erasmus to write their reports, and he accompanied them to me, and I then proceeded with them to Uithaalder, to whom Gert Erasmus read. I cannot read manuscript, nor Uithaalder. Uithaal der has a book, in which is written the number of persons his patrols have killed from time to time, which is a long list; and the names of his men that are killed and wounded. I never heard how many of the Government people were killed. When Uithaalder dismissed me, all the men were desired to fall in, and the book in which was recorded all I had done, during my magisterial authority, was read in their presence, and it enumerated 120 as killed, and twenty- five disabled : this did not include the losses at Fort Arm strong. Gert Erasmus did not state the losses of the English. Some of the disabled have lost an arm, and some a leg. We had no doctor, and the limbs rot off, when herbs are applied, and the wounds heal up. Since this period, I have heard of a great many more having fallen on Uithaalder's side. This book was only made up from the official reports of the commandants and captains, who went out and returned with the patrols. We frequently heard of men being killed, but never noticed such reports. Uithaalder was styled ' Koning ' (King), and every captain had to make his report to him. I think the book will now show 200 as killed on Uithaal der's side. Many have been shot in the colony, but, as I stated before, we did not notice them, because they were not under any captain at the time they fell. Before we went to the Waterkloof, all the Hottentots came together in the Amatola, for the purpose of ascertaining our strength. Uithaalder counted the men, and Gert Erasmus wrote down their names, and from whence they came. Uithaalder ordered every camp up to the Amatola for this object, and which order was strictly obeyed ; and then the number was 1500. I saw some Hottentots from Bethelsdorp there, but I can-"], [255, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 223 not say the number. I know there were thirty men from the missionary institution, 'Enon.' After the census was taken, every captain returned to his particular locality. We lost fifty men in the different engagements in the Waterkloof, and Macomo lost an im mense number of Kafirs there. I was present at the ' Pierie ' Bush when Sandilli came there, and had Uithaalder tied with a riem round the neck, for the purpose of handing him over to Government, be cause he would not make peace ; but Sandilli liberated him again. I was present when the woman came from Fort Beaufort with the Governor's proclamation. Uithaalder had all his men called together from the different camps. They came, and Gert Erasmus read it out. It was printed, and set forth the names of the prin cipal rebels, thirteen in number. It offered five hundred pounds for the apprehension of Uithaalder, and fifty pounds for the others, and the lives of all others would be spared. Every man perfectly under stood the meaning of the proclamation. We all understood our lives would be spared; but we should be tried for our rebellious conduct, and punished according to our deserts. Uithaalder said, any man that attempted to surrender should be disarmed and shot. All the captains gave out this order, and promised to enforce it. The men were much pleased with the proclamation, and talked amongst each other about surrendering. I heard many say they should do so whenever they had an opportunity. The following head-people heard the proclamation read : \u2014 ' Willem Uithaalder, Simon Paarl, David Laverlot, Gert Erasmus, and Frederick Hen drik.' Uithaalder sent David Laverlot with one of the proclamations (because the woman brought three copies) to Jan Bannies, who had gone to the Kei, and where Willem Brass, Tilman Marthinus, and Speelman Kieviet were ; and Kieviet Jaager brought a message back from Jan Bannies that he would not permit one of his men to surrender, and would shoot those that attempted to do so ; and that the other captains had promised the same. When the proclamation came, Jan Cornelis had been killed. Tilman Marthinus brought the report to Uithaalder of his death, saying they had taken some cattle belonging to the boers, who had pursued them, and shot Jan Cornelis dead. The bullet passed through his body. It had 'taken place in a flat across the Kei. Jan Cornelis wore a watch and a silver chain. I do not know where he got it. The following were with Hans Brander in the colony when the proclamation came, viz. Oerson Magerman and Klaas Love, consequently know nothing about it. Since the proclamation, the people are exceedingly dissatisfied with Uithaalder, and I think, before long, they will themselves hand him"], [256, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 224 over to Government. He has now become more arbitrary, and very great dissatisfaction is expressed. 'Jan Bannies,' ' Willem Brass,' and ' Speelman Kieviet ' took their families to the Kei ; but they, nevertheless, send men on commando to the colony. They have a great many cattle and horses, and merely went to the Kei to secure them. They have taken up their residence in a deep kloof, at the Kei, where the point of the Winterberg stretches into the Kei. It is not far from Biitterworth ; but, according to their accounts, higher up the river. They are at this side of the Kei. I was not there myself, but they have frequently described the place to me. Since Hans Brander left for the colony, ' Jan Bannies ' has sent a patrol from the Kei, comprising twenty men, under Kieviet Jaager, to the Zuurberg, in the colony. They came to Uithaalder in their route, and had been four days coming from the Kei. They rested one day at Uithaalder's, and then proceeded to the colony, and had not returned when I left. Formerly Uithaalder appointed twelve Heemraden, and I was their head; but, since my dismissal, he abo lished these appointments, for some reason ; and now Frederick Hendrick and Uithaalder settle all complaints themselves. Fre derick Jack was one of the Heemraden. The Kafirs will not fight any more. I have heard them say so. Macomo 's Kafirs are quite dispirited, and their ammunition expended. Uithaalder has fre quently asked Macomo and Sandilli to assist him with Kafirs; but they have refused, saying, the time is yet to come when we will fight, but at present they will sit still. Sandilli's Kafirs have tilled some land the other side of the Amatola. The corn is up. They have sown a great quantity. The Hottentots have always got their gunpowder from the friendly Kafirs, near King William's Town. Uithaalder got Sandilli's Kafirs to take cattle, and exchange with them for powder. I have seen them return with packages of cart ridges and loose powder. I do not know the names of the friendly Kafir chiefs whose people exchange the powder. Shortly before Hans Brander left on the last expedition to the colony, I saw him send two head of cattle, and Uithaalder, also, two head of cattle, to the friendly Kafirs for gunpowder. These were a portion of the cattle they had taken from Fort Hare. The Kafirs remained a week away, during which time Hans Brander left for the colony. The Kafirs brought back fifty packages for these four head of cattle. each packet containing ten rounds ; they brought no loose powder this time. The friendly Kafirs have supplied the Hottentots the whole war with powder. I beard that some Kafirs were in the levies, at King William's Town. Had it not been for the powder"], [257, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 225 we got from the friendly Kafirs, the war would have long been settled. We find greater difficulty in getting powder now, because the patrols are not so successful in taking cattle from the colony, and without cattle we cannot procure powder. Some short time ago, Stephanus Smit went with eighty-two men to Fort Beaufort, to steal cattle, thirty of whom were on foot, the rest were mounted. The third day, August Philis, who is brother to Stephanus Smit, came home with the commando, saying \"that my son-in-law, October Flux, had beeu flogged with a stirrup-leather at the Mancazana, and he had gone to Fort Beaufort, and brought a colonial patrol on them, in the poort where Mr. Calderwood formerly had a school, and four of their men were killed, and nine wounded. The following are the names of the killed : \u2014 Frans Laager, Cornelis Swart, Piet Jaager, and Jacob Prins. The following are the names of the wounded: \u2014 Jan O'Reilly, Klaas Abraham, O'Rie Wildschut, Jan de Klerk, Piet Piet, Jacobus Heudrik, Jontje de Vries, Jan Klaas, and Jan Cornelis. The latter died the following day. Six of the wounded cannot stand ; they are wounded in the body, and must die ; three had begun already to swell up when I left. August Philis hid the brown stallion which Stephanus Smit rode, and which he had taken from James's ; also the white mare had been shot dead. They then proceeded to Balfour, to waylay the cattle which were going from Eland's River to James's place, and they had succeeded in getting them ; but the people in charge of the cattle had shot Stephanus Smit dead. That August Philis then went off with the cattle ; but the levies at Eland's River recaptured them at the Chumie, killing Klaas, a Gonah. Upon August Philis reporting the loss he had sustained at Fort Beaufort, Uithaalder said I was the cause there, because Flux October, who had brought the patrol, was my son-in-law, and who slept and lived with me, and therefore I must have been cognisant of it. I denied all knowledge of the act, but Uithaalder still accused me, and said he should reckon off with me some day. My son Nathaniel told me that Uithaalder had said he would shoot me, and recommended my leaving. I left that night, bringing my child Cupido with me, telling him I was going to Graham's Town to search for honey, aud sell it in Graham's Town for clothing. We came along the high road from Breakfast Vley to Committee's Drift, at the Fish River, where the old post has been burnt off. I thought the post was still there, and intended surrendering myself; but, finding it burnt down, I came up the kloofs, along the Braak River, and arrived close to Graham's Town the fourth day. I intended goiug into the Cowie Bush to get some Q"], [258, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 226 honey, as I had remembered finding a bee's nest in a krantz, many years ago ; and I passed through the town, aud was proceeding to Woest's Hill, when I was apprehended near some waggons, and taken to the gaol. I had only left Uithaalder four days when I was appre hended. Uithaalder's camp was then in the Amatola, near a great krantz. He had sent all his cattle and horses away to Jan Bannies, at the Kei. After August Philis had returned from Beaufort, and reported the death of Stephanus Smit, he sent bis stock away. He had some cattle under Sandilli's charge, and he intended to get them, and then trek to the Kei to Jan Bannies. I never heard that Uithaalder was indebted to Macomo's Kafirs for gunpowder or the hire of guns. The Hottentots hire guns from both Macomo's and Sandilli's Kafirs to go on commando, for which they pay a calf ; but if the party is killed in action, and the gun thus lost, there is no charge made. The Kafirs hold the Hottentot leaders answerable for the payment of the hire of the guns. Before the war broke out, I never heard of such a rumour. I never heard the reason assigned by any of the Hottentots for their joining the war-party. I had no particular reason. I received my pension regularly, and without difficulty. I admit I am very guilty. I have found, to my cost, the ruinous result of my misconduct. Before the war, I possessed a place and stock, and in comfortable circumstances ; and now I am naked, half-starved, and penniless, and I thank the people for appre hending me, otherwise I should still have been in the bush. I could have remained with the Government party at the Eland's River, under Forie, if I liked ; but I followed my four sons to the Amatola, where I was nominated magistrate. Uithaalder had all the men called together. The book in which the code of laws was written was handed over to me, and then I made a solemn promise, in the presence of the men, that I would administer the laws ac- cording to that book, and Uithaalder publicly announced my appointment, and the men promised obedience to me. Frederick Hendrick was the adjutant, and he made the men fall in, and then I used to tell off the number that were to go on commando. I think Uithaalder had about 300 men with him when I left, exclusive of those who had gone to thi* Kei, and those absent on commando. Uithaalder is very short of ammunition. I was at Jan Cornelis's camp, at the Thorn Kloof, this side of the Kei, when Hans Brander left for the colony; and while at Jan Cornelis's camp, Tilman Marthinus returned there, with a commando, and said Jan Cornelis had been shot the day before. Tilman Marthinus has succeeded Jan Cornelis. When I left the Amatola, he was still at the Kei. They have erected huts"], [259, "227 CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. there, and have a good many cattle and horses there. It was reported that, when Uithaalder joined them, they would all establish themselves in the Deep Kloof, where Jan Bannies has taken up his residence. I was the first magistrate appointed.

The Commander of the Forces conveys his thanks to the army engaged against the Basutos at the Berea on the 20th instant, for their gallant conduct, and his admiration of their steadiness and discipline, by which an overwhelming host of Basutos and Bataungs were defeated, during a contest which lasted from early in the morn ing until 8 p.m., when the enemy, with a force of not less than 6000 well-armed horsemen, under considerable organisation, after repeatedly assailing the troops at every point, was driven from the field with such severe loss as to compel him to sue for peace."], [263, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 231 Nothing could surpass the valour displayed by every officer, non commissioned officer, and soldier on this long and trying day. His Excellency's personal observation could not embrace every part of so extended a field, or notice the separate parts taken by corps in the operations of the day ; but he marked with admiration the steady conduct of the three companies of the 43rd Regiment under Major Phillips, the gallant bearing of the detachment 12th Royal Lancers and Cape Mounted Riflemen, under Lieutenant Gough, 12th Lancers, and the admirable practice of the demi-battery of howitzers, under Captain Robinson, R.A., which formed the force immediately about his Excellency's person. Of the noble conduct of the division under Lieutenant-Colonel Eyre, composed of a detachment of 12th Lancers, Royal Artillery under Captain the Honourable G. Devereux, 73rd Regiment under Captain Bewes, one company Rifle Brigade under Lieutenant the Honourable L. Curzon, and a detachment Cape Mounted Riflemeu under Lieutenant Goodrich, his Excellency has only to regret that he could not be a witness to all the acts by which this division dis tinguished itself throughout the day. The cavalry brigade commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Napier, and composed of two squadrons of the 12th Lancers under Major Tottenham, and two squadrons Cape Mounted Riflemen under Major Somerset, merits equally the Commander of the Forces' commenda tion. This brigade having, with a spirit worthy of them, ascended the Berea Mountain, so little suited to cavalry movements, there captured and secured 4500 head of cattle, inflicting severe loss on the enemy, and brought the cattle into camp in spite of all endea vours of the enemy to recapture them. His Excellency having thus expressed his sense of the services performed by the corps under their immediate commanding officers, he derives much satisfaction in noticing more especially the officers in command ; and he returns his marked thanks to Lieutenant- Colonel Eyre, 73rd Regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Napier, Cape Mounted Riflemen, officers who this day nobly sustained the well known reputation they have long since established ; also to Major Pinckney, 73rd Regiment, and Captain Faddy, Commanding Royal Artillery, as well as the staff officers by whom they were assisted, Lieutenant Reeve, 73rd Regiment, acting brigade major, Lieu tenant Arthur Ponsonby, 43rd Regiment, acting aide-de-camp, Lieu tenant Whitmore, Cape Mounted Riflemen, acting brigade major.

Letter/'-cwi the British Resident to His Excellency the High Commissioner. Residency, April 14, 1853. Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to enclose for your Excellency's infor mation, copy of a letter which I addressed to the Chief Moshesh, on the 18th ultimo, with respect to an assault reported by the Civil Commissioner of Smithfield to have been committed by a Mosuto, on a farmer in his district. I have delayed sending this until I received Moshesh \"s reply, or acknowledgment of it, which the return messenger did not bring. I sent a second messenger; when I ascertained that Moshesh had at once put himself in communication with Mr. Vowe, and directed his brother, Paul Matete, to proceed to Beersheba, and hold the investigation as I had requested. I have just received a report from Mr. Vowe to the effect that he had met Paul Matete at Beersheba ; and the case of assault, which was fully proved against the Mosuto, had been settled to the satisfaction of all parties, by the Mosuto paying an ox to the farmer, in accordance with Paul Matete 's decision. If I can succeed in establishing such moveable tribunals as that at which this case has been decided, to settle frontier disputes between natives and whites, it will tend greatly to preserve amity between them. The idea occurred to me on my recent visit to"], [267, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 235 Moshesh, when he warmly approved of it, and promised co-operation in the carrying of it out, a promise which he has not neglected to fulfil. I have, of course, bound myself to give immediate attention and investigation to any complaint made by Moshesh 's subjects against their white neighbours. Another case of assault by a subject of Moshesh 's, on a farmer, occurred in the same neighbourhood, subsequently to my communi cation with the chief, regarding the first, and Paul Matete had secured the culprit, and wished Mr. Vowe to hear the case immedi ately after the settlement of the first one ; but Mr. Vowe refused, ou the plea of the want of instructions from myself. I regret he stood on such ceremony, as some delay must now occur, in conse quence of Mr. Vowe's attendance on the Court of Combined Magis trates which meets to-morrow.

Chief Moshesh, \u2014 On my return from your country, yesterday evening, I found a report awaiting me from the magistrate of the Caledon River District, to the following effect : \u2014 1st. \u2014 That he had received a letter from Field-cornet Klopper, complaining that the cattle of the Beersheba natives were con stantly trespassing on his farm. That they even brought, daily, a herd of cattle (about 400 in number) to drink at a dam which he had constructed at a considerable expense, within 25 yards of his dwelling-house, notwithstanding his frequent remonstrances with the Petty Chief of Beersheba. 2dly. \u2014 That Mr. Klopper further stated, that on the morning of the 7th March, Mr. Heudrick Koester, being annoyed with the number of cattle belonging to Basutos, on his homestead, he got Mr. Stephanus Terblance to assist him in driving them in the direction of Beersheba (distant about 14 miles). That when they had driven them about half a mile from the homestead, they met a Mosuto, of whom they inquired whether he was the herd of the cattle. The Mosuto, without answering the question, threw stones"], [268, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 236 at Terblance, two of which struck him and knocked him off bis horse. Mr. Koester picked him up, and they returned home, with out pursuing the Mosuto ; and they made an immediate report of the affair to their Field-cornet. I look with confidence to the words spoken by you at our late meeting, that you would grant speedy redress to any white man injured by your people ; it remains, therefore, but for me to con vince you of the truth of the circumstances mentioned, to afford you an opportunity to carry your promise into effect. I beg, therefore, that you will appoint a day for investigating the matter, at Beersheba. before the end of the present month, and I will direct Mr. Vowe to attend with the requisite evidence. You should at once compel the Petty Chief, Molitse, to restrain his people within the bounds of Beersheba lands ; otherwise, I fear a collision with the farmers. I remain, &c. &c, (Signed) Heney Green, British Resident. H. Reply of His Excellency the Governor to an Address from the Inhabitants of Smithfield. Head-Quarters, Camp near Smithfield, December 28, 1852. Gentlemen, \u2014 I came to this part of Her Majesty's domi nions to administer equal justice to all classes of her subjects. I found that the chief grievance was in the alleged plunder ing of your cattle by the Basuto nation, of which the Chief Moshesh is paramount. I found that my predecessor had in a manner pledged himself to restitution of any cattle you lose, and for which the Chief Moshesh was held responsible. A careful investigation made by the Resident, and further inquiry by my Assistant Commissioners, convinced me, that although the whole amount of loss could not be traced to that source, there was sufficient ground; \u2014 and that it had become a duty for me to demand a fine, and take such measures as I might think most conducive to punish the offender and prevent the evil in future \u2014 and at the same time it was no less my duty"], [269, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 237 to re-establisli, as far as was in my power, peace and good understanding between you and the Basutos, and security to your farms and dwellings. You are aware of the measures I have taken, and I rejoice to believe that the result will be peace and the comparative secu rity of your property, and that I leave you in & better state, if it be not disturbed by your own indiscretion, than I found you. This fact time must prove. In the meantime, after making a just appropriation, as a reward for their loyalty, to Moroko, Gert Taaibosch, aud Carrolus Batjie, I have placed the larger portion of the captured cattle at the disposal of the Resident, to be given in compensation for your losses. I wish you dis tinctly to understand, that I do so as a boon and not as a right ; and that I do not recognise the principle of my prede cessor in this respect ; for although the Executive is bound, for the protection of the subjects of the State, to punish the thief, the Executive is not bound, and never undertakes to compen sate the loser by theft for the value of his loss; \u2014 such a prin ciple would be an encouragement to negligence, and even to fraud. In order to remove an excuse often made to me for loss on your part from the Basutos, that your hands are tied from self defence by orders or instructions of Government, and that if you had full liberty, such as was enjoyed under the commando system, you could take care of your own property ; \u2014 although I have not been able to find when any such restrictions were made, I have, under my own authority and responsibility, and under all the powers vested in me, given you, by proclamation, full licence for the protection and security and recovery of your property according to the commando system ; and I further de clare to you, that if in pursuit of your stolen property you kill the thief, I will bear you harmless \u2014 provided, of course, that you do not abuse that licence, and go beyond the necessity of the case. There are, I have reason to believe, persons in the Sove-"], [270, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 238 reignty who are disappointed that I did not, notwithstanding his submission, eat up and destroy the Chief Moshesh, in order that his rich lands might fall into other hands. Others again appear to have anticipated, with no disinclination, a protracted Basuto war, requiring, probably, the expenditure of a large amount of British money for its maintenance. But these, I hope, are few, and that the majority of upright and sensible men will agree with me, that it is not only just to Moshesh, but better for their own interests, that I refrained from carrying fire and sword into the territory of that chief, after his ample sub mission, and, I firmly believe, sincere and earnest desire to be \"no longer considered the Queen's enemy,\" not only because that course was just, but because, bad I burnt his kraals and corn-fields, and left you to yourselves, as I must do, for I have no authority to keep an army here, I should have left you in a state of war instead of peace, and your farms and corn-fields would not have been safe, as I bebeve them now to be.

Lieut.-General Sir Geoege Cathcart, G.C.B., Governor, and Her Majesty's High Com- missioner, &c, &c, &c, Cape of Good Hope. The Memorial of the undersigned Field-cornets and Inhabitants of the District of Albany : Respectfully representeth, \u2014 That your memorialists find themselves in the painful necessity of laying their well-founded complaints before your Excellency, in the hope your Excellency will be graciously pleased to take their case into favourable con sideration. That your memorialists, before the outbreak of the war, always treated their then neighbours, the Tambookies, peaceably, notwith standing the frequent robberies they committed ; your memorialists did their utmost to keep the peace. R"], [274, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 242 That about that time, your memorialists entered into a treaty with the Tambookies and their chiefs, by which it was agreed, that the Tambookies, within eight days after the agreement, should depart a little away from the line of frontier, to which the chiefs signed their names. That your memorialists were, trusting them, treasonably deceived in following them on their word, till near a bushy part of the country, when the vagabonds instantly commenced to fire upon your memorialists, and continued to rob and burn all around, and the war and depredations are still going on, since the beginning of 1851 ; and the loss of many lives of Her Majesty's loyal subjects, and the ruin of many families, is the result of the treachery of these cunning marauders and murderers. That your memorialists respectfully pray, in case your Excellency should be pleased to resolve to a treaty of peace with the Tam bookie nation, not to allow them to settle, or locate them, on the same lands as formerly, as your memorialists have paid too dearly before last war, through their deception ; but to grant to your memorialists the lands formerly occupied by the Tambookies, on the same plan and condition as to lands lately granted to the inha bitants of the new field-coruetcies opposite the Sternberg's Spruit, in quit-rent. And your memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray, &c. Signed by 1 Field-commandant, 5 Field-cornets, and 135 Inhabitants. A true copy, translated, J. G. Bender, Sen. Burghersdorp, 26th November, 1852. Reply to the above Memorial. Burghersdorp, November 29, 1852. Gentlemen, \u2014 His Excellency has received and read your Me morial. He observes, with some surprise, that in the third paragraph you seem to found a claim upon what you call a treaty, signed by certain Commandants and Field-cornets, and by Mr. Warner, in presence of one minor Tambookie chief, Tyopo. You ought to be aware that those who were parties to that transaction were guilty of an unlawful act of aggression of a very grave nature. A treaty can"], [275, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 243 only be made between two lawful sovereign Powers or Governments. The Tambookies, as well as the Burghers within the limits of the colonial boundary, are Her Majesty's subjects, aud, holding their lands from their common Sovereign, are entitled to the same pro tection of their rights by the Government of the sovereign power which granted them. When a body of armed subjects went and dispossessed, by force and threats, another body of subjects of part of their lawful pos sessions, and presumed to call it a treaty, they were guilty of the same crime as in the case of one farmer taking possession, by similar means, of the lands of another farmer, both holding titles granted by their Sovereign. The original document alluded to is in my possession. It was sent to my predecessor, Sir Harry Smith, and there is marked in pencil by him, on the document enclosing it, his strong expression of indignation at that unlawful proceeding, and an intention of prosecuting for it. All the circumstances of the case, as well as the origin and con duct of that part of the war of rebellion which took place in these northern districts, are well known to his Excellency, who not only made personal inquiry, and read all written reports and documents about it, but caused a commission to meet at Whittlesea, to ascer tain the truth of them ; and his Excellency arrived at the conclu sion that there had been faults on both sides, as is generally the case in all quarrels. Being, therefore, desirous to re-establish a lasting peace, his Excellency determined to forego all notice of particular faults and losses on both sides ; but weighing the one against the other, most carefully to decide, and in Her Majesty's name, subject to her approval and confirmation, mark out an equitable and well-defined mountain boundary between the colonists of European origin and the Tambookies, both classes being equally Her Majesty's subjects. This boundary has been proclaimed, and cannot be altered, and whichever party seeks to infringe it will be equally proceeded against, according to law. In the lands which have now been forfeited by the Tambookies, and which abound with water and vast plains of sweet grass, it is his Excellency's intention to form a town, called Queen's Town, and to grant, on quit-rent, farms of from 2000 to 3000 acres. A provisional land commission has accordingly been ordered to assemble at Whittlesea, as soon as pos sible, for carrying this measure into effect, to which commission all R 2"], [276, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 244 who desire to benefit must apply. Due notice will be given in the newspapers, as soon as it has been assembled. In the meantime, his Excellency calls upon all Commandants, Field-cornets, and Burghers in the border districts, to keep the peace, and to remind all those who may be discontented, of the precept of the tenth commandment, \u2014 not to covet that which is their neighbours', \u2014 not even Buffalo Dooms, for that place falls within the Tambookie line. (Signed) John Ayliff, Acting Secretary. To certain Burghers of the district of Albert. M. Memorandum to serve as General Instructions to a Commis- sion appointed to meet at Eland's Post. With a view to a termination of the troubles which have prevailed for the last two years, and the restoration of peace and good order, it is very desirable that some steps should be taken without delay towards the settlement of the Kat River. Even a knowledge that such an endeavour is being made with just and benevolent intentions, will do much to reclaim the misguided part of the Hottentot community, and to confirm those that have been loyal. I propose, therefore, that the two Assistant Commissioners, assisted by the Rev. Mr. Calderwood, should assemble at Eland's Post, as soon as convenient, and form a Board. The precise mode of proceeding of that Board I would leave to the Commission itself to arrange, when after a closer inspec tion of the existing state of things among the Hottentots, they may judge better than I now can as to what course would be best to pursue. I think the investigation of this Commission should, as one principal object, have in view the state of property and the"], [277, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 245 claims of those who have been faithful, as well as what lands may be considered forfeited or otherwise vacant, in order that a subsequent Land Commission may immediately follow, to give regular titles, and carry out the suggestions of the Commission for occupation of vacant or forfeited property by a mixed com munity. Also I wish to be advised as to a fit person to be appointed Resident Magistrate at Eland's Post, an appointment which I think necessary, and should be made as soon as possible. (Signed) Geo.

The following Cape Corps deserters were in the rebellion : \u2014 Jan Cornelis, killed at Whittlesea ; Jantje Jager, killed at Fort Peddie; Frederick Windvogel, killed at Murray's Krantz ; Piet Stoffels, also killed there ; Jan September, killed at Fish River ; Bastian Jonkers, killed at Theopolis ; Kleinveldt Ruiters and Jacob Mentor, also Cape Corps deserters, are across the Kei, living near Moni's Kraal, a petty chief of Kreili's; there are also a good many Cape Corps deserters with Hans Brander ; Klaas Platjes and his son Jan Platjes are living at Kreili's own kraal ; there are several Hottentots living in Kreili's country, in parties of two and three ; many have crossed the Bashee, but I have heard that the greatest number are still with Hans Brander, in the Upper Zuurberg. Most of the Cape Corps deserters have been shot, \u2014 there are very few now living. Jan Bannies is living"], [278, "THE HON.

His Excellency cannot express in too strong terms his high admiration of the gallant and patriotic conduct of the Albany police under their Commandant, Captain Walter Currie, who, ever since he has assumed his honourable and arduous command, has evinced a gallantry and perseverance beyond all praise. Much as His Excellency regrets the loss of Lieutenant Ferreira and three other brave men who fell on this occasion, it must be a consolation to their friends that, by their noble example, and the severe chastisement they have inflicted on this lawless and desperate banditti, who thought to establish themselves as a marauding band within the colony, that such an attempt is no longer practicable ; and he confidently hopes that this will prove the last and expiring struggle of the rebellion.

King William's Town, February 12, 1853. Whereas his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief and High Commissioner of British Kaffraria is desirous \u2014 now that the rebel lious Gaika tribe has been expelled from the Amatolas and other lands formerly occupied by them, but now forfeited to the Crown \u2014 that certain townships or villages in the close vicinity of sufficient military posts and garrisons, to provide for their security, should be established without delay : And whereas numerous applications for land have been made by deserving persons who have fought nobly in the ranks of colonial levies and other corps, during the rebellion now happily suppressed, his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief and High Commissioner is pleased to order as follows : \u2014 1. That, commencing with the Keiskamma Hoek \u2014 where there is a permanent barrack and fort, and where there is abundance of good land and water, as well as of open land for pasture, with capability of irrigation, there shall be traced and defined a certain surrounding space of not more than one mile radius, in the first instance, but to"], [284, "252 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S be enlarged hereafter if found expedient, within which space, build ing and garden lots or erven shall be laid out. These building lots will not exceed a quarter of an acre each, as the first object is to form as compact a town as possible ; but allotment gardens will be laid out, as far as practicable, having a frontage to the river and outside of the space reserved for the town ; and these will contain a space of one acre, or half an acre, each, as may be desired, which will be let for one or three years on lease, on easy terms, to holders of erven in the town who desire to cultivate them. In like manner larger spaces for cultivation will also be let to persons who may wish to cultivate on a more extensive scale ; but in every case, gardeners will be required to inclose their gardens with a sufficient fence ; \u2014 the wood and stone in the close neighbourhood will furnish abundant materials. 2. That all persons desiring to become possessed of such erven may send in their applications in writing, backed by the certificate of the officers under whom they have served, if military, or by a magistrate, if not military, addressed to the Resident Magistrate at King William's Town. 3. That a Board shall be forthwith formed, consisting of the Resi dent Magistrate, an officer of the Royal Engineers, and one other member whom the Chief Commissioner may think fit to appoint, to consider the said applications, and make the allotment accordingly. 4. These grants shall, in the first instance, be provisional, and be held on the same tenure as those granted at King William's Town, but to be convertible into freehold or nominal quit-rent, as herein after provided, on the final settlement of the district. And should the Crown see fit to abandon the project of the proposed settlement in the Amatolas, the holders of such grant shall receive an equiva lent in land elsewhere, or compensation in money, at the option of the Government, for their field or garden crops. 5. The said erven, so granted, shall not be alienable until they shall have been two years in occupation. Each erf so granted must be occupied, and some sort of dwelling built in such position as shall be directed, and inhabited bond fide within six months after the notification of the grant to the applicant ; otherwise that grant will be cancelled, and the erf transferred to another. And an' erf once occupied and a dwelling constructed, should it be abandoned and left unoccupied for six months, it will in like manner be for feited ; but it will be lawful to let or lend it, so that bond fide occupation be ensured. 6. The owners of erven will have free commonage for pasture"], [285, "253 CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. within such limits of the forest of the Amatolas as the officer com manding the post may consider safe ; and certain kraals, either com mon or private, will be constructed at such places as may be selected by an appointed officer of Royal Engineers, and all cattle must be duly brought into kraal at the appointed hours. 7. The free use of all firewood, and all such timber as may be required for building or for constructing fences, will be granted ; but no timber will be cut down and carried away for purposes of trade out of the said forest, without licence granted by the Chief Commis sioner, on such terms as may be hereafter appointed. 8. Every male inhabitant above the age of sixteen will be re quired to provide himself with a gun, and be prepared to assist in defence of his own property and that of the community, in case of need. 9. The Crown retains right of resumption of auy allotment for public purposes, compensating the holder or occupier. 10. No higher rate of quit-rent than 5s. per annum for each erf shall be affixed on a town allotment, granted within the first limits now appointed. 11. Tools and agricultural implements and garden seeds will be given gratis to each holder of a building lot, on occupation. 12. Rations will be given to the occupiers of erven in this new township, for themselves and wives and children, for the first six months, from the date of their occupation.

A yearly quit-rent of 10s. will be required from the owner of each separate dwelling."], [287, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 255 They will be located in villages, which are to consist of not less than twenty dwellings. Certain garden grounds will be allotted by the Superintendent to each village. Free pasturage will be allowed, provided the whole amount of cattle belonging to each village does not exceed ten head per house or hut in the said village. No lone dwellings or unauthorised squatters will be allowed, and no herds of cattle will be permitted to graze which do not belong to some fixed community of the above description. There must be a headman for each village. He must, if possible, be the man chosen by the community. He will be answerable for all spoor of stolen property passing near to his village. No new village or location will be made, or old one removed to another place, without the knowledge and special sanction of the Chief Commissioner. Loyal Kafirs may be allowed to benefit by these arrangements at any recognised mission station. In that case, the missionary will be held responsible for the strict conformity to this rule. The Superintendent must speak the native languages. His salary will be \u00a3200 per annum, with rations of forage for two horses.

It is the theme of constant con versation among all the tribes, and has produced a thrill of joyous excitement from one end of the territory to the other. The Gaikas,"], [288, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 256 especially, regard this auspicious change in their circumstances with the most pleasurable sensations, pleasingly illustrative of their undisguised satisfaction in being restored to the favour of Her Majesty's Government. The Chief Kreili himself, in concert with his people, is most anxious for the return of missionaries and traders into his country, and also of the late resident, Mr. Fynn. This sufficiently indicates his anxious desire to revive his inter course with Europeans, and fully manifests (whatever his past conduct may have been) that, having now humbly submitted, he seeks for the return of Europeans, as a test of his sincerity and de termination to foster and maintain friendly relationship with Her Majesty's Government. At this time there are but few Hottentots left in his country, and those that are there, are in a state of the greatest destitution, and now sincerely feel the effects of their rebellious conduct. The greatest tranquillity prevails throughout the entire territory, from the river Kei to the frontier of Natal ; and all the tribes avow, without any reservation, their high satisfaction at the restoration of peace. This is particularly the case with the friendly tribes, who have never wavered in their fidelity during the whole war, although repeatedly urged to join the hostile party. They now rejoice in their constancy, and are fully convinced, notwithstanding the numerical superiority of the belligerent tribes, that they have been unable to contend successfully against Her Majesty's Government ; but, on the contrary, have been entirely overcome, and forced into humble submission. I trust this view of the case will exercise a powerful influence in confirming them in their heretofore faithful conduct, and thus tend to cement them in a permanent and advan tageous union with Her Majesty's Government. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (Signed) M. B. Shaw, British Resident Trans-Keian Tribes. W. F.

The boers and troops entered his country eight times, and each commando took a great many cattle. Kreili wishes for peace ; and he now sends 90 head of cattle, and hopes that the Government will consider it sufficient, as the troops have taken so many thou sands from him. Kreili says he never commenced a war with the Government ; the Gaikas have always got him into trouble, and he has been punished for their sins. I have been also desired by Kreili to ask Fynn to return to Butterworth, also the missionary and traders, aud he will protect them. He never told them to leave his country ; on the contrary, when they went away he was exerting himself to recover the pro perty taken from the traders.

His Excellency takes this occasion of offering his sincere congra tulations to all Her Majesty's loyal subjects, who cannot fail to be deeply interested in this happy event. On the 9th instant, His Excellency met the chiefs lately in rebellion, at the Yellow Woods, seven miles from King William's Town, and having caused the Proclamation of the 2nd instant \u2014 granting pardon to the Gaika Chief Sandilli aud his associates \u2014 to be interpreted to them by Mr. Brownlee, the Gaika Commissioner, the following Address was read to these people by Mr. Ayliff, inter preter to the High Commissioner : \u2014 \u25a0 Chiefs, \u2014 I am glad that I am now able to meet you as friends, and as good subjects of our good and great Queen. Chiefs, \u2014 I look to you for the good conduct of your people. I have seen how truly your people have adhered to you, their chiefs, and how you can make them happy or miserable, by leading them right or wrong, as you choose. Let me see that you, Sandilli, and you, Macomo, as well as the other Gaika chiefs, are as good and as true to the Queen, our great Chief, as your people have been to you. The Chiefs Pato, Siwani, Umhala, Kama, and Toise, with others, wisely refused to join you in the rebellion; they listened to the words of Maclean, and remained unmolested, enjoying the pleasures of peace. Maclean is now in the place of Mackinnon, and he, as my mouth, will live among you, and govern you, under me, in the Queen's name. Whilst it is war between us I cannot talk with the enemies of the Queen, until they are subdued, and beg for peace, and are for given. Now that you are forgiven, and it is peace with you, Sandilli, my ears will be open to hear your word ; and I have placed Brownlee here, to listen to your wishes regarding the welfare of your people, and he will carry them to Maclean and me. He will give you good advice, which, if you listen to, you and your people will escape much trouble.

His Excellency then informed the Chiefs that if they wished to speak he was now willing to hear them. The following is a minute of the Conversation : \u2014 Govebnor, \u2014 I am glad to see you as friends, and in peace, and hope that the peace now ratified will prove a lasting one. I am now called from this by business, but will return shortly, when I shall hope to find you all settled. If you have anything to say I am ready to hear. Macomo. \u2014 We have but one word to say and to thank. We thank the Governor for taking us out of the Bush, and for giving us a place to live in. When a child errs, he is punished and for given ; this young man (Sandilli) erred, has been punished, and is now forgiven, but the country you have given him is too small. Toise, who formerly occupied it, had but a small tribe. Sandilli has a large one, which will not find room there. Governor. \u2014 These are things you should have thought of before you went to war. I know that Toise has but a small tribe, and that it never half filled the country allotted to him. Macomo. \u2014 We look to you to speak for us, and to represent our case to the Queen. We are her subjects. When settled in the country allotted to us, Kreili, Umhala, and Toise will affect to be satisfied, but will regard us as intruders, and this will cause con stant heart-burnings between us. Governor. \u2014 I will send your words to the Queen ; but I will give you no hopes of ever again occupying the Amatolas, as when you were there you were constantly plotting mischief, and cannot be trusted there again.

My Lord Duke, \u2014 As I hope to arrive in England by the same packet which conveys this mail, it is not necessary I should trouble your Grace with any long despatches on any of the numerous separate subjects which it is my duty to forward, as I hope to be at hand to afford any explanations which may be required ; and as far as regards them, I shall, as far as pos sible, confine myself to mere letters of transmission. In this, I purpose laying before your Grace a general view of the state of things in the colony at this time, when I am about to place the Government in other hands, in accordance with your Grace's sanction to do so, when I could leave all things safe. I am happy to say I now leave this colony in a state of per fect repose and security, and with every prospect of a permanent peace and increasing prosperity. 1. To show that this is not only my own conviction, but is also the opinion of the community at large, I inclose some of the numerous addresses which have poured in upon me, on the eve of my departure, from all quarters. Those from the frontier districts of Queenstown, the Kat River, King William's Town, and Graham's Town, the last of which bears 500 signatures, are particularly satisfactory ; for they are signed by persons most cognisant and most interested in the subjects to which they refer. 2. As regards the coming into operation of the Constitution Ordinances, the election for members of the House of Assembly, as far as the returns have been received, which embraces the greater portion, have been conducted with perfect propriety in every instance. The result gives promise of as fair a repre sentation of the interests of all classes and races of Her Ma jesty's subjects in this colony, by respectable members, as could have been expected or desired."], [302, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 270 The dilatory progress of this business, which the observance of the requirements of the Ordinances is said to have rendered unavoidable, threatened to run the last election process so near the termination of the period at which, by the 00th section of the Ordinance, it was enjoined, that Parbament should be sum moned to meet, that I, some time since, gave out a Government notice, to remind all concerned that Parbament must be sum moned to meet before the end of next month ; but as some of the returns have not yet been sent in, and many members have to come up to the seat of Government from very great dis tances, by the slow conveyance of bullock-waggons, over very bad roads \u2014 in some cases implying a month's journey \u2014 I con sulted the Executive Council this day on the subject, having the advice of the Attorney-General in his place in Council, as to what measures could and ought to be taken to give effect to Clause 60, in which the meeting of Parliament must take place on or before the last day of next month. I inclose an extract of the Proceedings of Council, in which I am advised to issue a provisional notice, summoning the Legislative Council and House of Assembly to meet on Friday, 30th June next, at such place in Cape Town as may hereafter be named, and which will be named in the Proclamation of Summons, as soon as the terms of the Ordinance shall render it lawful to promulgate the same, in due form. I have reason to know that my former provisional notice has bad its effect, and that members from remote districts intended to commence their journey about this time ; so that, and with this additional more decided notice, which will appear in to-morrow's Gazette, there is no doubt that the six weeks which remain will suffice to ensure a full meeting at the opening of this first Parliament, which is very desirable. 3. I took advantage of the some Council pro forma, and to guard against any possible misunderstanding, to read to that board my letter to your Grace, No. 23, 15th April, 1854, and to put the question, \" On whom, according to law, must the"], [303, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 271 administration of the government of this colony devolve when I take my departure ?\" Having examined my commission, and that of Lieutenant-Governor Darbng, as well as Lieutenant- General Jackson's letter and inclosures, it was the unanimous opinion that the administration of the government can only law fully devolve upon Lieutenant-Governor Darling, according to existing commissions and royal instructions. 4. Concerning the affairs of the Orange River Free State, it belongs to the Special Commissioner* to report, and he has, no doubt, done so by this post ; but I inclose an official letter I have received from the present Provisional President, and my answer; as it is the first official correspondence which has passed between the new neighbouring independent state and the Governor of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope. 5. With regard to British Kaffraria, I have been fortunate enough to meet Sir George Clerk here, who came down from the frontier with that object. I have derived, at all times, great benefit from the friendly and unreserved intercourse by letter which has been invariably kept up between us, since his first arrival ; but this opportunity of personal conference has enabled me to transfer to him all documents and information which I possess respecting British Kaffraria ; and it is his in tention to leave this for the frontier on the 1st June, and, after staying a few days at Graaf-Reinet, where his office as Special Commissioner for winding up the Orange River affairs is now at work, then to proceed, in the capacity of Acting High Commissioner, to King WiUiam's Town, to prepare all things for giving effect to the Letters Patent, constituting that pro vince a Lieutenant- Government, which he will do as soon as he shall receive his commission as Governor of the Cape, or that some other Governor shall be permanently appointed. I inclose a copy of a memorandum which I have drawn up for his assistance ; in which I acquaint him with all the details of measures which I had intended to have adopted with this * Sir G. Clerk, K.C.B."], [304, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 272 view, had the task devolved upon me ; but without wishing thereby in any way to influence his better judgment when he shall have become better acquainted with all the circumstances of the case, by personal observations on the spot. Your Grace will observe that these suggestions differ only slightly in certain matters of detail from the scheme I sub mitted in my letter of the 11th February, 1853, to Sir John Pakington, when I first became aware of the existence of the former Letters Patent. 6. It becomes necessary to consider the effect of Sir George Clerk's absence on the frontier for the performance of this duty, with respect to the possible arrival of bis commission whilst still on the frontier. I think, with him, this duty is of para- mount and immediate importance ; for it is desirable that the relative positions of the civil and military authorities on the frontier and in Kaffraria should be clearly defined and per- manently estabbsbed, although I have every reason to think they are perfectly understood, and that every possible dispo- sition to cordial and friendly co-operation now exists on both sides. But he cannot well accomplish it, and be back at Cape Town before the middle of August, as he must travel probably not less than 2000 miles, at the average rate, if he use the ut- most expedition, and meet with no delay, of 100 miles in three days ; so that be cannot be less than sixty days on the road. Should his commission as Governor arrive by the packet due in the end of July, and that the Colonial Parliament, which must have been assembled by Lieutenant-Governor Darling, be then sitting, he cannot act or displace Mr. Darling till he come to Cape Town, to be sworn in by the Chief Justice ; but Mr. Darling has declared his intention of communicating with and consulting Sir George Clerk, as in duty bound, on every sub ject connected with the Government, and, especially, all Parlia- mentary measures of importance, the future development of which is likely so soon to pass under Sir George Clerk's responsibility."], [305, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 273 7.

Success has already attended these measures beyond my most sanguine expectations, which I mainly attribute to the able and zealous manner in which they have been carried out by the Deputy Surveyor-General, Mr. Robinson, and the other gentlemen who formed unpaid boards and commissions ap pointed by me to carry out details, subject to my personal supervision.* 8.

These medals have been executed in the most satisfactory man ner, and I have reason to think their distribution, which is now taking place, will have the happiest effect, and give great grati fication to this well-disposed and valuable contingent, on whose fidelity and present allocation I rely much, as one essential ingredient in the general arrangements for the defence and security of the frontier.

The lively interest you have taken in the welfare of our com munity demands from us the warmest expression of our thanks. You return to England to discharge duties of a higher cha racter than the government of a colony. We sincerely hope that you may be given strength and health to fulfil all your country requires of you ; and we pray that you will express our unabated attachment to Her most gracious Majesty the Queen.

SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S sense of the eminent services you have rendered to the inhabi tants of this frontier. They are deeply impressed by the fact, that, when your Excellency arrived in this province, their prospects were most disheartening ; the Kafir tribes beyond the border were unsub dued ; sedition still lurked within the colony ; and life and property were held on as precarious a tenure as at any period of the war. Amid these elements of confusion, your Excellency assumed the administration of affairs, and by a rare union of temper, dis cretion, and ability, the chaos was speedily reduced to order, the frontier districts were protected, the enemy punished and driven back, public confidence was restored, and measures were adopted to secure tranquillity, aud promote the substantial prosperity and advancement of the country. The inhabitants of this city would not do justice to them selves, nor to your Excellency, were they not to advert, in terms of unqualified approval to the measure adopted by your Excellency, of filling up the country on the immediate Kafir border with hardy experienced frontier inhabitants, men habi tuated to danger, practised in the use of fire-arms, and ac quainted with the habits of the natives. With a frontier so occupied and defended, supported by an adequate mibtary force, as recommended by your Excellency, in your despatch of the 11th February, 1853, they cannot hesi tate to believe that the very best chance of future safety is afforded, provided your Excellency's system is so fostered and supported by Her Majesty's Government, as to give firmness and stability to the whole structure. The inhabitants of this city desire to express their conviction of the great advantage derived from your Excellency's constant presence on this frontier from the period when your Excellency assumed the Government of the colony, two years since. The continued presence of, and the judicious measures adopted by, your Excellency, have effectually tested the perti-"], [311, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 279 nency of the recommendation (so unfortunately disregarded) of the Royal Commission of 1823, in which local Government for this province, and the constant presence of an officer armed with ample powers, are insisted on ; and, at the same time, the expediency shown of applying \" some uniform and consistent principles to the intercourse of the colonists with the Kafir and other tribes ; of preventing their collision, and of checking the desultory warfare that has prevailed along a considerable part of the frontier.

Sir, \u2014 The letters patent, dated 7th March, 1 854, constitu ting British Kaffraria a Lieutenant Government, having only reached me at this place by last mail on the 5th instant, and my departure from the colony being fixed for the next oppor tunity, which may be expected in a week hence, it would be impossible for me to take any measures for the practical and preliminary arrangements, which must be made prior to their promulgation. I therefore confide this legal instrument, toge ther with the Royal instructions in the tin box, as I received them, to your trust, as the only member of the Commission for frontier affairs beyond the colonial boundary who will be remaining in South Africa when I take my departure ; and I have caused a Government notice to be published to the effect that tbe duties and responsibilities of High Commissioner will then devolve on your sole administration. I have every reason to hope and expect that the Royal Commission, appointing you my successor in the civil government of the Cape of Good Hope, will arrive in two months' time from this date ; but it may so happen that some other Governor may in the interim have been permanently commissioned. This I do not think likely, and am quite sure that, should it occur, as it only could from the accident of letters crossing on tbe road, it would be an accidental occurrence, as much regretted by Her Majesty's Government at home as it would be by myself, who, though about to be relieved from the duties and responsibility, cannot for the future divest myself from a sincere interest in the welfare and prosperity of all parts of Her Majesty's South African dominion. My object in this letter, which I place in the tin box with the letters patent, &c, is to put before you in detail tbe arrangements by which I had intended to give effect to the said u"], [322, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 290 letters patent, which I expected to receive in time to act upon them during my administration. In offering these notes to your consideration, I merely give them as my own views, founded on my own experience, and as suggestions which, except in so far as they may accord with your own views, and stand tbe test of your own better judg ment, I do not wish or expect to have any influence. I have not pledged Her Majesty's Government in any way to the adoption of any one of the proposed arrangements, and I have received no specific instructions on the subject; but the terms of the letters patent and instructions are sufficient war rants, and afford a sufficient guide for the adoption of these measures, or some other more appropriate and efficacious, some such preliminary arrangements beiDg indispensable, in order to carry out tbe intentions of Her Majesty's Govern ment. A copy of my despatch to Secretary Sir John Pakington, dated 11th February, 1853, No. 51, I enclose, in which I ex pressed my opinion that it was desirable this measure should be carried into effect for certain reasons therein stated. The principal object I had in view is, in fact, to place tbe adminis tration of the civil government in tbe province of Kaffraria in a position known to the law, and recognised and provided for in colonial as well as military rules and regulations, as under a Lieutenant-Governor, with deputed powers from tbe Governor of the Cape colony, but unconnected with tbe Cape Parliament, whereas the cognomen, Chief Commissioner, is an unknown designation, and the provisional arrangements, which have served the purposes of legislation and administration well enough, ad interim, are, until letters patent and instructions under the Royal sign manual be promulgated and enforced, manifestly anomalous and irregular, aud not according to law. The despatch already adverted to will explain the pre sent position of the Chief Commissioner, and the circum-"], [323, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 291 stance which led to his appointment. Another despatch, 20th of September, 1852, No. 23, notifying the appoint ment of Captain Maclean as Chief Commissioner, in conse quence of the resignation of Colonel M'Kinnon, will fur fher explain the position of the present Chief Commissioner. [But here I will call your attention, by way of parenthesis, to one circumstance, which might lead to misconception, and which, indeed, has not escaped tbe observation of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury. This case, inci dental to our subject, and which I here introduce, is, that in my despatch of 20th of September, 1852, I pointed out the financial arrangement, by which I hoped to supply the place of Colonel M'Kinnon, who was in the receipt of military pay, without noticing the abatement of that mibtary pay, so as to provide for the civil service, without increase of civil expendi ture, although I substituted a civil administrator for a com bined military and civil one. In this I took credit for the abatement of the Gaika Commissioner and bis salary of \u00a3400 per annum. Subsequeut events and the policy which, on ma ture consideration and improved experience, appeared to me tbe only one to be adopted, viz. that the Gaikas, although dispossessed of their lauds, bad not been and could not be \" eaten up,\" and that some 30,000 vagrant souls expelled from their homes, if we desired peace, must be settled in some recog nised location, and reduced to organisation and control, con vinced me of tbe necessity of filling up a vacant tract of country, remote from the colouial border, with these people, with their own forfeited Gaika territory and fastnesses inter vening, in the hope of fixing them in it, and preventing the perpetual struggle of 30,000 exiles, between starvation and a desire to be allowed to remain in peace, if only allowed the enjoyment of the necessaries of life somewhere. This led to tbe formation of the present new Gaika location and concentration of that clan, under the responsible rule of their legitimate chief. Having thus found it not only indispen- u 2"], [324, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 292 sable, but the best policy, to establish a new Gaika location, though in a very different locality, and having peremptorily refused all prayers to be allowed to return to their forfeited location, and discouraged all such hopes, the services of a Gaika Commissioner to watch them, and communicate with them constantly, I found to be absolutely necessary; there fore, I re-appointed Mr. Brownlee Gaika Commissioner. I in troduce this now in parenthesis, because it may be inquired into and require further explanation, for I am not sure that it may not have escaped me to notify the removal of the old voted appointment in due form.] Now, to return to the esta blishment of British Kaffraria : 1st, we have the Chief Com missioner; 2nd, next on tbe list we have a Resident Magi strate ; 3rd, we have an Interpreter to the High Commissioner, who also did duty as secretary on many occasions which re quired bis services, especially beyond the border, as in the expedition beyond the Kei and into the Orange River territory, on which occasion he accompanied me in the field. These are, in fact, the only existing appointments which I need notice in this paper as ex officio materials, as the other minor appointments will remain in all respects unchanged by any alteration in the form of Government, as will the Gaika Commissioner, who is an essential agent in his locality, but cannot, I think, take part in tbe legislative or administrative government, without neglecting his other important duties at present; he should, however, he a magistrate, with powers under the Act of King William IV. The three with whom we have, then, now to do are \u2014 1st, Chief Commissioner ; 2nd, Resi dent Magistrate ; 3rd, Interpreter. As connected with my pro posed new arrangement for providing an Executive Council, the arrangement I propose to meet this new requirement, under the Letters Patent, is \u2014 1st, The Chief Commissioner shall change his name to Lieutenant-Governor, with deputed powers from tbe Governor at tbe Cape, but without any material increase of salary."], [325, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 293 2nd, The Resident Magistrate shall remain in statu quo, without any alteration of salary or functions. 3rd, A Treasurer will be required : to supply this I propose that, with the sanction of the Lords of Her Majesty's Treasury, the principal commissariat officer at King William's Town shall be treasurer, having a Kaffrarian allowance of \u00a3100 per annum for his trouble. The sanction for this may with safety be provisionally anticipated. 4th, To complete the financial establishment and disconnect the financial affairs of this separate province from the parlia mentary control of tbe Cape Parliament, an Auditor will be re quired : there is no man more fit for it, or more deserving of the permanent appointment, than the present interpreter. If his present pay, guaranteed as a permanent salary for the new appointment of auditor, \" de bene gerente,\" it will suffice ; and his present appointment as a separate one, is no longer neces sary; but it must be intimated to him that his services and talents would be called for if required by the High Commis sioner to interpret, when necessary; this, however, in the pre sent instance would be unnecessary, as Mr. Ayliff speaks the language as fluently and correctly as a native, has pleasure in being the medium of communication in an interview, and is, on all occasions, a most zealous and obliging public servant. These three public functionaries will suffice for the administra tive business; but, to complete the executive council, I would advise the continuance as non-official members, but by special appointment, of tbe two members in addition, who are now placed by me provisionally, acting with great zeal and ability, on what I have called the Kaffrarian Board, being, in fact, a provisional executive council, in the present provisional go vernment. These are the chief officer of engineers in Kaf fraria, who, from his scientific education and practical expe rience, cannot fail to be a most useful ingredient in such a council. Should he be removed by circumstances of his mib-"], [326, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 294 tary service, bis successor, as chief of engineers in Kaffraria, would be appointed in his place. 5th, I have added, as a non-official member, Lieut. -Colonel Bisset, an officer of great experience in the colony, and one of great ability, and who takes great interest in the affairs of Kaffraria and the eastern districts of the colony. There is no civilian at present in British Kaffraria, who, from education and character, or condition in society, I could recommend to be placed on this Board ; but I am not prepared to say, that no one else can be henceforward found competent, or that circumstances should render it expedient that any exclusive rule as regards civilians should be established. The above named five officers I recommend should change their name from \" Kaffrarian Board\" to Executive Council, with due war rant from you, under the Great Seal of Kaffraria, which instru ment is already in charge of Colonel Maclean, and ready for use. Then, I think, this important preliminary may thus be sufficiently provided for without much trouble, or increased expense, or interruption of business. Legal Advice. I do not think that, considering the very limited extent of non-military population of European origin, in British Kaf fraria, who do not amount to more than 12,000 souls, I mean those who are not actual dependants, and followers of the army; and, on the other hand, the vast majority of native population, amounting to probably about 70,000 souls, who, as yet, can only be governed with prudence and safety, accord ing to the principles admirably laid down and explained in the last section of tbe Royal Instructions, and which must for the present be seen to by tbe sub -commissioners, specially ap pointed to watch over the several tribes, under the chief con trol of the Lieutenant-Governor ; considering also that the Mutiny Act provides for the bond fide followers of the army,"], [327, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 295 anything more is not at present required than the Resident Magistrate's court, with appeal to tbe Lieutenant-Governor ; but in case of intercolonial questions, or other cases which may require legal advice, I think the advice of the Solicitor-Gene ral, now appointed to reside chiefly at Graham's Town, might be at all times available, and would be most willingly given. This, indeed, I have ascertained in the most satisfactory man ner; but it would be just and right that some retaining fee, by way of Kaffrarian allowance, should be given to tbe Soli citor-General for this increased and extra colonial trouble and responsibility of bis management of such grave cases as may refuse to be removed into a colonial court by virtue of the Act 0 and 7 William IV. chap. lvii. State of the Law and Framing Ordinance. The existing primitive state of what may be considered the civil law in British Kaffraria is as follows : \u2014 Under tbe authority of the High Commissioner, who also, is, as Commander-in-Chief, in the full exercise of martial law in a conquered country, and under full military occupation, certain regulations have provisionally, from time to time, as occasions required, been ordered and promulgated in the shape of general orders, proclamations, and regulations, regulating traders, licences, inn-keepers, and spirit dealers' beences, &c, &c, and imposing fines and penalties for tbe infringement of such regulations ; also certain police regulations suitable to, and required by, tbe existing state of society in Kaffraria, the enforcement of all which, in tbe ordinary course of things, has been confided to the judgment and administration of a resi dent civil magistrate, at King William's Town, with appeal to the Chief Commissioner, who indeed also personally acts as magistrate, in co-operation with the Resident Magistrate. Although martial law is still paramount in case of need, in British Kaffraria, it is perfectly understood that it is more con venient and more analogous to British institutions, that the"], [328, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 296 said martial law, or extraordinary assumption of power, should remain in abeyance, except when called for by any emergency, and that such cases, in which civibans are implicated, and which are not provided for in the Mutiny Act, should be dis posed of as in a police court by the civil power; military offenders implicated in civil transgressions being given over to their regiment. In cases of a more grave and serious character, in which civilians are implicated, and yet not such as may call for the prompt and paramount extra-judicial interference of martial law, the Kaffrarian magistrates have the power of avaibng themselves of the Act 6 and 7 of King William IV. chap, lvii., to remove the case into a colonial court of the Cape of Good Hope. Now, to put the new constitution, as enacted by Royal let ters patent, in force, according to their spirit and meaning, without deranging the present system, which is found to work so well, and is now understood, it was my intention, had the task fallen to me, after making the prebminary arrangements in respect to the Executive Council, provisionally and pending Her Majesty's pleasure, to pass forthwith a primary ordinance. No. 1 , which might run thus : \" Whereas, by Letters Patent, &c, the portion of territory therein defined, now in military occupation, has been declared a Crown possession, to be go verned by, &c. ; and whereas henceforth, all laws for its go vernment are to be enacted, under the form of ordinances as therein defined and commanded ; and whereas sundry laws, regulations, and general orders, have from time to time been provisionally promulgated, under the authority of the Com mander-in-Chief and High Commissioner, and are now known and held to be at this time laws duly in force. Now, there fore, it is hereby enacted, that the provisions of all general orders, proclamations, and regulations which have been duly promulgated and are now in force, shall continue to be in force, and to be acted upon and have the force of law under"], [329, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 297 the authority of this ordinance, until all or any of them shall hereafter be amended or annulled by subsequent ordinances, to be duly passed under the Great Seal of the province, as re quired and enjoined by the Royal Letters Patent and Royal Instructions.\" I give this merely as a sketch of my own pro ject, but have not had the advice of the law-officers upon it ; I would then have proceeded without delay to reconsider the whole existing code, which does not comprise numerous or compbcated provisions ; amend and class them, perhaps, under separate heads, if necessary, and, after due consultation with the Sobcitor-General, cause the requisite ordinance or ordi nances, as the case may require, for consobdation or simplifi cation and amendment, to be passed in due form, so as to make the sufficient fundamental code for the government of this infant and diminutive province. In all matters not pro vided for by provincial ordinance, or imperial statute, I would advise that the rule of practice in tbe magistrate's court should continue to be in conformity with that in the colonial magi strate's courts, as it is at present understood to be. Finance. With reference to this head I enclose a copy of my despatch, dated the 15th of December, 1853, to the Secretary of State; also, a very clear and accurate statement drawn up by my pri vate secretary * from authentic returns and documents in my possession, which I have carefully examined and verified, and the correctness of which I can vouch for. In one item, on tbe credit side, you will observe that the amount of probable revenue from customs' dues is placed at \u00a35000 per annum. At the time this memorandum was framed, we bad, as there stated, assumed the amount on the estimate of the Chief Commissioner of Kaffraria, that the value of goods which had paid duty in the colony, and thereby benefiting the W. F. Liddle, Esq."], [330, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 298 colonial revenue, but which found their way coastwise, via East London, into Kaffraria, was upwads of \u00a3100,000. Since then I have been able to obtain more satisfactory data to verify this fact, by requiring from the collector of customs a monthly statement or estimate. That for the last month is herewith euclosed, by which it will appear that the amount by which the, colony has benefited in that period is \u00a3371 5s. lid. This is exclusive of any receipts at tbe port of East London, which is at present held to belong to the colony of the Cape. Thus, assuming that the average monthly amount may be \u00a3400, the yearly revenue so at present derived by the Cape would be \u00a34800 ; only \u00a3200 short of the rough estimate arrived at from other data by Mr. Liddle's previous calcu lation. These facts, which you will have full opportunity of verify ing when you visit King William's Town, are of importance. For when Kaffraria finances come to be separated from those of the colony, among which they are at present inconveniently, and, I think, unnecessarily jumbled, and that when a seeming subsidy or extent in aid is called for, under tbe aborigines' provision to complete the Kaffrarian ways and means, to meet the expenditure, Kafir policemen included, the colony, holding the port of East London, will in fact be the gainer by its con nection with British Kaffraria, to the amount of about \u00a31000 per annum. But tbe colony is in duty bound not only to appropriate this balance, but much more, if required, for the improvement and civilisation of the aborigines, so as to render them gradually amenable to civilised laws, capable of works of industry, and possessors of property, which will render it their interest to remain at peace. With these remarks I resign tbe important trust to which they refer into your able management, assuring you, that in matters of this nature, necessarily requiring a bold assumption of discretionary power, and incapable of being provided for by rigid instructions from home, which might cramp and embarrass"], [331, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 299 their efficient and prompt development, I have always acted in the full confidence of receiving the indulgent support of Her Majesty's Government, and their approval of my zealous but bumble endeavours to carry out their views, and I have never been disappointed. Wishing you every success iu this business, which, though not unimportant, is child's play, com pared to the arduous and complicated task which you have so ably and successfully accomplished, I remain, Very faithfully and sincerely yours, (Signed) George Cathcart. Memorandum. Taking the latest Returns, being for a period of ten months, from the 1st January to 31st October, 1853, it will be seen that the Expenditure was \u00a35060 19s. 8d., being only \u00a31044 10s. id. (about one-fifth part) iu excess of the Revenue, which amounted to \u00a34016 9s. id. ; and this latter sum is exclusive of the revenue derived from the amount of Customs' Duties now originally levied, in part of the Cape Colony, upon goods transmitted coastwise to the Port of East London. The Chief Commissioner estimates that upwards of \u00a3100,000 worth of merchandise is passed into British Kaffraria annually. This, at 5 per cent., would give an addition of \u00a35000 to the revenue of Kaffraria. The duty on foreign manufactures is 12 per cent... so that the revenue from the customs may be estimated at rather above than under \u00a35000. In the expenditure of British Kaffraria is included the subsidy of \u00a375 per annum, to the Amapanda Chief Faku, the salary to the British Resident Trans-Keian tribes of \u00a3250, and pay to native messengers, amounting in all to about \u00a3400 per annum. It is a question whether or not these items should be chargeable to the Cape Colony or Natal instead of British Kaffraria. On the other side, there will be a charge against the revenue of British Kaffraria for the sum of \u00a31748 7s. 1 Id., the estimated cost of the Kafir Police."], [332, "THE HON.

Graham's Town, February 11, 1854."], [333, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 301 Memorandum by Deputy Surveyor General Robinson. Previous to His Excellency Sir George Cathcart leaving this colony, I am anxious to lay before him a general statement of the progress of the system pursued by his orders for the pro tection of tbe frontier, accompanied by such sketches as I have been -enabled to prepare illustrative of that system. Queen's Town. Commencing on the northern and north-eastern border, formed by the division of Queen's Town, the system of defen sive occupation has been energetically, and, it is hoped, effi ciently pursued. The whole of this border is now densely populated, and the capital, Queen's Town, founded in its centre, has been firmly established, aided, as it has been, in being selected by tbe congregation of the Dutch Reformed Church as the site for the residence of their clergyman and establishment of their church. 2. The middle portion* of this division has also been occu pied, but more densely, owing to the fertile character of the country, by a hardy race of border farmers. 3. The village Whittlesea has been remodelled on tbe system pursued at Queen's Town, and has been strengthened; and another small village, \"Tylden,\" has been estabbsbed at an important rallying point, known as Trader's Drift, on the Zwart Kei. 4. Within the colonial boundary, proclaimed in 1848, but on lands entirely in their possession, the Tambookie Regent Nonesi, and some friendly petty chiefs, with the remnants of the tribes almost annihilated during the late war, have again taken up their residence. These people form a band between the division of Queen's Town and the country under the * Being that portion of the country occupied before the war by the Tam boukie Chief Mapassa."], [334, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 302 Zuiir Bergen, thinly occupied by the tribe of tbe great Gaika Chief Kreili. 5. Within this division native reserves have been made at Lesseyton, Kamastone, Oxkraal, and Windvogelberg. His Excellency's instructions to have these lands granted in trust to the \" Native Improvement Board,\" for subsequent subdivi sion and grant to the natives, Fingoes, and Tambookies, are receiving the attention their great importance deserves ; and I hope I shall be able to submit for signature, before His Excel lency leaves,* some document which will convey these lands, permanently, to men who have proved so faithful to tbe colo nists, and from whom so much can be obtained, if properly treated. 0. The most southern part of the Queen's Town division, bounded by the summits of the Amatola range, and, easterly, by the great road to King William's Town, being unsuitable for permanent farming purposes, remains at present unoccu pied ; though it is most probable that so soon as the upper part of the country becomes permanently settled, branches of the families living there will take possession, using tbe lands for agriculture and summer grazing, for which it is adapted ; but the severe cold in winter, and absence of wood, prevent occupation throughout the year, either by colonial farmers or natives. 7. The Queen's Town division will supply 400 farms and 1200 armed men, without including the contingent furnished by the native reserves, before referred to ; this force wiU pro bably amount to half that strength, or 600 fighting men. 8. The boundary with Kaffraria, in this division, is now formed generally by lofty and impassable mountain ridges. Exceptions to this plan, however, are found at Nonesis Basin, aud the road from Kakazeli to the Windvogelberg neck. 9. Of tbe 400 farms, 200 have been duly surveyed, and titles * The form of grant has, since this was written, been submitted for his Excellency's consideration."], [335, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 303 will be prepared as soon as I am in a position to submit them to the Land Board for the assessment of quit-rents ; and by the end of the year 1854, I am led to hope that the whole of the Queen's Town division titles will be prepared for tbe Govern ment signature, and tbe system introduced by General Cathcart will be in full operation. 10. Tbe district of Stockenstrom, late Kat River settlement, or such portions as have been declared vacant by a competent commission, have already been occupied by about 150 farmers, English and Dutch. Each farmer has an allotment of arable land, varying from 5 to 20 acres, with equal rights on sur rounding blocks of common land. These allotments and privileges are very limited for an African stock farmer ; but by placing members of the same family in one block, the advantages derivable therefrom are much increased ; and it is probable that, after the lapse of a few years, many of these grants will be permitted to merge into one, thus placing them on a similar footing to other grants. Iu the meantime, the dense population afforded by this species of occupation will tend to the security of the country, and will force such of the Hottentots as are still residing in the district to become useful and industrious members of society ; or, it will be the means of enabling them to transfer their property to those worthy of holding it, and capable of fulfilling the responsibilities attached to its possession. 11. The survey of this Settlement has been much delayed by causes not necessary to refer to here. It will, however, be com menced within a few days ; and I hope by the end of the year to have tbe diagrams and titles prepared for delivery. In tbe meantime, the occupation will proceed with regularity and dis patch, and, where it can be effected without risk of future dis putes, the location will be permitted to precede the survey. 12 The establishment of a village at Eland's Post will afford security and establish confidence ; and, from the number of"], [336, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 304 members now residing within the district, it is hoped that a Reformed Dutch Church will be erected there. 13. The country (Fullersheck, Blinkwater, &c.) occupied before the war by Hermanus and his rebel followers, has been distributed to, and is now occupied by, farmers ; and the village of Blinkwater, at the junction of that stream and the Kat River, and occupied by a mixed population of Hottentots (believed to be loyal), military settlers, and English agriculturists, is pro gressing favourably. This district will supply for its defence 600 men. 14. This paper is written simply for tbe purpose stated in the Preface ; but it is not, perhaps, altogether irregular to remark, whilst on the subject of tbe occupation of a settlement of so notorious a character, that it is generally believed \u2014 and it is an opinion to which I wholly subscribe \u2014 that, had the excellent regulations and conditions of tbe founder been carried out, the late miserable rebellion and confusion would not have occurred 15. These are now, by his Excellency's command, after a lapse of twenty-Ave years, to be enforced among the remaining Hottentots, and I hope will meet with success. The delivery of tbe titles, enabling tbe holders to dispose of their property, will, it is probable, be the means of breaking up a class settle ment which has not fulfilled the expectations of its originators. 16. In Victoria, the villages of Newcastle, Peddie, and Aberdeen have been established or remodelled. Tbe former is likely to become a place of some mercantile importance, arising from its contiguity to a port (Waterloo Bay) capable of being of much service, if proper facilities were introduced for loading and discharging cargoes. Its position, centrality, in a densely populated country, on the present system, will command trade. 17. Peddie, though not, I believe, destined to rise much in the scale of frontier villages, has been, and will be, increased in population and strength ; its chief value arising, I presume, from the military advantages it commands."], [337, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 305 18. Aberdeen promises to become an important place, the Dutch inhabitants of the surrounding country having decided to estabbsb their Church there. Some sixty erven have been taken, on condition of building and occupation. A mo derate degree of colonial intelligence tells me, that, wherever a minister of this Church is called upon to reside by a congre gation of moderate numbers, a town is certain to flourish ; and I am confident that this opening from Kaffraria will be filled up (in Aberdeen) by a barrier not easily assailable. 19. The vacant lands surrounding Aberdeen have been occu pied by a party of twelve farmers, under the guidance of a Dutch Commandant from the TJitenhage division. These lands are surveyed. The occupancy by these men has already caused property purchased on speculation, in 1848, to rise in value, and many transfers have taken place. This is of importance, as it enables the proprietors to extend their farming operations, and, at the same time, fills up country otherwise lying idle. It is also significant of the trust these men attach to the present measures. 20. Victoria. \u2014 The occupancy of tbe lower part of Victoria, that is, the country between the King William's Towu road and the sea, has not yet taken place, owing to the Fingoes not having been called upon to remove within their own boundaries until the removal of their crops. 21. It is hoped that, as their country is peculiarly adapted to the growth of Indian and Kafir corn, oats, barley, potatoes, &c, and not suited for cattle or sheep in large numbers, the inhabitants will devote themselves principally, if not entirely, to agriculture ; and thus remove a great source of temptation to their cattle-loving neighbours. 22. The vacant lands in this division will afford room for 200 farms of 1,000 to 1,400 acres each, and, with tbe villages, may furnish 500 men for its defence. 23. This is, I believe, considered to be the portion of the frontier requiring the greatest protection. The stated strength x"], [338, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 306 is, however, increased in a very great degree by the bands of Fingoes located throughout the lower line, as shown in sketches* accompanying these memoranda. 24. The Governor's intention of conveying to these people, before his departure from the colony, through the Native Im provement Board, tbe whole of then* lands for their sole use, to be transferred to individuals as early as circumstances will admit, is one of the most important features effected for the defence of this frontier ; and I shall be proud to consider my self in any way connected with this great work, which I believe to be the only practical philanthropy and real good which has been done for tbe Fingoes since their release from slavery by tbe Kafirs. It is a liberality, the advantages of which will be apparent and immediate. 25. I hope to have it in my power, ere many months are over, to commence tbe surveys of those grants for this object, or so soon as the Native Improvement Board have conveyed to me the names of tbe proposed grantees. 26. In pursuance of bis Excellency's instructions, principal Training Schools are about to be established within these loca tions, on glebe lands granted for the use of the resident mis sionaries. If instruction in simple mechanical trades, and in the cultivation of other crops than Indian and Kafir corn, were permitted to occupy a larger portion of tbe teacher's time, the state or condition of the native would be considerably advanced; mental improvement would naturally follow. 27. In conclusion, I would remark, there is one subject which, though it has not escaped his Excellency's attention in British Kaffraria, has not extended to the frontier, though of paramount importance. I allude to the formation of great trunk roads through the country lately occupied. Tbe leading thoroughfares in the most important districts of the eastern frontier, although originally made at the cost of the Imperial * Believed to be at the Colonial Office, London."], [339, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 307 Government, are now almost impassable. This is natural. It can hardly be expected that a Government or Board residing at Cape Town, however useful and efficient there, can extend its energies six or eight hundred miles from its base. In tbe usual course of events, it is weakened by so great a tax on its powers, and paralysis occurs somewhere. This appears to have taken place where its vitality was most required for tbe security of the frontier. It is hoped that so great an aid to the system to which this paper refers will not be much longer withheld by the Govern ment on the eve of formation. (Signed) M. R. Robinson, Deputy Surveyor-General. Fort Beaufort, Cape of Good Hope. April 25, 1854. To His Grace the Duke of Newcastle. Government House, Cape Town, May 19, 1854. My Lord Duke, \u2014 I have the honour to acknowledge your Grace's despatch-circular, dated 24th February, 1854, inclosing one from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, dated 22nd of the same month, in which I am enjoined, as Governor of the Cape of Good Hope, to take all such precautions or mea sures as may be calculated to afford equal protection to British and French subjects and commerce, in the event of tbe probable occurrence of actual hostilities with the Russian Empire ; and further, to guard against danger from any machinations of the enemy, who might seek to devise means of offence from coun tries whose governments take no part in the contest. In answer, I have the honour to inclose the letter dated 8th May, 1854, which I have written to kthe Lieutenant-General Commanding, by which your Grace will observe that I have provided, as far as in my power, and, I think, adequately, for x 2"], [340, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 308 the protection of this port under present circumstances. There is no other sea-port of any consequence in this colony, in which the commerce of either nation, now united in the common cause against Russia, is exposed to insult or interruption. The port of Simon's Bay is very little frequented by any but ships of war, and the anchorage and dockyard there are pretty well guarded by land batteries ; and although there is no guard-ship on this station, there are generally two or three armed vessels belonging to Her Majesty's service in the har bour. Should circumstances appear to call for it when I reach England, which I hope to do by the same mail-packet which bears this letter, I shall be in a position to submit to your Grace one or two arrangements by which, through the agency of tbe Ordnance and Naval departments, the defences of Cape Town and the harbour of Table Bay might, I think, be mate rially improved, at trifling expense, and almost immediately, which I should recommend accordingly. I have, &c, George Cathcart. Enclosure. Copy of Letter to Lieut.-General Jackson, Commander of Forces, Cape of Good Hope. Cape Town, May 8, 1854. Sir, \u2014 Although we have as yet received no notification of a declaration of war, the circumstances of the times render it highly necessary that we should be prepared to afford what protection tbe existing batteries at this port are capable of giving to tbe shipping in Table Bay ; and the present artillery stationed here is not sufficient. I have, therefore, to suggest the expediency of sending down without delay the detachment of Royal Artillery which has recently returned from the Orange River territory, or an equal"], [341, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 309 artillery force, otherwise withdrawn from the army on the fron tier, in order to provide for the more efficient manning of these batteries. I consider this precaution urgent, as not only there are seve ral Russian ships of war now in the southern hemisphere, but in the event of actual hostilities, and that any collision between the contending fleets should lead to a war of reprisals and retaliation, it is by no means impossible that privateers should immediately infest these seas, and direct their attempts to those quarters which are least guarded, and where prizes of most value are to be found. The batteries at this place, if the guns be sufficiently manned, are tolerably efficient, and the 73rd Regiment would suffice to prevent any attempt which might be apprehended from a land ing of the marines of any Russian ships of war now in these parts ; but unless the guns be more efficiently manned than they are at present, the shipping in harbour, not only of the colonial trade, but having valuable cargoes homeward from India and Australia, is not secure from insult even from pri vateers. I shall take an early opportunity of visiting Simon's Bay, and will acquaint you with any observations which may occur to me respecting that port ; but I am inclined to think the case differs from that of Table Bay in this, that there is nothing there of sufficient value to tempt an attack, or which would repay tbe risk of encountering an armed ship of war generally stationed there. The natural difficulties of all other anchorages on tbe east coast, including Port Elizabeth, would probably protect the craft that might be on them from any such hostile and, probably, unprofitable attempt ; but the nature of those open anchorages, so far off shore, renders any efficient protec tion from land batteries impossible ; therefore I am of opinion it is not necessary to weaken your force, which is scarcely adequate for its other requirements, by adding to any of the"], [342, "TEE HON.

I have given the perusal of this letter to Lieut-Colonel Ingilby, commanding Royal Artillery, in order that be may simultaneously submit to your consideration bis suggestions as to whether the detachment which recently came from Bloem Fontein, or some equivalent detachment, otherwise to be drafted from the frontier, may be more convenient as a re gimental arrangement of his particular branch of the ser vice.

My Lord Duke, \u2014 I have tbe honour to inclose certain instructions which I have taken upon me to leave with the Lieut-Governor, for reasons therein stated, and with a view of obviating any inconvenience which might possibly arise from my leaving this colony before the actual coming into operation of the new system of Government I have this day had a most valuable and satisfactory con ference with Sir George Clerk, Mr. Darling, and Mr. Rawson, tbe last-named having arrived, two days ago, from the Mauritius.

Sir, \u2014 As I am about to embark to-morrow in the steam ship \" Calcutta,\" on my return to England, the administration of the colony of the Cape of Good Hope devolves on you, according to the provisions of our respective commissions ; and I uow therefore place it in your hands. I inclose in this, however, a paper which I have drawn up with due care and due consultation, and, in points of law, with the assistance of his Honour the Chief Justice. This paper has also had the great advantage of being dis cussed this day in presence of yourself, of Sir George Clerk, aud Mr. Rawson ; and it is very satisfactory to me to know that it has met with all your approval."], [344, "312 THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S In adopting this course, I have several objects in view. First, I am anxious that tbe important measure of the intro duction of a new form of government for this colony, in the promotion of which we have been fellow-labourers, and which has now so nearly attained its final accomplishment, should not suffer any interruption by my departure, in obedience to a call of duty elsewhere, which I should not feel justified, under existing circumstances, in longer delaying. Secondly, I am anxious, as far as may be, to lighten the burden of your re sponsibility, by taking upon myself my full share. Thirdly, I am desirous of guarding against any doubt, or misunder standing, or cavilling, in respect to certain matters of form, which it is necessary should be duly observed, in order to uphold the power and dignity of the Crown, to establish and mark, on occasion of this first and all subsequent openings of Parliament, the relative positions of the three great elements of which it is composed, and give an example of order and deco rum which it is desirable should be preserved throughout their future proceedings. Lastly, It will, I think, prove satisfactory to Her Majesty's Government, and beneficial to tbe colonial interests, that, by forwarding a copy of the inclosed paper, I may place Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies in pos session of all arrangements which have been made, and which will have been acted upon possibly by tbe time they receive this post. In all necessary matters of detail which have not been specially laid down in any instructions which have been received from home. There is one point concerning which there appear to be con flicting opinions, and nothing is to be found, either in the Ordi nances or in any instructions we have received, to enable me to take upon myself the responsibility of pronouncing a decision. That is as to the appointment of the Chief Clerks of either House ; whether in one or both, it may be a reserved privilege"], [345, "313 CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. of the Crown, or whether in either or both, tbe privilege of electing these officers is, or may be, granted. I will not fail to bring this question to the immediate notice of the Secretary of State. In the meantime, tbe Government notice, which forms part of tbe inclosure, and which I have signed and ordered to be issued, is for tbe purposes and rea sons which it enumerates ; and this provisional arrangement, after it shall have served its primary purpose of securing order and obviating unnecessary discussion prior to tbe opening of the Parliament in due form, should the persons named therein not prove satisfactory to the majority in either House, I think it would not be desirable to resist tbe expression of parlia mentary opinion, but make another appointment provisionally, and awaiting the decision of Her Majesty's Government on the general principle, but adopting tbe nominee whom the majority of the House should recommend ad interim. The salaries would then be provided for ; and if the original acting clerks be not confirmed in office, no doubt a proportionate pecuniary compensation would be voted for their trouble. The Secretary to the Executive Council, who was also Secretary to the late Legislative Council, stands in the reserved civil list in the Con stitution Ordinance only in tbe former capacity; and having had several interviews on the subject with him, I regret to find he is unwilling to undertake the duties of Secretary to the new Parliamentary Legislative Council. Provisionally, aud until ulterior arrangements shall have been made by the members themselves, and to their own satis faction, it has been arranged that, in the first instance, the House of Assembly shall be allowed tbe use of the building appropriated to the Supreme Court. In giving you these my views and opinions, I also give them as instructions, which, in our present relative positions, I have a right to do ; and, in so doing, take upon myself tbe whole responsibility. If, however, circumstances, after I leave these shores, should induce you to depart from them, you will not hesitate to do so, but on"], [346, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 314 your own responsibility ; and I have no doubt your reasons would be fouDd satisfactory by Her Majesty's Government, to whom a copy of this correspondence has been transmitted ; but then my responsibility is no longer implicated. I cannot close this without thanking you for the friendly and able assistance and cordial co-operation you have at all times rendered me in the performance of the duties of tbe Government of the Cape of Good Hope.

Y"], [354, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 322 his Excellency's intentions, and for tbe transmission of appli cations, tbe Commissioners, in January, 1853, met at Whittle sea, to receive and record appbcations. Twelve hundred were filed, and, after a careful examination of tbe names of the applicants by those members of the Commission whose position during the war had enabled them to form safe opinions on the fitness and claims of the various applicants, to fulfil the in tentions of the Governor, two hundred names were submitted to, and approved of by, the Governor. These names appear in the list published by command on the 29th April, 1853. Since that notice, about thirty more names, principally Dutch, have been added, upon a more careful examination of the extent and capabilities of the country by the Assistant Surveyor-General, and it is probable that the country shown in the sketch,* independent of Mapassa's and the country lying between the Oxkraal and Khpplaat Rivers, will afford room for 250 farms. In the published list referred to, the farms were distributed in equal proportions to farmers of Dutch and Engbsh extrac tion. Eleven coloured persons, whose services and general bearing during the war elicited commendation from com manding officers, were also recommended to receive grants of land, they being in a position to build upon and stock their farms, and in other respects capable of fulfilling the conditions required. Prior, however, to any locations being made, the Assistant Surveyor-General, in pursuance of tbe Governor's instructions, proceeded to lay out and make the necessary preliminary arrangements for tbe estabbsbment of a village (Queens Town \u2014 plan annexed *) on a site previously approved of by his Excel lency. This was effected during the month of February of the present year. The site selected, on the Kommane, is pecubarly adapted for a village ; the ground very slightly falbng, the soil fertile, * Probably at Colonial Office."], [355, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 323 building material, both stone and clay for bricks, abundant and of good quality, and that great requisite in South Africa, water, plentiful and permanent, and with sufficient fall in the river to allow of any part, or tbe whole, of the stream being led out over the village at a small expense (vide plan*). In obedience to instructions, due regard was paid to the order and distribution of the town. Its defence, in case of attack, was provided for in the disposition of its streets and outer boundaries. The rapid progress and prosperity of Queens Town has already rendered this precaution compara tively unnecessary. Fifty erven, or allotments of half an acre each, were granted, at the rate of \u00a3& 10s. each, including surveying expenses and subscription for water furrows, upon condition that they were to be built upon and inclosed within a certain time. Fifty others were sold, at \u00a37 10s. each, to personal appli cants (only) upon condition of inclosing. The same number more could have been disposed of on the same terms; but, tbe Commission considering the object of estabbshing a town as having been successfully obtained, and sufficient impetus given, it was not necessary further to infringe upon established rules for sale, &c. Reserves were made for public purposes, and for places of worship for Episcopaban and Wesleyan communities ; and, by command of bis Excellency, twenty erven (ten acres) were set aside for the erection and maintenance of a Dutch Reformed Church. This will have \u2014 indeed, already has had\u2014 tbe effect of inducing the members of this Church to become permanent inhabitants of Queens Town, and will tend much to its pros perity and security.

SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 324 not fail (so soon as the road is opened, for which the country affords peculiar facibties) to secure a large market and com mand of trade ; and it will, doubtless, soon take its position among the largest villages on the eastern boundary. The correctness of this opinion is already established by a progress and prosperity almost unexampled, that must be firmly established so soon as the immediate country is filled up by the description of persons selected by the Commission for its occupation. Tbe opening of a main road by the colonial Go vernment along this frontier from tbe Buffalo Mouth, through King William's Town to Burghersdorp, and Aliwal North, would have most beneficial effects upon the trade, civilisation, and security of the country, comprehending works to which the attention of tbe Central Board of Commissioners of Public Roads could be advantageously directed. A glance at the accompanying sketch* explains that the country vacated by the Tambookies has been distributed into twenty portions, each portion holding about ten farms in the lower and fifteen in the northern part, the farms varying from 2500 to 3000 acres, an extent which, in a country not abun dantly supplied with water, and occupied principally for pasto ral purposes, is believed not to be too extensive for successful rallying, in case of disturbances, or too limited for prosperous occupation by the grantee. The reduction in the size of farms is a great improvement upon tbe system adopted on the border formed by the Cradock district, where farms were granted, twenty years since, on a very sbght quit-rent, in extent equal to 6,000, 10,000, 12,000, and even 15,000 acres, thus making the country a perfect desert with the homesteads ten and fifteen miles apart. The ten famibes located in each block are generally, and as far as circumstances will admit, connected by relationship, or have been neighbours in other parts of the colony. Where the * Probably at Colonial Office."], [357, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 325 land and water admit, the homesteads will be erected within rifle-shot of each other. The course of the Klaas Smits River, it will be observed, is occupied in this manner throughout its length, and a formidable barrier is presented on this line against future aggressions. In obedience to the Governor's proclamation, a mountain range forms the boundary, with one exception (at Nonesi's Basin), between the colonists and the Tambookies. This, of itself, presents almost insurmountable obstacles to cattle-lifting on a large scale ; while, at the same time, it completely sepa rates the two, avoiding all disputes and annoyances arising from stray- cattle, and questions as to water privileges and grazing boundaries, all very fertile causes of trouble, not only between black and white men, but white men alone. This description of boundary alone forms a most important feature in the system now pursued. The conditions attached to the occupation of these farms require no remark. They are perfectly understood by the grantees, and their necessity and practicabibty universally admitted. Their useful exposition and working must mainly depend upon the officer to whom the charge of the district is intrusted. His duties must differ considerably from similar offices in other divisions, and will be of a very debcate and responsible character. About the centre of the forfeited country, a Missionary Station, under the charge of the Wesleyans, had been esta blished previous to tbe war. This country was occupied by the petty Chiefs Bambani, Tobata, Vuma, and Tansi, and their de pendants, all offshoots from the family of the great Chief Umtirara. These people fought, and, as I understand, fought well, in support of the colonists during the war. Their claims to the land have been recognised by the Commission ; hut it is hoped the mode of grant will not be assimilated to those previously"], [358, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 326 made for these purposes, which give the land over in trust to a society for certain purposes, and practically place the natives entirely at the disposal of the teachers. Tbe system is, I bebeve, erroneous, and leads to evils of the greatest magnitude. The men in this settlement are sufficiently sensible to perceive the false position they are placed in by this system, and have asked to have the land granted to them on quit-rent, on similar tenure to the other farms ; and there ap pears no reason why the greater part of them should not be put upon the same footing as other occupants of land, having acted tbe part of good citizens during tbe war, and proved themselves, in a time of great temptation and danger, to be worthy of the privileges conceded to the white man. The survey of this country is proceeding steadily and well, and, in the course of the year, the titles will be prepared and ready for delivery. The expenses of this service are borne by the grantee ; no charge falls upon the colonial chest, and an accurate trigonometrical survey of the entire eastern boundary of the colony will be now produced, without any expense to the Imperial or Colonial Government. When my other^duties permit of it, which, I trust, will be early in tbe ensuing month, the location of Mapassa's country will be commenced by the Governor's orders, upon similar principles to those adopted north of the Swaart Kei. Numerous applications have been received for land in this country, and, as it is more abundantly watered than that reported upon, the system of concentration can be more strictly pursued. Mapassa's and the country lying between the Ox and Klipplaat Rivers will afford room for 150 additional forms. The forfeited territory will produce 400 farms, and 1200 armed men, without taking into consideration the force that Queenstown will supply, or the two field- cornetcies from Cradock, which, it is proposed, should be included in this division."], [359, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 327 The revenue arising from quit-rent alone will more than cover the expenses of its Civil Government, and the general revenue accruing to the Government from various sources will form a large item in tbe colonial receipts. It must be bome in mind, that every occupier of a farm is obliged, by the con ditions, to take into the country wealth, in the shape of stock to a certain amount, and the district, from tbe date of its creation, is thus made comparatively wealthy.

Dated at this day of 185 Witness Memorandum. The lower frontier of the colony, extending from the Mouth of the Keiskamma to its junction with the Chumie, ascending the course of that river to its source, in the neighbourhood of the Luhere or Gaika's Kop, including the Kat River Settlement, Fuller's Hoek, Bbnkwater, and the land occupied before the war by tbe rebel Hermanus, as also such portions of Lower Victoria, between tbe Fish and Keiskamma Rivers, as are unoc cupied by Fingoes, or have not been sold to land speculators, having been placed at the disposal of the Land Commission appointed by tbe Governor, Lieut.-General Sir George Cath cart, K.C.B., for distribution to fit and proper persons, in terms of the Government notices, dated 1st July and 11th August, 1853, the Commissioners have met at suitable times for tbe dispatch of business, and have received and registered about 350 appbcations for land in tbe Kat-River Settlement, and the same number for farms in Lower Victoria, the appbcants gene rally being farmers, or sons of farmers, who have served during the war, sustained heavy losses, and have no land in other divisions. In the Kat River, the claims of 250 Hottentots (Erf- holders), located in that settlement in 1831, upon a system conceived by the then Governor of the colony, and acted upon by the Com missioner-General, Sir Andreas Stockenstrom, prevent a judi cious arrangement being pursued for the subdivision of the"], [364, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 332 remaining portion of the settlement, and for its distribution among loyal and industrious inhabitants, in extent suitable to their requirements. For, although it is desirable that these people should be separated, and their habitations distributed, as much as circumstances will admit, among Europeans, it is re gretted that, the site of their erven having been already fixed, and, in some instances, titles issued, the surveys will have to be adapted to the form of the original design, which, however well suited to the system then pursued for Hottentot locations, is not favourable to European occupancy. Three hundred and fifty applications have been sent in for land in this settlement. Many of these, however, have been made upon the supposition that farms would be granted. This is rendered impracticable by reason of tbe grants already referred to extending in every direction over the settlement, with the exception of Blinkwater and Fuller's Hoek. In these localities it is hoped that ten farms of 1000 acres each can be surveyed for distribution, but in tbe settlement generally the old system of erven, with rights upon surrounding commonage, must be adhered to. I estimate that the vacant land and forfeited erven will sup ply room for 250 locations, varying from one to ten morgen. Each erf it is intended should be capable of producing suffi cient for the support of a family. These lands will be occupied by Europeans, English and Dutch, in equal proportions. The introduction of these persons into this too notorious settlement will, it is believed, have the effect of bringing this beautiful and productive tract of country into a fair state of cultivation and order ; while at the same time it must command a wholesome influence over the spirit of idleness that has been inherent in the Hottentots since its creation, and of rebelbon, which has latterly manifested itself among the great portion of them."], [365, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 333 It is proposed that the erven now granted should be charged with an annual quit-rent. The amount will not be large, but, in the aggregate, it will be sufficient to meet the expenses of the civil Government of the settlement. Upon the completion of the Locations, about 600 armed men will be secured for its defence ; and from its comparatively dense population, and the fertile character of its soil, it is believed that a village or town can be advantageously esta blished within its limits. This will be effected so soon as his Excellency has determined upon the site. At the Lower Blinkwater, on the site of a London Missionary Station, the original occupants of which being mostly rebels, a village is about being established. Its proximity to Fort Beau fort will not allow of its becoming a place of trade ; but it will be efficiently occupied by hardy yeomen, who can defend it when required to do so, and obtain therefrom, in times of peace, a comfortable livelihood. The survey of this settlement will be commenced at an early date. Much inconvenience has accrued, and still continues to occur, from the delay that takes place in the continual reference to Cape Town for information from documents deposited there ; but it is hoped that separate offices for registration and transfer in the eastern districts will remedy this, and be the means of removing a grievance long felt. For farms in Lower Victoria nearly 400 applications have been registered. Tbe extent, however, of the Fingo Locations, and the sales of Crown Lands which took place in 1849 and 1850, will not allow of more than 150 farms of 1000 acres being distributed upon bis Excellency's system. It is much to he regretted that a general rule for the sale of Crown lands for the British colonies should have been applied to the exposed borders of this colony, affording opportunities to speculators to purchase the more valuable portions, which are kept for the purpose of profit at convenient opportunities, to the manifest danger of the security of the country."], [366, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 334 Had the system laid down 15th May, 1844, for the sale of Crown lands been pursued for six months longer, the whole of this district would have been in the hands of capitalists, and probably have remained untenanted for many years, and the abandonment of that part of the frontier must have been the result, unless the Crown had re-purchased at a forced value, and occupied it on tbe system now pursued. As an instance, I may mention that one person (not a farmer) owns fifteen or eighteen miles of river frontage, which has remained unoccupied since purchase, thus ex cluding twenty farms with probably fifty defenders of tbe border. In this neighbourhood, near the Junction of the Chumie and the Keiskamma, and along the course of the latter river, twenty substantial farmers have been located by the Governor. Their lands are in progress of survey, and they are now living on them, and building. The intention of establishing a village (Aberdeen) on the site of a Mission (Birt's) Station is likely to be successful. It will be of the same character as that at the Bbnkwater, and will afford profitable locations for about twenty persons. Its situa tion as a rallying place in the event of war is important. The prospect of the immediate occupancy of Lower Victoria affords a favourable opportunity for the erection of a town (Waterloo), on a similar principle to Queens Town, on a site determined upon by the Governor, between Peddie and the sea. I entertain no doubt of tbe rapid progress of this town. It will be highly useful as a depot for stores, &c, in the event of Waterloo Bay being again used as a port for discharging cargoes, for which purpose many persons speak favourably of it, though, as an Engineer, I do not entertain the same opinion. Fisheries might be estabbsbed on the coast, which pursuit, in conjunction with fanning, would be highly remunerative. In addition to the strength afforded by the occupations"], [367, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 335 referred to, the Fingoes' locations must form an important defence. The thrifty, sober, and saving habits of these people dis tinguish them from the Kafir and dissolute Hottentot ; and it is thought, by a careful study of then- wants, a strict observance of promises of Government through its officers, a judicious system of useful instruction, combined with a due bberabty in the distribution of permanent grants of land on quit-rent, and other privileges, that a lasting bond will be made with them, to the mutual advantage of the colonists and themselves. I am not in a position to state what number of these people occupy land on this part of the frontier, but the accompanying sketch* represents the positions of their locations. This division will furnish about 300 armed Europeans for its defence. M. R. Robinson, Asst. Surveyor- General, Eastern Frontier, Cape of Good Hope. September 5, 1853. Fort Beaufort. Extract from a Private Letter of Lieut.-General the Hon. George Cathcart. King William's Town, April 10, 1852. I had the most beautiful passage in the \" Styx \" steamer, and arrived with my horses, without difficulty, on Good Friday, at Buffalo Mouth. The moment I landed, a great fire blazed on a neighbouring hill ; and, in an instant, a succession of fires and smoke were seen taken up from mountain to mountain, made by Kafirs, to announce my arrival ; and it must have been known in the re motest corners of Kafirland in less than a quarter of an hour. They have been looking for this event with anxiety for some time, hoping I may be more indulgent than my predecessor ; * Probably at Colonial Office."], [368, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 336 but the Gaikas will find me just, but as strict and severe as they deserve. I had to wait till noon for my horses to land ; and then, with an escort, I set off to ride the thirty-six miles to this place ; the country and weather beautiful. It got dark at half past six ; and as I could not gallop in the dark, I walked my horse to Fort Murray, where I arrived at half-past eight ; there I waited an hour and a half for the moon to rise, and then got in here by midnight. Sir Harry Smith was gone to bed, but had prepared tea and a bed for me. This morning, I have had the most friendly and satisfactory conversation with him. I am delighted to find he thinks me quite right in all my views and intentions, which are to carry out his own, as we both think, to the best advantage. This cbmate is most delightful at this season. I have a comfortable quarter, but my baggage is gone to Graham's Town, we having landed it to go there with Martin, at Port Ebzabeth, in Algoa Bay. I shall have to stay here about a week ; and then, after visiting some posts, - go to Fort Beaufort, where I mean to establish my head-quarters, leaving General Yorke here. Extract from Private Letter. Fort Beaufort, May 20, 1852. You will very likely see all that I say about tbe progress of the war and public matters in print, as soon as you get this, and I regret that it amounts to so little. I left King Wilbam's Town on the 4th, and encamped that night at, or rather near, Fort White. I had a long train with me ; for besides the mi gration of head-quarters, and my Civil Secretary, and Inter preter, &c, I gave the benefit of my escort to a long train of commissariat provisions for the troops in the Amatolas. I suppose we had a train of fifty or sixty waggons, drawn, some by mules, twelve in each, and others by as many oxen. We"], [369, "correspondence on kaffraria, etc. 337 marched at dawn next day, and I left the principal part of the train at Fort Cox, and went on about three miles into the beautiful region of the Amatolas, which is a perfect little Switzerland. There, in the valleys of the Linea, which is a small mountain stream running into the Keiskamma, its source somewhere in Mount Macdonald, I pitched my little head quarter camp by the side of that of Colonel Michel, who is there with the 6th and 60th Regiments, &c. This spot is not marked on the map, but is nearly opposite Sandilli's old kraal, on tbe opposite side of tbe river, and close under Mount Mac donald. That afternoon, Colonel Michel having sent four companies on to the top of the mountain, which is an exten sive table-land, I clambered up with my escort of Cape Corps Cavalry, and rode over all that country, and nearly to the extremity of the ridge. The Kafir scouts, who were watching us in the neighbouring woods, gave the war-cry, and passed it on, as soon as I got upon the ridge ; but at the further ex tremity we saw a considerable body, chiefly sitting down near the edge of the wood ; and one man we observed holding a horse. We could not get at them with cavalry where we were, and the infantry was not with us ; but we only wanted to look at the country ; and, after doing so, we rode back to the camp. We were not fired at. Now, with regard to the horse we saw with the Kafirs, I have much reason to think there is a curious story attached to it. If my suspicions are correct, the joke is decidedly on the side of the Kafirs. You must know that it is the custom, when we halt in camp, to \"off-saddle,\" as it is called. Then the horses have their heads loosely tied to the knee with tbe halter, and they are all turned out loose to roll and graze for an hour or so. A chain of double sentries, with loaded carbines, is placed round them. They thus keep in a compact herd, and are safe enough. Now when we left the camp for my reconnaissance of the interior of the Amatolas, the horses which did not go with me were turned out as usual ; and were left safe enough. But tbe mules, upwards z"], [370, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 338 of a hundred, which belong to the commissariat contractor, were turned out without any guard but some of their drivers. The Kafirs have no use for mules, and do not like them \u2014 therefore never steal them ; but an unlucky person chose to turn out his horse with tbe mules ; and it having grazed near to the edge of the river, not six hundred yards from my tent, it seems an active young Kafir spy, lurking in the bed of the river, jumped out, untied the halter, and springing on the horse's back, galloped away with him round the whole amphi theatre formed by the bills which surrounded our camp, and actually crossing the track by which we had gone up the mountain, found another for himself, and got off; while, as I took time in visiting various places, and looking about me in a progress of five or six miles, I have no doubt the man with the led horse in his hand, whom we saw walking to the large assembled group of Kafirs, was the identical thief who stole the Doctor's horse. I regretted his loss, but was amused with the performance of the Kafir. We only heard of the feat when we returned to camp. I visited next day another camp I have established in the Amatolas, near the sources of the Keis kamma; and, to go there, passed through the Bomer Pass, where the first catastrophe of the war took place. I had with me four companies of the 60th Rifles and my cavalry escort. As soon as we got through the pass, I left my escort of Rifle men to dine there, and await my return ; and, with my Lancers and Cape Corps Cavalry, galloped over about three miles of tbe most beautiful open pasture land, and almost on a level the whole way. I got home without adventure to my camp. Since my arrival here, I have been much occupied in writing and re ceiving deputations of Dutch burghers and others. Among them, the Pringles, from Lynedcoh and Eildon, in Glenlynden. They are fine fellows, the present generation, and have suffered much, but behaved nobly. I must now close this, for the post goes to-morrow morning, and I have an enormous amount of writing still to do. This I hate worse than any part of my"], [371, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 339 business, none of which is by any means agreeable. I am quite well, but my head is not healed yet.* I will write to Marys and Louisa by this post, according to promise ; and I must write also to Abce,J to tell her about the town of Alice, near which I pitched my camp. Give my best love to all the dear children. I think of them every day and night. Extract from Private Letter. Fort Beaufort, June 19, 1852. Besides the ordinary business of the command of a very large and oddly-constituted army of upwards of 10,000 men, which is enough for any one man, in tbe midst of a desultory warfare, I have now coming on my hands tbe details of government of numerous and vast countries, which it was very easy to annex to Her Majesty's territories, but, if we are to keep them, will require two or three Governors or Governments to manage them. I have much trouble still before me, and many vexations ; but, on the whole, things go on to my satisfaction, and I still see my way through all my difficulties, and mean to persevere, in the full hope of being able ultimately to surmount them. As to my private affairs .... I have ten people every day to dinner, including my staff, and sometimes twelve ; and, notwithstanding war prices, and having often to fight for our supplies, we never want anything. Except at King William's Town and this place, I have never slept in a house since I landed, for the best of possible reasons \u2014 there is no bouse left with a roof on in these parts. When in camp, a very large portion of my time is spent in my tent, where, by Greville's good management, I am nearly as comfortable as in a house.

I care not for public opinion or popularity, so long as I am satisfied with my own actions. My head is not quite well, but I feel no pain, and am in very good health. This is the midst of winter. I have a fire every day, and often in camp we have had ice in the night, in our jugs, the thickness of a half-crown piece. I enjoy this weather, however, and some of my old Canadian moose-hunting precautions at night, and in my tent, stand me in good stead ; but without these precautions, I can easily understand how people get rheumatism in this cbmate. I have been to Graham's Town, to quiet the alarms of the people there. I have been to Kaf fraria to clear an important district and open roads, but the enemy would not fight.

Graham's Town, November 14, 1852. Since I wrote last, all has prospered according to my wish. I think all the clouds have dispersed, and the sunshine of peace appears. All my difficulties are nearly overcome. The Waterkloof is cleared, and is occupied in such a manner that it never can again become the haunt of thieves and robbers. The Amatolas have also been well worked and cleared ; but in such a forest as that there will be some stray wolves, for some time to come, lurking there because they do not know where to go.

The good old Regent Nonebi, the mother of Siwani, and widow of the late Chief Umtirara, when she found she could not prevent her people from being gradually drawn into the war by an irritating system of plunder and reprisals, bcensed by those sent to repress the rebellion, took all her nu merous and powerful tribe, and migrated beyond tbe river Bashee, leaving her own territory, which was within the colony, vacant. I sent to tell her that if she chose to come back with all her tribe, she was welcome to do so ; for she had done no thing to forfeit her land. She came back ; and her people having given up their arms and made submission, they will live happily, and under British protection, within limits I have now defined for them, in a beautiful country which bes to the north of the line of road by which I marched to the Kei, as far as Bram Nek, and they have the Balotta and Dagana. I am going there, on my way, with 2000 men, to the Caledon River, in the Orange territory. I go there to settle some troublesome little matters in which Her Majesty the Queen has been made to arbitrate, and which led to the little war which Major Warden began with the great Chief Moshesh. I go to arbi trate, and administer justice with the strong arm ; but I do not expect to have a fight. It is, you know, a question whether or not we should give up the sovereignty of the Orange River territory, which Sir Harry Smith added to the already over grown territory. But I must exert British authority, and fulfil engagements to which the Queen is pledged, before I do any thing towards giving it up. I must afterwards turn my attention to the Hottentots, who are now subdued and humbled ; but are still desperate, from circumstances, and plunder for sake of food. Tbe Constitution, as you know, has been postponed ; but I hope to have orders to carry it into effect soon. The people in this quarter do not care about it; it is an old story; they"], [374, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 342 never understood it, and are in no hurry for it, except at Cape Town. The Chief Kreili, against whom I made war, and burnt his place, and took 10,000 head of cattle in ten days, is so astounded at the facility with which he can be mulcted, so puzzled with my silence, that he has sent messengers with a first instalment of 1500 head of cattle, the refusal to pay which was one cause of my taking 10,000 ; and he has expressed his desire to make every possible amends, to pay all fines, and send a bundle of assegais in token of submission. Kreib is a powerful chief, and not the Queen's subject; but he is para mount Chief of the Gaikas, and he is now doing all he can to please me. The T'Slambies are as faithful as possible, and anxious to serve us. The Chief Seyolo, who gave himself up, and was here prisoner, I have sentenced to imprisonment for life at Cape Town. I begin to hope I may have executed my commission in six months' more time, and will then ask leave to come home. The Chief Faku, who dwells beyond the Bashee River, and whose tribe is said to be in number equal to that of Kreili, is Her Majesty's ally. He was ready, had I wished it, to enter the south-eastern portion of Kreili's territory and plunder his cattle. As on a former occasion, this chief had already captured 6000 head of cattle, for his own use and benefit, in Her Majesty's cause, when he was interrupted by tbe flooding of the Bashee, I have no doubt his co-operation would have been efficient if called for.

My dear Charles, \u2014 I send you tbe enclosed, which tells all my news. You will perceive that I was somewhat left in the lurch by the commanders of my two other columns, who went wild after cattle, instead of joining me in tbe plain of Thaba Bassigo by mid-day, as they were ordered ; for one was ordered to march across by a bridle-road, only clearing tbe head of the Basaltic Ridge, 600 feet high, which encircles the table-mountain of the Berea,"], [376, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 344 and preventing molestation to my column, which moved along its base with tbe guns ; and as to the cattle-driving, it was only intended on this day that so much as came in his way should be driven down to the appointed place of meeting ; but Colonel Eyre lost the whole day in driving 30,000 head of cattle about, and fighting for it, and joined me too late for any thing more. As to Colonel Napier, he was ordered not to go up into the mountain at all, but be conducted by his guide round the east side, and join me. The use of his movement was partly reconnaissance, and then to come round and meet us in the plain, when we should have enveloped all that had been driven off the hill, and this in sight of the chief's dwelling ; but Napier never came at all. They are both fine fellows, and therefore I say nothing about this in my despatch ; but soldiers will easily see that the fault is not mine that we did not make a better job of it. It was madness for Napier to take his cavalry up a mountain five or six hundred feet high, faced like Sabsbury Craig all round a table-surface of some three or four square miles, and up which there are not above two or three passes practicable for horses. They seem to have run wild after cattle ; and the Lancers, who were rear-guard, got into a mess by trying to get down the mountain-side by a watercourse, which they took for a path, whilst the Basutos got down the right path before them, and met them in a fix. I am glad to think the war is now over, and I hope to be able to get home ; for it is a most troublesome and thankless service. Ever your affectionate Brother, (Signed) George Cathcart. Extract. Graham's Town, January 13, 1853. Here I am again after my campaign, quite well. The en closed Gazette, printed in the field, will tell you my doings and"], [377, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 345 adventures. As to our fight with Moshesh, he was most se verely punished; but both my commanders of columns ran wild after cattle, and did not act according to orders ; so that I was left to fight the greater part of tbe Basuto army* almost alone t during half the day ; and the cavalry having, contrary to orders, gone up into the mountain, although they captured 4000 head of cattle, seemed to have got into a mess, particularly the 12th Lancers, who are too heavy and unwieldy for such pranks. If Colonel Eyre and Colonel Napier had done what they were bid, they would have met me about noon, and we should have smote the Philistines more severely ; but, perhaps, it is better as it is ; for, had the Basutos been driven to despe ration by loss of fives and cattle, tbe end would have been war instead of peace, as soon as I should return with tbe army, and leave tbe country unprotected. The description of Moshesh himself you will find in a book called \" A Tour in South Africa,\" by J. J. Freeman. He is really an enbghtened and, I believe, a good man. His country is thickly peopled and thriving. His people grow almost all the corn that is used in tbe Sove reignty, where the burghers only rear cattle, which they ex change for his grain. The country is very curious through which we passed. Along the right bank of tbe Caledon, the country may be described as one vast plain, undulating in occa sional small hills perhaps, but still a vast plain. Out of this, however, at from one to four miles' distance from each other, up start the most extraordinary and gigantic mountains, with per pendicular rocky sides : some pointed, and some with table land on the top, and broken into the most fantastic shapes ; here and there a continuous ridge of these, but, generally, they stand by themselves. * Large numbers of very expert, able cavalry, well armed, not bad shots. + The two companies of 43rd, Major Phillips ; detachment of 12th Lancers, Lieutenant Gough ; a demi-battery, 12-pounders, Captain Robinson, R.A. ; de tachment Cape Mounted Riflemen, Ensign Rorke ; 3rd Company of 43rd, detached from Colonel Eyre, Captain Hon.

There are two inns, and I put up at the Cathcart Arms, where they gave us an excellent dinner for a party of ten. It is scarcely nine months since it was all a desert, and I then first appointed the commission which carried and are still carrying my intentions so ably into effect, that a town (Queen's Town) of forty houses has grown up, with shops, court-house, and a market.

Extract from the Graham's Town Journal, Nov. 12, 1853. Since our issue of last Saturday, the Governor, Sir G. Cathcart, has returned to town from his tour of the Kaffrarian frontier, and we are assured is well satisfied with the working, so far as it has gone, of the system he has adopted for the settlement of our border, and the future security of the Colony. Of course, the measures already taken are merely preliminary, their permanency and suit ability having yet to be tested by time, and those contingent cir cumstances that are sure to arise in dealing with the barbarous people of this or any other country. We believe it is his Excel lency's opinion that this journal has been somewhat sparing in its commendation of his exertions for the welfare and safety of the country ; nor are we disposed to demur to the impeachment, though we may confidently submit as a sufficient reason for our caution, our oft-repeated disappointment, and the very strong tendency so apparent in every Governor, to look with peculiar favour upon his own plans, and with corresponding distrust upon those from any other source. This being the case, it may probably be the more satisfactory, not to his Excellency himself, who avows his utter indifference to popular opinion, but to the border inhabitants, to declare our con viction, after careful consideration, that Sir G. Cathcart has done more towards securing the safety of the Colony, and advancing the prosperity of this province, than has ever been done by any of his predecessors. Acting upon his own convictions, he has set aside all ulterior considerations, and has gone straightforward to the at tainment of his object, whilst with a singleness of purpose, and an unwavering confidence in the honesty of his own intention, he has laid down a system of border policy, which cannot be too highly appreciated, or too decisively commended. The bold measure of setting aside the Government land regulation, and establishing on the immediate border a living cordon of hardy practical frontier men, was a stroke of policy of the highest value, the full import ance of which can only be understood by those familiar with the obstructions which stood in the way of any such arrangement. The Compensation Commission of 1847 saw the advantage of this dis tinctly, and aimed at a similar result; but then in doing so they A a 2"], [388, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 356 were compelled to adapt their machinery to the then existing cir cumstances of the case. The commission were fully aware of the immense importance of settling the vacant border districts, with experienced colonists, men accustomed to danger, and ready to brave it. But to carry out this plan, a mountain difficulty, in the shape of the Government law regulations, had to be overcome. Those regulations forbade the local authorities alienating any public lands, except by open public sale, and hence the commission had to ac commodate their scheme to this peremptory restriction, and to en deavour to provide for the settlement of the border districts without infringing this inflexible rule. Their scheme of land certificate, referred to in their Report, would have accomplished this ; and not only so, it would have given the frontier men confidence in the Governor, satisfied the just claims of the sufferers by the war of 1846, and excited such a spirit in the country that would, it is more than probable, have counteracted that feeling of disaffection which subsequently sprung up and produced ultimately war, rebellion, anarchy, and bloodshed ; taxing severely the strong arm of the Bri tish Government as well as the pockets of the people, ere peace could be restored, and the chaos be reduced to something like order. General Cathcart has taken much higher ground. Without at tempting to accommodate his measures to the difficulty in question, his Excellency has swept the obstruction entirely away; he has gone straightforward, and we are glad to say he has received the reward to which his singleness of purpose was entitled \u2014 we mean the approval of Her Majesty's Government, and the confirmation of his proceedings. We say so far, our remarks having application to the Tambookie frontier, and to those portions of the Kat River settlement which have been forfeited by rebels, and by the late noto rious Hermanus and his robber bands. But, besides this, there remains to be provided for the efficient occupation of the Amatolas. On this subject, however, General Cathcart must stand acquitted by the colonists of the smallest blame. The utmost has been done by him to awaken tbe Home Government to the importance of having this country occupied by those who should be able to hold it, and if he has not succeeded, it is to be attributed to indifference in the home authorities, and not to any want of exertion on his part to awaken them to a true perception of the case. This re markable tract of country, as well as the tenure on which it should be held, is described by his Excellency in a despatch addressed by him to the Secretary of State (Earl Grey), on the 20th of April last"], [389, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 357 year (1852), in terms so clear and satisfactory, that for the inform ation of our readers we are induced to make from it au extract : \u2014 Extract of Private Letter.

This I call my Extraordinary Fund ; for my Ordinary Fund, which, for better security, I have also now caused to be de posited in the military chest at King Wilbam's Town, consists of various small items of revenue derived from the fines, licences, &c, levied in that little Sovereignty, and which are accounted for, through me, to the colonial treasury, in order to justify the usual requisite subsidy for carrying on the ma nagement and payment of salaries in British Kaffraria.

Yours faithfully, (Signed) Geo. Cathcart. Letter from the Hon. Lieut.-General Cathcart to Sir Charles Trevelyan, K.C.B., in answer to his ques- tions respecting Highland Emigration. No date, supposed October, 1852. My dear Sir Charles, \u2014 I have read your letter about Highland colonists, and considered it well. The fact is, I have four separate governments under my control, or, I should rather say, under my responsibility, all essentially differing from each other as to their pecubar circumstances. First as to the colony of the Cape of Good Hope, I cannot speak from experience yet much about the western half of it. There, I am inclined to think, there might be room, and even demand, for a certain number of farm servants, as in all other colonies, but no good opening for men of some little capital to set up for themselves with any prospect of advantage."], [395, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 363 It has been ill farmed and is used up, and this has been one cause of emigration from it. As to the Eastern districts, they are, you know, in a state of petty warfare, and the quarrel with the Hottentots has caused, no doubt, a want of servants ; but the country is so insecure that there is no present or warrantable demand for them. Want of water, long droughts, and the natural conformation and soil, render nine-tenths of the country available only for pasturage ; and small capitalists have become possessed of immense tracts of land, on which, when they can do so with comparative security, or even at risk, they accumulate immense flocks and herds, with very few shepherds and herdsmen ; and what they would like best is, that Her Majesty should, by military posts, find a substitute for shepherds and herdsmen ; and whilst those a bttle removed from the border might make fortunes, they care little for those who have been induced to try the same specula tion too near the border to succeed. We must be most cautious in giving anything like induce ment to come out on that speculation. The unfortunate in ducement given in 1820 to certain settlers to come out here, by a parliamentary grant of \u00a350,000, has become a troublesome obligation, and has been tbe best excuse for the expenditure of millions. As to Kaffraria, I hope to accomplish the expulsion of the Gaika tribe from the stronghold of the Amatolas; indeed, I have nearly secured this, and can do so by military occupa tion. Macomo is still in the Waterkloof, which he had never left, but I flatter myself go he must. That is 30 miles within the colony. Sandilli, Stock, and Seyolo are still at home ; but you will see by my despatches, which only profess to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing more than the truth, that they are likely soon to be expelled, if they give me time to do it, or more adequate means to do it, in a shorter time. Now when this is accomplished, the only way to keep their country is by occupation; and nothing but military occupation, by"], [396, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 364 fighting men, will keep them out. There might be organised and regimented colonists ; but old pensioners or chance colo nists would be murdered, as the inhabitants of the military villages were. The country is beautiful in the Gaika territory, and capable of anything, far superior to any within the colony; but whosoever wishes to possess it must be prepared to fight for it, and organised with that view. As to Natal I know nothing. The Sovereignty is the finest field, but all depends upon what they may settle at home. I shall be happy to subscribe \u00a35 to tbe Society; but unless you could send me out two regiments, duly organised and officered, to garrison the Ama tolas in the first instance, and then become settlers, with forti fied villages, I could not advise their coming here. You may, perhaps, be able to see a very able paper I received from Assistant Commissary-General Green, with whom I had previously served in Canada, and knew his talents and merits ; to him, because I could get no information from tbe former Resident, Major Wardle, I applied for something to guide me as to the existing state of things. You will have learnt offi cially by this time that I have, with the advice of my Assistant Commissioners, appointed Mr. Green to succeed Major Wardle as Resident. But the paper in question, though intended only for my private information, was so concise and to the purpose, and its accuracy vouched to me by both the Assistant Commis sioners (one of whom is since dead), that I forwarded it to Sir John Pakington. That paper will give you a clear insight into the circumstances and prospects of the Sovereignty. As to Mr. Green, I have applied officially to the Secretary of State, that, in order he should not be a loser by his appoint ment, which if the Sovereignty be at any time given up he would be, he should be allowed to retain his half-pay, which will keep him available in the commissariat service, where bis experience and talents must render him a valuable acquisition in case of emergency."], [397, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 365 I start for the Kei to-morrow.

My dear Maclean, \u2014 If not entirely extinguished we have got the war into a corner now, and that is on the eastern ex tremity of Kaffraria. Now it occurs to me that, in order to put tbe finishing stroke to it, and convince them there is no use in holding out any longer, it is our best policy to bring everything we now have disposable into British Kaffraria for a time \u2014 that is, to the front. The troops will be as easily fed there as else where; and I intend, therefore, to bring the Cape Corps and 74th Regiment to King William's Town, as soon as they are rested, for they are of no use where they are. This will require no great matter of transport, as I do not mean to keep them there longer than necessary ; but I tell you of this intention, as it may make a difference in your arrangements as to supplies. I shall probably give orders for this as soon as I get to King William's Town, which will have given both regiments a fort night's rest in their head-quarter barracks, and only three or four days' march into then* other quarters, which, I hope, will also be stationary. Should I have occasion for their active services they will be in tbe right place, and you have already provided transport and provisions at King Wilbam's Town, which must, of course, always be prepared for emergencies. Yours faithfully, (Signed) Geo. Cathcart."], [398, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 366 From Sir George Cathcart to Sir Charles Trevelyan, KC.B Graham's Town, April 14, 1853. My dear Sir Charles, \u2014 I have not written to you for some time past, for the fact is I am generally somewhat hur ried when the post day comes, and I know that my friend Maclean gives you the best possible summary of all important events. I am happy to think that my special mission has now been accomplished in as satisfactory a manner as circumstances will practically admit of. Circumstances I cannot make, but I have done my best to turn them to advantage. It has long been the custom here for newspaper scribes to run down their Governor, and prepare the most false and scur rilous articles for exportation at Cape Town, just in time for the departure of the packet, so that it may serve to gull the British public as \"the latest news from tbe Cape;\" and as I am 700 miles from the point of departure, and know not when the packet may sail, they have much the start of me. There is a Latin saying, however, which consoles me \u2014 \" Magna est veritas et prevalebit ;\" for although the true state of things is communicated by me to Ministers, the pubbc do not seem to benefit. You will, however, see, that whereas all was war and confusion when I came here, now peace reigns throughout Her Majesty's South- African dominions and all parts adjacent, and I am able to reduce the expenditure to the peace establishment. I am also myself confident that with common precautions this happy state of things may be preserved with comparatively little cost to Government. Maclean will have told you all the measures we have taken for a prompt adjustment of all claims on Government, and settlement of expenses chargeable to tbe imperial treasury. It"], [399, "correspondence on kaffraria, etc. 367 would be superfluous in me to point out to you Maclean's great merits as a head of the commissariat establishment, and I have derived a comfort and advantage from his presence at or near my head -quarters, which none of my predecessors ever possessed. He will, no doubt, call your attention to the ser vices of the officers of his department ; but I cannot refrain from making particular mention of the following officers who have come more particularly under my own observation. 1 . Mr. Inglis, who from the commencement of the war was in a most important position for active duties, and as a man of resources and arrangement for field service he has been most efficient, and evinced great ability. He is, however, I fear, now too much advanced in years to render active services in the field ; but I hope he may be favourably considered in anything conducing to his comfort when he retires. 2. I must, however, name another \u2014 Mr. Cumming, who is strong and active enough to do good service still, and I con- sider him one of the most efficient field commissaries I ever met with. He is punctual and correct, I am told, in his accounts and other office requirements, but of this there may be better judges, though, as far as I can judge, be appeared to me to be so ; but the point to which I can speak is his perfect management of all matters and requirements belonging to tbe duty of a commissary in the field. He was with me on two expeditions, one to the Kei, and tbe other to the Orange River, as acting head of the department in tbe field, aud I had every reason to be satisfied with his conduct on both occasions. I advise you to keep him in view for that branch of the service should it ever be required, for it is not every one that has a genius for it as he has, or has the advantage of the necessary activity and experience. 3. Another officer, who was no doubt selected as the fit person, Mr. Robinson, has rendered tbe most essential services to me, being placed in immediate relation with my military"], [400, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 368 secretary,* and through his indefatigable and able assistance our most intricate military financial affairs have been carried on in the most satisfactory manner; and I should be very ungrateful, as well as unjust, if I did not recommend him to your favourable notice. Mr. Liddle, my private secretary, is very grateful for his appointment in the department, and continues to give me great satisfaction. I do not know whether he will draw pay, but I hope he may, as I hope very soon to obtain leave to return home ; and in the meantime this is a very expensive place for him, he being a married man, and lodging and eatables very dear.

I have repeatedly asked to be relieved ; but I fear I may be detained some months longer than I could wish, as they think my immediate removal might have an unfavourable moral effect among the native tribes, who, I believe, really do respect and fear me ; and the difficult business of the estabbshment of a new constitutional Government is also in progress. The Duke of Newcastle hopes I will not ask to go home before the end of the year. Winter weather and comparative repose have mended my health and energy, but I wish I could get home. Extract from Private Letter. Graham's Town, September 13, 1853. Everything goes on well here, and all is profound peace. Tbe measures I have taken to secure the permanency of this happy state of things are already so far advanced, and so clearly defined and well understood, that I really wish they would let me go.

My dear Darling, \u2014 I returned yesterday from a very satisfactory visit to British Kaffraria. It is curious that the Prophet Umlangani gave up the ghost, I believe, the very day I crossed the Keiskamma, and was buried last Sunday without any fuss or honour. The Kafirs speak of the occurrence with the utmost unconcern ; hut, as they are always reserved and cautious in their expressions, it is not easy to know what they think and feel. The T'Slambie chiefs came of their own accord to see me at King Wilbam's Town. One day, I had Umhala and Pato to luncheon, and we had a long conversation. I told them I had no business to talk about ; for that Maclean was my mouth, which is their mode of designating a plenipotentiary; but I told them all about Seyolo, and why I determined to detain him. In fact, that he had been sentenced to be shot; but that I had saved his life, and now kept him at Cape Town, because bis return would put all the fat in the fire. Umhala said he was a young man, and had done foolish things; he ought to be punished ; and that, for the reasons I gave, be thought I was quite right in keeping him out of the way. He repeated this twice as his opinion ; once in answer, the second time sponta neously, in course of conversation, as his own opinion. Next * Died June 14, 1855. B B 2"], [404, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 372 day, Siwani and his mother, Princess Nonebi, came, with Seyolo's brother by the same mother, and half-brother to Si wani, who was as well dressed as any English gentleman could be, with a cloth shooting-jacket, a quiet waistcoat, and some sort of light-coloured trousers, all new, and of the finest mate rials. His manners and conversation are quite like a gentle man ; he is very good-looking, and of a lighter complexion than most Kafirs, Princess Nonebi, his mother, claiming English blood from tbe traditionary descent from one of the two ladies (Miss Campbells, I believe) wrecked on the coast, and about whom there is a romantic story. One, it seems, married tbe chief of the Amapondas of that day, who was Nonebi's ancestor. The chief Toise was also of that party ; but he was overdressed, having an embroidered satin waistcoat. My object was, to put them at their ease, and conciliate ; for, having the power, and sufficiently convinced them that we have it, there is no use in making them bate us. With the same view, I sent to Sandilli to come and see me on a particular hill in Umhala's country, where we last met, telbng him, as I did tbe others, it was a friendly meeting I de sired, and no business ; that I would come without escort, and unarmed; for he had expressed to Brownlee that he feared treachery, and did not bke to venture near a military post, for that he had been warned to be on bis guard. Who the rascals are who strive to make the mischief I have not yet found out ; but that there are such is quite certain. Accordingly, we met on 31st ultimo at noon. I had with me some of my staff, and no escort but an orderly to hold my horse. Some 300 Kafirs came from neighbouring villages to see the meeting, on foot and unarmed. I sent Dundas, Sandilli's brother, who had come over to King Wilbam's Town the night before, on purpose to ride out with me, to tell Sandilli I was on the ground. In a short time he made his appearance on the horizon at a gallop, with some fifty mounted followers, but when he came near walked up the hill. These late rebels wore their caross."], [405, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 373 I made them all sit down in a semicircle, the chiefs in front. Macomo and Botman were the only chiefs with him, for I had only desired a personal interview with Sandilli. I laid myself down in the centre of the circle, tapping my boot with my ijambok, a little whip made of hippopotamus hide. I com menced a familiar conversation, which was duly interpreted by Mr. Brownlee, Gaika Commissioner, who stood up, as did the half-dozen of my staff present, and who completed tbe ring. I told Sandilli tbe object of my meeting him was to convince him that I had no evil designs; but if he would trust me, he would find I was disposed, now that he was forgiven and at peace, to be bis best friend. They seemed unmistakeably pleased and grateful for my confidence in them, and we had a long conversation. Of course, Sandilli made a request to be allowed to return to the Amatolas; but I explained to him that, although I had forgiven him, and we were now friends, and I hoped would always be so, I could not say that the colonists had yet forgotten or forgiven their wrongs ; and that, even if I wished it, I could not let him or bis people come back, either to the Amatolas or the Keiskamma ; for if they came in contact with the colonists, little quarrels would begin, which would soon again make a great war ; that therefore I gave them no hopes whatever of being allowed to go back to the Amatolas ; for that I must keep that strong country between them and the colonists, as it was as much my duty to keep the colonists from injuring them, as it was to keep them from injuring tbe colonists. I allowed Macomo to speak a little, but my whole political dialogue was with Sandilb. Macomo began about being al lowed to return to the Keiskamma; but I cut him short by telling him that, as regarded the colonists, they had by no means forgiven him, and that I had fixed the boundaries now, so that there could be no mistake about them ; and that they must be contented with the fine country I had given them. I promised to send them two dozen spades, and advised them to"], [406, "THE nON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 374 be-rin gardening. I had observed that Dundas had bought two spades when he came into King William's Town the night before. Sandilb thanked me much. He said the spade gives bread, but the spade is of no use without the garden ; and the garden ground on the banks of the Kei is stronger and not so good as in their old location. I said, I could not help that, for I had no other land to give them. He thanked me again for tbe spades, and asked for some axes, which I also promised, and have ordered. I shook bands with the chiefs, and then got up, mounted my horse, and walked away, leaving them sitting, evidently pleased. I have since heard that this meeting has had an excellent effect in restoring confidence. I am convinced that with good-will towards them, at the same time with vigilance and the requisite power at com mand, the existing state of peace may be preserved without any serious interruption, for all time to come, during which the pro gress of civibsation in its natural course, not rashly pushed on by false policy, will render the task of keeping the peace more and more easy every succeeding year. I have given one of my horses to old Pato, who thanked me, and said I had given him legs. The poor old man suffers from an old wound, and cannot walk much. I promised a good bull, well bred, to Siwani, which I have for him, of an Ayrshire breed ; and I gave old Nonebi, who is not so very old, by-the bye, and very arch, a South American \" poncha,\" which I hap pened to have, of all sorts of colours. She put it on, and, no doubt, rode home with much satisfaction to her kraal. To Kama, whom I had not time to see, I have promised a house. A Missionary Institution, with a school of the Wesleyan Society, having been arranged for him in his new location (for he is really, I believe, a Christian), I have promised to build him a good stone house, as soon as he decides upon the site, which will depend upon tbe advice of his missionary, no doubt, as he bkes to bve near him.

My dear Trevelyan, \u2014 I regret I have not time to write more at length ; but my news may be summed up by saying that all is peace, and settling down as I could wish. I have now nearly done all I can ever do towards it, and hope soon to be relieved. Umlangani, the notorious Kafir prophet, is dead and buried \u2014 a good riddance. I have had a long and satisfactory interview with Sandilli and Macomo since in their new country. They would bke to get back into their old country \u2014 now, the Crown Reserves, and under military oc cupation ; but I told them they must not think of it, for I must keep it between them and tbe colonists; that it is as much my duty to keep the colonists from injuring them, as to keep them from injuring the colonists ; and if I suffered them again to be in contact, little quarrels would begin and worse troubles, perhaps, ensue.

Time will not allow me to say more. Sir George Clerk is at Bloem Fontaine, and I have no doubt will make a good job of his important business when he gets his instructions, but tbe delay is very inconvenient. You must not mind the open-mouthed clamour of the Cape press about giving up the Sovereignty. They are all interested ; for the Sovereignty was to them \u2014 the English speculators \u2014 a great gaming-table, and, moreover, out of the reach of the police. Outlaws for debt in the colony are great land specu lators in the Sovereignty ; and the mortgagers in the colony, particularly at Cape Town, Graham's Town, and Port Efizabeth, say they have \u00a350,000 at stake. No doubt a slice of the desert is good security for a bad debt. The Dutchman has no newspaper, and has not had time to open his mouth yet ; but he is not of the same way of thinking. Yours faithfully, (Signed) George Cathcart. To Commissary-General Maclean. Graham's Town, December 11, 1853. My dear Maclean, \u2014 I shall be much obliged to you to let me have an estimate in round numbers of the probable demand on the commissariat chest for service of British Kaffraria by itself, exclusive of the rest of the command, distinguishing the ordinary (I mean what the troops would"], [409, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 377 cost anywhere else) from the extraordinary in all matters con nected with the troops in Kaffraria, but not those refunded by the colony, and taking the force of regiments as they now exist at this time, which, although appearances lead me to hope that in due time some gradual reduction may be effected, is bkely to be the permanent establishment for some years to come. You are aware that Kaffraria is about to become a Lieutenant-Government Its ordinary revenue already more than suffices for its ordinary expenses. We have a balance of -\u00a317 on last quarter in our favour, and this without the customs of East London, which are a considerable source of revenue at present to the colony. Although we may not want to call upon the colony for aid from the Aborigines' reserve of \u00a314,000 per annum for the Kaffrarian civil service, as the whole measure of this occupation is to fend off the Aborigines from tbe colonists, it is just they should be made to pay something towards the expense of tbe military establishment in due season, and considering the really good prospects of Kaffrarian increasing \" inland revenue \" and great improvement of the East London customs.

Chief Moshesh, \u2014 I am about to leave this part of the world, and return to my own country, where the Queen com mands my service in another capacity. When I entered your country, a vexatious warfare had too long prevailed between tbe people of European origin and the native tribes ; and these were, in many instances, warring with each other, to the interruption of peaceful trading and friendly intercourse, which are things so necessary for the happiness and prosperity of all parties. I then made known, by proclamation, that I came amongst * Writers, issuers, labourers, and horses."], [411, "correspondence on kaffraria, etc. 379 you in tbe Queen's name to administer justice and right equally to all ; not to make war, but to settle disputes and establish tbe blessings of peace. Since that time, more than a year has passed away ; and from that time you have been true and faithful to the promise I received in full confidence, and which you have kept faithfully. As you promised me, you have kept your people in order ; and on tbe other hand, your neighbours of European origin have, from that time to this, resumed their peaceful relations with you. I thank the Great Creator and Disposer of all tilings that I was allowed to be the bumble instrument in restoring this happy state of things, which I pray God may long continue. When I entered upon this task, I commanded all classes and tribes of Her Majesty's subjects to remain quiet within their countries, and await and abide by my judgment and decision. For had I allowed them to take part, although I might have restored peace for the time, I should have left tbe seeds of future quarrels, which would have ripened into war as soon as I had withdrawn tbe Queen's troops ; and I am happy to think that no such cause of quarrel between you and your neighbours now remains. My friend, Sir George Clerk,* the Special Commissioner appointed by the Queen to withdraw tbe British sovereignty from the countries beyond tbe Orange River, who writes to me in terms of high respect for, and full confidence in, you, had informed you of all the particulars of this measure, and has made the necessary arrangements with you, in all that concerns yourself and people.

But it has been found that, in a country so extensive and so remote, such interference is calculated to do more harm than good in many ways, but especially by tempting different people or tribes to quarrel with each other, in hopes of British support being unduly obtained by the aggressor. But there is now reason to believe, that when the hopes of such interference by the British Government are taken away, each party cannot fail to see that their own best policy and interest is, not to seek a quarrel with its neighbour, but to five on good terms with each other, and cultivate peace. War is only just when it is necessary for self-defence, or when its sole object is tbe re-estabbshment of peace, with as little injury to unoffending people as possible. That these are your own opinions, worthy Chief, I have reason to know ; for you yourself expressed them to me in your own true and eloquent saying, \" That peace is as the rain from heaven, which nourishes the land and makes the corn grow ; but war is as the hot wind, which dries up the earth, and blasts the fruits of the soil.\" \u00bb I rejoice to think that, as the enlightened paramount Chief of many people, you have manifested the power and the will to govern them according to their best interests ; which power you could not possess, unless they justly esteemed and respected you as their father.

January 19, 1854. I find that I have not sufficiently explained to you the ob ject and intention of the policy which I recommend to Her"], [414, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 382 Majesty's Government, in retaining possession of the Ama tolas and the intervening country between that mountain dis trict and King William's Town, recently forfeited by the re bellious Gaikas, and now held as a Crown Reserve. You are aware that this Reserve is shaped something like a triangle, that its northern side touches the Colony, but that projecting like a wedge as far as King William's Town, which is nearly in the centre of Kaffraria, both the other sides of the triangle are in contact with the densely-populated Kafir lands which surround it on those two sides, the solid contents of which contiguous Kafir lands are five times those of the Reserve, and contain a Kafir population of 60,000 souls. King Wilbam's Town itself, you are aware, is 45 miles from the sea at East London, the only road to which passes the whole way through the location of the Chief Pato, and, with the exception of one or two small military posts, is exclusively inhabited by Kafirs. On the other band, the whole white civil population in the province is estimated at 1210, exclusive of the troops, giving a majority of black over the white civil inhabitants of possibly about sixty to one; and of the latter 703, or more than one-half, are inhabitants of King William's Town. Now, since tbe war, King William's Town being the apex of tbe triangle, which projects into Kafir land, has a direct communication through the Crown Reserve with the colonial boundary, which forms the base about 30 miles distant ; but this depends entirely upon the maintenance of our position in the Amatolas. The proper use of this state of things, and this advantage gained by a long and costly war, is the main point upon which I rest my con fident hope of a permanent peace. The improper use of it would infallibly, ere long, bring on another war precisely simi lar to the former one. Now, the proper use and that on which my hopes are founded, will be explained by the following points. 1st. By the possession and military occupation of the Ama tolas, the commanding key to the whole territory, it is intended --\u00ab\u25a0"], [415, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 383 to keep the Kafirs in subjection by force of arms, until it may be safe and prudent to trust to a sufficient moral influence over them ; to obtain which can only be a work of time, tbe establishment of a friendly intercourse and mutual good-will, and the acquirement of property by the Kafirs, by means of agriculture and a taste for the wants aud luxuries of a civil ised state of society ; that they may have something to lose, and the inevitable loss of property and social enjoyment would serve as a restraint against the savage propensity to rush into war on slight provocation or pretence. 2nd. On the other hand, being placed beyond the colonial boundary, this Reserve is intended as a salutary check against the reckless propensity of colonists to struggle beyond the hounds of legitimate and recognised colonisation as detached squatters, tempted by visions of large profits on extensive farms, and regardless of all risks. Colonisation, tbe full development of the resources of the small portion, tbe fifth part of tbe province called the Crown Reserve, is entirely secondary to the military occupation; there fore, no civil or political measure can be entertained by me which, in tbe slightest degree, mibtates against the primary object, that of mibtary occupation. I wish you most distinctly to understand that I abide by the principles laid down in the Government notice of the 14th of February, 1853, which it is my intention shortly to repub lisb, with some slight alterations as to its details. Those principles are: \u2014 1st. That the territory called the Crown Reserve is to be held as tbe property of tbe Crown. 2nd. In it, in the immediate neighbourhood of certain mili tary posts, and under certain regulations already provided, erven, or lots of land, may be granted for building bouses, with the requisite garden ground. 3rd. That farms of the requisite dimensions, and in suitable places for agricultural purposes, may be let on lease; but these must be in all cases enclosed."], [416, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 384 4th. No detached farm-houses will he allowed to be built on these farms if beyond one mile from a military post, and no such farms will be granted at all unless the tenant be a resi dent in possession of an erf, and with a suitable dwelling in the village, authorised to he built within the rayon of tbe mili tary post. 5th. The privilege of free commonage for grazing purposes and fire-wood and wood requisite for fences and building pur poses, is granted to all proprietors of erven. 6th. Any detached farm-houses erected in contravention of this rule,the officer commanding the troops will have orders to clear away as military impediments and incumbrances. As ad ministrator of this province your attention will still continue to be much more called to the judicious management and con trol of the Kafir majority of Her Majesty's subjects within the government in which you have proved so eminently successful, than to any premature attempt to colonise the small portion of it which is now left vacant by the forfeiture of the Gaikas, or only partially tenanted by the faithful Fingoes according to certain regulations and special permission ; and whilst it is, no doubt, your duty to attend to tbe welfare and interests of those inhabitants of European extraction who have settled, for tbe sake of trading or other motives, within the rayon of certain military posts, and that you are at full bberty to provide for any who desire to cultivate the soil under the above regulations, I must remind you that military control, not colonisation, is the principle of policy which has induced me to advise the retention of Kaffraria as a separate government independent of the colony of tbe Cape, instead of annexing it as a new colo nial division, or abandoning it altogether, and therefore the greediness of land speculators must be resisted, for, if yielded to, it would entirely defeat the object desired, which is the maintenance of a permanent peace. I have, &c, (Signed) Geo. Cathcart, Governor, and High Commissioner."], [417, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 385 Kafir Tribes. Extract from Letter of Hon. Sir George Cathcart to Colonel Maclean, Chief Commissioner, dec. King William's Town, March 29, 1854. Sir, \u2014 As I am about to be relieved in the government and command of Her Majesty's South African continental posses sions, I think it necessary to give you in writing the principles by which my own policy has been guided, and which I believe to be in strict accordance with tbe meaning and intention of Her Majesty's Government as conveyed in various despatches to my predecessor and to myself. 1. British Kaffraria is a Crown possession, and all inhabit ants of this province, of whatsoever race or extraction, are Her Majesty's subjects. Ample experience has led to the conviction that the only true and safe policy, for the present at least, is, to govern the several Kafir tribes within this province through their respective chiefs, that is, not to attempt to take away the long-estabbshed and now existing magisterial power of the chief over his followers, or attempt suddenly to Anglicise his whole system of govern ment, but rather to respect tbe chief; hold him responsible as a vassal of the Crown for the good conduct of his people, allow him for the present to govern his clansmen according to the accustomed Kaffrarian usage. The opposite course has been tried, and proved a failure, as might, indeed, have been expected, if the knowledge of this pecubar people and their circumstances and prepossessions had been as well known as they now are. 2. With respect to interference in disputes between native tribes generally, we must draw a wide distinction between the cases of those clans of Amakosa Kafirs which remain located by authority of the British Government within the province of British Kaffraria, being Her Majesty's liege subjects, and, on the other hand, all others who inhabit lands beyond the pale of c c"], [418, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 386 the established British dominion, which dominion, as regards British Kaffraria, is limited by tbe Indwe and Kie ; all those chiefs and tribes, which are beyond the pale, are best left to the entire settlement of their own intertribal disputes, so long as they do not infringe the boundary of Her Majesty's dominions, or injure those within the pale, who, as Her Majesty's subjects, are entitled to protection ; for it has been found that interfer ence never fails to produce evil instead of good. I have taken every occasion to make known to all missionaries or traders, being British subjects, who think fit to sojourn beyond the boundaries of Her Majesty's dominions, that they must make their own bargains with the independent chiefs, calculate their own risks, but not lay claim to any indemnification from the Bri tish Government ; and I have not committed tbe British Go vernment by any stipulations which might be made use of to support them in aggression, and give them undue influence, whether they be extra-provincial missionaries or traders, in their pious or commercial callings and private speculations, or take from the independent chief bis right of self-defence. Armed interference should not be carried beyond the border, without previous reference to Her Majesty's Government. In terference in the way of advice, and offers of mediation, are admissable, but these must be unaccompanied by any menace, for a threat, if unavaibng, must involve its enforcement* Extract of a Letter from His Excellency Sir George Grey, K.C.B., Governor of the Colony of South Africa, to Lady Georgiana Cathcart.

While they profoundly mourn the severe loss sustained by his country in the fall of this devoted and able officer, they are cheered by the reflection that the conceptions of his powerful mind in reference to this frontier, and the natives beyond it, will be worked out by one whose large experience, mature judgment, and public character, give the best guarantee that can be afforded of ultimate success.

He then told me he had carefully packed up the portrait,* with bis own hands, and that he should greatly esteem it for my sake. After some further conversation on frontier matters, he intro duced me to General Jackson, now our Lieutenant-Governor. I took a reluctant leave of him who had done so much for us, and wishing him, in my heart, God speed, returned to Gra ham's Town. I did not expect that he would so soon be required to take the field in the active service of his country, and on that account had delayed giving him an account of the continued success of the new settlement of Queen's Town, in which I had been entrusted with so considerable a share in the carrying out his measures for the defence of our troublesome border. * Of Mr. Bowker."], [422, "THE HON.

The advantages which were expected to result from the in troduction of intelligent, respectable, and industrious white men into this locality, are already visible. Substantial and decent houses and cottages are springing up in various locali ties, such as the village of Lower Blinkwater, Bay's Kraal, Fort Armstrong, Hirzay, Eland's Post, where a village is pro gressing. Not the least of these improvements is the com pletion by Mr. C. H.

It is to such a man you are called upon to raise a memorial \u2014 not a painted post or pillar, but a memorial such as he would have approved of, which may afford instruction and amusement, not only to ourselves, but to our posterity.

He was barely eighteen years of age when the great events of 1812 oc curred, and as his father was ambassador at Petersburg, the mind of the young Lieutenant of Carabineers (6th Dragoons) naturally turned to the theatre of war. Throughout the whole of the campaign of 1813 in Germany, and 1814 in France, he was with the grand army as aide-de-camp to Lord Cathcart,* and had the advantage of being present at eight great battles, including Liitzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Culm, Leipsic, and subsequently Brienne, Bar-sur- Aube, and finally the taking of Paris. Young as he then was, he diligently made notes of the occurrences of this period. For years he kept them by him, and employed at different times many leisure hours in their revision and arrangement; but it was not until the year 1850 \\ that he published what he terms, with the modesty which accompanied him through life, \" Commentaries on the War of 1813-14.\" This book I have carefully read, and I am sure that no military man will consider his library complete without it. The language is forcible and the style condensed with a rare severity, and being the production of an irreproachable eye-witness, the book will retain its place in the literature of tbe country, equally with the fame of its author in her military annals.]; * Who was, as a British General, attached to the Russian army, and his advice considerably aided in closing the campaign at Leipsic. + When doing duty in the Tower of London as Deputy-Lieutenant. X This book is thus mentioned in the \" Gentlemen's Magazine\" of January, 1855, in the Obituary. General Cathcart published, in 1850, a volume of Commentaries on these campaigns, which prove that, though so young an officer, he was an earnest observer of the lessons in the art of war given in the several hard-fought fields from May to November, 1813, when Napoleon (with the broken remnant of the vast army which, to the amazement of all Europe, he had brought into Germany after the terrible disasters of the Russian campaign) was compelled, with the shadows of his coming fall gathering thick around him, to re-cross the Rhine. A valuable introduction explains the several systems of discipline amongst the Allies and their enemies, and exhibits the influence of national character under the several circumstances of attack, defeat, and during long and arduous marches. The general line and move ments in line system acted upon in all the armies of the world from the time of Gustavus Adolphus is contrasted with that which Napoleon was compelled"], [428, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 396 After these events had restored peace to Europe, and Napoleon, exiled to Elba, had returned, we find Lieutenant Cathcart in the field as aide-de-camp to the great Duke at Waterloo. He continued on the staff of the Duke of Wellington to the end of the service of the army of occupation, and was reappointed when his Grace ac cepted the office of Master-General of the Ordnance. In that capacity he accompanied the Duke of Wellington to the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, to Verona in 1822, to Russia on a mission of condolence to the Emperor Nicholas, and to attend the funeral of the Emperor Alexander in 1826, but during the years he held the post of aide-de-camp he was usually engaged in regimental duty with the 7th Hussars as Captain. In 1828 he was gazetted to the command of the 57th Foot as Lieutenant- Colonel, but exchanged to the 8th* to adopt, partly by the fraternity and equality nations, so adverse to dis cipline, but universal among the multitude of conscripts, partly by the impossibility of bringing into perfect order such enormous masses of troops as his ambition and impetuosity rendered essential ; and it is observed, \" It is not just to disparage the old system, or unreservedly to approve the new one.\" a Two advantages were, however, attained \u2014 celerity of movement in the field, and the right use of reserves. A judicious commander will combine the systems according to circumstances. The book is altogether a plain soldier-like chapter of history, written by an eye-witness, who never allows himself to be tempted by opportunities for brilliant description from the force of purely professional narrative. * It would appear almost an act of justice to that fine regiment, the 8th Foot, to give in a note a few words recorded by Lieutenant-Colonel Cathcart himself of the period he passed with it. \" I was at Enniskillen to receive the regiment on its marching in. \"At this time it was under the command of Major Ball,b who delivered it over to me in perfect order, and to whose experience and cordial assistance I was much indebted for some time, until I had made myself master of those details of the service which are peculiar to infantry and differ from the cavalry, in which latter service I had served my 'apprenticeship;' and I have never found that cordial support and assistance wanting in him or any other officer of the 8th since it has been under my command, whenever occasion required it. At this time party spirit was at its greatest height, aa it was at the period of that agitation which, in the next session of Parliament, was yielded to though not terminated by the Emancipation Bill. My regi ment was composed of two-thirds Irish, and of its whole strength nearly one-half were Roman Catholics. With regard to party spirit, I at once took care to establish the principle that, as soldiers, we had nothing to do with politics, our duty being to support the lawful authorities, but not to interfere or take part of our own accord, in the disputes of the country. The regiment \u2022 See page 5 of Commentaries. byGenerlfBShcLr?. \"\"^ \"\" \"OW 'W\u00b0 Lie\"'\u2122-\u00ab>'-ColonelS who were in it when commanded"], [429, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 397 (or King's) Regt. of Foot, with which he served for about seven years in Ireland, Nova Scotia, Bermuda, and Jamaica. Peace succeeded the occupation of Paris, and there was little to gave me no trouble, and in the midst of the most violent party excitement we remained perfectly tranquil in our armed neutrality. I occupied myself in compiling a code of ' Standing Orders ' for the regiment, which I had printed at Enniskillen. It has been of great use ever since in keeping up a uniform, steady system of discipline, and has saved the necessity of frequent occasional orders. \" In the winter, when the ground was sufficiently hardened by frost to carry the men, I never lost an opportunity of taking them out in marching order, and by some extended skirmish, or outpost practice, improved myself and the regiment very much in the details of those duties which can only be acquired by practice. The steady barrack -yard drill was also not neglected. Dublin was the head-quarters in the next year, and in 1830 came an order to form the depot, and prepare for foreign service.\" Lieutenant-Colonel Cathcart embarked in July with his family, and the head-quarters of the regiment, and, after forty-one days' sail, they made the coast of Nova Scotia. On reaching Halifax, the adjutant, Mr. J. Irwine Whitty, was sent to Sir Peregrine Maitland (who was then Governor Comman der-in-Chief) with the effective state of the division on board ship. <*; \" Nothing could be more agreeable or instructive, in a military point of view than the frequent exercises and practices\u2014 sometimes under the com mand of the General, frequently with his permission\u2014 between the several regiments 96th, 34th, 8th, and 52nd, under the command of Colonel Fer guson * Rifles, Colonel Eccles, in a country formed by nature in every respect for light infantry practice on a great scale and within easy distance of our barracks: besides this, Sir Peregrine Maitland, who was very fond of these exercises, used to avail himself of one day of the assembled militia to have a still more extensive man\u0153uvre, aided by a combined attack of gun-boats from the fleet-about 400 sailors and marines. On these occasions we had between 4000 and 5000 men in the field, with a good proportion of militia as well as regular artillery. I valued these practices, in one of which I had nearly all the militia with my own regiment-the Sappers and Miners-and had to fall back, occupying and disputing all tenable ground for a distance of two or three miles against the Rifle Brigade and 96th-as useful practice m the manage ment of irregular troops, and, with the aid of two inspecting field officers whom I appointed brigadiers, I found the Nova Scotia Militia perfectly manageable and in their own country, which only admits of irregular, T TiSt nfantry warfare, I am convinced that with a small nucleus of r gular British troops to support, they might be rendered more availabl t a short time than a body entirely composed of regiments drilled to he Mghest pitch of barrack-yard proficiency, according to the system of the life was not destined to be prolonged beyond three years; so incZ queue of the emancipation of the negroes, it became necessary to drlw all disposable forces from the north as well as south, to place them within reach of reinforcing the troops in the West Indies."], [430, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 398 perform which would have its reward in honourable notices, promo tions, and decorations ; the superficial observer would conceive that, in the monotony of garrison duty, there is a narrow field for the energies and abilities of a commander. But the case is otherwise. Any officer, with any sense of duty and responsibility, will bear in mind that the happiness of many is entrusted to him, and he will by his conduct and influence show that he is never forgetful of the trust. It was in Canada that Lieutenant-Colonel Cathcart assumed the command of the King's Dragoon Guards, and it is of this portion of his career the writer would more immediately speak. On joining the regiment, shortly before the rebellion in autumn of 1838, he found that though the discipline, so far as field operations went, was sufficiently good, there was some disorder in the interior economy, owing to change of officers, &c, which demanded his im mediate control. He must have paid the greatest attention to his duties, for he was acquainted with all the minuti\u00e6 and detail, which can be only obtained by careful observation. Lieutenant-Colonel Cathcart was distinguished as a cavalry officer. No dragoon of any rank had a more thorough knowledge of every branch of that service. While with the 7th Hussars, it is believed there was not a better swordsman in it, either with the small sword or sabre ; and he was a splendid horseman ; nor must we omit his own peculiar way of man\u0153uvring cavalry. A small pamphlet* published by him on the subject, as usual for private circulation, is a masterpiece of the kind. He did away with the word canter, as only fit for the manege ; he made regulations for fencing parties, introduced a movement for troops to pass uneven ground, and handled them with astonishing facility. Only those in com mand of the frontier troops know the interest and care he took in their formation, and he was well repaid by the admirable and effi cient corps they became. We allude to the troops of Captains Sweeny, Jones, and Ermatinger. Generally in cavalry regiments there is less distance between officer and men than in the infantry. The horse is the great link of union, and they meet on common ground in so many places that the tone of address and manner become more friendly and frank. In this regiment the line of discipline was never passed. Insolence or disrespect to an officer was unknown. Indeed the captains were * Sir Benjamin D'Urban read this pamphlet, and recorded his approval in marginal notes."], [431, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 399 looked upon as guardians of the rights of the soldier ; and if any felt aggrieved by the petty tyranny of the sergeant, the retort usually was that an appeal would be made to the captain at mid day stables. Until Colonel Cathcart 's time there was no fixed rule. \" Contrary to standing orders,\" was an expression often in the mouth of men in authority ; but it had no meaning. His great work was a codification of the duties of every rank in the regiment. This book is written concisely ; yet fully explanatory on all points. It is unknown, for it was published privately in this city by Armour and Ramsay, fifteen years ago, aud distributed in the regiment. We question much if the copies are not nearly all lost, for it was entirely confined to those for whom it was written ; and that it should be a text book, it was put into the hands of the private as well as the officer. With a very distinct recollection of its con tents the writer affirms that there are few military works which can be studied so profitably, and if these lines should ever meet the eye of any high in power at the Horse Guards, he would add that it would be an act of the greatest public benefit to publish these \" standing orders \" * for the use of the British army. A civilian could study them with great profit, for they are indicative of the man ; the pervading principle is a high sense of duty, that each rank should fulfil the trust delegated to it; then, that trust was defined and the mode of fulfilment pointed out. To the humble he held out a hope ; he encouraged and cheered on by his written words, as he did in the bright example of his own pure life ; to those rising in the profession he dwelt forcibly on the urgent need of self-control and exertion ; to those higher in autho rity he inculcated the necessity of example and propriety of life ; in every page is the author's consideration for others apparent, and a high sense of duty is blended with the purest common sense and the greatest professional skill. Few regiments could be compared with the King's Dragoon Guards when under the command of this great and good man. During the whole period of Sir George Cathcart's stay in Ca nada (about five years), he took much interest in the development of the resources of the province. He was one of the Commission ers of the Chambly Plank Road, which was nearly the first of this character made in the country. With considerable knowledge of engineering, he superintended the whole work. It was in those * \"They are framed hi strict accordance with Her Majesty's General Eegulations.\""], [432, "THE HON. SIR GEORGE CATHCART'S 400 days that the government departments were newly formed, and it became necessary to determine their routine ; consequently from time to time circulars were sent round to those whose experience made it desirable to have a record of their opinions. In all cases Colonel Cathcart was consulted ; in all he replied, bestowing great care, labour, and thought on the questions sub mitted. We had intended to have alluded to his further career, but our space warns us that this communication has extended beyond ordi nary limits. That the life of this distinguished man will be written we feel sure, and then the more prominent parts will be detailed. His successful termination of the war at the Cape of Good Hope is fresh in every one's memory. A remarkable general order issued by him was republished here, and it was typical of the energy which was part of bis nature. In person General Cathcart was tall and slim; his face was characterised by thoughtfulness and in tellect ; the far-seeing eye being a marked feature ; calm and dig nified, without thought of danger, he was equal to every emergency, and his fine tenor voice was always distinctly heard in command. In manner he was the kindest and most gentle of men. He was, indeed, \" a chevalier sans peur et sans reproche.\" In the print of the Waterloo Banquet he is represented entering the door. Appointed to the lucrative and honourable office of Adjutant- General, he had every temptation to pass his last days in quiet, had he been so disposed. With no disrespect to the gallant officer now at the head of that department, and totally irrespective of the fate of General Cathcart, we regret much that his knowledge of the service had not an opportunity of benefiting it in that situa tion, as we are persuaded he would have done. But it pleased God that it should be otherwise, and his death has consummated the principle of his life. Even here its moral will have force. Let that wide circle of mourners in the four continents, where he served his country and the world so gloriously and faithfully, put this to their heart and dry the tears which fall unbidden when his fate is told, and let us reverently say, \" Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, that they may rest from their labours, and their works do follow them.\" I cannot but feel how imperfect is this poor and hastily-written tribute to the memory of a great and good man, but I can say that it is sincere. Knowing his worth and excellence, his unconquerable spirit and"], [433, "CORRESPONDENCE ON KAFFRARIA, ETC. 401 immense mental resources, I feel how great is his loss to the be sieging army, and a void is made from my list of living great men which never can be filled. He was indeed, \" Sapiens, qui sibi imperiosus ; Quern neque pauperics, neque mors, neque vincula terrent : Responsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores Fortis ; et in seipso totus, teres, atque rotundus, Externi ne quid valeat per leve morari, In quern manca ruit semper Fortuna.\" \u2014 Horace, Sat. lib. ii. 7, 86. K. Coteau Landing, December 2, 1854. Note. \u2014 General Cathcart commanded the King's Dragoon Guards upwards of six years, and brought the regiment, with the horses, back to England in 1844 ; and about six months afterwards retired on half-pay. In 1846, the Duke of Wel lington, as Constable of the Tower of London, recommended him to Her Maj esty as Deputy-Lieutenant of the Tower. This honourable office, in which he took great interest, he resigned when appointed to the Cape. During the time he held it he resided three months every year in the Tower, and his exertions for the due fulfilment of his various duties there, and benefit of its inhabitants, ob tained these words of approval from the Duke of Wellington, when he came to resign it, \" You have done so much for the Tower ! \" and kindly expressed a wish that some arrangement might be made, giving the possibility of resuming the office on his return ; but there were difficulties and objections, as to be Deputy-Lieutenant of the Tower of London is no sinecure, but an office of great importance and responsibility, and General Cathcart resigned it before his departure for the Cape to the trust and keeping of Lord de Ros, whom the Duke of Wellington had recommended to the Queen as his suc cessor. vi>i:ovi \u2022 During these years he had been, at the recommendation of the Duke, em ployed on more than one particular service : in 1847, in Cornwall; and in 1848 in London, in supporting the civil authorities. In both he was thanked by the authorities, and on the latter occasion his name was among those officers mentioned in the Duke of Wellington's letter to Sir G. Grey, the Home Secretary, as deserving of record ; and who, through him, received the expression of Her Majesty's approbation for the zeal and intelligence they In 1850 General Cathcart was recommended by the Duke to the Secretary at-War, as a proper person to be one of a committee of inquiry into the Naval Ordnance, and Commissariat establishments in Her Majesty's colonies ; and he continued engaged in this business when appointed to the Cape. For this also General Cathcart received a letter of thanks from the Lords of the Treasury for the \"valuable services \" he had rendered.
