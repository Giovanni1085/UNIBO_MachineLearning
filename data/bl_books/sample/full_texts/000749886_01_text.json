Its scenic beauty has been the theme of poets and artists, from the time the first poet or painter cast his eyes on the fair landscape. Wordsworth and Turner head the lists. It was very fitting that Farnley Hall, in this valley, should be graced with a superb collection of Turner's paintings. Every conceivable tint, in sky or tree, may be noticed from the windows at Farnley, and, passing upwards to Ilkley parish, we find rich meadows in the vale, luxuriant foliage in the highland dells, gushing fountains, sullen mountain streams, gurgling rills, roaring waterfalls, tumbling cataracts, and cheerful, sparkling river ; mountain grandeur, unscaleable precipices, stern, frowning rocks, heath-covered, sweet-scented moorland, musical with the song of bees, or enveloped in mist or snow. Seated on every variety of cliff and crag, the visitor here can feast his eyes and inhale the genial zephyrs, or face the bracing air on mountain top. Village scenes, charming country lanes, honest peasants, wholesome food, and all that makes a happy, contented country, abound Here we are far away from busy towns, from long, smoky chimneys, factory \" buzzers,\" whirling wheels, and screeching railway engines.

The Wharfe rises four miles beyond the small hamlet of Beckermonds, where it leaves the mountains, and in four more miles reaches Hubber holme, with its ancient church and dozen houses. Five mile's lower, passing Biickden and Starbotton (the scene of a remarkable flood, two centuries ago), is Kettlewell, and, receiving the Skirfare and Cowside beck from Arncliffe, a suitable name from the eagle cliffe behind it, Kilnsey, with its huge limestone* scar, is reached in three more miles. Passing Grassington and Burnsall, Barden Tower is reached in eight or nine miles, and, forcing its way through the Strid and two or three miles glen of Bolton Woods, the renowned Abbey is reached The Duke of Devonshire has added every facility that tourist can wish. Short of three miles, Addingham is reached, and a further three brings us to Ilkley. No little time must be spent ere the traveller may say he' has fairly viewed this wonderful variety of landscape. Each place mentioned requires a day in justice to the varied scenery, and with Cobley's On Foot through Wharfedale as a guide, much satisfaction will be the result. Entering Wharfedale by Menston, the Mensington of olden times, leaving the broadening lower valley to the East with Saxon Otley, two miles away, and Weston, of the Vavasours, still nearer, we pass Burley, the residence of the Rt. Hon. W. E.

LKLEY takes its name, good scholars imagine, from Llecan, the old British word for rock ; and Ptolemy, the geographer, who wrote in the first half of the second century, calls the place Olecanon. It is Olicana in Richard of Cirencester ; in the Domesday Book, Illicleia ; in the first Charter after Domesday, given by William de Percy, Hilleclaia; in another, a few years later, Illelaya ; and in another later still, Illeclat. In 1220 they spell the name Illeclay, touching nearly the modern sound, but one scribe of that era, who seems to have had a special genius for spelling, manages to make it Yelleilaia. In the Bolton Compotus, a.d. 1290 to 1325, it is Ilkeley ; in Kirkby's Inquest, a.d. 1285, Yelkeley ; in Speed's Chronicle, Hekeley : and on the rustic tongue it is Heethlay. The town, when we hear of it for the first time in human history, is one of the ten strongholds of the old fighting Brigantes, and if we count in with them certain poor cousins, the Parisii, who held a place of their own at the south-east corner, close by the sea, Llecan stood exactly in the centre of the sturdy little kingdom which was bounded on the North by the Tyne, on the South by a rough line drawn from the Humber to the Mersey, on the East by the German Ocean, and on the AVest by the Irish sea. In Leman's map of the Celtic and Belgic tribes, with their towns and track-ways, one of these track-ways comes down from the North to Catteric, and then opens East and West. The western branch runs right c."], [22, "18 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. through Ilkley, and thence taking the form of a rude bow, resting on its lower half, it bends round through Chester to Holyhead, and there it strikes the sea, while the eastern branch runs through Aldborough, the ancient capital of the Brigantian kingdom, and then shoots South by East clean away to London. Ptolemy gives Olecanon the rank and title of a city, but he means no more by this than what we should call a log fort in the woods, because Strabo says \u2014 \" The forests of the Britons are their cities, for when they have enclosed a space with felled trees, they build within it houses of a frail sort, and hovels for their cattle \" \u2014 and C\u00e6sar says they add, for the defence of their towns, a mound and a ditch. So we can see dimly, but with some certainty, what sort of place Llecan was in these old days before the Romans came, and why it was selected for one of the ten strongholds. The site would be chosen for this purpose by the first tribe that ever made its way up the river, with any insight for a point which could be easily defended. They would find a fine rugged emin ence, with a river on the North, of an ampler volume, no doubt, than now, for all the streams dwindle as the forests are cut down, deep gullies to the East and West, with swift, strong streams running through them from the moors, and on the South the great craggy steep. There was still a rude circle of rocks on the reach behind the old White Wells fifty years ago, tumbled into such confusion that you had to look once, and again before you saw what lay under your eyes ; the stones were very large, and there was no trace of lime about them, and this may have been a rude outpost of the tribe for the defence of the great living spring, perhaps, and also of Llecan, lying far below. Be this as it may, here was the very choicest spot on the river for such a stronghold as the Brigantes would build. Good grass for the cattle in the openings of the woods, plenty of fish and game in the waters and the forest, and this central position which made Llecan as the boss on a shield. It is, no doubt, true also that these Brigantes were rough men to handle in a fight, and confronted all comers with such a steady courage that even the masters of the world kept their distance for many years after the tribes in the South were in some sort subdued ; and then, when at last the Roman found he must fight them, it seems clear that he \"struck under the belt.\" The sovereign of the Brigantes, about a.d. 50, was a woman \u2014 Cartismandua \u2014 and as the capital of her kingdom was not far away, and Llecan was in the centre of it, her false face must have been almost as well known in our town as in her own. She was the wife of Venutius, the chief of a tribe in the Midlands, and of kin, by this marriage, to Caractacus, a soldier of the grandest barbarian type. He was Prince of the Silures, whose land lay far away South by West, and had to face the Romans first, as they forced their way slowly North and East. He was beaten in a great stern battle, had to flee for mere life, and the chance of fighting them again, and in this extremity he turned his face toward Cartismandua, thinking she would give him shelter and succour. Look-"], [23, "LLECAN. 19 ing again at the old map, one can see dimly where he would strike the track-way in his flight, and make for Llecan, and then, after a rest and refreshment, let us hope, steal down the river, and across the country to Iseur, feeling sure he would then be safe. He was wofully mistaken ; my lady was of quite another mind, she had come to an understanding already with the common enemy, and was quite ready to barter loyalty toward her luckless kinsman for what it would bring. So she gave Caractacus back a prisoner to the Romans, and thereby gave him the chance she could not dream of, through which he is set for ever to shine like a star in the immortal pages of Tacitus. But this was not the end of her evil work. She must needs fall in love with a lusty fellow who was much about her, and for his sake she discarded Venutius to the wrath and shame of those among her own people who still nourished the old traditions of virtue and cleanness of life held among their kins men. So there was a fatal division in the tribe, some stood still by the throne, some went over to Venutius, who would fain strike for his self respect. They took to their weapons on both sides with a will, and then the danger grew until Cartismandua begged aid of the Legions, and they were quite ready to help her, if by so doing they could plant a foot between the door and the door-post. They sent troops to uphold the tottering throne, and once within the lines, the subjection of the Brigantes was well begun. The gates of Llecan and the rest of the strongholds were opened from within through this division in the stout old fighting tribe, and it may be that if there had been no such division, the line of the Roman conquest could not have been carried beyond the line of the natural fastnesses which cut the waters flowing toward the Eastern and Western seas. Indications of the existence here of these or earlier tribes will be subsequently referred to in the chapter entitled, for want of a better name, Prehistoric."], [24, "chapter ii. \u2014 \u00a9Ucana, HE bad queen vanishes, with her lusty lover, about 54, a.d., and is no more seen in Iseur on the Ouse. The Romans could do no more than put their foot between the door and the jamb in this first ad- venture. Venutius, king of the tribe now, and captain, fought Aulus Didius, the Roman general, to such purpose that the invaders were glad to return South again, and we hear no more about them in Brigantium for some sixteen years. But in 70, a.d., Vespasian was made Emperor, and turning his attention seriously to Britain, he sent troops North again to bring these Brigantes with their King, who was still alive and in good fighting trim, once for all under the yoke. Tacitus says they were able to reduce the greater part of the kingdom and to ravage the rest, and so we may infer that this year would witness the ruin of Llecan as one of the ten strong holds. Still while the tribe was beaten it was by no means subdued, until about 78, a.d., when Agricola came to finish this job, which had now been in hand about a quarter of a century. And he was the man for such work ; he had been used to this kind of fighting, and knew just what to do. He went through the North in 78 and 79, a.d., with a stern and steady tramp, sweeping all before him, but there was grace in the man as well as power; so while he was like the stroke of doom to those who would still insist on fighting for the old freedom, he was gentle as the breath of June to those who came pleading for mercy to his camp. The result seems to have been that those who were not slain, but could not submit, fled away beyond the Tyne, and joined the Caledonians, while those who could bear the yoke settled down, and very soon began to make their life take on some thin veneer of civility. And when the bitter fight was over, Agricola built a line of fortresses to hold the land he had conquered in strict subjection, and to defend it against the wild and wilful tribes farther North, and he did this work so well that when Tacitus comes to speak of it toward the close of the century, he says, ' not so much as one of these fortresses has been taken by force or abandoned in despair.'"], [25, "OLICANA. 21 Now it is quite probable that the country as far North as Catteric had been held by the invaders during the eight years that elapse from the time when the land was ' ravaged ' to the conquest of Agricola. We find the new masters were working the mines in Netherdale, smelting lead, casting it into pigs with the Emperor's brand on them, and carting it across Dacre Pasture as early as 81, a.d., and this would take more time, we think, than the short space we have to allow them between Agricola's invasion and the casting of those pigs. But the building of these fortresses which were to stand good through the centuries, may fairly be given to these years 78 and 79, a.d. Olicana would be one of them, and on the 23rd of June, 79, a.d., Vespasian died in Rome. So some thing from the same mighty hand and brain touches the foundations we can still see cropping out above the greensward on the Castle Hill at Ilkley, which wrought the great devastation and woe on the City and Temple at Jerusalem, through Titus, less than ten years before this work was done. Whitaker, the historian of Manchester, came to Ilkley about 120 years ago, when the remains of the ancient fortress and town were more numerous and clearly seen than now, and as his account of them is by far the best in existence, we will copy his report. He says \u2014 \u25a0\" The area of the Roman Camp in Ilkley can be clearly traced. It is pointed out by the appellation, Castle Hill, and by the remains of the rampart. The ground is admirably defended by the Wharfe on the North, and by two brooks on the sides. The western brook has had half its waters diverted into another channel, but must have been a lively current before this, and given strength to a brow naturally steep, and rising from ten to fifteen yards above it, but in the eastern channel the brook is still extremely brisk, runs about twenty yards below the crest ofthe eminence, and both of them discharge their waters into the Wharfe immediately below the Station. The camp was about a hundred yards by a hundred and sixty, ranging along the course of the present lane, and about twenty yards to the North of the road from Broughton to Aldborough, and the whole area contains about four acres of ground; encompassing the Castle and including the present Church and Cemetery. The wall of the station can be seen at the north-western angle, and is easily discovered under the turf along the whole verge ofthe brow, being of the rough mill stone grit ofthe country.\" \"The town was built very near the station along the course of the road from Broughton, in Banks Croft, Scafe Croft, and some adjoining closes, and there, fragments of brick, remarkably red, have been dug up, and the foundations of houses remain very visible at present.\"* These \"Closes\" lie South of Church Street, and East of Brook Street, and a good deal of the land on which the foundations of houses were very visible 120 years ago, has not been disturbed within the memory of man, and so there can be but little doubt that when it comes * History of Manchester, Second Edition, Passim."], [26, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 22 to be used for building, the richest treasure of antiquities still to be found will be turned up in those old pastures, but especially in and around the Castle HilL The hearth-stones are there of the ancient colony, and the dust of the household gods. These wise and able soldiers knotted four roads together close to the walls of Olicana, and in doing this marked their sense of the im portance of the station as a point for defence and succour. One of these begins at Aberford, where it touches the grand North road to Catteric and the Wall, and passes through Adel, which was also a Roman station, to our town. Connecting with this again there was a straight line to Skipton and Gisburn, and thence, West by South, to Ribchester. A third road came from Aldborough, through Knaresborough and the Forest, and struck across the moors between Blubberhouses and Middle ton ; and the fourth, crossing Rumblesmoor to Morton, bore away South toward Manchester.* Of these roads the remains were far more clear when men first began to notice them, and report their condition, than they are in our time, and we obtain a glimpse of this, from Ilkley to Manchester, through Dr. Richardson of Bierley, who was at the pains to trace it more than 170 years ago, and says in a letter to Leland's editor \u2014 Hearne : \" The Roman road is visible on Rumblesmoor, and is found in several places on Harden Moor, pointing across Airedale to the moor house above Morton, \"t And Whitaker, whose glance at Ilkley about 1760, we have just quoted, says \u2014 \" The Roman road appears on Rumblesmoor, a raised road, over grown with turf, keeping on the shelves of the hills to avoid the cliffs on the one side, and the morasses on the other, pointing directly to the Valley of the Wharfe, and to Ilkley.\" He also says \u2014 \" The road to Aldborough is found on Middleton and Blubberhouse Moors, being paved with stones uncommonly large, and edged with still larger, while the road bearing West is still traceable for three miles together from Ilkley, and then appears very conspicuous for a mile together upon a large moor in the parish of old Addingham. These are the reports of the Roman Roads made from 120 to 170 years ago. Forlorn fragments of them all may still be traced by the curious, but by far the finest remains still in existence are those of the road to Aldborough, over Middleton and Blubberhouse Moors, and these are well worth a summer day's exploration. This road, after leaving the moors, may still be traced through a meadow, South of the Manor House in Blubberhouses, by the finer tint of the grass which lies like a ribbon on the land ; from there it crosses the hungry looking pastures on the East of the road to Otley, and over the Washburn to Cragg Hall, where it takes the hill through a small plantation, and then, turning to the right, neighbours with the turnpike for a space on the way to Knaresborough. Fine reaches of Roman road may be seen on * Following the ma,ps in Horsley and Drake. t Leland's Itinerary, Ed. 1709."], [27, "OLICANA. 23 Guiseley and Addingham moors, and a little portion crops up in Stub ham Wood. Probably our word highway owes its name to the high character of the Roman roads. Olicana is not mentioned by the Roman annalists in connection with any event, military or civil, during the 330 years, or more, we have to count from the conquest of Agricola to the final departure of the Legions, and so we have to feel our way through these years by such light as can reach us from the history of the Roman rule in the North, and from the coins and inscriptions found in and near Ilkley, if we would invest the place with any sort of human interest. And touching first the story of those times, a period of about forty years is to be reckoned from the date we have suggested for the building of the new fortress in which our land had rest. The Caledonians had given Agricola a world of trouble, but they had been in some sort subdued by the year 85, a.d., and, at the least, made to keep their distance, and so we come down to 121, a.d., when Hadrian came over, and he came not to fight, but to build. He visited the fortresses and towns, and inspected them with the minutest care, ordering repairs or new works where they were needed, and so business would be brisk this year in Olicana. Seventeen years after this there was trouble south of the Tyne, and it ended in the confiscation of a good deal of the land the natives had held up to this time. In 180, a.d., the Scots, as we had better call them, broke into the southern province, and being joined by the native men, made great havoc, in which, no doubt Olicana suffered with the rest of the Roman settlements. In 198, a.d., there was very sore trouble, of which we shall find a record touching Olicana among the inscriptions This was met and mastered at last by the emperor Severus. And this is the end of the story of the Romans, as it touches Olicana. The last hint we have of their presence on the hill must be not later than 211, a.d. ; the rest is so weak it will not even hold an inference. abc Jnscripticns. Camden visited Ilkley in 1582, when he came into Yorkshire, \" that he might examine with his own eyes, and on the spot, some of those antiquities he meant to illustrate in his great work,\" * and it is to Camden mainly that we owe our knowledge of the Roman remains found at Ilkley which bear inscriptions, and bring us as near as we can ever hope to come to the life of the old fortress and town. The first of these in point of time, so far as they can be verified, he found \"in the church wall,\" \u2014 he does not say where, but later anti quaries saw it in a buttress \"at the South-east end ofthe church.\" This stone is now lost.

The tablet bearing this inscription must have been set up between 161, a.d., and 169, as in the former year these Emperors assumed the purple together, and in the latter Verus died. And as Verus was a very fair sort of person before he ascended the throne, but grew vile and mean after that, living a shameful life, our own judgment is that the tablet would be printed and published very soon after the news reached Olicana of the succession of the new Emperors before Verus had time to come forth in his new character of glutton and buffoon, because at any time after this no Roman gentleman, one imagines, would declare Verus ' beloved of Jupiter,' if there was any loyalty to the truth in his heart. Antoninus died in 180. Ofthe gallant soldier, C\u00e6cilius, nothing seems to be known, and the object of this commemorative inscription is likewise undiscovered. Accounts of the Emperors Marcus Aurelius, Antoninus and Lucius Verus will be found in the Roman Histories. The next inscription we can fairly verify had been 'lately dug up near the church,' Camden says, * and it points, we presume, to the one incident we can find which connects Olicana with the history we have tried to follow.

Restored under the care of Virius Lupus, their Legate. im SEVERUS AUG. ET ANTONINUS C\u00c6S DESTINATUS RESTITUERUNT CURAN TE VIRIO LUPO LEG E ORUM PR. PR. Pro Praetor. To understand this inscription, we must return for a moment to the trouble to which it must refer. In 198, A.D., the Scots saw there was a chance for them to make a raid oathe fair provinces to the South, which had been left defenceless because the legions had been drawn away to the continent to fight in a quarrel between Severus and Albinus, who had been Governor of Britain, and wanted now to clutch the crown of the C\u00e6sars. So they came swarming over the bulwarks built in Hadrian's time to keep them out, and wasted the land with spear and fire. Severus settled with Albinus in a great battle near Lyons, was made Emperor, and then hearing of the wild work these Scots were doing, he sent Virius Lupus over speedily with troops to drive them North again, and put a stop to the devastation. But Lupus was not the man for the time. He tried gold where steel was the true currency, bought their prisoners from * Gough's Camden, Ed. 1806."], [29, "OLICANA. 25 them instead of cutting the cords with his sword, and this led them naturally to the conclusion that he was afraid to fight. There were some years of this paltering, seven or eight, during which things drifted from bad to worse, and then the poor man wrote to his master, and told him they had \"broken into revolt, and were making havoc again, far and near,\" would he not then send more troops or come himself, and see to it once for alL Severus came over in 207, a.d., and though he was getting into years and had the gout he cleared the land of the raiders in no long time, but at a cost, it is said, of 50,000 of his men ; built that great stone wall as a sure defence against them from sea to sea, of which fragments still remain, finished it in the year 210, and then retired to York quite worn out to die in a.d. 211. Now it is clear that Virius Lupus had his hands full from his own advent into Britain to that of his master, and had other work to do beside restoring stations and towns the Scots had plundered and burnt, nor was Caracalla associated with Severus as C\u00e6sar elect before the Emperor came into Britain ; so we conclude that Olicana was restored about 209, a.d., and that Virius Lupus himself was busy about the building. There is but one notice beside of this unfortunate man among the inscriptions found in Britain, and curiously enough it is inscribed to the Goddess of Fortune, and opens the question, if it were worth our while, whether he was not an old Roman Micawber. It was found at Bowes (Lavatr\u00e6), and tells us that Lupus restored a bath there for the use of the First Thracian Cohort. And so one wonders again whether he ever noticed the spring gushing out on the hill above his new-built town and station of Olicana, or had it in his mind if the time should ever serve to turn the vast and beautiful fountain to the fine uses which have been made of it since his time. And as there is a \" Severus Hill \" in our parish, may we not venture to wonder whether the grand old Emperor himself did not visit the newly-restored fortress, pitch his tent on the hill, rest himself for some small space there, and sun his heart in the sweet sylvan beauty before he went to York where the three hills are (or were), which have been for all these centuries identified with his name. Camden also found a curious Roman altar ' under the steps of an house,' and copied the inscription : \u2014 To Verbeia. Sacred. Clodius Fronto. Ded. Prefect of the Cohort, *Second Ligones. VERBI\u00c6 SACRUM CLODIUS FRONTO D PR\u00c6F. COH. II. LINGON But Camden was not the first man of insight and learning who had noticed \u2022Another reading gives P. (first) Lin^ones. C"], [30, "ilkley : ancient and modern. 26 this altar, for a son of Edward Fairfax, the poet and translator of Tasso, says his father observed it some years before Mr. Camden came, and ' so late as the memory of the parents of such as live yet in the house, it stood in water.' This altar was removed to Stubham, we suppose in 1608, when William Middleton, Knight, had the sac-simile made which stands near the old home of the Beanlands in Bridge Lane, and if the words ' here found ' of the good knight are to be taken literally, the altar would stand on the outer edge of the western fosse, when it was still in its place early in the sixteenth century, and the water in this fosse was probably held back in those days by the remains ofthe old embankment. The altar, which is five feet high, is preserved at Myddleton Lodge, but by constant exposure it has become illegible. Dr. Bruce is of opinion that the Lingones Cohort, composed of Gauls, did duty along the Roman Wall. Camden imagined this a votive altar, dedicated to the Goddess of the River, and his opinion has been adopted by all the antiquaries who have wTitten about it since his time. Guer or Gurav, they say, in the old British, means rapid and rough, so does Guerf in the Saxon, and so we have the Latin approach \u2014 Verbeia \u2014 some imagine also that this devout soldier must have been in peril of his life crossing the river, and set up the altar in gratitude for his escape. \" The nymph of this beauti ful and animated river had an altar within the station of Olicana. Nor was this an idle homage only to her charms. Verbeia was dangerous as well as fair ; the Roman Trajectus was a deep and stony ford, and the prefect, Clodius Fronto, having unwarily plunged into its deceitful torrent, or been supplanted by the slippery gravel in its bed, might vow an altar in the moment of distress, and absolve his obligation in the calmer season of gratitude. Fourteen centuries after, Camden nearly met with the same fate.\" \u2014 (Dr. Whitaker.) In addition to the notices of sacred rivers in the Bible and other Oriental tomes, all English readers will call to mind the spirited lines of Macaulay : O Tiber ; Father Tiber ! To whom the Romans pray, A Roman's life, a Roman's arms, Take thou in charge this day ! Now this theory may easily be maintained, touching the name of the river. It is Hwerver and Hwerf when we first find the name recorded, * but we venture to suggest another meaning and purpose touching the altar, and it is this : Camden tells us the Britons say Guerif to cure, and his last Editor speaking of the curious bas-relief within the church tower, which is said to be a figure of Hercules t strangling the serpents, says, the tradition current in Ilkley when he wrote was that \" it is a statue of the Goddess Verbeia, and was antiently placed on her altar.\" It is to be * In Simeon of Durham's letter concerning the Archbishops of York. f In Pennant's tour from Downing to Alston, a sac-simile of this ' Hercules,' figures amongst the Antiquities of Ribchester, but no description is given,"], [31, "OLICANA. 27 noticed also, that there is a division of opinion about the old bas-relief, and a surmise that it does not represent Hercules but the Goddess of Healing, and one would think there was certainly room to doubt the Hercules theory when we come to examine the figure, in the engravings given by Horsley and Gough, in which the mighty and muscular old god looks quite slim and slender, and has a waist like that of a modern belle. Gathering all these hints to gether then, we would suggest that this altar was not set up to the Goddess of the river, but of the great pure spring on the hill, and has nothing to do with a tum ble among the slippery stones, when Clodius Fronto, the Ro man Prefect, escaped with bare life, and that Verbeia stands for Guerif the cure wrought by the waters which have become so famous since that time, and that this is the first precious hint of the Ilkley Wells. The sculptured stone, ' Her cules and the Serpents,' is in the interior North Wall of the Church Tower, but now concealed by the raised wooden floor. A plaster cast of it is in the Church. An other stone near the former, still to be seen, has the figures of a pitcher and the ' prefericulum,' or wine bottle in idolatrous wor- ship. Indeed the charac- ter of the stones at the base of the tower indicate long exposure to weather, and have evidently form- ed part of some Roman structure before the intro- duction of Christianity to Ilkley. Dr. Whitaker supposed the steeple was built of stones dug out of the fortress. There is one more inscription and only one; '*\u25a0 was f\u00b0und long after Camden's time ' in a garden wall,' and is a fragment of an old Ro man tombstone. This stone wandered away to Bolton Abbey in Mr. Carr's time, and was seen by the Rev. J. Snowdon, in 1846, standing in the porch of the Vicar's house. Dr. Whitaker states that Mr. Carr was the discoverer. He gave it to the Rev. Canon Boyd, who now has it at Arncliffe, but we venture to suggest"], [32, "28 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. that it should be restored to Ilkley. The inscription is made to read : \u2014 d [us] m [anibus] PVDE JESSEI LEG. II. A. To the Gods of the Shades. Pudentius. Jesseius. * Legion second Augusta. There is no hint on it of a date, but as this second Legion went North with Severus, and in ad dition to the fighting did a fine stroke of work on the great wall, it is supposed this officer died at Olicana on the return of the troops South- ward in 210, a.d., and was buried there with the honours due to his rank and station This exhausts the inscriptions, and the readers will see how they touch our hu man life, and cast a faint gleam across the dim old days when Ilkley was Olicana.

It is a family group, representing a father, mother and child, but the space for the names is left blank. Dr. Bruce, to whom Mr. Wardell forwarded a photograph of it, considered it unique as a group, but on some slabs, as at Newcastle and York, single figures are engraved. A most interest ing theory has been started on the import of this stone. Mr. Leyland, of Halifax, sees in the centre figure the symbol of priest, indicated by chasibule, cup, wafer, &c. ; with deacon on his left hand, and acolyte on his right. All the remains uncovered in the Grove district have been Roman, and the question raised is whether this is not a Christian relic of the /^-Paulinus age, a link of the first and second establishments of Christianity in Yorkshire. Another stone, about 2 ft. by 10 in., turned up when making the street West of Castle Hill, bore the figures of three animals and a few Roman letters below them. It was lately in the hands of Mr. J. E. Preston, of Gilstead. Many other sculptured stones have at times been discovered, but have been carried away by purchasers. There is a good nucleus at Myddleton Lodge for a museum, and possibly a few of the wandering relics could be brought back. Mr. B. Stapleton found a Quern near the Old Hall, Stubham, when engaged in the brickworks. This is now lodged with the Bradford Historical Society. The Roman road leading from the ford towards Stubham was also laid bare during the operations. Urns have also been occasionally discovered, one of which is in the possession of the Rev. Robert Collyer, who supposes it to be of Brigantian make. The coins found are now comparatively very few in number, and range only from Vespasian, 70, a.d. to Antoninus Pius, A.D., 161. But this may be fairly ascribed to the fact that the ground on which the station stood must have been turned over many times before these coins would be of any value beyond their mere weight in metal. A splendid treasure was found just over the moor at Morton Banks in 1775, w'thin the fragments of an ancient copper chest \u2014 the treasure chest of the troops, it is supposed \u2014 on its way to or from Olicana, and buried there to save it from some sudden swoop of the barbarians ; and some of these coins bring us down to 241, a.d., or eighty years later than the latest found in Ilkley. Similar hoards have been turned up at Light cliffe and Cleckheaton. A store was found by a farmer in the parish of Fewston, * which brings us down to Constantine, so there was money about, but the old fortress has yielded very little, nor have any other remains found hinted at such splendour as they have turned up at Aldborough and Broughton. We conclude, therefore, that Olicana was a way station for defence and succour ; a rustic sort of place, manned usually by the colonial militia, which would settle down on the land and marry, and raise families, and that only in times of great strife and peril there would be a Cohort of Lingones or other troops to man the fortress, guard the country, and come and go on the Emperor's business between the great stations.

The last date we can lay our hands on must be about 210, a.d., when the place was restored. But after the death of Severus there is a period of 70 years of what they would call peace in those days, and then the barbarians begin to feel their way to the coasts, and Rome is put on her defence until she tires and grows weak, and needs all her strength nearer home. Then there would be wild work in our dale, as there was everywhere. The mixed blood was not equal to the new crisis, the struggle for a restored Romano-British kingdom was marred by the continual inroads of the semi-savage tribes from Scot land, and disquietude reigned for several centuries until the Angles had got a firm footing in Eurewickshire (Yorkshire). The evidences of cave dwellings in Craven probably point to this period of unrest, when the old inhabitants, having fought with the dogged persistence of the old breed, fell back from defence to defence, and eventually took refuge in the limestone caves, wherein have been found Roman coins, fibul\u00e6, bronze ornaments, mingled with human and animal bones. We will now briefly give a list of such finds as have come under our notice. Many portions of querns have been unearthed; several good specimens may be seen at Myddleton Lodge, and at Mr. Hains worth's, Wells Terrace. Mr. Hainsworth has also a Roman altar, measuring 2ft. 4m. high, by 14 inches, disclosed in digging the founda tions opposite the Congregational Church. The altar is well formed, but the inscrip tion is com pletely gone. A Samian vase, or bowl, has been found, in fine condition, now lost to the dis trict. A very large water vessel, with two handles, was lately dug out near the Grove Fountain, and secured by Mr. M. Hainsworth. It is broken. Probably there was a manufac- tory of earthen ware in that lo cality, judging by the lumps of red and yellow clay, and the quantity of frag ments, glazed and unglazed, unearthed there from time to time. While excavating for houses in a field S.E. ofthe Railway Sta tion, in March, 1874, a rude cist of stones, about 5 ft. long by 2ft, was laid bare by Messrs. Robinson, cabinet makers, showing evidences of cremation. In the ashes and refuse a Roman Cinerary urn was placed, full of burnt bones ; and among them a number of beads, one a very large Cornelian. Messrs. Robinson"], [35, "OLICANA. 31 still hold these and other Roman relics. Good and perfect speci mens of earthenware were turned up some years ago behind the Church. Heaps of scori\u00e6 from Roman smelting works, formerly existing near Ilkley, have been carted away for repairing roads. A few flint flakes, but no bronze instruments, so far as is known, have been found. Mr. Lund, in 1874, found in his garden near Semon's Home, an artistic, circular-formed scraper. Of Roman coins, the majority seem to have been found in and near the church-yard, and disposed of to strangers and others by various sextons. Fine specimens are in the possession of the present Vicar, and Mr. M. Hainsworth. Brass coins of Vespasian and Hadrian, and two silver ones of Anto ninus Pius have also been found. Coins of Claudius, Commodus, Tetricus, Trajan, and Domitian are in Mr. Hainsworth's collection. A small urn, with nose and ear-rings, was found in Tivoli Place; hand millstones, whorl, stone celts, and a triple lamp in Roman light-red pottery, found near the National Schools, are amongst the modern 'finds.' A well worked female face, in potter)', was found East of Chapel Lane, April 6, 1879; Mn F. W. Fison now has it. A fragment of an ancient hand-mill from a French quarry, found in Ilkley, is in Mr. J. Hainsworth's possession. Messrs. Dean 3Brothers, have several antiquities, some of them Roman. A stone bearing the full-sized outline of a Roman soldier was found near the Congregational Church, and used, with little compunction, for road mending. Mr. J. Hainsworth thought that this and the ' group ' stone were for architectural rather than sepulchral purposes. During the construction of the old Gas-works, ancient pottery, a coin of Vespasian, a bronze pin, and worked-stones surrounding a spring were laid bare."], [36, "ILKLEY: ANCIENT AND MODERN. 32 On the site of the Railway Station the handle of an amphora with Voas in deeply incised Roman letters, and a beautiful vase, five inches high, of cream colour, the neck small with moulded lip, and the body thin, and light, were found, and the latter is in the possession of Mr. Israel Thornton, of Bradford. Mr. J. Hainsworth had a wine-cup of Samian ware, found on the site of Mr. Critchley's shop, Brook Street, which became the property of Mr. Longfellow, the poet ; also the upper part of an amphora. W. Fison, Esq., owns a large mill-stone, a small Roman altar, and a Samian bowl. From the site of the Midland Hotel, Mr. J. Hainsworth obtained a beautiful ash-colour vase with finger ornaments, and an unglazed light brown cup. He had also a stag's horn found in the Castle Hill cutting, supposed to have been used in British times as a pickaxe. The drawing of one in Canon GreenwelPs book is so like this that the illustration might be used here. In the North-west corner of the churchyard is a headstone in memory of ' Elizabeth, wife of Jonathan Smith, Saxton of this place.' The base of this headstone was found by the saxton when digging a grave, five feet deep. It is elaborately moulded on three sides, and seems to have been the capital of a large pillar. A somewhat similar stone is placed at the foot of the grave. Mr. George Parratt had a stone with representation of the hind quarters of a lion rampant in low relief. The excavations for Weston road and Castle road proved rich in evidences of Roman occupation. Here, the large foundation stones of a circular building, a floor of burnt clay, millstones, floor tiles, broken pottery, and a leaden bowl now the property of Mr. Thomas Clough, of Manningham, were found. The remains indicate Roman occupation co-extensive with the central portion of modern Ilkley, but the general opinion is that Castle Hill will prove, par excellence, the richest storehouse for the antiquary. It is due to Mr. Jonathan Hainsworth to state that much of this record would have been unwritten, but for his care in ' chronicling the finds.' In conclusion we will quote from Dr. Whitaker's description of the fortress and its camps, though Mr. Wardell supposes the latter to be British work. \" Ilkley is familiar to antiquaries as the Roman Olicana ; a name notwithstanding the concurrence of roads at the place, omitted in the itine raries, and preserved only by Ptolemy. The resemblance of the ancient and modern word is sufficiently obvious. The fortress itself, of which the outline on three sides is very entire, measuring about 160 by ioo yards, was placed on a steep and lofty bank, having the river Wharfe on the north, and the deep channel of a brook immediately on the East and West. The Southern boundary seems to have coincided with the present street, and the Hall and the Parish Church were evidently included within it. This circumstance is frequent in Roman stations, which have become the basis of towns or villages. Some remains of population continued to linger about them after that people had withdrawn, or perhaps their then remaining strength and security would engage the first Saxon possessors to erect their mansions within these enclosures,"], [37, "OLICANA. 33 and the site of the Parish Church was never far separated from the residence of the lord. The foundations of the fortress, bedded in indissoluble mortar, are very conspicuous, and remains of 3Roman brick, glass, and earthenware, everywhere appear on the edges of the brow. No account has hitherto been given of a corresponding apparatus of summer camps and outposts which appear on the surrounding heights. The first of these is Castleberg, in a commanding situation, on the brink of a steep rock washed by the Wharfe, about two miles above Ilkley. This post was naturally strong, as the ground declines rapidly in every other direction. But it has been fortified on the more accessible sides by a deep trench, enclosing several acres of ground, of an irregular quadrangular form. At a small distance, without the enclosure, an urn with ashes was lately found ; but what seems to evince, beyond a doubt, that Castleberg was a Roman work, is the discovery of a massy key of copper, * nearly 2 ft. in length, which had probably been the key of the gates. Copper, I think, would not have been used for this purpose by any other people to whom the work can reasonably be ascribed Opposite to Castleberg, and at the distance of two miles or more, is Counterhill, where are two encampments, on different sides of the hill, about half a mile from each other ; one in the township of Addingham, the other in the parish of Kildwick ; the first commanding a direct view of Wharfedale, the second an oblique one of Airedale ; but though invisible to each other, both look down aslant upon Castleberg and Ilkley. Within the camp on Addingham Moor are a tumulus and a perennial spring ; but, by a position very unusual in such encampments, it is commanded on the West by a higher ground, rising immediately from the foss. That inconvenience, however, is remedied by an expedient, altogether new, so far as I have observed, in Roman castramentation, which is a line of circumvallation, enclosing both the camps, and surrounding the whole hill ; an area, probably, of 200 acres. A garrison, calculated for the defence of such an outline, must have been nothing less than an army. But it would be of great use in confining the horses and other cattle, necessary for the soldier's use, which, in the unenclosed state of the country at that time, might otherwise have wandered many miles without interruption. The outline of these remains is very irregular ; it is well known, however, that in their summer encampments the Romans were far from confining themselves to a quad rangular figure ; and when we consider their situation near the street, and the anxious attention with which they have been placed, so as to be in view of Ilkley and Castleberg, there can be little danger of a mistake in ascribing them to that people. Yet I must not conceal from my readers, that the Western camp is called Woofa Bank, which seems to contain something of the sound of Ulpha, or Offa, and may therefore afford some ground for supposing it to be Saxon. When the area within this last was broken up, it was found to contain great numbers of rude fireplaces, * Mr, Wardell thought the doctor might have been imposed upon as to the size and material of the key.

Commentary. There is not one sure word about Ilkley between the restoration of the place under Virius Lupus, and the record made of it in the Domesday Book, and so our readers might well ask why this chapter was not omitted The answer is, we could not leap over this vast chasm of about 800 years for three reasons : \u2014 1. \u2014 Here is the place with a Saxon name taken from the Roman Olicana, as that again was taken, we suppose, from the British Llecan."], [42, "38 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 2. \u2014 It has grown when we find it again, from a Roman Station to a Saxon Parish, with a church and priest, and 3. \u2014 Before William's men laid the land waste this Saxon Parish con- tained four centres of life and industry : Ilkley, Middleton, Stub- ham, and Nessfield. So it is clear the place was never deserted and left desolate, or the name would have been lost, and that those who finally made their footing good on the land, lived and wrought to some purpose, or they could make no such fair show of church, priest, and a four-fold settle ment in the days of the Confessor. Indeed, the holms and meadows which lie so warm within the lap of Ilkley, would hold those who were left on the land, when the garrison marched away, like a strong mag net. The homesteads had come to them as the children of Roman fathers by native mothers, and had been held by their folk now time out of mind, and here was the old fastness where they could run for shelter, and defend themselves at a pinch against the raiders from the North and West. The story of these hapless \" half-breeds \" lies in thick shadows, but pathetic evidence has been found, in the upper reaches of the dale, that they were very soon driven away from the good lands below, and had to take refuge in caves and dens, with what little wealth they could save from the wreck, and to die there, or scud away to Wales when the coast was clear, if they could not bow their necks to the yoke of the new masters. So our readers will see the reason for the notes we have taken from the ancient Chronicles. Our town must have had her poor little part and lot in this whole business they report to us. The clash and clang of war, tempests, and woful winters, famine and pestilence, and peace brooding over the land like a dove in Edwin's time. They shared in the common lot. We have only to glance at the map of Roman roads to see how Ilkley could never hide herself away in the woods. Those roads were to that time what the railroads are to this, four of them met at a point a few rods South of the Wheat Sheaf, where the founda tions of the ancient smithy were still to be seen within human memory. They would make our connections close and sure, while they lasted, with the whole northern kingdom. Ilkley was not like a quiet, land-locked bay, shut out from the storms that raged all about her ; she was still in some sense centra!, as she had been when the Brigantes made their rude fortress on the hill. There is no word about the foundation of the Church, but it is fair to infer that it dates from the preaching of Paulinus, and that the Crosses in our churchyard are the seal and signature of his presence in our town, and his baptizing in our river ; and if he found the temple still standing in which C\u00e6cilius set up his tablet to \" Antoninus and Verus, of Jupiter beloved,\" the year 627, a.d., may be set down for the date of its consecration, through this sign, to the new faith. We know he was at Whalley, Dewsbury, Catterick, York, and in the region about Leeds and Halifax ; he could no more miss Ilkley in these journeys often, than he could cross a bridge without passing over the key-stone."], [43, "SAXON TIMES. 39 The town lay right in his path ; the eager missionary of the Cross would stay, and tell us his glad tidings. We can see him standing there through the glass Beda lends us : \u2014 \" Tall of stature, a little stooping, his hair black, his face meagre, his nose very slender and aquiline, and his aspect both venerable and majestic.\" We have cited the curious note from the Chronicle of Ethelwerd, under the date 670, a.d\u201e of a Synod held at Heth-lege, by Archbishop Theodore, simply to raise the wonder whether this may not be the record of some forgotten gathering called three years before the great Synod at Hertford. Ethelwerd's Chronicle is of use to us in filling up gaps in other Chronicles ; the name of the place is so very like ours in the later spelling and pronunciation, and Theodore was so busy during the first years of his residence in the northern parts, that we have felt the note might well stand with a perpetual interrogation mark against it, touching a place which would be so handy for such a gathering of the northern clergy \u2014 that and no more. The notice of the death of Archbishop Eanbald in the monastery of Etlete (Aet Laete), is also very curious when we notice the name, and that the site of this monastery is now lost. There were more than twenty monasteries in the Saxon times scattered over the North, of which many have left no more than their name. We lay no stress on this it cannot bear. The place was within reach of York on your feet, that is all we know, and that it was at Etlete. We touch ground we can stand on, though not in Ilkley, but in Addingham, when Archbishop Wulfere flees there from the Danes in 970, a.d., and abides there in safety. It must have been a time of great interest to the rustic population, and we may imagine them flocking eagerly up the dale and down to see the great man, and hear him, and receive his blessing. And in Edwin's time we shared the great boon, while it lasted, of perfect peace. 'With a brass dish, it may be, chained to a post by the wonderful spring he had seen as he crossed by the Roman road from our town to Campodonum, where he had his vill and where Paulinus built his church, not so far from the wood of Elmete as to prevent those who built the monastery there from transporting the stone altar Paulinus had set up, to the new foundation. And woe fell on us with the rest when the good King was slain by Penda on Hatfield Chase, and joy came with sorrow for those we had lost out of our homes on the hill, when Penda in his turn was slain in Winwed fight, somewhere close by Leeds, when the waters were out in Aire and Calder, and Wharfe too no doubt, that 15th of November, 655, a.d. While we may imagine those present at Godmundingham on the Derwent who had watched the mist on our hills, and heard the birds sing in our woods, and knew Olicanley. Present in the great council, and casting their vote for the new faith after that speech was made about the bird flying from dark to dark, pathetic and beautiful beyond expression, the purest bit of genius which has come down to us from those rude dark days, not the word of a King or of the"], [44, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 40 good Missionary, but of some rude rough Thane with whom it would be at any time a word and a blow. But a man, all the same, who saw visions as he sat by the hall fire while the storm beat on the roof and came rushing through door and window. A man with a deep brooding heart, in which the old lights his forelders had brought from the North were burning low and dim, or had gone clean out. How we should all have loved to clasp that man's hand when he sat down. It was the key to the great sad problem from the heathen side. A speech so sweet and wise and true that it had no option but to live until Beda came to treasure it in his book. If these notes are of any worth then, or the suggestions that rise out of them, our readers will pardon us for this attempt to make bricks not merely without straw but without clay as they may conclude. The day could never come when Ilkley would be left quite desolate \u2014 a wilderness in which there was no man. The children of the colonists would hold on to their inheritance for dear life while there was any hope or help left for them. Then these Angles would come in due time and drive them out, and entrench themselves within the old strong walls that could be so easily defended. The centuries pass and we see them dimly bearing their burdens, clearing the land on the Northern hill for new homesteads when the place grew too strait for them below, playing their part in therough drama, staunch and steadfast to thehearths, the altars, and the groves. Fighting grim battles, pondering awful problems, and finding the answer to them in the faith which changed the inscription on the very gravestones from \"To the Gods of the Shades \" ( Diis Manibus), and set them carving words which would tell us if we could find them now of the new hope and joy. Beneath this benign influence the uncouth Angle became the peaceful villager ; he settled near the old fortifications, cultivated his plot, welcomed fresh arrivals of Scandinavian cousins, and introduced the old system of tithings, which developed into Townships ; forsook the idolatries of his forefathers, but retained the heathenish nomenclature for the days of the week, superstitiously clinging to the old customs of well worship, beltein or fire-worship, the folk lore and traditions of yore, even when little remained but the habit. These settlers brought with them new names for their new homes, and thus we get Austby, Scallwra, Tadthorpe, Langbar, and Nessfield, with beck, dale, holmes, and other place-names of a Scandinavian ring, and Stubham, Middleton, Wheatley, and many more of Saxon origin. But though we have no runic inscriptions nearer than the one at Bingley, which records a peace made between King Eadberht and Ongus, King of the Picts, 756, we have in the churchyard at Ilkley the celebrated Three Crosses, so called, whose story we will now endeavour to give. Dr. Whitaker's account is as follows : \u2014 \" In different parts of the churchyard are the remains of three very ancient Saxon crosses, wrought in frets, scrolls, knots, &c, which Camden, with that propensity to error from which the greatest men are not exempt, conjectured to be Roman, only because they were placed"], [45, "SAXON TIMES. 41 within the precincts of a Roman fortress. But they are of the same kind, and probably of the same age, with the three crosses of Paulinus at Whalley, and with three others remaining in Leland's time at Ripon, which there is great reason to ascribe to Wilfrid From the same number, three in every instance, it is reasonable to suppose that they were early objects of religious reverence, alluding to the mystery of the Holy Trinity.\" Mr. Wardell, quoting from Father Haigh, says \u2014 \"In the graveyard, on the South side of the church, * are the remains of Three Crosses, the ornamented heads of which are wanting. The centre one is the most entire, and is about eight feet in height ; the others have * In which situation they were placed by the late Rev. J. Snowdon, Vicar. F."], [46, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 42 been seriously mutilated by having been, at one time, made use of as gate posts, but are now, it is hoped, placed beyond the reach of suture injury. These venerable relics are sepulchral monuments of the Saxon period, and of the same description as those of which only a few frag ments remain at Leeds, Dewsbury, [Guiseley], and other places. They are elaborately carved with scroll-work, and with figures of men, birds, and animals. The centre one, 16 inches by 14 at the base, tapering to r 1 inches square at the top, bears on the North side the symbols of the Evangelists in oblong compartments, human figures in flowing robes, each with the head of the animal which is his symbol, surrounded by a glory, and holding the book of his Gospel. St. John, the uppermost, has the head of an eagle ; St. Luke, the next, that of the bull ; St. Mark, that of a lion ; and St. Matthew, a human figure. The South side contains the figure of our Lord, and there appears to have been an inscription above his head ; then a device, composed of two animals whose lower extremities are knotted together ; and then two other monstrous figures. The remaining sides have scroll-work, with repre sentations of fruit and leaves. The Eastern one is about five feet in height, and very much defaced and worn. It bears two men facing each other, then two animals with their lower extremities interlaced, then two others, and, lastly, two birds. The remaining two sides \u2014 for the fourth is mutilated \u2014 are composed of scroll-work. The Western one is about four feet in height, and much more worn and defaced than the others. It has on one side a scroll and the figure of an ecclesiastic in robes, holding a book. The designs on the other sides are almost obliterated.\" In this stone the mortice hole for fixing the cross is to be seen. Various have been the conjectures regarding these obelisks ; one suggesting that the centre stone represents the old fable of the hero and the dragon, and placed as a monument to the hero's memory ; another, that the three stones shew that Paulinus preached here, though we now know that similar stones have existed at Ilkley ; others, that they are a reminiscence of serpent worship, interwoven with Christian symbols ; others, that the crosses were first placed in the groves by Paulinus and his assistants until the inhabitants could be induced to believe in the worship of God in a covered building ; others, that they were erected by Romans for some purpose or other, and fortify their statement by referring to the number of crosses or places bearing the name on the great Roman roads, as from Manchester to Cleckheaton ; this, however, seems certain that they are found wherever the Northmen or Scandinavian settled, and nowhere in Germany, Belgium, or Old Saxony. Christianity was certainly intro duced in some measure into Britain before the Romans left.* Constantine the Emperor, who was born at York, became a Christian about 320, and the cross was adopted as a symbol of purity in opposition to the rude monolith or pillar of previous ages which had a filthy signification. As Christianity became fashionable in high places so the workmanship * See conjecture in the Roman Chapter as to the signification of the \"group\" memorial stone, now at Myddelton Lodge, (p. 29.)"], [47, "SAXON TIMES. 43 became more ornate. Professor Stephens, of Denmark, has conclusively shewn that the crosses of that country and those of Yorkshire, Cornwall, Mona, Scotland and Ireland, \u2014 places overrun by the Danes, are of common origin, embodying scroll-work, interfacings, serpents and non descript animals. Mr. Romilly Allen, on the 27th of August, 1884, when the Yorkshire Arch\u00e6ological Association's Excursion to Ilkley and Otley took place, expressed his opinion on the crosses as follows :\u2014 \" All that now remains of what must once have been three very beautiful crosses, are the complete shaft of the central one, and the mutilated shafts of those on each side. The mortice holes for fixing on the heads of two of them still exist, and in the grounds of Myddelton Hall is a portion of one of the heads. A few years ago the base of the central cross was surrounded by three circular steps, which concealed the lower portion, as can be traced by the weathering of the stone. One of the other shafts was used for a long time as a gate post in the churchyard wall, and, consequently, shockingly defaced. All three shafts are now securely fixed in a new stone base, and it is to be hoped that there is no further chance of injury. The centre shaft is the most important, both on account of its great size, and the special interest of the sculptures. On one side are the symbols of the four Evangelists, and on the other the Lord holding a pastoral staff. From the 3rd to the 13th centuries, Christ surrounded by the symbols of the four Evangelists is one of the most common subjects which occur upon Christian monuments, but the method of representation changed considerably as time went on. In the catacombs at Rome, in the early centuries, Christ is symbolised by the Cross, and the four Evangelists by four books, or scrolls at each of the corners ; or, agiin, Christ is represented as the Agnus Dei, standing upon the mountain of Paradise, from the base of which issue four rivers, which are the four Evangelists. As early as the 6th century we find the Evangelists symbolised by the four beasts described in the Apocalypse. St. Matthew having the face of a man, St. Mark, that of a lion, St. Luke, that of a bull, and St. John, that of an eagle, and they carry either books or scrolls in their hands. Generally the bodies are those of winged beasts, but on the Ilkley cross the bodies are human. This curious deviation from the usual method of representation occurs only in a few rare instances, as on a Saxon slab at Wirksworth Church in Derbyshire, and in one or two MSS. Above the Norman doorway of Adel Church is a good example of Christ as the Agnus Dei, surrounded by the four symbolical beasts. In connection with the present subject, it may be mentioned that the cross at Clonmacnois, in Ireland, which is sculptured with scenes from the life of our Lord, is referred to in the Irish annals under the date of 1060, as the ' Cros na Screaptra,' or cross of the Scriptures, and the same name might fairly be given to the cross of Ilkley. Three of the panels of the central shaft are sculptured with grotesque animals, arranged systematically in pairs, and facing each other, or shown simply with one paw upraised, and the tails interlaced. The two sides are ornamented with scrolls of graceful foliage, such as"], [48, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 44 occurs on many of the stones of this period, within the ancient North umbrian area, but not in the Celtic MSS., or on stones in Scotland north of the Forth, or in Wales, or Ireland The carving on the two smaller shafts is of similar character to that on the centre one, con sisting of conventional foliage and animals, together with inter laced work, and in one case, a human figure holding a book. The meaning of the monstrous animal forms, which are found so fre quently upon the stones of this class, has not yet been satisfactorily explained, but, perhaps a study of the various manuscripts of the middle ages may eventually throw more light on the matter. In addition to the shafts of the three crosses in the church yard, there are fragments of, at least, two others preserved within the church.\" Mr. Allen has given us permission to copy the following from an article in the British Arch. Assoc. Journal, 1884. \" The earliest mention of the Ilkley Crosses is, I believe, in Camden's Britannia. That learned author evidently thought these stones were Roman, as will be seen from the following quotation : ' That it (Ilkley) was an ancient town appears from the pillars of Roman work in the churchyard and elsewhere.' * Gough, in his additions to Camden, written at the beginning of this century, says, ' In Ilkley churchyard is a rude cross, 2 feet 7 inches high, and 13 inches wide, ornamented on two sides with reliefs of saints, and the other two with foliage. Two others lie at the South gate, and the South-west corner of the church yard.' f This description seems to apply to the three stones still erect : but the height given, viz., 2 feet 7 inches, is too small for any of them, and more especially for the centre cross, which is the tallest of all ; but has reliefs of saints and foliage upon it, as specified. \"In Leland's /tinerary, although crosses at Ripon, % which have since disappeared, are referred to, no mention is made of the stones at Ilkley. In Hearne's edition of Leland (1745), however, a letter appears to the editor, from Dr. R. Richardson, a physician of North Bierly, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, which gives the following particulars : ' Ilkley is now a very mean place, and chiefly famous for a cold well, which has done very remarkable cures in scrophulous cases by bathing in and drinking of it. The last test shows it to be a vitriol-like water, tho' I have made no further tryal of it. The stones Mr. Camden observed in the churchyard are now broken down and much defaced, tho' some frag ments of them still remain in the adjoining walls ; and upon one is placed a dyal, on the west side of which is an human figure (tho' much injured by time) with a glory about its head, which shows these monu ments not to be of that antiquity Mr. Camden makes them, and not to claim a farther date than that of Christianity in Britain. Perhaps this ' Gough 's Camden, vol. iii., p. __q. t Ibid., p. 289. X Hearne's Leland, vol. i. , p. 90,"], [49, "SAXON TIMES. 45 might have been the tutelar saint of the place ; but I take them to be of the same kind, and erected upon the same account, as those Dr. Plot has observed in like places in Staffordshire.' \u00a7 \"In the twentieth volume of the Journal of this Association is a paper by Mr. T. J. Pettigrew, entitled, ' The Monumental Crosses at Ilkley and Collingham,' from which I extract the following : ' The crosses at Ilkley are, perhaps, as ancient, or nearly so, as those at Collingham ; but, unfortunately, we have as yet less assistance in tracing their history. They have not been treated respectfully, for two of them were used but a few years ago as gate-posts to the churchyard. The most perfect has long been erect in the middle of the churchyard. The basement-stone on which it stands is buried under the ground, and if it were uncovered would probably be found to bear a Runic inscription similar in character to that discovered at Collingham.'* \" Since the above was written, the old base of the central cross has been removed, and the whole of the lower part exposed to view. Mr. Pettigrew's hope that a Runic inscription might exist upon the hidden portion has unfortunately not been realised. The old base, as shown on the plate which illustrates Mr. Pettigrew's paper, and also on a sketch in Phillips' Yorkshires consisted of two circular steps reaching to a height of 3 feet 2 inches above the present base, making the old height 5 feet 2 inches instead of 8 feet 4 inches as at present. The lower part, which has been so long buried, has thus been protected from the weather, and is in much better preservation than the rest of the stone, which is sadly defaced. At the time the sketch in Phillips' Yorkshire was made, the two other crosses seem to have been simply stuck in the ground on each side of the centre one. All three crosses are now firmly morticed into a stone base 8 feet 10 inches long by 2 feet 6 inches wide. The crosses are ranged in a line running east and west, and are placed 2 feet apart from each other. An illustration of the crosses in their present state is given in the annual volume of the Ham Anastatic Drawing Society, for 1864, sketched by Mr. R. Tyrer, and also a wood-cut, taken from a photo graph, in Morant's edition of Whitaker's Craven. \" The following is a detailed description of the three crosses and six fragments, shown on the accompanying drawings (see Plate), which have been made to scale from rubbings, sketches, and photographs. \" The Centre Cross is a monolith of millstone grit, 8 feet 4 inches high, and measures 1 foot 4 inches by 1 foot 2 inches at the base, tapering to 11 inches square at trie top. This cross is the largest and most impor tant of the three, and is perfect, with the exception of the head, which has disappeared. The four sides are sculptured thus : \u2014 \u25a0 \" The North Side is divided into four panels by plain horizontal bands, \u00a7 Leland's Itinerary, 2nd ed., by Thomas Hearne, vol. i., p. 144. See also Plot's A'atural History of Staffordshire (16E6), p, 432, where the \" Danish pyramidal stones '' at Leek, Draycott, Chebsey, and Checkley, are described. \u2666 Jour. Brit. Arch. Assoc, vol. xx., p. 310. t Rivers, Mountains, and Sea-Coast of Yorkshire, by J. Phillips, 2nd ed., 1855, Pl. 17."], [50, "46 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 1)2 inch wide,, and.\" a roll moulding runs up the four corners of the stone. The top and bottom panels are 2 sect high,, and the two middle panels 1 foot 9 inches high. The panels contain three-quarter length draped figures, each holding a book in the hand. The bodies are those of human beings, but the heads are those of the man, bird, and beasts, which symbolise the four Evangelists, in every case surrounded by a nimbus. The figures are arranged in the following order, commencing from the bottom, viz. \u2014 1. St. Matthew (the Man); 2. St. Mark (the Lion) ; 3. St. Luke (the Bull) ; 4. St. John (the Eagle). This method of representing the Evangelists by composite figures, having human bodies and beasts' herds within a glory, does not appear to be common, although Miss Louisa Twining gives two other examples in her Symbols and Emblems of Early Christian and Medi\u00e6val Art;* one from an eighth century MS., in the Bodleian Library at Oxford; and another from the Bible of William Rufus, in the library of Winchester Cathedral. In the catacombs at Rome the Evangelists are symbolised by four scrolls. In later times the scrolls ore unfolded and held in the claws of the four beasts. \" The South Side is divided into four panels, exactly corresponding in height with those on the North side. The iop panel containsathree-quarters draped figure, holding a pastoral staff, with a crooked head, in the left hand, and having a glory round the head. This is probably intended to represent lhe Saviour. The three lower panels contain animal forms very much conventionalised, and with the different parts of their bodies twisied and interlaced in a variety of ways. The uppermost of these three panels has sculptured upon it two monsters, placed symmetrically facing each other, each biting his own tail, which is interlaced below with that of his neighbour. Neither of these monsters has any limbs or wings, and therefore they more resemble reptiles than animals. The next panel has upon it a winged beast, holding up one paw and sitting upon his tail, which is twisted in an S-shaped curve round the other leg. The bottom panel shows a beast standing on his hind legs with uplifted paw, and \"ith his tail twisted round under the belly, behind the back, and round the neck. \" The meaning of the animal forms, which are of such constant occurrence upon Christian monuments of the type, we are now dealing with, has yet to be explained. This can only be done by systematically arranging and classifying all the different kinds of conventional beasts, and comparing them with the illustrations given in the Bestiaires and other MSS. of the Middle Ages. Some dragonesque forms are ob- viously merely ornamental, and these are generally developed out of purely geometrical patterns, such as spirals and interlaced work. Others, again, either by their attidude or special peculiarities of appearance, are intended to symbolise something. When represented, as at Ilkley, below the figure of the. Saviour, it may be intended to indicate the triumph of Christ over the brute creation. In support of this view we have upon the Ruthwell Cross in Dumfriesshire the figure of our Lord \" Pp. 94 and 106."], [51, "SAXON TIMES. 47 trampling upon two swine, and with an inscription taken from the apoc ryphal Gospel of the Nativity, which reads, ih's xp's ivdex aequitatis SERTO SALVATOREM MVNDI EESl'IAE ET DRACONES COGXOVERVNT IN deserto \u2014 ' Jesus Christ the Judge of Righteousness ; beasts and dragons knew the Saviour of the world in the desert, and came and worshipped Him.'* Again, in Westwood's Miniatures of /risk Arl,\\ is illustrated an ivory diptych of the eighth or ninth century, belonging to the Church of St. Martin Genoels in Belguim, which has carved upon it the Saviour trampling on the lion and dragon, and inscribed + ubi d'ns ambulavit super aspidem et basilicum conculcab't leone' et draconem. On the Ilkley crosses, the beast with unlisted paw occurs three times in the case of a single animal, and- twice in the case of pairs of animals. The Rev. G. F. Browne considers that this is intended to indicate an attitude of submission. It appears to me that it might equally stand for one of defiance. \" The East Side is not arranged in panels. At the base are two right and left-handed spirals, of three twists each, which may either be simply geometrical ornaments or the tails of serpents ; it is difficult to sav which, on account of the weathering of the stone. Above the upper spiral is a straight stem with waved branches on each side, gradually developing into elegant conventional foliage, which fills up the remain der of the shaft, curving round into'graceful scrolls, and terminating in bunches of fruit and leaves. \" The West Side resembles the East in general design. At the base are two dragonesque animals with interlaced tails ; and above, foliage similar to that on the East side. Two of the triangular spaces, formed between the spiral curves of the foliage, and the straight edge of the stone, are silled in with the symbolical three-cornered knot, known as the triquetra [probably symbolic of the Trinity.] \" The Eastern Cross has suffered most shameful ill treatment, having been used for many years as a gatepost in the churchyard wall, the leaded holes for hanging the gate being still visible. The dimensions of the mutilated shaft, which is all that now remains of what must have once been a most exquisitely beautiful cross, are as follows : \u2014 height, 5 feet 5 inches ; size at base, 1 foot by 1 foot 1 inch, tapering to 9J- inches square at the top. The stone of which the shaft is composed is mill stone grit. The carving is much more delicate than that on the other crosses, and both the design and workmanship are of the highest excel lence, which makes it all the greater pity that it has been so wilfully defaced. The angles of the stone are ornamented with a cable mould ing, and the four sides are sculptured thus : \u2014 \" The North Side, with the exception of the bottom 15 inches, which remains intact, has been entirely cut away to a depth of 2 inches, when the stone was used as a gatepost, so as to allow the gate to swing freely. The carving which remains shows portions of two panels ; the lower one * Anderson's Scotland in earlv Christian Times, 2nd Series, p. 237. t 1'. 150."], [52, "48 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. containing a monster biting his tail, which is twisted spirally round his body ; and the upper one the base of a conventional tree. \" The South Side is much worn away at the top, and the remainder is divided by plain bands. \\)/_ inch wide, into four panels, averaging i foot high each.

The bottom panel con tains winged dragons in pairs on each side of the stem of a conventional tree, whose branches curve round their bodies.* \" The East and West Sides are ornamented with conventional scroll work foliage of great beauty.

The sculpture of the upper panel is much obliterated, but appears to have consisted of animal forms. The middle and bottom panels contain conventional beasts with twisted and interlaced tails. \" The East Side is divided into two panels by a horizontal band, 3 inches wide, ornamented with incised lines and dots. The upper panel is 2 feet 2 inches high, and the lower one, 2 feet 1 inch high ; the former containing a grotesque animal with knotted tail ; and the latter a human figure draped, and holding a book ; his hair is represented in a very conventional manner, having somewhat the appearance of a wig, curling down on each side of the head.

From the same record we learn that Believe was a berewic of the Archbishop of York, as a member ofthe extensive manor of Othelai, and, like the rest of the dependencies, mostly waste. We have thus a manor within a manor. The Archbishop held one part as a berewic of Otley, and Percy held another by conquest from Gamel. In Otley with its berewicks, Stubham, Middleton, Denton, Clifton Bicherton, Farnley, Timble, Ectone, Poole, Guiseley, Hawksworth, another Hawksworth, Baildon, Menston, Burley, Ilkley, there are on the whole to be taxed sixty carucates and six oxgangs, in which there may be thirty-five ploughs.

The Archbishop's share had belonged to the see almost a century and a half. King Athelstane gave the manor of Otley to Wulstan, who was Archbishop from 931, a.d. to 955, and this included the berewicks of Stubham, Middleton, and Ilkley, but we know nothing about their exact condition. There are two ploughs at work in the demesne at Otley, and in the whole manor with its berewicks there are nineteen bordars, men of some little dignity, and ten villanes, or men of no dignity, but still above the condition of mere serfs, and five sokemen who would now be called gentlemen-farmers, or at the least, stewards. These must have been distributed over the estate from Ilkley to Pool, and from Timble to Baildon, and were, no doubt, getting things put to rights very slowly after the terrible devastation the Conqueror made in Yorkshire, in 1069-70, when for nine years, Simeon says, (though possibly exaggerated,) \"there was not an inhabited village between York and Durham.\" The manor of Ilkley belonged now to William de Percy, who had clutched it away from Gamel, the Saxon Thane, with a good deal more when the Anglo-Saxons went to the wall. There were 300 acres of good land in the manor proper, mainly in grass, for the tenants had only needed two ploughs. The Church is standing, and the priest is in residence, but he must have had scant congregations, poor man, as the manor is waste, and so the handful which came to hear mass and homily would come from the berewicks. And there is one little hint in this dim old picture of our town and parish we must not miss. The manor of Ilkley is waste and worth nothing, but Addingham is worth the same as in' Edward's time, and in Asquith there are four men at work for Percy with two ploughs. May we not conclude, from this hint, that Ilkley was down in the Conqueror's black book as a stronghold of the Saxons, which had given him far more trouble than the harmless little places all about, and must be destroyed for that reason, root and branch. So in that bitter winter of 1069-70 the order was given, because of some stern stand Gamel and his men had made there in the Saxon rising, which brought on the devastation of Yorkshire, to waste the place utterly, and then they made such thorough work of it that after sixteen years not a man was to be found on the manor. Asquith also belonged now to Percy, and there he had been able to make some headway toward tilling the land, but nothing could be done, as yet, with his manor of Ilkley, the place was so utterly forlorn. Yet only a few years before it was worth twice as much as Addingham, whither, the people would still remember, Archbishop Wulfere had fled in 970 for shelter from the Danes. There were several Gamels, landholders, at that time, notably Gamel of Bradford, and Gamel, of Elland, who held under the Lacy family."], [61, "NORMAN TIMES. 53 From this time we have three distinct lines to follow \u2014 (i) Ilkley Manor, which passed by the families of Percy, Kyme, Heslarton, Plessyngton, and Meryng, to the Middeltons \u2014 (2) Middleton-with-Stub ham Manor, held by Patric de Westwick and Peter de Middelton, of the Percies, for one-fourth a knight's fee, which descended to the present owner, W. Middelton, Esq., and (3) Langber-with-Nesfield Manor, held by Robert de Plumpton for half a knight's fee of Robert de 3Percy, of which the Dukes of Devonshire have been lords in modern times. 1147, H. 2). \u2014 Sixty-two years come and go from the times we have touched in the Domesday 3Book, and then we come to the next record in which Ilkley has a name and a place. On the sixth day of January, 1 147, and on the first day of the new moon, the good safe day when all things planted get their finest chance to grow, as many still believe, William de Percy founded the Abbey of Salley, far up in Craven, for the love of God, as he tells us, and the salvation of his soul, and those of his wife and children, brothers, lords, of his father also, and mother, relatives and friends, and all the faithful departed. He had a steward named Robert (the Dapifer) who was also minded to help in the good work, and this Robert, by consent of his chief, gave two oxgangs of land in Ilkley to the same holy purpose. William confirms this grant from his steward in another charter which bears no date, but is counted fourth in the series, two bovates of land in Ilkley \u2014 the scribe contrives to spell the name ' Illelaya ' \u2014 with tofts and crofts, and the assarts to the same lands belonging. A second Robert, steward also, and son to the first, gives two bovates of land in Ilkley \u2014 it is ' Illeclat' this time \u2014 with two assarts and all appurtenances, for the health of his soul and those of his father and mother, and all his relatives ; yet this is probably not a new gift, but a confirmation of that made by his father. Then there is a charter of remarkable interest we will print in full, for it is too precious to cut down, and then find the links which bind all these together, and solve a problem Dr. Whitaker left unsolved touching the De Kymes. Roysa, wife of Simon de Kima, for the health of her soul, and those of her parents and relatives, in her widowhood, gives, grants and con firms to God and St. Mary and the Monks of Sallay, two bovates of land in Illeclay, with two crofts and the nearest tofts on her land, which she had of the gift of her father, to the South of the said vill, with all appurtenances within and without the vill, to hold of her and her heirs in pure and perpetual alms. She also grants to the same Monks and to the men remaining on those lands to grind their grain at her mill at Ilkley to the 20th measure ; and if it should happen that by a flood or by any deficiency of water they may not be able to grind at the said mill, then they may grind wherever they will without molestation or exaction by her or hers. Moreover, she confirms to the same Monks all the lands they have of the gift of her father, and Traneker, which they have of the gift of Simon de Kyma, her spouse, in the said vill, as the Charters, the Monks have, witness."], [62, "54 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. Witnesses : \u2014 Philip de Kyma, my son and heir ; Thos. de Multon, and Lambert, his son ; Simon Dribi, and others.* The following is the Dapifer pedigree : \u2014 Reinfrid, a soldier under the Conqueror in the Northern Campaign, became the first Prior of Whitby, though an illiterate man. He was accidently killed in 1083, and buried at Hackness. (Simeon of Durham). Fulco, his son, a benefactor to Whitby Abbey, held various lands under Alan, son of William de Percy, including some at Ilkeley and Newton- Kyme. He died before 1 1 25. Robert, his son, succeeded to Fulk's land and office of dapiferf to the Percies. Robert had two brothers, William and Gilbert. Robert married Adelisa, d and h. of Herbert de St. Quintin, by Agnes, sister and h. of Anselm de Stutevill. Robert, son of Robert Dapifer, married Rohesia, Countess of Lincoln, They had two daughters, Margaret and Roysa, who married brothers, William and Simon De Kyme. Roysa married Simon, son of Philip de Kyme, and had a son, Philip de Kyme, the father of William de Kyme, who married Matilda, d. of Wm. Ferrers, Earl of Derby, and heiress of the Earl of Pembroke. Lucy de Kyme, heiress of her brother William, married Robert de Umfravill. So Robert Dapifer is an interesting figure as the first person we can hear of in Ilkley, who ever gave anything away, and we must know him and his line. He was the son of Fulk Seneschal to Alan de Percy, and had a son, Robert, who succeeded him as steward to the Percies, lords of Ilkley. This second Robert joined with his mother in founding the priory of Nun Appleton, to the memory of his father, and for the repose of his soul. Then he made a good match so far as money went, for he married Roesia, the widow of Gilbert, Earl of Lincoln, and niece of Ranulph, Earl of Chester. Ranulph had taken Gilbert prisoner at the battle of Lincoln in 1142, and as he was a bachelor and very rich, rough old Ranulph made it the prime condition of being released from the iron fetters that he should be bound by the silken, for he was a very pretty prize. Robert had two daughters by this marriage, Margaret, who in her turn married William de Kyme, and Roysa who married Simon de Kyme, son of Philip, by Hawise, d. and h. of Ralph Fitzwith. Margaret died in the year 1220, and then Roesia, who was left a widow in the same year, came into the estate of the Dapifers in Ilkley, and confirmed the grant of land made by her grandfather to the Monks of Salley. She was a woman of spirit and purpose. There were other lands to the South in Elkington and Calthorpe which had also come to her through her sister Margaret, and these the bereaved widower would fain have kept, feeling, no doubt, it was too bad to loose both wife and lands. Roesia, it may * Historical account of Salley Abbey. Pp. 6 and n. t Dapifer\u2014 Carrying the dapes, dishes or viands, an honourable office, eventually a sinecure."], [63, "NORMAN TIMES. 55 be, felt it was equally hard to loose lands and sister, so she gave the king, Henry III, a palfrey, and then he summoned 'William de Kyme before the justices at Westminster to show cause why he did not do justly by the woman. This was all done in 1220, and in that year her husband died, but she lived long in the land enjoying her possessions at Ilkley and Appleton-by-York ; and it was in her widowhood she made the deed in which she manages to tell us these curious and capital things about our town. The two oxgangs* of land \u2014 36 acres perhaps \u2014 each with its homestead, croft and toft, lay on the South side of the village. It was, in truth, part of the estate owned or farmed in modern times by the Bollings and Listers, but it is evident the village does not then reach so far. There is a mill on the land with a water wheel attached, which in 1220 was subject to exactly the same trouble old men remember in 1840 or 1850, for when great rains had fallen and the dark brown waters came rushing down from the hills, and pouring over the dam, the miller could not grind your corn, and in a long drought he could not grind it because the great spring of itself could not keep such a wheel going all day long, so you must go elsewhere, or take perhaps to the old handmills which had not then gone quite out of use, if we may trust the evidence found within the castle at Knaresborough. This was the way the De Kymes got hold of the presentation to the church at Ilkley, as we find them about twenty years after, when the Archbishop's Registers begin. They present down to 13 14, and then as the Dapifers are lost in their family, so they are lost in that of Umphra ville, Earl of Angus, who married the heiress of the house of De Kyme, and Gilbert ofthe Angus family presents to the living in 1363.! Philip, Lord of Kyme, died in 1322, having borne at the siege of Caerlaverock \u2014 \"red with a cheveron of gold surrounded by crosslets.\" \" Phellipe le Seigneur de Kyme Ky portoit rouge o un cheveron De Or croissillie tot environ.\" Cbe iperdes, 1085-1376. We have given the Dapifers and De Kymes the first place in the history of Ilkley after the Conquest, because the first rays of light that shine on the place after Domesday are given forth from their lamp. We must now take up the story of the Percies, who helped to make the for tunes of the Dapifers, and were lords of the manor by superior tenure. William de Percy, the first of the name in England, was held in great esteem by the Conqueror, who gave him more than 100 manors in York shire alone, and many more outside. It is said he was not present at the great battle on which the destiny of England was to turn ; but came over during the next year, and did eminent service in helping to hold what the new king had so far won. It is said also that he was a young man then, * Octo bovat\u00e6 terr\u00e6 faciunt carucatam, octo carucat\u00e6 faciunt unum feodum Militis : 14 carucates make a knight's fee in Ilkley. t Descent ofthe Earls of Lincoln. Nichols' Topographer and Genealogist. Vol. 1, p. 304."], [64, "56 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. and was distinguished from the bare-faced Norman adventurers all about him by the nickname of Alsgernons, because he insisted on wearing his whiskers. He had a son William, who was father of Richard, and Richard, again, was father of William, the third of that name, who was the secu lar force in founding Salley, and made good the gift of those oxgangs of land the Dapifers gave the monks on the South side of the hill, and the Abbot, to make all sure, had their gift confirmed in 1154 by two Charters duly set forth in Dodsworth's MSS., one from the king, Stephen, and one from Archbishop Roger, of York. The main line of the Percies is as follows :\u2014 William de Percy, said to have been descended from Geoffrey Fitz Mainfred, a Danish chieftain, and soldier under Rollo, 912, followed the Conqueror in 1067. He married Emma de Port, daughter of Hugh de Port, Hampshire, and engaging with Duke Robert in the first Crusade, 1096, died near Jerusalem. Alan de Percy, his son, second lord. William de Percy, son of Alan, had no sons. Agnes, his daughter, married Josceline de Lorain, brother of Henry the First's queen, who assumed the name of Percy. Their sons were Henry and Richard. Henry was the father of William de Percy (died 1245), the father of Henry (died 1272), the father of Henry (died 13 15), the father of Henry (died 1351), the father of Henry who fought at Crecy, 1346, the father of two noted sons \u2014 Henry, Earl of Northumberland, and Thomas, Earl of Worcester. The former was father of Sir Henry (Hotspur), the father of Henry, second Earl of Northumberland, who fell at St. Albans, 1455, the father of Henry, third Earl, who fell at Towton, 1461, the father of Henry Percy, KG., who enforced the tax laid by Henry VII., and was murdered by the populace at his house near Thirsk, 1489. His son, Henry Algernon, fifth Earl, KG., was father of Henry Algernon, who died without issue in 1537. The last-named had a brother, Sir Thomas, executed for Aske's Conspiracy, who was father of Thomas and Henry, successively Earls of Northumberland. The former was executed at York, in 1572, for conspiracy, and the honours, under a reversionary clause, were transferred to his brother Henry. But for this attainder, it is said that Alan, son of Josceline Percy,* of Beverley, would have become Earl. This Alan died s.p., 1692 ; his brother Charles died soon after the Restoration; and their sister, Eleanor, was wife of William Ferrand, Esq., of West Hall, Nessfield. The Earldom was held, 1585 \u2014 1632, by Henry, son of the last-named Henry, and he was succeeded by his son Algernon, and he by his son, Josceline ; who left an only child, Elizabeth, the mother of Algernon Seymour, Baron Percy, whose daughter and heiress married Sir Hugh Smithson, who assumed the * The sth Earl had a brother, Josceline Percy, Esq., of Beverley, father of Edward, father of Alan, father of this Josceline, and of Edward Percy, of Sussex, Esq.

A great-grandson of the Duke married, in 1839, the eldest daughter of Bishop Heber. In addition to this main line, and its several important offshoots, there were in Yorkshire descendants of three brothers of \" Whiskered \" Percy. These brothers were Arnald, Serlo, and Picot of Bolton Percy. We consequently meet with several of the name whose connection with the main line has not been shown, as, Adam, a Black Friar, 1300 ; Sir Henry, died about 1350 ; Walter de Percy, Knt., and Henry his brother, who witnesses a Cowthorpe deed for Nigel de Plumpton. The first Alan had three brothers, Walter, William, and Richard, and it seems that Ilkley was held by this second William. Peter Percy was M.P. for Scarborough, temp. Edw. III., and the family lived there down to the Reformation. The Percy Badge \u2014 the well-known Crescent and Fetter-lock \u2014 was probably adopted by a Percy who had captured a Saracen banner during the Crusades. In the whole range of English genealogy, not more than two or three families can rival the Percy's pedigree. were also great people, Phillip of that name refused to render suit and service for his land and tenement in Ilkley, fifteen years after we part with Rohesia, who gave the king a palfrey, and, in 1235, the Wil liam de Percy who was then lord, summoned The Percies appear to have left the Manor very much in the hands of the De Kymes, and as they the said Phillip to answer in his Court at Spofforth, but with what result does not appear.* Sixteen years after this, in 1251, Peter de Percy finds it will be worth his time and money to look after the game on his land here, which had been reserved in the original grant for the king, so he gives 20 marks to Henry III. for free warren in all his royal domain at Ilkley, and can hunt henceforth in our parish to his heart's content. Two years after this he gets another grant from the king, in 1253, which we will print entire, as it is of a very curious interest. 37th Henry III.,York : \u2014 \"The king grants to Peter de Percy one market day, through the day of Wednesday, at his manor of Ilkley, in the County of York, and a fair at the same place to continue for eight days from the eve of St. Luke the Evangelist, and thereafter, except said markets and fairs be hurtful to those already held in the neighbourhood.\" t The last clause is added from the Middleton MSS., and the charter reveals the fact to us that Ilkley has been thriving to some purpose in the 164 years since the manor was reported waste, and Lord Peter wants to give the town rank and title, as well as to turn an honest penny, no doubt, in the shape of tolls on the beeves and butter. And we can see what a * Dodsworth, MSS. 152, Folio 14. t Dodsworth MSS. 120, folio 19. H."], [66, "58 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. good thing this will be for Ilkley if it can be done. It was wisely planned. The day for a market would anticipate that they were holding in Otley, and the third week in October for the fair would take the cream from the fair the Archbishop's men held down there on the third week in November. But for some reason the charter does not work. The usual clause about not hurting the markets and fairs in the neighbourhood may have blocked the wheels of the new enterprise, and his Grace of York may have availed himself of its insertion ; we may also make up our minds that the folk on the land would demur. Why should they go to Ilkley when they had gone to Otley ever since the days of Athel stan the king ? and how long before no man knows. It might be for their interest, but liking may sometimes be more than interest even in Ilkley and Yorkshire, no one knows that better than a native. Let the reason lie where it may, we hear no word after this of a market or fair for Ilkley, the enterprize was still-born, but the ancient charter may still be worth the attention of the town when the time comes for a renewal of the fine old adventure. Seven years after this charter was granted for a market and fair, in 1260, we find the De Kymes have really got the upper hand of the Percies, for Peter de Percy now holds one carucate of land in Thornton and Ilkley from William de Kyme in free dower of marriage.* Twenty-four years after this we find by Kirkby's Inquest, made in 1284-5, A-D-> tnat Robert de Percy holds Ilkley for three carucates from Philip de Kyme, and Philip from the heirs of Henry de Percy, and Henry held for military service, at the fourth part of a knight's fee, but Henry de Percy must give three shillings each year to the Wapontake of Skyrack. A second entry in the same Inquest, to which Walter de Hawksworth, Walter de Middleton, and others were sworn on the Sacra ments, enlarges the first record and throws a gleam of light on the relation of the two great families.

In 1303, the inquest held touching the knight's fees in Yorkshire reports that in Ilkley there are three carucates of land, where 14 make a knight's fee, of which Robert de Percy holds one-and-a-half, the Abbot of Fountains from the Abbot of Salley a half, the Rector of the church of the same town (William de Askeby,) a half ; the Abbot of Salley holds a half and has a brief, and the Abbot of Fountains holds a half and has a brief. We shall trace the Percy lordship in Middleton and Nessfield when we come to these sections of our story, and pass on now to a document which brings down their connection with Ilkley to 135 1, and has a bad look and taste to it, turn it which way you will. 24th Edward III., York. \u2014 Sworn witnesses testify : That Walter de Heslarton held the manor of Wilton-in-Pickeringlithe from John de Heslarton, Knight, his father, and in his own right from the king, as one knight's fee. The said Walter died on the 24th of August in the 23rd year of the present king, AValter his son being under age. They say, also, that Eustathia, who was the wifeof the aforesaid Walter, senior, and daughter and heir of Peter de Percy, held in her own right the manors of Sutton-on-Derwent, Ilkley, &c, and this Eustathia was an idiot from her birth, and Thomas Ucthred, Knight, Martin Skerne, and Walter Cates, held the manors and tenements named, which belonged to the said Eustathia at the time when her husband died, and until her own death, which took place after the lapse of about a year.* So Walter survives through this account as one who did not mind even the caution of the Northern farmer : \u2014 \" Dunnot wed for money, But goa where money is.\" He married a woman who was \"an idiot from her birth,\" for no reason in the world, as we must conclude, but her possessions, which were most ample and seductive. The boy he left was still an infant, as we may infer from an application made to the king 18 years later for a marriage dower, he being then still under age. So this was soon over which was so ill begun, the match of the young knight of standing with an idiot, and the farce ended in a tragedy, for it is stated in the later document of the marriage dower that he died in the year of the pestilence. They give this year as 1350, from which we gather that the black scourge was still hanging over ihe land, and that the poor knight died of it, probably in the dog-days of that summer, while his wife followed him within a year, and who shall say the fond heart was not broken by the woe of it, and the desolation. Here is one more paper readers must interpret as they have insight and learning, and then we may leave the Percies for a space, and take up the Middletons. * Dodsworth MSS. 120, folio 94."], [68, "60 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 49th Edward III., 1376. \u2014 Between Simon de Haslarton, Knight, and Catharine his wife, and Robert de Bukton, Capellanum, deforc.

The aforesaid Robert granted to Symon, and to his wife, the Manor of Wilton, to be held by him and his male heirs ; and if he dies without off-spring the Manor will go to Sir John Hothum, of Scarburg, and his male heirs. And if Sir John dies without issue, the Manor will go to John Driffield, of London, and his male heirs. The Manor of Ilkley will remain, after the death of said Symon, to Sir John Hothum. The Manors which Euphemia held till her death, from Robert de Brigham, and which, after her death, ought to have reverted to the aforesaid Robert de Buxton (Bukton) and to his heirs, may, after her death remain in entire possession of said Symon ; and if he die without issue, go to Sir John Hothum, with the rest of the property recorded above. The Heslartons had got hold of this valuable property, with much more, the reader will remember, through the marriage of Walter Hes larton with Eustathia, daughter and heiress of Peter de Percy. Walter died in the third year of the Black Death ; his wife followed him very soon, and they left one son, an infant who grew up to manhood, and in 1368 was looking to his lord, the king, for guardianship, and a marriage dower. When we find the lordship mentioned again, it is in the hands of the Plessingtons of Plessington, in Lancashire ; who, in 1420, merely held a messuage in our town; but, in 1452, held the Manor, as we gather from this document. Will of Henry Plessington, Knight : \u2014 I bequeath to John Plessington, my bastard, V marks. I will that my Manor of Ilkley be sold at the discretion of William Anderby. Proved Sept. 13, 1452.* Mr. Anderby did not sell the manor, but left it, we presume, in the hands of the widow, as we find that in 1458 she grants the office of steward of the manor of Ilkley to Thomas Clapham, Esq., of Beamsley, with an annuity of 40s. during his life. Isabel and her husband, John Francys, Sept. 3, 1461, conveyed the Manor in fee to Robert Roos for behoof of William Middleton and Margaret Plessington. Then Robert Roos granted the manor to Thomas Harper, the Vicar of Ilkley, who came to us in 1473, ar>d ne turned it over, some say on June 16, 1483, and others say on November 14, 1497, to Nicholas and Richard, the bright and able sons of Sir William Middleton, whose story will be found in the \" Middleton \" chapter. On the 28th of April, 1500, the brothers agreed to divide the manor lands and tenements between them equally, with these exceptions : that Nicholas should be allowed a certain sum wherewith to find a priest to pray for their father's soul, their mother's soul, and other Christian souls, in the parish church of Ilkley, for ever. Nicholas was also to have, over and above his half, the lands and tenements then occupied ' Nichols' Testa menta Vetusta."], [69, "NORMAN TIMES. 61 by Constantine Steyd, and three closes called the \" short closes,\" and a parcel of land called \" ye spryng,\" and John Walker's farm called \" Hungrehyll,\" and certain lands in Wheatley, all these going to the finding of the priest, and if Richard Middleton should fail to have law ful children, then the whole manor should go to the heirs of Nicholas. Our readers will find that Nicholas Middleton had a daughter, Emma, who married Thomas Thwaits, of Denton, a widower of a ripe age. She inherited her father's share of the Ilkley estates, and, being left a widow, if we read the rather perplexing story aright, married Thomas Meryng, of Meryng and Newark, Notts., (Memorials of Fountains, 323.) for her second husband, and bare him a son, Francis Meryng, who sold the Manor to John Middleton, then, or soon after, the head of the Stubham family ; and the deed of sale bears date, April 16, 1552. Eleven years after this, in 1563, Henry Soothill \u2014 son of Elizabeth, the daughter of Nicholas Middleton by his second marriage \u2014 released certain rights in the Manor that had come to him either through his mother or his uncle Richard. This was about 320 years ago, and since then the Manor rights have been steadily held, so far as we know, by the main stem of the family, subject to such disputes as that which arose over the Holling Hall estates, and to such perils as that which came with the Commonwealth in Cromwell's time ; and when the head of the house, with his brother, and perhaps a son also, took sides with the Cavaliers."], [70, "62 PEDIGREE OF HENRY DE PLESYNGTON HENRY DE PLESYNGTON.

Social Gonoftfon. Scotch invasion. Macs? 2>eatb. poll vlas. E will devote this chapter to a brief survey of our Parish, and the condition of our people at the close of the thirteenth, and the opening of the fourteenth century, so far as this may be attempted from such data as we can lay our hands on ; re- minding our readers that the story we have tried to draw from the papers of these ancient families, reaches back to the first Percy Charter to Sallay, and forward to the death of the hapless young knight who married the heiress \u2014 and idiot \u2014 of the Percies, and slipped off the mortal coil in the last days of the Black Death. It is evident, from the deeds themselves, that our Parish had taken about the shape it still maintains, while the fourteenth century was still in its teens, and probable that it had risen to a rustic splendour we could not have found in the same years of the last century, when Dr. Richard son speaks of the mother town as equally dirty and insignificant, and of the parish as barred up by trackless wastes and untraversable ways, excepting the road from York to Kendal, which lay then on the North side of the river. At this early date, 600 years ago, the townships had been established, and the present hamlets were also in existence. We find Ilkley, Middleton, Stubham, Nessfield, Langbar, and Moorhouses, Austby, and Wheatley, with Tadthorpe and Stead ; and beside these \u2014 SkalawTa, which appears so often in the oldest deeds, and has vanished now, but must have been a place of some note then, as we find one man living there who bears the title of \"Clerk, * of Skalawra.\" The Percies and De Kymes had special interests in Ilkley. The Templars also, with Sallay, Fountains, and Bolton ; while the Rectory in the first taxation of Pope Nicholas, which belongs to this time, was worth not less than a year, if we adopt the very moderate rule of twenty to one as the difference between then and now in the value of money \u2014 a rule we shall carry quite through this chapter. Stubham was the residence of the * Not necessarily an Ecclesiastic, but one who had sufficient scholarship to gain \" the rights of the clergy,\" and thus be out of civil urisdiction."], [72, "'\u25a04 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. Middletons, and had been for five generations, when Thomas, afterwards High Sheriff, succeeded to the estates. They would have a home befit ting the wealth and dignity of the King's Reeve. Stubham, indeed, is a place of great dignity, standing in a park, when we find it in the records of the Manor Courts ; and this park remains, with a ring fence about it, as late as Speed's map of 1610. The Plumptons also had their Hall at Nessfield ; and so among them all \u2014 Percies, De Kymes, Middletons, and Plumptons \u2014 our Parish would thrive as it has never thriven perhaps since, until this century came, which was to witness such a revolution in its life and fortunes. We may catch little glimpses also of the condition of our artizans, farmers, and farm labourers, by the light reflected on these times from Bolton, with some help from another quarter. That poem in stone \u2014 Bolton Abbey \u2014 had risen by this time on the banks of Wharfe, and was taking its last touches of beauty and grace from the hands of Prior de Lande. The monks of Bolton have left us their day-book and ledger from 1290 to 1325, a.d. It contains as interesting a picture as one could wish for, not of their life alone,, but of the life all about them. They had land in Stubham, and Skalawra, and in Ilkley. 1298, Bolton Compotus : De Stubham & Scalewra, IXs. Id. De Rectore de Ilkeley in subsid' v. Scotiam, XXVIs. VHId.

It is possible Stead belonged to them, and the uplands on which Ben Rhydding stands, but of this we are not sure. They rented their dairy farms, as land is still rented in the United States, the landlord finding the cows ; while for each cow on the Rhydding farm the tenant paid them yearly four stones of cheese, and two stones of butter ; a rate, we imagine, farmers would be glad to find farms renting for now, while on the farm at Somerscales they abated half a stone even from these rates. They made enormous provision for their own servants also, in the shape of porridge, oat and brown bread, whangby and ewe milk cheese, salt fish, the rough cuts of beeves and swine, and brewed beer enough to swim in from their oats ; and so thick were the people on the land before the wasting of the Scots and the Black Death, which came a generation after, that they could call in 1,400 men on one day to cut their grain. They kept a jester also in those good old times, whose pranks and sayings would provide the whole country side with food for laughter on winter nights and harvest days, and at the mill and smithy, and circulate like the last good thing in Punch. They had a pack of hounds also, and hunted so furiously one day as to ruin a good horse, the property of a man in Addingham ; and there were wolves in the woods and on the moors any man might hunt, and if he could manage to bring in the head of the creature, they gave him a reward."], [73, "PLANTAGENET PERIOD. 65 The wages paid in those times do not come clear to us in the \"Compotus,\" because we cannot tell what meat went with the money, and what clothing. But a document called \" The King's Roll,\" which bears date 1281 \u2014 2 a.d., helps us here. It relates to the work done at Rhuddlan Castle, and may be taken for as fair an average as we can lay our hands on of the current wages, while their purchasing power may be found in the Bolton Ledger * Carpenters then had fourpence a day, and the foreman sixpence. Horse-shoers, fourpence ; smiths, fourpence, and their helpers, threepence ; masons, fourpence, and the foreman, six pence ; a master plumber, a shilling ; a charcoal burner, threepence or fourpence ; a plasterer, sixpence ; a turf-cutter, fivepence. Mowers had as high as sixpence a day, when the grass must be cut in haste, and spreaders had twopence. And as \" There's nae new guise that is not auld,\" the eye rests this instant on a note worth extracting, which has nothing to do with our present purpose, but may still be of interest to our readers. Dickens tells us how he adopted Boz from some child's play at names in the family, but here we find an entry of some aid given \" to Boz, being sick.\" A yearling steer then was worth ten shillings ; a cow, ten-and-sixpence to twelve shillings ; a sheep, two-and-twopence. Oats ran from one-and sixjjence to two shillings a quarter, and wheat from four to five shillings, while new milk was a half-penny a gallon, cheese fivepence a stone of 1 6 pounds, and butter eightpence a stone or a halfpenny a pound, if we are correct in our statement of the pounds to a stone weight. If I had been a journeyman smith, or mason, or carj^enter in those times, my wages would have been 6s. 8d. a day in our present money. A day and a quarter would buy me a stone of cheese, two days a stone of butter, six days a quarter of the best oats in the market, and four-and-a-half a quarter not so good. A week's work with half a day over would buy me a sheer), when the wool was fetching the highest price ever heard of in England. Thirty days and a-half would buy a cow, thirty-six days the best cow, and one day eight gallons of new milk. But if I wanted a pound of sugar I must work three days for that, and pay about tenpence a pound (present money) for rice, and give three day's work for a pound of figs or raisins, and a clear j^ound in our jiresent money for a pound of jjepjjer. It seems almost certain from such evidence as remains that the day-labourers on the land had a small place of their own on which they could keep a cow, and fowls, and a pig or two, or were still serfs fed and clothed by their lord. One such appears in the Bolton Compotus who saves up eighty pounds in our present money and buys himself (i.e. purchases his freedom) from the monks at about half the price they could get for a horse. Finally we can learn nothing about the price of ale either at Rhuddlan or Bolton, but in the Liber Albus we find that at this time in London a fair tap sold for three farthings a gallon, and what we should call XXX at a penny. So we may call those fairly good times for our folks in the shops * Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. 16, page 32, &c, I."], [74, "66 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. and on the land, rough enough, but plentiful for \" the milk-fed lads \" of the dales. That evil time when the Scots made havoc of us was draw ing near, but was not yet on us ; men were in demand, and well paid. There was a fine outlet for the surplus population also in the army and navy. The roll of Rhuddlan gives able sailors five shillings a day in our present money, common archers three-and-fourpence a day, and cross-bow men six-and-eightpence ; and His Majesty wanted men for his long enduring wars with the mighty thews and sinews and the true eye of the old Saxon breed, crossed by the Dane, we could so well supply. Our people were trained to the use of the bow ; the butts were standing for the practice of archery in our parish until guns came into use, and there will be much to say in a future chapter about their steadfast determination to have green yew for their bows out of their lord's woods, at any risk and any cost. The \" good times \" came to an end with the battle of Bannockburn, which was fought on the 24th of June, 1314, and ended in such a defeat as England had not endured since the Conquest. The result of this great disaster was very soon felt in the Northern dales, for the Scots came trooping over the border in great force and paid us back in our own coin for the injuries we had inflicted on them in times gone by. In the summer of 1316 they burnt Northallerton, Boroughbridge, Knaresborough, and Skipton, and made such havoc in Archbishop Melton's Manor of Otley, that he cursed them with bell, book, and candle. They held Ripon at a ransom of a thousand pounds \u2014 a price which must have taken the last crown out of the town, even if the citizens were not obliged to ask Bruce to take part payment in spurs. The invaders wintered (1316-17) in Pannel, and had the evil manners to burn the pretty place when they went away in the spring. A detatch ment wintered also at the great Abbey of Fountains, and ate up all the substance they could find. They came to Bolton during the summer of 1316, burnt some ofthe granges belonging to the monks, and among the rest \u2014 Stead. They did not burn the Abbeys, and the sole damage done to the buildings at Bolton lay in breaking down the aqueduct the monks had made to bring water into their kitchen. But they \"lifted\" the cattle on the home farms, ate up the grain, drank the wine and beer, drew the fish pond clean of fish, and made such havoc on the whole sub stance of the monastery and its tenants far and wide, that the record for 1319, a.d., is set down in one line \u2014 \"No account this year because of the Scots.\" Ilkley lay right in their way from Otley to Skipton, and shared in the common doom. We find from the returns we shall now print, that they had taken one clear third of what we were worth in the first invasion. They came again three or four years after, and went over about the same ground. We have no returns touching this final invasion, but may be sure that if they got as far as Ilkley in 1322, the caterpillar would eat what the locust had left."], [75, "67 PLANTAGENET PERIOD. His Majesty, Edward the Second, was in sore need of money, as usual, and the Scots had no sooner gone home after the first invasion than a message was sent to the Archbishop, bidding him find out what the church livings were worth, and the f>roperty of the church that was not counted in the livings. The King had still a right to a tithe of what was left, and must have it, so he ends his message with the words, \" You must forward these taxes, when they are fully made up, to our treasury, and that without delay.\" The Archbishop lost no time in obeying the order. Laymen and clergy men were put in commission to find outthe present value ofthe livings, and what they could pay. There are two coriies of their rerjort in the Dods sworth MSS., and we shall print the first, because it contains a few things that are not in the second, giving the report of the Craven churches in full, because it will be of a genuine interest to Yorkshiremen generally. \" To the Lord of the Treasury and Barons of the Revenue of our Lord the King, William, by the divine favor and will of God, Archbishop of York and Primate of England, health, with benediction, grace, and favor of our Saviour. \" The Decree of our Lord, the King, which I have received, I hereby return to you, coupled with the following : \" By virtue of this Decree, it is rjermitted to take cognizance of the whole of our diocese, but only in regard to ecclesiastical matters and the temporals annexed to the spiritual in the Archdeaconries of York and Cleveland, the franchises of Ripon, and the spiritual benefices of Allertonshire, wasted and desolated by the hostile incursions of the Scots, enemies and rebels to this kingdom, and in regard to what they have been accustomed to be taxed for tithes, to the best of their ability in these days, according to the value, form, and interest of the King's Decree, &c.

It reduces the worth of the Ilkley living from pounds to marks, and, by consequence, the worth of the whole parish. We have not extracted the report cf the Cleveland Churches, as that would be aside from our purpose of showing where the claymore and torch did their work in our own region. It is evident the invaders edged away from Leeds and Kirkstall, but had some special spite against Calverley-on-the-Aire and Weston-on-the-Wharfe ; took the forest road from Knaresborough, and struck Fewston on their way to Skipton, put out a claw towards Adel, but spared the tiny Norman Church, while their most ruthless work West of Knaresborough lay along the line of their march up Wharfedale. They wasted our lands, burnt our farmsteads, and ruined our farmers, as the Bolton Compotus shows us by little glimpses : the farmstead and fortunes of \"Ade the prophet \" among the rest. His gift, poor fellow, did not serve him to get out of their way in time with corn and cattle, and the kindly monks have to set him on his feet again when all is over. These calamities were followed by a devouring disaster, which would make the invasions of the Scots seem like a light affliction, for in the year 1348 the Black Death came on us \u2014 the most fearful plague England ever saw. The Registers preserved in York show that more than half the parish priests in our county died of this Black Death, while this fact has been taken as fair ground for the surmise that the poorer classes would suffer in a far heavier proportion than these favoured sons of heaven. There is a break here between the Ilkley lists of rectors and vicars, so that we cannot tell whether our priest survived, but we can detect the plague in the region all about us through these registers, and so may be sure there would be no escape for Ilkley. The priest of Addingham died ; with the priests of Weston, Otley, Castleford, Calverley, Batley, and more beside than we can find room for. \" The cattle strayed through the corn and there were none lest to drive them ; the harvests ripened and rotted on the ground and none were lest to gather them.\" So say the Chronicles. The deeds from which we have to draw so much make no mention of the wide-spread woe, beyond the notice of one death, but it is perhaps the most pathetic testimony we can well imagine to the weight of the calamity that we can find no deeds belonging to these years when the plague was at its worst. The half-yearly meetings of the Wakefield and Halifax Courts were suspended on its account, and it would be no light affliction that could effect this suspension. About a generation after the date of the Black Death we come to a series of documents of the deepest possible interest \u2014 the Subsidy Rolls for the West Riding \u2014 bearing the date of Second Richard II. , or 1378. They are a part of the account the young king kept with his kingdom touching a poll tax the parliament had laid on the people, the second of a series of impositions, which resulted very soon after in a wide-spread revolt of the peasants and poor farmers, led by Wat Tyler, and inspired by John Ball."], [78, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 70 The parliament had granted a poll tax in 1377 of fourpence a head to be paid by every lay person in the kingdom, both male and female of the age of 14 and upwards, mendicants only ex cepted ; and the roll for this subsidy resulted in the payment of 131,040 groats for the whole County of York. It did not include church men and women who were taxed separately and under another rate, but the roll contains the returns they made also, from which we gather the fact that there were 3,271 persons belonging to the sacred orders in Yorkshire at this time, and these again did not include members of the four orders of begging friars, these being classed by a grim stroke of satire, we suppose, among the real mendicants. * It was no wonder that such a gross and unfair imposition should create a bitter wrath in the hearts of the poorer folk. The rich lords and able merchants paid no more than the poor day labourer, and not so much if they happened to have a smaller family over 14 and under 21. So when they voted the subsidy in the next year the discontent had grown to such a head that parliament had to alter the terms of the second poll tax. They made it bear a certain proportion to your means, from fourpence, the lowest sum they would take, up to ten marks, the sum paid by the Duke of Lancaster. They also counted the man and wife one instead of two, and gave two years more of grace to the youth, releasing all from payment who were under 16. In these Subsidy Rolls of the second taxation, the names are printed of those who have been taxed, together with their calling and condition in life, and this gives the lists their main value. The Directories of London or New York, printed this year, are not so complete, if we leave out the churchmen, as this Directory, if we may borrow the term, of the town and parish of Ilkley, 507 years old at this present writing. It is indeed a directory and income tax list rolled into one, and reaches back to 16, while the modern custom leaves us alone until we are 21. lpoll nas for Slkclag.t Isabella de Methelay, veoue, Dame de Esquier iijs. iiijd.

In Nessfield there were seventeen married couples, with seven males unmarried, eight if we include the knight, and eight unmarried females; and in Middleton, if we include Sir Nicholas, fourteen married, ten males and twelve females of the single sort, or about 160 people, all told, over 16 years of age. AVe find only one tavern in the whole parish 500 years ago, it is in Ilkley, is kept by Henry Spenser, and was most likely what is now the AA'heat Sheaf. In Ilkley, also, there was a tailor, a shoemaker, and two fullers or walkers of woollen cloth, and a marshall, or smith, who could not only shoe your horse, but horn dreadful drinks into his hapless stomach. If he was sick bleed him in the neck, tap him in the chest, and dock a couple of inches from the bone of his tail, searing the poor stump with a hot iron, and then, if it would not stop bleeding, clapping thereon a big handful of \" arran * web,\" which was sure to answer, for this was the veterinary practice in Ilkley down to the days of old Jackey Birch. In Nessfield there was a merchant, or shopkeeper, a shoemaker, and a wood turner, whose main business it would be to make wooden platters, trenchers, and drinking mugs. AA'e shall find that the latter trade lingered down to modern times. In Middleton we find a weaver of woollen cloth, another of linen (textrix), and a carpenter, and when we leave out the gentry, my lady Isabella in Ilkley, 'Squire Scarbro', in Nessfield, and Sir Nicholas Middleton, we find the working force in Ilkley pays 15 s. 6d. poll tax, Nessfield us. 2d., and Middleton 12s. 6d., so that the mother town stands first. AA'e can see in these lists the various homesteads and family histories. The Spensers indicate a link with the Dapifers ; the AA'alkers hold to their father's old calling ; John Pyntylwag has a fine son, AA'illiam; the Skalwras live at Schalwra; the shoemaker hails from Bayn bridge. The widows of Nigel and Jordan are near neighbours, but the former has a son, John Neleson, to comfort hei The Gythlays stand for the important family Keighley. AA'illiam, son of Nable, has lost his wife, but has a daughter Isabella. Old Dawe, or David, has left a widow Beatrix, two sons, John and Robert, a daughter Johanna, and possibly a married son Richard. Another family of Daws live at Nessfield, and Scarburghs and Arthingtons keep servants at their homes. Then we find that some families, evidently of common orgin, are to be found squandered, so early as this date, over most of the townships of the district. Spider's web."], [83, "chapter vi. \u2014 slM&weton-witb-Stubbain. IDDLETON and Stubham are mentioned in Domes- day Book, as we have seen in connexion with the Archbishop's Manor of Otley, but his Grace held a berewick only in each of these Saxon settlements, while the Lord of the Manor of Ilkley before the Conquest was Gamel, and after the Conquest, Lord Percy ; and when we hear about the manorial rights again, 200 years after the first record, the Percies hold them. AA'e hear of Middleton, however, about 40 years after Domesday, and find that Robert, son of Nicholas de Stuteville has the fee. But we hear no more of them after this, and just 101 years after the Conquest we find the Middletons there. They came to us from Braham, near Tad- caster, and it is evident the family held lands in the township from which they took their juresent name before the date of the oldest deed now in existence, because this document, more than 700 years old, does not relate to the purchase of the estates, but only to their transfer to a younger son. This is certain, as Hypolitus, the father, gave to St Peter's Hospital, York, \"sex bovatas terr\u00e6 in Midleton,\" and mentions his \"hall\" and \"lordshijj,\" which was confirmed by his daughter Flandrea, in 1224. This deed, with those that follow of a minor moment, are among the Dodsworth MSS., and the fine old antiquary takes pains to tell us they were taken from the archives of Sir Peter Middleton, of Stockeld, Knight, 12th Dec., 1637. I. \u2014 Deed of Henry, son of Apolitus de Braham, 13 Henry 1 1., 1167, A.D. : \u2014 Let all present and to come know that I, Henry, son of Apolitus de Braham, have granted, and by this my present deed have confirmed, with assent and consent of my father, unto Hugo, son of Apolitus de Braham, for humblage and service rendered by him, four carucates of land, situate in Pholiphet,* and in Middleton, and in Stubb, to him and to his heirs, to be held from me and my heirs, in fee and inheritance. As the deed of my father attests for this confirmation, the aforesaid Hugo has given to me, and one binding Liard by way of recognition to these witnesses, viz : to AArilliam Trussbut, to Galfrid his son, to AA'illiam Capellanus, to John Dauile, &c. * Follifoot."], [84, "76 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. The note we have made that the Middletons lived in our parish before the date of this oldest document finds confirmation in the second we shall cite. II. \u2014 Unto all the faithful servants of Christ who are here and see this writing : \u2014 Robert, son of Hugo, son of Apolitus de Middleton, greeting. Be it known that I have given unto Robert, son of Bernard de Middleton, for homage and service by him rendered, one acre of land in Middleton. AVitnesses : Dom. Malgro Vavasore, Dom. Patrick de AA'estwick, and AA'alter Honley. This Robert is the first tenant of the Middletons whose name has come down to us, and as there is a certain pomp about the witnessing, we may presume he was a godson or j^oor kinsman of the third lord. This Sir Robert had one son, Sir Peter, who appears in the third deed here printed, and again as lord to a small holder whose father seems to have wandered over from the same green isle whence so many made their way to Stubham within human memory, or some nearer and forgotten Galway. III. \u2014 Let all present and future know : \u2014 That I, Peter, son of Robert de Middleton, have given to AA'illiam de Otley, son of AVilliam de Gale way, two acres of land on the plain of Middleton. Witnesses : Dom. Malgero Vavasore, of Denton, Knight ; Dom. Patrick de AVestwick, Knight ; Dom. Rodrigo Mounsell, of Burley, Knight ; and Nicholas Mounsell, of Burley. The next deed is obscure. The pedigrees mention only two sons of this first Sir Peter \u2014 Sir Adam and AA'illiam. But here are three who claim to be of the same lineage, they must either make room for, under the bar sinister if it must be so, or suppose there was another Peter we cannot place. De Burton may have married a sister of the future Sir Adam, and Robert was possibly their youngest brother. IV. \u2014 Let all present and to come know : \u2014 That I, Thomas de Burton, have granted to Ade, son of Peter de Middleton, and my brother, one messuage with croft, in Middleton. AA'itness : Robert, son of Peter de Middleton. These later deeds are all undated but Sir Peter was still alive when Kirkby's Inquest was made in 1284, a.d., and, together with Patrick de AA'estwick, held Middleton then for the fourth part of a knight's fee from the heirs of Percy. He must be remembered, also, for a very in teresting paper he left behind him, about a forlorn battle he sought in his time against the Knights Templars, who were now in the last times of their power and pride, and of course were easily able to drive one poor knight to the wall. It is a bond given by Peter de Middleton to the Knights Templars, now in possession of the Vicars Choral of York Minster : \u2014 To all the faithful in Christ who shall see or hear the present writing, Peter son of Robert de Middleton, eternal salvation in the Lord. A controversy having arisen respecting various contentions and offences violently committed against me by the Master and Brethem of the Order"], [85, "MIDDLETON-WITH-STUBHAM. 77 of the Temple in England, and by their tenants and men, it has been amicably settled. Inasmuch as I know that in part I have been guilty toward the house of the said order, I have sworn that as long as I live I, nor any one for me, shall presume to go against the said Master and Brethern, or their tenants and men, in any court, civil or canonical. And if it chance, which God forbid, that I should not observe this pledge, and as often as it can be proven by two trustworthy men, I bind myself for the satisfaction of the Master and Brethern to come and pay xxs. as a penalty without any clamour in a court of justice, toward the fabric of the Church of the Blessed St. Peter, at York. And I will and grant that if I fail in the payment of this penalty the Archbishop's officers may compel me as he may choose to observe all these things firmly and without fraud, renouncing all appeal, canonical or civil, which may be of advantage to me and against the said Brethern. And if their tenants offend against me let it be set right by means of writ before the said Brethern in their court at AA'hitkirk. In testimony of which I have set my seal. AVitnesses : Dom. AA'illiam de Boston, Chaplain ; Gilbert de Scalewra, and Thomas, his brother. It would not be easy to find a more fatal proof than this, among the side lights cast on them, of the insolent pride of the Templars. They had lands in our parish when the order was crushed out, and there had been bad blood and broken heads, no doubt, among the tenants, for if it is 'like master like man,' the Templar's tenants would be uneasy men to live with. But the Knight of Middleton must make all the amends. They have no objection to his saying that offences had been violently committed against him on their part, he can have no redress for this, but if such troubles arise again he must go to the court of the wolves at AA'hitkirk, and get himself duly devoured without complaint or appeal. AAre hardly need such pictures as Scott has painted of them when we light on a record like this, made by Peter de Middleton. Sir Peter had two sons, as we follow the pedigrees, Sir Adam and AA'illiam. Of AA'illiam we find only one slight trace in the MSS., and that is his signature to a deed by which Dom. Rodrigo Mounsell, of Burley, Knight, who witnessed the two acre deed just now, conveys his Manor of Burley to AA'alter Giffard, Archbishop of York. He did one thing, however, besides writing his name which makes him memorable in the annals of the family, he got himself married to Agnes, daughter of Sir Nigel Boteler, and had one son by this marriage, who became the second Sir Peter in due time, while Sir Adam lived and died, in what he must have taken to be, single blessedness. And so AA'illiam stands out alone during twenty generations, as a younger son, who is father of an heir to the estates of Middleton and Stubham, which, with this single exception, we believe, descend from elder to elder son, until the long line of male heirs ends with Marmaduke Middleton in 1757, who was of Sir Adam's mind and took no wife. But Sir Adam de Middleton makes a strong and true mark on the little world in which he lives and moves. AA'e actually possess a dim and"], [86, "78 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. sadly damaged likeness of him, if the effigy in our parish church, the fine recumbent figure in stone which in our boyhood lay in its proper bed in the ancient Middleton quire, with a large and leisurely look about it of resting, but now huddled away into a mere hole, was carven to his memory. He impresses one, through the record he made in his lifetime, as a man who had a good head on his shoulders, and in his (SLy/(jm/'- n/y/c? deytLy/ueJt/fr/t a/ J/iA/<w/. heart that love for land we notice in most men of a fine natural endow ment. We hear no word about him in the Inquest of 1284, A.D., and may conclude he was then under age, and as he is simply Adam de Middleton in the Bolton Compotus for 1306, a.d., where nine years later the Brethern call him f?J Dom. Adam, it is evident that in 1306, Sir Peter, his father, was still alive. But he is not the man to wait for dead men's shoes, he must be at work on his own account, and so in 1 304 we find him holding two carucates of land in Draughton from Lord William Vavasour, and in 131 2 he procures a grant of certain premises in Tadthorpe, near Wheatley, from Peter de Percy, so he enlarges the boundaries of the house of Middleton greatly, is the first man of the name we know of who passes the Western line of our parish, and as Sir Apolitus keeps close to the Roman road when he comes Westward from Braham, so Sir Adam hugs the same ancient line when he goes West ward to Draughton, revealing that deep-seated love for the old over the new, which is so strong in the heart of the family to this day. Sir Adam is forehanded also, and has money to lend even in those desperate times, when the king is eating the substance of England to the bone by his wars, and in 1299 lets the Monks of Bolton have ten pounds, on very poor security we fear, and some time after this lends the rector of our parish ten marks on his bond. He dresses also to his rank and station, and is not content to wear what can be woven from the wool of his own sheep, for in 1 306, when the Monks of Bolton go to the great"], [87, "MIDDLETON-WITH-STUEHAM. 79 fair at Boston, they bring back furs for him,* and eight years after a fine soft stuff, woven probably of camel's hair, so we can see him walking to church in these rare robes to hear mass, said by Rector Cotyngham, and some sort of sermon. But we imagine he did not make his home at Stubham in Sir Peter's time, when he was in our parish, for they did not agree very well as we make out from the family record, and in 1300 appear in a suit, in which Sir Adam is plaintiff, to settle the indenture of what is called the fine of the Manor of Middleton. In 1316 he held several lordships in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. In noticing the entry in the Bolton Compotus for 1315, a.d, \"For six quarters of malt sold to Peter de Middleton for the funeral of Lord Adam de Middleton, \u00a32 8s.,\" AA'hitaker says this fixes the date of the death of Sir Adam. But this may be doubted for two reasons: \u2014 (1) AA'hen the Nomina Villarum is taken in 1316, Sir Adam is still Lord of Middleton, and holds the lands also in Draughton. (2) If Peter de Middleton, who is presently to succeed his uncle and buys this malt from the monks, did not buy it until aster the elder lord's death, and it was then duiy brewed into ale, to be as duly drunk at the funeral, there would be very scant pleasure in the drinking of such stuff, fresh from the gyle-fat. The thing is not to be thought of. Dr. AA'hitaker is quite out of his reckoning. The heir did, no doubt, by Sir Adam's direction, what was still done in our dale and parish within our memory, when those who knew death was drawing near the house made due and timely provision by brewing the ale, pro viding the cheese, and even baking the spiced bread, so that the funeral feast might be served forth in a fitting way, and how the small boys, who were taken now and then to such funerals, did enjoy them fifty years ago, and hold them still among the pleasant memories of their childhood. In 1315, Sir Adam would be sick then and command this preparation to be made for his funeral, but in the next year he was still alive, nor do we know when he passed away. AA'e only know this, that they would speak of him as a man of far more than the ordinary force of character, the real person of our parish. Coming to further investigations, we find a totally different explanation at hand regarding Middelton and this heavy brewing. The entry in the Compotus reads : \u2014 \" 1315 De vi quart. brasei vend Pet. de Mydelton pro sepultura Dni Ad. de Mydelton, xlviiis.\" This beer, already brewed, was sold to Peter de Mydelton, jjossibly for the funeral of his kinsman, Dni Adam de Mydelton, who was Rector of Arncliffe for several years, and died just about this time. Be this as it may, Dr. AA'hitaker was scarcely justified in ascribing the effigy to Sir Adam, 13 15, on this entry alone, and Camden seems to have trusted tradition alone. A comparison of the workmanship with that of other effigies would fix the date for the first Sir Peter. * In 1305 he was appointed, with four others. Justice for the Northern Counties. In 1312 he had charge of the castle at Hull, and in 1313, when Justice of Assize, was sum moned to Parliament."], [88, "80 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. AVe meet with two eminent men at this time, who were possibly related to the Stubham family \u2014 Richard de Middelton, Justicier in 1262-9, and AA'illiam, Baron ofthe Exchequer in 1286. Sir Peter de Middelton, grandson of the first Sir Peter, was Justice Itinerant for Bedfordshire in 1330, Justice of the Forests in Yorkshire in 1334, and in the same year was High Sheriff of the County, and would see a good deal of the king, who was in the North as usual looking after the Scots. And then, there was a day in the year after, when he would look for the last time on the river, the fair green meadows, and the great shadowy woods, the moors with their splendid scarp of crags, the smoke curling above the thatch of the humble dwellings that nestled about the church, turn away from it all and die \u2014 a man still in his prime. He was buried in the church, probably was a man of a most genuine weight and influence, and of vast possessions, for the Post Mortem Inquisition says he died possessed of Stubham, Stockeld, Sicklinghall, Newsam-by- Spofford, and Ireby in Cumberland. Sir Peter Middelton, who died in 1336, was the father of five children, Thomas, who succeeded to the estates and much land beside ; Adam, John, Eleanor, who married Sir John Mauleverer, of Allerton, and Margaret, who married Sir John Vavasor, of AVeston. Sir Thomas married Eliza, daughter of Sir Robert Grammaray, of Bickerton-in-Bilton, and so the youth and maid would be neighbour's children when the Middletons resided a part of their time at Stockeld, as was their custom for many hundred years. AVe do not know in what year the young master of Middleton married, but as his son and heir, Sir Nicholas, was born in 1 348, we may presume he was about twenty-six when this came to pass. The pedigrees merely say he was living in 135 1-2, and there they leave him ; yet it is clear from the deed we shall now print he was living ten years later, and probably, from the subjoined memoranda, he was alive in 1369, but in 1378 he was dead, and Sir Nicholas was living then in Middleton, the head of the house. Dodsworth MSS., 37 Ed. III., 1362 : \u2014 Be it known that I, John, son of Isabella de Pickering have given to Sir Thomas de Middleton, Knight, my Manor of Habeton-in-Rydale, which I have held by deed of gift from Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Gower, of Faceby, Knight, formerly wife of Sir AVilliam Vavasor.

This is the last notice we can find of Sir Thomas ; he would then be fifty-three years of age, and his son and heir would be twenty-one. Sir Nicholas Middleton, son of Sir Thomas, was born in 1348, the blackest year of the Black Death, but this is all we can learn about him"], [89, "MIDDLETON-WITH-STURHAM. 81 until 1378, when he is thirty years of age, unmarried, and living at Stub ham. He was married three times, however, despite this touch of hesitation at the start \u2014 (1) to Matilda, daughter of Sir Robert de Veteri pont, (Oldbridge) (2) to Avice [Aniste de Stapilton], who bore him a son and heir, and (3) to Dame Isabel, widow of Sir Robert Plumpton \u2014 his third marriage taking place in 141 3, when he was 65 years old. There was some trouble with the Church about this third marriage, for Archbishop Bowet \u2014 that jolly old dignitary, who built a noble new kitchen to his manor house at Otley, and managed there and otherwheres to consume four-score tuns of claret every year \u2014 was moved to request Richard Pitts, his Vicar General, to inquire into a dispensa tion which had been granted to Sir Nicholas Middleton and Dame Isabel Plumpton, who wanted to marry, and were related in the third and fourth degrees. AA'e may note also that Sir Nicholas was one of the feoffees of the manor of Plumpton, under the will of this Sir Robert, who died on the 19th of April, 1407, and that the widow's jointure under this trust was only fifty marks a year, so that the old knight, it is evident, did not marry the lady for her money, and he was himself one of the richest men in the AA'est Riding. His name appears, in 1384, as a witness to the will of Sir Brian Stapilton, in which he was also a legatee \u2014 \" Item jeo devise a monsieur Nicholl de Medilton j nowche enveronne de peril], oue mon corne que j'ay solay porter pour le cuspell.\"* In 1386 he stands as a witness to a deed by which Richard, son of John Mason, of Draughton, gives Drystones and Risphill to Sir Peter Mauleverer, of Beamsley. He holds the manor court also at Stubham, at Martinmas, 1400, and again in the April following. In 1410 he was made Commissioner of Array for the AA'est Riding, for trouble was brewing as usual in Scotland, was still alive in 141 6, three years after his third marriage, and spending his halloween with dame Isabel, but in 1420 he was dead. Of Sir John Middleton, son of Sir Nicholas, we only know that he was living in 1420-1, married Alice, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Peter Mauleverer, of Beamsley, about that time, and had one son by this marriage \u2014 William, who took more kindly to Stockeld than to Stub ham, and spent the most of his life there. He married Margaret, daughter of Sir Stephen Hamerton, of Hamerton, and had five children by this marriage, (1) Sir John, (2) Nicholas, (3) Thomas, (4) Richard, and (5) Margaret ; a fine family we shall hear of again. AA'e find AA'illiam holding court in Stubham in 1442, and so we may conclude that his father, Sir John, was dead by this time, when the heir would have just attained his majority. He leases lands and tenements to three men, whose names are recorded at this court, and we find one Henry Hardwick among them, whose descendants still hold land on the estate after the lapse of these 440 years. \"AA'illiam Middelton swyer,\" * \"Item jeo devise a ma nece dame Aniste de Medilton j b.issyn rounde d'argent, ove un image de nostre Dame de al ibauster qui fust alankerer de Hampole.\" L."], [90, "82 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. occurs in a deed dated 1464, and in 1469, Dodsworth says he held lands in Ilkley and AA'heatley by feudal tenure, together with his son Richard, worth ,\u00a323 4s. On the 18th of June, 1474, he made his will, of which we give a translation : \u2014 \" AVilliam Midelton, of Stockeld, Esquire, To be buried in the Chapel of St. Ann, underneath the parish church of Spofforth.

And I will that after the decease of the said Robert, another Chaplain shall take upon himself this burden, and so on for ever. And I will that the reversion of my lordship in Ilkley shall be divided between my sons Nicholas and Richard, with remainder to Thomas my son. And I wish that one silver plated dish, one large brass vessel, and another large vessel of lead, and my two-wheeled carriage, and my best goblet be left in my house at Stockeld as hereditary property.

Nicholas, the second son, rose to eminence by force of a fine brain and a sterling personal worth, all men seem to have trusted. He was twice married, first to a lady whose name we do not find, by whom he had one daughter, Emma, who became the wife of Thomas Thwaites, a widower, and brother to the wife of Sir John. Emma Middleton was sole heiress of her father at the date of this marriage, and a fine match for Esquire Thwaites, as her father held estates in Ilkley, AA'heatley, Linton, and Deighton. But the slip came between the cup and the lip. Nicholas Middleton married Isabella Babthorpe for his second wife, when he was getting well on in years, and by this marriage had a daughter Elizabeth, to whom he gave his estate in Deighton. f AA'e may notice also that when Thomas Thwaites married the first time, his father gave him the estate of Denton, which he held henceforth, and to which no doubt he brought his second wife, and that Nicholas Middleton, her father, had a residence in Ilkley, though he usually lived at Deighton, and this is the only time, so far as we know, in which the Middletons are to be found living in Stubham, Denton, and Ilkley, or in which the lady of Denton had kin so near at Stubham, for they were of kin on both sides. \" * Testaments Fboracensia. Vol. III., p. 209. t Dodsworth MSS."], [91, "MlDDLETON-WIl H-STURHAM. 83 Nicholas Middleton was also much sought after, we may notice, as a trusty and loyal man of affairs. He was made administrator in 1483, under the will of AA'illiam Shirwood, an eminent merchant of York, and father to a Bishop of Durham of that name. In 1496 he was trustee of the manor of Plumpton with other gentlemen of mark, and in the same year we find Arthington of Arthington seeking his help most eagerly in some trouble he can by no means manage alone. In 1497 he stands as arbitrator again between a Squire Hastings and a gentle man of Lincolnshire, and in 1501 a Cadet of the house of Plumpton, born under the bar sinister, seeks him to pull some crooked matters straight and set him on his feet. So we may say this was a quiet, strong, and wise man, who could make the crooked straight, and number that which was wanting in those troubled times. Thomas Middleton, the third son, took to the Law, and it seems quite probable that he was \"reading for the bar\" in the Middle Temple in 1464 ; was certainly living in London then, and had newly come up there from Yorkshire, and on the 6th of November, two years later, he writes this very interesting letter from London to his future father-in-law : \u2014 \" Right AA'orshipful Sir, \" I recommend me to your good mastership, letting you wit, as touching the matter betwixt my Coussin Golfray Greene and Nyccall Gotman, that my Lord Chauncler has given in commandment unto Master Patman to make prossis against my Coussin Godfrey, to bring the issues and profits that he hath received of a Chauntre, for which the variance shold begin, and else to cours him from day to day : and therfore provide by your wisdome such remmede in his behalfe as you semes best.

London on his last visit to the old home, and sold them to his own content. He is mentioned in letters written from London some time after this, but in 1468 he came down again into Yorkshire to be married. His wife was Joan, eldest daughter of Sir AA'illiam Plumpton. The settlements bear date August 24, 8 Edward IV, and one thinks it must have been more purely a love match than was usual in those times, as the maid's fortune was only together with her outfit and wedding feast, while Sir AA'illiam settled estates in Brakenthwaite and Little Rib stain on the bridegroom that had come down from the great Sir Peter, and on September 1 2, a letter was sent from York to the Rector of Spofforth, empowering him to allow the wedding to be celebrated in the Chapel of the Holy Trinity, at Plumpton. Thomas Middleton continues busy and prominent in his calling after this for a good while, and, like his brother Nicholas, is greatly and widely trusted His father died, as we have seen, six years after this marriage, and on the 10th of November, in the year of Sir William's death, Peter, son and heir to Sir John, confirmed Middleton moorhouses and lands to his uncles, Nicholas, Thomas, and Richard. Thomas lies buried in the Church at Spofforth with this epitaph on a 'brass' to his memory \u2014 evidently home made \u2014 \"AA'ith humble prayer I beseech thee That this scripture shall here or see To say De Profundis if you letterd be For the soules of Jone my wife and me Thomas Middleton sometyme man of law Under this stone am laid full lowe If thou be unlearned and cannot reed For our soules and all Christen soules med Say a Pater Noster and Ave and a Creed.\" Richard, the fourth son of this most vital generation was Domicellus to Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and the curious reader, who strays away to London, can still find his domicile on the right as he goes up Holborn. He married Ellen Pickering, by a special licence issued to the Vicar of AA'ell, October 2nd, 1480 ; got, with Nicholas his brother, the manor of Ilkley, June, 1484, from Thomas Harper, Vicar, and others, who had lately acquired it from Robert Roos, Esq. In 1505 he grants certain premises in Ilkley for the use of Elizabeth, daughter of Bryan Sheffield, during her life, and his will bears the date May 24, 1521, so he survived Bosworth Field almost thirty-six years. AA'e have lingered over this strong and fine manhood of the Middleton and Hamerton lives, it may be to the hindrance and perplexity of our readers ; but the lives of these younger sons seemed to be a story well worth the telling, and now we will stay for a few generations by the heads of the ancient family for want of space to follow the minor branches. Sir Peter succeeded his father Sir John, and married Anne, daughter of Sir Henry Vavasour, of Hazlewood, who bare him one son, AA'illiam. The one little touch of romance in his brief and quiet life"], [93, "middleton-with-stubham. 85 lay in his riding forth with his Lord, the Earl of Northumberland, together with thirty-seven knights,* his companions in arms of the Percy fee, to meet the new king, Henry VII., in his progress toward York, and they met the king in Barnesdale, a little beyond Robyn Haddeston \u2014 \"a right noble company\" of knights, esquires and yeomen. He must have died in his prime, for the Letters of Administration to his estates, granted to Antony Seale, chaplain, bear date April 21, 1499. His son \u2014 Sir William \u2014 was of a stouter and more enduring strain. He was three times married, first to Jane, daughter of Lord Dudley, secondly to Isabella, daughter of Dighton of Stockeld, by special licence dated Nov. 13, 1508, permitting the marriage in the chapel at Stockeld, and thirdly to Joan 3Robinson ; and by the first two marriages he had ten children, of whom Elizabeth married the head of the house of Calverley, Margaret became wife of William Clapham, of Beamsley, and Jane married Marmaduke Vavasour, of Weston. In the Manor Court rolls, in Sir William's time, the traces of a careful and watchful landlord, who would have his penny's worth for his penny, and would let no man on the estate \" sluther \" down into mere pauperism if this could be prevented, or take more than the law would give him, or live so that his life would be a common nuisance. It is evident also that he was a man of the county rather than of Stubham and Stockeld, for he was made one of His Majesty's Commissioners in 1524, to collect the Subsidy set on foot to fight the French. Yet we do not find his name among those who made up the purse for Bluff Harry, and conclude that, with Gascoigne of Harewood, and other eminent persons, he passed the hat but put nothing in, or paid in some other method. But this did not damage his reputation, for in 1526 he was elected High Sheriff of his county, being the second man of his family who had attained to this eminence in 192 years. In 1542 he was present in the fight at Gallway Moss, and became host and hostage after the battle to the Laird of Drummetier, \"an ancient gentleman of or more,\" from over the border, who had the evil luck to be taken prisoner, and also \"surety for the brother of the Laird of Rosse and 100 men.\" In 1539 he stood his ground against his Grace of York, touching certain tythes, with what success we do not know, and finally, August 2, 1549, he made his will, which remained unproven until March nth, 1552-3, from which we may infer a long illness, or a new lease of life. \"August 2nd, 1549. \" William Middleton, of Stockeld, knight, giving his soul to God, and his body to be buried in our Lady quire in the Parish Church of Spofforth.

We venture, therefore, to question the tradition as it stands, and to give the statue to Sir Peter for these reasons : \u2014 1. \u2014 Sir William mentions it as the stone of Sir Piers. 2. \u2014 There is no inscription to the contrary. 3. \u2014 The Bolton Compotus, from which the tradition seems to have sprung, only mentions the \"brasei\" bought for the funeral of a Dom. \u2014 Adam, who was probably the ecclesiastic. [See p. 79.] 4. \u2014 Sir Adam died in the very dead-lock of the Scottish invasions, when the dale was laid waste, and the carving of monuments would be the very last thing men would think of. 5. \u2014 The workmanship and armour denotes a somewhat earlier date than 1 31 5. We have no hesitation, therefore, in putting this bar against the tradition, and venturing the opinion that the monument belongs to the first Sir Peter, and assume that the cross-legged knight bad done duty as a Crusader, having had pleasanter associations with Templary than the interview with the \"Whitkirk Wolves.\" Of Thomas Middleton, Sir William's eldest son, very little is known beyond what the pedigrees tell us, that he married Margaret, daughter of Sir William Gascoigne, of Gawthorpe, and that his wife bare him eleven children\u2014 six sons and five daughters. He held lands in Austby and Bergh, in the vill of Nesfield in 15 19, more than thirty years before his father's death, and is mentioned only as Thomas Myddelton, Esquire, of Stubham. In 1546 he held Ilkley tithes, West of the Wharfe. John Middleton, his eldest son, married Isabella Middleton, of Middleton Hall in Lonsdale, by whom he had five sons and two daughters. He bought the manor of Ilkley from Francis Meryng in the year of his grandfather's death, together with the Rectory and Parsonage, and in the next year, procured from Henry Soothill the remainder in fee that had come to 'Squire Soothill through the marriage of his ancestor with the daughter of that able and capital Nicholas Middleton, of Deighton, we were hearing of three pages back; and so this is his title to distinction that he made the manorial rights of the Middletons for the first time pass the river and include the mother town. In the same year he purchased Middleton Moorhouses from the Claphams of Beamsley, and so compacted the estate to the north ; a man of a saving grace evidently in this sense, and bent all his life on building up the fortunes of the family by working carefully from the centre of the lordship towards Burley and Addingham and the far line of the moors. William Middleton, his son, was twice married, and had three sons, Sir Peter by Mary Eltofts, of Farnhill, and John and William by Anne Townley, of Townley. His father was still alive in 1563, and busy as usual about his land, but in 1576, William was living at Stockeld"], [95, "MI DD LETON- W1TH-STUBH AM. 87 In 1585-6 he was in possession of the Stubham estates, and prosecuting certain claims against the Mauds, of Holling Hall, and others, for manorial rights on those estates, claimed in the purchase made by his father but resisted by the tenants in possession. There are two curious documents touching this question we shall print. Thomas Mahud and others of Holynghall pretend that they are a severall manor within themselves, holden not of the manor of Ilkley. The boundaries of the lordship of Ilkley stretch beyond Holling Hall and have been ridden from tyme to tyme like as they were this last somer, 27 Elizabeth, 1585, so if they have anie common they must have it as freeholders of the manor of Ilkley. The court rowles show that they have been called, 6 Edward IV, Henry VII., and since, every court, though we cannot prove amercia ments. Thomas Mahud and Robert Mahud, of York, his brother, freeholders, claimed the title to a house in the tenure of Barnard Hogg, against William Middleton, Esq., being built on the waste, 5th Elizabeth, as parcell of the possessions of the dissolved Priory of Hexham. To show that Holling Hall is subject to the manor of Ilkley, 9 Edward IV, James Osbaldiston is presented for cutting wood at Cogan, and 1 1 Edward IV., William Waide is presented for wrongful occupation of the Island near Holling Hall. This seems to be the substance of the claim advanced by Sir William, and the following is the tenants' plea. Peticon of Thomas Mahud, of Holling Hall, William Currer, of Marley, William Rogerson, of Holling Hall, and William Mawde, of Netherwoodhouse, to Sir Christopher Hatton, Knt., Lord Chancellor of England, reciting. That whereas Sir Godfrey Ffuliam, Knt., deceased, was seized of the manor of Holling Hall, and wastes and mores parcell thereof, did, in the eighth year of the past reign, convey the manor or lordship of Holling Hall to William Mawde, William Currer, aforesaid, William Rogerson, and William Waide, deceased ; and whereas, William Middleton, Esq., doth lay claim, being rich, and your orators poor men, we have olde witnesses who rid the boundaries, most of them being four score and ten and cannot travel far. The thing seems to have halted here and we cannot find the list of witnesses of four score and ten, but in 1590 we have a very interesting list of witnesses to an inquiry touching the Intake, or Ox Close, near Holling Hall, which must be of kin to the question of 1585. 22 Elizabeth, 1590.

Robert Hardwyk, Mydleton yeoman, aged 50. The Lord of the Manor of Ilkley made good his claim, and in 1601 and thereafter, but for how long after 16 10 we do not know, the tenants of Holling Hall paid him 2s. 6d a year, or half-a-pound of pepper, as a tribute and confession of their subjection. In this year, 1590, William Middleton enlarged Stubham Park, through an agreement with Gamaliel Drax, Esq., who seems to have held certain rights in land that stood in his way. In the following years, 1591-2, he is leasing lands in that South-west corner of his estates where the fight was, \u2014 the Intake to Henry Mitchell, at what rent we do not know, and the Springs to John Holmes, yeoman, and his wife, at 2s. yearly. In 1598 he is down in her Majesty's black books as a Recusant (i.e., a Catholic), and pays a fine of fifteen pounds to furnish light horse for Ireland, one in a very long list of fines imposed on the family for fidelity to the ancient Church. The pedigree makers finally tell us he died in 1610, but the records of the family say \" no \" to this; for in 161 3 we find William Middleton, Esq., of Stockeld, and his son, Peter [Middleton, Esq., of Stubham, leased a messuage in Austby to Edward Watson, yeoman, In 1619, Sir Peter leased a messuage in Austby to Reginald Heyber for 1 8 years. Sir Peter Middleton married Mary, daughter and co-heiress of David, second son of Sir William Ingleby, of Ripley, and they had nine children, six sons and three daughters. We presume he went to live at Stockeld on the death of his father, as the Stubham Lodge was rented to Henry Currer, who made a curious inventory of such household stuffe as was delivred unto him, which bears the date July 27th, 1621, and will be found in a subsequent page. In 1622, Sir Peter sold premises in Wheatley to William Bantan. He had a warm heart toward the antiquaries who were then beginning to look into the history of the great old Yorkshire families, and opened the precious archives of the Middletons in 1632 to Charles Fairfax, of Menston, who made copies of many things, and then again in 1637, to Dodsworth, the choicest of them all since Camden, who bears this testimony to his worth : \" Note the charitable piety of Sir Peter Middleton to the cottagers of Burley, who determyning to sell his mannor of Burley, gave the pore cottagers ther houses, yerds & free common for ever, & sold the tennants ther ffarmes att an easier rate than many gentlemen vse to fine their tennants for 3 lyues or 21 yeres. ffor wch his goodnesse toward them they continually pray for him, and in most thankful manner remember him with fervent applause vpon any occasion they heare him spoken of, and the neighbour tennants being hardly vsed by the landlords vse continually to say ' God blesse Sir Peter Middle ton for he dealt otherwise with his tennants,' a rare example in these cold tymes."], [97, "MIDDLETON-WITH-STUBHAM. 89 The good knight died in 1647, in the very thick of the troubles in which Yorkshire took so great and grand a part, and it is probable his wife died some time before, as the York Registers contain this record among the burials in the Cathedral : \u2014 \" The Lady Middleton, buried ye 10 February, 1643.\" The rank and title of knightage for the eldest son seems to have died with Sir Peter, who was succeeded by William, who married Catharine, daughter of Henry Constable, Viscount Dunbar, who bare him three sons and five daughters. William survived his father only 12 years, turned soldier for the King against the Parliament, was made Lieutenant-Colonel of a regiment of horse, threw himself into the Castle of Pontefract (Booth royd says), and with his colleagues nobly defended it. The conse quence was that his estates were confiscated by the Parliament and LORD THOMAS FAIRFAX. Commonwealth, but this confiscation was probably arranged in some way, so that no great harm was done to the family, as we find, by a deed bearing date Jan. 8, 1652, that William Middleton, Esq., and others, grant the manors of Middleton and Stockeld to John and William Lowther for twenty years for six thousand pounds. Colonel Middleton evidently suffered sorely in his mind before he took this step, and cast in his lot with the Cavaliers and the King, and must have waited long, and been greatly influenced by his old neighbour and dear friend, Lord Thomas Fairfax, if we are to judge from the letters we M."], [98, "90 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. shall print, the first from his wife, and the second from his sisters, in which they hint at a promise given to the great general, or some shadow of a promise, that he would not draw his sword against \"the good cause.\" I.\u2014 \"To the Right Honourable The Lord Fairfax, General of the North Present These \u2014 . \" My Lord, \u2014 Be pleased to do me the right as to believe, when, as my husband parted from me, his resolution was according as I wrote yesterday to your Lordship.

In a scarce Tract, entitled, \" Exact and Certain News from the Siege of York,\" we gather the fact that \" Sir Peter Middleton's eldest son, Sir Walter Vavasour, and other gentlemen of quality, were taken at the siege of Castle.\" This would no doubt be Pontefract, and would close the career of Colonel Middleton as a soldier, for we hear no more of his fighting, and so he would come home, take his tearful scolding like a brave and true gentleman, and ' ' I lang his armour in the hall, And study war no more.\" May we not believe also that Lord Fairfax would not be unmindful of his ancient friendship with the father and son, and do what he could to have the estates conveyed in trust to the Lowthers at the rate of payment we have seen, until the storm blew itself out, and the family could come again into full possession. Colonel William Middleton \u2014 for we must not grudge him the title \u2014 was succeeded by John Middleton, his son, who married Jane, daughter of Sir Thomas Strickland, but had no children. It is quite possible that he also took some part in the latter end of the fray with his uncle John, commonly called Sir John, of Thurntofte, as there are two of that name given in the lists. But we cannot be sure of this, and must leave the matter in doubt. In 1679, he was accused before Richard Shaw, Lord Mayor of York, of a conspiracy with Sir Thomas Gascoigne, Sir Walter Vavasour, Lady Tempest, Sir Francis Hungate, and others, to kill the king and establish the Roman Catholic religion in England; but the informer, one Boldron, was a great scamp, and there was a rising market for such wares just then, through which, it would appear, he would fain have made a peck of treason out of a pinch of such talk as he had overheard, looking toward the establishment of the old faith whenever James should mount the throne. John Middleton went into France to be out of the way of this trouble, and then it died away. In 1685 we find him at home again, looking after his property in Ilkley, and leasing to Christopher Beanlands, tanner, the New Crofts, West Holme, Ealands, and fine old Yeates in the Cow Close, for \u00a316 a year, and two fat capons, with the proviso that Master Beanlands shall grind his corn at the Water Corn Mill, in Ilkley. In 1688, he was made a Justice of the Peace for the West Riding by his most Catholic Majesty, who was getting things in training for the restoration of the ancient church and order as he thought, but as it turned out for the revolution. Mr. Middleton rode up to London during the same summer, with Sir Walter Vavasour, to give an account to the King * Fairfax Conesrondence, Civil War Series I., p. 196-7."], [100, "92 ilkley : ancient and modern. touching the answer of the West Riding about the repeal of the Test Acts, and no doubt had no good news to tell, for the West Riding was willing to bear its burden as it stood, rather than run the risk of the trap baited by this bit of cheese. He was living in 1691 with Jane, his wife, at Stockeld, and is set down among the Recusants, and this is the last we hear of the pair. The line failing in Justice Middleton, his brother, Peter Middleton, Esq., made it good again through his marriage with Elizabeth, daughter of Marmaduke, third Lord Langdale, by whom he had four children. He was imprisoned at York in 1680 for refusing to take the Oath of Allegiance, and with this single grain of information about him our readers will have to be content. His son, Marmaduke Middleton, the 20th male heir from Apolitus de Braham, died unmarried, May 6th, 1757, and his brother William, wdio came next in succession, \"and was married but had no children, dying also in 1763, left the estates to William Constable Haggerston, Esq., (the grandson of his sister Elizabeth, the Lady of Sir Carnaby Haggerston), who became the good Old Squire still remembered by old Ilkleyites. He assumed the name of Middelton, and was suc ceeded by his son, Peter Middelton, Esq., who married the daughter of Lord Stourton, and is still fondly spoken of by all the neighbouring inhabitants as ' the Old Squire.' He was father of a large family, as will be seen by the tabulated pedigree, the eldest son, William Joseph Middelton, Esq., J.P., succeeding to the estate in 1866, and is the present owner. Here terminates our brief sketch of a family which has \" worn the white lily of a blameless life\" in Middelton and Stockeld these eight centuries."], [101, ""], [102, "'\u2022u\u00abf g iuoq 'Noxnaa ''tpj \" u-ioq 'Nonaa \u00a3 uioq 'Ntxi/iaaaijv I ! !

(Continued.)\u2014 UbC flMumptOnS flessff elo=witb=Xang bar, HE history of Nessfield-with-Langbar, for almost ioo years after the Conquest, is hidden away in a deep obscurity. The Domesday Book makes only this brief mention of it among the manors William gave to the Percies : \u2014 \"Manor. \u2014 In Nacefield Gamelbar had three carucates of land to be taxed where there may be two ploughs.\" The Percies make no report of what they were doing there in these early days, and yet it is clear from the foregoing Charters, they were at work to some fair purpose, for about 1240 a.d., we find that Nigel de Plumpton, who died just before that date, held lands there in his lifetime from Peter de Percy, for which he paid 42 shillings per annum, and when we get at the particulars of the holding a few years later, we can form some idea of what has been done to put Nessfield into proper trim. Gamelbar's numerous possessions became in a great measure the property of William de Percy, who numbered amongst his chief re tainers in 1 168, \"Nigellus de Plumtona de I[del,] knight,\" and this Niel held Idel, formerly Gospatric's, of Ilbert de Lacy. Whether he was a descendant of Gospatric or not cannot now be definitely stated.* His brother, Gilbert de Plumpton, who took the surname from Plumpton on the Nidd, was a lively young man in n 84. He is thought to have been of noble lineage, and, like young men noble and ignoble, he fell in love with a young lady who was under guardianship ; and as the guardian * Dugdale gives the following descent, viz. , Eldredus, who held lands in Plompton of William de Percy, as appears by Doomsday Book, placing him as father of Petrus de Plompton, living 6 Rd. I., who is stated to have married Helena, and to be father of the ist Nigel de Plompton. Robert, son of Nigel, refers to his grandmother, Helena, and to Orm de Nessfeld, who was uncle to the said Peter. A Deed, No. 18, is destroyed, which would have shewn this Peter to have been living then, and which Dugdale may have seen. It was dated 1194, 6 Rd. I., and was an Agreement between Nigel de Plompton and Simon de Muhalt, concerning two carucates of land in Plompton of the fee of Eustace de Vesey. The MSS. of Chr. Towneley gives an abbreviated copy, and it is the only Charter of that date."], [125, "the plumptons. 113 probably wished to dispose of her to his own advantage, Gilbert, like a noble young gallant, stole her and made her his wife, thereby gaining her property as well. For this (query) dastardly act he was condemned to death ; but popular feeling was on his side, and Baldwin, Bishop of Worcester, was induced to interfere, riding up at the last moment, and forbidding the execution, as it was Sunday, and the Feast of the Blessed Mary Magdalen. The King seconded rather than resented this clerical interference, and Gilbert was liberated on the payment of one hundred marks by his brother, Nigel, or Niel. This Nigel was very kind to the nuns at Esholt, giving them over twenty acres of land in Idel, about 12 10. His son, Peter, held Plumpton, Gersington, Idell, and Ribstain in 12 13, which were seized for a time in consequence of his joining the Barons against King John, but restored eventually. His brother, Robert de Plump ton, was his heir, and gave timber for the church and choir of Helagh Priory out of his woods at Idell. His son, Nigel, held Idell of the Earl of Lincoln, and lands at Nessfield of Peter de Percy, dying, as before stated, about 1240, when it was found that he held Plumpton of the fee of William de Vesey, and other lands there of the fee of William de Percy, value together xx marks vs. iijd.; in the Ville of Nessefeild, of Peter de Percy, cviijs. viijd, rendering for his lands there xiijs. per annum.

The said Nigel held Idell of the Earl of Lincoln, the custody of which was given by the King to Richard, Earl of Cornwall, the King's brother, till the heir was of age.

Know all men that I have granted and by this deed of mine confirmed to Robert my first-born son, and to Lucia daughter of Sir William de Ross, and to their heirs, as a marriage dower, land worth 100 shillings in the vills of Middleton and Langber, viz. : \u2014 \" All the land I have held in Middleton without reservation, and the land which Gilbert son of Alicia, and Ade of Storothes formerly held in Langber, the land which Laurence held in the same, and the land which Hugh Fitz Utting held ; and the land which is called \" terra Seneschall \"* and the land which Richard Cuttwolf held in the same, with common rights, rights of the chase, and turbary, and free entrance for cattle on the common and in the wood of Nessfield. And as regards Sir Patrick de Westwick, and his heirs, they shall freely give one root of ginger on each Christmas day as a quit claim to him of all demands for secular service. And I Robert de Plumpton will warrant and defend the said Robert and Lucia in all these rights of common, turf, chase, pasture and the free range of the wood of Nessfield. And the tenants of the said Robert and Lucia shall grind at my mill in Nessfield, or at their option each in his own mill according to ancient custom.\" This, as our readers will note, is a document of a very genuine interest. Nessfield in those times had a mill of its own, and in this respect surpassed the Nessfield of our day. The mill goit may still be traced beyond West Hall. We get a very interesting glimpse in it also of the tenantry, and of one among them who has won distinction, fighting the wolves which were still prowling about our dale, as we shall see presently.

The young couple thrive in their windy lot, and have four children, two sons and two daughters. Then one of these daughters, Eustasia, is duly courted by Sir Peter Middelton, nephew and heir to Sir Adam, and marries him about 1319, for in that year, Nigel de Plumpton, with Roger, his brother, and Elina, their sister, quit claim to Sir Peter certain lands in Austby, of the yearly rent of sixteen shillings, which had come into the family six years before by deed from 3Helewiz, widow of Nigel de Nestefield.* This surmise as to the date of the marriage is made the more probable from the fact that when Sir Peter died in 1335, or 6, his son Thomas, who succeeded him, was only 15 years of age. We may note here also that Eustasia survived Sir Peter many years, for as late as 1360, John de Mosselay, of York, tailor, gives to \" Eustachie, widow of Sir 3Peter Medelton, Knight,\" certain lands in Austby, which had been given him the year before by Alicia, daughter and heir of Nigel del More. The deed of conveyance was done at Ilkelay, whither no doubt the worthy tailor wended to see that the document was duly signed, 34 Edward III. The witnesses to the 1359 deed were, John Buktrout, John de Ayredale, William Bullam de Ilkeley. But this note of the gift to Sir Peter's widow carries us forty years past the time of which we are writing, and we must return. Sir Peter did not care to be troubled with the Wheatley lands his uncle had got from the Percies, so in 1320 he made out a deed by which they were turned over to John Brantyngh, of Linton ; Radulph de Wheatley, Peter de Stead, Robert son of Simon de Ilkley, John Crokayn, and Thomas de Skallewra being witnesses to this wTiting. There were two sons, as we have seen, brothers to Sir Peter's wife, Robert de Plumpton, who died under age, and Sir William, who succeeded to the Plumpton estates on the Monday before Martinmas, 1324, a.d. This Sir William had married Alice, daughter and heiress of Sir Henry Byaufiz, on the 14th of April, 1322, when his father settled the manor of Nessfield on the young couple and the heirs of their bodies. The bridegroom's father died two years after this marriage, and three years after, in 1325, the bride's father died also, and then his estates came to them with this provision : \u2014 \" That if the said Alice had no children her lands in Brakenthwaite, Plumpton, Folifoot, Ribston, Braham, and Kirby, (held by Sir Henry of the inheritance of * The Austby deeds at Middelton give : \u2014 \" 1313, Helewiz, widow of Nigell de Neste feld, devised to Robert de Plumpton, knight, lands in Austby at xvjs. yearly rent.

Failing issue of Thomas, they fell to Marmaduke de Plumpton and his heirs, with remainder to Adam, son of Peter de Middleton. The lady Alice did die childless, then her bereaven husband Sir William went North in search of another mate, and married Christina [de Mowbray, Harl. MS. 1487], the widow of Richard de Emildon, who had been Mayor of Newcastle in three reigns. He died in 1334, and then Thomas Middleton, a fine lad by this time of 14 or so, came into the estates his aunt Alice had inherited ; from which time, the learned in heraldry say, the Middletons of Stockeld quartered with their coat of arms those of the Huckman branch of the Plumptons. Sir William de Plumpton founded a chantry at Ripon in 1345, of which Henry de Plumpton was first chaplain.

Be this as it may, Sir Robert's widow, Isabella, became the third wife of Sir Nicholas Middleton before 1414, and is given as Isabella Scrope in the pedigree. Robert, son of Sir William, born 1383, succeeded his grandfather at the age of twenty-four.

Sir Godfrey died in 1388, when his daughter was but a year old. Sir Robert ordered his feoffees in 1418, to give xl marks to his sisters Isabella and Katherine for their marriage, and xls. yearly to his brother Richard out of the manor of Nesfield. In 1420 he enfeoffed Dame Alice de Plumpton, his mother, Richard de Norton, Chief Justice of the Common Bench, Thomas de Rempston, chev'r, John Butler, Esq., and John Grene, in his manors of Plompton, I dill, Steton-in-Aierdale, and Nesfeld, and the advowson of the Ripon chantry, a rent charge of four marks out of Plompton. Sir Robert died Dec. 8th, 1421, and was interred at Spofforth. It is believed he was slain at the siege of Meaux, in France. His son, Sir William, was also a soldier in France, but returned in 1430. In 1435, he, with Sir Wm. Gascoigne, Knt, Sir Robert Waterton, Knt, Guy Fairfax and others, were Commissioners to array and muster troops in the West Riding to repel the threatened invasion, and to place signals called Bekyns in accustomed and convenient places, Beamsley Beacon doubt less being one, to warn the people of the approach of the enemy. Sir William's two sons were espoused to Lord Clifford's daughter, as recorded in Whitaker's Craven: \"Beit knowne to all men .... that the lord Sir Thomas Clifford, marryed Elizabeth, his doghter unto Roberte Plumpton, the eldest son and heyre of Sir William Plumpton, when she was bot of six yeres of age.

In the Wars of the Roses, Sir William followed his master, the Earl of Northumberland, in support of the House of Lancaster. He fought at Towton in 1461, where his son William was slain, and he surrendered. By indenture dated 26th Nov., 3 Edw. IV, 1463, the governance and marriage of Margaret, his granddaughter, daughter of William, (slain at Towton,) by Elizabeth Clifford, was granted to Brian Roucliffe, of Colthorp, gent, also it was arranged that John, son and heir apparent of the said Brian, shall take the said Margaret to wife at convenient time, at the costs of the said Brian. She was then about four years of age. Sir William Plumpton covenanted to make to them, and the lawful heirs of their two bodies, an estate out of the manor of Nesfield before the ensuing feast of Pasche ; nevertheless, so as he might retain the whole profits for the first five years, and a rent of x marks by year for the five years next following.

She re-married Sir Richard Hamerton, Knt. Sir William married, clandestinely, Joan Wintringham, and some five years after, committed the secret to Sir Robert Littester, chaplain, who eleven years afterwards, i.e., in 1467, being aged 40, deposed to the same at the trial at York. Sir William and Joan had a son and heir, virtute doni, Robert, born about 1453, and in order to make better advantages in the disposal of his granddaughters in marriage, the wicked old knight care fully concealed the legitimacy of this son. There were also two bastard children of Sir William, viz. : William Plumpton and Robert Plumpton. The will of a Robert Plumpton, of York, 1506, is preserved at the Registry Office. It was on his road to meet the Scots when he divulged the matter of his secret wedding to Joan Wintringham. Sir Robert Littester, his chaplain, was made the confident. Sir William said : \" Robert, do you now return home Because the event of war is dubious, and the solemnization of marriage between me and Joan Winteringham, my wife, has not yet been openly and publickly notified, I hereby make known to you that the said Joan is my true married wife and I her true married husband. And this I wish and desire you, as you love me, if I happen to die in battle, to testify for the future, wherever it maybe necessary.\" The chaplain had occasion, eleven years afterwards, to bear this testimony, and Richard Clerk, clerk of Knaresburg, deposed in 1472 \"that he had known Sir William Plompton for fifty years and more, and Joan Winteringham from the time of her birth \u2014 that on a certain Friday between Easter and Pentecost, about twenty-one years ago, John Brown (vicar of Knaresburgh) came from the high altar (Knaresburgh Church) in his vestments and solemnized marriage between them, in the presence of the deponent, the said Sir William taking the said Joan with his right hand, and repeating after the vicar \u2014 Here / take the Jhennett to my wedded wife to hold and to have, att bed and att bord, for farer or lather, for better for warse, in sicknesse and in hele, to dede us depart, and thereto / plight the my troth ; and the said Joan making like response incessantly to the said Sir William \u2014 that the vicar, having concluded the ceremony in the usual form, said the mass of the Holy Trinity in a low voice, in the hearing of the deponent \u2014 . . . . and further, that Sir William was clad in a garment of green checkery and Joan in one of a red colour.\" John Croft, another witness, deposed that Joan had on a grey hood, and that the marriage was celebrated before sun-rise."], [132, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 120 A lawsuit arose on the marriage of Robert, the son and heir of Sir William and Joan, in 1477, and, in 1480, the Rouclifs became bound in a thousand marks to Sir William and his reputed heir, Robert Plumpton, that they should abide the award of Thomas Burgh, William Gascoigne, Robert Constable and Hugh Hastings, Knights, Robert Sheffield, William Eland, Thomas Fitzwilliam, Thomas Middleton, Edward Saltmarsh, Miles Metcalf, John Everingham, and John Dawney.

Henry Lowcock obtained a lease for 6,000 years of lands in Nessfield and Langbar. Thomas Petty, Robert Marskew, George Styrk, and ffrancis, his son, held similar leases. In 1659, a dispute with Sir Christopher Clapham, about the boundaries from the top of Brandrise to Lathabeck was settled, and in 1692 another Mearstone, or boundary, dispute, between Henry, Earl of Cumberland, and Sir Peter Middelton, was settled, when nine Nessfield, and nine Middleton and Austby tenants sign the document. James Snowdon, Curate de Boulton, is a signator. So run the records of the Manor Courts of Ilkley and Stubham \u2014 Court Baron, Court Leet, and the customary Court of the Manor. They were held in the Manor House always, the Lord or his Steward presiding, the free tenants sitting with him, and with these a certain number of men who had risen or were rising from villenage and serf dom, and were tenants at will. Halmote is derived from two Saxon words, meaning the Hall Con vention, and is the old word for Court Baron. It was the half-yearly meeting of the tenants at the Hall or Manor-house. Frankpledge is composed of two French words, and means the pledge for freemen. The tithing, or court of ten, originally consisted of ten householders, and the ancient custom of England for preservation of the public peace was, that every free-born man at fourteen (Clerks, Ecclesiastics, and Knights, with their eldest sons, excepted), should be customably bound one for another, to see each man of their Pledge forthcoming at all times, or to answer the transgression committed by any gone away, within thirty-one days. The Sheriff, or shire-reeve, had the duty of swearing boys into their pledge, and the inspection of the lists was known as View of Frankpledge. The Statute, 18 Edward II. , re-inforced the custom. It was a Court Leet \u2014 a court of the people, or a court of censure, where all offences under high-treason were enquired into, but few of which it had power to punish after Edward III.'s time. Court Baron is the court of the Lord of the Manor, who in ancient times were called Barons. Surrenders, Admittances and Grants are made, and the Lord or his Steward is Judge, and a second object was the gathering of the Freeholders, or Barones, who are Judges. No Cottage was to be erected without having four acres appro priated to it. 31 Elizabeth. An Affray, a French term, is an affright or skirmish, and is a com mon wrong, whilst an Assault is only a wrong to the party. Both were"], [154, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 134 punishable in a Leet. A chief officer of the Leet was the Ale-taster, who tested the bread and ale sold in the manor ; the Alnager had to measure the cloth made and sold. There must always be one free tenant to sit with his lord, or there could be no court. These freeholders were the sole judges in what was called the Court Baron, as was most fitting, when we note that many of the cases are of the kind in which the manor-lord himself is plaintiff, but damages in the court baron could never rise above 40s., and when cases came up of a more serious nature than breaking heads, vending scandal, harbouring drabs and vagabonds, cutting green wood, poaching, turning runnels of water your way to the damage of your neighbour, or leaving lanes and ditches a shame to landlord, tenant, and town, then they were carried to the higher courts and dealt with there. Our readers will notice in the extracts made from these interesting rolls, that the court held at Stubham reveals only one free tenant who may sit with his lord :\u2014 William Stede in 1475, a\"d \"9 years after wards, Thomas Waite, who has got hold of the Stede freehold. But the Ilkley Court takes on a certain splendour which is never lost. The Abbots of Fountains and Sallay are free tenants, and with them the Plomptons, Middletons, Vavasours, Rocliffs, Darcies, Fitzwilliams, Cliffords, and many more, including George, Earl of Cumberland, and Humphrey, Duke of Buckyngham. This must have made Court day in Ilkley a time of ceremony and observance, and the old manor house, now the castle, a very attractive place for those who were free of the law, and might, perhaps, sit down with their worships to the Court dinner in the hall. The Stubham Court Rolls are much older than those of Ilkley. The earliest fragment is written in Norman French, and the date has been eaten away from it by the tooth of time, or it may be the teeth of mice, as is the case with some of the Plumpton papers, and this earliest record has the ring of the days of the good knight, Sir Peter, whose tenants fell out so sorely with the tenants of the Templars, and relates to affrays in which hot blood and bad, as it might happen, followed the stroke of the quarter staff, and heads were broken so badly that only the lord's court could amend them. The earliest fragment of the Stubham Rolls which bears a date is sive centuries and a quarter old, and supplies the name of a rector of the church which is not to be found in the registers at York, and the second, which bears a date nine years older than the poll-tax lists, is interesting, especially for this \u2014 that we find in it a name which still stays good in Ilkley, and has won in these 500 years and more a touch of distinction. And the whole record of these courts, so far as we may follow them now, must be of very great interest to those who would catch some glimpse of the antique, rural life in the town and on the farms. If we turn to the Stubham Rolls first, we find them full of picturesque touches. John Brunsall, in his wrath, breaks the gate of Bayldon's Close 484 years"], [155, "THE MANOR COURT RECORDS. 135 ago ; Bayldon has his turn at the April Court in the same year, and is fined for taking hollings. Henry del Marche in that year gets a cottage with four acres of land for fourpence a year, a mere song ; but then land went a begging for tenants in the times which followed the Black Death. We see the Wains on the way in the lordship of Austby, and learn they must not stand there. We learn that the tenants were in the habit of dinging down acorns, and plundering Stubham Park of its pales ; and that the servants of the Hall would sell stuff they had no right to sell ; some took geese to pasture that were not hatched in their own houses ; and we have to notice how the whole moral and social life, even in quiet Middleton, suffers damage during the long and terrible Wars of the Roses. Readers will note also that remnant of the ancient serfdom, which, less than 300 years ago, could declare that no poor labourer should leave Middleton in hay time or harvest, but should work at home for convenient wages, while his betters would enact what these wages should be. And how in Middleton there was a pond and a cuckstool for the ducking of scolds, with the cruel provision in one case that the husband should bring his wife to be \"dowked.\" The Ilkley Court Rolls are of a still deeper interest. We learn through them that the town of Ilkley, 420 years ago, had four super visors of buildings ; that the pigs wandered about and did damage to the greensward, so they must be rung. We find the Butts still standing, long after gunpowder came fairly into use, and if we may judge of the store the stalwart bowmen of Ilkley set on this mighty arm of their ancient power and pride, by the way they insist on taking green yew for their bows out of the lord's woods, with the dead certainty that they will be fined for it next court day, they clung to their darling weapon to the last. The Ilkley records show us that as late as 1584, you eat flesh in Lent at your own proper peril, the restriction being by Act of Parliament, to encourage the fisheries ; and that we were given to un lawful games ; and in 1588 we hear of that weary \" little loin \" between Wheatley and Ilkley. It was so impassable, people could not get to the church ; it must be amended ; it is still, or was recently, the same wretched slough, always coming up as a nuisance in the town's meeting ; for ever ordered to be amended, and if fretting and scolding could have done the work, there had been no such bit of road in the dale. We also had our pond and duckingstool, our readers will observe, and duly \"dowked\" our scolds. And we were a very rough lot in Elizabeth's time, for one man is fined for drawing blood on a woman, and Parson Carre is fined half a mark for assaulting Anthony Wrose. We had a leather business evidently of importance also in Ilkley in Elizabeth's time, of which the very tradition is now lost, together with the site of the tan yards, and our readers will observe the long lists of names which run through these records we had lost but for the Court Rolls. My good comrade, Mr. Turner, could only dip into them here and there, it will be seen with what a rare instinct for the things one loves to hear of and see, and no doubt we shall all be of the mind that if these rolls could be printed"], [156, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 136 entire, they would make a volume of quite a peerless interest, touching the life of the parish of Ilkley, and through this of the whole country side in these far away years.

ROBABLY in consequence of the loss of the deeds of the Priory of Hexham, the first sure mention of Holling Hall occurs in 1554, when Christopher Maude is living there, and is patron of the church, ; but he is by no means the first Maude, Mawde, Mahud, Mohaud, Mode, or Mahaut (for the name is spelt in all these diverse ways) to be found in Ilkley. We find a John le Mahaut witness to a deed in 1340, which conveys a messuage and 18 acres of land in Ilkley to Alice, daughter of Richard de Boulton, another witness being Simon del Chirche, who is possibly one of the lost priests. There is a John Mode and his wife again in Ilkley when Richard's men came to lay on the poll tax in 1378, and we find by a deed bearing date 1387, that they either occupied or held an interest in a small farm, a messuage, croft, and twelve acres, at Woodhouses, near Holling Hall, but John was dead by this time, and his widow, Julia, releases her interest in this farm to William Neleson and Margaret, his wife, and we may say also in passing, that this is 93 years before Mr. Foster notices the marriage of a Maude to a daughter of the Keighleys. Yet in a deed March 3rd, 1387, Alice, daughter of Jordan de Kyghley* also releases her right and title to this farm to the same William and Mar garet Neleson. The witnesses were \u2014 Peter de Stede, Richard de Scalwra, Thomas del Grene, and WilL del Stede. In 1442, Sep. 20, Thomas Kyghley and others release to John Neleson, laborer, of Wood house, in Ynkeley, and to Beatrix (his wife), sister of the said Thomas, daughter of Wm. Kyghley, lands at Woodhouse. We find a Thomas Maude again in 1448, and a James Maude in 1467, living in Ilkley. They are fined in the Manor Court for taking green wood, and are tenants at will. In 1509, William Maude made his will, proved May 10, 1510, \"Giving his soul to God, St. Mary and All Saints, and his body * Further notices of the Kyghleys, Nele-sons, &c\u201e will be found in the chapter on Ilkley Families.\""], [159, "HOLLING HALL. 139 to be buried in ye Church of All Saints in Ilkley.\" In 1522, a William Maude appears in the Manor Court in Ilkley, and sits as a freeholder of dignity, but he has no place in the standard pedigrees. Then the Christopher Maude we have mentioned appears as patron of the living ; he died in 1561, and was buried in Ilkley churchyard. In the same year John Maude sits in the Manor Court as a free holder, and in 1563, Anthony Maude, 19 years of age, pays heriot for 30 acres of land on the death of his father, William, the William we may presume of 1522. In 1568, and again in 1572, the living is given by assignment of Arthur Maude, who was living near Bingley \"an old man,\" in 1585, and died in 1587. In 1580, John Maude sits in the Manor Court as a free holder, and in 1583, Thomas and Robert Maude appear as freeholders of land formerly William Maude's, while Thomas also has a freehold at Holling Hall, of lands \"formerly belonging to the Prior of Hexham.\" HOLLING HALL. In 1585-6, we come to the controversy about manor rights, already noticed under the Middletons, and find that Thomas and Robert Maude are brothers, and that Robert was living in York, but he is not in the pedigrees, and it is in this controversy that we trace the Holling Hall homestead back to 1467, but only through an inference. In 1594, Thomas Maude has freeholds in Holling Hall, Ilkley, and Wheatley, and sits for them in the Manor Court. In 1598, he presents to the living, choosing Vicar Snell. In 1600, he was made executor under the will of George Marshall, of which we hear enough in the Grammar School chapter ; but if the old man made a bad mark in"], [160, "140 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. these last years of his life, he did something to amend it at his death, for he left \u00a32 1 3s. 4d. to the poor of Ilkley, and seven cow gates to be let to seven poor families at three shillings each, per annum, and ordered that these rents also should be given to the poor. Robert Maude presents in 1607, and we hear much in the School MSS. of Anthony Maude, of Helthwayt Hill, who is Thomas Maude's executor. In 1632, Robert Maude, gent, presents to the living, and in 1640, Robert Maude, Esquire. It is said that he removed to Ireland \u2014 having sold his estates in Yorkshire \u2014 and died there in 1685 ; that he had a son, Anthony Maude, who was M.P. for Cashel in 1695; and that this Anthony was ancestor to Sir Cornwallis Maude, Viscount Hawarden and Baron Montalt. These notes only remain to be made of the family in Ilkley. In 1632, Anthony Maude married Elizabeth Sheffield of our town, who was of the house to which Richard Middleton granted certain premises in Ilkley for one life in 1505, and they had a son, William, born in 1634; and Robert Maude, Esq., appears as late as 1662, and releases to Sir Peter Middleton a parcel of ground and cottage in Ilkley they had held 40 years. The Maudes then are found in our parish as early as 1340, exactly 300 years before they present to the living for the last time. When we find them connected with property it is close to Holling Hall, when we find them in a home it is in Holling Hall, though it is evident they multiply apace and need more than one. We find them in Ilkley, 140 years before the pedigrees give them a date, over by Bingley, and we note they rise slowly but surely in Ilkley to wealth and station. The Holling Hall lands under some name belonged to the Monks of Hexham before the Reformation, moreover, we find a Will Holynhalgh in the Manor Courts in 1458. We may conclude, therefore, that this was the Grange of the Monks of Hexham, and that here, and in Woodhouse, we find the top root of this remarkable family tree. It was fitting that Thomas Maude, in his Verbeia, should sing of us and wander lovingly about our church, and, if indeed, any of them have risen to such eminence that some of the blood of these husbandmen, yeomen, and esquires of Ilkley, runs in the veins of Viscounts and Barons, it comes back for some of its virtue to the sweet lands by the Wharfe, and finds its cradle in Holling Hall. 2.\u2014 \u0152be fbebets. Reginald, son of Thomas Heber, of Marton-in-Craven, came to live in our parish in 16 19, and rented a messuage in Austby from Sir Peter Middleton, on a lease of 18 years. He had lost his first wife before this, but married again, probably after he came to Austby, as his eldest son John was born and baptized in 1621. In 1629, he was one of the overseers of the parish, and took charge of one of the newly made keys of the great parish chest, in 1632, when he"], [161, "HOLLING HALL. 141 was elected warden. In 1633 he gave bonds to Sir Peter Middleton to stand an arbitration for what purpose we do not know. In 1635, he is on the list of those good men who resolve to build a school house in Ilkley and pay for it. His lease at Austby would expire in 1638, and in this year he is first spoken of as Reginald Heber, Esq., of Holling Hall. He had seven children, four of them died in his life time, and there is something very fearful about the successive entries touching three of them in the parish registers, they suggest some sort of black fever in the house, and we may imagine, as we read them, how the heart of the whole parish would be stirred to pity for the desolate old man. \" 1649\u2014 Buried April 18, Captain John Heber; 1649 \u2014 Buried April 29, Letitia Heber; 1649 \u2014 Buried May 3, Christopher Heber.\"* They were all in their beautiful prime, \"Lettice\" was 18, John 28, and Christopher 26. The latter date does not chime with that on the brass, but it is drawn from the registers by the careful hand of Mr. Turner, and if our readers will turn to the epitaph of the last, from Romans viii. 38-39, they will surely agree that no grander trust was ever shown in our human history than this Reginald Heber holds in his sore and sad heart as he sits there in his silent home. He went to his children four years after, 1653, in his 73rd year. Captain John Heber fought for the Commons in the great quarrel, as we gather from a note in Heywood's Diaries. He was married and left a son, Thomas, who was nine years old when his father died, so that Captain John married betimes, but this is all we know about him. Reginald Heber, the second son, was bred to the Law, and was styled of the Inner Temple, London, but it is probable that he came home when this great calamity fell on his house, and took charge of the estate when his father died as there was no one else. In 1659, we find this entry touching him in the town's books: \u2014 \" Reginald Heyber to by close for John Longfellow boy xs.\" The old dim line holds a fine suggestion when we remember who these Hebers and Longfellows were who then lived in our parish, and one wonders whether this boy had some hint in him of the genius that flowered out finally in his race which attracted the attention and stirred the heart of the kindly young Heber from the Inner Temple. Reginald Heber was Churchwarden in 1660, and this is the last we hear of him until he makes his will, in 1696, and leaves the to our church and school. He died the year after, and was buried in Ilkley Church, May 13, 1697. Thomas Heber, son of Captain John, was born in 1640, and did not maintain the good name of his race. \"Thomas Heber and others, for a Burglary, March 30, 1676, before Walter Hawksworth, Esq.

He was a tall man. And another of the said persons went to his daughter, Elizabeth Beecroft, being in bed in a room near adjoyning, and would have smothered her in the bed cloths. And one of the said persons, being a tall man, broke open a cupboarde and a deske and tooke from thence above \u00a32 ios. and a little piece of beefe. And on their goeing away they left behind them one iron gavelocke, one staff, and a wood wedge. There were other persons att the doore whom he heard whistle when they went away.

So we find him next in the character of a respectable \"informer.\" These were times of great distrust of the Roman Catholics. Titus Oates had forged his famous story of the Plot, and published it in August of the year when we light on Thomas Heber again, and England was wild with apprehen sion, which may be all pleaded in Heber's favour. The story is pic turesque and graphic in its way as that of the burglary, and 200 years after the \"tall man\" did these things we may even feel obliged to him on the whole for becoming the medium and mirror through which we catch these glimpses of the long lost life. \" Dec. 17, 1678.

Hee tould mee he knew nott, but he would fetch him downe into my roome againe if I pleased. I desired him to doe soe and accordingly hee did. And the gentleman beeing set doune by mee I asked him which way he travilled. Hee tould mee to Broughton Hall and intended there to inhabit. And hee likewise tould mee he intended to follow his calling theire of pollishing glasses for prospectives and specktacles and mycroscops. I asked him wheare hee was borne, what was his name, and wheare hee lived. To the first, hee answered hee was borne at Yorke, and that his name was John Cornwalls, and that hee lived att London, butt came doune to Yorke about six months since, and from Yorke hee was then travilling to Broughton Hall, the joynter house of the Lady Tempest. Whereupon hee offered to take his leave, butt I told him I had something more to say, and then asked him what religion hee was of. He tould mee per haps hee was a seeker, which indirect answer gave mee occation to send for the Captain of the Gard. And by his assistance and the constabl's we sought a trunk of the said Cornwallis out of which were taken 5 letters, one in English and 4 composed of Lattin, Greeke and Heberu, which letters wee sent with the prisoner by the Constable of Skipton to John Assheton and Henery Marsden Esqrs., two of his Majesty's Justices of the peace. And upon his examination theire was 5 letters produced, which I verily beelieve was the same which I see taken out of the trunk att Skipton and the prisoner owned as much beefore the above named justices.\"* It is just possible, but not probable, that this was a Thomas Heber, of Marton. Our Thomas Heber had a habit, it seems, of going to Skipton and frequenting the taverns, as the note we have mentioned, and shall now copy, shows. \" 1 68 1. \u2014 Day not known, but in the summer.

Thomas Heber appears as churchwarden in 1690, but after this we hear of him no more. He married Mary, daughter of Edward Parker, of Browsholme, about 1663, and she died at Upper Woodhouse in 1721. John Heber, son of Thomas, was baptized in 1664, and was elected churchwarden five years before his father, in 1685, when he was 21, so we may believe he was of the finer Heber type, staunch and steadfast. We only find him once again, as Residuary Legatee under the will of his great uncle, Reginald; this is in 1701, when the church and school lands are purchased in Netherdale, and we judge from the care he takes, that any loss in the estate shall be a loss also to the church and school, that the Holling Hall property needed nursing. John died in 1708, and was buried the day after Christmas. His wife survived him 32 years, and died at the Hall in 1640. Master Joseph Smith, the last of the old order of parish clerks in Ilkley, who died about 1839, a very old man, used to tell us how his mother remembered this last \" Lady Heber \" of Holling Hall, and her generous heart toward the poor. There is a Mary Ileber married to Benjamin Beanlands in 1685, who must have been Thomas Heber's daughter, and he had two more chil dren. John Heber also, and his wife Sarah, had five children, possibly six, but the vital life was exhausted, they all died quite young, except the youngest, Sarah, and she died at 33. She married Richard Strother, gent., of Holling Hall and Otley, Attorney-at-Law, who sur vived his wife 15 years, died at Shipley, and was buried at Ilkley in 1749. They had children, but here the line of the Hebers of Holling Hall ends. Note. \u2014 It is generally believed that the Hebers of Holling Hall were ancestors of Bishop Heber, and the writer has done his share to propagate this idea, but it is not true. Bishop Heber was of the line of Thomas Heber, of Marton, brother to the first Reginald Heber, of Ilkley, so they are of the same blood, but not the same descent. The line separates when Reginald comes to Ilkley in 16 19, and never touches again. * Oliver Heywood's Diaries, edited by J. Horsfall Turner, Vol. 2, p."], [165, "HOLLING HALL. 145 1."], [166, "146 ILKLEV : ANCIENT AND MODERN."], [167, "HOLLING HALL. 147 3.\u2014 Zbe Currers, &c We have made the Maudes and Hebers the central point of interest in the history of our ancient Hall, but they do not exhaust the story of its human life. The lands which formed the ancient Monks' Manor seem to have fallen into the hands of Sir Godfrey Fuljambe at the harrying of the monasteries, and he appears in the Manor Court to answer for them in 1561, 1580, and 1583 ; between the last date and 1594 he has sold the Holling Hall estate to four men : \u2014 Thomas Maude, William Currer, William Rogerson, and William Waide, and there were four home steads, where we find but one now, of which the Hall was the most eminent, where the Maudes were then living. William Currer came from Marley-in-Harden, but he is not the first of his name in Ilkley, for we find Henry Currer in Ilkley, a tenant at will, in 1443, who appears in Court to answer for taking the lord's green wood. In 1584, this William, who had married a daughter of Christopher Maude, of the Hall, was summoned to answer for casting carrion into the water to the injury of his neighbours, and fined i2d., from which we may conclude that the families were not on very good terms. William Currer had four children, the eldest was named Henry. He married Dorothy, daughter of William Maude, who bore him four children, of which William was a boy eight years old, and the youngest was still un born when their father died in September, 1598, and was buried at Ilkley. Meanwhile, Henry Currer, of Kildwick, whose wife was Anne, daughter of Christopher Wade, of Addingham, had a son Henry, who rented Stubham Lodge in 162 1, so that there were two families of Currer in our parish in the last years of James I., close of kin and so blended that we cannot now divide them, but must take them as they come. In 16 19, Thomas Currer is an overseer in our parish, and in 1 62 1 churchwarden. In 1632, Henry Currer, tenant of the Lodge, is warden. In 1666, another Henry is warden, and in 167 1 overseer and gentleman. He is the son of William Currer, of Holling Hall, who died in 1664, and left \u00a35 for the poor in his son's hands, which the son refused to pay ; complaint was made at York but still he did not pay. In 1683, he is dead, and his widow has gone to live at Burnsall taking the legacy with her. She also is presented at York in that year and in 1687 ; but it is no use, and so the proverb comes true about getting butter out of a dog's throat. But another William Currer, who is overseer, gives ,\u00a312 to the school in 1686, which is paid, so we must count this to the family. This William was a trustee of the school fund left by George Marshall and Reginald Heber, and helped to invest it well in Netherdale. In 1758, Joseph Currer, gentleman, trots down to Weston with Vicar Beeston to look up the school deeds, and get them copied in the form that has come down to us, and into my hands, sets his name to the work when it is done, and this is the last of the Currers in Ilkley, so far as we can trace them. There is a span of 315 years between Henry, the tenant at will, and Joseph, the gentleman ; and the"], [168, "148 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. main root of the family tree is found in Kildwick. They rose to eminence, and allied themselves with the Richardsons, of Bierley, and other families of note, and among them sent down to our day that gracious lady and lover of antiquity \u2014 Dorothy Currer Richardson, whom Dibden celebrates in his Northern Tour. The Rogers, or Rogersons, make no mark in our parish. William, who bought the farm, died in 1613, leaving a son Thomas, who died in 1635, at Holling Hall. He had four children, Lionel, William, Thomas, and Mary, but what became of them after this we do not know. The fourth freeholder of Holling Hall, William Waide, died in 1619, left four children : Anthony, who married Mary Ferrand ; Isabel, who married the schoolmaster, Lobley ; Margaret, who married John Nichol son, and Elizabeth, and then they also get lost. There is a word remaining still to be said about the old monk's manor, or some part of it, subsequent to its occupation by the Hebers. The Holling Hall estate was purchased by the Morleys, of Beamsley Hall, from Mr. John Fish, in 17 14, and settled on John, their eldest son. He married Ann Denison, and died about 1721, leaving three children, Josias, Elizabeth, and Margaret.

HE ancient Saxon Church in Ilkley was spared, we suppose, in the great devastation of 1068-9, because Domesday Book says there is a church and a priest, while the manor is still \" waste.\" We may notice also, that there is no sign of fire on the Roman and Saxon sculptures which still remain, or on the- stones in the walls of the Church and \" Castle \" ; so when the poor creatures, who had been harried out of their homes, began to creep back, and to build up the waste places, Church and Priest would be ready to take them in, and help them to make the circle good about the hearth, the altar, and the grave. Still the history of the church and its priests is a mere blank for more than 150 years after the date of Domesday, with the exception of one solitary hint in a deed which conveys half a carucate of land in Asquith to the monks of Sallay. This deed bears no date, but seems to be of the times of Appolitus, first lord of Middleton, and is witnessed by R. priest of Yelleclay. But in 1241, we find Dominus Robert de Flexthorp, clerk, instituted rector of Ilkley, 14 cal. December, under the patronage of Dom. Phil, de Kyme. He holds the living for the long term of 45 years, if we may trust the list as compiled by Torre, and is succeeded 2 id. Oct., 1286, by Dom. William Malherbe, sub deacon, who is rector over eight years, Sir Philip de Kyme, Knt., patron. Dom. William de Askeby, deacon, succeeds him, 2 kal. Apr., 1295, and serves twelve years. Then 10 kal. Nov., 1307, we have Dom. Robert de Cotyngham, acolyte, who stays about seven years, and gives place to Dom. William de Cotyngham, with Sir William de Kyme, Knight, as patron, 12 kal. July, 13 14, and closes Whitaktr's list of rectors ; but Dodsworth makes a record of one presentation more made by William de Kyme, Dec. 20, 1322, leaving out the name of the rector, and here the list ends, until it opens again with the vicars, after the living has fallen into the hands of the monks of Hexham. The De Kymes are patrons of the living when we hear about it for the first time in 1241, and hold the presentation in their hands until they merge their name into that of the Earls of Angus, in Scotland, who got hold"], [173, "cAi/Le Jtncitnt /Tcarage at cJlkley"], [174, ""], [175, "the church. 153 of it through wedding the last of the De Kymes, who had the ill luck, as things went in those days, to be a woman. Dodsworth MSS., 28, folio 142, Gilbert de Humfraville, Count Angos, recovered before the judges of the King, at Westminster, his presentation to the Church of Ilkley against Thomas de Ros, of Hamelak, and presented to the same 10th May, 37th Edward III., 1364. Meanwhile, we find a tiny taper now and then one can use for our main purpose. Hopkinson says, \"William, son of Sir Adam de Middleton, sounded a chantry within the Church of Ilkley, which was dedicated to St. Nicholas, and was valued in 1253 at \u00a34 7s. od.\" But our excellent antiquary must be out of his reckoning as to the sounder of this chantry or chapel, because Sir Adam had no son, and the only William we hear of in those days was his younger brother. He must have been very much younger than his brother, or else he must have taken very early to \" good works,\" as Sir Adam lives 66 years, to our sure knowledge, after 1253, where we find our report of the worth of the chantry, so we must conclude there was another William we have lost, or that some other man was founder of this chantry of St. Nicholas, which was on the south side of the church, where the effigy, ascribed to Sir Adam, lay before the church was restored, and the little font for holy water still remained as the Reformation left it. We may safely ascribe the building and endowment of this chapel to the middle of the 13th century, and to the William de Middleton who was High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1239 and 1241. It would be a very interesting addition to the church, and rector Flexthorp, in whose time it was done, also saw the chapel built within the manor house at Nessfield by the Plumptons, and would live to burn some of the incense before the high altar of his own church. Rector Malherbe had to pay some \u00a32 7 in our present money \"for and against the Scots\" in 1290. In the same year the Monks of Bolton pay about \u00a3\\o of the same tenor to the Church of Ilkley \" in a pension.\" Rector Robert de Cotyngham is indebted to Sir Adam de Middleton 10 marks, in the money of that time, in 1305 ; and this is all that is known about the church and the rectors of Ilkley down to the year 1378, when we find the deed con veying the living to the Monks of Hexham. The papers which cover the entire transaction may be found in the volumes about that Monastery, published by the Surtees Society, but we have only space for the gist of them here. In 1378, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, gave to the prior and canons the advowson of Ilkley. The appropriation of the Church of Ilkley to the Prior and Monas tery at Hexham : \u2014 \" Alexander (Neville) by divine permission Archbishop of York, to the Prior and Monks of Hexham, greeting : \u2014 Your petition lately pre sented to us said that the revenues of your Monastery were so much diminished that you could not well support yourselves. \" You allege as reasons for this that your monastery is situated in a u."], [176, "ilkley : ancient and modern. 154 place not very fertile and near the marches of Scotland on the public road. That you are subject also to the invasions of the Scots, in which they frequently burn your houses, rob you of your men, drive away your cattle, and consume your goods, and that, added to these evils, you are exposed to constant danger from disease and pestilence of men and cattle, and are burdened with debt so that you cannot meet the expenses of your hospitality to the nobles and others, rich and poor, who daily come to you in great numbers, and are obliged to forego many other works of charity : \" You cannot bear these burdens unless you obtain more generous aid, and have begged us to unite to your monastery the living of the Parish Church of Ilkley, over which you have already obtained the right of patronage, by the gift of the noble Lord Henry de Percy of Northumberland. We therefore are inclined to grant your supplication, and with the consent of the Chapter, and by our Authority, do in- corporate the said Parish Church of Ilkley with all its fruits and revenues, and give it to you and your monastery for ever. We grant you also permission to take possession of the said church, with its rents and revenues, on the resignation or death of the present rector, reserving from its income a proper allowance for maintaining a vicar in a manner suitable to his condition, and hereby fix an annual pension of 20s. to be paid from the fruits of the said church, of which 13s. 4d. must be paid to us, and 6s. 8d. to the Dean and Chapter, but should you ever lose the church you shall then be free from the payment of this pension. \" Given at our Manor of Cawood the 1 2th day of January, year of our Lord's Incarnation, 1378. John de Clifford, treasurer of our church, John de Waltham, canon, and Robert de Mansfeld, clerk.\" \u2014 (Vol. 46, pp. 147-15 1.) The Monks of Hexham held the living from this time to the Reforma- tion, a period of 150 years. It was hard for our people, one thinks, to pay fruits and tithes to maintain a place so far away, but we know nothing about the matter beyond this deed, and a hint or two we may gather from the papers which touch the later times. Sixty-five years after this gift, August 20, 1443, we find the Prior of Hexham leasing the parsonage of Ilkley, with its lands and tenements, for ;\u00a3io by the year, to Stephen Robynson, Nicholas Clapham, and John Alemere; and 22 years after this again, in 1465, the Manor Court of Nesfield passes an order that \" The Wall before the Parsonage be taken downe as it ought to be on payne of 3s. 4d \" In 1518, we meet with the Oath taken by the Churchwardens : \u2014 \" (Hhmfyi Wm1)tn_i!i, tjrgs sjrall hi gonr tlrttrp, to hi tnxi to 600 an!) ta t\\i A%\\txt\\t, for lobi nor hbonx off no wan, togtlrc in i|gs f txm\\t to foiljroolo ang ggglrt to t\\t <&bm\\i, but ta \"gmibi t|u gtttgs to fcgt tflonjigtht, or .digs ta goo to thi itbtU.\" Abp.

May 14, 1551, or about a year before this transfer of the living to John Middleton, Esq., Edward the King had granted to the twelve Governors of the School of Sedbergh \" all the whole late chauntry of St. Nicholas in Ilkley, with all its rights in Backstone beck lees, Edes, Longlands, le Cow leaze, le Cow close, Bowdyes, Ragbe Cow close, Holme, Inghill, Close stones, Dyke close, Esle close, &c, in the occu pation of Richard Parysh, Richard Robinson, William Shutt, Thomas Swyer, Francis Meryng, and William Cowgill, lands that had been given by the Middletons for perpetual prayers in a little chapel to the right as one enters the church.

In 1588, our readers will remember the Manor Court made an order which has not yet been carried out, that the inhabitants of Wheatley and Ilkley should amend the Churchway, \"t' little loin,\" before Martinmas. In 1632, we find there is a chest provided for the Church and Parish records, with four locks, and an order is made that each of the four Churchwardens shall hold one of the keys to this chest. In 1659, we find the clock duly set up in the tower, which some of us still remember as a very rude machine, re peatedly out of time, and had only one hand pointing to the hours, which were struck \u2014 when the thing consented to strike \u2014 on the one sound bell. The \" Clarke \" in this year is paid four shillings half yearly for keeping the clock, and, 17 years after, his wages are raised to ios. 6d. by the year. In Pope Nicholas's first taxation the church was valued at 13s. 4d., and in his second at \u00a317 6s. 8d., in the King's books at \u00a3i 13s. 6d, and in the Parliamentary Survey, XVIII, p. 349, at The Valor Eccles. mentions the chantry. In 1667, we come on \"A Terrier of all the glebe lands, tythes,"], [178, "156 ilkley : ancient and modern. offerings, and other dues belonging to the Vicar of Ilkley, Delivered at the Visitation of Richard, by the grace of God, Lord Archbishop of York,\" from which we may gather some idea of the way the parson picked up a living in our parish 200 years ago, and also of the terms on which the living was held from a time immemorial. 1. \u2014 A small house and garden, value about \u00a32 10s. od.

And upon every house threepence, and one penny egg. And upon every pauper's house of twopence each. Every person of the age of 16 pays twopence each as communicants. Two gardens in Ilkley pay a penny each, and every corn mill pays a composition. 4. \u2014 Tithes in kind (are paid) of pigs, calves, swarms of bees \u2014 one wonders if his reverence took the tenth bee, \u2014 of goslings also, and foals, rape seed, wool, and lambs, half a lamb at five, and a whole one the second best at six. 5.\u2014 The tithe of hens in Austby and Nessfield. 6. \u2014 A small composition for the hay, and for all lands on the South side of the river Wharfe, and for three farms on the North side. 7. \u2014 The Surplice dues, viz., Fees for breaking ground in the church yard, one shilling. Offerings for each woman after a child birth, eightpence. Publication of banns of marriage, sixpence; marriage by banns, one shilling; marriage by license, ten shillings. Mortuaries according to Act of Parliament (which meant in early times the best horse). We gather the fact also from a complaint made at York, that in the beginning of the last century it was still the custom to read prayers in the church on Wednesdays and Fridays, and that, in 1683, two Common Prayer Books had been bought for the church, costing 26s., for which the parish owed Thomas Hebden. In June, 1691, a Register was bought for 2s. 6d., the engrossing of which cost 2s., and the parchment cover, which still remains, 7d. The parson's surplice cost 5s., and its washing 6d., and other curious matter, touching the antique life that clustered about the church, will be subsequently given. The succession of vicars, with what is known of them, may be noted at no great length of time and space. Sir Gilbert de Thorpe, acolyte, a young man not yet in full Orders, is the first vicar whose name occurs under the new regime. We cannot find when he came to the living, but certainly not so early (13 18) as has been stated,* and this is all we know about our first Vicar. His Will wherein he is styled Gilbert, Vicar perpetual of Ilkley, was proved at York in 1406. The Prior and Convent of Hexham present the first six vicars. In the same year (1406) Sir Richard Garmouth, presbvter, is * Yorkshire Arch\u00e6ological Journal, VII., p. 45i\u00bb."], [179, "THE CHURCH. 157 inducted, September 22, as the fitting crown and glory, let us hope, of Ilkley Feast, which falls on the first Sunday after the 14th, and not on All Saints Day, as we should expect. He died in his nest in the winter of 1427, his will was proved December ioth, in that year, and runs : \u2014 \" Richard Garmouth, perpetual Vicar of the Parish Church of Ilkley makes this will, giving his soul to God and St. Mary and All Saints, and his body to be buried in the Chancell of the said Church.\" He was succeeded, 10 January, 1427, by Sir William Whyte, presbyter, who held the living to the time of his death, the long term of 45 years, the longest on record among the vicars of Ilkley, and has left no other record. He was succeeded, 7 Feb., 1472, by Sir John Barton, capellanus, who, being of a good family, probably got a better living, for he resigned in about a year, and, March 9, 1473, was succeeded by Sir Thomas 3Herper, capellanus. In the Institution Books, &c, of the Archbishop, at York, containing a mine of unworked genealogical matter, we find that Thomas Harper was of the old family at Calverley, that he was acolyte in 1467, also Richard Harper, of Calverley, acolyte in the same year, probably brothers of Walter Harper, of Calverley, sub- deacon and priest in 1456. Richard became subdeacon in 1467, on the recommendation from Esholt, and Thomas, by title, from Pontefract. A certain splendour touches the name of Vicar Herper, in the fact that for thirteen years, if the earlier date in the Manor Court Rolls stands true, he was lord of the Manor of Ilkley, as well as vicar of the church. It was granted to him by Robert Roos, on the eve of the tempest that blew Richard III. out of life, but while he was still in the heyday of his power, and may have been a politic stroke on the owner's part to save the estates in those troubled times by putting them into the vicar's hands for a season. Thomas Herper had his vicarage on a longer lease, for he served us about 34 years, and then dying, was succeeded, June 15, 1507, by Thomas Jenkynson, presbyter. Sir Thomas Jenkynson, as he is called, in the usual priestly title of those days, seems also to have been a man of mark. He was a freeholder in Ilkley as well as vicar, and appears in the Manor Court in 1522 in that character. He had pre- viously been a curate at Halifax, and wills were frequently proved in his presence. He was highly esteemed in Halifax parish, as shewn by his frequent appointment to the offices of executor and supervisor of wills. John Hanson, of Southowram, will proved Dec. 1509, appointed Sir Thomas Jenkynson, Vicar of Ilkley, a supervisor. He was vicar of our parish about 16 years, that is, to the time of his death, and was suc- ceeded, April 9th, 1523, by Sir Thomas Wardall, presbyter (on the presentation of the assignees of the Prior and Convent), of whose presence we find no trace save the name ; yet he lived quite through the great woe to his order of the earlier Reformation, and saw the monks driven out of Bolton. At his death, he was succeeded, June 10, 1541, by"], [180, "158 ILKLEY : ancient and modern. Sir George Cronell, capellanus, who took the living from Henry VIII., and lived to enjoy it a little more than four years, when he was succeeded, Dec. 4, 1545, by Sir John Mydhop, clerk, who also was indebted to the King for this favour. He also is a man of \" no name,\" nor do we know what became of him, but nine years after his induction, Sir John Pulleyne, clerk, is made vicar, Sep. 18, 1554. when we find the living in the gift of Christopher Maude, of Holling Hall. Vicar Pulleyne was probably of the family of that name which had lived and flourished to the East and North of us many hundred years, and can be traced in the parish at quite an early day, but he fell on evil times, or was not the man for the place. He was deprived in any case, and was succeeded, July 8, 1568, (on the presentation of the assignees of Arthur Maude), by Sir John Wylsonne, clerk, who resigned the living after four years, and gave place, under the same patronage, to Thomas Carre, clerk, who came to the parish Aug. 2, 1572. Par son Carre \u2014 the name is fragrant in our dale \u2014 was not a vicar to be proud of. He was fined 6s. 8d. in 1580, by the Manor Court, for an assault on Anthony Wrose. Anthony was an evil man, and harboured evil company, and one fears the vicar was of that turn, for if he had merely whipped the scamp as a means of grace in those burley times, the Court would have found some way to a verdict of \" served him right.\" He died vicar, however, after holding his place for eleven years, and then Aug. 6, 1583, Hugo Rawood, clerk, got the living from my lord of York, to whom it had fallen by lapse. We know nothing of Vicar Rawood, who served twelve years, and then vanished, we know not where. William Cockeson, clerk, became vicar, Oct. 9, 1595, by savour of the Queen Elizabeth, and held the church only three years, when he resigned, went his way, and George Snell, clerk, became vicar, through Thomas Maude, gent., who had again taken up the gift formerly held by the family. We pre sume Vicar Snell had done the work of the parish as curate to both the incumbents last named. He was curate of Ilkley in 1591, and in that year married Jane Hogg of our town and parish, whose father was a pushing man; and had built a house on the waste, for which he had to answer. She was a young woman probably; they had a license from York, and were married in Addingham Church; in 1594 he was here, and was not made vicar until 1598, Dec. 13th ; and then, in 1607, Vicar Snell died, was buried May 27th (Ilkley Register), but we shall hear of him again, for in the year 1600, he was made one of the Trustees under the will of George Marshall, to whose generous gift we owe the founding of our Grammar School, and for the rest of his life had much trouble touching the laying out of his parishioners' money, and does not show, apparently, the unselfish spirit one would wish to see. Richard Hodgeson, clerk, and M.A., came next, being inducted"], [181, "the church. 159 Sept 29, 1607, on the presentation of Robert Mawde, gent., and con tinuing vicar 33 years, to the very edge of the great Puritan quarrel. The families of Hodgeson are of very great antiquity in several parts of West Yorkshire. The Hodgsons of Boiling, near 3Bradford, produced at least one clergyman, often referred to in wills about the time of the Reformation, and a \" Sir Richard Hogson, chaplayn \" was witness to the will of Robert Mauleverer, Esq., of Allerton Mauleverer, 1500. A Richard Hogeson, clerk, Vicar of Calverley, died in 1573, and directed by his will, proved in Dec., 1573, \"that his body be buried at Calverley.\" There are two small brasses at Ilkley, to the Vicar of Ilkley and his son : \u2014 \u25a0 HEARE LYETH BVIRED THE BODY OF RICHARD HOGHON WHO WAS MINISTER IN THIS PLACE WHO DEPARTED THE 7 OF APR AN.

How this brass came to Ilkley, it is impossible to say, but as it is part of a large one to the Prebend, and probably had some inscription obnoxious to the Reformers, the Robinsons use this fraction without compunction. These Robinsons were probably of the Ilkley family, as the present Vicar of Stillington finds no trace of Reyner or Robinsons there at that time, and yet it is perplexing to discover how the brass came here, and does not seem to have been fixed here in modern times, unless Robert Hodgson, who held Stillington for four years, was the means of its transit. Of course, there is nothing to show that it has ever been at Stillington. Our Vicar Hodgson was succeeded, May 4, 1640, by Anthony Coates, or Coatts, clerk, with Robert Mawde, Esquire, as patron. This vicar saw all the troubles of the Civil War, followed the fiery move-"], [182, "160 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. ments of the great family at Denton, felt the jar and shock of Marston Moor, no doubt, in his quiet parsonage; saw Cromwell march past Ilkley on his way to Preston, and Rupert scour down the dale, bent on burning Denton, but sparing the place after all for the sake of his old comrade in arms, whose portrait hung on the wall. He lived to see Cromwell pass away on the terrible stormy night, and perhaps to wish him back again, as he heard of the godless doings in London ; died intestate in the summer of 1665, when letters of administration were granted to Anne Coatts, his relict, who set up a brass tablet to his memory at the South-east end of the nave : \u2014 Vicar Coates was, for several years, Master of Bradford Grammar School, and one wonders if Vicar Luke Coates, of Birstal, was a near relation. William Hustler, clerk, and A.B., was made vicar by the Arch bishop, by lapse, January 19, 1665, and held the living 38 years, to the utter degradation and ruin of the parish, so far as it could be ruined by such a man. In twenty years after his entrance on the sacred work, the parishioners were compelled to enter a complaint against him at York for non-residence. In 1691, they entered another complaint against him for suffering the vicarage house to fall to ruin, and for absenting himself from the vicarage for almost ten years. He seems to have done nothing to his residence five years after this, when they present him again; and in 1702, a year or so before his death, they present him again, this time \" For frequenting ale houses without just occasion, and drinking and spending his time idly, for not reading the Common Prayer on Wednesdays and Fridays, and for not going to administer the Sacrament to Richard Mann,* an old weak person, on being desired to do so.\" He had got Mr. William Wood appointed curate, by that delectable Bishop of Chester \u2014 Thomas Cartwright \u2014 in 1687, and the natural expectation of the parish was that he would pay the young fellow his wages ; but nothing could be farther from the vicar's purpose than that, and so the parish has to pay him at the rate * He lived to be the wonder of the Parish. \"Richard Man, of Beckfoot, buried January the 23rd, 1711, in ye hundred and fifth year of his age.'' \u2014 Ilkley Registers."], [183, "THE church. 161 os 7s. 6d. a service and his dinner. They employ a Mr. Hey also, and a Mr. Wright, when Curate Wood is not to be found, and on one occasion employ \"a stranger\" to preach for the sum of 2s. 6d. And as the parson drinks, so do the wardens, nor do the curates fall behind, as we shall see when we come to the records of expenses in another chapter. The vicar's wife died, and was buried Jan. 26, 1702, and then in May, 1703, he died, and was buried May 3 ; and this ends the sad story of a ruined and wasted life. The Rev. George Dawson, clerk, followed vicar Hustler; his preferment bears date September 20, 1703, and his patron was Stephen Wilks, Esquire. He is styled vicar and ludimagister (schoolmaster,) in a complaint made at York in 1708, \"that he has not yet shown his Orders,\" from which we gather that the parish had no real proof at that time of his standing among them, and wanted to be sure after their long and sore experience with the last vicar. In 17 11, he was summoned on complaint of the parish, before a Commission held in Leeds, for refusing free tuition to all the male children of the parish that should come to him, being bound to do this by the will of Reginald Heber, of the Inner Temple, London, who had left to the school, in 1696, on these conditions. The Commissioners ordered him to obey the will, and if he failed, the money was to go to a teacher who would obey the rules. Vicar Dawson seems to have been a stranger ; and we know very little about him. The wardens spend two shillings on a Mr. Snowdon [of Bolton,] who preached for him in 1716, and the vicar was buried Sept. 3 in that year. William Coulton, of Denton, married Mary Dawson, of Ilkley, in 1680. Rev. John Rhodes, clerk, with Robert Wilkes, as patron, became vicar, and read himself in, Oct. 29, 17 16, when the churchwardens had a frolic after the solemnity, and spent eight shillings, which was duly charged to the parish. There was a very old family of this name, Rhodes, in Menston, and the name occurs in our parish, but we do not know whence Mr. Rhodes came. He was our vicar eleven years, and died suddenly, as we judge, in his fair, full prime, from these entries in the Registers : \u2014 \"July 4, 1726, Isabella, daughter of John Rhodes, vicar, baptized; Jan. 21, 1727, Mercy, daughter of John Rhodes, late vicar, baptized.\" Two very small children the poor mother had to fend for, and if we allow a month between the birth and baptism of the babe, Mercy, she would be born about five months after her father's death, yet the name itself holds a little gleam of light. Mr. Rhodes was also Master of the Grammar School. Thomas Lister, clerk, was appointed Nov. 16, 1727, by Florence Bowles, widow, and he was a man of a fine old stock. His great grand father was a Captain in the great quarrel between the King and the Commons, served under Fairfax, was killed at Tadcaster, and is mentioned in a letter from his Commander as \" Captain William Lister, a valiant and gallant gentleman, who was shot with a musket bullet in v."], [184, "162 ilkley : ancient and modern. the head.\"* His grandfather was also a soldier, serving under Fairfax, rose to the rank of Colonel, and died in his bed at Bradford in 1689-90, aged 60, Foster says, after telling us he was baptized March 25, 16 16. His eldest son, John Lister, of Manningham, was father of our vicar, and nine children beside, and died at 84. Born in the year Cromwell fought the Scotch at Dunbar, and eight years old when the great Protector died, he lived seven years into the reign of George II. Vicar Lister was the eldest son of this fine old gentleman, and served seven years in the little Cure at Burley before he came to Ilkley. The Rev. James Barber, clerk, signs for him in August and December, 1734, and after seven years' vicariate, and probably non-resident, the vicar resigned his living, for what reason we do not know ; and then,t Jan. 16, 1734-5, his Grace of York gave it to Henry Travers, A.B., who held the preferment about a year, after which, on the presentation of Mrs. Florence Bowles, of Richmond, Thomas Lister came back, Jan. 6, 1735-6, held the living again to 1745, and resigned it shortly before his death. He married Mary Bowling, and in due time they had a daughter, Elizabeth, who married Ellis Cunliffe, of Ilkley, Oct. 22, 1738. Of this marriage, Nicholas Cunliffe was born, (whom we elder men very well remember), and Mary, who married John 3Bolling, and Elizabeth, who married John Margerison, so that Vicar Lister was grandfather to Nicholas Cunliffe, and great grand father to the Boilings \u2014 \" Natty,\" Ellis, William, and Lister, who all died unmarried ; and to the Margerisons \u2014 who all went away, save John, who had a drop of the hot blood in him of the old fighting Listers. Vicar Lister died in May, 1745, and was buried on the 19th, in the church ; and his wife was buried 22 days after him. Edmund Beeston, clerk, had been made vicar a few days before the old man's death, April 26, 1745, and was the only home-born man we know of who was ever Vicar of Ilkley. He was the son of Edmund Beeston, husbandman, of Austby, who married Ann Moor for his second wife, and she was the vicar's mother. The family had lived a very long time in Middleton, and this was its century plant that had flowered out, no doubt to their wonder. Having endured there two centuries the vicar ends the line ; that fruitage seems to have slain the tree. Vicar Beeston was a fine classical scholar, was also a man of sterling worth in many ways, and a great friend of the Maudes, of Burley, who had numbered in their family alliances the ejected Vicar of Adel, Mr. Clarkson, and who were intimate with the Archbishop, and in this way may have found some help toward his purpose and preferment. It may be noted also that Mrs. Bowles, the patroness, was the representative of a noted York Puritan clergyman, \u2014 Lord Fairfax's chaplain. \"April 28, 1745.

He held the Cure of Burley also from 1 753 to his death; and, on the resignation of John Becket, in 1758, he became Mas ter of our Gram mar School. He compiled a his tory of the Gram mar School also, from the archives at Weston, and it is stated made a drawing of Ilkley in 1758, ' ' from the north arch under the bridge.\" He married Eliza beth, daughter of George Blan shard, gentle man, of York, who died in Sep tember, 1767; and, March 1 2, 1777, he died also, aged 58, of the strangest of all diseases one can imagine for a farmer's son \u2014 the gout, and March 15, was buried \" in the north aisle of the church, close to the pulpit.\" He had attained the title of B.D. Vicar Beeston also put the ancient vicarage into thorough repair, and built the gable which stands to the street, as seen in our etching. This must have been near the close of his life, for in Vicar Snowdon's time one ancient woman still re membered the restoration, and how Vicar Bees ton gave a house warming, to which the pick of the parish came in their wigs and farthingales, and the little maid who lived to tell the story, saw them standing in great state in the soft candle light as she peeped through the window. The Rev. George Benson was Assistant Curate, 1767, until Mr. Beeston's death. John Chapman, clerk, on the presentation of George Hartley, of Richmond, Esquire, by inheritance from the Bowles, succeeded July 19, 1778, and on the 26th gave his assent and consent to the 39 articles, * The age should have been j5, and the words Exuvi\u00e6 Adj/ciuntur, need this correction."], [186, "164 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. before John Boiling, Joseph Pickard, churchwardens, Wm.

Feb. 1, 1787, he married Elizabeth Clough, an Ilkley woman, who was probably the daughter of William Clough, the parish clerk ; the officiating minister being the Rev. George Benson. In 1801, he resigned the living, and also the curacy of Burley. Rev. George Benson, clerk, was the next vicar, and must have been an old man then, as he was Assistant Curate to Vicar Beeston in 1767, and Curate of Burley, 1778 to 1813, and writes to Michael Stead, of that town, from Ilkley, March 21, 1782, to say he cannot get his chapel rent paid there, and is at his wit's end what to do. Vicar Benson, we judge, was a man of a weak mind. He was lodging with the schoolmaster when Vicar Beeston died in 1777, when that worthy got him to call in the school bond, collect the money, and place it in his hands without the least security, whereby the fund came into sore peril, but was rescued at last by the sub-trustees, and for this, no doubt, and other weaknesses he was lampooned very sore in certain verses \" made \" by an Ilkley woman of no education but of a fine satiric genius. Mr. Benson died in 1813, and Nov. 5, of that year, The Rev. William Holdsworth became vicar. The patron was Leonard Wm. Hartley, Esq., of Middleton Tyas. \" The traditions touching 'Maister Holdsworth' were still fresh and sweet in my boyhood, and his gentle life was the common talk at the fire side. The Methodists and the Catholics liked him, for his heart was great enough to hold them all, and no such gracious days had been known by the ' oldest in habitant ' in Ilkley for quietness and cleanness of life. The Methodists turned in and helped him with his Sunday School, and the Squire sent him game and wine from Stubham to comfort his old body as he toddled down the vale, for he was feeble. And so the good man died, after a service of seventeen years, and he was the last of the vicars who lived and died in the ancient vicarage.\" The \"living\" was augmented in 1807 by a grant of from Queen Anne's Bounty, and in 1815, for restoration purposes, ;\u00a3 1,000 were obtained by lot from the Parlia mentary Grant. The Rev. Joseph Clarke (presented by Mr. George Hartley,) came after Mr. Holdsworth, Oct. 25, 1830, but was never in residence, and the real \" person of the town \" was George Fenton, B.A, who had been curate for a short time for Mr. Holdsworth, and continued to serve in that capacity under the new order. \"Parson Fenton\" was a man well worth his salt. If he had not worn the robes he would easily have passed for a jolly country squire. I can hear his ringing laugh across half a century, and see his ruddy face handsome as \" May.\" The parish for a time did not know what to make of him, no man could be more unlike good old vicar Holdsworth. He would shave on a Sunday morning, and, as he was going to church, had been known to tell the butcher to send up a fine leg of mutton. He had also the curious gift of shedding tears in all sorts of unexpected"], [187, "165 THE church. places while he was preaching, and this was a great marvel to the rustic mind, which was much given for a while to discussing the matter, and usually concluded that \"ther wer nowt to roar at, hawiver.\"* He told his congregation one piping hot Sunday afternoon in the cholera year, that he had lost or forgotten his sermon, and would dismiss them with the benediction, saying with a lovely look of confidence, \"It is no use preaching when you have no sermon. And now, &c.\" The mad caps under age rather looked for some such rare fortune again, but did not get it. Still it was very soon found that this was a man who could do things which sorely needed to be done. The church was still \" In the worst condition of any in the deanery,\" as Dr. Whitaker had said 25 years before, and he went to work at the church. The floor of the church, except in the aisles, was primitive mother earth, he had it well flagged. The ancient oaken benches were full of decay, and a terror to the sitter if he was a man of weight ; he had them taken out and new pews put in of pine, which overcame the old evil odours by its sweet pungency. He had the pulpits brought down to a fair human level for himself and Master Smith, the clerk, and the dial of the old clock painted, and the one pointer it could ever boast gilded, also the initials of the churchwardens for that year were set forth on each corner. He spared the beautiful Watkinson pew, let us thank him for that, and here and there a bit of old work which had in it an antique grace, or the * This word roar means simply to weep : \u2014 \" My bones wax old because of my roaring.\" (Psalm xxxii)."], [188, "166 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. I shadow of a cunning human hand. I think the old clock itself was persuaded to keep decent time in Mr. Fenton's days, and warned against striking when the whim took it, to the bewilderment of half the town, and all the labourers who had no watch. He made the church hold many more people, and had the pews set apart for each person who had a claim, and then he had all this set forth on a big board, with a list of the charities, and placed on the North wall. The church was very ugly, but the days had not come to find that out, and it was, indeed, very comfortable, except for sleeping. He helped to get the first organ. It was made, I think, by Old Ben Whitley, \" all out of his own head,\" a self taught man, who lived on the edge of the moor. Ben was a man of a really fine genius, and could adapt his lissom fingers to carving in oak. There was then a great store of old bedsteads, chairs, and chests (kists) in the parish ; he would buy these for a trifle, carve them most beautifully, and then sell them for a very moderate advance ; and there are a good many things of this sort in the West Riding which pass, no doubt, for choice work of Elizabeth and James' time, for he loved to \" touch up \" the ancient dates. Parson Fenton won the love, at last, of the whole parish for his works' sake, and the people would do anything in the world for him, except \" lend him money.\" Mr. Fenton became Vicar of Royston. He had married a daughter of the Rev. Robert Wilkinson, B.D., Incumbent of Lightcliffe, and Master of Halifax Grammar School. On a stone in Lightcliffe Churchyard is the following inscription : \u2014 \" Underneath this stone are deposited the remains of the Revd. George Fenton, M.A, Vicar of Royston, who died on the 7th day of April, 1843, aged 48 years. Also of his wife, Lydia Fenton, the youngest daughter of the Rev. Robert Wilkinson, B.D., who died on the 24th day of March, 1865, aged 69 years.\" In Ilkley Churchyard, a stone bears the inscription : \u2014 \" Here are deposited the remains of two still born infants, male and female, of Lydia, wife of Rev. George Fenton, B.A, vicar of Royston, Yorks., and many years officiating minister of Ilkley and Denton.\" \" The next curate that I remember was a mere drill sergeant, and was bound to make us all learn the step and march to church, but\u2014 we didn't. \"The next had nothing to say, and said it in the highest key he could reach, without the slightest modulation, or emphasis. I think we should not have minded if he had made the thing musical, but it was good news when we heard he was to leave us, and when old Jo. Smith, the parish clerk, gave notice, that on the next Sunday, Mr. B would preach his funeral sermon. Poor old Joe was turned 80, and would now and then give out the evening hymn in the morning. \" The next who stays in my memory was very ' high ' and very dry, sincere as the day, and full of devotion to his work. But he was fresh from Oxford, full of the new wine which was fermenting there, and did not know the people he had to deal with from a cord of wood. So instead of being all things to us, as Paul directs by inference, he wanted"], [189, "THE CHURCH. 167 us to be all things to him, and especially to attend no end of services on week days, and to fast in Lent. Now Ilkley never did believe in fasting when she could get anything to eat, while very much of her living lay in providing in those times for 'company,' so while the good man wore himself to skin and bone in the weeks before Easter, we quietly voted the whole thing a nuisance, and he left. \" Then a man came of a very lovely spirit and with beautiful gifts as a preacher. Mr. Carrick won the love of all who went to the church, but his health gave out, and he had to move away. Then the old vicar died presently, and a deputation went to Hull to see if the well-loved curate would not accept the living, for, if he would, we would petition the patron to give it to him as the one man we wanted, and even ' ware brass ' some said, to make things smooth. He could not come ; his health was too delicate, and we were feeling bad enough about it when we heard the living had gone to a Mr. Snowdon.\" \u2014 Wharfedale Observer, 1884. The Rev. John Snowdon, A.M., was appointed vicar of Ilkley on the death of Mr. Clarke. His institution is dated August 4th, 1842, and Leonard Lawrie Hartley, Esq., was the patron. Mr. Snowdon was born in 1806, at Dalton Hall, near Seaham, Durham. He was educated at Houghton-le-Spring, and graduated at St. John's College, Cambridge ; became B.A. in 1828, M.A. in 1836; curate of Sockburn, in Durham, 1829; of Grindon in 1831 ; Crosby Garrett in 1833 ; Stockton-on-Tees in 1834; Greatham in 1836; Middleton Tyas about 1840, which he relinquished to become vicar of Ilkley. Mr. Snowdon married Margaret, daughter of Mr. Jasper Whitfield, at Stockton, in 1840, and on settling here had then one child. The old vicarage in Church Street was so ruinous that he rented a house in Wells Road, owned (and occupied until recently) by Miss Batty. Mr. Clarke's executors had to pay for dilapidation of the old vicarage. A few years afterwards a new parsonage was built on the glebe land, a little higher up than the temporary residence, the cost being jointly defrayed by a grant from Queen Anne's Bounty and the vicar's large donation. The new- vicarage became occupied in 1848. \"He had to root out certain im- memorial squatters when he began to build the new parsonage. They went far and wide telling of their woes at having to leave 't' owd thak,' but he found them better quarters and paid the bills. He had a touch of humour also, which stood him in good stead and acted as a buffer to the little shocks that came to him in these first years from all sides. Master Hobson, parish clerk, poet, and bachelor of fifty, was for ever falling over head and ears in love, but never told his love, finding vent enough, to all seeming, by telling me and old Ben Whitley, and by reading the verses, I would sometimes help him to tinker, to his last and loveliest divinity. One Sunday as he rose to give out the hymn, the latest-up-to-date shot a glance at him out of her great blue eyes, least wise he thought so, and so instead of giving out \u2014 ' As when the weary traveller gains, &c,'"], [190, "168 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. he got off two lines from the ' poem ' which was singing itself in his comical old head. I saw the blunder and might have fainted if I had known how. Mr. Snowdon saw it too, and there was a slight rustle and a look on his face, as when a shadow sweeps across the ripe grain. Master Hobson saw it, and managed to make it look like a prelude to his ' weary traveller.' Then the sunshine caught the vicar's face and he settled back in his seat, nor did he ever say a word about it to Master Hobson, and so I guess I am the sole depository now of the secret, as the blue eyes caught shame from another direction, and then closed.\" In 1853, Mrs. Snowdon, who was endeared to all the parishioners, died, leaving four sons and three daughters. A stained window, on the North-east of the chancel, was erected to her memory. The population having increased six-fold, a portion of the parish was allotted to the Incumbent-designate of St. Margaret's, which was built near the Wells House. Mr. Snowdon was a prime mover in the erection of the Ilkley Charity Hospital, and for many years its secretary. The parish church was restored and enlarged at a cost of .\u00a31,300, the wall of the South aisle, the tower, and the pillars of the nave were alone left standing. The \"faculty\" bears date May 31, 1860. During the ten months of these operations, service was held in the old Grammar School. The church was re-opened by the Lord Bishop of Ripon, May 6th, 1 86 1, and the total cost raised before the close ofthe re-opening day. A new organ was added in 1862, at the sole expense of an anonymous parishioner. National Schools were next erected, when the vicar was ably assisted by his curate, the Rev. C. R. Green, afterwards vicar of Rokeby. In 1844, there were only three bells in the tower, bearing inscriptions as follows: (1) In jucunditate soni, sonabo. 1609. (2) Soli Deo Gloria. 1636. (3) Gloria in excelsis. 1676. The first and second were cracked. These three were re-cast into six, and first rung for service on Sunday, January nth, 1846.

Mr. Snowdon introduced Mercer's Hymns, which, after considerable hesitation, he withdrew for Monk's Hymns Ancient and Modern at the request of the choir. Church rates, as in most parishes, caused many contentions, but the vicar calmly accepted defeat. For many years he conducted services at Nesfield, and also at Langbar, ably supported by Mr. J. B. Popplewell, of Beacon Hill. In 1870, on returning home from one of these services late, having waited for the moon to rise, he slipped on the ice, and fractured a small ankle bone. He crawled about a quarter of a mile to the nearest house, a cab was sent for, and he reached home about two o'clock a.m. For some time he had suffered from rheumatism in the knee joint, and was generally helped upstairs by his daughter, but unfortunately he ventured alone Feb. 5th, 1878, and, his stick failing him, he fell down from the topmost flight as he was retiring to bed. Dr. Call was speedily summoned, but the good old vicar succumbed on the 8th, at the age of 7 2 years, the second death in the new vicarage. At the funeral, the Rev. T. M. Theed, formerly curate, read the lesson, and the Rev. Canon Jackson read the prayers. He was buried near the vestry door. On a large slab are three slightly raised tablets, bearing inscriptions to \"Mrs. Snowdon, born 1815, died 1853;\" \"John Snow don, M.A, Cantab., born Feb. 6th, 1806, died Feb. 8th, 1878, Vicar of Ilkley for 36 years;\" and \"Elizabeth, their eldest child, born 1840, died 1844.\" The family placed a stained glass window in the church to his memory. Many tributes were offered to his memory. \" Quiet, as all strong men are, catholic, as all good men are, standing close to his convictions, as all true men do, it is no wonder that in these thirty six years he should win Churchmen and Dissenters to love him in life, and think of him very tenderly now he is dead. The parish should print a memoir of him, and prefix a portrait.\" The Rev. W. Danks, of St Margaret's, said \u2014 \" Anyone more gentle, more genial, more cour teous, self-forgetful, it has never been my lot to meet. You may have vicars more energetic, but you will never see one wiser.\" The Rev. S. D. Hillman, Congregationalist, touchingly referred to the death of the vicar. The Wharfedale papers devoted several columns to his memory. The Rev. Arthur Cleveland Downer, M.A is the worthy suc cessor to Mr. Snowdon. His institution bears date Sept. 19th, 1878, on the nomination of the Bishop of Ripon, by lapse. In the compilation of this volume, Mr. Downer has taken great interest, and afforded un bounded facilities in searching the Parish Registers. No one can be more deeply interested than he is in a desire to garner the antiquities of Ilkley, and it is to bs hoped the project he has several times advocated, of founding a local museum, may be speedily accomplished. His interest in the prosperity of the town, the spiritual and social welfare of the inhabitants, the education of the rising generation, and every item that falls to the lot of the vicar, is matter for present thankfulness and future eulogium. The energetic and the wise are combined. w."], [194, "ilkley : ancient and modern. 170 Having lingered so long on the story of our vicars, we will leisurely stroll in and around the sacred edifice, wherein have gathered successive generations to worship God, to hear Mass, attend weddings, baptisms, and funerals, some even to do penance ; the morality of the parish has been more or less cabled to this pulpit. Various have been the scenes at the religious observances. The Latin Service Books, the first printed Bible, the Reformation, the Puritan struggle, new Quaker doctrines, Methodism, and a hundred other topics centre here. It is the history of the people for centuries, probably thirteen in number; reckoning idolatry sixteen in number. The dust is precious, containing the accu mulation of fifty generations. One is surprised how little ground there is on the favourite South side of the church, and where so many genera tions could find space for interment. The North side, formerly devoted to the unbaptized, and heretic, and suicide, was out of the question. The sparsity of old gravestones is very noteworthy, but now that the foolish North-side superstition has died away, we find there a large num ber of beautiful monuments, some to the memory of visitors who have died at the Hydropathic Establishments. \"Sarah, widow of Richard Moulson, Esq., M.D., of Halifax, d.

The slab was taken to Myddelton Lodge. The only lettering that can be made out is : \u2014 \" The chelder [of] John [surname gone] the [of De] cember m ccccc. 1.

Formerly, the walls were decorated with scroll-work and passages of Scripture. \"Ben Whit ley's organ\" gave place to a sweet -toned one in 1862, erected by Brindley, of Sheffield. For the Roman and Saxon remains in and about the church, the reader is re ferred to Chap- tersll. andlll. A further res- toration of the interior of the church took place in No- vember, 1880, and a new ves- try was subse- quently added. The plaster was removed from the walls and roof, and the stones were pointed, the old irregular ma- sonry producing a quaint appearance. The end of a former nave wall was discovered by this clearance, new clerestory windows were intro duced on the North side, and great improvements made in the lighting and warming of the edifice. In August, 1884, before a large gathering of the members of the Yorkshire Ar ch\u00e6ological As sociation, the Rev. A . C . Downer read a brief paper, from which we cull the follow- ing notes, and would es pecially urge attention to the founding of a local museum : \" It is with sincere pleasure that I welcome you to a spot so rich in histori cal remains as Ilkley. The field to the North of the churchyard is probably virgin soil so far as discoveries of this kind are concerned, and it would be a work worthy of the Association to undertake, with the owner's permission, to search it. From time to"], [198, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 174 time many antiquities have been found, either in the churchyard or in other parts of Ilkley; but many of them in past years were carried ort by visitors, who purchased them from workmen and others. It is to De hoped that a more enlightened spirit is now prevalent, and that tor the future Ilkley will retain its own treasures. It would be a very satis factory result of the visit of this Association if a local museum were established in which such remains as may be recovered might be pre served and future discoveries collected. The church and churchyard are particularly rich in these, as it will be known to those present that they occupy the site of the ancient Roman fortress. Coins, pottery, and other articles have been found from time to time in digging graves, and I have a few of these in my possession. The tower was no doubt constructed of the stones of the fortress, as is evidenced by the sculptures still to be seen on the North side of the interior. It was always a puzzle to me when I first came to Ilkley why the arch of the tower was not in the middle, and this was not cleared up until the restoration in 1880, when the plaster was stripped from the walls. It then appeared that the original nave wall and clerestory on the South side sprang from the arch as that on the North side, as anyone can see for himself now that the stones are exposed, but that at some period, no doubt in consequence of the growing requirements of the place, it had been put back to its present position, and possibly the South aisle added. If this is the case, the church would probably at that time be only one-third of its present size. In connection with the tower there is a niche at the South- east corner of the exterior, above the roof, the object of which I am unable to explain. [It seems too high for the effigy of a Saint.] On the North side of the nave there is a very curious old capital, which appears to be of earlier date than the rest. The two floriated capitals, North and South, at the East end of the nave are modern, being put in at the restoration in 1861. I believe that Eastward from these pillars the chancel was entirely re-built. The chancel is therefore new and enlarged, and consequently does not call for special remark. The North aisle bears evident tokens osage, and I should say is, next to the door, the oldest portion of the church. There is, however, nothing in it to equal the South doorway, which is a fine specimen of the Norman style, consisting of a pointed arch, with double row of tooth-work ornamentation, and rounded shafts. The plinth has been restored. Pieces of stone, similarly marked to the crosses, are seen in the window of the South aisle, and another rather different, now in the vestry, was taken from the clerestory when the windows were made there in 1880. A piece of a different pattern, yet in which the convolutions interlace, has been taken to Middleton. In the North wall of the chancel is a stone with an incised plain cross upon it, and was either a stone coffin or a very rough gravestone. [From the position, we suppose this to be a memorial of one of the founder's or impropriator's family.] There are two piscin\u00e6, a new one marking the site of the old chantry, and the old one removed from that place to the chancel, with what object I cannot say.\" The Parish Registers are described in the chapter on the Town's Books."], [199, "chapter xi.\u2014 xibe Grammar Scbool HE Grammar School was founded on a legacy of one hundred pounds, left by George Marshall, of Ilkley, \" to be employed to some godly and charitable use.\" He was living in Ilkley in 1589, when he was summoned before the Manor Court, and fined 3s. 4d. for a rescue from the Bailiff of \" A maide of Parish Wieff daughter,\" a bit of pure chivalry, let us believe, in despite of the judgment of the Court. His business is not men- tioned in any paper we have seen ; but he was in the habit of lending out small sums of money for due interest, and on good security, and was worth, when he died, 13s. 4. in money and goods. He died in 1600, having made his will, and named Thomas Mawde, gentleman, George Snell, the vicar, John Lodge, and John Wayt, as his executors and residuary legatees. His funeral expenses, and the probate of the will, came to \u00a313, and fifty pounds were given to his poor relations and friends. These sums, and the \u00a3 100 before-named paid and done with, the rest of the estate was to be divided among the executors, share and share alike. We do not make out the fact clearly that Marshall named the exact purpose in his will for which the was left, but it is evident he had spoken about a school to his friends, and so within a year it was quite under stood in the parish that this was to be its destination. It is evident also that there was a school already in the town, taught by one William Lobley, on such terms as he could make ; but the \" godly and charitable use \" of Marshall's money did not reach Lobley for many a day. The executors began to fall out instantly about their shares in the estate. Thomas Maude, gent., had the most of it in his hands, they said, and evidently believed in the nineteen points of the law. So there was much bad blood among them, and fending and proving, which only made matters worse. In September, 1601, they agreed to submit the question to Christopher Boynton and John Metcalf, both of Ilkley, for arbitration, choosing Sir Thomas Fairfax, of Denton, and Sir Mauger Vavasore, of Weston, as umpires. In September, 1603, these gentlemen were ready to report. ;\u00a3ioo must be paid out of the estate before the"], [200, "176 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. ioth of May ensuing, into the hands of William Middleton, Esq., of Stockill, and Anthony Maude, gentleman, of Helthwayt Hill, for found ing a Grammar School ; out on bonds, should be called in, and the rest should be paid by the executors out of the money then in their hands, each having more than double the amount of the award in his THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL. hands already, and the executors were also ordered not to touch any thing more George Marshall had left, until this business was settled, and the money paid. j\" |In 1607-8 we find that the executors have not only failed to meet the award, but have been before his Majesty's President and Council of the North, and before Baron Savile, with their quarrel.

Fairfax and Vavasour were oiled in again by all the parties interested, and an agreement made to stand by their award, which is signed by Edward Fairfax, the poet, and others. So a second award was made by these faithful and most patient knights, which we may sum up thus : 1. Stop all this fighting. 2. The hundred pounds we want is now in the estate of Maude at 10 per cent, interest ; it must be paid by the 29th of September ; there is plenty of property, we have found that out; let Anthony Maude see to it. 3. We will take the money and put it out at 10 per cent. ; Maude may have it one year longer, if he will pay that interest and give us good security. 4. We will pay the ten pounds to a schoolmaster to be elected by the Archbishop, and by us and our heirs, and the Vicar of Ilkley may be the schoolmaster also, if he is found fit for the place. 5. Back pay is due, amounting to \u00a315, to the estate of the late Wil liam Lobley, schoolmaster ; it must be paid at Michaelmas ; then Anthony Maude may have to make his portion equal, out of what remains. 6. The whole business shall be settled in the parish church of Ilkley, on the feast of the Purification of Our Lady, 1607. Done on this 25th of May : Signed \u2014 Thomas Fairfax, Mauger Vavasour. There is vastly more of it than we can find room for, but this is the kernel. Poor John Wayt, yeoman, meanwhile was ruined by the suits that had risen, but was bound to answer to his bond while the Maude estate had got the money, and this would crush him utterly. So he petitioned Lord Sheffield to be released from his bond, and as it was evident that he had acted during these seven troubled years with perfect honesty, the release was granted during the summer of this year. In 1634, we find that the Marshalls have moved to Idle and Shipley, and have in their possession \u00a3$2 of the school money, and this they are ordered to pay \" at Denton Hall, within the county of York, be tween the hours of six o'clock in the forenoon, and four in the aster noon on the Sth day of October next coming.\" In 1635, we find there was still no Grammar School, and that the fund was impaired, so a meeting was called, with this result : \"Ilkley, Jan. 2, 1635. By general consent of the inhabitants of Ilkley, we, whose names are here subscribed, do undertake to pay our proportion toward the erection of a school house.

In 167 1 part of the money is in the hands of Mrs. Katharine Middleton, of Stockeld, but how much does not appear. In 1696, Reginald Heber, of the Inner Temple, London, left to the church and school of Ilkley, as follows:\u2014 ii Item \u2014I give unto the Church at Ilkley one hundred pounds to be laid out in lands, and I will that the vicar for the time being may receive the benefits and increase thereof.\" \" Item \u2014I give and bequeath to the school there, where I gott my learning, one hundred pounds to bee likewise laid out in lands, to the intent that the schoolmaster for the time being may receive the interest and benefits thereof, both before and after the same shall be laid out in lands Upon Condition and soe as the said master doe and shall teach and instruct all the male children within the said parish of Ilkley gratis which shall come to be taught and instructed by him.\" The ability of the estate to pay this legacy with all other claims in tull was doubted at first, but by 1701 the money was paid, and with \u00a316 is 6d. then in the hands of the school trustees, was invested in lands in Netherdale, by Wilfrid Lawson, Richard Witton, John Heber, Edward Boiling, William Currer, Peter Parkinson, and Thomas Bartlett. The property was owned by Mary Johnson, spinster, daughter of Alderman Johnson, of Hull, and was really a great bargain. In 1770, one hundred pounds ofthe school money was lent, at 4 % per cent., to Joseph Pollard, of Fairweather Green, a descendant, we believe, of the worthy blacksmith who helped to build the school house, and this was the money vicar Benson, who was then curate, called in, which came near being lost. Beside all this, in 16\u2014, Richard Middleton gave 40s. toward the school house, and William Currer toward the school funds, and, in 1691, 2s. 8d. was paid for mossing the back of the school, and five pence for the moss. Mr. Wright, a curate in 1692, was sub-schoolmaster. Probably other curates served the same office. The vicar makes the following entry, Jan. 18th, 1686:\u2014 \"Paid to Mr. Knipe the schoolmaster, \u00a32 5s. od. which is to be repaid to me when the rents come due. Witness my hand, William Hustler.\" Under date 1687, we meet with a copy of the will of Alderman Thomas Johnson, of Hull, who figures largely in the so-called Johnson MSS., or Hull Celebrities (printed by Mr. Gun- nell, which are so tasty that they ought to be true), the former owner of the Ilkley Charity lands at Bewerley.

The Parish Register contains the following memorandum concerning Ilkley School : \u2014 The Patronage of the ffree school of Ilkley was and is vested in the Archbishop of York and his successors, and the Fairfaxes of Denton and the Vavasours of Weston, and their heirs for ever, and upon every vacancy the Vicar of Ilkley shall have the preference to all other candidates. The said School is moreover a Grammar School. This is agreeable to a deed in the possession of Walter Vavasour, Esq., of Weston. Witness our hands, Edmd. Beeston, Vicar, 6 April, 1758.

In 1762, Edmund Beeston, vicar and schoolmaster, William Boiling, Nicholas Cunliffe and Ellis Cunliffe, of Ilkley, and William Watson, of Woodhouse, yeomen, trustees of the lands at Bewerley, belonging to the church and school, leased the same to Ralph Frear. In 1778, April 6th, a certificate was granted to Thomas Beanlands of conforma- tion and subscription, on his appointment to the mastership of the school. Ten years afterwards he gives a bond, as master of the school, to the Rt. Rev. William, Archbishop of York, the Rt. Hon. Thomas Lord Fairfax, Baron of Cameron, and Edward Vavasour, of Weston, Esquire, Trustees of Ilkley School ; the interest to be paid to the mas- ter. Witness \u2014 G. Benson. Lawton records that \" the master shall teach and instruct all the male children within the parish gratis.

In the first book the baptisms average about 23 yearly j from 16 in 1629, to 34 in 1646. In the first year of the register four of the fourteen children baptized were illegitimate. The weddings vary from"], [207, "183 THE PARISH BOOKS. 2 to 9 per annum ; about five on the average. The burials run from 9 in 1618 to 30 in 1640 ; average about 18. Dr. Whitaker states 25 as the number for 1600, whereas the number was 14. From 1656 to 1673 the book is defective. The second volume in the 181 3 list has been found, more or less perfect, in loose leaves, at Mr. Joseph Beanlands', who allowed us to copy it. Mr. Beanlands had probably acquired it from some member of his family, several of whom have held public offices. We hope he will have it bound, in consideration of the long use they have had of the contents, and that it may be speedily restored to its proper quarters. On one page is the following entry\u2014\" In Court at Bingley, April, 1725. This Register Booke and the three leases following were shewed to Benj. Beanlands at the time of his examination on the Defts. part before us, J. Holmes, Robert Butler, William Lepton.\" [It will be a thousand pities if any mishap arises to these fragmentary pages, and we hope Mr. Beanlands will not bear the responsibility any longer than he can help. The fact that I have a copy strongly urges me to its publication here, but space forbids, and it will afford me a relief to hear of the restoration of the volume, and the town will be equally grateful. \u2014 J. H. T.] The third volume contains the baptisms and burials from 1690 to 181 2, the marriages from 1691 to 1754. There are some leaves con taining baptisms, 1682-5, which seemingly belong to the unbound second volume. The third volume opens with memoranda on the list of books in 1813 ; the numbers polled at the 1807 election by Wilber force, Milton, and Lascelles ; a list of rectors and vicars, evidently from Dr. Whitaker's Craven ; notes on the Rectory ; and an extract from Otley Parish Register on the 1673 flood. In the time of William III. duty was paid upon the number of entries in the registers. A Stamp Act existed from 1783 to 1794, after which it was repealed. A fourth volume records the banns and marriages after 1754, consequent on the passing of Lord Hardwick's Marriage Act, in 1753. In 1752, it was enacted by Parliament that the year should be reckoned from January ist, and the registers at Ilkley, hitherto commencing the year with March 25th, now began with January ist, but in 1755 \u2014 \"By direction of ye Court,\" they begin again with Lady Day, and so continued until 1781. From 1745 the vicars annually sign the registers. Transcripts were sent to York each year. Dr. Whitaker gives 2 1 as the number of baptisms in 1700, but this is much above the average. They run about 15 per year, and the population seems almost at a standstill from 1700 to 1800, probably owing to the blotting out of small holdings, and emigration to manufacturing towns. Amongst the strangers baptized at Ilkley were, John, son of John Daniel, Mr. Coulthurst's servant, of Gargrave, 1767; and Thomas, son of Thomas Cane, of Warrington, tinker, 1776. About this time an improved system of registration was advocated in Leeds district, and its utility may be judged from the following excerpts from Ilkley registers: \u2014 \"1777 \u2014 John s. Joseph Nowell, of Holling Hall, son to Stephen Nowell, of Embsay. Grace d."], [208, "184 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. Wm.

Neriah Story, Leeds, and Elizabeth Heber were married in 1699; William Rawson, Shipley, and Frances Oates, Wheatley, in 1723. The burials vary considerably, from 4 in 1707, 8 in 1713, 10 in 1715, 14 in 1750, 6 in 1751, to 16 in 1753. In 1775 there were 21 burials.

We have to guess at them through such items as the payment to the ringers on the 5 th of November and the 29th of May. There is not the slightest hint beyond this bell ringing for the escape of his majesty from his hunters, of the awful struggle between the parliament and the throne, though Denton, just down the river, was one of the grand strongholds of the \" Roundheads \" in Yorkshire. Ilkley seems to have lain low in her nest, listening to the boom of the cannon but a few miles away, while the smoke of battle could be seen from the crests of the moors. The Middletons leapt into the fight on one side, and the Hebers on the other, but no record we can lay our hands on now gives us the slightest hint that the humbler folk took any such part in the fray as was taken by their brethren all about. One has to fear, indeed, that they took a mean comfort in the words they would hear now and then in the old church, \" A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand, but it shall not come nigh thee,\" and to wonder what has become of the bright strong manhood of the farmstead and cottage, which insisted for centuries on having green yew for bows, no matter about the penalty, and mustering with them at the Golden Butts for archery. Ilkley, to be sure, lay apart from the fervid life that was flashing into strong fires of resistance to the Crown. The great road up the dale lay North of the river. There is a tradition that Cromwell rode through the town on his way to Preston. We had nothing on our"], [216, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 192 side the river but some sort of wretched trackway indicated on the maps of the time by a faint dotted line, and this lay through woods so dense that old people used to say a squirrel could leap from tree to tree between Burley and Otley town end and never touch the ground. Ilkley is not once mentioned in the Fairfax Letters, or in the reports of the outrages perpetrated by the troops on both sides. Rupert came down with his army in 1644, on his way to Marston Moor, but he kept on the North side of the river to Denton, and staying there all night, was tempted to burn the \" strong and stately pile,\" but held his hand for the sake of an old comrade of the Fairfax blood, whose portrait hung in \" the great parlour ; \" and so its doom was to be burnt finally by a careless maid who was picking feathers. There is one very dim tradition of a raid usually credited 50 years ago to 1745, but quite impossible under that date, as there is no grain of evidence the red shanks ever got so near us. It turns on one haver cake Dame Oddy saved, by clapping it under her babe in the cradle, when the raiders came and made a clean sweep of all the eatables in the town beside, and no doubt all the drink they could carry away. The family was in the parish when that century came in, and is still to the fore. It is the sole tradition of any trouble we fell on in that troubled time. Fragmentary Notes. \u2014 Some fragments remain also of this century not to be found. in the Town's Books. In 1601 we find \"An Indenture of the apprenticeship of Walter Pollard, of Otley, by consent of his father, to Thomas Shawe, of Ilkley, smythe, for 7 years for meat and drink, and instead of lynen or woollen the last 5 years, us., 13s., 15s., and 20s. respectively.\" This paper is interesting for the revelation it makes of the difference in the terms of apprenticeship between the reigns of Elizabeth and Victoria. The writer was bound to a successor of Master Shawe, 237 years after the date of Pollard's indenture, but the terms by this time were meat and drink and coarse shirts and leathern aprons, so the terms of the old time would have seemed like a small fortune, allowing for the difference in the value of money. 1608, 4th James, June 30th. Know all men by these presents that I William Crommocke of Ilekeleigh, yeoman, let to Walter Pollard, blacksmith, of Ilekeleigh, the cottage where he now dwelleth, with garden, orchyearde, and p'cell called Yewcrofte, Beckehill, and p'cell of arable lands called Kell with sufficient freedom on the moor or common, and sufficient turbaire, for xxi years. 13th James, ffab. 18th, William Cromacke and Gilford Cromacke of Ilkley, yeomen, lease to James Hudson, yeoman, lands east of the beck in William Cromeck's beck close, for 21 years at id. per annum, if demanded; released, 1621, to Walter Pollard, blacksmith : Witnesses, William Longfellow, Lyonel Lyster. In 1633, indenture states that Elizabeth Sheafelde, widow, and Walter Pollard, blacksmith, with the consent of Sir Peter Middelton, of Stockeld, Knt., let four cowgates for \u00a38. Walter Pollard did well in every way, got hold of the land between the"], [217, "THE PARISH BOOKS. 193 Churchyard and the river, and gave his name to the well called Canker Well now, but \" Pollard Well\" within our day, when it gushed out from the scarp of the old Foss among the great plane trees. He could not write his name, but came forward with his mark to build the school and help to pay for it, and raised a son who at his death, in 1674, is styled \" \u00c6dituus,\" but his grandson went astray with the bad Heber in that burglary, and seems to have been a fool as well as a rogue. The records of the Sedbergh School property, covering this time and lapping over, give us some insight into the letting of land. \"By Letters Patent of 14th May, 155 1, Edward VI. granted to the twelve Governors of the School of Sedbergh the whole late chantry of St. Nicholas, in Ilkley, with all its rights, &c, the lands known by the names of Backston, Beck-Lees, Edes, Longlands, &c.\" 1589. \u2014 A Lease for 22 years was granted to Robert Cowghyll, butcher, and Richard Gybsone, farmer, at Ilkley, of dwelling-house, barne, East close, 4 acres \u2014 Syke close, j4 acre \u2014 wheat hags, 1 rood \u2014 and Byndyng Holme, 3 acres \u2014 at one mark yearly rent. 1 68 1. \u2014 Three farms at Ilkley, late Joseph Watkinson's, advanced from \u00a31 8s. 8d. to and fine ; a farm, late William Squiers, advanced from ios. 4d. to \u00a32 ios., and^io fine ; a farm at Ilkley, late Henry Currer's and heretofore Cowgill's, advanced from 13s. 4d. to \u00a34 15s., and fine; a farm at Ilkley, late William Sheffield's, advanced from us. 8d. to \u00a33 ios., and \u00a325 fine; a farm at Ilkley, late Nicholas Stead's, advanced from 19s. 8d. to \u00a36, and \u00a335 fine. 1702. \u2014 Mr. Barker's \u00a32 15s., fine \u00a325; Mr. John Mawson's^3 15s., fine ; John Brogden's \u00a34 15s., fine ; Roger Coates' \u00a36, fine 1706. \u2014 Thomas Barker's \u00a32 15s., fine \u00a325 ; Edward Boiling's \u00a3g, fine ;\u00a3ioo; Roger Coates' \u00a36, fine John Mawson's \u00a33 15s., fine \u00a34 4s. 6d. 1785. \u2014 These farms were fixed as follows: \u2014 Boiling's ; Harrison's fine John Brogden's fine \u00a3to; Lofthouse's rent \u00a34 6s., fine ;\u00a38o; Robert Brogden's rent \u00a3(., fine \u00a380.* A deed of 1685 gives us a glimpse of the terms on which the lord of the manor let his lands : \u2014 John Middleton, Esq., of Stockeld, leases to Edward Beanlands, of Ilkley, tanner, Hew- crofts, Westholm, Ealands, and five old Yeates in the Cow Close at \u00a3.(> per annum, with two fatt capons; tenant to grind his corn at the water corn mill in Ilkley. Those who stood by the ancient church had to bear such penalties as might be laid on them. They would not be so hard to bear in our quiet corner, where the great family, which held to the old ways, was master of the situation, as in some districts. 1603. \u2014 Ilkley Recusants : \u2014 \" Cycalye Wright wedow, Elizabeth Wright, daughter to ye said Cycly, recusants 10 monethes; Meriall Hardwick * \" Platt's Sedbergh,\" privately printed.

NE of the families now quite forgotten was the Waytes. Le Wayt is the old English for the constable and bailiff of a town, and this, no doubt, is the origin of the name in Ilkley. We find Thomas le Wayt as early as 1369. In 1378 the prefix is dropped, the old constable is dead, but Thomas and Robert Wayt make good the name, and Thomas is a married man. In 1400, Thomas holds lands in Stubbyng and Bailecroft \u2014 that is, 1 the constable's croft \u2014 but Nicholas has taken his place in 141 3, and can hardly be a constable || because he is among a number the constable has been waiting and watching for; he is also a tenant at will. We can trace the name then under various mis-spellings to 1594, when Thomas Wayt is a free tenant holding lands of his own in Middleton, and entitled by his dignity to sit next to the lord of the manor, the only man in Middleton of that rank. In 1598, the old saw is suggested, that weddings, like troubles, never come single, for Frances Wayt marries Thomas Smyth, old John Wayt, Grace Ramsgill, and his son John, Isabella Robynson, all in what we trust they would call \" the same blessed year.\" John Wayte, senior, was made trustee under the will of George Marshall ; he was a yeoman, with land of his own, but the contentions and suits raised by the will ruined the old man, and he had to petition Lord Sheffield, as we have seen, for protection, which was granted in 1607, and he was still alive in 1614. His son John is helping to take care of the school funds in 1634, and in 1635, another son, Laurence, signs the agreement to build the new school-house and pay the bills. But the family cannot recover from the loss which came on old John in fighting for the endowment, John and Laurence are tenant-farmers in a small way, and a few years later, John, who has been overseer in his time, takes a dole, yet we must remind our readers here, that this was never a disgrace in Ilkley, for the money was left for the proud, striving poor, who would rather die than go on the parish, and such poor took it without the least hesitation within these 40 years, and may do this still. We find them living in Middleton down"], [225, "FAMILIES. 201 to 1688, and then we miss them. We can trace them through 320 years. Their life and fortune is hidden away in the school fund and the school, a good brave life. The Cromacks belong also to these forgotten families. They appear first in 1443, and it is clear they have hot blood in them, for they are often haled into the court to answer for \" drawing blood,\" and for taking the lord's green wood to make them bows. They are tenants at will, when we first light on them, but rise in the world, and by 1523 have a freehold of under in Ilkley, for which Thomas Cromack pays i2d. to Henry VIII. to carry on the war against the French. Robert Cromack inherits from Thomas, and then we find it is a messuage of 1 2 acres they hold in Ilkley. Then Thomas Cromack his son rises to the dignity of a will, and an inquisition touching the tenure of his lands in Ilkley, when he dies in 1590. In the year before his death Constantine Cromack is the man we heard of who may claim 6s. \"if he can find out whose cattel eat his corn.\" Old Costin Crowmock, Crumhock, or Crombeck, which may give us crooked beck as the meaning of the name, died in 1604. In 1608, we are able to locate some of the Cromack lands, a cottage with garden and orchard, a parcel called Yew Croft, Beckhill, and Kell. These William rents on a lease of 2 1 years. William and his brother Gilford lease Beck Close also in 1616, for 21 years, this Beck Close lying on the East side of the beck : the terms are id. a year, and a certain sum down. William died in 1631, Bryan also died about that time and left \u00a34 to the poor, and Ann, his wife, left \u00a33 to the poor. After this we find them in Hangingstone, where, in 1731, William Cromack lost his son John. The old man probably removed to Silsden then, and died there in 1741 ; but a woman of the name is living in Middleton as late as 1767 when she \" has a misfortune.\" We trace this forgotten family through 324 years. It is full of life and reaming over with mischief in the earlier generations, rises to the rank of yeoman, and holds its own on the crown of the causeway for a century, then begins to decline and vanishes out of sight, but if that seven pounds has not been \"lost\" there is still a hand reaching out from these warm-hearted and mischief-loving Cromacks to help some poor body in Ilkley through a hard winter. A branch of the family settled in Idel, one of whom was seven feet high, and his grandmother reached her hundredth year. Another family which lingered in Ilkley down to our time and has won both fame and fortune was that of the Cunliffes. John Cunliffe, of Wycollar, in Lancashire, who lived to be 93, had three sons and three daughters. Nicholas was the second son, and came to live at Ilkley in 1695, while his brother Ellis became chaplain to Charles IL, and got some good livings into the bargain. Nicholas married Elizabeth Foster, of Airton, in Malhamdale, and got a fortune with her; also copyhold lands at Ickonhirst from a namesake at Haslingden, failing heirs male to his brother, John Cunliffe, of Wakefield. His will, proved 1725, is at York. Three sons were born of this marriage, John, of Wycollar, who married AI."], [226, "202 ILKLEY 3 ANCIENT AND MODERN. Dorothy Wood, of Barnsley, Nicholas, who was born in Ilkley and baptized Jan. 13, 1703, was a wool-comber and yeoman, and died in 1771, and Ellis, of Ilkley and Addingham, who married Elizabeth Lister, our vicar's daughter. Nicholas was twice married, the first wife dying in 1734, and the second in 1769. His first child, Mary, born in 1726, died in the same year. The second, Elizabeth, born in 1727, died in 1732. The third was a son, Nicholas, he was born in 1729, lived in Addingham, was a master wool-comber, died in 1793, and was buried, the books say, in the South aisle of Ilkley Church. Ann was the next, born in 1733, she died in 1737. These were to the first marriage. By the second marriage we find Ellis, who went also into the wool combing; he was born in 1738. Then there is another Mary, born in 1739, who died in 1746. Ann \u2014 second \u2014 born in 1741, married Jonathan Butler, of Ashton-under-Lyne, in 1761. Henry, born in 1742, married Martha Hawksworth in 1770, and lost her the next year. John, born in 1744, followed the wool-combing, and died in 1797. Joseph, born in 1747, kept a shop in Ilkley, and had a son born to him when he was 20 years of age. Then another Elizabeth was born in 1748, William, in 1750, and a third Mary in 1753, also Phcebe, Martha, and Ellen, making, if we have got the true list, sixteen children, and of these we have no further account to give. Ellis Cunliffe, son-in-law of vicar Lister, was father of John Cunliffe, of Addingham, who was born in 1742, married Mary, only daughter of the Rev. W. Thompson, of Addingham, in 1772, and died in 1813. He was the father of Ellis Cunliffe Lister Kaye, who was M.P. for Bradford and a large landowner in our parish. Lister, born in 1747, died of a fever in 1778, and was buried in the middle aisle of the church, near the pulpit; he was a stuff-maker and farmer. Then Ellis, born in 1751, died in 1757, and Nicholas, born in 1757, was a yeoman of the old splendid type. He must have stood six feet two in his stockings when he was in his prime, and was broad and brawny in rjroportion to his height. He lived all his life and died in, or rather was buried from, the old house at the foot of Church Street, as one turns down the Bridge Lane. He was 90 when he died and might have lived longer but was knocked over by a \"stirk\" he was turning, was brought home dead, buried in the North aisle of the church, and the strongest young fellows in the town were selected to bear him to his burial, for he was of immense weight, and we got 4s. 6d. each for our service. \" Old Nicholas \" was fond of standing for a chat with the young men almost to the last, and his talk was then steeped in the rough and racy vernacular of the dale, but when one went to see him as he sat in his little old parlour he put aside his \" town gate \" speech and held himself to a very charming old-world courtesy. The family under this name lived among us 152 years and did something for the poor little industries ofthe town in the shape of wool-combing and spinning. I think they built the mill also which stood down to our time where the splendid Ilkley Wells House stands now, but had been long silent and turned into cheap"], [227, "FAMILIES. 203 CUNLIFFE PEDIGREE.\u2014 Robert Cunliffe, of Hollins, in Lancashire.

See under\u2014 Sedbergh School Estate, postea. The Bollings.\u2014 Robert Boiling, of Boiling, whose will is dated 1487, held lands at Hethlee. The Bollings are well remembered in Ilkley, they came from Chellow and Boiling, by Bradford, about 1690, when we find Edward Boiling, gent., living in our town, who was made churchwarden in 1695, was a trustee of the church and school funds in 1 701, rented part of the Sedbergh school property, then known as Boiling's Farm, in 1706, which continued in the hands ofthe family 160 years. He died in 1740, aged 86. His eldest son, Edward, born in 1690, died unmarried in 1766. John, the second son, born in 1695, died in 1723, unmarried also, it is be lieved The third, Nathaniel Boiling, gent., born in 1698, was married, and had a son who died in his infancy, and a daughter who married William Prescott, of Halifax. William Boiling, tobacconist, afterwards styled gent., of Ilkley, the fourth son, makes good the failing name. He was born in 1708, and in 1745 married Ph\u0153be, daughter of \" vicar \" Lister Eight children were born of this marriage, of which John, born on St. John's Day, 1746, was the eldest. He married Mary, daughter of Ellis Cunliff, in 1776, and four years after this, in 1780, his father died and was buried in the North aisle of the church. John Boiling and his wife Mary had five children. Ph\u0153be, born in 1777 died young. Ellis, born in 1780, died in 185 1. Ph\u0153be, second, born 'in 1782, married Richard Margerison: then there was William, who died in 1867, aged 79, and Lister, who died in the same year, aged 76. The old Boiling home was a noteworthy sight 50 years ago ; \"Natty\" and Robert of the elder family were living, and Ellis, William, and Lister, of the later, all single men, and all clinging to the old nest, with Mary Cunliffe to mind them. Those who knew her said she was a wonderful woman, she took summer boarders before any house was built for that purpose, fine old families like the Luptons, of Leeds, came to her house, and she sent the boys home to dream of her splendid country table. The Bollings had a great deal of money among them for those times, and were counted a little close. It was true and not true. They were savers but could give, and were distinguished for the most absolute and spotless integrity. They would drive a close bargain, but would not peril their honour even in a horse trade. There is a branch of this fine old family in Virginia in the American colonies. Bristol parish was the point of their settlement; they spring from a branch which struck root in London and then came to the colonies, where they became of kin by marriage to Pochontos, the famous Indian Princess. They also inter- married with the Blands, now of Kippax, who sent a cadet of the house over here, and were neighbours of the Fairfaxes, who had come over here from Denton."], [229, "FAMILIES 205 BOLLING PEDIGREE.\u2014 Arms, See Plate.

The Boiling brothers employed a poor man to the end of his life, whose race easily spanned the time in our town between the great Armada and the Crimean War. John Lofthouse was the last of them, he never married. The family rose to be freeholders ; two generations of them were our first carriers ; they also minded the church in their turn, but some of them clung to the old faith, and suffered for it more than once. William Lofthouse, of Ilkley, made his will in 1707. In 1778, Eleanor Whitehead, relict of Richard Whitehead, husbandman, made her will, and bequeathed \" to Sarah Lofthouse my black crape gown, strong white apron, pair of little bed stocks, chaff bed, bolsters, pair of blankets, sheet, bed quilt, cupboard, chair, smothing iron, heaters, tongs, and fire point. To my son-in-law, Richard Whitehead, of Burley Woodhead, one shilling a twelve month after my decease."], [230, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. 206 The rest to Elizabeth, wife of Ingram Holmes, and her sister, Mary Bullock.\" The Rev. G. Benson was the writer of most of the wills at that time. Old John Lofthouse did not care for sectarian things, but a strain out of one of the great Masses had touched him at some time, and that was his worship for ever after, so that when phrenology came up, and we were all eager to verify our heads, we concluded that a certain curious bump on John's head was \"tf Ludge tune.\" When poor John died, the eyes of a line closed that had loved to look on the river and woods and the hills within Ilkley for more than 300 years. The Nowells lingered in Ilkley over 200 years. They were gentry in 1635, when John Nowell died, having come here from Goosenargh to marry Mary Lodge, in 16 16, and settle here; but in 1835 the family had got down to shoe making; yet whoever remembers John Nowell cobbling shoes in the old thatched house by the New Inn, remembers a man who held the fine aroma of his gentle ancestry. He was son of Joseph, of Holling Hall, and grandson of Stephen, of Embsay. He was sorely beset with doubts also about the claims of the Parish Church, and the Lodge, and Methodist Chapels on his soul. He never could get at the rights of it, but wandered round, a pathetic figure, even to a boy ; joining one, then another, and then doing it all over again, but finding no rest. The loss of that lad, whose tombstone is near the North door of the old church, came near breaking his poor old heart. The Sheaffields who are living in Ilkley in the wars of the Roses stay down to the times of Charles II., send a son in that reign to London to seek his fortune and then die out of the land. They are of the wild and restless breed we trace so easily in the manor court, who will see to it that their bows shall abide in strength while that mighty arm of England holds good, and the golden butts stand for a mark, and the game runs free in the woods and wild pastures. They are for ever in trouble for taking green yew or for assaults. Anthony Mawde married Elizabeth, daughter of Bryan Sheffield, in 1634, when she was thirty-one. The Wrights are now almost forgotten, but William, Nathan and Elizabeth lived down to our time in the Western end of the Low Hall ; were of the old faith to the end, and are reported among the recusants as early as 1601. We trace them through 250 years. Stead. \u2014 It was the boast of Master Joseph Stead, of Hangingstone, in my time, that his family had lived where he was living \" aboon two hunderd year.\" They neighboured with the crest of crags more than 250 years, and as the del Stedes of an earlier day, the family lived on that South-eastern lift of Ilkley more than 500 years, while old Joseph had such a race of flaxen-haired and blue-eyed children under the old thatch as is seldom seen, 16 of them, if I remember the count. The place name 'Stead' still exists here, but an old branch was also settled at Hangingstone, alias Todthorpe, for several centuries, were farmers, noted for their long ages, and bheir tenacity in adhering to the old names, Bryan, Mauger, Edward, and John. The Andersons appear in Elizabeth's day in Austby, and finally pro-"], [231, "families. 207 duce for us William, who kept watch and ward in Napoleon's time on Beacon Hill.

They are freeholders of weight and influence for a long time, and do their full share in taking care of the parish. Old John, who was a very for lorn figure, held on to a small freehold, had no wife or children, and no standing in the town except at elections. Then John became of great consequence and was visited by \" deputations \" at which he usually swore, but would make up his mind to vote through some process nobody could ever guess at, and when he went to Otley on this great errand he even went so far as to wash his face. The Watkinsons. \u2014 When Thoresby comes to the Watkinsons in the Ducatus, he says, \"In a pedigree of 20 descents shall rarely be found a like number of learned and ingenious gentlemen, eminent Dignitaries and pious Authors, as in this of the Watkinsons, with the inoculated Branches.\" The line begins in Ilkley with Henry Watkinson, who appears in the Manor Court in 1594 as a tenant at will, and in 1596, is made con stable of the town and leather-stamper. Thoresby gives a pedigree of the family, which begins with this man, but it is evident he took no great pains \u2014 painstaking man as he was \u2014 to explore the Ilkley registers ;"], [232, "208 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. it is by no means clear indeed that he ever saw them, so we must venture to correct him where he blunders, and to fill out the lines he has missed from these and other records. Henry seems to have been the choice man in a family of the name, which came into Ilkley from the pleasant lands in South Yorkshire. He had a brother Richard, who lived at Wheatley, in our parish, another brother Edward, and a sister Mary, who married William Maude, in 1609. Thoresby's pedigree gives this leather-stamper three children, and makes Joseph, whose \" Brass \" is still to be found in the church, the eldest son, Edward the next, and the last Henry, but as we find no mention of Henry in the parish registers, which begin in 1597, we may presume he was born before this date. In 1597, among the baptisms, we find \" Edward fil Henry Watkinson, Jan.\" Then we find a daughter Judith, born in 1599. Joseph was born in 1601, and a daughter Alice in 1603. So there were five children in the home, and then when the youngest was about six years old, a great desolation fell on them. The mother was buried Feb. 11, 1609, and it would seem that the father also was failing, for he made his will three days after the burial, and four months after that, June 15, 16 10, the children followed the father also to his burial, and then went home, poor bairns, to face the world as they might. And they fought a good fight I. \u2014 Henry found his way to Leeds in time, and became a merchant of repute there, married Bridget, daughter of Thomas Lodge, and lived in a fine house in Kirkgate, which had been occupied by the father of Sir William Lowther, and by Edward Fairfax, the poet. They had two sons, Henry, baptized April 24, 1628, and Christopher, baptized Aug. 11, 1630. Then Henry died in his prime, as his father had died before him, and was buried Nov. 2, 1638. Henry, his eldest son, and the third of the name, rose to great eminence. He took the degree of LL.D., and became Chancellor and Vicar General to four Archbishops of York, married Elizabeth, widow of Christopher Hodgson, of New Hall, and became the father of four children, Henry, a Spanish merchant, Edmund and William, twins, and Mary, who married William Pearson, also Chancellor to my lord of York, and rector of Bolton Percy. Christopher, the second son of the Leeds merchant, married Mary, daughter of William Foxley, twice Mayor of Hull, and they also had four children, Christopher, a merchant of Hamburg, Mary, wife of Sir David Hocksetter, of London, Bridget, wife of Richard Thornton, Recorder of Leeds, and Elizabeth, and here we will drop the thread. II. \u2014 Edward Watkinson, second son of our Ilkley Constable, became rector of Scruton, in the North, but has left us no story to tell. III. \u2014 Joseph stayed where he was born, and married Mary Binns. The name belongs across the moor to the North, the Binns nestled in a pretty hollow on the left in the old times as one goes from Blubber houses to Bolton, and we may presume it was there Joseph found Mary. He held lands of Wm. Middleton, Esq., in 1658, paying 7s. a year rent, and the usual manorial customs. He rented a farm belonging to"], [233, "FAMILIES. 209 Sedbergh School, in Ilkley, when such things were to be had for a mere song, and rose to such esteem in the town, that when Mrs. Katherine Middleton, of Stockeld, borrowed ;\u00a3ioo of the school money \u2014 on a time the great old family had to wade through the deep troubles that came on them by the civil war \u2014 he became her surety. He was churchwarden in 1629-42-52, and in 1661, and a touch of imagi nation will let our readers see him sitting with his wife and son and the two maid children that were given them, in the quaint oaken pew that still remains carven with his initials and the date, as shewn on illustration on page 165. His son died at 17 years of age. Elizabeth, the elder daughter, married Godfrey Lawson, Esq., who was Mayor of Leeds in 1669, and Mary, the second daughter, married Wilfrid Lawson, of Wakefield. Elizabeth Lawson had only one daughter who grew up ; she married Ralph Lowther, of Ackworth Park. The Wakefield family had four children, of which the youngest, Elizabeth, married Richard Witton, also of Wakefield, who had, among other good things with his wife, the field now called Witton Croft, which in 1730, was left to the poor. Under Wakefield, old Thomas Gent, in his Ripon, refers to the Lawsons of Icklay, pp. 12, 31. The will of Joseph Watkinson, of Ilkley, gentleman, is dated 2 Oct., 1669 : \u2014 \"To my daughter Mary Lawson, of Ilkley, all my household goods (excepting 2 pieces of Plate to witt the 2 new Tumblers which I give to my daughter Eliz. Lawson). Also to the sd Mary L. all my lands in parishes of Ilkley and Addingham, with all the stock of goods upon said lands, except 6 oxen of my own breed, which I give to my daughter Eliz. Lawson.

Lawson, remainder of my estate, and my Bookes to my 2 daughters : \u2014 Eliz. Lawson, sole executrix. Wm. Hustler, Wilfrid Lawson, Godfrey Lawson, Witnesses.\" Some of these Lawsons were once at Wheatley ; John Lawson, senex, was buried from there April 7, 1597. His son William died there in 1633, and his grandson, also William, in 1650, at Hingingstone. A Wilfrid Lawson is churchwarden in 1618, 1621, 1634, 1659 and 1671. Wilfrid, of Wakefield, brought a suit in Chancery in which he claimed the Sedbergh School lands as his own ; his father-in-law had rented on two leases of 21 years each, followed by a third made to himself in 1681. He lost the suit and had to pay all the costs, and we find by these evidences that the Watkinson \" tack \" in Ilkley consisted of the East Close, Golden Butts, a dwelling-house, a tan yard, one acre in the West Holme, and nine other messuages.* * Plan's Sedbergh, pp. 121, 141.

They sought no wider world to live in, as they could find no sweeter. They have made a record, of which we may well be proud also, in their humbler lot, perhaps no finer instance of yeomanly worth can be found in our rustic annals than that of old Tommy Watkinson, of the Ling Park, who died not long ago in his 93rd year. Richard Witton, who married Elizabeth Lawson, was a barrister, and purchased Lupset from the Saviles. He was great grandson of Oliver Witton, of Illingworth, clothier, and grandson of Joshua Witton, of Sowerby, yeoman, and son of Joshua Witton, of Thornhill, and York, who was chaplain to Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax. Richard and Elizabeth had six children, Richard, John, Henry, Mary, Margaret, and Elizabeth. The father died in 17 18, and the mother in 1727. The eldest son married Jane, daughter of Alderman Milner, of Leeds, sister of Sir William Milner. He died without issue, 1743; Henry had died in infancy ; and John, Prebendary of York, who married Mary Assheton, of Cuerden, died without issue in 1754. His widow married Peregrine Wentworth, Esq., and upon her death, the Witton estates passed to the descendants of the first Richard's sister, Elizabeth Ferrars. The Witton arms are : \u2014 Sable, a water bouget, argent; in chief, three plates. The arms of Sir Wilfrid Lawson are : \u2014 Per pale, argent and sable, a chevron, counterchanged. The crest : \u2014 Two flexed arms, argent, supporting the sun proper. (See page 172.) The Longfellows are not found in our famous \"Directory\" of 1379, or in the County, so far as we know, for a good while after that date We find them first in Otley, when James Langfellay makes his will, June 18, 1486, and dies before the end of July, leaves 20 shillings to the church at Otley, and a quarter of a mark for torches, makes his wife Alice, and John Langfellay, executors of this will, and as one imagines, indicates that he is a new man in Otley, and has a close kinship with Helaugh Park in the Ainsty, for he will have his body buried in the monastery there. Who this John Langfellay, executor to the will, was, we do not know, and do not find any other man with this Christian name until about 34 years after, when a John Langfellay sends in a petition asking to be admitted as tenant of a small place under the Middletons, in Ilkley parish, about 1520. In 15 21, he comes into the Manor Court, and is fined for taking the lord's wood, with twenty-one more. In 1524, he pays one day's wages as a labouring man to the subsidy, demanded by His Majesty to fight the French, is one of two in his condition who are willing to do this, and one in six in the whole parish of any condition, the fighting Cromacks being also of the number, and paying twelve pence as freeholders. In 1537, Richard Langfellay, of Otley, by his will, proved April 26, gives to the reparation of Otley Bridge, 40s., and for a substantial cross to be erected thereupon, with a little ymage of Our Lady, 6s. 8d.

In 1585, he is ordered at the Spring Court to \"putt awaye his dogge,\" but we hear of the dogge again at the Fall Court, trotting after his master as usual, and then John is ordered to \" putt awaye his dogge before Mawdlemas on payne of 2s. 6d.\" In 1583, he is stated to be aged lx years, or thereabout. He appears as a tenant at will again in 1589, and, in 1590, gives evidence adverse to the Middletons, in the Holling Hall dispute, touching the manor rights, \"being then about 70 years of age.\" He is still living in 1594, and may indeed be this patriarch of 90 who makes a will, Oct. 9th, 1609, and dies Sep. 23rd, 161 1.

There is another will, bearing date Feb. 1635-6, proved in May, made by John Longfellow, of Stockell, yeoman. He is clearly of the Ilkley stock and is very well to do, owning lands, barns, and closes in Ilkley, which his brother Robert holds at a rent often pounds a year. He died at no great age, his mother being still alive, but he has a son John, who is living under the cloud of an alias \u2014 Knatten, not too well born, we may fear, for we hear of no wife. He was probably steward of the estate of the Middletons, or some great person at the Hall, for he remembers the kitchen boy handsomely, and does not forget the hinds, leaves ten shillings to the poor at Ilkley, \"now lost,\" and sends money round from the dead-hand also to the poor of Spofforth, Sicklinghall, Linton, Wetherby, Plumpton and Folifoot. He mentions a brother William in this will, whom"], [237, "FAMILIES 213 we may take to be the William Longfellow, born in 1624-5, who went to live at Horssorth, where a son was born, in 165 1, who emigrated in due time to America and settled at Newbury, Mass., and there, Nov. ioth, 1676 or 78, the date is not clear, married Ann, daughter of Henry Sewall, and sister of Chief Justice Sewall, his bride being only sixteen years of age. Five children were born of this marriage, three sons and two daughters, and one of these sons is mentioned in a letter from Judge Sewall to his brother Stephen Sewall, of Bishopstake in Hampshire, dated Boston, 1680, with other matters of interest : \u2014 \" Bro Longfellow's father, William Longfellow, lives at Horssorth, near Leeds, in Yorkshire. Tell him Bro has a son William, a fine likely child, and a very good piece of land, and greatly wants a little stock to manage it, and that father hath paid for him upwards of a hundred pounds to get him out of debt\" A note is added to this letter, printed in the New England Historical and Genealogical Register, to say his father must have died about 1687, for in that year he went to Yorkshire to obtain his patrimony. He is back from Yorkshire again, as we may presume, in 1688, for in that year we find this entry in the Town's Book of Newbury : \u2014 \"Mr. Longfellow has houses 2, plough lands 6, meadows 10, horses 1, cows 1, sheep 10, hogs 2.\" He was not well to do, therefore, by the colonial standard, even when he had got hold of the Yorkshire inheri tance; and sat lightly on his farm also, for 1690, he went out with the disastrous expedition of Sir William Phipps against Quebec, one authority says with the rank of Ensign, and another of Major ; be this as it may, this was the end of all his labour under the sun, for he was reported \"lost\" with nine others in a storm off Cape Breton, or off the island of Anacosti, others will have it at the mouth of the St. Lawrence, in any case he came back no more to Newbury, and so, on May nth, 1692, Ann Longfellow, his widow, married Henry Short, the Schoolmaster and Town Clerk. The family of five, born to her first marriage, is the line which connects Ilkley by one remove, if that which is wanting could be numbered, with the family of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, our great and good poet. They went down into Maine after this, and up into New Hampshire, where we need not follow them, except just to say that still another William Longfellow was taken prisoner in the Brig Nancy, and laid by the heels together with his ship-mates, for we know not how long, in an English prison, in 1777. Of the ancient Ilkley stock we may say further that they have to take their fortune very much as it comes, like the rest, and some have only a very poor lot. Richard, in 1597, is a homeless and hapless man. The William of 1609 \"has his hands.\" James, Richard, and Edward are poor enough in 1618, to take the Christmas dole, with thirty-four more of other names, but we must still remember this was not parish relief, but due share in a bounty for the striving poor. The name holds good in our parish, through about two centuries and a quarter, when John Longfellow, the last of the line, dies in 1 748."], [238, "214 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN.

His daughter Ann, baptized in 1634, married ffrancis Clapham, in April, 1670.

Edmund Mauleverer, Esq., will proved, 1488, was buried at Bardsey. His son Robert made his will in 1496, and Sir Peter Middelton is men tioned as an executor. Robert was buried at Allerton Mauleverer in 1500. John Mauleverer, born about 1342, married Eleanor, daughter of Sir Peter Middelton ; and a copy of the brass at Allerton, by permission of Mr. Smith {Old York shire, vol. iv.), is re produced here. Their son, Sir Halnath, named after his paternal grand father was High Sheriff in 1420-1. In 1379, Ilkley had its Walker or Fulling-miller, Tailor, Milner, Fowler, and a Serjeant, Tasker, Clarke, Waite ; Nessfield had a Barbour, Turner, Oxenhird, Shephird and Webster; Middleton had a Mason, Waite, Webster, Kitchen(man), Priestman. A Wright is mentioned in the rolls of that time, but not in the Poll Tax list, and the Oxenhird is called Cowhird in the rolls. In 1413, the Sclater appears and founds a family, as does a Hogard, Hogward, or Hogyard. A Clerk and a Smyth appear in 1458. About the time of the Re formation a Lister comes into the parish.

The list also shews the localities tenanted, the occupations of the people, and the general longevity attained. Of the Atkinsons, numerous entries will be found in the Parish Registers. They lived at Wheatley, or Todthorpe, before 1700, at Lower Woodhouse, or Ramsgill and at Austby, from 1700, and are styled yeomen and farmers. Abraham Atkinson, of Stubham Hall, farmer, gentleman, died 1732, aged 68, and Mrs. Catherine his widow, died 1747. They were Roman Catholics, so the entries in the Registers are imperfect.

Bainton on the East, the farm of William Langfellow on the West, lands of John Cowgill on South, and lands of William Currer on the North ; also a meadow containing eight selions (6 roods) in Peasebarrfeild. In 1625, Mawde conveyed to the two Midgeleys, then described as yeomen, of Ilkley, two messuages in the tenure of George Gill and Edward Langfellow, with Beckclose and open Hewcroft, formerly purchased from William and Gilford Cromack, yeomen. The year before, they had acquired a selion (1 rood) in Peasebarrfeild from Thomas Currer, abutting on said Currer's lands on the South and West, said Midgley's land on the North, and Robert Broadbelt's on the East. The following deed, being amongst the number, leads one to expect that Robert Midgley was ofthe family at Headley and Bolton, near Bradford, and therefore a descen dant of the Midgleys of Midgley, Halifax Parish. Sa. Sunderland, Esq., of Harden, quit-claimed two messuages at Bolton, Feb. 26, 1661, to Joseph Midgley, of Bolton, yeoman, and Joseph, his son. In 1706, Robert Midgley, of Winewall, Lancashire, gent, Mary, his wife, and John, his eldest son, leased to Nicholas Cunliffe, of Ilkley, grocer, the dwellinghouse in the tenure of John Petty, with Hewcroft closes, Parsonage Garth, and Parson crofts.

John, of Drighlington, yeoman, will dated and proved, 1627, was the father of Archbishop James Margetson, of Armagh, who founded Drighlington Free School. Lords Charlemont and Duncannon married respectively the Archbishop's daughter and grand-daughter.

Richard, the 4th Baron, was father of William, founder of Salley Abbey, 5th Baron, whose daughter, Agnes, married Jocelyn de Lourain, who assumed the name of Percy. Their children were Henry, Richard, (who usurped the possessions of his nephew, William, son of Henry, until his death in 1244, when William regained them. Richard, son of Richard, however, continued to hold Settle and other Yorkshire possessions), and Ralph, a quo the Percies of South France. Henry, above named, was 6th Baron. Richard is given as 7th Baron by usurpation. He was a great leader in the reigns of John and Henry III. William, 8th Baron died in 1245, leaving a numerous family.

His publica tions have obtained a large circulation on both sides the Atlantic. The Yorkshire Arch\u00e6ological Association did honour to itself by asking him to be chairman at the annual gathering in 1883. He was born at Iveighley, Dec. 8th, 1823, his parents returned next month to Blubber houses, he worked at the mill there for six years, removing in 1838, at fourteen years of age, to learn the blacksmith craft at Ilkley, under old Jacky Birch, who had taught the trade to Samuel Collyer, his father, at Blubberhouses.

In 1879, he took charge of the Church of the Messiah in New York. He has several times paid visits to the old Yorkshire haunts. By dint of continued importunities, I was fortunate in obtaining the steel-plate portrait that adorns this volume. [J. H. T.] John Dobson \u2014 A Memory. \u2014 The Dobsons flit into our parish in 1559, in the person of William, son of John Dobson, of Merey, clothier, who gives the capital messuage called Woodhouses to Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Baxter, of Carleton in Craven, when she takes the said William for her husband. There was a Dobbe here in 1467. Francis Dobson was the Ilkley tailor, 1730; his widow died in 1786, aged 81. William, weaver, was father of John, who was killed by a blow with a spade on his head in an affray at Burley feast, 1792, aged 29. The present family springs from Michael Dobson, who reached fourscore years, and was father of Edward, of Bradford, James, Francis, and William Lister Dobson, of Burley, artist, who died in 1870, aged 75. Francis made his mark as a carrier and coach proprietor. In a wider field he would have risen to eminence, for he was a very able man, and made his way from a cart to wagons, and from an ancient car to a capital coach, which was very popular until the railroad ruined the coaching trade, and then the business broke up. Francis was a man of a certain inward life, quiet and self-contained, but apt to give forth a little glow on rare occasions in the little Methodist Chapel, and was one of the fathers of Methodism in Ilkley. He died in 1872, aged 81, and was father of William (Station Hotel), Daniel, Charles, and Frank. James, Michael's second son, fought as brave a battle as any man I have ever known, to raise his family of nine children in the desperate times that followed the great wars, and made poor men ache with poverty in their very bones. He had a wide and ample head, set on a little wiry frame, fine grey eyes, and a voice like the deeper notes of a flute. He was a local preacher among the Primitive Methodists for many years, would often walk twenty miles or more on a Sunday with his message in his heart, and beside that, helped more than any other man to nourish \" the cause \" in an old chamber where the Crescent stands, giving actual money out of the poor pittance he could earn, and \" drinkin \" and supper to the brethren who came to preach. James was cheery as a lark always, combed wool when there was any to comb, and fished for trout in the kindly days of the good old squire, knew the deep shadowy pools where they lay, and the ripples where they ran, better than any other man in Ilkley. He also got some donkeys finally, and these helped also to bear the burden, but with not so rare a patience or endurance as his own, and so he lived his brave and manful life, and died in 1871, being a few years past 80. His sons were John, Michael (father of Benjamin, Jabez, of Craiglands, Edmund, John, of Troutbeck, and Henry, a physician), James, (father of William, John, and Michael), Hezekiah, of the Royal Hotel, Edward,"], [275, "FAMILIES. 243 and Alexander (father of Edward, George, William, Ellis, and Henry). The eldest son, John, was to the writer's mind, the noblest man of his generation in the town. John was raised to his father's craft of wool combing, and followed it for many years, but took hold promptly of Hydropathic bathing, when that came first to Ilkley, and so made more money at a rather desperate cost to his nature, delicate and fine as that of a good woman. He also took orders as a Methodist local preacher among the Primitives, and a few men loved to hear him preach, especially in Bradley-by-Kildwick, where, forty years ago, a lovely rose of virtue grew and of grace. But he was never popular with his sect, because he did not appeal to the emotions, but went right on and argued the thing out, glowing like white hickory now and then, but never breaking out into flames, and so falling short of popularity on the primitive ground of his discourse, for the reason a fine old critic gave to another young fellow in the town when he heard his maiden effort, \" Thaa wants to reason ivry thing out, and that isn't t' waay.\" John was not preaching, except on rare occasions, when I first met him 45 years ago, but was the most eager reader in the town, and especially of the books that cannot be taken in fragments, but have to be consumed whole in the fires of the heart and brain. Scotch metaphysics, arguments deep and vital about the supremacy of spirit over matter ; the immanence of God and His adequacy ; essays like those of John Foster ; and stories of dauntless fights for freedom like those of the Covenanters, but no fiction. He scorned such books as Old Mortality in those days, and considered McCries' reply to Sir Walter's mis-statements, touching his beloved Covenanters, of more worth than all the Waverley stories put together. John never married. There was too much to do for many years in the old home, nor do I imagine he was ever taken captive, so that he must marry or go henceforth with his life shorn of its choicest grace. But the great, good heart was filled with a devouring love for the youths all about him, who were feeling their way into life, learning to love good books, and trying to make fair terms for their budding manhood. These were John's sons, and were dear to him as David was to Jonathan. He told them what he knew, and his knowledge was ample, lavished all he could spare on them for more books, and more, went out with them to look at the glory of the little world which stretches from Malham to York, and better than all, was jealous with a great jealousy that they should not be a mere echo of himself, but that each lad should grow to his own stature, and think his own thoughts. He was the living chronicle of the town too. We usually neglect to gather the legends and traditions of a small country place until those who treasure them are dead, but his ear was early open to them, as his eyes were open to note all quaint and curious things. I notice the author of \"John Halifax\" found him out, and has recorded an interview with him, and some of the stories he had to tell. It was a great delight to him also to wander away alone into Scotland"], [276, "244 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. on a working man's wages, to visit old battle-fields and the shrines of the saints who had won his heart. If he had come into the' world 200 years before, he would have gone out with Black Tom o' Denton to the battle, but then he would have changed into the Ironsides, and when he found that there was still a remnant in Scotland which would not give in because of their ancient quarrel with Charles of un-blessed memory, only the good common sense that held him fair and true through all waters and all weathers prevented him from hunting them out, and saying we are of the same mind. Half a dozen men owe more to good John Dobson than to any other man, and the writer of this memory among the rest. Their life has been greatly worth living because he helped them so nobly at the start, and directed them so wisely, and loved them as few fathers ever love their sons, and this attempt at a History of Old Ilkley could not be complete to the writer's mind, as indeed it could not have been made with John Dobson left out, who rests now by the river whose waters made music for him summer and winter all his life. In addition to his talents as a botanist, he took great interest in folk lore, and read a lecture to the townspeople in 1873, entitled \"Ilkley fifty years ago,\" the substance of which we incorporate at the close of the next chapter. We are indebted to Messrs. Dobson, of Troutbeck and Craiglands, for the portrait of their uncle.

HE first years of the last century bring us the first mention of the great clear spring on the moor, which has done so much to make the fortune of our town. In the days old men easily remember, it rushed down in one grand torrent at the outlet behind the old White Wells, so that you were fain to hold your cup at the hither edge of the royal plenty to secure a drink, and the inscription over the great stone bath ran \u2014 \"This holds 1150 gallons, and fills in 13 minutes.\" Dr. Richardson, of Bierley, in a letter written about 1709, which Hearne prints in his edition of Leland's Itinerary, says : \u2014 \" Ilkley now is a very mean place, and is equally dirty and insignifi cant, and chiefly famous for a cold well, which has done very remarkable cures in scrofulous cases by bathing, and in drinking of it.\" Ralph Thoresby makes no mention of the spring as he passes through our town on his way to Addingham, in 1694, though he stops to copy the inscription on our replicate of the Roman altar in Bridge Street. He was very fond of spas, and we may conclude he would have noticed ours if it had begun to be heard of, though this is to be said also, that Thoresby seems to have set store on such things in proportion to their nastiness, and so may easily have neglected any budding forth of virtue in our priceless treasure out of the rock, famous only for its sweetness and purity. The primitive wells stood nearer the spring head and were free to all comers, almost to the close of the century, if we may judge from the record in the Register, in 1793 \u2014 \"Ann, daughter of William Harper, butcher, was drowned in attempting to bathe herself in the Spaw Well, Aug. 15, aged 9.\" The White Wells, as they now stand, with the exception of the charity baths, were built about a century ago. A book in the writer's possession, with an autograph of Mr. William Middleton, reveals the fact that \" the old squire \" was turning his atten tion to spas as the 18th century was going out, and had the White Wells in his mind. Meanwhile we pick up hints in the Parish Registers, we must credit to the spring, and believe that its fame was going out through the land,"], [280, "246 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. but the succour given to Roman Catholics accounts for other entries. The worth of the waters, the lovely landscape, the free blowing winds on the moors, the sunshine rippling like a vast translucent sea, as you stand knee-deep in the sweet blossoming heather, the breath of kine, the homely fare, and the quietness which lay on all things like Bunyan's dream of Beulah, touched the heart and imagination of the forlorn, far and wide, and drew them to the pretty rural hollow, that had been waiting to help and bless them time out of mind. The History of Wharfedale, by Thomas Shaw, M.R.C.S., (Otley : W. Walker, 1830), refers to Mr. Middleton's munificence in building these baths, dressing-rooms, and making the wells. He had made every con venience necessary for a bathing place. \" His permission for gentlemen to shoot on the manor, and fish in the river deserves to be recorded.\" WHITE HOUSE AND MOOR. \"The water is, perhaps, for its purity, tenuity and coldness, the best qualified to be of utility for relaxed and sedentary habits of any water in this part of the country. It has frequently been analysed, but the de composition always proved that it contains no medicinal quality. In my opinion, it is its purity and softness only, which makes it more efficacious, by passing sooner to the utmost and finest limits of the cir culation than any water known. For scrofulous cases, long confinement in populous towns, effects arising from late hours, the abuse of liquors &c, it is certainly excellent. It has acquired a reputation, and has long been established. The lodging houses till lately were poor and damp, which must have impeded the recovery of invalids resorting to the place.\" The praise of the spring had been sung by Maude in his Vtrbeia, or Wharfedale, a Poem, Descriptive and Didactic, with"], [281, "MODERN ILKLEY. 247 Historical Remarks, fifty years before Mr. Shaw wrote. The book was published anonymously by Blanchard & Co., York, 1782, and contains in 4to., xii., 44 and 45 pages. It is dedicated, from the foot of Parnassus, to Edward Lascelles, Esq. \" Must Ilkley then in slighted silence pass, Nor once reflect her features in the glass ; Where Roman polish, Roman arms subdu'd The fierce ferocity of Britain's brood ? Nor less Hygeia shall thy spring impart The balmy succours of the Medic art. Flow on, kind stream, proceed in fame to heal, And may each pallid Nymph thy influence feel ; The swain enjoy those calm delights of health, Superior to the gilded joys of wealth. Then shaU the rural bard thy altar raise, And grateful waft thee thro' a world of praise.\" In a note, he adds \u2014 \" The village is frequented in the summer season, on account of its spring, issuing from the side of a mountain near to the town. Whether there are any virtues in the water, more than its purity, and the tenuity of its component parts for internal use, by which it may sooner pass the uttermost meanders of circulation, and which gives it a consequent coldness in the use of bathing, is a point which the inquisi tive must determine. Certain it is, that the waters have no gustable properties, by which their quality or operation may be ascertained. It has acquired a reputation, and, moreover, been long established.\" Evidently Dr. Shaw has done a bit of copying from this account. The water was formerly gathered at the foot of the crag in a circular well, but carried forwards by a stone channel to the White House, when the present well was erected, the image of which answers for the Local Board Seal. William Butterfield, the son of another William Butterfield, who managed the baths when George the Third was king, still treats his visitors, on payment of sixpence, to a plunge, douce, spouting, or shower bath ; and few would ever think of leaving Ilkley, without a copious draught of the ice-cold water. The Local Board now holds the property. A small guide of 32 pages was issued in 1829: \u2014 \"The Visitor's Guide to the Beauties of Ilkley and its Neighbourhood by two junior Visitors.

For further particulars of the Hydropathic Establishments at Ben Rhydding and Ilkley, intending visitors are advised to write to the Proprietors in each case for a prospectus. 1846. \u2014 Tithe Commutation Plan for Ilkley gives the area at 3961a. 2r. 22p., of which 404a. were arable land, 1192a. meadow, 132a. newly enclosed, 152a. woodland, 21a. homesteads, 58a. roads and wastes, 2000a. uncultivated. The Nesfield and Langbar Plan records 2161a. ir. 33P. as the township area, 189a. arable land, 889a. meadow, 60a. woodland, 22a. roads and wastes, 1000a. uncultivated moor.

In 1861, Ilkley had 197 houses with 1043 inhabitants, or 1407 in the parish. The following year the Ilkley Hospital was established. We have now to record a remarkable event \u2014 the birth and death of the first Local Board, being dissolved because it was illegally constituted. The members, who reigned three months only, were \u2014 George Brumfit, John C. Batty, Marshall Hainsworth, Wm. P. Harrison, M.D., John Ellis, John Lister, Wm. Macleod, M.D., Thomas Robinson, and Henry Strachan. The first meeting was held Dec. 8th, 1864, in the church vestry; the last meeting, March 18th, 1865. In January, 1869, the first election of the legal Local Board, still living to good purpose, took place ; and no small credit is due to the succession of members for the present satisfactory condition of the streets and town of Ilkley. Of Jonathan Hainsworth, who died Oct. 16th, 1884, aged 49 years, special mention must be made. This book was to have had the benefit of his corrections and additions in two or three chapters, but he only read the one on the Romans. On the First of August, 1865, the Railway was opened. Shortly before this date, seven coaches in summer, two in winter, ran into Ilkley daily, and one twice-a-week from Leeds all the year round. In 1866, November, occurred the great Yorkshire flood, which is duly chronicled on the Bridge. In 1867, the rateable value of Ilkley was which increased to .\u00a311,000 in 1870. The great sales of Mr. Middelton's property in Ilkley began June 5th, 1867, the second, June 5th, 1868, the third, August 20th, 1868, the fourth, July 28th, 1869, the fifth, August 16th, 1872, the sixth, July 28th, 1875, the seventh, August 30th, 1876, the eighth, August, 1877. Over ,\u00a370,000 were realized thereby, besides numerous private sales. In 1868, May 30th, the foundation stone of the Congregational Church in Green Lane (now Grove), was laid. August 29th, 1868, the Wesleyan Church foundation stone was laid. The spire was added in 1876. 1871. \u2014 Ilkley had 397 houses, with 2511 inhabitants. Middleton and Nesfield townships had 354 inhabitants. On Aug. 26th, the foundation stone of the National Schools was laid, and the Local Board purchased the Waterworks from a private Company this year. The Waterworks' Company, capital \u00a32500, had existed about twenty years. The Board added to the two springs (the Lesser and Greater Barmi shaws,) \u2014 Willie Hall's Spout. Richard Vickers, the post master since 1838, died Jan. 20th, 1872, aged 66. The Free Press was added to the newspapers during that month, and in the files of the three local papers, the passing events have been duly chronicled. Thus, in the year 1872, we meet with the record of public lectures by noted gentlemen ; the Church Institute being formed, the Mechanics' Institute consequently declined ; casts of Ilkley inscribed stones were sent to Leeds Museum"], [290, "CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH, ILKLEY.

Semon founded the Convalescent Home, which he presented to the Bradford Corporation. It is one of the many magnificent buildings that adorn modern Ilkley. In 1875, the Fountain at the top of Brook Street was erected; and in this year Mr. John Peele Clapham, J. P., died at his residence, Brookside. He was a noted Congregationalist. A notice of him appears in Andrew's Modern Yorkshire Poets. John Rigg, a hydropathic servant, is the subject of a humorous poetical sketch. The foundation stone of the Primitive Methodist Chapel was laid on Whit- Tuesday, 1877. Sewage Works were formed in that year. August 24th, 1878, the Roman Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart had its foundation stone laid. Ilkley was then of the rateable value of \u00a329,000; Middleton, \u00a32,000 ; Nesfield, \u00a31,850. In December, the School Board was formed, and the School Census gives \u2014 862 houses, 1741 males, 2272 females, (859 children), as residents. Sept. 10th, 1879, St. Margaret's Church was opened. The Building News had an engraving of it. In May, 1880, the Amphora, or water vessel, (see p. 30) was found."], [292, "256 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. A chalybeate spring, in Heber's Ghyll, was discovered in 1883. The population of the parish had reached 4733 in 1881, and during the present summer (1885), operations have been commenced for the new Railway from Skipton. Of the remaining institutions we have but space to give a list. The Society of Friends have a substantial meeting house of their own ; the Plymouth Brethren occupy the old Grammar School. Conservative Association, Liberal Club, Mutual Improvement Society, Vocal Society, Angling, Lawn Tennis, Cricket and Football Clubs, Ilkley Library, and the many private schools for which Ilkley is noted, completes our list. On the 8th of November, 1884, a most interesting Roman relic, as will be seen from our illustration, was discovered about two feet below the ground in the garden behind the Rose and Crown, where the stone is preserved. This gravestone, six feet long, by two-and-a-half across the centre, is in the rough state on the back, but carved with the image of a female seated in a chair, and the following inscription, on the front : [diis m]anibvs To the God of the Shades. ven nconis filia nconis daughter annorvm xxx ccornovia (aged) years 30, city of Cornovia h. s. e.

Here we have a reasonable etymology for Ben Rhydding, without the far-fetched theory of Mr. Isaac Taylor. A Ridding is a clearing, and we have many of them. Cote, busks, indicate woods ; butts may have been either to shoot at in archery days, or baulks or boundaries of lands; howarth is the enclosed hill ; boggards were very common before the introduction of gas ; silverwell was probably a holy well ; knolls are rounded hills ; kil indicates a fountain or spring ; the pinfold is kept in mind still, the goose greens or commons are well known ; Sedbergh lands \u2014 thereby hangs a tale. This property was given by the Middeltons to the Chantry of St. Nicholas in Ilkley Church. His Majesty having grabbed it with other chantries throughout the country, it was given by the Charter of Edward VI., dated May 14, 1552, to Sedbergh Grammar School.

Old Wells, or White House, with its gushing stream, and the clump of trees behind, are favourite resorts. On the rocks near, some \" cups \" are marked, as will be mentioned in the Prehistoric Chapter. We are not surprised that several poetic effusions have been evoked by the glorious prospect from this situation. The untold delight in crossing Rombalds Moor, when the heather is in bloom, is only equalled by the extacy on the first glimpse of Wharfedale fairyland. A small waterfall in Backstone Gill is worth the trouble ofthe short journey to see it, and the prospect from the Cow and Calf rocks is magnificent. Beneath lie Ben Rhydding, and the ancient Wheatley Hall, its gables and mullioned windows telling of its re-construction in Tudor or Stuart days. Cromwell, the soldier, is reported to have rested here, but one thinks Menston and Denton were too near to render this likely. The \" Cups and Rings \" on the rocks here will be noted, and a long scroll of carved texts of Scripture, the operator having, according to a doubtful report, committed suicide at the conclusion of his work, by leaping from the top. Craig Tarn is on the return journey. On the West side of Rombalds slope are the Panorama rocks, well deserving the name, Heber's Gill, with its chalybeate spring, Parish Gill, and several fine touches of scenery.

We guess it was made about 1758, and the wood engraving here produced is said to represent the town in 1827. ilkley, 1827. At that time the town beck came babbling down from the hills, through the Mill Ghyll in the sunny summer weather, and with a roar in the winter ; open to the day, and, crossing under the Otley Road, leapt into the ancient foss. On the East side was a foot way, on the West a cart way, and on both a choice collection of middens, which remained down to the Cholera Year of 1832, when Parson Fenton swept them away with a new besom he had got from London, to the great disgust of the ancient holders, who could not see for the life of them what such things had to do with the cholera. The two Inns, the Wheat Sheaf and the Rose and Crown, were quite of the antique type, brewed their own beer, and were not much more than the addenda to two fair farms. These, and three or four small shops, supplied whatever Ilkley and her visitors might need. The industries of the town were divided then between weaving and combing wool, together with the farming, but weaving had got its death 11."], [304, "ilkley : ancient and modern. 266 DOWN BROOK STREET.

The food of the people was mainly oatmeal and blue milk. If they could manage a pig, and sell the hams to pay for the feed, they rolled in luxury, and the standing invitation to their far away friends, in such a case was \" Ye mun cum and see us when we kill t'pig.\" Oatmeal porridge, oat cake, and potatoes, these were the staples, and not over enough of this food usually, yet they were a mirthful kind of folk, and a quiet, sometimes in mischief, but taking nothing which was not their own, save now and then a hare or a rabbit, and the whole world could not convince them this was any affront to good morals, because they held with their ancestors that the game belonged to the swift foot, and to the hand that could draw a bow. The Eastern and Western flanks of Hangingstone were covered with vast masses of gray crag, which lay thick almost to the old White AVells, and in the cliff (the West rock,) a pair of ravens had made a nest for their young from time immemorial, while the owls hooted at you \u2014 or at the moon \u2014 from the great West woods. The Cow-pasture was what its name indicates, the common pasture for the town, and a few poor folks still held rights in it, which pointed backward toward the primitive communal system, and there was no road through the pasture then, though there was a right of way if you could get your beast to take it. The road from Otley to Skipton had been remodelled then, so that we were no longer, as in Richardson's time, \"barred up by trackless wastes and impracticable ways, except by the great road which runs from Skipton to Kendal,\" and which, in all the old maps takes the North bank of the river, but there were still indications of the ancient bridle way, which must have lain parallel with, or on the Roman Road. The poor visitors housed in the cottages, the well to-do in four houses of some -note still standing, kept by the Bollings, Battys, Beanlands, and Senors. The writer dined with a lady in London this summer, 1883, who well remembered staying for the season at Senor's house, 70 years ago, and how it was counted then a rather splendid place. It is the house on the left in its little garden at the foot of Church Street. Little crofts and fields came up close about the town, which were belted about by tall hedgrows, lined with great oaks and plane trees, and a great wealth of trees stood also in the enclosures, so that as you came towards the town, little could be seen, half a mile away, except the old gray tower of the church. In Folk- Lore Record, Vol. I, there is a sketch entitled Fairies at /Mey Wells. The little \"folks,\" or some bigger ones, have wrought wonders in Ilkley in Queen Victoria's days.

He sums up the buildings as follows : A small worsted mill, made into four cottages, where the Wells' stables now are, thatched cottage at the present Vicarage gate, and another opposite, where the Royal Hotel stands, Miss Batty's and the Miller's houses, the upper and lower Cornmills, Sedbergh House, cottage near Station yard, three cottages where the Midland and North View Hotels are, an imposing thorn grew at the Station corner, opposite the beck bridge, over the battlements of which youngsters repeatedly fell. The old Manor House (?) occupied by the Hartleys, was near the present Craven Bank, an old saw-pit and the village stocks were near it, with the cartwright's timber strewed on the green in front of his shop. In Green Lane, now the Grove, was the thatched cottage still standing. Fine hollies grew on the lane side, and some magnificent ash trees. The banks of the beck in Brook Street were bedecked with wild flowers. A stone foot-bridge crossed the stream midway down the street, and lower still were stepping stones. On the East side, barns and cottages alternated from the Station gate to the Crescent. In a low rickety THE CRESCENT. chamber, over the larger house where the Crescent stands, the Methodists had worship for half a century. About 80 could be seated in it. On the opposite side, old cottages, barns, mistals and middens alternated. On Leeds Road were eight houses and the blacksmith's shop. Church Street remains much the same, but the new shops have been erected on the sites of old cottages. Bridge Lane had two houses the Low House, and the thatched one still standing. A farm and two houses, with the school, were on Addingham Road, and three cottages in Chapel or Yewcroft Lane, with earthen floors. The number of people was frequently counted at the hearth on winter nights.

Farms, as well as fields, had become gradually enlarged. Addingham and Baildon supplied materials for manufactures.

The visiting season lasted three months, from July ist. Around the ingle, weird beliefs and marvellous legends were told. Old men and women then drew aside the screen which curtained the past, and revealed departed customs. Quaint old poetry was sometimes recited. The fairies haunted every gill and waterfall. The wild, wintry, whistling winds, the creaking timbers of the old houses, the tick-tack of the death-watch, the hooting owls, the clanking of the de'ils chains, the howling dog, guy trash, gabriel ratchets, and barguest, the witches and wisemen, these, and a score more topics, told strongly on the popular mind, and made the young wish they were in bed, yet afraid to go Even the horse-shoe behind the door, and the manifold charms about the person did not lessen the dread much.

Horsfall Turner, from the Sessions Rolls, gives many interesting particulars of Ilkley Bridge. In early times great encouragement was given by the Church to the building of bridges, and people of property frequently bequeathed money for their repairs. Tolls were taken on some, and we frequently find that crosses, and sometimes chapels, were erected on them, and boxes were securely placed thereto for the reception of the alms of the traveller. After the Reformation, the county was held responsible for the repairing of the old public foundations, and thus we get the appli cations made to the magistrates in sessions assembled. Wooden bridges were common in very early times, and places now without bridges were formerly supplied. The old maps show that Addingham, now supplied only with a boat near West Hall, had its bridge, though it is not mentioned as being destroyed in the great flood of 1673. It was destroyed fourteen years afterwards, for at the Skipton Sessions, July, 1688, the inhabitants of Addingham send a petition to the magistrates, reciting that about a year ago a sudden storm washed away the stone bridge built by the Wapontake or Riding, and did great damage to the land, and asking for an estreat to be made. No further notice appears of Addingham Bridge, which is rather remarkable considering the"], [308, "270 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. importance of West Hall, Addingham, and other estates, whose owners, or their near relations, were magistrates. Ferry boats were maintained by the county at some places, and Addingham has had to be contented with a ferry for two centuries. ilkley bridge.

The present bridge has, of course, called for repeated renovations, and is considered a foolish piece of workmanship, with its high \"rig,\" but it has well withstood many heavy floods. It consists of three spans, the central one being widest. It is a favourite subject for the pencil, and artists may frequently be seen seated above and below it on the banks of the river. Mr. Jonathan Hainsworth cut the watermark of our last great flood, Nov. 23, 1866, on the S.E. corner of the bridge. When a new bridge is needed we hope it will be erected down by the lower ford, and leave this picturesque structure to the tastes of artists and antiquaries. At Ilkley Bridge we enter the well-wooded Middelton Park, and pass Middelton Lodge, of which we give an etched copy of an old drawing, made more than a century ago, and the accompanying engraving. The Lodge, as it at present stands, is a solid-looking unpretentious building, MIDDELTON LODGE. presenting from the village almost a castellated appearance. It probably dates from about the Elizabethan period, the rough-hewed wooden beams in the servants' staircase, and the oaken wainscotting still preserved in one of the rooms being opposed to the idea of any more recent erection. The Lodge possesses a reminder of its older days in the name \" donjon \" door, or as it is generally corrupted, dungeon door, applied to the entrance in the square, keep-like portion of the dwelling. The upper chambers of the Lodge were formerly used as a chapel in which its occupants could worship in secret, according to their ancestral faith. Nor was it without cost that they persisted in their devotion to the Romish See, for, in addition to the general obloquy and social per secution to which Catholics were subjected for generations after the KI."], [312, "274 ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. Reformation, the Middeltons had to bear heavy monetary penalties, as is shown by the formidable pile of papers referring to \"fines for recusancy \" still preserved amongst the family archives. The gradual enlightenment of public opinion has now happily swept away the persecuting spirit of sectarian bigotry, but it was only a generation ago that the secret chapel in the Lodge was superseded by the building which now forms an extension of the house, and is used both for family worship, and by the Catholic residents in the neighbourhood, the officiating priest being Mr. Middelton's private chaplain, who resides in an oratory erected in a retired spot within the bounds of the Lodge park. In the grounds, before and behind the Hall, are to be found the Roman and other antiquities previously mentioned, with querns, ancient font and crosses, and at a few hundred yards distance is a secluded, yet uncovered, place of worship, known as \" The Calvary,\" in the shape of a huge cross. The entrance to this devotional ground is through a rustic wooden archway, painted black, and with the words \"Tristis est anima mea usque ad mortem \" carved thereon. Along narrow passage between hedges of spruce trees leads up to a finely carved figure of the Virgin Mother, under a canopy, with the first verse of the beautiful old Latin hymn, \" Stabat Mater Dolorosa,\" engraved beneath. From thence, the roadway, sharply turning, leads through another gate to the foot of the cross, where the first \" station \" is placed. At the point forming the summit of the cross is a large heap of stones, some 25ft. high, called \" The Calvary,\" surmounted by three large wooden crosses, against the centre one of which leans the ladder, spear, and the reed, with the \" sponge dipped in hyssop \" upon its summit. Immediately under \" The Calvary \" is a small grotto, and behind this is a chamber containing a number of valuable old missals, and black letter volumes. The grotto has been fitted up originally as an oratory, with a small tabernacle containing a crucifix, and a copy of the nails used in the crucifixion as sold in Rome. It was set apart by the late Peter Middelton, Esq., and besides elaborate carvings of scenes in the last hours of Christ, similar to paintings and sculptures usually found in Roman Catholic churches, there is a carved ram's head, the workman- ship of Waterton, the naturalist, in 1861, and fragments of ancient crosses brought from Ilkley. The family chapel, with entrance from the Lodge, as well as from the grounds, is a neatly decorated structure. A mural tablet to Peter Middelton, Esq., and fourteen beautifully carved biblical scenes, and stained windows, adorn the interior. The Catholics of the parish worshipped here, by permission, before the Catholic Church at Ilkley was erected. Mr. King, Mr. Burgess, Mr. Tate, Mr. Watkinson, Mr. Jackson, and Mr. Pope have officiated here. There is a small gallery at the East end. The Altar and Font are gorgeously arrayed. In the private burial ground adjoining are three tombstones, and a cross ; the last erected over Maud Freeman, who died Dec. 23, 1877, aged 3 years.

Near the priest's house, on the road to Moorhouses, is an ancient milestone, indicating old English miles, \" To Keighley, 5 m.; to Rippon, 15 m.\" A paved road way passes directly under the greensward towards Windsover, from this road, and is probably the old Roman Road. It is very noticeable on Middleton Moor, West of Moorhouses. The huge stones of an old pack-horse road are still to be seen in Stubham Wood. Lines of a score pack horses, we are told, were fre quently seen wending their way, headed by the bell-horse, along this road. Low Hall, still, and and for a long time, the abode of the Aldersons, is a substantial old house, with a grand walnut tree in front. The Low Hall has lost much of its former importance, but the Middelton Arms, stained glass, and black oak antique table, with the massive porch, surmounted by a chamber, are worthy of inspection. A quern, discovered in the brick yard here, by Mr. B. Stapleton, near traces of a buried road, I have transferred to the care of the Bradford Historical Society. At the head of Stubham Wood we reach Middleton Moorhouses, a hamlet of about eighteen houses, mostly straw thatched, and our illustration, the work of Mr. Sabin, of New York, will eventually be more valuable, as these structures become every year diminished in number. On one house will be noticed wh 1669. The Catholic School, with stained window, is converted into a cottage. Ling Park, Windsover, and Oliver are old farm houses near. Cromwell Holme, Hesper Knowl, Heman Syke,"], [314, "ilkley: ancient and modern. 276 Stone Butts, Bean Butts, Burtrees, Hunger Hills, Skittricks, are significant field names. Pomona Cottage was, in 1829, a favourite pic-nic retreat for visitors, kept by Mrs. Scriven. Tivoli, the seat of Edward Middelton, Esq., is beautifully situated on the Nesfield side. Nesfield Hall has been re-built, and we find no traces of the grandeur of Nesfield when the Nesfields and Plumptons resided here. The property passed from the Listers to Mr. Bradshaw, of Bradford. The \"stocks \" still remain, in a dilapidated condition. A farmhouse bears the inscription, E.L. 1662. There are a few fine specimens of straw thatched houses in Nesfield. \" Church \" people hold cottage services here. Passing up Nick Lane, that is, if there is no flood running down it, you reach Langbar, with its barn-like Wesleyan Chapel, and solitary farms and cottages. Here are Ward's End, Hardisty House, Springwell House, Blackhill House, and Langshaw Bank \u2014 where a family of reputed sheep-stealers formerly lived, and Deanhead, the residence of the Priors, clockmakers. I learn that the Rev. John Prior Lockwood, Wesleyan minister, author of several biographical works, is grandson of Mr. John Prior, and has a photograph of one of Tunnicliffe's profiles of his grandfather. In Dr. Rees' Cyclopedia will be found a sketch of Mr. Prior's improvements in clocks, and mechanism generally. His astronomical clock was the wonder of the age. He invented also a new mode of finding the longitude at sea Mr. Lockwood states that his grandfather and great-uncle (George Prior), had some choice books, some of which seemed out of their latitude at Langbar, and, besides the Society of Arts medals, the house was internally adorned with framed certificates from various Societies. The Journal of the Society of Arts frequently refers to their works. Learned and otherwise distinguished persons sought, with some trouble, their solitary home. George Prior was a successful Methodist local preacher, and introduced Methodism into many surrounding villages. He travelled far and wide on his pony, and frequently held open-air services. Smith's Farm was re-built by John and Mary Proctor, 181 6. Mr. Cunliffe- Kay owns much property here. Beacon Hill House is a modern mansion, belonging to Mrs. Popplewell. Near it is Beamsley Beacon, or Howber Hill, where beacons blazed in Napoleon's day. The prospect is immense. Bolton Abbey is nestled at the foot. Currer Hall, in Beamsley, takes its name from the old family. It is just across the boundary beck. There is a very ancient, deep, narrow, overgrown lane leads to West Hall, and the Black Foss, a pretty water fall, overhung with honey-suckle, will be heard as you pass down the lane. This, and Fairy Dell, on the Middleton side, are the most charming spots that can be imagined. West Hall, near which, anciently, stood Nesfield Mill, was the former mansion of the Ferrands, but is now an ordinary farmhouse. Mr. Cunliffe-Kay, of Godmersham Park, Kent, is owner, and he must be responsible for any lack of information as to this ancient homestead."], [315, "jjhg A n c i ' o 1 1 s <f o r J^,y d diet on* -Dr/r _, i"], [316, ""], [317, "modern ilkley. 277 John Seller's map, in Camden, gives \u2014 Bolton, W.

In these names we see the footsteps of Scandinavian, Anglian, and Danish fore-elders. A buxom damsel, from a cottage on the Addingham side, is supposed to attend to the ferry. The boundary between Ilkley and Addingham is \" Old Thomas Rushforth beck.\" Mr. Cunliffe Lister, of Broughton Hall, owns much property here. Nether Woodhouse, sometimes called Crawshey, from a former owner, is the residence of Mr. Darlington, successor to Mr. Greenwood. The Woodhouses and Holling Hall have been treated upon in a special chapter. The Hawksworths paid \u00a340 rent for Holling Hall a century ago ; the Ellis family pay \u00a3300. The island in the river is named Cockan. Heber's Ghyll, or Black Beck, a narrow gully from Rombalds Moor, is a favourite retreat for visitors. Seventy sheep perished at Holling Hall, on the 18th of June, 1872, by a sudden flood. Several cottages near have been allowed to fall to decay. A stone, in a fence, bears date \u2014 1679. T. H.

It is proposed in the following resume to describe briefly the physical features of the country in the immediate vicinity of Ilkley ; the geological formations which are comprised in the rock series forming the surface, with such explanation as shall be necessary to render clear the method of their aggregation ; and to account for the present configuration of the country. So far as possible, the remarks will be confined to the Parish of Ilkley ; but in many instances it will be necessary to extend the observations beyond those limits, so as to obtain a comprehensive and clear view of the physical and geological features of the district. These remarks apply also to the chapters on the Botany and Fauna, which follow."], [329, "Oeologg of Jlfeleg LKLEY is situated on the banks of the river Wharfe, about equi-distant from its source, and its confluence with the Ouse, near Cawood. The valley in the immediate vicinity of Ilkley is closed in on three sides by hills. On the North and Westwards, they are gently undulating and park-like ; on the South, their rough and rocky slopes are crowned with precipitous escarp- ments, which form their summit. Eastwards, towards Otley, the valley widens and opens out towards Guiseley. The slopes of the hills on either side the valley descend to a level portion rarely more than half a mile in width, along which flows the beautiful river Wharfe : at one time glittering and sparkling as its waters rush over a shallow bed of rounded boulders; at another, deep, silent, and seemingly almost without motion, its glassy surface reflects the beauties of the surrounding scenery like a mirror. Its course is divided between long level flats, only a few feet above the bed of the river, mostly composed of sand, and liable during flood time to an increase, deposited from the waters of the swollen stream. These sands consti tute the most recent alluvium, but besides these there are extensive terraces rising above the bed of the river to a height of 25 or 30 feet. The latter are composed of sandy clay, full of rounded stones in their lower part, with generally a stratum of gravel forming the surface. These are river terraces of older date than the preceding, and are now subject to a gradual process of denudation by the river, giving place to those of lower level and more recent origin. The slopes bounding the valley on either side are deeply cut by streams descending from the hills above. Under ordinary circum stances, they are simply little rills of water, but occasionally, after heavy rain, they are subject to \"spates,\" and a rapid rise in the water causes it to rush down from the moorlands with an impetuosity sufficiently powerful to carry forward large blocks of stone, or other material which may chance to impede their progress. Where their course traverses a bed of sandstone, a miniature waterfall occurs, caused by the hard sandstone offering a greater resistance to the abrading action of the"], [330, "IV ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. water than the shales above or below can do. The sides of the streams are in most cases thickly grown with trees ; this, taken in con junction with the numerous plantations of trees, and the intermediate areas of grass land, gives the country a beautifully sylvan and park-like appearance, especially on the Northern side of the river. The upper part of the hills, on the slopes of which are Denton, Middleton, Nesfield, and Langbar, extend in undulating moorlands far to the North wards, to Poxstones Moor, and the valley of the Washburn. South of the Wharfe, the hill side beneath the great escarpment of grit-rock extending along Addingham and Ilkley edges, towards Burley, is in great part covered with masses of stones, which have fallen from the superincumbent rocks ; great landslips have also taken place ; the Hanging Rocks, or Cow and Calf, have been detached from the parent bed of grit, forming the chief escarpment, by a pair of faults, and altogether the hillside in many portions presents an appearance of wild ruggedness, and under certain aspects, of grandeur and sublimity, which can be rarely equalled. From the summit of the Ilkley grit escarpment, which is 1,000 to i, ioo feet above the sea level, there extends successive plateaux of moorland, the surface of which is composed of sandstones, with inter mediate beds of shale rising in tiers to a height of 1,323 feet. The grit-rocks occupy the surface of the moors for a distance of four or five miles, where they are surmounted by the coal measures of Baildon Common. In the opposite direction, across the Silsden Valley, are the lowest members of the Millstone grit series, which rise with a gradual slope from Silsden and Addingham to the summit of the escarpments overlooking Skipton and Draughton. Cropping out on the sides of the hill beneath the escarpments, are the Yoredale shales and limestones. The surface of Rombalds Moor, where not absolutely bare rock, is covered with heather, grass, or bog-mosses, the decay of which produces peat ; the latter is rarely very thick, often only a few inches. The moors serve for the pasturage of sheep, and the breeding and rearing of grouse or other game. Ilkley has always been famous for its delightful situation, the pic turesque beauty of its surroundings, its health-restoring springs of pure water, and the cheerful, invigorating effects of its atmosphere. From early British times to the present, there has been no period when the town was not. On the South side of the river, there are still preserved the earthworks of an old Roman camp, and these were probably erected near the site of a much earlier British encampment ; such an one is mentioned by Ptolemy, as Olicana, a name derived, as Prof. Phillips suggests, from the British word Llecan \u2014 a rock. After the advent of the Romans, it still continued to be known by the same name. The town forms an agreeable centre for visiting some of the finest Yorkshire scenery. Bolton Woods and Abbey, Skipton Castle, Malham Cove and Gordale Scar, the bold crag of Kilnsey, Harrogate, and picturesque Knaresborough, with the lovely scenery of the Washburn, the Wharfe's"], [331, "GEOLOGY OF ILKLEY. V largest tributary, are all within easy distance; added to these that the valley of the Wharfe is unsurpassed for its varied beauties and noble proportions. Rising amongst the peaks of some of Yorkshire's grandest mountains, its initiatory rills have channelled the slopes of Fountains Fell, Peny Ghent, and Cam Fell, as well as Buckden Pike and Great Whernside, all more than 2,000 feet above the sea-level. The course of the streams, which lower down, combine, and form the Wharfe, is amongst moorland tracts of country, covered with bogs and thick beds of peat, surmounted on all sides by the precipitous summits of mountains, each, except Cam Fell, capped by thick bedded Mill stone grit-rocks. Below Deepdale, the river has carved its channel deep into the rock, which is one composed of Mountain Limestone ; on all sides are lofty escarpments, overlooking pastures of bright green grass on each side of the river. The scenery is wild and romantic, escarpments and grassy slopes succeeding each other in varied alterna tions, as the hard limestone or the softer shale happens to pre dominate. At Kilnsey, the Wharfe and the Skirfare join, and enter on a tract of country gradually merging into some of the most beautiful sylvan scenery in the county. Its beauties have been sung by England's greatest poet of nature, Wordsworth. Scott also has given us his entranced experience in immortal verse ; and Turner, the master mind in the depiction of the poetic beauties of natural scenery, has revelled in its ever-varying effects of colour, and light and form. The great Limestone Scar at Kilnsey forms a feature in the landscape at once magnificent in its grand proportions, and awe-inspiring from the associations it recalls in the past history of the globe. The crag forms a fitting termination to the great lines of Scars extending many miles to the Westward, and embracing those at Gordale and Malham Cove, in the Aire Valley. These rocky cliffs mark the line of the Craven Fault and its branches, and may, since their elevation, have formed the shore of some ancient sea. Extending beyond these cliffs is a large extent of country, covered in great part with \"pavements.\" These are composed of extensive plateaux of limestone, cracked or jointed in every direc tion, like a dried-up clay-field. The joints have been enlarged by the dissolving action of water with carbonic acid in solution on the lime stone, and form deep crevices, in which nestle a few plants and ferns, their bright green fronds in beautiful contrast with the grey limestone. Lower down, the valley widens about Grassington, and a broad expansion to the South-west connects it with the valley of the Aire by way of Cracoe and Rylstone. On reaching Burnsall, the character of the scenery again changes ; the Mountain Limestone area is left behind, and the river enters the Millstone Grit District, which reaches as far Eastwards as Harewood. The beautiful sylvan scene:ry of Barden and Bolton Woods has been immortalized by Rogers and Wordsworth, and must be seen to be thoroughly appreciated. The river is confined in"], [332, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. VI Bolton Woods to a narrow channel cut through the solid rocks, and at the Strid is so narrow that an active person may leap across. It was here that young Romilly with his hound lost his life \u2014 \" He sprang in glee \u2014 for what cared he That the river was strong and the rocks were steep ? But the greyhound in the leash hung back, And checked him in his leap. \" \u2014 Wordsworth. The hill sides are thickly wooded, and above rise the gritstone hills of Earl's Seat, 1,474 feet, and Simon's Seat to 1,592 feet. Thence, the river passes Bolton Abbey, where the Yoredale shales are again brought to the surface for a short distance, and E.S.E. to Addingham and Ilkley, Otley and Harewood, its course through this district being characterized by the slopes of shale and thinner grit-rocks, and the huge escarpments of thick grits of Ilkley and Otley Chevin. After passing Harewood, the river enters a tract of Permian Limestone, running by Wetherby, Thorparch, and Tadcaster, and thence to the Ouse, across the flat country of the vale of York, composed of New Red Sandstone. UPHEAVAL AND DISPLACEMENT OF THE STRATA. To understand the geological features of the district, it will be necessary to consider its relation to the surrounding parts of the country ; and also the position of its component rocks in the geological scale. The geological strata present in the West Riding of Yorkshire comprise the Silurian system of its North-western, and the New Red Sandstone occupying its South-eastern extremities ; including the two, there is the following series of Strata : \u2014 Trias, or New Red Sandstone. Permian Limestones and Marls. Upper Coal Measures. Lower Coal Measures. Millstone Grits. Yoredale Series. Mountain Limestone and Red Conglomeratis. Silurian System. The strata of the country in the Parish of Ilkley are entirely com posed of the Millstone Grit group of rocks. A few miles further Westwards the Yoredale series occur, on the slopes of the deep declivity beneath Skipton Moor on the North side, whilst at Baildon, a couple of miles Southwards, there is an outlying hill of Lower Coal Measure rocks. In the Wharfe Valley, overlying the Millstone Grit rocks which form its base, there are extensive deposits of alluvial sands and gravels, which are of quite recent, or comparatively modern date. The Millstone Grits of Yorkshire may be divided into four groups, as follows : \u2014 Lower Coal Measures \u2014 i. \u2014 Rough Rock, or First Grit. Shales, sometimes absent, occasionally with a thin seam of coal. 2. \u2014 The Second Grit. A sandstone, generally fine grained and flaggy. Shales, with coal in the lower part."], [333, "GEOLOGY OF ILKLEY. VII 3. \u2014 Third Grits. The most variable group of the series. Shales, with beds of coal of local extent. 4. \u2014 Kinderscout Grits, or Fourth Grits. Yoredale Series. The Millstone Grit rocks extend Eastwards and Southwards from the Ilkley district, and form a great basin-shaped trough, in which are superposed the several members composing the measures of the York shire coal-field. On the opposite side of the Penine Chain of Hills, the coal-field of Oldham and Manchester occupies a similar hollow, and it is probable that the Lancashire and Yorkshire coal-fields were originally deposited on one even plain. The arrangement and character of the rocks, shales, and coals of the two areas may be said to have a great similarity, and though on account of the variability of the constituent beds, the strata cannot in all cases be correlated with each other, still, with respect to the lower members, the Millstone Grits, and the Elland Flag rock of the Lower Coal Measures, there is an unmistakable relationship. As now easting, the two coal-fields are divided by the Penine Chain of Hills, sometimes called the backbone of England This extends in a North and South direction, its summit forming the boundary between the counties. The strata have been forced into the form of an anticlinal by a lateral pressure, causing the upper portions to become broken and separated over ever-increasing areas. The action of denuding agencies has since removed immense quantities of material from the surface, and so the coal-fields have come to be separated by a distance many miles in extent. The Millstone Grits, as well as the rocks higher in the series along the Penine Anticlinal, dip or slope in an Easterly direction. Further Northwards, in the neighbour hood of Ilkley, the dip slope is South-easterly, and in the county East from this, and North of Leeds, the dip is Southerly. The disturbances which have caused the change in the direction of the dip, are due to a long line of faults extending from Ingleton to Knaresborough, or beyond ; they are called the Craven Faults, and their action has been so great that a displacement of between 2,000 and 3,000 feet in vertical extent has been caused by them. Their course is marked by the precipitous scars of Mountain Limestone, extending from Giggleswiek, Settle, Malham and Gordale, to Kilnsey ; and some idea of the magni tude of the faults may be formed, when it is remembered that the coal field of Ingleton was at one time higher than the top of Ingleborough by several hundreds of feet. A secondary result of the displacement by the Craven Faults has been, that a number of anticlinals or foldings of the strata have been formed. They extend generally from the line of fault in a South-westerly direction. One of the most important brings up the Mountain Limestone at Clitheroe, Thornton, and Skipton, and continues Eastward to Draughton and Bolton. The Limestone rises at Skipton, in the centre of the valley, bent over in the form of an anti clinal, and is very extensively quarried Dipping from the Limestone, are thick beds of Yoredale Shales, with intermediate thin Limestones,"], [334, "VIII ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. and above these, the Gritstone escarpments, forming the edges of the Embsay Moors on the North, and those of Skipton on the South. The Gritstones are the lowest members of the Millstone Grit series, and underlie those of Rombalds Moor. The Grit of Skipton Moors is the Kinderscout, or Fourth Grit. It extends Eastwards to Addingham, the bed of the river being cut through its rocks. On the opposite side of the valley, the hills about Langbar and Beamsley are composed of Kinderscout Grit, and thence it forms the surface at High Denton, Askwith Moor, and Weston Moor. The dip of the rocks from Adding ham, Eastwards, is towards the South ; and of those on Skipton Moor, South-east. The Kinderscout Grits, which rise to a height of 900 to 1,000 feet, on the Skipton and Beamsley moors, disappear in the valley running from Silsden to Addingham, and are overlaid by the shales and sandstones of the Third Grits. The principal member of this group is the thick bed of grit which extends from White Crag, along Addingham Edge, past Ilkley and the Hanging Rocks, to Otley Chevin. It forms the boldest feature in the scenery of this part of Wharfedale, and is altogether the most important rock in the Third Grits. There are two or three beds of sandstone above and below it, which give rise to minor features in the contour of the hill slopes, the latter, however, being principally composed of beds of shale. Rising again above the Third Grit beds is another, which forms the undulating plateau-like surface of Rombalds Moor. The latter is the Rough Rock, the uppermost mem ber of the Millstone Grit series. It attains a height, at a point South of Ilkley, of 1,323 feet, but dipping rapidly to the S.E., this height is diminished to about 700 feet at Baildon Common, where the Rough Rock forms the base of an outline of the Lower Coal Measures, which rise above it to a height of 927 feet It will be seen, from a consideration of these statements, that the upheaval of the Penine Chain of hills running North and South, and the displacements and anticlinals caused by the Great Craven Faults extending from the Penine anticlinal Eastward at right angles, have resulted in an inclination of the strata of the lowest beds exposed, forming a hollow or trough in which the succeeding strata are arranged in concentric layers, the uppermost beds being the various members of the Coal Measures. The Millstone Grits comprised within the area under more especial consideration, form a segment of this circular trough, the Kinder Grits being the lowest members of the series of concentric layers, the several shales and sandstones of the Third Grits and Rough Rock being superimposed ; all these in turn dipping beneath the surface, and giving place to the Coal Measures. CHARACTER AND COMPOSITION OF THE MILLSTONE GRITS. In all the members of this group of rocks, there is the utmost pos sible variation in composition and structure. They were first studied and worked out in Derbyshire, near the limit of their Southern exten sion. Their arrangement in that district is perhaps simpler than in any"], [335, "GEOLOGY OF ILKLEY. IX other. The Fourth Grits, named Kinderscout Grits, from their occur rence on the part of the Peak so named, consists of two beds of massive rock, with a mass of shales between them. The Third Grits comprise only two beds of sandstone, with intermediate shales and the Rough rock, with a bed of flagstones, representing the Second Grits, at its base. Their total thickness is about 2,000 feet. In their progress Northward, the utmost variation occurs in the Third Grits. In some localities, the group is reduced almost to a single bed of grit, whilst in others, as for example in the district West of Sheffield, there are four or five beds of rock with intermediate shales. In the moorland dis tricts West of Huddersfield and Halifax, there are four well defined beds of sandstone included in the Third Grits. The greatest develop ment, however, occurs in the valley of the Wharfe, the central feature being the thick, massive Addingham Grit Above it, there are three thinner beds of sandstone, and below, two or three others. The Addingham Edge Grit is probably the equivalent of the Plumpton and Spofforth Grit, and also of the Grit on whose surface are perched the weathered rocks of Brimham. Throughout its whole extent, it is a thick-bedded coarse grit, often of a red colour, as at Plumpton and Spofforth. The colour of the Addingham beds is often a deep red, which, by exposure and weathering, turns a lighter or yellow colour. It is jointed in a peculiar manner, so that if the shales supporting it, by any means become removed, the rock falls away in cubical masses, leaving a further exposure of a perpendicular, unbroken wall of rock. It is in this manner that the bold escarpments, which form so charac teristic a feature in the scenery of a Millstone Grit country, have been formed. The Kinderscout Grits are more equally persistent than the Third Grits. They have probably been deposited on an uneven surface of earlier rocks, and in many places have filled up hollows, so that their thickness in different districts is very unequal. North of Ilkley, these rocks occupy a very large area, and where sections can be met with, it is seen that the Kinderscout Grit is very largely developed in thick ness, as well as in extent of surface. It is thicker in this district than in any other ; but the rock is separated into several beds by thin beds of shale. Between the Kinder Grit, and the shales and limestones of the Yoredale Series, there is another bed of sandstone with shales, the equivalent of the Pendle Hill, or Yoredale Grit. This, with the Kin derscout Grit above, has a total thickness of 1,800 feet. The Rough Rock, or First Grit, preserves a uniform character and thickness which is astonishing. It has an average thickness of about 100 feet, and is found, without exception, encircling the coal-field from Derbyshire to Leeds, a few miles E.N.E. of which town it disappears beneath the Permian Limestone. Everywhere it has the same character; it is a coarse sandstone, with large pebbles of rolled quartz and grains of sand, the angular edges of the pebbles and sand have been removed by attrition, they are generally cemented together by decomposed fel- BB."], [336, "X ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. spar. It is the uppermost bed of the Millstone Grits, and its great extent, and the regularity of its occurrence and thickness, have rendered it the best horizon to fix as a datum line for ascertaining the position of other rocks, and for this purpose it is generally used. \" There is some difficulty in realizing how this regularity and uniformity could have been brought about, but it is probable that such a bed as this was not deposited in its present form to begin with, but that its materials have been re-arranged over and over again, before they became finally spread out into the sheet they now form. Of the many ways in which the transfer may have been effected, it will be sufficient to suggest one. If a bank of coarse sand has been piled up in shallow water along a shore, and is then raised up to or above the surface of the water by oscillation of the land, it will be wholly or in part worn down again by denudation, and transferred to the water adjoining the new shore line; if the second bank be again elevated, it will in the same way travel a step farther in the same direction. By continuing the gradual elevation always in the same direction, the materials can be carried to any distance, and a sandbank established far away from the rock from whose waste it was originally derived. Now, suppose submergence to ensue till the water reaches up to the rocky coast line with which we started, and let the process of transferring a second bank of sand, by gradual elevation and continued denudation be repeated, we shall get a second bank established somewhere in the neighbourhood of the first. In this way the water would in time become full of banks of coarse material, and the denuding action of the waves during repeated eleva tions and depressions, would wash these banks down, and tend to re arrange their materials in a sheet approximately uniform in thickness.\"* We have glanced at the physical features of the district of which Ilkley forms the centre, and their relation to the tract of country drained by the Wharfe, and also considered the internal forces which have resulted in the upheaval of the surface, so as to form a series of anti clinals with a strike N. and S. along the Penine Chain of hills, and from them E. and W., a second anticlinal, dependent, probably entirely, but if not, to a very large extent, on the displacement caused by the Great Craven Faults ; also how these great upheavals have separated the coal fields of Yorkshire and Lancashire, once united, and formed them into basin-shaped hollows, the highest members of the series occupying the centre. It is now necessary, before proceeding to a de tailed description of the rocks in the immediate vicinity of Ilkley, to attempt an explanation of the method by which the sandstones and shales have been aggregated. METHOD IN WHICH THE STRATA HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED. If an extended section of Grit-rocks and Shales be examined, it will be found that they do not preserve a homogeneous structure for any great distance, but that they are made up of long wedge-shaped masses, * The Geology of the Yorkshire Coal Field, p. 17."], [337, "GEOLOGY OF ILKLEY. XI \u2666 which, beginning at a point, gradually increase in thickness for some distance, and then re-diminish and disappear, being dovetailed in with, or giving place to, other similar lenticular masses. It will also be found that this irregularity in the plains of bedding is not confined to the sandstones. It is a common occurrence to find a bed of sandstone or grit thin out rapidly and disappear, its place being taken by one or more beds of shale. A stratum of shale in another place becomes gradually impregnated with grains of fine sand, and almost imper- ceptibly takes the character of an ordinary rough sandstone. There is in many sandstone beds a gradual change from a rough, coarse-grained grit, most irregularly current-bedded, and composed of large, thick angular-jointed masses, to a finer-grained, thinner-bedded sandstone, and still lower, to close, compact, finely-grained rock, which can be split up into evenly-bedded flagstones or slates. Characters of this kind may be frequently observed in the uppermost member of the Millstone Series, the 3Rough Rock, which occupies the highest ground on Rom- balds Moor, and is extensively quarried at its escarpments of the oppo- site side of the moor from Ilkley. The upper beds of this rock, com- posed of coarse-grained pebbly grit, are used for paving and for building, where heavy, durable blocks are required, and for the solid masonry for engine beds. The lower part is the flagstone of the Second Grit, sometimes immediately beneath the Rough Rock, and without any perceptible line of division, though perhaps more frequently separated by a thickness of shale. The grand principle enunciated by Sir Charles Lyell, \" that similar forces to those now in operation on the surface of the earth, are suffi- cient to account for all the phenomena of past geological ages,\" is one which at once, the most beautiful and comprehensive, has done more than any other discovery, not only to advance geological science, but to simplify and enforce the great laws of evolution as applied to living organisms, since propounded by Charles Darwia It is the application of this principle which renders clear the processes by which all the car- boniferous rocks were formed or aggregated At the present time rivers convey the sediment derived from the disintegration of the sandstones, and other strata, to the sea, the quantity removed annually from the area drained by the river Wharfe may be estimated in a rough way as follows :\u2014 The greater part of this large quantity of solid matter is borne to the sea during periods of flood, when immense volumes of water rush with impetuous force down innumerable little becks or streamlets. These, ramifying in every direction down the steep hill sides, carry with them the sand and mud which have accumulated since a previous flood, into the Wharfe. Large boulders are rolled along by the force of the current, and become rounded and worn by the constant attrition. Thousands of them may be seen along the bed of the river, large and massive near its source, becoming smaller by the attrition to which they are subjected in their course towards the sea. The stones, sand, and mud, on reaching the mouth of the river, become gradually spread along"], [338, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. XII the shore of the sea, or carried by the force of the current and deposited in deeper water. The heavier grains of sand, so soon as the force which has impelled them along the narrow channel of the river becomes weakened over the larger area of the estuary, and by impact with the waters of the sea, sink to the bottom, and form a bank at the mouth of the river ; those of less size and lighter weight are carried further to sea, but in their turn fall to the bottom, whilst the fine particles of mud are borne by the enfeebled current far out to sea, and spread over an ever widening area of the sea bottom. The fine mud, carried seawards, and sinking in the deepest water, will be less liable to be disturbed by the waves and tides, and so to preserve its original lines of deposition, than the sand near the shore, whilst the latter, subject to the action of every tide, is still more rolled about and spread along the coast, forming eventually sandbanks, extending along the whole extent of the shore. Examples will occur to the mind of the reader, on the coast of York shire, not only is the shore formed of the sand derived from the dis integration of the surface of the county, but extensive banks of sand exist far out in the shallow waters of the German Ocean, and there can be little doubt, that these also are of similar derivation. On the West coast, large tracts of what was once sea coast have been reclaimed, and are now under cultivation. Besides these, the extensive sands of More cambe Bay, which extends seawards for miles when the tide is down, are examples of the result of the denudation of the land, principally derived from the hills of Westmoreland and Cumberland. Before leaving this part of the subject, it may be well to give a simple instance of the way in which the deposition of the sands and clays may be studied on a small scale. If a tall beaker, or glass, one foot in length, be filled with the muddy water from the Wharfe during a freshet, or flood, and placed so that the solid ingredients can quietly subside, a representation on a small scale will be obtained of what actually takes place at the mouth of a river. The larger grains of sand will speedily fall, and form a layer or stratum over the bottom of the glass. Dr. Sorby, in the presidential address to the Microscopical Society, in 1877, has given the result of some careful experiments in this direction. He found that grains of sand i&0 of an inch in diameter, require ten seconds to fall one foot, whilst there is every gradation to the finest mud, which took five days to descend the same depth. By this experi ment, it will be seen that every gradation from a coarse sand to the most impalpable mud, may be derived from the same source. Having traced the action which is at present in never-ceasing opera tion, it will be necessary to apply it to the elucidation of the formation of sandstones and shales of the Millstone Grit rocks. It has been observed that the sandstones occur in beds which are made up of horizontally elongated masses, which thin out to a wedge-shaped point in every direction ; that the divisions between the layers do not extend in even parallel lines for more than a short distance. This is exactly the character that the beds or sandbanks now forming will have ; whilst"], [339, "GEOLOGY OF ILKLEY. XIII in the same way the mud carried out to the deep water, and gently sub siding, is forming evenly-bedded horizontal layers, extending over large areas at the present day, so the shales between the sandstones are in most instances bound to be evenly bedded over large areas. The sand stones are composed of grains of Quartz cemented together by some other material, frequently a mixture of clay or alumina, and felspar. Iron, in greater or less quantity, is nearly always present. Where it occurs in large proportion, it causes the rocks to assume a red, or pur ple colour, as in the case of the Plumpton Grits, and to a smaller extent, in the Addingham Edge Grit. The shales are made up of clay, sometimes mixed with sand, or other substances. Dr. Sorby, in the ad dress already referred to, observed that it rarely happens that a complete separation of the sand and clay takes place. The sand, in its descent amongst the suspended particles of mud or clay, nearly always takes with it a quantity which adhere to its surface. There can be no doubt that this fact accounts for the frequent admixture of sand with the shales, and vice versa, for the presence, to some extent, of the cementing material amongst the grains of sand. If a piece of sandstone be examined with a magnifying power, it will be found that the grains of quartz are rounded, the corners have been rubbed or ground off. This will be still more apparent in the rough grits, containing pebbles of quartz, though frequently of large size, one or two inches in diameter ; they are well rounded, and present a smooth and polished surface. All this is evidently due to, and is caused by, the same kind of attrition to which the sand and gravel in our rivers and sea coasts are subject at the present day. Besides the grains and pebbles of quartz with the cementing mass of decomposed felspar, there may frequently be detected small plates of mica ; in some of the more flaggy beds of sandstone the mica exists in large quantities, and thickly coats the planes of bedding. The three minerals enumerated are the principal constituents of granite, and it is far more than probable that the Millstone Grit rocks of this district have been derived from the decomposition and disintegration of granitic rocks. Prof. Green, in the \" Geology of the Yorkshire Coal Field,\" drawing largely on the results of the microscopic labours of Dr. Sorby, says on this subject \u2014 \"The materials of which the sandstones are com posed have evidently been furnished by the wear and tear of some crystalline rock, such as Granite. It is not uncommon to find in the coarser rocks, lumps, and even crystals, still retaining their outline and cleavage, of Orth\u0153lase only slightly decomposed, and these are some times present in considerable quantity. The rock has then so granitic a look that it might easily be mistaken by an inexperienced observer for granite.\"* The quartz grains are some of them glassy, like the quartz of many granites, others, and most of the larger pebbles are of milk-white quartz, such as occurs in veins. The rough usage to which the materials have been subjected, has frequently all but destroyed the * It may have been this resemblance which led Charlotte Bronte into the mistake of describing the rocks of her native moors as granite."], [340, "XIV ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. mica, but this mineral is seldom altogether absent even from the coarsest beds, and in the more finely-grained laminated rocks, the planes of bedding are thickly coated with it. Mr. Sorby has noted the occasional occurrence of actual pebbles of crystalline rock in the Mill stone Grit of Yorkshire, and has shown that the granite from which that rock was derived, resembled the granites of Norway more closely than any British variety of that rock. Nothing, hitherto, has been said of the formation of Coal. It does not enter largely into the composition of the rocks in this district ; but there are two or three beds included in the Millstone Grits of Rombalds Moor, and as already remarked, the coal measures are represented at the S.E. extremity of the moor. Nor has the origin of the Limestone, which exists in considerably quantity N.W. of Ilkley, been mentioned. Limestone is a product from the deeper sea. Most of the Yorkshire limestones are made up to a great extent of the calcareous protections of marine animals. Minute Foraminifera are the greatest agents in producing limestone, but others of larger size, like Corals are abundant, shells of Molluscous animals equally so, Encrinites, and many other forms are also common. The Limestone of Thorpe Fells, a few miles North of Ilkley, is largely composed of well preserved fossil shells, and fossil remains are not uncommon at Skipton. Beyond the extent to which the mud brought to the sea by rivers, or resulting from the breaking up of the sea coasts will reach, the limestones were accumu lated. In many cases, the shales and the limestones overlap and dove tail with each other, and it follows that their accumulation at the sea bottom was proceeding together, sometimes the limestone-producing creatures were forced back by a greater than usual influx of mud ; at others, they were able to encroach nearer the shore. It will also be evident that where there is a great thickness of pure limestone, it was probably accumulated far out to sea in deep water, but where there are interlaminations of shale or sandstone, or the limestone contains an arenaceous or argillaceous admixture, it must have been deposited near the shore of some land surface. The successive depositions of sand and mud at the mouths of rivers, or along the old coast lines during the carboniferous age, would gradually accumulate until a delta was formed, and thus the land surface be extended out seawards, or it is possible that slight elevations of the land occurred. So soon as either of these events happened, the exposed beds of sand would become hardened, and vegetation extend over their surface. It is probable that many of the beds of coal are the result of dense growth of vegetation, such as may be found in the swamps and lagoons of Africa or America at the present day. Such swamps may well have existed during the period immediately succeeding the eleva tion of the land, and a luxuriant vegetation have been the result. During the long ages following, the decay of this vegetable matter, pressure, and chemical change, have produced the substance we know as coal. An analagous instance, under different circumstances, may be"], [341, "GEOLOGY OF ILKLEY. XV studied in the growth of heather and other plants on the Gritstone moors. The decay of the heather produces peat, and though this peat is not very thick on the moors South of Ilkley, numerous districts might be cited where the peat has attained a thickness of ten or twelve feet ; and it is extremely probable that should this be buried under successive sandstones and shales, that at some future time it would become coal. Underlying the coal seam, there is generally a bed of seat-earth ; this is a fine silicious clay or stone which is very valuable for making fire bricks, and similar objects. Throughout the seat-earth, the Stigmarian roots of the plants which flourished on the surface are abundantly found. In some instances, the roots have been found connected with the trunks of trees standing erect in the coal, just as the trunk of a tree is sometimes found in the peat, whose roots ramify in the thin soil, separating the peat from the rock below. Circumstances of this kind prove that the coal still occupies the position held by the plants whose growth and decay produced it. The number of the alternating beds of shale, sandstone, and coal with its seat-earth is very large, and it follows as a natural sequence that during the period they were being accumulated, there were repeated up heavals and subsidences of the land, because, as explained, the shales and sandstones were formed under water, whilst the coals are the result of land vegetation. Every bed of coal, however thin, represents a period when the tract of land over which it extends was above water, and each bed of sandstone or shale above it proves that there was a subsidence of that land beneath the water for a sufficiently long time to allow of the accumulation of the detritus of older rocks sufficient for its formation. During the Millstone Grit age, the land was principally under water, and it was only during rare intervals that it appeared above the surface, and an accumulation of vegetable matter took place. But later on, when the coal measures were in process of formation, though there were very similar conditions, the relative periods of submergence were much changed, and the land surfaces were not only much more extensive, but the upheavals were more numerous, and of longer dura tion. They would appear also to have been more uniform over large areas. It is very surprising to find the coals which occur at Baildon, the Halifax Hard and Soft bed coals, extending on the same horizon over the whole extent of the Yorkshire Coal-field, with a similarity in character and composition that makes their identification certain. The circumstances rendering possible so large and even strata of coal during the formation of the coal measures, did not obtain during the deposition of the Millstone Grit rocks below the Rough Rock. In fact, the latter is the lowest bed which presents an even surface extending over a large area, on which the beds of the coal measures could be so equally deposited as they are now found. The Millstone Grit coals are of local extent, proving that the land surfaces only existed in small patches, where plants could grow, probably surrounded by shifting sandbanks, which caused its speedy submergence. cc"], [342, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. XVI THE MOUNTAIN LIMESTONE AND YOREDALE SERIES. The Mountain Limestone and Yoredale Rocks do not occur nearer to Ilkley than the valley of Skibeden, reaching from Skipton in Airedale to Bolton in Wharfedale. This cross valley has been formed by the upheaval, in the form of an anticlinal, of the Mountain Limestone, and the separation and subsequent denudation of the overlying strata. At Haw Park, near Skipton, the limestone is very largely quarried. It forms the base of the valley towards Bolton ; about half a mile from the Devonshire Arms there are quarries on each side of the anticlinal. In a large quarry on the Southern side of the road, the limestone is much contorted ; the bedding of a large portion is nearly perpendicular. The limestone is dark grey, or black in colour, thinly bedded, with inter stratifications of shale ; on the opposite side of the road are quarries, in which the limestone dips to the N.W. The valley is bounded on the North by the gritstone escarpments of Embsay Moor, whilst on the South are similar escarpments beneath Skipton and Draughton Moors. Between the Mountain Limestone, in the centre of the valley, and the gritstones, there is a somewhat variable series of beds of shale, lime stone, and sandstone, which are in all probability the equivalents of the Yoredale series further North. Several of these beds are exposed in the sides of the tramway which has been cut through them trom the Haw Park quarries towards Skipton. The beds have a dip, varying from 35\u00b0 to 6o\u00b0 South. Above the thick limestone is a great thickness of black shales : resting on these are laminated arenaceous shales, con taining flakes of mica, fine mudstones, and close-grained limestone and calcareous shales. The limestones are hard, and contain a large num ber of comminuted remains of Corals, Branchiopods, Bryozoa, and Encrinites ; fishes' teeth have been found, though rarely. Above the shales is a second bed of limestone, 50 feet in thickness, with a dip of 38\u00b0 to the Southwards. There is a bed of limestone on the North side the valley, extending a httle below East Halton, which forms a ridge easily traceable towards Bolton ; above the limestone are shales which may be studied in the beds of the streams descending from Embsay Moors. These reach up to the sandstone, which is extensively quarried along its escarpment. On the flank of the Southern hills, there is, immediately below the Kinder Grit, a bed of sandstone which is finer grained, often of a brownish colour. This is probably the equivalent of the Pendle Grit, and consequently has been described as a member of the Yoredale series. Recently the Geological Survey regarded it as a basement member of the Kinderscout Grits. Along with the shales which separate it from the thick bedded Kinder Grit of Skipton Moor; the Pendle series is about 600 feet in thickness. The limestones are exposed in several quarries along the valley, but perhaps the finest example of contorted strata occurs in a small quarry at Draughton, where the thin bedded, dark coloured limestone is bent without breaking, so as to form two anticlinals connected by a synclinal axis in the form of a letter M."], [343, "GEOLOGY OF ILKLEY. XVII The Yoredale Shales are exposed on the bank of the Wharfe at Bolton Abbey, dipping to the N.W. 30\u00b0. They are considerably contorted, ferruginous and dark-coloured, with thin bands of stone intermixed. Similar shales, also much rolled about, but having a general dip in the opposite direction, viz., to the S.E. 25\u00b0, may be seen about half-a mile from Bolton Bridge, where the Addingham Road is cut through them. Overlying the shales is a bed of Brownish Red Sandstone. It is probable that the axis of the anticlinal passes between these two ex posures, apparently near Bolton Bridge, and is continued under Beamsley Beacon. The high road between Bolton and Blubberhouses in the Valley of the Washburn passes along Kex Gill. After passing the highest part of the moor the road proceeds down a gorge, on each side of which the Kinderscout Grits form precipitous escarpments. Near the top of this gorge the limestone, doubtless forming the summit of an anti clinal which has brought it near the surface, is worked by adits. Beds of light blue shale and a Calcareous Sandstone also occur, the latter containing large numbers of fossil remains of Brachiopods and other Molluscs. A vein containing Galena has been cut across during the workings. THE KINDERSCOUT OR FOURTH GRIT. The Kinderscout Grits consist of a group of sandstones and shales, with two or three seams of coal. The sandstones in the lower part oi the series are, in many instances, extremely coarse-grained and contain large pebbles of vein-quartz an inch or two in diameter, causing it to have the appearance of a conglomerate ; occasionally there are found in this bed rounded pebbles of an older sandstone, the grains of which are composed of quartz possessing a very translucent appearance. In the upper part of the series the sandstones are finer-grained, sometimes white and silicious. The beds of sandstone and the intermediate shales are very variable in character, and irregular in occurrence and deposition. The sandstones are extensively quarried and are used for a variety of purposes. The silicious beds in the upper parts often make good flags and landings, whilst the coarse-grained massive rock nearer the base of the series is used for purposes where heavy masonry is re quired, for engine-beds or in building harbours. As already observed, the Kinderscout Grit forms an escarpment along the edge of Skipton Moor overlooking that town. This is the lowest bed of grit ; above it are a number of other grits which form a succes sion of smaller escarpments as they crop out along the moor ; between the outcrops of the grits are beds of shale, their position being rather indicated than exposed by swampy hollows, grown over with heather and coarse grass, or covered with peat Towards the Southern extremity of Skipton Moor these grits dip beneath the surface and dis appear. But on the Western end ofthe moor the sequence and character of the rocks can be seen in the broken ground about Bradby and Kild wick. Near the latter place, between the Low and High Farnhill there"], [344, "XVIII ILKLEY: ANCIENT AND MODERN. are quarries in the lower coarse grit and conglomerate which extends thence along the surface of Farnhill Moor. Above this is shale and raggy flag-stone, and then a bed of hard, closely-grained, evenly-bedded flags with partings of dark shale. This may be seen in some disused quarries near Kildwick Hall, in the plantation.* Another thickness of shale succeeds, and above that in the stream-course which runs past Kildwick Grange may be traced six or seven beds of sandstone of various textures with intermediate shales up to Blow Moor Hall Quarry on Kildwick Moor, where there is the upper member of the series, which is a fine-grained sandstone. The series is very changeable, and probably varies from 200 to 2000 feet in thickness. Three or four beds of coal have been worked in the Kinder Grit Series in the neighbourhood of Bradby and Kildwick, but they are now given up, and little information is to be obtained respecting them. Their occurrence can be traced by a number of old pits along the outcrop. It is probable that the coals are not of great extent, and rapidly thin out and disappear from the surrounding area. The escarpment of the Kinder Scout Grit extends from Skipton with little intermission to Beamsley Beacon, from the valley of the Aire to that of the Wharfe, on the opposite side of the Skibeden valley the same grit forms the escarpment of Embsay Moor, and still further Northwards the summits of Rilstone and Barden Fells. Its course, marked by a series of bold crags and rocks, those of Rilstone presenting a remark able resemblance to a volcano when seen from the valley. From the outcrop of the rock on Skipton Moor, it dips in a Southerly direction at an angle of about 20\u00b0. Its upper part forms the dip slope to Addingham Low Moor. Near Marchup the grits are faulted up, pro ducing the ridge of Woofa Bank ; three beds of grit may be identified with intermediate shales, to the Eastwards these abut against shales which extend down to Marchup, and on the West they are in juxtaposition with an undulating mass of thick Kinderscout Grit Beyond the Wharfe from Addingham the Kinderscout Grit forms the slope of Langbar Moor and extends to the summit of Beamsley Beacon. Further Northwards the grit forms a synclinal hollow in which runs Kex Gill Beck. It again rises towards Hazlewood Moor and Bolton Park, culminating in Earl's Seat 1474 feet, and Simon's Seat 1592 feet in height. From these heights the grit rocks dip rapidly in every direction. Towards the West they dip N.W. to the river Wharfe, where they may be seen at the \"Strid.\" A short distance North of Skyreholme their in clination is to the S.E., and from beneath them rise shales and a thick massive white limestone which attains an altitude of 1350 feet, when it is cut off by a fault, stated by Mr. Dakyns to be a continuation of the Great Craven Fault,! running in an E. and W. direction past Skirethorne to Gordale and Malham, and in the opposite direction past Greenhow Hill to Pateley Bridge. * See Geology or the Yorkshire Coalfields, p. 66. t Report British Association, 1873, sections, p. 79."], [345, "GEOLOGY OF ILKLEV. XIX At Kex Gill, four or five miles North of Ilkley, the Kinder Grits are split asunder by the anticlinal which extends from Skipton along the Skibeden valley and past Bolton, on each side the gorge thus formed, the grit rocks form rugged precipitous escarpments with huge, columnar blocks perched in weathered masses along its slopes, or spread along the bottom. On the Kex Gill Moors there are several small quarries in the grit rock, it is a thickly-bedded massive rock, in some places very ferruginous and containing large pebbles of quartz. Remains of plants are abundant at the foot of Beamsley Beacon, an escarpment marks the line of a fault running from the N.W. near Bolton, across the line of the anticlinal of Kex Gill, South-eastwards across the moor. From Langbar the Kinderscout Grit curves round by Hollingley to Denton, and as far South as West Beck. Askwith is built on a bed of the Third Grits, which along with a bed of shale overlie the Kinder Grit. Between Askwith and Weston a North and South Fault brings the Kinderscout Grit to a leve'l with the bed of Third Grits, Weston is on the Kinderscout Grit, and from this place Eastwards to Leathley all the gritstones North of the river Wharfe are of the Kinderscout Series. They have a Southern dip varying from 50\u00b0 at Langbar, 20\u00b0 at Hollingley, 10\u00b0 at Denton, to 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 at Weston. Northwards the Kinderscout Grits form all the surfaces of Denton and Askwith Moors to the valley of the Washburn. They form an undu lating tableland about 1000 feet in height with a slight dip, averaging 3\u00b0 to 6\u00b0 along its Southern slope towards the Wharfe, as stated already, this dip becomes much more rapid nearer the bottom of the valley. THE THIRD OR MIDDLE GRITS. The Middle Grits are the basis of all the principal features of the scenery in the immediate vicinity of Ilkley. They consist of an ex tremely variable series of sandstones with shales between each. The most important rock is the Addingham Edge or Ilkley Rock, which ex tends from White Crag along Addingham High Moor, includes the Hanging Rocks or Cow and Calf, Ilkley Crags, Pancake Rocks, &c, past Burley and along Otley Chevin to Bramhope. It forms a series of scarped edges of grand and splendid proportions along nearly the whole distance. It is a rough and coarse grit, often brown or pinkish in colour ; it is not, however, so coarse as the Lower Kinderscout Grits, and does not become a conglomerate from the occurrence of quartz pebbles. It is very thick-bedded, and divided by joints into huge cubical masses. In some portions of its extent these form a great wall-like escarpment, but in others the blocks of rock lie scattered in desolate profusion over the hill slope below. The Ilkley Grit extends Southward to the Aire Valley from White Crag, thrown down to a lower level by a fault at Burnthwaite Crag. It extends along Spring Wood Crag, separated from Burnthwaite Crag again by a fault running parallel to the former one in a N.W. and S.E. direction. The grit is divided into two parts at Spring Wood Crag ; the lower is a thick-bedded grit, as at Ilkley, whilst the upper part about"], [346, "ILKLEY: ANCIENT AND MODERN. XX 15 or 20 feet thick is composed of flaggy sandstones of a much finer texture. On the opposite side the river valley of the Aire, the two divi sions of the rock become separated by a bed of shale, the upper of which forms the bold cliff called Earl Crag. \" The beds run together due South of Sutton, but in its further course to the South-east the rock be comes split up into three beds. A coarse rock, which, from its character, probably belongs to this part of the series, is quarried at High Utley, and parts of it furnish excellent examples of a gritstone which is evidently pounded-up granite. It consists of quartz and large lumps of partially decomposed Pink Orthoclase, and a block of it might at a casual glance be easily mistaken for a bit of weathered granite. Some of the felspar crystals were scarcely at all rounded and half an inch in length.\"* The Ilkley Grit is extensively quarried for building material along Ilkley Crags and at other places along its escarpment. It has been dis located by faults in several directions. One ofthe most important passes through Ilkley near the Railway Station, in a S.E. direction to the West side of the Cow and Calf. About a quarter of a mile beyond, this fault strikes a second one, which extends on the East side of the Cow and Calf, in a N.E. direction, close to the Ben Rhydding Hotel, across the valley to Denton. The effect of these faults has been to bodily carry a huge square of the Ilkley Grit several hundred yards from its parent rock towards the valley. This mass forms the Hanging Rocks at the end of which are the Cow and Calf. The latter fault has also had a great deal to do with the broken state of the ground on which the Ben Rhydding Establishment is so charmingly situated, and adds greatly to the pictu resque beauty of its immediate surroundings. Below the Ilkley Grit there are three or four sandstones not of great importance or thickness ; they are separated by thick beds of shale, and for this reason they generally form sloping ground, the grits not being of sufficient importance to form any decided feature in the contour of the hill sides. The Second Sandstone beneath the Ilkley Grit forms the small plateau of Addingham Moor side, and its edge forms an escarpment towards the Wharfe. It is quarried in several places ; it is a fine-grained white sandstone, used for window and door-sills, and rough flags. Fossil remains of plants are abundant. The sandstone is about 20 to 30 feet thick. Beneath the Moor-side rock there are two beds of sandstone on the South of the river Wharfe ; they can be traced in the beds of the streams descending from the hills towards Addingham edge. It is on the Second Grit below the Ilkley Grit that Ben Rhydding is erected. On the North side of the river the lower beds of the Middle Grits extend from Nesfield to the top of Round Hill, thence by Bow Beck Gill, where they may be seen in the bed of the stream S.E. to Denton. In Denton Park they are thrown by the fault, already men tioned, which passes Ben Rhydding, against the Kinderscout Grit. There is also another expanse of this grit a couple of miles further Eastwards, extending to Scales in a S.E. direction beneath Askwith and * Geology of the Yorkshire Coalfields, p. 70."], [347, "GEOLOGY OF ILKLEY. XXI thence to Weston, where it is also brought by a fault running N. and S. into juxtaposition with the Kinder Grits which descend to the valley of the Wharfe. The line traced marks the outcrop of the lowest bed of the Middle Grits, from Nesfield the sandstone forms a rounded hill bounding the Wharfe valley as far as Ilkley Bridge, where it disappears. The sandstone is separated from the Kinder Grits of Langbar, Beamsley, and Denton Moors, by a thick bed of shale, and above it another bed of shale separates it from a second sandstone which extends in the form of a semi-circle from High Austby, Oliver, and Windover to Middleton : a nearly straight line extending from the upper part of Middleton Wood, past Middleton Lodge and Tivoli to High Austby, defines its Southern limit. The dip of the strata is from 8\u00b0 to 12 South. The ground rises rapidly from the bed of the river to the Northwards in undulating terraces, the sandstones forming rounded hills, but not escarpments, overlying the second sandstone there is a bed of shale, the highest stratum occurring North of the Wharfe. Near Low Marchup, S.W. from Addingham, on the road to Silsden, there is a bed of thin dark shales with nodules of earthy limestones, which contain numerous fossils of Goniatites, Avicula-pecten,Posidonomya, and others. A similar bed, which is probably equivalent to, and on the same horizon as, the one at Marchup ; it occurs in the bed of the stream which runs from Throstle Nest down to Silsden. Below this shale is a bed of grit with flaggy sandstone at its base about 40 feet thick, and below the grit 250 feet of shales separating the Middle from the Kinder scout Grits. Above the Ilkley Grit on Rombalds Moor there are two sandstones which form well-marked escarpments both above Ilkley and also East wards above Burley, on Silsden Moor. Between Spring Cragg Wood and Rivock Edge there are four beds of sandstone with intermediate shales, the latter not so thick as those separating the sandstones of the Middle Grits below the Ilkley Grit. The whole series is extremely variable, the sandstones thin out and dove-tail with beds of shale, and then, in a short distance, reappear again in a most perplexing manner. Further to the S.W. the Middle Grits coalesce into four distinct beds which for many miles are persistent. In the Aire valley, on the South side of Rombalds Moor, the Third Grits gradually disappear beneath the super incumbent Rough Rock of Hill Top and Gilstead Moor. In the railway cutting, near Guiseley,the upper Middle Grits are exposed. There are several patches of coal of small extent which have been worked in the Third Grit series, but they appear to thin out and disappear before reaching the valley of the Wharfe. The most impor tant is the Morton Banks Coal, which attains a thickness of 6 feet, and has been worked on the North side of the Aire, below Silsden Moor. It occurs beneath the Ilkley Grit. It has also been worked on both sides Elam Wood. There is also a bed of coal beneath the uppermost bed of the Middle Grits, which has been formerly extensively wrought by dayholes about Holden, on Silsden Moor."], [348, "XXII ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. ROUGH ROCK OR FIRST GRIT. The Rough Rock is generally a coarse, thick bedded grit, separated by a bed of shale of greater or less extent from the flagstones or Second Grit. In the area we have under consideration, however, these charac ters are a good deal modified, the Rough Rock of Rombalds Moor is divided into three beds with intermediate strata of shale, and the flag stone is not present until the South-eastern portion of the moor which overlooks Bingley and Shipley is reached. The lowest bed of sandstone crops out on Ilkley Moor in the escarpment at Cowper's Cross and Buckstones, on Whetstone Allotment. S.W. from this point the rock is thrown down to a lower level by faults running in a direction N.AV. to S.E., and forms a fine escarpment along Rivock Edge, overlooking the valley of the Aire. It continues to form a bold feature on the hill sides above Morton and Bingley. At Gilstead Moor, above Bingley, the Flagrock has put in an appearance, and it extends Eastwards under Baildon Moor, and often attaining a considerable thickness, is found beneath the Rough Rock in its further extension Eastwards. It is largely quarried, yielding roofing slates and flags of very good quality. From Cowper's Cross the outcrop of the Rough Rock extends Eastwards along Burley Moor. An occasional quarry may be found high on the moors, where the stone has been got for the erection of dry walls, or to build a farm house near its boundary. It is generally coarse in texture, composed of grains of quartz, and sometimes containing pebbles of chert or rolled crystals of felspar. The rock is easily disentegrated by the decomposition of the felspar, where the latter occurs in considerable quantity as a cementing material. Generally, however, it forms an extremely durable building stone, and resists the action of the smoky results of combustion of the manufacturing towns perfectly, appearing to become harder with exposure. The Grit Rock along its outcrop may not unfrequently be seen standing in weathered masses, forming huge monoliths rising many feet above the neighbouring surface of the rock, sometimes the base is undermined and the rock has become detached, perhaps forming a rocking stone. Examples of this kind may be seen at Spy Hill, near Weecher Flat, near the Southern termination of the moor where the path crosses from Ilkley to Shipley Glen. The middle bed of sandstone, separated from the lower one by a thin bed of shales, occurs at a higher level on Ilkley Moor, and extending in a S.E. direction forms the undulating surface ot Rombalds Moor to Hawksworth, Baildon and Gilstead. This great expanse of Grit Rock has a gradual dip towards the S.E., and decreases in elevation from about 1250 feet near N.W. outcrop to 800 on Hawksworth Moor, and 600 on Gilstead Moor. Separated by another thin bed of shale, the upper sandstone of the Rough Grit series forms the highest point on Rombalds Moor, 1323 feet above sea level, it forms only a small patch. N.W of Hawksworth there is a ridge of detached sandstone beds which"], [349, "GEOLOGY OF ILKLEY. XXIII are separated from the middle beds by layers of shale. These sandstones are quarried at Todda and Reva, and also crown the hill at Thimble Stones. It appears probable that these isolated beds of sandstone are the equivalents of the bed already mentioned, forming the summit of Rombalds Moor. In their course Southwards the three beds of Rough Rock appear to coalesce, or join together, and form one thick bed of sandstone which crops out beneath the coal strata of Baildon Common and around Gilstead Moor, opposite Bingley. It forms fine escarp ments along this line. South of Baildon Common the Rough Rock is faulted down towards Shipley, and is very extensively quarried in the vicinity of that place. The Rough Rock may be seen to advantage in Shipley Glen, a gorge cut through and separating the sandstones of Gilstead Moor and those beneath the coal measures of Baildon Common, and down which a stream descends from Spa Flat, on Rombald's Moor. Below the Rough Rock there is a bed of coal, which has been worked by means of bell pits, in the neighbourhood of Baildon. At the extreme S.E. corner of Rombalds Moor, between Bingley and Baildon, there is an outlier of the coal measures, separated from the lower coal measures of the Bradford district by the valley of the Aire. The outlier is in the form of a hill with rounded slopes, and protected by a bed of the Elland Flag Rock, or sixty yards Quarrel Rock, as it is locally termed ; on the North flank of the hill the ground is much broken by faults. Near Sconce Crag the Hard Bed Coal and the Rough Rock are thrown together. Two or three other faults have considerably dis placed the strata, they run more or less in E. and W. direction. South of the faults the beds succeed each other regularly with an average dip of 5\u00b0 to the S.E. The beds outcrop round the hill to the W., S. and E. The coal measures occuring on Baildon Moor are given in the following section : \u2014 SECTION OF THE LOWER COAL MEASURES AT BAILDON HILL, Sandstone on Surface \u2014 ft. in.

The hard and soft coals were formerly largely worked by means of a peculiarly shallow pit, extending at the bottom in the shape of a bell, and hence called \"Bell-pits.\" Many of these pits may be seen along the outcrop of each of the coal seams. The workings have been discon tinued, but the thick bed of underclay which is below the Hard Bed Coal is worked on the Western side of the hill, and is used for making chimney pots, tiles, and other articles. The Flag Rock, or sixty yards Quarrel, crops out all round the hill, and is quarried on its Southern side. A patch of the same bed of stone occurs at a lower level at Airehowe Hill, being thrown down by the E. and W. faults already mentioned Above the Quarrel Rock is a bed of shale surmounted by a thin sandstone, which forms the summit ofthe hill, 927 feet above sea level. GLACIAL DEPOSITS. The evidences of ice action exist abundantly throughout the district around Ilkley. It may be as well to describe the glaciated remains in the first place, and afterwards, as briefly as possible, to show the re- lationship they bear to the drift deposits in the neighbouring country, as well as to the general system of glaciation to which the whole of the North of England has been subjected. On Rombalds Moor, at Lanshaw Delves, there is a raised mound of considerable extent. It is composed of gravel, the stones being of local origin, and consisting principally of rounded pebbles of sandstone, with many examples of limestone and chert. The mounds rise between ten and fourteen feet from the level of the rock, and follow the ordinary dip of the strata. The surface of the mounds is in great part covered with short green grass, characteristic of limestone, and presents a decidedly different appearance to the surrounding heather-clad moors. The mounds have been extensively \" delved \" for the limestone pebbles they contain, and present a very uneven surface on that account. The old kilns, where the lime was burnt, still remain on the skirt of the mounds. The highest position occupied by the gravels is 1,175 feet above the sea level. They extend for a distance of about three-quarters of a mile West from Coldstone Beck, whilst on the Eastern side of the stream the mounds are continued in an E.S.E. direction to Hawks- worth; another mound branches off to Stock Gate. At Lanshaw Delves the mass of gravel is between 60 and 100 feet in width, and an average of this width is maintained for nearly half a mile, when the mound becomes wider, and is divided into two parallel parts, the intermediate portion having been removed by the stream. Beyond Coldstone Beck, the gravel mounds extend, more or less continuously, towards the valley of the Aire at Esholt, and gradually becoming spread out in the general expanse of morainic matter which occupies the whole of this part of the valley. The course of the mounds is indicated by the series of disused limekilns from Lanshaw Delves to Intake Dels, near Hawksworth."], [351, "GEOLOGY OF ILKLEY. XXV The ground in the district East of Baildon, at Tong Park, and up the hill side towards Hawksworth, is covered with moundy gravel. When the Railway was made from Shipley to join the Ilkley line at Guiseley, the following section was exposed at the Southern end of the tunnel West of Tong Park : \u2014 i. \u2014 Gravel and sand bedded in the upper part as though re-arranged by running water, this bed gradually passes, without any distinc- tion, into 2. \u2014 A mass of sand and gravel containing numbers of angular pieces of sandstone with an occasional patch of semi-stratified sand and rounded pebbles. The only difference between this bed and No. i is that it is more angular and does not exhibit the amount of arrangement into stratified beds which the part above does. 3. \u2014 A bed of stiff blue clay, containing angular blocks of sandstone and some black shale and a few pebbles of limestone, more or less marked by ice scratches; this bed rests on a much disturbed black shale. In this section the black shale presented the appearance of having been broken and ground up by a mass of moving ice ; the fractured shale was forced up into the blue till, and along with masses of angular sandstone derived from the rocks in the neighbourhood and smaller pieces of limestone which had been conveyed from a greater distance, were deposited altogether in the clay. There is a distinct line of de marcation between the blue clay and the gravel beds above, and the latter are probably the remains of the morainic matter left by the retiring glacier, after the till had been deposited, and there was an accession of a warmer climate. The character of the drift is maintained towards Tong Park Mill and Gill Beck, but beyond the latter the great preponderance of sandstone boulders and pebbles, as compared with limestone, is reversed, and the latter in large masses and frequently with ice-scratches in part obliterated become of very frequent occurrence. Near Lamb Springs the Lime stone Gravel rests on a very tenacious Blue Till, which still further Eastwards again gives place to a drift composed of stratified gravel. In the valley about Guiseley, and towards Otley, the tough blue till occurs in thick beds, covering nearly the whole surface of the ground. The underlying grit rocks, or shales, being but rarely exposed. From the valley these beds rise to a considerable height up the sides of the hills towards Hawksworth Moor, and are in turn overlaid by the gravel mounds already mentioned, descending from the Lanshaw Delves, &c, on Burley Moor. So that it appears probable that the gravels at these high levels bear the same relation to the Till as those at Tong Park, and represent a period when the glaciers were receding to the higher ground during some period when a warmer climate prevailed. On the Addingham Edge Grit, near the Hanging Rocks, above Ilkley, where the surface has been newly uncovered for quarrying purposes, there have been, from time to time, exposures of glacial groovings ; the"], [352, "XXVI ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. surface of the rock having a peculiarly smooth appearance, with numerous scratches running in a parallel direction to the line of the valley. These observations afford an increased testimony that glaciers have passed over Rombalds Moor at the height of 1,100 to 1,200 feet, and have left evidence of their presence and eventual retreat in the masses of morainic matter composing the gravel mounds. Besides the gravel mounds from Lanshaw Delves, and their exten sion to the S.E., to the valley below, there are similar mounds on the opposite side of the river Wharfe, at Askwith, and other places ; the streams descending from the hills generally exposing a considerable thickness of Till or Gravel. The ground N.E. from Ilkley is nearly all covered with Till, containing stones, mainly derived from the rocks in the immediate vicinity, with a smaller number of limestone pebbles. On the Southern side of the valley of the Wharfe, Till is also abun dant, extending in patches along the hill side beneath the Gritstone Cliffs towards Addingham. Several of the stream courses are cut through the Till, exposing sections of bluish grey clays, containing imbedded sub-angular boulders of sandstone, and masses of well rounded limestone, well scratched, and up to 10 or 12 inches in diameter; some of the lime stone boulders are encrinital, and there are frequently boulders of chert. On Rombalds Moor, South of Ilkley, the stream which rises on the Whetstone Allotments, and flowing S.E., called the Morton Beck, cuts through a bed of Till nearly one hundred feet thick, which contains numerous scratched stones of local origin, mainly sandstones and lime stone. On the moor at this part, called Bingley Moor,* \" at an elevation of 750 feet, a stiff tenacious clay of a bluish colour, and containing boulders of sandstone with occasional lenticular patches of sand and gravel, was exposed in making a reservoir in connection with the Shipley Waterworks.\" The plateau of grit rock of Addingham Moor side is covered in some places with deposits of Till and gravel, and in the valley, on the opposite side, towards Silsden, there are extensive beds of Till These are exposed in sections cut by the stream which runs through Silsden. North of the village, towards Cringles and Marchup, there are several very good sections. It is a bluish, or dark grey clay, very dense and tenacious, containing a large number of sub-angular or rounded stones of sandstone, hard shale, chert, ironstone and limestone. As with other similar deposits in the neighbourhood, the contained boulders are all of local origin, and have been derived from the rocks in the immediate neighbourhood. They have rarely travelled more than a few miles. It is worthy of observation that the thickest deposits of Drift or Till are always found occupying the hollows of stream courses, whilst the inter mediate ground between the streams is often comparatively bare of drift Take for example the Silsden or Morton Becks, where great thicknesses occur, amounting in the latter to a total depth of a hundred feet, whilst the higher ground of Silsden Moor is almost free * West Yorkshire, p. 207."], [353, "GEOLOGY OF ILKLEY. XXVII from Till. This proves that all the stream courses so filled were pre-glacial, and that the system of drainage before the glacial period was, in all essential respects, similar, and followed the same channels as that which at present exists. There can be no doubt, however, that the channels may have been affected by the passage of the ice, either down the main watercourses, like that of the Wharfe, or across the course of the smaller streams which ran into the Wharfe on either side. The form of the ground became rounded, the angular outcrops of the beds of sandstone were ground down and smoothened off, hollows filled in with drift of one kind or another, and the whole country assumed a more or less rounded hillocky form. Much of this appearance is still preserved, as for example along the North bank of the Wharfe, where the whole surface is thickly spread with mounds of glacial matter to so large an extent that it is only in rare instances that the underlying rocks of the Millstone Series can be seen. Since the retrocession of the glaciers the country has been again subject to the ordinary action of rain and other sub\u00e6rial agencies. The streams have generally followed the same courses that they did before, and have to some extent re-carved their channels in the glaciated matter which had filled them up, after probably being much enlarged by the grinding action of the ice. As already observed, the drift in the valley of the Wharfe and its vicinity, contains only stones derived from the grit and limestone rocks in the vicinity. In the valley of the Aire, a little further North, there are, besides local rocks, large numbers of granites and other boulders carried from long distances by the ice and left where they are now found. It is probable that the latter were brought during a period in the earlier part of the glacial epoch. The great glaciers, which descending from Scotland and the lake district, overspread many of the highest mountains in Yorkshire, and filled up the valleys hundreds of feet thick with ice, do not appear to have left any trace of their presence in the district we are considering. It appears very reasonable to infer that the Wharfe glacier as well as others, were of local extent, and that only under rare circumstances did they succeed in passing out of one water shed into another. It would follow that their occurrence was during a period of less intense cold than that of the great ice sheet of the earlier period. The Till, with enclosed sub-angular and scratched stones, is the product of this period. The boulder beds and gravels were probably aggregated during a later and warmer period, when the glaciers were gradually retreating further and further up the valleys, and left great masses of boulders along their track which accumulated in beds above the glacial clays. Occasionally these upper beds may have been subjected to the action of water, and have become re-arranged, and to some extent stratified or bedded. RIVER GRAVELS, In the valley of the Wharfe there are two well-defined terraces of Alluvium. The most modern, which is in process of formation at the"], [354, "XXVIII ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. present time, consists of extensive flats of sand and gravel, only a few feet above the bed of the river. The second is composed of gravel and sand, also forming terraces of considerably larger superficial area at an elevation of about 25 feet above the modern beds. The older or higher river terraces are composed in the lower part of clay, generally loose and sandy, and of a very different texture from the Boulder Clay or Till, previously described. The river clays are replete with smooth rounded pebbles of sandstone, chert and limestone. Higher, and usually forming the surface of the terraces, they are com- posed of gravel and sand, the gravel consisting, as in the clays, of rounded pebbles of limestone, sandstone, &c. The lower portion of the town of Ilkley is built on one of the higher river terraces, which stretches from thence Westwards, to a point where the road to Adding- ham comes into close proximity with the Wharfe, whilst in the opposite direction the terrace is continued a short distance beyond Ben Rhydding Station. Sections may be examined between the road and the river bed in its vicinity .At Ilkley, the lower bed of clay, with sub-angular stones, rest on the shales of the Millstone Grit Measures, and above the clay forming the surface of the ground are beds of gravel. On the opposite side of the river to Ben Rhydding there is a wide extent of the Higher Alluvium under a great part of Denton Park, and extending thence down the valley past Burley, which is erected on it, and to Otley, also situated on the higher river terrace level. A good section of the beds is exposed on the side of the Wharfe, opposite The Crook, near Denton Park. Resting on the shale, forming the present level of the river, there are about 20 feet of clay and stones, the limestone pebbles are smooth and well rounded, whilst many of those of sandstone are sub-angular in form. The latter, being in great measure, derived from the rocks in near proximity to their present position, have not been so much rolled as the limestones which have been carried from a longer distance. The higher portion of the terrace is made up of gravel and sand of a rougher and coarser kind than the lower beds. Similar sections may be noted along the course of the terrace towards Otley. The older river terraces formed at one time the bed of the river, when it ran at a higher level than it does at present. They extended from one side, across the valley, to the other, and there can be no doubt from their composition and mode of occurrence that they were accumu- lated in the old river channel in exactly the same way that the modern or lower level terraces are forming at the present time. In process of time the river cut down through its old bed to a lower level, and during this operation removed large portions of the material forming the terrace. The ever changing course of the stream widened and deepened the channel until it has again reached its earliest bed of carboniferous shale or sandstone. Since then the lower or recent terraces have been, and are being formed every tinfe the river is subject to a \" freshet \" and overflows its banks, leaving a layer of mud or sand over the flat lands bordering the stream."], [355, "II. $otan\\> of tbe 3lfcle\\> District, BV F. ARNOLD LEES, F.L.S"], [356, ""], [357, "Botang of tbe fifties District. HE Botany of the \"Ilkley district,\" by which I restrict myself to Wharfedale, between Pool and Addingham, the Washburn and Menston valleys, the Esholt and Burley woods, and the moorlands from Leathley, and Otley Chevin, to Addingham and Beamsley, does not offer to the mere collector of rarities for the herbarium any such surpassing inducements as those of the Barden and Bolton, or the \" Craven \" hill regions. There is a suffi- cient diversity in level, truly; but too great a sameness in the character of the soil, with its underlying rock, to afford any very great variety in the types of the plant-forms clothing the surface. Nevertheless, to the student of phyto-geography, who must take his experience in distinct instalments, inquiring into the How and the Why the flowers he gathers in any tract have come to be where he finds them, this district of Ilkley is as interesting and instructive as it could well be. For he will soon find that all the plants, whether the higher \" flowering,\" or the lower \" flowerless \" ones belong to one class \u2014 as to their requirements for successful life, that is : when, having gained a correct, general idea of the character of the flora about Ilkley, he may profitably pass on to a tract the lithological conditions of which are dissimilar, and initiating a like inquiry into the existing species upon different material (i.e., rock and soil), he could then both correct and crystallize thi accumulated isolated data into clear knowledge of the causes, now and ever at work, which influence the distribution of such humble and (apparently) accidentally-placed things as wild flowers and weeds. Within the limit of space allotted to me, I can only indicate \u2014 as suggestively as may be \u2014 the general lines such an inquiry as this has to take. First of all we must ask : were the plants we now find clothing the surface always there ? Manifestly not, for by the light geological history gives us, no one can well deny that the whole of this Ilkley district was buried for \u00e6ons under the frozen sea of the glacial epoch, during which time vegetable life was an impossibility. Whence and How, then, came the vegetation that gradually crept over the surface when, EE."], [358, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. XXXII the climate becoming milder, the land rose slowly above the melting ice ? The reply is only more a matter of surmise than of certainty, as regards the particular region from which the rocks and moors were first re-stocked. Most probably it was through the agency of the North \u25a0wind, conveying the seeds or spores of plants from the unsubmerged peaks of Scotland, on which \u2014 if we may assume any analogy between them and the Greenland summits of to-day, on which, in spite of sur rounding glaciers, some 500 phanerogams, mosses, and lichens exist \u2014 in all probability, throughout the Ice Age, some meagre flora onlingered. The only conceivable alternative is, that seeds or spores of species present on the moorlands before the glacial period, lay dormant for centuries in the soil ; and, germinating as the mean temperature rose above 34\u00b0 Fahr., originated the primal verdure. We may see a somewhat similar process of appropriation going on to-day on new made railway banks, and ground recently drained or broken up, and allowed to lie fallow for a few seasons ; the only essential difference being that the earlier crops of plants consist of weeds that in point of age are the newer instead of the older constituents of our British flora. These first settlers are not permanent, however, but in course of time are shouldered out by others of older and more stable type, with stronger powers of appropriation. We must not overlook the fact that plants vary in their constitution, for in the vegetable, no less than in the animal world, a battle for supremacy and possessions ever going on; and whilst some are strong and aggressive, successfully multiplying wherever they once get root-hold, others are essentially weak (not necessarily tender, for they may be hardy in the sense of enduring cold) and unable to spread where competition is vigorous. Let the genesis of the Ilkley flora in its earlier stages, however, be due to dormant seeds or adventitious winds, at a later period the gradual dispersion of species must have been brought about in two other great ways \u2014 the action of water, streams conveying roots and seeds from high levels to lower, and the unintentional influence of living things, man, and the lower animals. Colonizing nations, and invading tribes of men, have, since Norsemen and Romans over-ran our land, been a prolific source cf vegetable in troductions not seldom long outlasting the media of their acclimatiza tion. Commerce and agriculture have added almost annual reinforce ments, ever since the Flemings brought fleeces of wool to England. It has been shown that migratory birds can carry seeds in their \" crops \" over half a continent, which seeds, voided with their excreta, have germinated. The plants of the common gooseberry, so often met with singly in the hedgerows, to say nothing of the \" wild \" cherry trees of our groves, have most probably in part originated by such means. It is not necessary to point out the species which the Romans or the Monks brought to this valley in particular, when the sole purpose of these statements is to hint merely at indirect means by which the early Ilkley flora may have been enriched ; but it is none the less true that the age of the component parts of the Ilkley flora varies so"], [359, "BOTANY OF ILKLEY. XXXIII vastly, that out of the 800 to 900 species to be presently enumerated, not above half can be said to be truly aboriginal, whilst the rest (leaving out of count some 50 plants veritably parvenus, such as the Poppies, Veronicas, and other weeds of arable land,) but represent the successions of invaders that have gradually ousted the original occupants of the soil, and, aided by drainage and aggressive agriculture, have relegated them more and more exclusively to the steeper slopes and impracticable boggy moorlands. Even on the peaty mosses and heathery crags, several species, fairly plentiful within the memory of living botanists (such as Lycopodium and Nartheciuni), are known to be gradually dying out. I have thus far purposely followed out one of the side issues of the inquiry into the reasons for the restrictions of species to certain stations, to show how sometimes the answers may be found at the ve:ry outset in altered conditions of civilization ; but with regard to the real aboriginals of the flora, Why they only, and not others also, should occur on unaltered ground, such as the grit edges and turfy swamps of the moor, the solution is not so easily arrived at. All one can add is, that apart from their constitutions, plants have preferences born of needs, which must be complied with before they can flourish, be the competition ever so meagre. If the conditions are unfit, the spore of (let us say) a limestone-loving fern, wind-borne from a Craven Scar, to be dropt in a niche of gritstone on Rombalds Moor, falls on stony ground, and, if it germinates at all, quickly perishes. These needs of plants are, indeed, connected primarily with the average moisture, and physical, not chemical, condition of the soil ; but with these the underlying rock has not a little to do. It is easy to understand why the connection between the flora of any district and the strata must naturally be very intimate, when it is the detritus from those strata which mainly goes to make up the soil \u2014 the matrix for plant growth, and source of most of the nutriment needed by the vegetable organism. More than a quarter of a century ago, Thurmann, on the Continent, and J. G. Baker, in England, discriminated and defined two great types of rock, well contrasted in their structure, and differing greatly in their behaviour under the disintegrating processes effected by water and weather. These types were termed by Thurmann the eu-geogenous, and the dys-geogenous ; appropriate, if hard names, but expressive of those litho-logical characters which it is most important to bear in mind, as a translation of them into English shows, viz., the true earth-bearing, or plentiful detritus-yielding, and the difficult earth-bearing, or, in freer words, yielding soil sparingly. All the Yorkshire rock beds belong to one or other of these types ; and those throughout the whole of the Ilkley district, exclusively flagstones and Millstone Grits of Carboni ferous Age, come most unmistakably under the eu-geogenous category. This identity in rock character eventuates in a practical similarity of soil, and gives the flora that sameness which is distinctive of the type. The Ilkley grit-rock is hard as to its silicious particles, but these are"], [360, "XXXIV ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. bound together in a matrix easily abraded by water and weather, thus yielding detritus in plenty ; whilst the shaly and clayey beds interposing here and there between the harder layers, hold moisture within and retain it above them. The soils overlying these beds are comparatively heavy, cold, and wet, and less fertile than those over the other type of rock. The dys-geogenous stratum, being unrepresented in our area, must be dismissed with the briefest indication of the contrast it affords the botanical geographer. The mountain limestone of Craven is a typical example : the rock, hard, homogeneous, yielding detritus sparingly, yet so fissured that water runs off and through it readily \u2014 the soil above, although scanty, comparatively fertile, because at once warmer, drier, and richer in proportion to its bulk in vegetable humus. Being so permeable to water, there is an almost complete absence of the peat mosses that so extensively fill the depressions of the gritstone tracts resting on water-logged sandy detritus. The effect exerted upon the configuration of the land \u2014 the scenery, in the different methods of \" weathering \" exhibited by the two types of rock, is no less striking than that upon the flora. The eu-geogenous gritstone hill-ranges stretch for miles in irregular series of gentle curves and swells, the gently in clined slopes of the shallow open dales unequally broken at intervals by protruding terraces of low crags or scattered boulders, and pierced here and there by lesser valleys and ghylls, down the tree-like ramifi cations of which rills, originating in the boggy levels, flow gradually to the main valleys with few or no cascades in their course. In the limestone-hill tracts, we see the very opposite of all this. The green turfed, rarely boggy plateaux, end in sheer mural scars, and the dales are narrow and deep, hemmed in by abrupt slopes, the gills breaking which are unforked chasms with wall-like sides, ending in culs-de-sac, often step-like, as in the ancient amphitheatre, in the arrangement of the layers of the limestone rock. The streamlets of the ghylls either form a succession of cascades over the rims of the plates of strata, or per meate through the fissures from the higher levels, to gush out under the limestone where it reaches a less porous stratum in the ghyll bed. The indigenous plants prevailing over these two types of rock are equally distinctive. The least skilled observer traversing the moor or moor slopes of this Ilkley area from end to end, would find a considerable number of species to recur constantly ; and, from their abundance as individuals, no less than from their frequency, they form the most prominent feature of the vegetation. These prevailing plants of eu geogenous rock areas constitute a psammophilous (sand-loving) class, as distinguished from the xerophilous (dry-loving) class, the preferences of which are for soils above dys-geogenous strata. There are two sub divisions of this sand-loving class : those at home preferentially upon wet, sandy, or boggy soils, such being termed hydrophilous ; and those adapted for flourishing under drier conditions, although still affecting silicious, not calcareous soils \u2014 these being the true arenophiles. Both sub-classes have representatives in the Ilkley district, but the true dry"], [361, "BOTANY OF ILKLEY. XXXV sand-lovers are comparatively few in number, restricted in great part to bare ground about the flag and gritstone quarries of Otley and Mens ton, and the better drained, sandier fields adjacent to the river. To learn which are the hygrophilous species typical of an eu-geoge nous hill, we have only to walk from Ilkley Station, or thereabout, in a diagonal line, up the ascent to the craggy rim of the moor, and thence to the highest point of Rombald's Moor, only some 1,300 feet above sea level. We rise about 700 feet in the mile and three-quarters be tween Ilkley Bridge and the escarpment, and barely 300 feet more in the long mile further to the summit. We may attain this by two routes : either by Parish Gill and the Keighley bridle path, turning to the left at Cowper's Cross ; or, ascending by the Cow and Calf rocks, follow to its head the main rill in the ghyll immediately to the East, and across the boggy swells until the circle of stones on Langshaw has been reached, when we must turn abruptly to the right. One way may be tried in going, the other in returning ; but whilst keeping the right general direction, the beaten path must be left, and the rill-banks in the gills followed from low down up to their heads, and thence to the sum mit, the mosses and peaty pool-sides must be explored, if a full survey of the flora is to be made. So typical is the flora of the route sketched, that Mr. Baker, in his scarce work, treating of \" North Yorkshire,\" chose to give a detailed account of it, in preference to any spot within the strict limits of his book ; and we have, likewise, only to jot down the names of the preponderating species, to be in possession of a list which, with unimportant modifications, would hold good for the whole of the Northern half of England, and the Scottish lowlands. I have arranged them as follows, in groups, substantially in the order in which they would be met with in the ascent : \u2014 (1) the plants of the lower grassy slopes, and swampy pastures ; (2) the plants of the ghylls, their bushy and furzy banks low down, and higher up their rill-side swamps and dripping banks ; (3) the stonier upper part of the slope about the boulders and craggy terraces ; (4) the plants of the open moorland, its heathery banks and its peaty depressions ; and (5) the vegetation of the stony summit-ridges.

Some of the species named in the foregoing list might have been included in more of the groups : in nature, it must be remembered, no hard and fast limit exists, and the grouping (made for convenience), although substantially the result of actual observation on the spot on various occasions, makes no pretension to be both absolutely exhaustive and exact. There are a dozen or two other, rarer species besides those mentioned (such as Lysimachia nemorum among the Bracken, or Auagallis tenella in the mossy swamps), occurring casually in a few places, which, anyone attempting to verify the list might well stumble upon, whilst failing to observe some few of those enumerated. Before proceeding to give a systematic list of the Ilkley flora, one other factor in the problem of distribution remains to be mentioned. This is the presence of a river, of considerable volume when in flood, running through the district from lands with florulas of montane and xerophilous type. In the course of ages, the land for some little dis tance on either side of the present river-bed, has become overlaid with river drift, in which is a certain admixture of calcareous particles. The same agency has enriched the vegetation of the valley bottom to a small extent. Upon the banks of the main stream, as far as the foot of the river terraces, a score or more species of plants occur, found nowhere else in the Ilkley district, and not seldom even more luxuriant in size than in their real home, \u2014 telling to us the story of how winter-torrents, or thunder-storm spates, dislodged roots or flushed seeds from their normal localities up among the hills; and, washing them down, de posited them in the back-washed mud of the river creeks, or hedge banks at flood height, where they could flourish on drift, overlying a stratum the detritus of which alone would not suffice for their needs. Examples of this element in the flora are \u2014 Trollius Europ\u00e6us, Cochlearia officinalis, Hesperis matronalis, Geranium sylvaticum, Poterium Sanguisorba, Ribes rubrum, Myrrhis odorata, Plantago media, Allium oleraceum, but others will be alluded to in their place as reached in the systematic enumeration appended hereto.

DENISON ROEBUCK, F.L.S., The Secretaries of the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union, and Joint- Authors of \" Handbook of the Vertebrate Fauna of Yorkshire \" ; AND JOHN W. TAYLOR, Editor of \" Tlie fournal of Conchology.\""], [389, "ssauna 0f tbe metgbbourboob of 3lfeles HE district to which the following notes apply may be briefly described as that portion of Wharfedale extending N. W. to Barden Bridge, and S. E. to Otley Bridge, together with the moorlands situate within the drainage area of the Wharfe, the whole being within easy walking distance from Ilkley as a centre. Physically, the aspect of the district is striking and characteristic, and it may be defined as a deep and comparatively narrow river-valley, flanked by steep and well-wooded hill-slopes, which are crowned by extensive stretches of heathery moor- land. Speaking entirely from a zoologist's point of view, the geology of the district may be considered as practically of homogeneous structure, the hill-slopes and summits being entirely millstone grit, while the bottom of the valley is occupied by glacial drift of calcareous origin. The list of vertebrated animals may be regarded as approximately complete, the only additions which may be expected being the migratory species, and a few of the rare casual visitants among the birds, and in the case ofthe mammals, the results of a critical examination of the smaller and more obscure species.

The Birds offer an interesting combination of the species of an ordinary rural well-wooded and watered district, with those of an elevated or sub-alpine and moorland region ; those of the latter class affording the only special features possessed by the ornithology of the district The list given contains 108 species, of which 53 are Residents, 28 Summer Visitants, and 12 Winter Visitants. These three groups, taken together, present us with the species (93 in number) which are regular inhabitants of the district, whilst the Residents and Summer Visitants (81 in number) indicate the species which breed annually. The remaining 15 birds are but Casual Visitants, the appearance of some few of which is partially dependent upon the severity of the winters, whilst the occurrence of the others must be considered purely casual, or to be looked for only during the season of migration in the Spring or Autumn, when no doubt many \" waders \" traverse the district. To these numbers might be added several species of Gulls and Terns, but as they are usually only seen flying at a considerable elevation it is impossible to venture a reliable opinion upon their species.

LXIX REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS.\u2014 By Wm. Denison Roebuck, F.L.S. The list of animals of these classes includes all the species which may reasonably be expected to occur in a Northern district, with the exception of the Great Warty Newt, a species which, however, most probably, will be found when looked for. Common Snake. Has been noticed both at Bolton and at Ilkley, but is very local and decidedly rare. Viper. Abundant on all the moors, and in Bolton Woods. Viviparous Lizard. Common on the moors.

FISHES.\u2014 By Wm. Eagle Clarke, F.L.S. The character of the Fish-fauna is the direct result of the physical nature of the district, the Wharfe being here too swift a stream to permit of the presence, in any numbers, of the various species of \" coarse fish,\" which abound in its lower and stiller reaches, whilst several species do not occur at all within the district. Three-spined Stickleback. Not uncommon in ponds. Barbel. Not numerous, occurs as far up the stream as Addingham. Chub. Not numerous, occurs in the river as far as Addingham. Dace. Is not reported as occurring above Ilkley. Minnow. Extremely abundant in the river. Loach. Abundant in the shallows of the river. River Trout. The characteristic fish of the district, being abundant in the Wharfe and the moorland tributary streams. Salmon.

Abundant in the Wharfe. Lampern. Not uncommon in the Wharfe. LAND AND FRESH- WATER MOLLUSCA. By John W. Taylor. The character of the Mollusca found is affected by the physical geography of the valley. This being a comparatively narrow and steep sided groove, down which runs a rapidly-flowing river, and there being no ponds or ditches of any importance, water shells are very few in number and not common, the following species being all that have been noted : \u2014 Pisidium amnicum MiilL Found in the river near Burley and Otley."], [396, "LXX ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN.

The land shells and slugs are more numerous in species ; they are, however, more abundant by the river banks than elsewhere, no doubt on account of the calcareous nature of the glacial drift which occupies the lowest levels of the valley, a limestone soil being more favourable than any other to the existence of mollusca. The district being, in its upper part, an elevated one, yields some species of a Northern or rather sub-Alpine character, such as Balia perversa, which is, however, not so fine as it is nearer the mountains, Helix rupestris and Clausilia dubia.

OMBALDS, Rumbles, Rumles, or Romelies' Moor, for in these and some other ways the word has been written, is the name given to the moun- tainous range, reaching from Menston and Guiseley to Bingley and Silsden. It consists of the vast moors of Burley, Hawksworth, Ilkley, Morton, Addingham, Bingley, Silsden, with the lesser moors, Gilstead, &c. To these may be added, as once forming a part, Skipton and Baildon Moors. On this high range we meet with names of British origin, and one would expect to find that Rombalds (like Pennine, Chevin, Billing, Aire, Wharfe, Llecan,) was British. Although Romelies were great lords at Bolton and Skipton ; and Rombald was a great saint at Rombaldkirk, and other places ; and Rombald ought to have been, to satisfy modern ideas, a vast giant reigning on this mountain ; we look for some more ancient rumbling source than any of these. Maude's Verbeia gives a pretty fancy that it is so named from a Roman Consul at Olicana named Romelius, but even this antiquity does not satisfy the writer hereof, who clings to the idea that the name was known and used here ere Romelius founded Rome. This now treeless, houseless, uncultivated region has been, more or less, a dense forest ; the oak, elm, and birch, have flourished near the top of the mountain, proved not only by the remains of bog-oak, &c, but by the equally significant terms, Shaw, &c, by which parts of the upland districts are known. Several ancient well paved trackways tell of a time in remote days, when these hills were more constantly traversed than even now, and other remains show that long permanent settlements have been made here by tribes that had passed away before Brigantia had its chronicler. The similarity of the name Baildon, though by some considered too-far-fetched, to the Hill of Baal, the Sun, led to searching for remains in that district first, and Mr. Colls' letter, 1843, to Edward Hailstone, Esq., F.S.A, printed in the Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. xxxi, was about the earliest attempt in describing these remains. The Ordnance Maps have greatly assisted in the enquiry. Mr. Colls records the results in opening two gravemounds. Mr."], [404, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. LXXVIII Wardell, of Leeds, wrote an account of the \" finds,\" in Bowman's Reliqui\u00e6, 1855, from which we gather that a rude circular urn, twelve inches in diameter, and nine or ten inches deep (Fig. 1), containing calcined bones, ashes, and charcoal, indicating the cre mation of a youth, was found in an upright position, two feet below the surface of the ground, near the centre of a circle of earth and stones, about fifty feet in diameter. The upper part of the urn is ornamented with incised lines crossing each other. FIG. I. Near the road from Baildon to Bingley, on the highest part of the Eastern moor, overlooking Sconce, is a peculiar entrenchment on the South and East of a similar circle to the one just described. The circle was about fifty feet in diameter ; the entrench ment still remains, and is thirty-six feet long on the South, and eighty on the West side, and consists of a fosse with an agger on each side. Within the circle, which had been previously dis turbed, ashes, burnt bones, charcoal, and a broken urn (Fig. 2.) were found At a short distance from these remains, two feet below the surface, a broken urn, in an inverted"], [405, "BRITISH OR PREHISTORIC REMAINS. LXXIX position was found (Fig. jj, which, when complete, was about seven inches in diameter. Amongst the bones and ashes near it was a flint arrow-head of the same size as the annexed woodcut. Leaving Mr. Hail stone's discoveries, Mr. Wardell records the dis covery, by two casual visitors, of the fragments of a red earthenware urn, in a cairn almost level with the surrounding ground, about a foot below the surface. Calcined bones, as before, accompanied the urn, which had been about four inches in diameter at the top. Mr. Wardell possessed this urn. After recording the universal superstition that pre vai 1 s respecting the frequent thunderstorms, sent by the \" divell \" or some other wrathful agency, that overtake plunderers of graves, andinstancing some well-attested cases, especially a fearful storm, when the last described urn was found on Baildon, Mr. Wardell calls atten tion to some singular lookingpits, of consider able width at the top, but gradually narrowing to a point at the bottom, similar to an inverted cone, their average depth being about ten feet. These he supposed to be pit-dwellings of the priests, who officiated on Baal's High Plain. They have generally a North-eastern aspect. On the Ordnance Maps they are designated \"old coal pits,\" but from their number, contiguity, and situation, he concluded they could not be. Mr. Wardell's vivid imagination lines these pits with brackens and grass, and the skins of animals ; he erects a cosy roof of branches, ling and grass ; kindles a fire at the bottom ; sees the blue smoke curling above the roof ; treads softly after a long procession headed by the High Priest ; sees the immolation of a helpless captive as the grand old Sun peeps above the horizon ; around the sacred enclosure a vast concourse sink upon their knees as the victim's palpitating heart is heid aloft for an offering, and finally, with the carcase, burned and buried near. \" This is no imaginary sketch,\" we are told, yet we venture to think that it is based much on imagination.

Glossop in the Bradford Antiquary, 1882. These are Robin Hood's Chair in French Wood, near Saltaire, which seems to be a naturally formed seat in the rock ; two cup-marked rocks, a short distance from the gate leading from Saltaire to Eldwick Glen, one having a long incised line pointing Eastwards ; a prominent eartinoork circle, of nearly fifty yards diameter, known as the Soldiers' Trench, having a double row, a yard wide, of large boulder stones set edgeways, and fairly perfect towards the West, between which the stones and rubble shew indications of intense fires ; two other cup-marked rocks ; clusters of pits at Crook's Gate and other places ; solid lines of causeway, deeply worn ; iron-stone roadway ; and, possibly, despoiled rocking stone and cromlech. A lithographic sketch accompanies Mr. Glossop's paper. If these pits are old coal-workings, then colliers in olden times were exceedingly dainty and particular, finishing off each pit and surrounding embankment with as much care as a gravemaker, or landscape gardener. He reaches the coal, probably, and then carefully leaves off. A coal-getter would have trenched straight before him, and thrown the refuse anywhere rather than with such regularity.

LXXXII length With brambles added, they may have been used for securing cattle. Over Greenhill Crag, we reach Lanshaw Delves, (so called from a long wood that evidently existed here in ancient times, though there may be a British element in Llan.) Here, at noo feet height, are double, and even triple rows of pit-dwellings, half-a-mile in length, by forty yards broad at the East end. They are ten or more feet in diameter, five feet deep in the centre, and surrounded in each case by an elevated mound or rim. Two or three are sometimes enclosed by one rim. Larger pits sometimes occur at one end, as in this case. [Similar pits in Bradley Wood, near Brighouse, have been pronounced charcoal pits.] In front of the rows are twelve hillocks, about ten feet in diameter, each with an opening towards the South-East, shewing traces of a fierce fire. These were supposed to be the bake-houses, or common ovens, but, after investigation, Mr. Jonathan Hainsworth pronounced them lime-kilns. The vegetation of this dry, sandy ridge, with wood sorrell, wild strawberry, germander, speedwell, nettle, and a solitary white-thorn, differs greatly from that of the surrounding moor. An old boundary, or mere stone, near is known as the Lanshaw Lass. A quarter of a mile North of the Grubstone Shooting Box or Tower, that \u2022 conspicuous object, 15ft. square, 30ft high, beckoning the denizens of Bradford to a bracing walk over the moor, is another group of pits with one fire mound, and two or three small mounds or barrows, eight feet by four, and two feet high. Lanshaw Dam, a modernly constructed reservoir, storing the water of the swamps for a mill at Burley, lies between the Tower and these pits. A short distance Eastwards, we reach a cairn called The Little Skirtful of Stones, about sixty yards in circum ference, seven feet high, and hollow in the centre. The stones vary in weight from a pound to a hundredweight. The common story is, that giant Rumbald and his wife, residents on the moor, having quarrelled, the giantess collected her skirtful of stones with which to pelt him, when her skirt strings broke, leaving this monument. His Satanic Majesty is also credited with the huge pile, and, being chased, leaped across the valley, some ten miles, alighting on Almias Cliff Cragg, where his foot mark is still visible. These traditions sufficiently indicate a high antiquity for these remains, and remind us of similar stories in all parts of the Northern countries. Everything remarkable is attributed to Satanic agency, or to Robin Hood. A noted chieftain or priest is said to have been buried under this pile. About 120 yards Eastwards is another group of pits on a knoll, with two fire mounds. The promin ence near is named Woofa Bank, and Ulfa has been substituted for Rombald, but there are other Woofa Banks in the district, so Woofa and Todda may mean wolf and fox hows. Coldstone Beck drains the ravine, crossing which we reach another series of pits adjoining a second dam. East of the Tower, quarter of a mile, is the large cairn \u2014 The Great Skirtful of Stones, consisting of more than a hundred tons, and large quantities have been removed for road-mending. It is about 90 yards in circumference, and in the hollowed centre is a large boundary stone, in-"], [409, "BRITISH OR PREHISTORIC REMAINS. LX3XXIII. scribed, \" Walter Hawksworth. This is Rumbles Law.\" (Law means hill). Eighty yards East, there is a complete circle, with agger and trench, twenty-seven yards in diameter; the agger six feet across, three feet high, with a central cavity of two yards diameter. This has been supposed to be a relic of Baal worship. Near the adjoining old trackway, which runs from East to West, will be seen a small barrow, and a double series of pit dwellings, with a large pit at the East end. Another boundary stone, bearing the words, \"Walter Hawksworth, Thomas Pulleyn,\" is near, and a quarter of a mile East of it, on Craven Hill, is another group of pits. On Long Ridging Hill is another group with fire pits, named on the Ordnance Maps, Limestone Boulder Pits. [Passing through a hunting gate from Hawksworth Moor to Gaping Goose, we find another long series of pits.] South-East of the Shooting Tower is a circle of twenty-seven yards diameter, with large stones set edgeways, supposed to have been a Council or Moot Assembly-place. Nearly a mile Westward, close to the great foot path from Baildon and Eldwick, is another circle, sixteen yards in diameter, composed of twelve upright stones, three or four feet high. This has been named as a Druidical Dial Circle, indicating the hours or the seasons. Lanshaw Lad is the name of a boundary stone near. [At Horncliff is a gamekeeper's house, where John Nicholson, the Airedale Poet, was a pupil under Briggs, a besom-maker. Near the house is another circle, similar to the last-named] Retreating with the two Ramblers over rushy swamps, dry heather, and rocky moor, we reach the crest of Ilkley Hill, and a never-to-be-forgotten picture, one of the grandest panoramas that eye can behold, bursts upon us. Wharfedale spreads herself gloriously. Ilkley lies nestled below, and the White House, perched upon a landslip, is at our feet. The pedestrian flings himself on the soft earth, and ravishes in the prospect. The Ramblers issued a second part, twenty pages, in 1868, giving a short sketch of Addingham and the 1826 mill-riot Counterhill, referred to by Dr. Whitaker as a Roman out-post, is now described as British work. They found three barrows, a camp called Round Dykes, a trench, and a vallum, which enclosed the upper part of the hill. One barrow is forty yards, the other sixty in circuit, and about five feet high. They had both been explored. The third burial mound is bowl-shaped, nine feet in diameter, with trench and vallum, making a total diameter of twenty- four yards. Round Dykes is oval-shaped, the longer axis being 300 feet, the shorter 250; the trench outside the vallum is fifteen feet wide, and four feet deep. Half-a-mile Southwards is another, 440 feet by 275, with a slight surrounding ditch, now under cultivation, but said by Dr. Whitaker to have contained previously a great number of rude fireplaces. Near Parson's Lane is another bowl-shaped barrow, eighteen feet in diameter, four feet high, which has been disturbed. Near Moorcock Hall is a group of pit dwellings, 70 yards by 40, but no fire places. A small barrow is near. On Woofa Bank (a second Woofa), near Cowbum-beck is a group of pits 1750 feet by 400. In the centre of"], [410, "LXXXIV ILKLEY 3 ANCIENT AND MODERN. some is a mound, as if the former occupant had been buried there. Not a single pit is found within the enclosed hill, which the Ramblers suggest was a Druidical holy hill. North of Counterhill, on High Edge, 1075 feet high, is another group of pits. The Roman road from Ilkley to Colne is at the foot of the hill. Crossing the ferry from Addingham to West Hall, the Ramblers visited Castleberg in Nesfield. The Wharfe flows at the foot of a precipice, 200 feet deep, and the rest of the hill has been deeply trenched. The third and last pamphlet they issued in 1869. It consisted of twenty-six pages, and had illustrations of the carved rocks. The ramble took place in the spring of that year. \" We are well aware these marks have been observed by other writers, but nearly always assigned by them to the effects of atmospheric influence.\" Along the Eastern edge of the Cow they noticed three shallow rock basins and a series of cups, the rock basins being (as they supposed,) only partly artificial. The cups, they supposed, were made to hold liquid fuel or grease ; the basins to catch the unpolluted rain water. They refer to Borlase's discovery of them in Cornwall, in 1769. On the apex of a rock North of the Cow are other cups, and similarly on the Calf. They refer to fossil marks on the Calf, and the geologist will be gratified with the sight of a gigantic fossil found here, now in Mr. M. Hainsworth's garden. Some of the groups of cups they supposed were for divination, or casting lots. Across Bakestone beck on the highest portion of a rocky ravine they found a supposed idol, with sixteen grooves, and, on the opposite side of the gorge, a flat rock bearing cups. On Greenhill Crag, n 18 feet high, are five basins, a series of cups and channels. It is a boundary rock inscribed T. P., W. M., 1785. Just below are two pyramidal idol rocks with fluted apices. Rocks close to the Shooting Tower bear cup marks. Three quarters of a mile to the South-East they came upon a group of barrows, circular and oval. Near Horncliff circle is a stone bearing cups. On the Bingley Moor, where a great fire in 1868 cleared it for a vast area of its peat, is a barrow 38 yards in circumference, and seven feet high. Near the highest point of Rombalds Moor, on Ilkley Gate, they noticed two pyramidal idol rocks, and a rock bearing cup marks on the margin. Leaving Ilkley, and passing up the Roman road, Weary Hill, the Ramblers report three pits, an upright stone bearing triple egg-shaped figure, and, half-a-mile further, Cowper's Cross, a monolith modernly fashioned into a Calvary Cross. In opposition to their theory that it was probably a market or chapman's cross, we mention that a family of Cowper lived in the valley. South-East from the cross are Two Eggs, two isolated rocks, one of which bears cups on the margin. Three quarters of a mile West is a circle of eighteen stones. Thimble Stones, half-a-mile North of Two Eggs, bear cups on two margins. A little North of Thimble Stones stands a large barrow, elliptical, 175 yards in circuit. The Ashlar Chair, an important boundary stone for four moors, is couch-shaped, and bears many cup marks. A stone"], [411, "BRITISH OR PREHISTORIC REMAINS. LXXXV a sew yards East of it bears cups and grooves, and here the Ramblers make an end of their discoveries, and, shall it be said ? less truthful theories. In 1869, Mr. James Wardell, of Leeds, issued Historical Notices of /Mey, Rombald' s Moor, Baildon Common. A second edition, with notes and additions by Mr. John Holmes, appeared in 1881. The Baildon chapter, reprinted from Bowman's Reliqui\u00e6, was referred to a few pages back. Miss Wardell promised us the blocks of the first edition, but the publisher, Mr. Goodall, could not find them. After the appearance of the second edihon, Mr. Dodgson generously and unsolicited made us a present of them. Mr. Wardell recounts his first visit to Rombalds Moor in November, 1850, and his adventures in a mist. The Horncliff circle he gives a diameter of forty-three feet, and mentions explorations of the inner circle. He concludes it had not been used for sepulchral purposes. Near the highest part of the Moor, which attains an altitude of 1322 feet, he refers to the astronomical circle, previously mentioned, near Lanshaw Lad. Ofthe Barrow, Westward of the \"Skirtful of Stones,\" he gives a picture, and states that at about a foot in depth traces of fire, a quantity of bones and ashes, a flint spear head, (but no urn,) were found. On the face of the rocks, a short distance West of the Cow and Calf, are some ancient markings. \" I can form no idea of their import, but they bear a strong resemblance to lines of earthwork and mounds of the earliest period, and are, I believe, the only ones of their kind yet discovered in this neighbourhood.\" The Summer Camp of the Romans, mentioned in Mr. Coil's letter in the Arch\u00e6ologia, and by Dr. Whitaker, seems to be serpent-shaped, and corresponds, Mr. Holmes thinks, with American earthworks. A Mr. Terry, whilst visiting Ben Rhydding, is generally spoken of as the discoverer of the Cup-and-Ring marked stones here, but a plea has been urged for Mr. Forrest, with the date March ioth, 1868, and for the late Dr. Call, of Ilkley, who noticed the markings on Addingham Moor, 1866, or later. But Borlase's Cornwall treats on them in 1769 ; they were noticed in Northumberland in 1825, and investigations shew that they are to be found in Ireland, Man, France, Switzerland, Spain,"], [412, "ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. LXXXVI Sweden, Denmark, India, Palestine, Moab, Ethiopia, Egypt, Madagascar, Fiji, United States, &c. Mr. John Holmes has been most arduous in his attempts to make the discovery known, by writing articles in the newspapers, attending visitors (both learners and learned,) to exhibit the rocks, taking casts for Museums, and advocating their careful preservation. Mr. J. Romilly Allen, who has had some assistance from Mr. F. W. Fison, of Ilkley, has made the subject a special study for some years, and two of his articles in the British Arch\u00e6ological Journal treat on the Ilkley Rocks. From these, with his permission, we cull the following notices. \" Cow and Calf Rocks: \u2014 Between the quarry and the overhanging edge of the cliff, a portion of the horizontal surface of the rock was some years ago bared of turf, thereby disclosing the group of cup and ring sculptures shown on the accompanying drawing. It will be seen that the design consists of twenty-five cups of various sizes, from i to 3 inches in diameter. Seven of the cups are surrounded by incomplete rings, many of them being connected by an irregular arrangement of grooves. The pattern and execution are of such a rude nature as almost to suggest the idea of the whole having been left in an unfinished state. The sides ofthe grooves are not by any means smooth, and would seem to have been produced by a process of vertical punching, rather than by means of a tool held sideways. The hardness of the rock is attested to by the remains of glacial striations, which are still visible, running in a direction almost due East and West. The rock is at an elevation of 800 feet above the sea level, commanding an extensive prospect of hill and dale. A cast of the sculptures has been taken, and is now deposited in the Museum at Leeds. A quarter of a mile higher up the moor, in a South direction from the Cow and Calf Rocks, near the Pancake Ridge, is a large detached mass of gritstone, covered with cup and ring marks. The block measures 15ft long by 11ft 6ins. broad, by 5ft 6ins. high, and has a central ridge running the whole length of the stone, with sloping surfaces on each side, on which are cut between forty and fifty cups. Nine at least of the cups are surrounded by single con centric rings, but there are no connecting grooves. To the South of this stone, at the foot of Green Crag, is an ancient enclosure, (marked on the Ordnance Map). The walls are of loose stones, and are only just visible above the heather. There are no traces of hut circles within. \" Sculptured Stone near /Ikley Baths. \u2014 On a ridge of ground lying between two streams, about a furlong to the South-West of Ilkley Baths, is an isolated block of gritstone, with cup and ring sculpture. The stone measures 7ft 6ins. long by 6ft. broad, by 2ft. high. The upper surface is flat, and is slightly inclined to the horizon. On it are carved thirteen cups, six of which are surrounded by rings. In the centre are two grooves crossing at right angles. This stone is 700ft. above sea level. \" Sculptured Stone near Graining's Head. \u2014 This stone lies one and a quarter miles South of Ilkley, above Barmishaw Hole, at a level of noo feet above the sea, and is not far from Graining's Head. It is a block of"], [413, "MM."], [414, ""], [415, "BRITISH OR PREHISTORIC REMAINS. LXXXIX gritstone 12ft long by 7ft 6ins. broad, by 4ft high. The largest face slopes at an angle of about 400 to the horizon, and on it are carved nearly fifty cups, sixteen of which are surrounded with single concentric rings. At the West end of the stone are a group, three cups with double rings and radial grooves. At the other end, near the top, is a curious pattern formed of double grooves, and somewhat resembling the ' swastica ' emblem subsequently referred to. At the highest part of the stone is a rock basin 8ins. deep and 9ms. wide. On the vertical end of the stone are cut five cups, three of which have single rings. This is one of the few instances of cup and ring marks occurring on a vertical surface of rock. \" Sculptured Stones near the Panorama Rock. \u2014 The Panorama Rock lies one mile South-West of Ilkley, and from a height of 800 ft. above the sea, commands a magnificent view over Wharfedale and the surrounding country. About 100 yards to the West of this spot appears to be a kind of rough inclosure, formed of low walls of loose stones, and within it are three of the finest sculptured stones near Ilkley. They lie almost in a straight line East and West, the first stone being 5 ft from the second, and the second 100ft from the third The turf was stripped from the first a few years ago, and its having been covered up so long probably accounts for the sculpture being in such good preservation. It measures 1 oft. by 7ft, and is imbedded so deeply in the ground that its upper horizontal surface scarcely rises above the level of the surrounding heath. The sculpture consists of twenty-five cups, eighteen of which are surrounded with concentric rings, varying from one to five in number. The most remarkable feature in the design is the very curious ladder-shaped arrangement of grooves, by which ihe rings are intersected and joined together. I do not think that tnis peculiar type of carving occurs anywhere else besides near Ilkley. The second stone is of irregular shape, measuring 15ft by 12ft, and supporting a smaller stone of triangular shape 6ft long by 4ft broad. 3Both upper and under stone are covered with cups and rings, but the sculptures have suffered much from exposure. The superimposed block has eleven cups, two of which are surrounded by single rings. The under stone has forty-two cups, nine of which have rings. Amongst these are two unusually fine examples, one has an oval cup sins, by 4ms., surrounded by two rings, the diameter of the outer ring being ist. 3ms. Another has a circular cup 3ms. diameter, and five concentric rings, the outer ring being iff. sins, across. The third and most Westerly stone of the group measures 10ft by 9ft, and lies almost horizontally, having its face slightly inclined. On it are carved twenty-seven cups, fourteen of which have concentric rings round them. Some of the cups have connecting grooves, and three have the ladder-shaped pattern before referred to. Several stones near have cup marks without rings. \" Woodhouse Crag Stone. \u2014 Half a mile to the West of the Panorama Rock, on the extreme edge of the cliff forming the North boundary of Addingham high moor, and overhanging the valley of the Wharfe, is a"], [416, "XC ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. large block of gritstone 19ft long by 7ft broad, by 4ft 6ins. thick. At the East end of the stone are two rock basins 1st. 3ms. across, and at the other is carved the very unusual device shown on the ac companying drawing. I consider this to be by far the most interesting of all the Ilkley sculptures, since it is identical with a carving found at Tossene, on the coast of Sweden, North of Gottenburg, and also bears great resemblance to the ' swastica ' emblem of the Buddhists. The example from Sweden is given in Holmberg's Skandinaviens Hiillristningar, plate 32, fig. 102, and the device is so peculiar that there can be little doubt as to the common origin of both this and the one from Ilkley. The ' swastica ' occurs on the foot of Buddha, two specimens of which may be seen at the Indian Museum ; and the Ilkley device appears to be a modification made by doubling the lines and curving the arms. The ' swastica ' was engraved on a very large number of the spindle whorls found by Dr. Schliemann at Troy.* The 'swastica' or 'fylfot' is said to be a symbol of Baal or Woden, t It is also used by the Chinese for the numeral 10,000, called in Chinese 'Wan,' and on account of its highly ornamental character the ' swastica ' forms the element from which many of their most elaborate decorative patterns are derived. \\ The same designs are to be found in connection with the interlaced ornaments of manuscripts and sculptured crosses in Great Britain. The special curved form of the ' swastica ' from Ilkley is well known to schoolboys as the solution of the following puzzle ; ' Four rich men and four poor men had their houses symmetrically situated at the corners of two squares, one inside the other, with a pond in the centre. The rich men determined to build a wall which should exclude the poor men, who had their houses close to the water, from the use of it, and at the same time allow the rich men free access, as before. How was it done ? ' The above problem may possibly owe its origin to the device in questions \"Addingham Crag Stone. \u2014 This stone is situate near the West end of Addingham Crag, at the foot of the cliff. It measures 9ft. 6ins. long by 8ft 6ins. broad. On its upper horizontal surface are cut twenty three cups, twelve of which are surrounded by single concentric rings, and in two cases have connecting grooves. On the West side of the stone is a hole, forming a sort of pocket, which may be natural, or if artificial, perhaps for the deposit of votive offerings. There are two long troughs running across the upper surface of the stone, in the direction of the grain, which appear to have been excavated by the joint agency of the wind, water, and disintegrated pieces of grit. \"Having now completed the description of the most important sculptured stones near Ilkley, it may be as well in conclusion to say a few words about the various theories which have been brought forward to explain their meaning and origin. * See his book on Troy, p. 103. t See Professor Simpson's work, p. 73. X See Williams' Syllabic Chinese Diet. , p. 1040. \u00a7 This device occurs on some of the metal objects found by Dr. Schliemann, at Mycen\u00e6."], [417, "BRITISH OR PREHISTORIC REMAINS. XCI \" i. Natural Origin. \u2014 It has been suggested that a great number of the so called rock basins and cup markings are due to natural causes, such as weathering, and the mechanical action of water. Doubtless this is true in many cases, but the obviously artificial grouping and symmetrical shape, not referable to the lithological composition of the stone, present evidences of design which it is impossible to overlook. As an example of a rock basin of clearly human production that at Rath Michael (co. Dublin) may be mentioned It is of exceedingly regular shape, and cut deep into hard quartzose rock, which has no tendency to weather in this manner. The co-existence of rock basins and cups with concentric rings and grooves makes their artificial character tolerably certain. Nothing, however, but careful examination, combined with an unbiassed judgment, will settle this point in particular instances.* \" 2. Cup and Ring A/arks cut to beguile time. \u2014 It has afforded some pleasure to pessimist arch\u00e6ologists to believe that cup and ring marks were carved by the prehistoric savage in hours of wanton idleness, without a notion on his part as to what he was doing. This theory is wholly inadequate to account for the incessant recurrence of the same forms and groups of marks throughout the whole of Great Britain. Also the production of such sculptures on the hardest rocks, and in the most exposed situations, would, with rude tools, involve more labour than a mere idler would be willing to bestow, and a greater amount of inconvenience than he would be disposed to incur. \" 3. Cup and Ring Marks ornamental. \u2014 Some cup and ring marks may be merely ornaments, but the majority of these sculptures are too carelessly grouped, and the same monotonous forms occur too frequently without being combined into any distinct pattern to give much weight to the theory. \" 4. Religious Symbols. \u2014 Amongst the most probable suggestions is the idea that cup and ring marks were used as religious symbols, since they are continually found associated with burial rites, being carved on the stones of sepulchral circles and chambers, and on the cover stones of cinerary urns. ' In all cases, I believe, in which these sculptured cist or urn covers have been found in Northumberland, the accompanying bones indicate cremation.'! Professor Nilsson believes that cup and ring marks are connected with Baal and sun worship. In support of this a few facts may be mentioned. Cup marks exist on a granite block, known as Balder's Stone, near Falkoping, in Sweden.}; The name Baal occurs continually in the North of England, and in Scotiand; for instance, in Yorkshire, Balderston, Baal's Hills; in Scotland, East coast, Bells Hill, festival of Beltane, etc. The symbol for the sun, used by the Chinese, and also by other nations, is a circle with a dot in the centre, in later times a square with a dash through it. The Greek letter * See Proc. Soe. Ant. Scot., vol. vi. Appendix, p. 4. t See Professor Simpson's work, p. 31. J Ibid., p. 71. Also Journal of this Association, vol. xxxiii, p. 349, paper on Baalism, by Canon Ridgway ; also James Napier's Folklore of Scotland,"], [418, "XCII ILKLEY : ANCIENT AND MODERN. O is the nearest approach to this amongst the alphabets of the Western world, and it may be mentioned that it means a serpent* Mr. Rivett- Carnac, as has been previously mentioned, has found cup and ring marks used in India as symbols of \" Linga \" worship. \"5. Planetarium Theory. \u2014 Some think that the groups of cup and ring marks are maps of the stars, others that they are plans of ancient settlements or camps ; but, as far as I am aware, no arrangement of cups has ever been identified with either any well known constellation or with any ancient remains of villages. \" 6. Miscellaneous Theories. \u2014 Cup and ring marks have been said to be intended for rude representations of objects of everyday use, such as circular shields, annular brooches, etc. Some think that they were burial tablets for the common people, who could not afford to have a megalithic circle erected to their memory. Others think they were used as gambling tables ; but it must be remembered that the marks occur on the vertical and sloping faces of rocks, and also in exposed situations, and again on the cover stones of burial urns. \" Mode of execution of Cup and Ring A/arks. \u2014 Cup and ring sculptures are universally carved on unprepared surfaces of rough stones and rocks, and in many cases no attempt seems to have been made to select the smoothest portions, the carvings following all the inequalities of the stone. They are cut on every description of rock, and those which remain in exposed situations are generally on the hardest gritstone, trap, slate, or granite. The possibility of executing sculptures of this kind on the hardest rocks with a flint implement has been fully established.! The process by which the grooves were cut was in some cases one of punching, and in others of chipping. J The grooves are unpolished. \" Age of the Sculptures. \u2014 Cup and ring marks have never been as yet found in connection with inscriptions of any kind, and may therefore be considered as prehistoric. Beyond this, and the fact of their being found on cromlechs, menhirs, megalithic circles, and other remains of the same period, nothing is at present known which finally determines their age ; but, that it is very considerable, may be gathered from the large area over which these sculptures are found to be distributed. Professor Nilsson refers these sculptures to the bronze age. \" Future Research. \u2014 If the enigma of the import of these mysterious cup and ring marks is ever to be solved it must be by careful research into the relics of Pagan superstition, still lingering in out of the way districts, and even found mixed up with Christian ceremonies, by philological examination of the names of places, and lastly by making careful drawings of the sculptures, topographical notes of the sites, and then instituting a comparative inquiry into similar remains found in other countries.\" Three years afterwards, March, 1882, Mr. Allen read his second paper on the Ilkley Rock-Markings, Mr. Dymond having meantime recorded in the Journal a good example he had found. * See Moab's Patriarchal Stone, by the Rev. James King, p. 125. + See Professor Simpson's work, p. 122. % Ibid. , p. 11."], [419, "BRITISH OR PREHISTORIC REMAINS. XCIII \" Stone on Pancake Ridge. \u2014 A mile and a half South-East of Ilkley, and almost due South of the Ben Rhydding Hydropathic Establishment, will be found marked on the Ordnance Map (scale, 6in. to the mile, sheet 186) a line of cliffs, called Pancake Ridge, just at the edge of Rumbold's Moor, and overhanging the valley of the Wharfe. Perched on the top of the cliff is a large, flat slab of gritstone, which, from its peculiar form, has obtained the name of the ' Pancake Rock.' On its upper surface are several cup-markings,* much obliterated by the action of the weather, but some of them sufficiently distinct to prove their origin artificial, and to shew that this rock was noticed in ancient times, and very possibly considered an object either of worship or superstition. About 150 yards to the West ofthe Pancake Rock, close to the edge of the cliff, and at a level of 1010ft above the sea, is the sculptured stone to be described. It is a piece of gritstone, measuring 5ft. 3m. by 5ft, and is ist 9m. high. On its upper surface, which is nearly horizontal, are carved thirteen cups, varying in diameter from 2in. to 2^in., eleven of which are surrounded by single rings. There is also an elaborate arrangement of connecting grooves, which will be best understood from the accompanying drawing. \" Stone at the foot of Green Crag. \u2014 A quarter of a mile to the South of Pancake Ridge, and higher up the moor, is a short line of cliffs, called ' Green Crags.' Between these two sets of cliffs, which are nearly parallel, and run East and West, is a comparatively level stretch of moorland, the total rise between the two being 60ft. At the West end of Green Crag, at the foot of the cliff, will be found, marked on the Ordnance Map, an ancient enclosure. It is of approximately rectangular form, and its walls of loose stone project so little above the surrounding heather as to be only just visible. The use of this curious structure is not clear, as there are no traces of hut-circles within it. Two hundred yards or so to the East of this enclosure, at the foot of Green Crag, are three large gritstone boulders having cup-markings, lying a few yards from each other. About twenty yards from these is the stone having upon it the beautiful specimen of prehistoric sculpture here illustrated. (See fig.) The stone is of grit, and measures 3ft. 2in. by 2ft. 6in. Its upper surface is nearly horizontal, and has carved upon it cups varying in diameter from 2in. to 3in. A row of cups in the middle of the stone are entirely surrounded by a groove. There is also a channel running round the outside. Single cups are often found encircled by one or more concentric rings ; but it is very exceptional indeed to find several cups surrounded by a single groove, or to find the cups so symmetrically arranged as in the present instance. \" On the plateau lying between Green Crag and Pancake Ridge is also situated the large cup-marked boulder described in my former paper.! It lies to the North of the stone just mentioned. \"Stone on Weary Hill. \u2014 One mile South-West of Ilkley, is a road *Casts have been sent to Leeds Phil. Museum by Mr. Holmes. \\Jour. Brit. Arch.

XCIV leading over the top of the Moor, and the most rapid part of the ascent is marked on the Ordnance Map (6in. scale, sheet 186) very appro priately as Weary Hill. To the West of the road, and between it and the boundary-wall of Silver Well Farm, is a small boulder of gritstone with cup-markings on it It lies at a level of 900ft. above the sea, and it measures 8ft by 5 ft On its upper surface, which is nearly level, are carved ten cups, varying in diameter from 2in. to 3m., one of them being surrounded by a single ring. The ' Neb Stone,' which is at the upper extremity of the boundary-wall of Silver Well Farm just mentioned, and which is 1 100ft above the sea, has also cup-marks upon it The group of sculptured rocks near the Panorama Stone, described in my previous paper,* lies at the foot of Silver Well Farm. \" Stone near Piper's Crag. \u2014 Piper's Crag is situated two miles West of Ilkley, at a level of 1050ft above the sea, and is at the East end of the long line of cliffs known as Addington Crags, which extend in a Westerly direction for some miles, and form the natural boundary between Rumbold's Moor and the valley of the Wharfe. At the edge of Piper's Crag is a horizontal rock-surface, and on a portion of it, measuring 5ft by 7ft, are carved a series of fifteen cups, varying in diameter from 2in. to 3m. Of these, one is surrounded by a single ring, four by a double ring, and one by a triple ring. \" On the same line of cliffs, half a mile to the East, midway between Piper's Crag and the Panorama Stone, is situated the large boulder on Woodhouse Crag, described in my former paper,! bearing the curious pattern resembling a ' swastica ' with curved arms. I take this oppor tunity of acknowledging a mistake in my drawing of this stone, pointed out by Mr. Dymond.J \"A quarter of a mile East of Piper's Crag is a large mass of grit, called the ' Sepulchre Stone,' and a quarter of a mile to the West is another, called the ' Noon Stone.' Neither of these has sculptures upon it ; but both are of striking appearance. \" The Doubler Stones. \u2014 The Doubler Stones are situated on Rumbold's Moor, three miles South-South-West of Ilkley, as the crow flies, and two miles East of the village of Silsden. The place is difficult of access, and can be reached either by following the road from Ilkley to Addingham, and striking up into the Moor just beyond the latter place, or by going up at once into the Moor from Ilkley to the Panorama Stone, and walking along the top of the long line of cliffs called ' Addingham Edge.' These cliffs, as before mentioned, run due East and West, and form the South side of the valley of the Wharfe. They terminate at a point two miles West of the Panorama Rock, where they attain a height of 1200 feet above the sea, the views over the surrounding country being everywhere grand in the extreme. Half a mile South of the West end of the cliffs are the Doubler Stones, situated at a level of 1100 feet above the sea, and overlooking the ''Ibid. , p. 20. \\fourn. Brit. Arch.

These rocks are by far the most remarkable freaks of nature to be seen in the district. They occupy a prominent position, perched on the extremity of a rocky knoll which juts out into the valley; and as seen from below, with their weird forms standing out clear and sharp against the background of blue sky, they present so extraordinary an appearance, that they would at once attract the attention of even the most unobservant. In general outline, they resemble gigantic toadstools ; and I presume that they are called the Doubler Stones from the fact of their shapes being almost identical, They may be appropriately described as Nature's twins. The stones lie East and West, the Eastern one being on the very edge of the cliff, and the other further inland, towards the moor. I call the Western stone a, and the Eastern one b, for the sake of distinction. The distance between the stones is 30ft., and the intermediate ground is level. Each stone consists of a pillar 6ft. in diameter, supporting a flat slab or cap, the top of which is level, and at a height of 6ft, above the ground. The cap of stone a measures 11 ft. by 11 ft, and is 1st thick; and that of b, nft 3m. by 10ft, and 1st thick. The shape in plan is roughly oval, or rather a rectangle with its corners rounded. The shape of the stones which form part of the rock on which they stand seems to be purely natural, and due to the fact of the strata lying horizontally ; the top slab being of hard material, and the underlying rock soft, so that it has gradually become worn away by the action of the weather. Both stones, however, present traces of the work of man on their upper surfaces. There is no difficulty in climbing on to the top of stone a, as there are natural steps on the side away from the cliff; but the top stone, b, is not so easy of access, which may account for there being fewer artificial sculptures on it. The upper surface of the cap of stone a has three large basin-shaped cavities in it. .Two of these lie along the central axis of the stone, and measure respectively ist. 3m. by 2ft. by 9in. deep, and ist. 9m. by ist. 3m. by 9m. deep. They are united by a deep groove, a continuation of which runs out over the edge of the stone at each end. There is another basin lying to the West side of the two central ones, with one of which it is connected by grooves. It measures 2ft by ist 9in., and is 9m. deep. There is no direct evidence that these basins are artificial ; but it is quite possible that they may have been so originally, and have been enlarged by natural agencies. But in addition to the basins are twenty-six cup-markings of distinctly artificial origin. They vary in diameter from 2 to 4m. One group of cups appears to be arranged in a series of parallel rows. \"Stone b has no basins on its upper surface, but I counted eight cup-markings. Whether these wonderful stones were Druidical altars or not, I do not pretend to say, but at any rate they are well worthy of the attention of the geologist and antiquary. \"There are some prominent masses of rock higher up the moor, called ' The Gawk Stones,' but I could detect no carvings upon them.\" WM.
