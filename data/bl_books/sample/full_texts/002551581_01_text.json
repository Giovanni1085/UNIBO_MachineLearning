MY SHADOW. \u2014 Robert Louis Stevenson. I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me, And what can be the use of him is more than I can see ; He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head ; And I see him jump before me when I jump into my bed. The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow \u2014 Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow ; For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball, And he sometimes gets so little that there 's none of him at all. He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play, And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way ; He stays so close beside me he 's a coward you can see \u25a0 I 'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me ! One morning very early, before the sun was up, I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup ; But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head, Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed. (By kind permission of Charles Baxter, Esq.)"], [10, "2 HIS NAMES. HIS NAMES.\u2014 Anon. Never a boy had so many names ; They called him Jimmy, and Jim, and James, Jeems and Jamie ; and well he knew Who it was that wanted him too. The boys in the street ran after him, Shouting out loudly, 'Jim, hey, Jim-m ! ' Until the echoes, little and big, Seemed to be dancing a Jim Crow jig. And little Mabel, out in the hall, ' Jimmy, Jimmy ! ' would sweetly call, Until he answered, and let her know Where she might find him, she loved him so. Grandpapa, who was dignified, And held his head with an air of pride, Didn't believe in shortening names, And made the most he could of James. But if papa ever wanted him, Crisp and curt was the summons, 'Jim ! ' That would make the boy on his errand run Much faster than if he had said, ' My son.' LITTLE BY LITTLE. Little by little the bird builds her nest ; Little by little the sun sinks to rest : Little by little the waves, in their glee, Smooth the rough rocks by the shore of the sea."], [11, "GOOD-NIGHT AND GOOD-MORNING. 3 Drop after drop falls the soft summer shower ; Leaf upon leaf grows the cool forest bower ; Grain heaped on grain forms the mountain so high, That its cloud-capped summit is lost to the eye. Little by little the bee to her cell Brings the sweet honey, and garners it well ; Little by little the ant layeth by, From the summer's abundance, the winter's supply. Minute by minute, so passes the day ; Hour after hour years are gliding away. The moments improve until life be past, And, little by little, grow wise to the last. GOOD-NIGHT AND GOOD-MORNING Lord Houghton. A fair little girl sat under a tree, Sewing as long as her eyes could see, Then smoothed her work, and folded it right, And said, ' Dear work, good-night ! good-night ! Such a number of rooks came over her head, Crying ' Caw ! caw ! ' on their way to bed ; She said as she watched their curious flight, ' Little black things, good-night ! good-night ! ' The horses neighed, and the oxen lowed ; The sheep's 'bleat ! bleat ! ' came over the road; All seeming to say, with a quiet delight, ' Good little girl, good-night ! good-night ! '"], [12, "4 THE REMORSEFUL CAKES. She did not say to the sun, ' Good-night ! ' Though she saw him there, like a ball of light, For she knew he had God's time to keep All over the world, and never could sleep. The tall pink foxglove bowed his head, The violets curtsied and went to bed ; And good little Lucy tied up her hair, And said, on her knees, her favourite prayer. And while on her pillow she softly lay, She knew nothing more till again it was day : And all things said to the beautiful sun, ' Good-morning, good-morning ! our work is begun. THE REMORSEFUL CAKES.\u2014 Eugene Field. A little boy named Thomas, ate Hot currant cakes for tea \u2014 A very rash proceeding, as We presently shall see. He went to bed at eight o'clock, As all good children do, But scarce had closed his little eyes, When he most restless grew. He flopped on this side, then on that, Then keeled up on his head, And covered, all at once, each spot Of his wee trundle-bed. He wrapped one arm around his waist, The other 'round his ear, While mamma wondered what on earth Could ail her little dear."], [13, "NOWHERE. 5 h He fell asleep, and as he slept He dreamt an awful dream, Of being smacked with hazel rods, Without the power to scream. He dreamt a great big lion came And reared and raved and roared \u2014 While on his breast two furious bulls In mortal combat gored. He dreamt he heard the flap of wings Within the chimney-flue \u2014 And down there crawled, to gnaw his ears, An awful bugaboo ! When Thomas rose next morn, his face Was pallid as a sheet \u2014 ' I never more,' he firmly said, ' Will cakes for supper eat ! ' NOWHERE. [A song for boys and girls who are always discontented.] Ella Wheeler Wilcox. Do you know where the summer blooms all the year round Where there never is rain on a picnic day, Where the thornless rose in its beauty grows, And the little boys never are called from play ? Oh ! hey 1 it is far away, In the wonderful land of Nowhere. Would you like to live where nobody scolds, Where you never are told, ' It is time for bed,' Where you learn without trying, and laugh without crying, Where nurses don't pull when they comb your head ? Then oh ! hey ! you must hie away To the wonderful land of Nowhere."], [14, "6 TALE OF A DOG AND A BEE. u 'j If you long to dwell where you never need wait, Where no one is punished or made to cry, Where a supper of cakes is not followed by aches. And little folks thrive on a diet of pie ; Then ho ! hey ! you must go, I say, To the wonderful land of Nowhere. You must drift down the river of Idle Dreams, Close to the border of No Man's Land \u2022 For a year and a day you must sail away, And then you will come to an unknown strand And ho ! hey ! if you get there \u2014 stay In the wonderful land of Nowhere. TALE OF A DOG AND A BEE.\u2014 Anon. Great big dog, Head upon his toes ; Tiny little bee Settles on his nose. Great big dog Thinks it is a fly, Never says a word, Winks very sly. Tiny little bee Tickles dog's nose \u2014 Thinks like as not 'Tis a blooming rose. Dog smiles a smile, Winks his other eye, Chuckles to himself How he '11 catch a fly."], [15, "nancy's nightmare. 7 Then he makes a snap, Very quick and spry, Gets the little bug, But doesn't catch the fly. Tiny little bee, Alive and looking well, Great big dog, Mostly gone to swell, MORAL. Dear friends and brothers all, Don't be too fast and free, And when you catch a fly Be sure it 's not a bee. NANCY'S NIGHTMARE.\u2014 Laura E. Richards /am the doll that Nancy broke ! Hadn't been hers a week. One little squeeze, and I sweetly spoke ; Rosy and fair was my cheek. Now my head lies in a corner far, My body lies here in the other ; And if this is what human children are, I never will live with another ! /am the book that Nancy read For fifteen minutes together ; Now I am standing here on my head, While she 's gone to look at the weather. My leaves are crushed in the cruellest way, There 's jam on my opening page ; And I would not live with Miss Nancy Gay, Though I shouldn't be read for an age !"], [16, "8 kitty and mousie. > /am the frock that Nancy wore Last night at her birthday feast ; I am the frock that Nancy tore In seventeen places at least. My buttons are scattering far and near, My trimming is torn to rags ; And if I were Miss Nancy's mother dear, I 'd dress her in calico bags ! We axe the words that Nancy said When these things were brought to her view All of us ought to be painted red, And some of us are not true. We sputter and mutter and snarl and snap, We smoulder and smoke and blaze ; And if she 'd not meet with some sad mishap, Miss Nancy must mend her ways. KITTY AND MOUSIE.\u2014 Anon. Once there was a little kitty, White as the snow ; In a barn she used to play, Long time ago. In the barn a little mousie Ran to and fro ; For she heard the little kitty, Long time ago. Two black eyes had little kitty, Black as a crow ; And they spied the little mousie, Long time ago."], [17, "TWO OF THEM. 9 Four soft paws had little kitty, Paws soft as snow ; And they caught the little mousie, Long time ago. Nine pearl teeth had little kitty, AU in a row ; And they bit the little mousie, Long time ago. When the teeth bit little mousie. Mousie cried out ' Oh ! ' But she slipped away from kitty, Long time ago. TWO OF THEM.\u2014 Mrs Lucy M. Blinn. Grandfather 's come to see baby to-day, Dear little, queer little baby Ned ; With his toothless mouth, his double chin, And never a hair on his shiny head, He looks in the pretty eyes of blue, Where the baby's soul is peeping through. And cries, with many a loving kiss, ' Hallo ! what little old man is this ? ' Baby stares in grandfather's face, Merry old, cheery old 'Grandfather Ned,' With his toothless mouth, his double chin, And never a hair on his dear old head ; He scans him solemnly up and down. From his double chin to his smooth, bald crown And says to himself as babies do, ' Hallo ! can this be a baby, too ? '"], [18, "10 THE WATER-BLOOM. THE WATER-BLOOM.\u2014 Celia Thaxter. A child looked up in the summer sky, Where a soft, bright shower had just passed by; Eastward the dusk rain-curtain hung, And swiftly across it the rainbow sprung. ' Papa ! papa ! what is it ? ' she cried, As she gazed with her blue eyes opened wide At the wonderful arch that bridged the heaven, Vividly glowing with colours seven. ' Why, that is the rainbow, darling child,' And the father down on his baby smiled. ' What makes it, papa ? ' ' The sun, my dear, That shines on the water-drops so clear.' Here was a beautiful mystery ! No more questions to ask had she, But she thought the garden's loveliest flowers Had floated upward and caught in the showers \u2014 Rose, violet, orange, marigold \u2014 In a ribbon of light on the clouds unrolled ! Red of poppy, and green leaves too, Sunflower yellow, and larkspur blue. A great, wide, wondrous, splendid wreath It seemed to the little girl beneath ; How did it grow so fast up there, And suddenly blossom, high in the air ? She could not take her eyes from the sight : ' Oh, look ! ' she cried in her deep delight, As she watched the glory spanning the gloom, ' Oh, look at the beautiful water-bloom ! '"], [19, "SUPPOSE ! 11 SUPPOSE !\u2014 Anon. Suppose, my little lady, Your doll should break her head, Could you make it whole by crying Till your eyes and nose are red ? And wouldn't it be pleasanter To treat it as a joke, And say you 're glad 'twas Dolly's, And not your head, that broke ? Suppose you 're dressed for walking, And the rain comes pouring down, Will it clear off any sooner Because you scold and frown ? And wouldn't it be nicer For you to smile than pout, And so make sunshine in the house, When there is none without ? Suppose your task, my little man, Is very hard to get, Will it make it any easier For you to sit and fret ? And wouldn't it be wiser, Than waiting like a dunce, To go to work in earnest, And learn the thing at once ? Suppose that some boys have a horse, And some a coach-and-pair, Will it tire you less, while walking, To say, ' It isn't fair ' ? And wouldn't it be nobler To keep your temper sweet, And in your heart be thankful You can walk upon your feet ?"], [20, "12 THE DEAD KITTEN. And suppose the world don't please you, Nor the way some people do ; Do you think the whole creation Will be altered just for you ? And isn't it, my boy or girl, The wisest, bravest plan, Whatever comes or doesn't come, To do the best you can ? THE DEAD KITTEN.\u2014 Sydney Dayre. ' Don't talk to me of parties, Nan ; I really cannot go ; When folks are in affliction they don't go out, you know. I have a new brown sash, too ; it seems a pity \u2014 eh ? \u2014 That such a dreadful trial should have come just yesterday ! ' The playhouse blinds are all pulled down as dark as it can be ; It looks so very solemn, and so proper, don't you see ? And I have a piece of crape pinned on every dolly's hat ; Tom says it is ridiculous for only just a cat. ' But boys are all so horrid ! They always, every one, Delight in teasing little girls and kitties, \"just for fun.\" The way he used to pull her tail \u2014 it makes me angry now \u2014 And scare her up the cherry-tree, to make the darling \" meow !\" ' I 've had her all the summer. One day, away last spring, I heard a frightful barking, and I saw the little thing In the corner of a fence; 'twould have made you laugh outright To see how every hair stood out, and how she tried to fight. ' I shooed the dog away, and she jumped upon my arm ; The pretty creature knew I wouldn't do her any harm ; I hugged her close, and carried her to mamma, and she said She should be my own wee kitty if I 'd see that she was fed."], [21, "WHICH LOVED THE BEST. 13 ' A cunning little dot she was, with silky, soft gray fur ; She 'd lie for hours on my lap, and I could hear her purr ; And then she 'd frolic after when I pulled a string about, Or try to catch her tail, or roll a marble in and out. 'Such comfort she has been to me I 'm sure no one could tell, Unless some other little girl who loves her pussy well. I 've heard about a Maltese cross, but my dear little kit Was always sweet and amiable, and never cross a bit ! ' But oh, last week I missed her ! I hunted all around ; My darling little pussy-cat was nowhere to be found. I knelt and whispered softly, when nobody could see : \" Take care of little kitty, please, and bring her back to me ! \" ' I found her lying yesterday behind the lower shed ; I thought my heart was broken when I found that she was dead. Tom promised me another one, but even he can see No other kitty ever will be just the same to me 1 ' I can't go to your party, Nannie \u2014 macaroons, you say ? And ice-cream ? \u2014 I know I ought to try and not give way ; And I feel it would be doing wrong to disappoint you so ! \u2014 Well \u2014 if I 'm equal to it by to-morrow \u2014 I may go ! ' WHICH LOVED THE BEST.\u2014 Anon. ' I love you, mother,' Said little John ; Then, forgetting his word, His cap went on, And he was off To the garden swing, And left her wood And water to bring. B"], [22, "14 WHICH LOVED THE BEST. ' I love you, mother,' Said rosy Nell ; ' I love you better Than tongue can tell ! ' Then she teased and pouted Full half a day, Till her mother rejoiced When she went to play. ' I love you, mother,' Said little Fan ; ' To-day I will help you All I can. How glad I am That school doesn't keep ! ' So she rocked the baby Fast asleep. Then, stepping softly, She brought her broom And swept the floor And tidied the room. Busy and happy All day was she \u2014 Helpful and happy As child can be. ' I love you, mother,' Again they said \u2014 Three little children Going to bed. How do you think That mother guessed Which of them really Loved her best ?"], [23, "TEDDY THE TEASER. 15 TEDDY THE TEASER.\u2014 M. E. B. He wanted a velocipede, And shook his saucy head ; He thought of it in daytime, He dreamed of it in bed, He begged for it at morning, He cried for it at noon, And even in the evening He sang the same old tune. He wanted a velocipede ! It was no use to say He was too small to manage it, Or it might run away, Or crack his little occiput, Or break his little leg \u2014 It made no bit of difference, He 'd beg, and beg, and beg. He wanted a velocipede ! A big one, with a gong To startle all the people, As they saw him speed along ; A big one, with a cushion, And painted red and black, To make the others jealous And clear them off the track. He wanted a velocipede, The largest ever built, Though he was only five years old And wore a little kilt, And hair in curls a-waving, And sashes by his side, And collars wide as cart-wheels, Which hurt his manly pride !"], [24, "16 TEDDY THE TEASER. He wanted a velocipede ! Why, he was just as tall As six-year-old Tom Tucker, Who wasn't very small ! And feel his muscle, will you ? And tell him, if you dare, That he 's the sort of fellow To get a fall or scare ? They bought him a velocipede \u2014 Oh, woe the day and hour ! When proudly seated on it, In pomp of pride and power, His foot upon the treadle, With motion staid and slow, He turned upon his axle, And made the big thing go. Alas for the velocipede ! The way ran down a hill \u2014 The whirling wheels went faster, And fast and faster still, Until, like flash of rocket, Or shooting-star at night, They crossed the dim horizon And rattled out of sight. So vanished the velocipede, With him who rode thereon ; And no one, since that dreadful day, Has found out where 'tis gone ! Except a floating rumour Which some stray wind doth blow, When the long nights of winter Are white with frost and snow,"], [25, "THE PUZZLED SCHOOLMASTER. 17 Of a small fleeting shadow, That seems to run astray, Upon a pair of flying wheels, Along the Milky Way. And this, they think, is Teddy ! Doomed for all time to speed \u2014 A wretched little phantom boy, On a velocipede ! THE PUZZLED SCHOOLMASTER. Ella Wheeler Wilcox. 'You've quizzed me often and puzzled me long, You 've asked me to cipher and spell, You 've called me a dunce if I answered wrong, Or a dolt if I failed to tell Just when to say lie and when to say lay, Or what nine sevens may make, Or the longitude of Kamchatka Bay, Or the I-forget-what 's-its-name lake ; So I think it 's about my turn, I do, To ask a question or so of you.' The schoolmaster grim, he opened his eyes, But said not a word for sheer surprise. ' Can you tell what \" rounders \" means ? I can. Can you say all off by heart The \"onery twoery ickery ann,\" Or tell \" alleys \" and \" commons \" apart ? Can you fling a top, I would like to know, Till it hums like a bumble-bee ? Can you make a kite yourself that will go 'Most as high as the eye can see,"], [26, "18 HANG UP BABY'S STOCKING. Till it sails and soars like a hawk on the wing, And the little birds come and light on its string ? ' The schoolmaster looked, oh ! very demure, But his mouth was twitching, I 'm almost sure. ' Can you tell where the nest of the swallow clings, Or the colour its eggs may be ? Do you know the time when the squirrel brings Its young from their nest in the tree ? Can you tell when the chestnuts are ready to drop, Or where the best hazel-nuts grow ? Can you climb a high tree to the very tip-top, Then gaze without trembling below ? Can you swim and dive, can you jump and run, Or do anything else we boys call fun ? ' The master's voice trembled as he replied : ' You are right, my lad ; I 'm the dunce,' he sighed. HANG UP BABY'S STOCKING. Hang up the baby's stocking : Be sure you don't forget : The dear little dimpled darling Has never seen Christmas yet. But I told him all about it, And he opened his big, blue eyes ; I am sure he understood it, He looked so funny and wise. Ah, what a tiny stocking ! It doesn't take much to hold Such little toes as baby's, Safe from the frost and cold."], [27, "HANG UP BABY'S STOCKING. 19 But then, for the baby's Christmas, It never will do at all ; For Santa Claus wouldn't be looking For anything half so small. I know what will do for baby ; I 've thought of a first-rate plan : I '11 borrow a stocking of grandma \u2014 The longest that ever I can. And you shall hang it by mine, mother, Right here in the corner \u2014 so ; And write a letter for baby, And fasten it on the toe. ' Old Santa Claus, this is a stocking Hung up for our baby dear ; You never have seen our darling, He has not been with us a year. ' But he is a beautiful baby ! And now, before you go, Please cram this stocking with presents. From the top of it down to the toe. ' Put in a baby's rattle, Also a coral ring, A bright new ribbon for his waist ; Some beads hung on a string. ' And mind a coloured ball, please, And a tiny pair of shoes ; You '11 see from this little stocking The size you have to choose.'"], [28, "20 THE STORY OF GRUMBLE TONE. THE STORY OF GRUMBLE TONE, Ella Wheeler Wilcox. There was a boy named Grumble Tone, Who ran away to sea ; ' I 'm sick of things on land,' he said. ' As sick as I can be ; A life upon the bounding wave Will suit a lad like me.' The seething ocean billows failed To stimulate his mirth, For he didn't like the vessel, Or the dizzy rolling berth, And he thought the sea was almost As unpleasant as the earth. He wandered into foreign lands, He saw each wondrous sight, And nothing that he heard or saw Seemed just exactly right ; So he journeyed on and on, Still seeking for delight. He talked with kings and ladies fair; He dined in courts, they say, But always found the people dull, And longed to go away, To search for that mysterious land Where he should like to stay. He wandered over all the world ; His hair grew white as snow ; He reached the final bourne at last Where all of us must go, But never found the land he sought. The reason would you know ?"], [29, "DAISY DILL. 21 The reason was, that north or south, Where'er his steps were bent, On land or sea, in court or hall, He found but discontent, For he took his disposition with him, Everywhere he went. DAISY DILL.\u2014 F. E. Weatherley. Climb along, climb along, sweet Daisy Dill ; 'Tis a long way to the top of the hill, And the road is so rough, and the sun in the skies Makes little Daisy Dill blink her blue eyes. But climb along, climb along, sweet Daisy Dill, You '11 soon be all safe at the top of the hill. Climb along, climb along, sweet Daisy Dill, Now she 's at last at the top of the hill ; Tired ! yes, of course she is ; glad just to rest, And look back to the valley she 's left in the west. Tired ! but it 's worth it, my sweet Daisy Dill, To be really at last at the top of the hill. And life, like your journey, my sweet Daisy Dill, Is a very long pull up a very steep hill ; And some reach the top, and some of us never, Although we go toiling and struggling for ever. Never mind ; we '11 still struggle ; 'tis far better so, Than to die in a ditch in the valley below ; So climb along, climb along, sweet Daisy Dill, You '11 soon be all safe at the top of the hill. (By kind permission of the author.)"], [30, "22 THE SPIDER AND HIS WIFE. THE SPIDER AND HIS WIFE. In a little dark house, a few feet from the ground, An honest old spider resided. So pleasant, so snug, so convenient 'twas found, That his friends came to see it for many yards round ; It seemed for his pleasure provided. He thought that the little his wife could consume, With care he might always provide her ; Forgetting he lived in a gentleman's room, Where there came every morning a maid with a broom- A pitiless foe to a spider. One day, when their cupboard was empty and dry, His wife, a most diligent spinner, Said : ' Now, my dear, go to the cobweb and try If you can't find the leg or the wing of a fly, As a nice little relish for dinner.' He went without thinking of what might befall, For nothing he ever denied her; Brush came the great broom down the side of the wall, And, alas ! carried with it web, dinner, and all ; And thus ended the days of poor spider. MY WINDOWS. Windows I have two : Are they white and blue ? Are they brown and white ? Either may be right. From these windows two I can look at you,"], [31, "MY WINDOWS. 23 Or else I can gaze, Through the summer haze, On the meadows green Where the hay has been. If in winter's snow To the town I go, Do these windows stay ? No ! they come away, Look on chimneys tall, Houses great and small, Often dark and gray, Veiled in fog all day ; Such the sights that I From them do espy. But (what sounds most strange) E'en the windows change, As, o'er streets and ways, Forth from them I gaze. If I feel delight, Then they glisten bright ; Funny sights I see, Then they dance with glee ; Am I vexed and grim ? Dull they are and dim ; Am I sad with you ? They are veiled in dew ; If I fain would doze, They their shutters close ; Am I foolish? Wise? Read it in these eyes."], [32, "THE ARROW AND THE SONG. 24 J THE ARROW AND THE SONG. H. W. Longfellow. I shot an arrow into the air, It fell to earth, I knew not where ; For, so swiftly it flew, the sight Could not follow it in its flight. I breathed a song into the air, It fell to earth, I knew not where ; For who has sight so keen and strong, That it can follow the flight of song ?

A little boy had bought a Top, The best in all the toyman's shop ; He made a whip with good eel's skin : He lash'd the Top, and made it spin ; All the children within call, And the servants, one and all, Stood round to see it and admire. At last the Top began to tire ; He cried out, ' Pray don't whip me, Master You whip too hard \u2014 I can't spin faster ;"], [33, "THE LAST LEAF. 25 I can spin quite as well without it.'

Oft within our little cottage as the shadows gently fall, While the sunlight touches softly one sweet face upon the wall, Do we gather close together, and in hushed and tender tone, Ask each other's full forgiveness for the wrong that each has done. Should you wonder why this custom at the ending of the day, Eye and voice would quickly answer, ' It was once our mother's way ! ' If our home be bright and cheery, if it hold a welcome true, Opening wide its door of greeting to the many, not the few; If we share our Father's bounty with the needy, day by day, 'Tis because our hearts remember this was ever mother's way. Sometimes, when our hands grow weary or our tasks seem very long ; When our burdens look too heavy, and we deem the right all wrong, Then we gain a new fresh courage, as we rise to proudly say : ' Let us do our duty bravely ; this was our dear mother's way.' Thus we keep her memory precious, while we never cease to pray That at last, when lengthening shadows mark the evening of the day, They may find us waiting calmly to go home our mother's way !"], [37, "GENTLEMAN JOHN. 29 GENTLEMAN JOHN.\u2014 F.

But all of a sudden these naughty young things Grew as quiet as two little mice, For the house-door was open ; if they could get in, They thought it would be very nice. So into the hall then they trotted, and on Through the half-open dining-room door, And as it was dinner-time, snapped up some peas Which baby had dropped on the floor.

Two unveiled faces full of joy looked upward to the Throne, Four white wings folded at the feet of Him who sat thereon. And deeper than the sound of seas, more soft than falling flake, Amidst the hush of wing and song the Voice Eternal spake : Welcome, my angels ! ye have brought a holier joy to heaven ; Henceforth its sweetest song shall be the song of sin forgiven !

Two roses once in my garden grew : The one was brilliant and rich of hue ; Proud of her beauty and perfume rare, She spread her sweets to each passing air : The other, timid and chaste of mind, Shrank from the kiss of the fickle wind ; Proud in the pride of her virtue meek, She veiled the blush on her modest cheek. Dazed with the glare of her gaudy bloom, Drunk with the breath of her rich perfume, I tended the one with ceaseless care ; I marked the growth of each beauty rare, And dreamed that all on some future day Would own the power of her peerless sway.

I saw too now, with awakening eyes, How near I had been to my longed-for prize ; One half of the care I had spent in vain \u2014 Care that had brought me but grief and pain \u2014 If spent on the rose that had pined away, Would have reared a flower so chastely gay, That the joy of its countless charms untold My care had repaid a thousandfold.

Along the margin of the sea A youth with shining face there came, His soul steeped in love's mystery, And breathing oft a dear one's name. The shell sang to his yearning ear That song which all the spirit fills ; And on his soul her voice fell clear From o'er the sundering hills. An aged man with silvery hair Came slowly o'er the gleaming strand ; With faint smile on his face of care He took a smooth shell in his hand. No song for him of emerald seas It sang, but breathed of woe and pain : He heard sad voices in each breeze, And sighed for youth again ! IN VANITY FAIR.\u2014 Florence Tylee. Through Vanity Fair, in days of old, There passed a maiden with locks of gold, And a pedlar opened his tempting pack, Crying : ' O my pretty lass ! what d' ye lack ? Here 's many a ware Costly and rare. Come, buy \u2014 oh, come, buy ! In Vanity Fair.' ' Silks and satins are not for me ; Lace is for damsels of high degree ; The lads would laugh in our country town If I came clad in a broidered gown ; But yet there 's a ware, Precious and rare, I fain would buy me In Vanity Fair."], [145, "THE FIREMAN. 137 -j ' Pray, sell me, sir, from your motley store, A heart that will love me for evermore, That, whether the world shall praise or blame. Through sorrow or joy will be still the same. 'Tis the only ware For which I care, 'Mid all the treasures In Vanity Fair.' ' Much it grieves me, O lassie dear,' The pedlar said ; ' but I greatly fear The hearts that loved in the old sweet way Have been out of fashion this many a day ; And gilded care Is all the ware You will get for your money In Vanity Fair.' THE FIREMAN.\u2014 Camilla Crosland. The city lies in hushed repose, The wintry night- wind freshly blows, As if to rock the cradled host In slumber's sweet oblivion lost. But hark ! a sound, and a shout of fright, That wakes the town in dead of night. A shriek and a glare, A cry of despair At the flames in their ire, For the one word is ' Fire ! ' The people rush out, And, with hurry and shout, Press on to the light As it brightens the night,"], [146, "138 IF I WERE YOU. And spreads like a banner unfurled up on high, A sign and a terror against the dark sky ! But hark to the clatter, than music more sweet Of the rolling wheels and the horses' feet ! ' Out of the way \u2014 out of the way ! They come to save \u2014 now clear the way 1 ' A sea of faces upward turned, One fear by every heart inurned ; By ruddy light is clearly read On every brow the anxious dread. A mother 'mid the bright light stands, Her neck tight clasped by baby hands, And through roar and hiss, Not quite they miss Her piteous frenzied cry ; But mounting quick on high A hero springs, His helm a star Of hope, that flings A halo far 'Mid the lurid light, For a moment lost, then dimly seen As it gleams on the sight, The curling wreaths of smoke between ! Up the ladder one rushed, but three come dowTi, And the shining helm is a hero's crown ! Yet heeds not he what people say, He only bids them ' clear the way ! ' IF I WERE YOU.\u2014 G Clifton Bingham. ' Why did he look so grave ? ' she asked. ' What might the trouble be ?

' ' I think I 'd tell it somebody,' Said she, ' if I were you ! ' But still he sighed and looked askance, Despite her sympathy. ' Oh, tell me, little maid,' he said Again, ' if you were me, And if you loved a pretty lass, Oh then, what would you do ? ' ' I think I 'd go and tell her so,' Said she, ' if I were you ! ' ' My little maid, 'tis you,' he said, ' Alone are dear to me.' Ah, then she turned away her head, And ne'er a word said she. But what he whispered in her ear, And what she answered too \u2014 Oh no, I cannot tell you this ; I 'd guess, if I were you ! LIFE'S JOURNEY.\u2014 Ella Wheeler Wilcox, As we speed out of youth's sunny station The track seems to shine in the light ; But it suddenly shoots o'er chasms, And sinks into tunnels of night. And the hearts that were brave in the morning Are filled with repining and fears As they pause at the City of Sorrow Or pass through the Valley of Tears."], [148, "life's journey. 140 us, But the path for this perilous railway The hand of the Master has made ; With all its discomforts and dangers, We need not be sad or afraid. Roads leading from gloaming to darkness, Roads leading from gloom to despair, Wind out through the tunnels of midnight. To fields that are blooming and fair. Though the rocks and their shadows surround Though we catch not one gleam of the day, Above us fair cities are laughing And dipping white feet in some bay; And always, eternal, for ever, Down over the hills in the west, The last final end of the journey, There lies the great Station of Rest. 'Tis the grand Central Point of all railways ; All roads cluster here where they end ; 'Tis the final resort of all tourists ; All rival lines meet here and blend ; All tickets, or mile-books, or passes, If given, or begged for, or bought, On whatever road or division, Will bring you at last to this spot. If you pause at the City of Trouble, Or wait in the Valley of Tears, Be patient, the train will move onward And sweep down the track of the years. Wherever the place is you seek for, Whatever your aim or your quest, You shall come at the last with rejoicing To the beautiful Station of Rest. Edinburgh : Printed by W. & R.
