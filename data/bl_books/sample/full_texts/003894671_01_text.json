To realise the full charm of Aldbourne you should stay in it, or, still better, live in it, as did the actors in our story. But in their days Aldbourne was far more beautiful than now. The high embankment which forms the railway, and cuts off the greater part of the village from view of the river and of the wooded hills beyond, was then hardly an embryo in the engineering brain, while the builder of the villa abomina tions which desecrate the river's sacred banks had not yet begun to construct houses of cards with his baby fingers. Indeed men were thinking more of pulling down than of building up ; at least so said the Tories who gathered nightly in the pleasant parlour of the ' King's Head,' Aldbourne's best inn. It was the year after the passing of the Catholic Emancipation Bill, and that measure was still regarded by many good subjects as the first step towards national ruin, some of the inn's more vehement spirits affirming that the Great Duke had better have fallen"], [15, "I A LAD IN SEARCH OF A VOCATION 3 at Waterloo than have lived to sap the Constitution. Moreover, there began to be great talk of a Eeform Bill, and the results of further meddling with the existing state of things were tremblingly foreboded. Disturbing as these matters were to the village elders, they did not trouble the young folk of Aldbourne, and there might have been no such things as politics in the world, so far as cared a youth and maiden, who, one lovely afternoon towards the end of May, reposed on a high grassy slope at the edge of Thorndon Wood, with the Ullen flowing beneath them. The view from this height was pretty enough to have taken their atten tion, but they had seen it often, and the lad now chose to lie flat on his back, with the old year's winding-sheet of leaves for a couch, and to stare through the overhanging boughs of a beech - tree at the blue sky above ; while the girl- \u2014 a piece of cardboard in her hand and a paint-box beside her \u2014 copied, with more care than ability, a bluebell which she had found in a shady nook, loitering behind its fellows to enjoy the balmy air"], [16, "A BORN PLA YER CHAP. 4 of May. The pair looked about of an age, and you would not have guessed that age at more than nineteen years. 'The beech and larch are trying which shall be the greener, and I really can't say which wins,' observed the lad dreamily in a musical voice, and with an accent free from the least touch of rusticity. 'The larch is the more feathery, and the sky through its plumes looks almost green, while the beech is as distinct as lattice-work.' ' I wish you would not be so lazy,' said the girl, raising her head from her work, and showing a pale face set with small features, a face which would perhaps have been unat tractive had not a pair of very soft brown eyes shed a pleasant light on it. She wore a gray gingham frock and a short-waisted black spencer. Her white straw bonnet she had hung on a hawthorn bush close by, because it interfered with her occupation ; for at the date of our story a bonnet was by no means a ' cockle or a walnut shell,' but a thing of such goodly size that, in order to see the face of a woman with a"], [17, "I A LAD IN SEARCH OF A VOCATION 5 bonnet on, you must get quite in front of the wearer. ' Please tell me if this bluebell is right,' continued she in a gentle voice, but with a shade of provincialism in the accent. ' It is so much harder to paint from a real live flower than from a picture of one.' 'Of course,' returned her companion with some scorn. ' Everybody knows how easy it is to copy a copy. You see a dab here and a stroke there ; you imitate them ; and behold your picture ! But the real thing in painting as in other arts is \"to hold the mirror up to Nature.\"' ' I don't know how to hold the mirror up to Nature,' said the girl, sighing softly. ' You must teach me. And, Matt, don't you think that arose would look nice with this bluebell, the rose I have done once or twice before ? ' ' What ? A garden rose \u2014 a July rose with a bluebell? Grace, Grace, do you call that holding the mirror up to Nature V Here the lad kicked out his legs by way of protest and overturned a paint-box and a sketch which lay beside him."], [18, "6 A BORN PLA YER CHAf. '0 Matt, pray get up and finish your picture,' urged the busy maiden. ' Perhaps you'll not have another holiday afternoon like this, warm and clear and still.' ' It is the lovely afternoon that makes me lazy. I want to do nothing but lie and listen to the birds. Hark ! there is a nightin gale gurgling a little, just to remind his brother warblers that he has not given up singing yet, and they needn't be so pleased with themselves. Listen, what a chorus of thrushes ! they have got the spring into their throats and no mistake ; while the blackbirds keep in their mellow notes a remembrance of the winter. ' ' How wildly you have talked lately,' said the girl, half reproving, half admiring. ' I think mother would call it nonsense.' ' I am like a big man I read about the other day, I find nonsense very refreshing,' retorted her companion, and gesticulating skywards in rather theatrical fashion, he continued, 'Ay, my sweet -throated knaves, I sympathise with you, for I remember the winter bitterly too \u2014 the cold schoolroom in"], [19, "A LAD IN SEARCH OF A VOCATION 1 7 the day, the dismal little study in the evening, and nothing to break the monotony of either but caning a boy or going to a prayer-meeting. I could never bear the dreariness if it were not ' ' If it were not for what ? ' asked Grace, as he stopped suddenly. ' If it were not for you,' he answered, turning his head towards her and smiling lightly, while at the same time, with an odd tenderness, he smoothed his coat pocket. A glow came over Grace's pale face, warm ing and beautifying it as the sunset flush warms and beautifies snow mountains. Matt looked at her admiringly, and was about to add further speech, when the sound of quick footsteps, crushing the beech leaves in the wood, checked his words. ' Who comes so out of season ? ' he muttered to himself. The question was answered by the appear ance of a short but portly man, of rubicund countenance, with the dress and bearing of a country squire. This personage, issuing suddenly from the thick shade of the wood,"], [20, "8 A BORN PLA YER CHAP. nearly stumbled over the pair of legs which lay right across his path. ' What business have you here ? ' he de manded, pulling himself up, and speaking in the lofty tone not infrequently adopted by the landowner to the straying landless. 'Are you aware that you are trespassing ? ' The lad's colour came, but he made no attempt to rise, and with as much haughtiness as his lowly position allowed, said \u2014 ' If I am trespassing, so are you, for this wood belongs to the squire of Thorndon.' ' You insolent fellow ! Do you know who I am ? ' cried the newcomer, his face growing redder and redder, his rather prominent eyes winking in quick wrath. You would have thought the reply to his magniloquent question would have been the Cloud-compeller himself. ' Yes, I know you,' answered Matt quietly. ' You are the Eev. Dr. Beauchamp, rector of Aldbourne and landlord of Poppy Farm, but not of Thorndon Wood \u2014 that belongs to Mr. Poyntz.' ' And you are the Dissenting minister's"], [21, "I A LAD IN SEARCH OF A VOCATION 9 pupil, and are to be a schismatic preacher yourself, I hear ; there is no doubt you have the necessary assurance for the character,' returned the other, with a keen glance at the prostrate lad. The face he contemplated must have exercised some mollifying influence over him, for he continued in a milder tone \u2014 ' Well, well, you never learned insolence from Mr. Unwin, who is as modest and retiring a man as I know.' ' Almost too much so, sir, is he not ? ' said the young man, leaping lightly to his feet. ' He should hand the surplus over to me.' Could you have seen Matt, as he stood before the parson, you would have compre hended in a twinkling the latter's change of tone. Eather over middle height, well proportioned, spare too \u2014 as youth should be \u2014 he was a pleasant sight to behold. Moreover, the figure was matched by as fair a face. His brown hair curled round a shapely head, his dark gray eyes shone now with fun, now with serious thought, and gave the effect of sunlight and shadow passing over the landscape on a bright June day. For the rest, if he smiled,"], [22, "A BORN PLA YER 10 CHAF. as he did now, you would not have stayed to catalogue either beauties or defects, but have recognised this as a face whose owner must of necessity be forgiven his sins unto seventy times seven. ' Exactly so,' returned the rector, in sharp staccato tones ; ' modesty is particularly be coming in young folks. You tell him from me that he is to teach you modesty as well as Latin. I hear he is a good Latinist. Ah, what a pity ! what a pity that he isn't in the Church \u2014 a man like that, a scholar and a ' ' A gentleman, you would say, sir,' inter posed Matt eagerly, as Dr. Beauchamp hesitated to pronounce a word which would set the son of a village apothecary on a level with parsons and squires. A certain Austrian magnifico declared humanity to begin with the barons ; the English squirearchy of fifty years ago believed gentlehood to begin with them selves. ' Well, well, he is a scholar and a good man,' said Dr. Beauchamp, avoiding acqui escence in Matt's assertion, ' but mistaken in his choice of a calling, and still more mistaken"], [23, "I A LAD IN SEARCH OF A VOCATION n in being the first to bring schism into a peaceful parish.' Alarmed both at the rector's attack and Matt's bold defence, the girl had not until now proffered a word. This aspersion, however, on a man so nearly related to her as was the minister, made her forget the silence in which, as befitted her sex, she was accustomed to hear arguments theological, political, or social. ' My father did not bring the division,' she said, modestly but firmly ; ' the chapel was built and the congregation formed before he was offered the pastorate, and if he had not accepted it, some one else would have done so.' 'No doubt, no doubt,' responded Dr. Beauchamp testily ; ' but that doesn't alter the fact. He was my first opponent here.' ' Opponent ! 0 no, sir ! you are both preachers of the Gospel.' ' Well done, Grace ! ' ejaculated Matt under his breath, and with a comical twinkle of his eyes. The speech could indeed sound nothing but ironical to ears used to the philippics of certain blatant theologians of the parish, who"], [24, "A BORN PLA YER CHAP. 12 were quick to pronounce Dr. Beauchamp as ignorant of the Gospel as any South Sea islander. ' Gospel, Gospel ! ' echoed the parson. ' From what I can understand, each sectary has a Gospel of his own. There seem to be as many Gospels as meeting-houses. But naturally the daughter thinks her father in the right.' Here the speaker broke off, and scrutinised Grace as he had scrutinised Matt. He had, of course, occasionally met the minister's daughter in the village, but he had never bestowed any especial attention on her. What he saw now evidently pleased him, for he went on \u2014 ' Well, well, if you are as good as you look, you are very good ; but you must not pretend to argue on religious matters. Girls have got plenty to do to think about their bonnets and their sweethearts.' Saying this, he gave a quick glance at Matt, who responded by a gay smile, while Grace blushed rosy red, and looked so pretty in her maiden shame as quite to win the rector's heart. ' Ay, ay, and painting is a nice employ ment too. Come, let us see your picture."], [25, "I A LAD IN SEARCH OF A VOCATION 13 Bluebells, eh ? Very wTcll done indeed,' he said, as Grace reluctantly showed her flower piece. ' Nice girl's work, much better for them than religious argument. And you, young man ; have you been doing nothing but lie on dry beech leaves with fresh ones for a roof? Ah, the beech is the most hospitable of trees. \" Sylva domus, cubilia frondes.\" Do you know that ? ' ' I know what it means,' said Matt smiling, ' but I don't know the author.' ' What ? wrhat ? not know Juvenal, and Mr. Unwin such a scholar ! ' ' Juvenal is not included in the Noncon forming minister's course,' said Matt drily. ' I suppose he is not considered improving.' ' Absurd squeamishness ! All the classics are improving,' returned the rector, with happy impartiality. To tell the truth, Dr. Beauchamp's remem brance of classic authors was bedimmed by time. He had never been a great student, and of his university days he retained little save that intangible something, which is not scholar ship, but, as it were, the aroma thereof, and"], [26, "A BORN PLAYER CHAP. 14 which Alma Mater alone can bestow. This, like the scent of the rose, survives long years, and it survived with the rector, but it did not prompt his tribute to the beech-tree ; he had found that in a book which served him as a vade mecum and was dear to him \u2014 perhaps dearer than the Prayer-book \u2014 Evelyn's Sylva. For Dr. Beauchamp was learned in forestry, and as great an authority on the cultivation of trees as any man in the kingdom. Matt did not care to pursue the question of classic authors, but picking up his sketch he presented it to the rector. ' If you will look at this, sir,' he said, ' you will see that I have not been altogether idle.' ' Why, what have we here ? ' cried Dr. Beauchamp. ' The view before us, I declare ; the river, the hills, the trees. Excellently done. You are quite an artist. Come now, hadn't you better give up the idea of preaching and take to painting ? ' ' I have no vocation for either,' returned Matt quickly, his eyes resting with great eagerness on the parson's self-satisfied coun tenance. Probably he did not there find what"], [27, "A LAD IN SEARCH OF A VOCATION I 15 he sought, for he continued lightly, ' I was looking for my vocation when you discovered me lying under the trees. So please, sir, another time when you come upon a harmless lad and lass, do not ask them what business they have either upon your own or any other gentleman's property. One may be pursuing art in a strictly feminine fashion, and the other looking out for a vocation.' ' You have a fine glib tongue of your own,' began Dr. Beauchamp in returning wrath, but the bright countenance before him was irresist ible, and wTith a short laugh he went on \u2014 ' Well, well, whatever calling you hit on, you'll have plenty of face to carry it through. Good day, good-day ; ' and so saying he went off at a sharp trot down the slope, carrying both his stout person and his sixty years with ease. Matt stood looking after him until he dis appeared, then puffing out his cheeks, and, as it seemed, his whole body, with a perfect imita tion of the parson's voice and style he repeated that gentleman's greeting \u2014 ' What business have you here ? Do you know that you are trespassing ? '"], [28, "16 A BORJV PLA YER CHAP. In spite of her belief that mimicry was wrong, Grace laughed a little, but quickly composing her face she went on with her work, while Matt, throwing himself again upon the ground, continued in his own natural manner \u2014 ' These petty tyrants of the fields are enough to make us all revolutionists. What right have they to monopolise the earth so ? One would think by the airs they give themselves that they expected to carry away their land with them when they die. Nobody must pick wild flowers, listen to wild birds, or look at views on the property of a village squire. I have read in an ancient volume that \" the earth is the Lord's.\" The assertion isn't true here anyhow. The earth belongs to Squire Poyntz, Squire Carew, and Dr. Beauchamp.' ' Matt, how you talk ! ' said Grace rather shocked ; ' and how you answered Dr. Beau champ ! I hope he won't complain to father.' ' He wouldn't dream of such a thing,' re turned Matt confidently. ' He is peppery, but not ill-natured. I wonder how he came by his degree. It must be a precious easy thing to become a Doctor of Divinity. He"], [29, "I A LAD IN SEARCH OF A VOCATION 17 knows as much of theology as I do about planting trees, and you may be sure that bit of Latin has stuck to him because it is in praise of the beech ; but as to reading, I be lieve he would find it hard now to construe either Virgil or Augustine.' ' Matt,' ventured Grace timidly, not troub ling herself about the parson's scholarship ; ' what did you mean by saying the ministry was not your vocation ? ' ' Do you think it is my vocation ? ' I hope so \u2014 I hope so ; you could do such good service in the cause.' ' You are a dear little Puritan, and would look sweetly in the proper frock and hood.' ' But, Matt,' persisted Grace, not to be turned from the great subject even by pleasant words, ' you will not grieve us by relinquish ing the ministry.' ' Suppose for a moment that I have no call.' ' Perhaps the call will come if you wait and pray,' said Grace reverently. ' And you are so clever, and speak so well. You would preach so beautifully.' c"], [30, "18 A BORN PLA YER CHAP. ' Preach !

Such a course with us would mean starvation.' ' I never heard you talk so wildly as you do to-day ; it is a good thing father cannot hear you,' said Grace, rising from the ground ; and possibly reminded of the impending meal by Matt's solemn closing word, she proceeded\u2014 ' We must really start for home, or we shall"], [31, "A LAD IN SEARCH OF A VOCATION ig 1 keep tea waiting. I heard the church clock strike four long ago.' At Grace's reminder Matt rose also ; not that he felt the healthy vacuum within which generally answered to the thought of food, but meals in the minister's house were not mov able feasts ; they must be partaken of at a certain hour, nor would any member of the household dream of absence from them with out serious cause. Lading himself, therefore, with the sketching materials, and taking- Grace's hand, Matt ran with her down the slope into the hollow beneath, and then out into the high road, which at this point divides the Ullen from Archer's Hill. The hill is a bold chalk ridge clothed with grass, its side set here and there with wild Guelder-rose, bramble, yew, and juniper. Our pair climbed the steep ascent, and pur sued their way to the village. But on the height, perhaps influenced either by the sky above or the view below, Matt showed a dis position to loiter. ' Come and sit in the devil's arm-chair,' he urged, trying to tempt Grace a few steps"], [32, "A BORN PLA VER CHAr. 20 down the hillside to where, in the fork of an ancient yew, was a comfortable seat with a pretty good semblance of back and arms. But Grace was intent on household thoughts, and would not be beguiled. ' Well, if you will not stay, I shall,' said Matt. ' Tea will not be ready yet, so I shall just sit and look at the view till the chinch clock strikes five. I can get home in two minutes.' ' Don't be late, then, or mother will be vexed,' said Grace, as she went away. Matt, left alone, did not climb the devil's arm-chair, but flung himself at full length on the downy grass, crushing a fine bed of wild thyme \u2014 which, though not yet in bloom, sent up a sweet smell \u2014 and turned his back on the view he had lingered to enjoy. And yet from hence it was charming indeed. The small part of Aldbourne that could be seen consisted of an old house at the hill's foot, a few quaint cottages, and a low thatched inn, while over the shoulder of the hill peeped a red-brick church tower. The river-side inn, which bore and bears the name of ' The"], [33, "A LAD IN SEARCH OF A VOCATION I 21 Cygnet,' was then, as it is now, a great resort of anglers on the Ullen, but was not then, as it is now, a place of small craft, since at the period of our story the delights of boating were untasted by the general world. The Ullen flowed to-day in imperceptible motion until it reached the weir which closes it in between Aldbourne and the opposite village of Thorpe, when it fell over the bar with a dreamy sound. Upon it the sunlight lay, broad and dazzling, save where the bordering trees cast a shade. These were clad in their freshest foliage ; the chestnuts, too, were set all over with silver cones, while the hawthorns, bowed down by the weight of snowy flowers, dipped their branches in the stream. Among the trees on the Thorpe side of the river the little spire of a church pointed heavenwards, and above it rose hills, here wooded, here covered with short grass, or partly cultivated, all seeming to shut in the happy valley from the perturbations of a tumul tuous world. Even the life and freshness of spring hardly came with any rousing power into this home of repose \u2014 this Sleepy Hollow."], [34, "A BORN PLAYER CHAP. I 22 But youth is often independent of its surroundings, and Matt's heart was now beat ing in warm eager pulsations as, with his face close to the wild thyme, he read from a pamphlet that he had taken out of his coat pocket. Had an intruder peeped over his shoulder, he would have discovered that the book contained neither the harmonious verse of Virgil nor the heart-cry of St. Augustine, of which the lad had just discoursed so readily, but with some surprise he would have per ceived this title, ' Venice Preserved, a Tragedy, by Thomas Otway ' ; and with yet more sur prise would have beheld, spread out on the turf, a bill whereon was declared in stately language that Mr. Edmund Kean and com pany would, on the morrow and two following nights, perform in the Theatre Eoyal in the county town of Dulford these plays : The Man of the World, Venice Preserved, and King Lear."], [35, "CHAPTER II THE MINISTER AT HOME The house to which Grace Unwin directed her steps stood in the village street and near the river. From its windows could be seen the rush of water over the weir and the bridge connecting Ahlbourne with Thorpe. It was an old substantial house of red brick, in past days the residence of the doctor, and appeared a better dwelling than you would have sup posed to be within the means of a village Nonconformist minister. But the Rev. William Unwin kept a school, and thus eked out the income derived from his chapel \u2014 an income always narrow, and occasionally shrink ing in a very perplexing way. A simple iron railing closing in a little garden space, set with two variegated hollies and two bays, separated the house from the"], [36, "A BORN PLA YER CHAr. 24 village street. The house door stood invit ingly open ; and well might the minister's door present no barrier to any comer, since the riches within were not material, but mental and moral, and little likely to attract the thief. Passing through a rather dark hall paved with brick, Grace entered the family sitting room, which was at the back of the house, with windows opening upon the large and ill kept garden. The room bespoke poverty ; the table stood on rickety legs, the stuffing peeped through the chair -covers, the carpet and curtains were threadbare, and now, as the western sun streamed on them, they looked shabbier than ever. A bookcase full of volumes testified to the minister's love of literature ; his favourite books, however, were not here, but in his sanctum over the schoolroom. This latter had, in the doctor's time, been a surgery, the study a consulting-room, and grim tales were afloat among the boys of a cupboard in the upper chamber wherein Mr. Unwin, upon taking possession, had discovered a veritable skeleton, grinning with frightful complacency."], [37, "II THE MINISTER AT HOME 25 The ghastly grin was still to be seen, they said, flitting up and down the narrow stairs which led from the schoolroom lobby to the study. Hence in the early darkness of winter there was much huddling together of bristling heads, and when the hour of freedom came much scampering of nailed boots, signs of alarm not to be wTondered at, since the allow ance of candles in the minister's household was small. ' Am I late ? ' asked Grace, seeing the tea on the table, while her mother \u2014 ever quick to employ spare moments \u2014 busily mended a stocking. 'Well, it isn't five yet,' allowed Mrs. Unwin, in a thin toneless voice ; ' but I've been fidgeting in case your father should come in and want his tea. You shouldn't drive the time so near.' Grace did not answer ; she seldom replied to her mother's fault-finding ; but having first gone into the kitchen and ascertained that the kettle was boiling \u2014 a point always in dispute between Mrs. Unwin and the maid, Kezia \u2014 she got her thimble and began to help her"], [38, "26 A BORN PLA YER CHAP. mother. Darning, however, is an employment that leaves the thoughts pretty free, and Grace, sitting close to the open window through which a tender breeze wafted the scent of fast fading wallflower, was divided between wonder at Matt's strange talk this afternoon, and anxiety lest he should linger on the hill long enough to provoke a scolding. That any member of her family should be late for a meal seemed to Mrs. Unwin as cruel an offence as to a cabinet-minister it would appear were a partisan late for a division ; and reasonably, since the daily meals were to her as important as political measures to a statesman, having to be planned with as much foresight and a good deal more economy than the Budget itself. Fortunately the minister and his wife had not a large family. Three daughters composed it, and two of these were married \u2014 Martha to a minister who served a chapel in the north of England, and Rachel to a farmer on the other side of Dulford, known among his neigh bours as a well-to-do but close-fisted man. Mrs. Unwin was small and thin, with a"], [39, "II THE MINISTER a4T HOME 27 face intended by Nature to be pleasing, but spoiled by the absence of flesh and the pre sence of care. It had the harassed expression often to be seen on the countenances of women who are always bent on making two ends meet which obstinately refuse contact. The necessity of pruning here and snipping there, the never having a shilling to spend cheerfully, must, one would think, crush even high spirits, and Mrs. Unwin's had never been high. If her economies had issued in an easier state of things, there wTould have been some satisfaction in them, but their only result was to keep the wolf from the door. Mr. Unwin, like many a Nonconformist minister, had to prove the full bitterness that the voluntary system can inflict upon him who lives by it ; but nothing in his experience of it hurt him and his family so much as the dilatoriness of the seat-holders with their payments. He would rise in chapel to give notice, as, alas ! he was often compelled to do, that the pew-rents were long overdue, his beautiful mild face troubled and almost indignant, while Mrs. Unwin felt herself on the verge of tears, Grace flushed with shame,"], [40, "A BORN PLA YER 28 CHAP. and Matt gnashed his teeth in impotent wrath. Had Mrs. Unwin taken any pleasure, it would most certainly have been sadly ; but pleasure was not for her. Matters of the house engrossed her. She never went for a walk except to chapel, nor read a book except on Sundays, when she nodded over a volume of Whitefield's sermons. For she bad been bred a Calvinist, and took her religion sadly. To see her at chapel, with her usually mourn ful expression intensified, no one would have supposed that she considered the place a little heaven below, and pictured the Heaven above as Aldbourne chapel enlarged and eternal. Grace had hardly plodded through a single hole of her stocking when she heard a rapid footstep and a gay whistle coming round the side of the house, and Matt, his hands in his pockets, his cap at the back of his head, passed the parlour window. ' I really think that Matt should give up whistling,' said Mrs. Unwin plaintively ; ' it doesn't seem consistent in a candidate for the ministry.'"], [41, "II THE MINISTER AT HOME 29 ' Father is always glad to hear him whistle,' retorted Grace, quite sharply. ' He says he loves to have young folks cheerful.' Grace was saved further defence of Matt by the lad's entrance, and as she glanced up at him she could not but be struck by the con trast he presented to the typical Noncon formist preacher. ' What ! isn't tea ready ? ' he asked. ' I am dying of hunger.' ' That is a most wild way of talking,' re monstrated Mrs. Unwin feebly. 'Dying of hunger ! when you had a good dinner at one o'clock.' ' It is metaphorical, I know,' returned Matt lightly ; ' but then, for a preacher, metaphor is everything. Don't you remember the sen sation little Daw made with his metaphors ? Mr. Unwin's sermons fell quite flat after wards. And yet Daw talked nothing but twaddle.' ' I don't like to hear you make fun of ministers,' protested Mrs. Unwin. ' It isn't right.' ' Why not ? Ministers are men, and often"], [42, "30 A BORN PLAYER CHAP. very ridiculous men. How are you to help laughing at them ? ' ' But their sacred office ' Renders them more ridiculous,' interrupted Matt boldly. Somehow Mrs. Unwin 's argu ments always roused him to contradiction.

The quotation was out of Matt's mouth before he could stop it.

' And you, Grace, and you, ma'am, mustn't judge all from one. You have lived so many years with Mr. Unwin that you suppose other ministers to be like him. I tell you they are no more like him than ' Here the door opened, and Matt's simile was cut short by the entrance of its subject. The minister was a spare man, and, but for a slight stoop, would have been over middle height. He had steady gray eyes, a broad forehead, and snowy hair. His face was that of a scholar, refined and thoughtful, and though not handsome as to feature, was ex alted into beauty by its expression. This the casual observer called mild and gentle, but he who saw farther beheld in it a verification of these ancient words : ' The work of right eousness shall be peace.' Dr. Beauchamp has already proclaimed Mr. Unwin a scholar, and Matt has declared him a gentleman. He was both these, and he was something more. O We who judge by present facts are apt to"], [44, "A BORN PLA YER CHAP. 32 associate Nonconformity with noisy politics, with a jealous watchfulness of the National Church, with a constant readiness for attack ; and, knowing that minds perturbed by such emotions cannot be serene enough for the growth of the gentler graces, we suppose there to be some natural antagonism between Dis sent and saintliness. The Church of Rome has, beyond all doubt, produced the greatest saints \u2014 men and women who combined in a quite unique way loftiness of aim with sim plicity of life and sweetness of manners, who, while their feet touched earth, had their con versation in Heaven. The Church of England can show her saints too, and at any rate in past days there sprang out of the ungenial soil of Nonconformity itself a few men who ex hibited that exquisite blending of the human and divine which makes the saint. Such men are not to be read of as partisans at public meetings, nor are they lengthily recorded in year-books ; yet they existed, and of them the minister of Aldbourne was one. ' I am afraid you have waited for me,' he said, as he came into the parlour. ' Now that's"], [45, "THE MINISTER AT HOME II 33 a pity \u2014 and this lad with his fine appetite too.' ' You have been hindered, I suppose ? ' said Mrs. Unwin questioningly. ' Yes ; I was called to a sick person. I will tell you presently,' he answered, and lifting his hand he blessed the food. Matt dashed into the bread and butter with seeming gusto ; his appetite was, how ever, soon satisfied, while the minister evi dently did not care to eat, and Grace, at once apprehending that his abstraction was due to deep feeling, and afraid lest her mother should ask him questions, began to talk about her afternoon's employment. ' We have had a beautiful walk, father,' she said, ' and have done some painting.' ' Good children,' responded the minister, patting her arm. ' Painting is delightful work for a holiday afternoon.' 'And while we were so agreeably occu pied,' said Matt, ' who should appear on the scene but Dr. Beauchamp, very angry with us for \" trespassing,\" as he called it, though why he should feel it his pro- o"], [46, "A BORN PLAYER CHAP. 34 vince to guard Thorndon Wood I can't understand.' ' I hope you were respectful, Matt,' said the minister, with some anxiety. ' You are so soon ablaze, I know ; and I would not have anything happen to break my peaceful rela tions with the rector.' ' We were both rather hot at first,' allowed Matt, ' but we soon cooled down, and I assure you, sir, we were quite good friends before we parted.' 'Yes, father,' said Grace, 'he was very amiable, and talked pleasantly to both of us.' ' That is well,' said the minister, much relieved. ' Dr. Beauchamp has behaved with great forbearance towards me ever since my coming here, showing no displeasure when I have visited his people, nor withdrawing his material help from them. Leaving, therefore, those things whereon we are not called upon to pass judgment, we may truly speak of him as a generous and a kindly man.' ' So polite to ladies, too,' said Mrs. Unwin ; ' and he a bachelor. I do wonder why he has"], [47, "II THE MINISTER AT HOME 35 never got married. He must be very dull all alone in that big house, poor man.' 'He seems a good deal more lively than most married men,' asserted Matt ; ' and, as Grace says, he talked away to us ever so. He praised her flowers and my sketch, and even advised me to follow painting as a profession.' ' As a profession ! ' said Mr. Unwin. ' Well, I really think you like painting better than Greek.' ' But he must study, or he won't have room to laugh at \" ignorant creatures,\" as he calls Mr. Daw and Mr. Barry,' said Mrs. Unwin, with the air of putting to rights that always exasperated Matt, though in the minis ter's presence he rarely let his vexation appear. Mr. Unwin looked pained, but a glance at Matt's face softened his reproof, so that it sounded almost like commendation. ' Why, Matt, my lad, who wTould think you had been brought up a Calvinist, when you seem to expect the Wesleyan doctrine of per fection to be illustrated in the persons of its"], [48, "36 A BORN PLA YER CHAP. ministers. Now Mr. Barry is a good man, and has worked with much zeal among the poorer members of his connection ; if then his scholarship be small, and his arguments flimsy, we must remember that the itinerant minister has little chance either of reading or thinking deeply. He who enjoys his books in a quiet sanctum, and, in the pleasant monotony so helpful to meditation, perpends great truths, should not be hard on him who is always jogging hither and thither, now on a sorry steed, now on his own aching legs, through fresh scenes and in all weathers. Indeed, when I consider how much both of study and thought must be given to the preparation of a single sermon, I am filled with wonder that these ever -travelling ministers can preach at all.' ' That's true, sir,' assented Matt, ' and I would have remembered it, but Mr. Barry would not suffer me. He talked as if not only were all hidden things clear to him, but as if he could make them clear to us also, were we not such miserable dunderheads. Now this assumption in a man who does not always"], [49, "II THE MINISTER AT HOME 37 discriminate between the nominative and accusative cases is too much.' ' The people to whom Mr. Barry preaches are untroubled by his confusion of cases,' said the minister. ' Indeed, his hearers probably listen to him with all the greater profit because his speech resembles their own. They are of the same opinion as the carpenter here, who, when I asked him why he left us and went to the Primitive Methodist meeting, replied, \" Waal, tain't what ye says, but the way ye says it, as I can't do wi'. I loikes a preacher as doan't talk no foiner than me.\" So you perceive how these \" brown -bread preachers,\" as good old John Wesley called them, are acceptable to some tastes. With regard to Mr. Barry's love of argument, he overrates his own powers therein, but many a theologian does that.' ' Not you, sir ; you are more likely to over rate anybody's powers than your own. Isn't he, ma'am ? ' cried Matt, turning to Mrs. Unwin, sure of sympathy here. ' He even lets Deacon Masters argue with him when he could crush him in a moment.'"], [50, "38 A BORN PLAYER CHAP. ' I do not feel at all sure of that,' returned Mr. Unwin, with a broad smile. ' The worthy deacon never strikes me as a man to be easily crushed. He is a true Briton ; he doesn't know when he is beaten.' ' He is too self-satisfied and too ignorant to know,' Matt blurted out hastily. ' Matt, Matt !

As she stirred, her mother drew near with some wine sent from the rectory, but she turned from it, and, still looking at me, she whispered, \" Read.\" I read the twenty-third Psalm, and could but think that to Anna the \" valley of the shadow of death\" seemed even as a \"green pasture.\" After the Psalm I spoke a few words. While I spoke a certain drowsiness fell on her, and when I had ended she murmured, \" Now I'll say my prayers ; it's time to sleep.\" I listened intently, and heard her repeat in a faint flutter ing voice the Lord's Prayer, and then the Apostles' Creed. At the words, \" the Life everlasting,\" her eyes closed, her head sank a little. We thought she had gone to sleep, and so she had \u2014 into the sleep of death.'

' she murmured, ' and Anna was only eighteen \u2014 younger than either Matt or I.' ' Well, it's a good thing for her, poor soul, that her mother took to coming to chapel, or she wouldn't have had much spiritual comfort,' said Mrs. Unwin. Then with a puzzled expression she continued \u2014 ' Anna was a good Christian, I do believe, but I don't see how she could call the Apostles' Creed a prayer.' ' It sounded like one,' returned her husband, rising as she struck the jarring note, and be taking- himself to his study. You are perhaps surprised, dear reader, to find a man like the Rev.

The change of opinion befell him when his only child, whose birth had cost the mother her life, was but eight years old. The lad had there fore grown up in Nonconformity, and more over with the prospect before him of becoming a preacher, since the father fondly believed that his son's early readiness in speech pre destined him to be a second Whitefield.

That other was the minister of Aid bourne, whom Mr. Hare appointed Matt's sole guardian, charging him to bring up the boy as the young Timothy was brought up \u2014 ' in earnest application to reading, exhortation, and teaching.' Yet, though educated in all the straitness of the new Puritanism, the parson's son had kept, as we have seen, a decided freedom both of opinion and expression, towards which three things contributed about equally \u2014 the exuber ance of life within him, the scholarship acquired from Mr. Unwin, and the occasional visits he paid to his mother's relations, who were by no means rigid religionists. During the greater part of Matt's life in the minister's family other youths had kept him company, but just now he was the sole boarder there, though day-scholars were still numerous.

There were, indeed, old-fashioned farmers who hated Method ism as they hated Popery, and who sternly reprehended the laxity of such neighbours as entrusted their children's education to a Non conformist. These, however, were few, and their strictures were met by certain unanswer able arguments. Mr. Unwin always voted on the Tory side, and always spoke respectfully of the Church and clergy ; indeed, there were not wanting people who said that he would have been a Church clergyman himself, only he could not stomach the king's supremacy. To some of the farmers' wives this squeamish ness did not appear altogether surprising, since, like the sex in general, quick to reduce any argument ad hominem, they for their parts could not wonder at anybody questioning that article of the faith, when such a man as the present king was head of the Church. To the sons, therefore, of both farmers and"], [57, "in MATT EVADES A PRAYER-MEETING 45 tradesmen Matt taught the beginnings of knowledge, and a very wearisome task he often found it, but it had never seemed so in tolerable as on the afternoon following that of the sketching expedition. Mr. Unwin sat at his desk hearing a boy stumble through some phrases of the Delectus, while Matt him self drooped over a row of boys who were laboriously writing ' Knowledge is Power.' ' You are never likely to prove your text,' he said, rapping a set of refractory knuckles ; ' \" Ignorance is Bliss \" should be your theme.' The owner of the knuckles began a loud whimper, causing Mr. Unwin to look up with a troubled expression. This was the fifth boy who had wept under Matt's rule to-day. ' You are not well, my lad,' said the good man kindly, and in truth Matt's bright face had strangely altered since yesterday \u2014 his red cheeks had paled into a yellowish whiteness, and there were dark circles round his eyes.

' Perhaps that will be the best thing to do,' said Mr. Unwin, and turned his attention again to the struggling Latinist. With a shout and a whoop the liberated boys dashed out at the side gate, some making their way to the river to paddle in its shallows or to swim in its quiet pools ; others starting up Aldbourne Hill in search of birds' nests ; while one or two less enterprising youngsters dawdled out the remainder of the afternoon at the street corner with a group of village loiterers, who, under the uncertain English sky, were content, as those loiterers of old under the Syrian blue, to ' stand all the day idle.' Matt followed his pupils into the lobby, and then stole cautiously upstairs.

He looked so unwell in school that I sent his class away, and he went to lie down.' ' 1 shouldn't wonder if he's got a touch of colic.

' He is not fit for public worship,' said the minister ; ' and happily we serve One who has said, \" I will have mercy and not sacrifice.\" But, to speak plainly, I am troubled about Matt. He has not been himself for a week past, and I fear lest he may have taught and studied too much, and may require change.' ' Change ! ' echoed Mrs. Unwin, in her thinnest tone. ' Why should he want change ? You don't want change, and you work a deal harder than he does.'"], [61, "in MATT EVADES A PRAYER-MEETING 49 ' I,' returned the minister, with his pleasant smile ; ' I am an old cart-horse, who settled down to work long ago ; but Matt is a colt hardly yet broken, and perhaps the harness his father chose for him chafes his young spirit. I too may have been wrong in urging the ministry upon him. I may have taken my own desire for the will of God.' ' No, father, no,' ventured Grace ; and for getful of Matt's talk yesterday, she continued, ' He is so gifted, he would have such power to win souls. Oh, I believe the call must come.' ' I trust so, I trust so ; but I should wish him to take counsel with a discreet and godly minister. I shall therefore send him to stay a few days with Mr. Batt, who has often kindly invited him ; thus he will get change and counsel at the same time.' The Eev.

Few people, however, could per ceive this. A shallow world, whether secular or religious, demands but little depth in its teachers ; consequently Mr. Batt was greatly esteemed amongst his brethren, and was, in fact, a sort of Dissenting bishop. ' I should have thought that you were a better judge than Mr. Batt,' said Mrs. Unwin, with some bitterness, ' knowing the boy as you do. But there \u2014 you're always putting your self in the background.'

The front door had hardly closed upon the chapel -goers when a bedroom window was opened, and Matt, no longer pale and droop ing, but with bright cheeks and sparkling eyes, put his head out and gazed around. A moment more and he set foot on the thick branches of an old pear-tree, which for generations had been trained against the house, and in a twink ling he descended to the ground.

It was a lovely evening, with the warmth of summer and the freshness of spring ; bright ness and colour and beautiful forms were all around, yet Matt heeded none of them.

But his eyes were shining no longer ; not only had they taken a vacant stare, but an owl-like film obscured them, wrinkles were at their corners, while round his mouth appeared deep lines.

As the most unlettered man might speak, it may easily be surmised how often Mr. Unwin's sense of the fitness of things was wounded ; sometimes indeed a humble brother showed a fervour in supplica tion which went to the minister's heart, but as a rule he had need of large tolerance while"], [74, "62 A BORN PLA YER CHAP. listening to the outpouring of his flock.

Mr. Unwin's own prayer was short, and taken principally from the Liturgy of the Church, which he regarded as the type and pattern of the petitions fit to be offered by man to his Maker. He turned to the old words the more gladly because he had a dis trust of his own power in unstudied speech. His distrust made the preparation of the two Sunday sermons a serious matter, and cost him many an hour of hard thought and work.

To-night the prayer-meeting was soon over, for Deacon Masters did not appear, and the omission of his always lengthy oration shortened the evening's exercise. Mr. Masters called his oration a prayer ; as a matter of fact, however, it had nothing of supplication in it, but was a didactic setting forth of what its utterer took to be ' the plan of salvation,' and was delivered as if calculated to enlighten both earth and heaven. Mr. Masters being absent, the principal speaker, after the minister, was Deacon Penny, a small dark man with a pale face and quick black eyes. Mr. Penny had formerly kept a green-grocer's shop in Dulford, but, bequeathed a sufficient income by a relative, he had quitted Dulford and business for Aldbourne and ease, contriving to fill his unlearned leisure with gardening and gossiping.

Yet he did not merit the hard name of hypocrite, being simply one of the many who, without strong religious convictions, are attracted to Nonconformity by the greater figure they can make as Dissenters than as Church men. At chapel Mr. Penny was an import ant person \u2014 at church he would have been a nobody. Now, voluble as Mr. Penny was in common talk, he had no ability in set speech ; his words to-night, therefore, were few, and the meeting came to an earlier end than usual. Brief, however, as it had been, to Grace it seemed long ; she wanted it over, that she might know whether Matt's headache had gone ; so hurrying her mother away from the handshakings and friendly babble with which the service concluded, she accompanied her quickly home.

The appetite he showed at breakfast might well have set anxiety at rest, but his friends were used to his capacity for disposing of food, and Mr. Unwin still pon dered on the necessity of change for him. Directly after breakfast Grace went into the yard to feed her fowls, and Matt strolled round the garden.

'A little change is very pleasant. I was going to ask you, sir, if I might accept Mr. Plowden's invitation to his sheep-shearing this afternoon. He asked me to stay all night, as it is a long, lonely walk home.' 'Mr. Plowden is a serious- minded man,' said Mr. Unwin thoughtfully ; ' but I am afraid that his wife is rather of a gay turn ; at any rate, she has worldly friends who lead her astray \u2014 I have even heard that at one of these festivals there was dancing.'

' Yes, you may do so ; but you must come back early in the morning, because I have planned a further outing for you. It is to Mr. Batt's. He has often invited you, and at last I have written to fix to-morrow afternoon. You are glad, my boy, I see.' At the first mention of Mr. Batt's name Matt had looked very glum, but suddenly his face lightened. ' And I am to go to Dulford to-morrow afternoon,' he murmured, as if hardly believ ing his good fortune. ' How long shall you stay ? ' asked Grace, as she gazed in perplexity at the changes of Matt's countenance. ' Probably a week, for that was the time mentioned by Mr. Batt when he gave the invitation,' said the minister. ' I want you"], [85, "MATT IS PROMISED A HOLIDAY V 73 to take counsel with him, my boy, concerning your call to the ministry. You may speak quite openly to him, and he will be a better judge in the matter than I, as having no lean ing either way. But we will talk more about this presently ; it is nearly school-time now.' As he said this Mr. Unwin went off towards the house, leaving the young people together. ' So you are to go to Dulford,' said Grace. ' How pleasant ! ' ' Pleasant !

From her babyhood she had been taught that ' beauty is"], [89, "MATT IS PROMISED A HOLIDAY V 77 vain ' ; yet, in spite of teaching, and even of conviction, she could not suppress a thrill of pleasure at each repetition of Matt's word. All day she was in a dreamy state, causing her mother to speak rather sharply several times. In a preoccupied mood, however, the thinnest-skinned mortals are somewhat im pervious to the briers of this work- a- day world, and Grace, who always met her mother's reproofs with a certain serenity, now heeded them not at all. In the afternoon she took her mending out under the great apple-tree, and here she darned and dreamed, while the hot sun above was doing his best to change the fast - fading apple-blossom to fruit. - Grace did not give a thought to Nature's great process overhead ; absorbed in meditation, she even lost count of time, until she was startled by the church clock striking four.

Her happiness did not, however, cause her to forget that where one man had climbed another might climb, and before going to bed she carefully fastened Matt's windows."], [91, "CHAPTER VI GRACE DISCOVERS AN ENDYMION Saturday was a busy day in the minister's household, none but quite necessary work being left for Sunday.

As she bent over it she saw the red on cheeks and lips, and saw the chest heave. Matt was only sleeping, then ; but why here ? Disturbed by her movement he stirred, threw up his arm, and cried, ' Belvidera, poor Belvi dera !

Probably, indeed, the Venice"], [93, "VI GRACE DISCOVERS AN ENDYMION 81 thus pictured would be a fairer one than any manager can put upon the boards. Thus had it been with Matt, and the vision and the actor who conjured it up still haunted his brain. He was seeing a dark fascinating face, was hearing a passionate voice roll forth Otway's grandiose verse, when, suddenly waking, he beheld the dim old coach-house, and Grace in her poky sun-bonnet, and heard her say, ' Matt, why are you here ?

For the usually welcome meal Matt had no appetite ; he had spoiled it, Grace decided, by his antepast. In fact, the sight of Mr. Unwin's kind undoubting face troubled him. He could not deceive, without wincing, the man he reverenced, and the old habits of truth and loyalty had a fresh struggle with his hidden passion. Nor could he indulge in a pleasure which he had been taught to consider"], [95, "GRACE DISCOVERS AN END YM ION VI 83 in the highest degree sinful without grievous qualms. But Matt's acquiescence in the dictum of the religious world \u2014 for at this time pious Churchmen as well as Dissenters held the theatre in horror \u2014 was not the fruit of conviction, it was simply the acceptance so often yielded by youth to the decision of those in whom it trusts, before the fatal spirit of questioning comes to turn the serene faith of childhood into confusion. Ill at ease, then, Matt kept his eyes for the most part on his plate, hoping that no one would be curious about the sheep-shearing, and so cause him to load his conscience with any addition to the lies already sitting pretty heavily upon it. Happily Saturday's break fast was usually a silent one ; the minister had the morrow's sermons on his mind, and his family respected his preoccupation. Mrs. Unwin, too, was strangely thoughtful. The state of her husband's best coat was this morning sadly present to her mind, and she pondered any possible way of restoring it \u2014 replacing it seemed quite out of the question.

What was to be done ? If only certain defaulting parents could be brought to pay their long owed sums ; but the law alone could compel them to do this, and Mr. Unwin had as great a horror of the law practically as theologically. ' I can't think what we shall do about your father's coat,' said Mrs. Unwin, directly the minister and Matt had left the parlour. ' It isn't fit for wearing even at home on Sundays.

As he trudged along he decided that it would be too late, after the play, to go to Mr. Batt's ; he must therefore find a bed at an inn, and present himself to the great man in time for the chapel service on the morrow.

Saturday was market-day at Dulford, but on the road Matt met very few vehicles, since, at the date of our story, farmers and dealers did not hurry away from the sociable ordinary, but showed themselves appreciative of the charms of good fellowship. To be sure, this conviviality not unfrequently caused the more persistent loiterers to have but insecure seats on horseback or in gigs, yet very seldom did any accident happen to these bemuddled men, and even sober persons were constrained to acknowledge that Providence watched over drunken folk. Matt got no lift into town, but that did not matter ; his feet carried him along easily enough, and almost too fast, since he arrived in Dulford while the inns were yet crowded, and he waited a long time ere he dared venture into one and demand a bed.

The exciting moment came at last ; the crowd pushed into the little house, each man intent on getting the best seat he could. Matt's two former visits hither had taught him how to proceed.

Not a soul, however, cared about the lack of fitness in the stage properties. People had come to see acting, and acting they did see, such as is only a memory now.

The annals of the stage record how electric was the effect of Kean's acting, how by it even veteran play-goers were moved out of them selves. Small wonder, then, that Matt should be shaken with passion, thrilled with tender ness, melted with pity. Indeed, he lost every particle of self-consciousness, and was Kent, attendant on the outraged father. When the monarch made his protest to Regan \u2014 Dear daughter, I confess that I am old, Matt clasped his hands and sucked in his breath, as if waiting the effect of the appeal, and through the remainder of the scene, as the actor delineated the first waverings of the monarch's mind until it tottered upon the brink of madness, the lad sat trembling with excitement, till at the cry \u2014 No, you unnatural hags ! he started wildly to his feet, but was pulled down again by a stolid-looking man next him."], [107, "VII KING LEAR 95 During the wild pathos of the succeeding scenes Matt might have said with Edgar \u2014 My tears begin to take his part, while later on, when, out of his madness, the king, half recognising his once spurned daughter, utters the heart-moving speech which begins \u2014 Pray, do. not mock me, Matt burst into actual sobs ; nor did he weep alone \u2014 the whole house bore him company, and not a plaudit interrupted the tearful tribute to the actor's power.

He who declared that he could see a sneer across Salisbury Plain might well spy out a demonstrative admirer in the little Dulford theatre. When, therefore, the last words of that wonderful last scene were spoken, and the great actor appeared before the curtain, his gaze rested on Matt with satisfaction. Without doubt the lad's clasped hands, his tear-stained face, his trembling lips, his absolutely adoring eyes, were to Kean more acceptable than all the shouting and cheering around. On his way out Matt found a small crowd waiting in the lobby to see the last of Kean, who must needs pass out by the common door, there being no other exit from the theatre. He came leaning on the arm of a faithful friend. His feet stumbled as they moved, his face was dull, almost lethargic. The effect of the spirits he had swallowed had passed in the fierce emotions of the play, and he now looked only the exhausted drunkard. But Matt saw nothing of this. He had' elbowed himself to the front, and stood with all his heart in his face. Kean bowed feebly in answer to"], [109, "KING LEAR VII 97 the plaudits which greeted him, hardly raising his eyes to his admirers, but before Matt he stopped and held out his hand. ' You love fine acting,' he said. ' You have been happy to-night.' ' Happy ! ' gasped Matt, not knowing if he were standing on his head or his heels. ' 0 sir, I have been in heaven.' ' In heaven, and weeping,' returned Kean, with a smile, which for a moment chased away the signs of weariness and dissipation on his face. 'Ah, I see that you are an enthusiast for my art. Have you ever thought of following it ? ' ' 0 sir, if I could ! ' cried Matt, all thought of his destined calling, of Mr. Unwin, of Grace, clean swept out of his mind. ' You have a promising face and figure,' said Kean, eyeing him critically, ' and as you can feel so intensely yourself, you ought to be able to make others feel.

Matt drew himself up to his full height, and, in his rapturous excitement, struck out his hand with unconscious force. It encoun tered the ribs of a square-shouldered, finely set man. ' What are you about, fellow ?

' Mind you,' continued the outraged officer, ' if a lout can't behave himself, he has no business amongst gentlemen.'

' Look out, Tony,' cried one friend. ' Don't be beaten by a boy,' urged the other, and Mr. Carew, with a great effort, recovered his footing. Meanwhile the people around did not attempt to separate the brawlers, most of them holding a fight to be a natural and interesting conclusion to any secular public gathering. Even the ladies present were far more excited than alarmed, and, to a woman, took the part of the fair-faced youth with the beautiful voice, red-coat though his opponent might be. But, unknown to the crowd, a man of peace had, at the beginning of the fray, run out in search of a constable, and just as Mr. Carew's friends were thinking it was high time to interfere, each, combatant was locked in the grasp of a pair of sturdy arms.

Hearing such strange words he turned sharply round, and looked askance at the speaker. He knew that Mr. Unwin had the Establish ment in great esteem, but, really, to put a phrase from the Church Service in the place of Holy Scripture was a strong measure. The"], [116, "104 A BORN PLA YER CHAP. pastor's constant use of the Liturgy in his prayers passed undetected by the deacon, since the latter, born and bred a Noncon formist, had never thought it necessary to become acquainted with the creed from which he dissented. Other faces besides the deacon's grew questioning, but the mild dignified countenance in the pulpit seemed to rebuke all carping, and no sooner had Mr. Unwin told the reason of his text than the ruffled hearers were soothed to happy attention, and the great critic, himself touched by the story, became indulgent to the teller's odd whim. In the square pew allotted to the minister's family sat Mrs. Unwin and Grace, the former more troubled than ever by thoughts of the shabby coat, and quite unable to follow its wearer in his discourse on ' The Life Ever lasting.' It would indeed have presented a puzzling question to anybody bold enough to have entertained it, how a being like Mrs. Unwin, whose every faculty was devoted to the meanest things of sense, would feel, transported to the tremendous spiritual world"], [117, "VIII DEACON PENNY'S STORY 105 her husband was telling of.

Usually the changeful countenance near it somewhat disturbed its serenity, as the wind ruffles the surface of the stillest pool ; but the owner of that countenance was in Dulford, doubtless, Grace thought, listening to more sounding speech than her father's. Ah ! she hoped that he would be humble with Mr. Batt ; would put away the satirical spirit, so unbecoming to a Christian minister ; and again she wondered if he would choose the ministry. At this point she became reproach fully conscious of how far her thoughts were wandering from the sermon. The everlasting life of the converted, the sanctified soul, even of her own, was then of less moment to her than was Matt's present well-being.

Then, too, they ate larger dinners than usual ; con sequently the afternoon was passed in a serene"], [119, "VIII DEACON PENNY'S STORY 107 state of drowsiness, a state which became one of absolute slumber if encouraged by a volume of sermons or any other approved theological work. Mr. Unwin sometimes felt, as he pre pared his evening's sermon, that he would fain have left his close little study, and have meditated ' sub Dio ' as he loved to do. But he had long been reconciled to the barriers set around him, and reverenced them much as the saintly a Kempis reverenced the cloister which separated him from the world.

Matt, remembering the pleasant Sunday walks of his boyhood, when his father was yet a parish parson, sometimes tried to beguile Grace into a short ramble.

But now the hour's sermon is over, the concluding hymn sung, and the people come trooping out of the white-washed chapel into the golden loveliness of the May. Opposite the chapel door stands a fine chestnut-tree ; it is in full bloom, and the mid-day sun strikes hotly on its silver cones and broad leaves, but beneath its branches is a dense shade. In this shade linger the two deacons, evidently awaiting their minister, Deacon Masters with his particular air of Sabbath gravity turned to amazement, and Deacon Penny with his eyes shining and his lips twitching in anticipation of the tale he has to tell.

As Mr. Unwin stepped out of chapel his thoughts were running on the last verse of the morning's final hymn \u2014 There shall I bathe my weary soul In seas of heavenly rest ; And not a wave of trouble roll Across my peaceful breast. The words present an aspect of the Life Everlasting which must always have a peculiar charm for the toilers here below, and, dwelling on it, Mr. Unwin would have passed the two men by, but Grace, who hovered near him, more dove-like than ever in the pretty gray frock and bonnet sent by her sister Rachel, noticed Mr. Penny's expectant look. ' Mr. Penny wants to speak to you, father,' she said softly. The minister stopped and gazed at Mr. Penny rather absently ; his thoughts were still more of heaven than earth. ' Yes, sir ; I've got somethin' as you ought to know,' said Mr. Penny, planting his feet firmly on the ground, and seizing the lappet"], [122, "A BORN PLAYER CHAP. 110 of his coat with one hand while the other was left free for action. ' I don't want to tell no tales on nobody, but the truth's the truth, an' we've got to tell the truth and shame the devil.

Mr. Masters listened to this prelude with a threatening frown. His colleague was trying to gloss over a grievous fault, and must presently be rebuked. To attempt to stay Mr. Penny's flow of language when he had a story to tell would be about as much good as attempting to stay the Aid when close to its confluence with the Ullen, and, as Mr. Masters had no notion of getting a word in edgeways, he bode his time. But the minister, careful of the Sabbath hours, broke in on the voluble deacon. 'Do I gather that some one in whom I"], [123, "DEACON PENNY'S STORY VIII 111 take an interest is in trouble ? ' he asked gravely. ' Take an interest ! ' exclaimed Mr. Penny. ' I should think you did. Why, he's like your own flesh an' blood ; an' for the matter o' that, we all take an interest in him, both for his own sake, for he's as likely a young man as you'll find anywhere, an' because he's one as you set store by.' At the words ' like your own flesh and blood,' the minister remembered a rumour he had once heard how Rachel's husband, on a long past convivial occasion, had been overtaken by drink. What if the tale were true, and if now there were some fresh fall ! But Grace's fears flew straight to the mark. ' 0 father ! ' she gasped, putting her hand on his arm. ' Is it Matt ? ' ' Of course it's Matt,' said Mr. Penny, with a prodigious wink of both eyes at Grace. ' Mr. Hare I should say. Who did you think I was tellin' you about ? Why, about him, to be sure.

With this the rector turned sharply into a gravel path which led between the shrub bery and the paddock, and Mr. Unwin, sadly recognising; that he was for the second time a talker's victim, meekly accompanied him.

' cried the parson, in equal surprise and alarm. ' No ; he is well, and high - spirited as ever. He was here yesterday morning. Why do you ask me such a question ? ' ' A strange and painful report has reached me,' returned Mr. Unwin. ' It says that young Mr. Carew and my ward, Matthew Hare, who certainly is staying in Dulford, had"], [136, "A BORN PLA VER CHAP. 124 last evening a quarrel and fight in the theatre there ; that Mr. Carew was carried to his inn sadly injured, while Matthew Hare was seized by the constables and locked up.' ' Ha, ha, ha,' laughed Dr. Beauchamp, his face o-rowing crimson with scorn. 'What ! one of the finest young men in the army worsted by a slip of a lad like yours \u2014 a fine lad, too, but neither a boxer nor a fencer I should say. Why, my good sir, the tale carries a lie on the very face of it. Besides, the Carews were at church this morning, Mrs. Carew as handsome and serene as ever ; so there's no bad news of Tony, you may be sure, for he's the apple of her eye, Mr. Unwin, the apple of her eye. But come, from whom did you hear this absurd story ? ' 'From Mr. Penny.' ' Exactly. I thought it had come from some prating fool, and so it has \u2014 from the biggest liar in the parish,' cried the parson hotly. ' You must excuse me, Mr. Unwin, if I call one of your flock by such a hard name, but indeed he merits it.

' Impossible ? I should have thought it was just what he would like. A fine forward lad he is. He told me he had as good a right in Thorndon Wood as I. Ha, ha !' ' God forbid that he should enter a theatre! ' ejaculated Mr. Unwin fervently. 'For if he has done so, he has not only broken a rule of our body, but has practised a cruel deceit.' ' Come, Mr. Unwin,' remonstrated the rector, ' you must not be hard on the lad. You Non conformists are too strait with your boys and"], [138, "126 A BORN PLA YER CHAP. girls. Why, why ! young blood will bubble up now and then, in spite of all your cooling regimen. Indeed, sir, I am not sure but that you make it boil by the very measures that you take to chill it. And, after all, where is the harm in going to see a fine actor ? ' ' Sir, one of your own clergy \u2014 I refer to the learned Jeremy Collier \u2014 drew up such an in dictment of the English stage as might well cause all thinking persons to condemn its repre sentations ; and another clergyman \u2014 the saintly William Law \u2014 -has thus written \u2014 \"The play house is as certainly the house of the devil as the church is the house of God.\" ' ' Well, well ; things were bad in Collier's time, and in Law's not much better. Con greve's and Wycherly's plays were the fashion ; loose morality \u2014 very loose. I have heard them myself \u2014 not that they did me any harm.' Here the rector's lips took a decorous pucker. ' But the fashion has changed, and this Kean plays Shakspere. Now, surely you, as a man of reading, will admit that Shakspere has some fine thing's. ' Dr. Beauchamp must needs speak as the"], [139, "AT THE RECTORY IX 127 world was beginning to speak, though, in truth, he cared little for the Shaksperian drama, since, like the late monarch, he had a great leaning to romantic comedy, and pre ferred The Rivals to any other play. ' I admit it,' returned the minister, sorely tried between scholarly candour and theo logical restraint. ' Shakspere's plays abound with noble thoughts, set in perfect words ; but, on the other hand, there is so much in them the Christian must eschew, that I should not commend them to my ward as reading, still less should I permit him to be present at their representation.' , ' Ah, Mr. Unwin, Mr. Unwin,' cried the parson, shaking his head, ' you may try to turn men and women into angels, but you'll only make them hypocrites. However, we shall not agree on this subject. Still, if you are a wise man, you'll take my advice \u2014 you will probably drive into Dulford this afternoon and hunt out your ward \u2014 don't be hard on him supposing he has so far transgressed as to go to the theatre.' ' I could not be hard on him, whatever he"], [140, "128 A BORN PLA VER CHAP. has done,' said Mr. Unwin. ' And with respect to seeking him out, it is what I purpose to do, since you can throw no light on Mr. Penny's story. I will therefore see about it forthwith, and will bid you good morning, sir, with many thanks for your courtesy.' ' Come, come, there can be no hurry, and you wdll do me a favour if you will stay and take lunch with me.' But Mr. Unwin, gratified as he was by the invitation, was too bent on immediate action to linger, so the parson accompanied his visitor down the carriage drive, and bade him ' good morning ' at the gate. Perhaps, clear reader, you are shocked at Dr. Beauchamp's unclerical ways and sentiments, and are ready to compare him with your pet clergyman, greatly to his disadvantage. But the Aldbourne folk, except such as were bitten with Methodism, were very well satisfied with a parson who lived like one of themselves, whom they could understand and who under stood them ; and, after all, they were not so much in the wrong as, at first sight, may appear. Dr. Beauchamp had, it is true, no"], [141, "AT THE RECTORY IX 129 conception of the duties of a priest, but he took a daily interest in the well-being of his people, their crops, their cattle, their children. He gave little or nothing to beautify the church's structure, but his purse was ever open to the sick and needy. He did not trouble about having things ecclesiastical done decently and in order, but he troubled a good deal that his parishioners should lead decent lives. He had no Sunday School, but he saw that the Church Catechism was taught to the youngsters both of the Free and Dame Schools, and kept a sharp look-out as to the practice of its pre cepts, especially of those which inculcate obedience and respect to parents and betters. He certainly never preached a sermon on Apostolical Succession, or the Efficacy of the Sacraments, or the verbal inspiration of Scrip ture, but he had in his sermon-pile, which he went regularly through, some very incisive little homilies on a man's duties to his nei^h bour ; and, in fine, Aldbourne under his care might compare favourably, both in manners and morals, with many a rural parish of to-day.

For the loan of a horse and cart he must look to a friend, and that friend must be Mr. Masters, for though the deacon would no doubt frown on the request, he would be very angry if it were made to another, and would probably end by complying with it. Leaving the Rectory, Mr. Unwin re traced his steps to the corner -of the street where stood the grocer's shop, and there, in the private door-way, he beheld the good man dusting his boots with a handkerchief.

He was really touched by the Scriptural allusion, but he was yet more moved by the prospect of an opportunity, during the drive home, of speaking his mind to Matthew Hare. ' I hope as the young man'll profit by your goodness to him,' he continued, ' an' leave off all his light ways.

Mr. Unwin had clone two bold deeds. Though keenly sensitive to his anomalous position in clerical eyes, he had sought an in terview with Dr. Beauchamp ; and though shrinking from any war of words, he had asked an extraordinary favour of Mr. Masters. Yet at the door of his own parlour he paused, foreboding the reproof he would meet within. How often our nearest, if not our dearest, make all the dread of our lives. As her husband entered, Mrs. Unwin lifted up a face whereon sat an air of martyr-like"], [145, "MATT'S RETURN X 133 resignation. To wait, hungry, before the food one is determined not to touch until a loiterer arrives, has never been found improving to the temper; and in Mrs. Un win's case the trial was the greater because this delay caused all the needful household work to stand still. ' Well, William,' said the uneasy house keeper, ' you've forgotten dinner, I should think, and on the Sabbath too, when it's so important to have everything to time. There's Kezia has her own meal to get, and to make thino-s straight before she can clean herself and be off to Bible Class. Men somehow never do think \u2014 but, there, I should have supposed that your own stomach would have told you the time, especially after the praying and preach ing you have done.' ' I am sorry to be late,' said the minister, ' but, as Grace has no doubt told you, a matter of more importance even than dinner demanded my attention.' ' Could Dr. Beauchamp tell you anything ? ' asked Grace, whose anxiety had ill endured delay."], [146, "A BORN PLA VER CHAP. 134 ' No, my dear, he knew nothing, and as the squire's family were at church this morning, he inferred that the story was greatly exagger ated, if not wholly false.' 'Well, I wonder you should take any notice of it at all,' said Mrs. Unwin, as, forgetting her own hunger, she carefully attended to her husband's wants. ' I don't believe a word of it. Why, Mr. Penny said \u2014 so Grace tells me \u2014 that Matt was at the play three nights running, and how can that be true when he was in bed one night with a sick headache and up at Mr. Plowden's the other ?

You'll have everybody"], [147, "MATT'S RETURN X 135 up in arms,' cried his wife, much perturbed. Mrs. Unwin's belief in her husband was absolute, and she questioned his words and deeds, not because she doubted the wisdom of either, but because to her a grievance was a distinct form of pleasure. ' Not that they've any right to interfere with you,' she continued, ' giving a man of your learning and years such a miserable salary.' ' Hark ! I hear the cart,' exclaimed Grace, as through the Sunday silence without came the sound of a quick trot with wheel accompani ment. But surely the deacon's old mare and lum bering cart never went at so brisk a pace, and yet the sounds ceased opposite the house. Grace rose and peeped cautiously through the open hall door. If Mr. Masters saw her he would expect her to come forward and speak to him. Her cautious glance was, however, suc ceeded by a sudden rush to the door, for in the entry stood Matt. ' Ah ! you are not hurt,' she cried, holding out her hand, while he, pale and reluctant, hesitated upon the threshold of his home."], [148, "136 A BORN PLA VER CHAP. ' No, I am not hurt,' he replied, squeezing her fingers hard. ' Hurt . No indeed,' said a gentleman who had followed Matt to the door. ' This is a fine fighting cock, and more likely to hurt another than to get hurt himself.' Grace dropped the hand she held, and looked at the speaker. In her delight at see ing Matt she had not noticed his companion, but now she immediately recognised him as Mr. Anthony Carew. The soldier, if not a handsome, was a per sonable young man, with a fair sun-burnt face, a fine figure, and an exceedingly self-assured manner. He was well - bred, healthy, and ignorant, according to the fashion of the English country gentleman, who lives in the open air and never reads. Though already known as one of the hardest drinkers in his regiment, and though in a state of semi-intoxi cation last night, Mr. Carew looked as fresh as a rose. But our forefathers could, with im punity, drink draughts which would inevitably send us out of the world, whereby we judge that, either these men were tougher than"], [149, "X MATT'S RETURN 137 we, or that they drank better liquor than ours. ' Excuse me, Miss Unwin,' continued Mr. Carew, with the dainty accent and in the drawling fashion peculiar to him, which to gether rendered him famous among the vil lagers for his 'fine talk.' ' Excuse me, but I see you have heard the story of our little \u2014 ah \u2014 encounter last night. Well, mind you, this young fellow can hit out straight ; he ought to be a soldier. Can't you persuade your father to put him in the army ? ' While Mr. Carew talked on, trying in his good-natured way to cover Matt's confusion, the minister came out into the hall. Matt stepped quickly forward, and looked in his guardian's face. At a glance he saw that Mr. Penny had been before him, and he stood dumb. But a sterner judge than Mr. Unwin could scarcely have shown hardness to so evidently repentant a sinner as Matt. His face was pale, his eyes were heavy, his hair was out of curl, his whole bearing expressed remorse. ' My boy,' said the minister, his voice"], [150, "138 A BORN PLA VER CHAr. trembling a little, ' I was just coming in search of you. Welcome back.' Through the slow hours he had spent in the round-house, and during his rapid drive to Aldbourne, behind Mr. Carew's fast -stepping horse, Matt's one terror had been the thought of this meeting. 0 that he could avoid it in any way ! But as Mr. Penny would most certainly have told the evening's history \u2014 and with embellishments \u2014 the only course for its hero was to return home, confess himself, and take humbly the rebuke he deserved. ' 0 sir,' he said, touched to the heart by the kind greeting which had waited no word from him, ' I have done wrong ; I am sorry.' ' It is well,' replied the minister, laying a tender hand on the lad's shoulder, and holding him fast ; then turning courteously to Mr. Carew, he asked, ' Are we indebted to this gentleman for bringing you home . ' ' Yes, Mr. Unwin,' said the officer cheerily, as he came forward and shook hands. ' I slept in Dulford last night, and my first inquiries this morning were for my honour able antagonist here. I heard that he was"], [151, "X MATT'S RETURN 139 occupying a certain hermitage which we will not name. I went there, and found him fretting himself into fiddle - strings.

Ah, Mrs. Unwin, I beg your pardon ; I did not know you were so near. Are you quite well ? ' If Mr. Carew thought it a sign of good breeding to show himself dictatorial towards men, he certainly behaved to women of all ranks with courtesy, and now spying Mrs. Unwin just within the parlour door, lie interrupted himself to accost her.

' I was just on the point of starting to Dulford in search of him, since the painful story of his ' ' Excuse me, Mr. Unwin,' cried the soldier, ' that's just what I came to speak about.

I believe she's in love with him. Happy fellow ! Ay, and he needn't have been so confoundedly afraid of the old Methodist. Why, he was as soft as a woman, ay, and softer ; women can be hard enough when they choose. I wonder if he will listen to reason and put Matt Hare in the army. I shall tell him it is madness to think of making such a spirited young devil into a Methodist preacher. He would as soon knock his hearers down as look at 'em.' Almost as Mr. Carew drove away from the minister's gate Mr. Masters, with his wide cart and stolid mare, came along the street.

Reminded of her duty, Grace made herself ready, and then stole out by the yard gate without glancing at Mr. Masters, whose loud voice she could hear addressing her father. ' Then we an' the mare are saved breakin' the Sabbath,' he said stiffly. In telling of Matt's return, the minister's relief from uncer tainty had shone out too much like joy to please the stern deacon.

Perhaps the latter were the more moved, for though Matt Hare showed but little appreciation of their charms, they were not equally indifferent to his. Grace generally played the part of teacher to perfection, but this afternoon she made a very indifferent pedagogue. The best -be haved girl in the class repeated ' The spacious firmament on high ' without a mistake, and gained no praise. The black sheep of the flock remarked audibly that she saw no good in ' 'ymns an' textes,' and got no rebuke. Graces thought's were away from the hot"], [157, "CHAP. XI A CONEESSION 145 vestry \u2014 where teachers and children suffered every Sunday in the summer a grilling almost equal to that of St. Lawrence \u2014 and up in her father's study. There, doubtless, Matt was now making his confession. Notwithstanding her absorption, Grace was quite aware of the curious glances cast upon her. Matt's escapade had of course gone the round of the congregation, and everybody was longing to talk about it. Directly school was over she would be surrounded by ruthless questioners. The prospect was unbearable ; the most undignified retreat would be better than such torture. At the last word of the concluding prayer, therefore, Grace slipped to the vestry door, and was down the aisle and out of the chapel in a twinkling, when, taking to her heels, regardless of sex or Sabbath, she ran through the wharf, as the less frequented way, and in a few minutes gained the welcome shelter of home. Within the house was a great calm. Grace peeped into the parlour ; it was empty. She went upstairs ; the bedroom doors stood open, there was no creature in them. She stole L"], [158, "146 A BORN PLA YER CHAP. down again, and out into the dark school lobby. Now she could hear voices above ; Matt's low and broken, her father's soft and soothing. Almost immediately the voices ceased, the study door opened, Matt's foot was on the stairs. The very sound of his quiet springless step told Grace his state of mind. Usually he ran up and down, two stairs at a time, as if his legs could not keep pace with his impatience. Catching sight of Grace he tried to smile, failed dismally, then came up to her and put his hand on her arm. She looked very pretty, standing there in her pale gray gown, her cheeks flushed by her run, her eyes brimful of tenderness. Matt's heart went out to her, not so much to the prettiness as to the tenderness. He was in such need of sympathy that, had Mrs. Unwin stood there with a motherly expression on her face, he would probably have given her the kiss he now gave her daughter. But the effect on each would have been different. As it was, no sooner did his lips touch Grace's soft cheek than he was conscious of a strange thrill, while she had such a"], [159, "XI A CONFESSION 147 rush of feeling that, for a minute, she was like to faint. ' Let us go into the garden,' said Matt, recovering himself, ' and I will tell you every thing.' So they two went up the long gravel wralk to the old summer-house, which stood under the shade of a laburnum. A week ago this tree had been the pride of the garden, but now its flowers were scattered on the ground, making a yellow carpet. ' Your father has been good to me,' said Matt, as they sat down on the shaky seat. ' Did you tell him everything ? ' asked Grace. ' Everything,' he returned, and then sat silent, as if in remorseful thought. Grace had plenty of patience, and would have waited her companion's pleasure, but time was going fast, the call to tea would soon come, and afterwards was the chapel service. ' Matt,' she said softly, ' it is long past four o'clock.' 'Is it ? ' said Matt, lifting his heavy eyes to Grace with a sickly smile.

' At the remembrance of Grace's midnight burglar Matt burst into an involuntary laugh, but it soon ended in a sigh. ' The beginning was years ago,' he said ; ' when I was quite a child. At the top of our house we had a garret, where were piled up heaps of old books \u2014 sermons, novels, plays. I always loved reading, and I used to hunt among these. Presently I chanced on the plays. They delighted me. I read them over and over again, until I got many of them by heart. 1 can repeat some of them now : Fazio, for instance, and Bertram. At home I never heard a word about actors or acting, but when I went to school I found a boy there who had often been to the play. He talked to me of Shakspere \u2014 until then I had supposed Shakspere to be an epic poet, for I knew him only by extracts in school-books \u2014 but I remembered that, in my father's library, were volumes marked with his name.

But once, I re member, we had the schoolroom to ourselves, and thought it a fine opportunity to practice the fencing scene in Richard III.

Here Matt paused, his eyes glowing with such a light as showed the fire within to be by no means extinguished ; and when he continued, his voice was oddly moved. ' Last autumn the old craze was brought back to my mind in a strange way. You know I went to Richmond, to stay with my Uncle Morris. While I was there, a com pany of actors came down to the theatre to perform Bertram. A play-bill was sent to my uncle. On it was the name of my old school-fellow, Bob Garnett, opposite the title part. I had no notion that he had gone on the stage, and ' ' What ! Is he an actor ? ' cried Grace, in horror. ' Yes, an actor ; and the desire to see him act was too strong for me. I accompanied my cousins to the theatre.' ' 0 Matt, what a pity !

' But you were sick on Thursday ; I can't think how you went to Dulford.' ' Sick with longing,' he said impulsively, ' so I shammed sick in reality.

The sight of her mother's tears made Grace feel as guilty as if she herself had wrought all the wrong, but it stirred up Matt's bile. He would a thousand times rather she had scolded him vigorously than have wept at him. He decided, with some scorn, that a mixture of tea and tears must be appetising, for Mrs. Unwin's weeping did not spoil her meal. Like the Psalmist, she ' ate the bread of tears, and had plenteousness of tears to drink.' The young folks would have been glad enough when tea came to an end, but beneath this deep was another, deeper still \u2014 the chapel service. With a brave outside and a shrink ing heart, Matt anticipated the ordeal, while Grace was quite as agitated as he, and, more over, did not hide her tremors so well.

Every head turned towards the ex pected trio, and on nearly every countenance sat reprehension. Mr. Masters, whose desk was under the pulpit and opposite the door, stopped short, book in hand, and stared at each reprovingly, as who should say, ' Bad, worse, worst.' But neither of the three noticed him. Mrs. Unwin crept up the aisle with an apologetic air, and Grace glided after her, while Matt stalked behind, his head well up, his face flushed, his eyes turned haughtily from the eyes seeking his, and fixed on the minister's pew, the partition of which wras a foot or so higher than that of any other. They reached the friendly shelter, and, sinking on the seat, they crouched into the curious posture approved by Noncon formity as devotional. When they unbent themselves Grace put out her hand to Matt, as if to assure him that she, at least, would stand beside him, and he in return warmly grasped the tender fingers.

Matt had formerly sat by Mrs. Unwin, sideways to the people, but the view of men and women singing was too great a temptation to him, since he felt impelled to mimic the various expressions, mostly dolorous, induced by the making of melody. Mr. Masters could only see Matt's face by turning himself quite round, and then he only beheld it in profile, but the congregation noted the deacon's stern glances, and knew that a pretty rod was in pickle for Master Matt. The privilege of selecting the hymn before the sermon was reserved by Mr. Unwin, the other hymns were left to the deacon. To night he had given out a hymn of the fire-and brimstone type, ' Stop, poor Sinner,' and, as his knowledge of harmony was nil, he sang the tune in a blatant tenor voice, gazing the while, with his most uncompromising ex pression, at the offending youth.

The people listened intently to both prayer and sermon. Surely the minister would not throw aw7ay such an opportunity of speaking plainly upon the sin of theatre-going. But they listened in vain. Mr. Unwin's prayer was for the charity that hopeth all things, and his sermon only an enlarging upon \u2014 we had almost said an enfeebling of \u2014 St. Paul's splendid eulogium of the same virtue.

' All the members know of his fault, an' it's my opinion as he should be rebuked before 'em all.'

Harshness, or even argument, would probably ruin him ; gentleness may win him, for kindness has more power over souls, not only than severity, but than the very best reasoning. And I firmly believe that at the tribunal of the God whose name is Love, it will be easier to give account for having been too gentle than for having been too severe.' While the minister thus fought Matt's battle with the chapel censor the offending youth and Grace had reached home. ' We have escaped them all,' said Grace, as they entered the garden gate.

Every line of Mr. Penny's face and figure was apologetic, and most of all apolo getic was his silence. The man so eager to speak had changed into the man repentant for having spoken.

' But look here, Mr. Penny, before I promise to keep your secret, tell me honestly, did you enjoy the play last night ?' Mr Penny gave his questioner a shrewd glance, and saw that he might answer truly. ' Enjoy it ! I should think I did,' he said, sucking in his breath.

'I will keep your, secret,' said Matt, his face all aglow, and, giving Mr. Penny a M"], [174, "162 A BORN PLA VER CHAP. hearty shake of the hand, he went off after Grace. His conversation with Deacon Masters ended, the minister went home, sadly dwelling on Matt's fall and its consequences. The lad must be defended from any inquisition on the part of the congregation, lest the shame and sorrow he now felt should be turned to anger and defiance. Mr. Unwin sighed as he recog nised what manner of spirit Matt was of, and yet so ardent a nature, if only taking the right course, might act as an inspiration to many, and be a power in the Church. Well then, the first thing was to guard him from attack, not only abroad but at home. Here again the minister sighed. However patiently he bore with his wife's tongue, he could not be ignorant of its effect on others, especially on Matt ; and now, unless he could by tactful reasoning win her to silence, how often would the lad's delinquencies rise in judgment against him !

Involuntarily Mr. Unwdn thought of the continual dropping that weareth away stones, and winced as he felt how unlike a stone was the young heart he desired to shield. But our dread of an impending disagreeable is often greater than needs be, as the minister presently found, for no sooner had he touched upon the deacon's suggestion that Matt should be brought up before the Church than all Mrs. Unwin's spirit was aroused. She could suffer impertinences from the members of her husband's flock so long as these affected only herself, but as the hen, which runs away or crouches when herself attacked, will turn and face any foe in defence of her brood, so Mrs. Unwin turned to defend Matt.

' Well, I wonder at Mr. Masters wanting you to copy the Wesleyans when he thinks they are all wrong. But I hope, William, you'll be firm. If you have a fault it is that you are too easily put upon.'

Many an hour had he sat up conning plays instead of lying down to sleep, but always undiscovered. Doubtless Mrs. Unwin would soon have found him out had he not been crafty enough to buy candles for this secret use, and so spare those of the household. His determination taken, he, on Wednesday afternoon, manfully set himself to carry it out. The half-holiday gave him plenty of time to make his preparations, and he was busily employed in the garden from the end of"], [179, "AN AUTO-DA-FE CHAr. XIII 167 dinner until four o'clock, at which hour he came, with a half-gloomy, half-important manner, to invite Mrs. Unwin and Grace to see the lighting of the bonfire. Both women were eager for the sight, both looking on it, not only as a burning of the accursed thing, but as a sign and seal of Matt's renunciation of worldly amusements. Mrs. Unwin was certainly amazed to find Matt in possession of so large a stock of play-books, but the knowledge of their quick coming destruction deadened her horror. So she and Grace, simple souls, accepted the burnt -offering in good faith, and did not perceive that Matt was finding a species of satisfaction in being chief and only actor in quite a little tragedy. The weather was still fair ; the sun shone brightly ; here and there a tiny white cloud sailed over the blue ; the wind was a soft south. It was a day for young hearts to rejoice in their youth and the youth of the summer, and not to be preparing sacrifices. Leading the way, Matt stalked with a solemn stride to the top of the garden, where"], [180, "168 A BORN PLA VER CHAP. he had piled up a fine heap of dry rubbish and wood, with a wisp of straw on the side towards the sun. Seating the pair of spec tators in the arbour, he took from thence a huge bundle of pamphlets and some bound volumes, and began to put these one by one on the funeral pyre, opening each as he did so. They would set on fire more easily thus, he said, but in reality he wanted to snatch a last look at the fascinating pages. ' What do we begin with ? ' he cried, seizing a pamphlet at random. ' Cato. Only think, Grace, this play was written by the man who composed your favourite hymn \u2014 \" The Lord my Pasture shall pre pare.\" Ah well, the best may err. What is this? The Man of the World. Sir Pertinax, your \"booing\" is over. And here are The Road to Ruin and a dozen more less known to fame. 0 dear ! must f burn this one ? Fazio. Written by a parson, ma'am. Think of that.'

She does not feel, she does not feel ! Thank Heaven ! She does not feel her Fazio's last last kiss \u2014 One other ! cold as stone \u2014 sweet, sweet as roses. Then, as if ashamed of his emotion, he laid the other books silently on the pile, until he came to the bound volumes. 'Shakspere must crown the whole,' he said resolutely. ' 0 Matt ! ' exclaimed Grace, in admira tion of the sublime sacrifice, ' will you burn Shakspere ? ' ' Yes, and quick, or perhaps ' he stopped, and felt in his pocket. 'Here is the tinder-box,' said Grace eagerly. ' No base flint and steel shall light the bonfire which is to consume genius. The sun alone is worthy to kindle the flame,' cried Matt, dashing the box aside ; and taking a piece of burning-glass from his pocket he placed it over the wisp of straw. We have all read of burning-glasses which fused silver, gold, and even precious stones, but who ever heard of one being used to consume wit and"], [182, "A BORN PLAYER CHAP. 170 pathos, comedy and tragedy ? The sun prob ably found his rays oddly employed, never theless he was equal to the occasion ; in a few moments he set fire to the straw, then the rubbish caught, the dry wood followed, and soon the pamphlets were ablaze. Up to this point Matt had not faltered, but at sight of the cherished pages curling into black tinder a sudden spasm shook him. He seized a stick, as if even now he would save his long -hoarded treasures from the flames; then a grim smile came on his face, and he stirred the fire to a fiercer blaze. It might burn the books, it could not sear the memory that held their contents. An exclamation from Mrs. Unwin in terrupted his thoughts. ' Grace, who are those gentlemen with your father ? I do declare it's Dr. Beauchamp and Mr. Carew. What can they have come for? I'm glad I've a clean cap on.' So saying, the surprised woman rose in some trepidation to greet her visitors, who came slowly up the garden.

Mr. Carew bore even a braver aspect than usual. He had been walking over the manor with his father, inspecting the crops, and the glow of exercise was yet on his cheeks. Both parson and soldier paid their respects to the ladies like men of breeding, the latter following up his greeting with a well-turned compliment to Grace, but Dr. Beauchamp's attention was immediately taken by Matt, who stood motionless beside his burnt-offering, his face flushed, his eyes glowing with a sullen light. ' What are you about, Mr. Matt ? ' asked the rector, in his sharpest tones. 'Making a bonfire in May \u2014 and with books ? ' 'I am burning my play -books,' returned Matt gloomily, giving a stir to the crowning volumes, whose thick covers still resisted the flames. ' But Shakspere is tough, and won't burn.' ' What ! You dare to burn Shakspere,'"], [184, "A BORN PLAYER 172 CHAP. cried the parson, and taking the stick from Matt's hands, he poked the topmost book quite out of the fire. Though he seldom disturbed the works of the divine poet from their place in his library, none the less this burning appeared to him a species of sacrilege, and almost involuntarily he con tinued, ' Why, you young dog, you will burn the Bible next.' A miserable doubt struck Matt's heart at the words \u2014 would the burning of the Scriptures cost him as much pain as did this ? He thrust the doubt away. ' I am burning Shakspere,' he said re solutely, and therewith he kicked back the nearly rescued book into the flames \u2014 ' because there is more temptation in his pages than in the pages of all the rest of the play-books in the world.' ' Still, there was no need of an auto-da fe,' said Mr. Unwin gently. ' You might have confided the books to me, until such time as you could have possessed them with out danger.'

' cried Matt, in strong excitement, ' and never again, so long as I live, will I go to a playhouse or open a play-book.' Standing by the smouldering fire, his face pale with passion, his eyes glittering, Matt appeared to his spectators of the gentler sex as a young confessor, witnessing to the truth before the world, represented by Dr. Beau champ and Mr. Carew. The minister, how ever, was troubled ; the lad's every word and look revealed how strong a temptation had taken him, and his guardian trembled and feared.

Mrs. Unwin had not a grudging soul, but when you are obliged to stint your dearest ones in order to provide a feast for people who are nothing to you, the joys of hospitality become somewhat doubtful; no wonder, then, if the good woman suffered agonies in seeing her voracious guests devour in a twinkling food which would have sufficed her household for a fortnight.

This tent was pitched in the meadow"], [194, "182 A BORN PLAYER CHAP. beside Deacon Penny's house, a piece of turf bo carefully kept as to resemble a lawn. The minister's parlour was full of flowers and sweet odours when Matt, soon after breakfast, entered it in search of Grace. ' What ! Going so soon ? ' he cried, seeing her equipped for out-of-doors. ' Yes ; there is a great deal to do.' ' I will come and help you, on condition that I am not handed over to Sophia Penny or Rebecca Masters ; the giggling of the one is as unbearable as the stolidity of the other.

So with a fluttering heart he walked beside Grace, whose heart was beating a duet with his. The exquisite consciousness of love was with them, pervad ing the air as did the scent of the flowers they carried, and in the sweet restraint of this mutual consciousness they passed on, arriving all too quickly at the meadow. The tent was already in the hands of the more energetic workers, and these welcomed our pair with much effusion.

Miss Sophia Penny, a slim and rather pretty maiden, mounted some high steps, thereby displaying a well-made foot and ankle. You will not be shocked, decorous reader, at Miss Penny's exhibition of her best points, since you are aware that, at the time of our story, women were known to be finished off in this charming fashion, and that consequently feet and ankles were legitimate objects of vanity. Nowadays, indeed, when the dear creatures are supposed to run on castors, like an easy-chair, such a revealing of facts would argue a sad depravity.

Solid qualities is what he should seek, piety and a decent portion, for father says a poor minister is a dreadful drag on a congregation.'

Not that Grace omitted her usual kindly attentions, but the ' brethren ' might have been so many eating machines for any effect they had on her. Dinner over, they all betook themselves to chapel, where a sort of preliminary service was held ; and from thence they proceeded to Mr. Penny's meadow. The tent was so bedecked with flowers, so full of sweet smells, and dis played such a loaded board, as to present quite a striking resemblance to the \u25a0 sylvan lodge of our first parents when made ready for the entertainment of the ' affable archangel.'

Speeches from both hosts and guests followed, all much of the same pattern, for though some orators had a copious flow of language while others hum'd and ha'd painfully, the glib, no less than the stammering tongue, spoke words of little meaning. Matt, who was standing by one of the tent pillars, which he had helped Grace to decorate with pale blue iris and pale pink peonies, pretended to be lost in admiration of the flowers, that he might the better hide his scorn of the speechifying, when the voice of Mr. Masters struck his ear.

Mr. Masters began by praising the caterers of the excellent meal just eaten, then widen ing his praise, he vaunted the whole congrega tion as the most considerate, generous, and easily pleased to be found anywhere. To such a congregation a minister surely owed a great deal. Coming at this point to a dead stop, he looked down the tent and saw Matt. The sight evidently whetted the edge of his tongue, for he continued in a very cutting way \u2014 ' I'm one as had rather speak in season than out o' season, but when I'm baffled every time I try to speak in season, I shall speak out of it, as Paul tells us we are to.

The minister looked at the lad, noted his flushed face, his shining eyes, his quivering lips, his clenched hands, and, half in alarm, half in admiration, answered \u2014 ' Certainly, my boy ; we shall all gladly listen to you, and I feel sure you will say nothing you can afterwards regret.' ' You may trust me, sir,' said Matt con fidently, ' and though, when so many Fathers in Israel have spoken, I may well shrink from lifting up my voice, I am encouraged by these words of Holy Writ : \" Let no man despise thy youth.\" ' ' Ladies and gentlemen,' he began, and in his voice was now a tremor which called forth all the sympathy of his audience, ' we have been told by several speakers to-day that this"], [202, "A BORN PLAYER CHAP. 190 festival of ours is a serious occasion, and so it undoubtedly is when we look at it under certain aspects ; for instance, if we regard it as a landmark in our lives, a point at which our elders may well pause, and ask themselves whether they are omitting no opportunity to clothe their age with angel-like perfection, and we younger ones whether we are imitating our elders.

My back sliding made me doubtful as to the reality of my call, but now I think truly that the call has come, and in mingled fear and confidence I respond to it.'

Many among the audience still stared open-mouthed at the lad who had so astonished them, for though most people knew something of his readiness in ordinary talk, they never supposed it would serve him when he stood up to make a speech. Was not Mr. Penny a man full of words ? and yet no sooner did he get on his legs with intent to utter his brimming soul, than the words seemed to freeze in his throat, and he stood confessed a dumb dog. Yes, decidedly Matt had electri fied the ears that had been listening to tire some tongues for a couple of hours. His distinct utterance, his melodious voice, at the service of all emotions, few of his hearers would probably notice, but the extraordinary dash with which he spoke carried them all away. The minister himself, though expectant of fluent speech, was hardly less surprised than the rest of the company, but since even he did not recognise how much of Matt's lan guage w7as quotation, he might well wonder.

But he attempted no further words, nor did any one else care to follow Matt.

Here Matt found a fine seat for both on the pros trate trunk of an oak, which lay close to the Ullen, and the two sat down with their faces turned to the north-west, where the sun was setting. A soft mist had just received him, and from it he sent forth a red glory over the sky and the water.

They probably thought the sermon had moved me, and that I was about to testify like a hysterical Methodist ; if so, they were mistaken ; I sank down and forgot them all.

Many a one, he says, who has been in doubt, from Augustine downwards, has been determined to the religious life by such a mysterious voice.' Matt certainly had had no thought of suppression, but it is doubtful whether he had unfolded to the minister, as openly as he now did to Grace, his extreme contempt for the utterances of yesterday on the occasion of the chapel Anniversary at the neighbouring village of Stanton. ' 0 Matt ! ' said the girl, awe -struck at the tale. 'No doubt it is a call.' ' I believe so,' said Matt gravely, ' and I feel the more sure because, while they were going on with their tedious prattle to-day, I got an impulse to speak. I did not hear the voice again, but the power of it was with me, and when Mr. Masters threw those reflections upon the minister, I could hold myself back no longer \u2014 and, Grace, I do not think I lacked either matter or words.'

' I believe that you were born to be a preacher.' As Grace uttered the words, a tricksy spirit whispered in Matt's ear Farmer Dixon's speech \u2014 ' Lad, you're a born actor.' But the remem brance was to him, in his present mood, an evident temptation of the devil ; he thrust it away, and said gravely \u2014 \u25a0 ' My father always hoped that I should be a preacher.' 'You will be,' said Grace, with absolute confidence, ' a great preacher.' ' You are a dear little prophet,' said Matt, leaning forward that he might look into her eyes.

Just at the feet of our pair was a still pool of water, divided from the rush of the river by a little island set with willows, and now when the sun had sunk, the edges of the pool be came dark, while yet in the centre shone that light which seems rather a mysterious emana tion from below than a reflection of the sky.

At thought of the possibility Matt bestirred himself, and the two reluctantly turned their backs upon the river. Grace had divined rightly ; the guests, making short work of supper in their anxiety to reach home at what they considered a Christian hour, had emptied the dishes and departed. The minister was sitting in the best parlour, his white hair shining in the dim light, his whole aspect full of peace, and beside him, strange to say, was his wife. That Mrs. Unwin should sit with her hands before her was a thing no creature had ever yet seen. Why was she not helping Kezia to clear away the supper things, and casting rueful glances at the bare dishes ? ' Ah, Grace and Matt, I'm glad you have come,' she said cheerily, rising as the young folks entered. ' I wanted you to come ; I have something to show you \u2014 something very pretty.' Here Mrs. Unwin dived into her"], [214, "A BORN PLAYER CHAP. 202 pocket. ' We must have a light to see it by,' she said. Wondering much what the pretty thing might be, Grace fetched a candle. ' God send us the light of heaven,' mur mured Mr. Unwin, as was usual with him at the evening lighting. But Mrs. Unwin's thoughts were set on a thing of earth. ' Look,' she said, putting into Grace's hand a slip of thin paper. Matt bent over Grace to see it too. ' A ten-pound note ! ' he cried. ' Yes, a ten - pound note ! ' echoed Mrs. Unwin. ' It's a present from Mr. Plowden. He gave it to your father after chapel this evening ; good kind man, and he a Church man too. It's more than any one of our own people has done all these years.' ' They have not the means,' said the minister, ' while Mr. Plowden is a prosperous man. Nevertheless his gift is as generous as it is welcome.' Mr. Plowden was, as Mr. Unwin has just said, a Churchman, but a very broad one, of"], [215, "XV IN THE WHARF 203 whom there were many at this period \u2014 unbiassed people, who went to church in the morning and to chapel in the evening \u2014 devil dodgers, as they were coarsely called, who were determined to be right one way or another.

' This is a memorable day for both of us,' said the minister to his wife. 'A day on which God has sent us both our heart's desire ; to you, money for the clothing and warming of your household ; to me, the certainty of this boy's call to the ministry.' Matt grasped his guardian's hand, and with his disengaged arm encircled Grace, and drew her towards her father, saying, in a much moved voice, ' I also have my heart's desire. Grace has promised to be my wife.' ' Little Grace ! ' cried the minister, exceed ingly surprised. ' Why, she is only a child.'

I suppose I have been blind to what was going on under my eyes.' ' Yes, indeed, you have, William,' said his wife.

The minister here went dead against the practice of most Nonconformists, who are used to set young men preaching long ere they have cut their wisdom teeth. One day, just before his departure from Aldbourne, Matt, finding Grace too busy to accompany him, started off on a solitary walk. Passing through the village, by the church and the mill, he took the road towards the parson's glebe, called Poppy Farm, which, as we know, was in the occupation of Mr. Dixon. Beside this road the little Aid flows for a space, and in its limpid waters you may now and then see a silver trout proudly parading his pink spots. Matt did not, however, loiter by the brook, but turned up Green Lane, a gentle ascent between certain fields belonging to Poppy Farm, which joins the Deercourt Road half-way up Aldbourne Hill. Green Lane merits its title ; it is green above and green below, high hedge - rows close it in, trees over-arch it, while grass grows on each side of the way. Matt went slowly up the"], [220, "208 A BORN PLAYER CHAP. lane, stopping here and there to gather a sad coloured scabious or a blue harebell, the only wild flowers left now ; or, where the tall trees ceased for a space, to pluck a blackberry from the great bunches of fruit which hung over the hedge. But of these only one in a bunch was yet black, and that was sour ; so after a few wry faces Matt turned his attention to the hazel-trees, which grew thickly in places, and pulled down a few nuts. They were not more satisfactory than the blackberries, having kernels like small peas enclosed in fine casings of pith. Matt gave up his fruit-gathering in disgust, and, arrived at the point where Green Lane joins the Deercourt Road, he sat down on a plough that had been left beside the way, and through a break in the hedge looked at the view. At the foot of the slope whereon he rested nestled the village amidst its trees. Eastwards flowed the Ullen towards some unseen exit between the encompassing hills. A light haze lay over the distant woods and uplands, and the whole landscape looked drowsy under the gray September sky. As yet the trees kept their dark summer foliage,"], [221, "XVI MALT'S DEPARTURE 209 only a beech or two showed a tinge of russet, and a silver birch shed a few yellow leaves upon the ground. In the spring Green Lane is a veritable concert hall for the birds, nightin gales, of course, leading the choir, but to-day not a note broke the stillness ; even a robin, who had attended Matt half way up the lane, and now peered curiously at him from the top of the hedge-row, did not trouble to sing. Matt, sitting upon the plough, was taking a farewell look at the scene he knew so well, when he was startled by the quick whirr of wings in the field behind him, followed instantly by the double report of a gun, the flight of a covey of partridges over his head, and a shower of shots around him. A moment more, and Mr. Dixon, his gun upon his shoulder, and a brace of dead birds in his hand, stepped through a gap into the lane. ' Why, young sir,' he cried, at sight of Matt, 'I might have shot you.' ' I don't feel sure that you have not done so,' said Matt, shaking a shot or two from his hat.

Before Matt could reply, a well-known figure appeared round the bend of the road from Deercourt. It was Dr. Beauchamp, with his gaiters on and a small axe in his hand. He had been giving his advice to the squire this morning anent the felling of trees in a too-crowded copse, and had used his axe to mark the doomed ones. These, you may be certain, were such weaklings as hindered the growth of their more robust brethren without benefiting their own. The parson greeted our pair pleasantly, and then looked askance at the brace of birds in Matt's hand. Mr. Dixon saw his landlord's glance, and smiled a wise smile. With all his nearness the farmer never grudged a present of game. As a sportsman he, of course, held by the game laws, but he agreed with Squire Carew that every one in the parish ought to taste game occasionally \u2014 the gentry and farmers, birds, the shopkeepers, hares, and the"], [224, "A BORN PLA VER 212 CHAP. cottagers, rabbits. But Dr. Beauchamp, though so open-handed in general, was, as his tenant knew, greedy in the matter of game. He did not indeed crave it for his own table, but for the tables of friends. Nothing pleased him better than to send a leash of birds, or a brace of pheasants to some old college crony, and every head of game supplied from Poppy Farm had a fixed destination long before it actually appeared at the Rectory. ' I've just given the young gentleman a brace of birds,' said Mr. Dixon, in a tone of great enjoyment, ' for I shouldn't wonder if, when the rest of the parish gets a bird or a rabbit, Mr. Unwin is left out.' ' Ay, ay, perhaps,' returned Dr. Beauchamp shortly. A Dissenting minister could hardly expect to dine on partridges, he thought ; then, reminded by the sight of Matt of the auto-da fe he had seen consummated \u2014 ' But you, Mr. Matt, what have you been doing lately .

' I have a call.' 'A call, a call ! ' ejaculated the little parson, jerking the words out scornfully. ' I should like to know the meaning of that expression.' Dr. Beauchamp had, at his own ordinations, professed himself truly ' called ' to the offices of both deacon and priest ; but a call to the minis try of the Established Church signified too often only the fact of a vacant family living, and Dr. Beauchamp might well be quite in the dark as to the meaning the word had for Matt."], [226, "A BORN PLAYER 214 CHAr.

Nothing of any importance happened to her, except the coming of Matt's letters, which, however, wrere like angels' visits, few and far between. At this period postage was heavy, and sweethearts in far easier circumstances than our pair had to be contented with hearing but seldom from one another.

' cried the traveller, dashing up to the figure, and seizing both its hands.

' I can't see you in your out-of-doors gear,' said Matt, beginning to untie Grace's bonnet, and to unpin her shawl. ' \" Off, off, you lend ings.

And indeed in her new gown and large white collar, the happiness at her heart beaming from her countenance, Grace might have appeared pretty in other eyes than Matt's. ' But you are pale and thin,' she said, when the strange sweet shyness she felt had worn off. ' You do not look so well as when you went away.' Grace's opinion was presently endorsed both by her mother and father, the former attributing Matt's wan looks to town food and town air, the latter to close study and to the oncoming of man's responsibilities. After a short time, however, his guardian began to"], [231, "MATT'S FIRST SERMON XVII 219 fear that there must be something more. Not only was the lad pale and thin, but his happy frankness of manner had given place to a strained cheerfulness, and over the sunshine of his face too often came a cloud. Mr. Unwin questioned him affectionately as to his liking for his new life, and Matt expressed entire contentment therewith ; still, the minister was not satisfied ; somehow he did not seem able to reach the heart, once so responsive to his touch. According to wont, he kept his uneasiness within his own breast, and took comfort when he saw that Grace was quite untroubled by any anxieties. In truth, when alone with Grace, much of Matt's constraint vanished, and as he sought her society more persistently than ever, and, wdien in it, showed himself a very tender lover, she might well think lightly of any change either in his manner or appearance. One day, when the holidays were about a week old, Mr. Unwin was cheered by a letter from the President of Matt's College, wherein the learned writer commended the lad's ap-"], [232, "220 A BORN PLA VER CHAP. plication to work, spoke warmly of his personal qualities, and mentioned that the divinity tutor considered ' young Hare's gift in speech to be something quite out of the common.' 'My lad,' said the minister, when he had read the letter aloud to his little family, ' you have spoken with acceptance to town critics, you will then gratify me by speaking to our simple village-folk next Sunday evening ? ' ' I will, if you wish it, sir,' said Matt, with evident reluctance ; ' but it will be much worse to preach here than in town.' ' What ! ' cried Mrs. Unwin, in great sur prise ; ' worse to preach before friends who'll make allowance for you, than before strangers who 'ud be hard on you ? ' ' Friends have proverbially been the hardest judges of a man from the days of Job down wards. \"Save me from my friends\" has been the cry ever since then,' said Matt drily. ' Of course it is bad enough to preach before strangers, but then these strangers are my fellow-students, and if they are hard on me, I have the right to be equally hard on them, for, as you know, we criticise one another's"], [233, "XVII MATE'S FIRST SERMON 221 sermons. Consequently, however feeble my attempts may be, I am comforted by the certainty of hearing plenty more quite as feeble. Thus in the multitude of mediocrities is safety.' ' But there is the divinity tutor,' said Grace, in quite an awe-struck voice, ' and you told us that he summed up each sermon.' ' And who knows better than he the extreme difficulty of speaking even moderately well ? ' returned Matt, with much animation. ' I wTould far rather have him for my audience than the Aldbourne congregation. You see, sir,' he continued, turning to Mr. Unwin, ' the very fact of caring so much to please must lay a weight on a man, and prevent him from rising out of himself, as he should do in preaching.' ' Then, my lad,' said Mr. Unwin reverently, ' it wfll be best in preaching to care only to please the Great Judge, who will accept the weakest effort made with a single eye to His glory.' ' You are right, sir,' returned Matt humbly ; 'and I will try to feel as you say.'"], [234, "A BORN PLA VER 222 CHAP. Alone with Grace, later in the day, Matt recurred to his dread. ' Fancy standing up in that pulpit,' he said, visibly wincing, ' with all those well-known eyes staring, and all those well-known mouths gaping at me, as I have so often seen them at your father. 0 dear ! I believe I shall either laugh at them or turn tail and run away.' ' But, Matt,' returned Grace wonderingly, 'you used to say how fine it would be to preach in Aldbourne chapel.' ' My tongue was too fool-hardy then.' Notwithstanding his shrinking from the ordeal before him, Matt bore himself bravely enough through the week, and even on Sunday evening, when he walked with Mr. Unwin to chapel, he had such an air of confidence that not a creature could have supposed his heart in his body to be no bigger than a pin's head. Too soon the dreaded moment came. The youthful preacher mounted the pulpit, and after a short prayer gave out his text \u2014 ' The world by wisdom knew not God.' Every eye was fixed eagerly upon him, as"], [235, "XVII MATT'S FIRST SERMON 223 lie felt to his inmost soul, though he gazed all the while at the open page of the Bible. His face grew crimson, and then became deadly pale. Mrs. Unwin, who watched him anxiously from a side seat, thought he was going to faint, but he recovered himself, and in a voice only slightly disturbed, proceeded to divide the coming discourse into heads. Here he got along quite fluently, and, taking up his first division \u2014 the world \u2014 he was about to picture the state of things in the first year of Our Lord, when all of a sudden his mind became an utter blank. He mechanically repeated his last words. He looked wildly at his tiny paper of notes, hoping it would give him help. All it said was \u2014 ' condition of heathen world at coming of Christ.' He sought in his memory for the facts he knew so well : not one could he recall. For what seemed to him an age, but was really only about a couple of minutes, he stood, his knees shaking under him, while the congregation stared at him in open-eyed amazement. Covering his face with his hands he gasped out \u2014 '01 have lost all my ideas ! ' \u2014 and"], [236, "224 A BORN PLA VER CHAP. then he sat down in the pulpit, which was tall enough to hide him completely from view. In the merciful shelter he heard, as in a half dream, the minister's voice speaking apologetic words ; there was something about youth and inexperience, but what, he was too bewildered to understand. He heard the people moving away, and did not know how full of sympathy and of hopeful prophecies were many of them. ' He'll make a fine preacher yet ; so don't you fret, ma'am, an' don't you fret, miss,' said Dame Brooke confidently, to Mrs. Unwin and Grace, the former of whom was weeping pathetically, while the latter stood beside her pale and dumb. ' He do speak out well, so as 'tis a pleasure to hear,' continued the consoler ; ' an' in especial when you're gettin' a leetle dunny \u2014 an' 0 mercy ! what a well favoured young gentleman ! ' When there was a hush in the chapel Matt came quickly from the pulpit, and entered the vestry, where, stern as fate, stood Deacon Masters. ' Well, young sir,' he said, iii his steeliest"], [237, "MATT'S FIRST SERMON XVII 225 tones, ' so you haven't turned out such a orator as we expected. I hope, I'm sure, as the poor set out you've made '11 teach you humility.' Matt gasped ; his throat wTas dry ; he could not utter a word, but his eyes darted an angry glance at his tormentor. 'Who 'ud have thought 0' the eloquent Mr. Hare, as we've heard of preaching to the quality in town, a-makin' such a figure before a poor village congregation ? ' continued the deacon, who, unlike many censors, loved to find fault with a mute offender. ' 'Tis a proof as this worldly learnin' is jest nothin' at all ; it only serves to puff folks up, an' make them think themselves summat when they're nought. What's wanted, young man, is grace \u2014 grace.' ' Matt, my boy,' said the minister, coming into the vestry, and perceiving the state of matters between Matt and the deacon, ' you will not be cast down by this sudden nervous seizure.

XVII grasped his hand, and then, turning to Mr. Masters with a haughtiness which sat oddly on his graceful person, said \u2014 ' I shall preach next Sabbath evening.'"], [239, "CHAPTER XVIII matt's second sermon Defiance often, especially in youth, furnishes an incentive to action which no other passion has been able to supply. Thus it affected Matt, making him actually long for the coming of the moment he had beforetime dreaded, and giving him an assurance that he would speak so as to silence all carping. As the important hour drew near he became a little restless, but he never faltered in his resolve, and presently he boldly mounted the pulpit stairs, and gave out his last Sunday's text. At sound of it Grace trembled, while the congregation and the minister, though admiring the lad's courage, feared lest the same train of thought should end in the same dispersion of ideas. Their fears were height ened when they heard him divide his text in"], [240, "228 A BORN PLA VER CHAP. precisely the same way as before, and again take for description its first division. After a few moments, however, fear was turned to admiration. The young preacher handled his subject in quite a masterly fashion, painting in gloomy colours a picture of 'the world.' His shades were certainly too dark ; his relief too little ; he was besides guilty of anachron isms, introducing the abomination of the circus and the orgies of later emperors into the reign of Augustus ; but thus he made all the more impression ; and when, passing from shadow to blackness, he enlarged on St. Paul's tremendous indictment of the heathen world, he made the simple folks before him turn cold at view of a corruption so flagrant, so universal. With the second part of his text \u2014 ' The wisdom of the world ' \u2014 he seemed delightfully at home. In simple and interesting language he told his unlearned hearers about the grand literature of the Greeks \u2014 about poets, his torians, philosophers ; ending with a eulogium of him whose conceptions of the soul and of wisdom were on a level with those of Scripture itself. He then spoke of the art which"], [241, "MATT'S SECOND SERMON XVIII 229 accompanied this literature \u2014 of the painting, the sculpture, the building \u2014 as unsurpassed and unsurpassable. He now went on to tell how the letters and arts of Greece became the study and the model of Rome. ' And yet,' he cried, ' we have seen that all this learning, all this art, all this admiration for noble and beautiful things, all this appreciation of the sage's wisdom, the worker's skill, did not save Roman society from corruption.' Matt's train of thought led naturally to the third division of his text \u2014 to Him who, hidden from the knowledge of the world, was yet its only salvation ; and in words so heart-moving did the young preacher speak of the God and Father of all, as to bring tears to many eyes, and to fill the minister's breast with a holy joy. Almost for the first time during his sermon Matt, sensible of the effect he was producing, looked steadily at his congregation. As he did so there flashed into his mind the remem brance of another weeping audience, and of a storm-tossed old man who cried in a pathetic voice \u2014 Be your tears wet ? yes, faith. I pray, weep not."], [242, "230 A BORN PLAYER CHAP. Even as it came, Matt drove the memory away, and the pause he made was so slight, it only added force to his peroration, which was an appeal to his hearers to choose the heavenly wisdom. The sermon over, he hurried down the pul pit steps and into the vestry, much to the dis appointment of the people, who longed first to take a good stare at him, and then to compli ment him to his face. An emotional preacher has even in our days a strong hold over the majority of hearers ; he was at this time re garded as the angel of God. Matt having disappeared, his admirers crowded around Mr. Unwin to offer congratu lations, while Deacon Masters, turning his back upon the flutter of the congregation, stalked grimly home. ' 0 Matt,' whispered Grace, as the young preacher came out of the vestry, ' I am so happy.' ' Are you ? ' said Matt, with odd dry- ness. ' Yes, oh yes. You preached so beautifully, you made everybody cry. You can '"], [243, "XVIII MATE'S SECOND SERMON 231 ' Don't talk about it now,' said Matt, in a low voice. ' I feel used up somehow, and can't bear it.' Later in the evening, however, he had to bear some discussion of his sermon, for the minister's joy must needs find words. ' My dear lad,' he said \u2014 the usually sub dued light in his face changed to radiance \u2014 ' you have astonished us all. There can be no doubt that an excellent gift is in you. Strive, then, to bring it as near perfection as may be ; and yet always acknowledge it to be a gift, not a thing of your own achieving. And now, if you will allow me to act as your divinity tutor, I will say a word about your sermon. It was excellently thought out, and super excellently worded ; but one thing I must question, which is your view of the utterly God-forsaken state of the world before the coming of Christ. I often think there is a deep truth in Augustine's words \u2014 \" What is now called the Christian religion has existed among the ancients, and was not absent from the beesinnincr of the human race.\" : o o ' Well, I'm sure, Matt,' struck in Mrs. Un-"], [244, "A BORN PLA VER CHAP. 232 win, directly her husband's voice fell at the end of his quotation, ' you never ought to be nervous any more, preaching with such ac ceptance as you have done to-night, making everybody cry, and putting the minister quite in the shade.' Mrs. Unwin's unfailing tactlessness made her apt to proclaim unpleasant truths. We all number such candid souls among our acquaint ances. A fact is clear to themselves, then let it be made clear to others, whomsoever it may hurt. ' That is absurd, ma'am,' cried Matt, blush ing painfully. ' The minister is as far beyond me in preaching as in everything else.' ' At any rate,' said Mrs. Unwin, in a rather injured tone, ' the people talked about your sermon as if they had never heard a good one before.' ' They liked it because it was shallow,' re plied Matt readily. ' So few people can really think, and a glib talker naturally suits them.' ' Well, my boy,' said the minister, with a smile, ' you are more likely to acquire depth than I am to acquire glibness.'"], [245, "XVIII MATE'S SECOND SERMON 233 Matt evidently did not care to pursue the subject, since he turned to Grace with some anecdote of the President of his College, whom he had in much admiration. Presently, how ever, when the womenfolk had gone to bed, he drew his chair nearer the minister's, and, making a visible effort, he said \u2014 ' Sir, you are good enough to commend my preaching, but I, for my part, feel as if I could never preach again.' ' You are undergoing the reaction from a great strain,' said the minister, laying his hand on Matt's shoulder. 'You are wearied out, body and mind. Go to rest, my dear boy ; in the morning you wall take quite a different view of things.' Matt lingered. On his lips was the cry \u2014 ' I want another sort of preaching than you set before me.' He tried to muster courage to utter it, to tell how, in the midst of his sermon to-night, a remembrance had come to him, bringing with it a mighty temptation ; how on the very threshold of the ministry, he was almost irresistibly drawn back to what his hearer would consider per-"], [246, "A BORN PLAYER 234 CHAP. dition. Yet somehow, each time he attempted to speak, the words refused to come. 0 if only his guardian would help him to confes sion ! But Mr. Unwin's insight seemed to have failed him ; perhaps he was dazzled by his pupil's brilliant success ; anyway he saw nothing of the tempest in Matt's mind. The lad glanced at the face beside him, noted that it shone with a more than ordinary happiness, and gave up all thought of bringing a cloud upon it to-night. In the solitude of his own room the tempta tion came upon him with redoubled force, and for a while overpowered all his resistance. Quite delivered up to it, he paced his room, repeating with impassioned gesticulation the end of the final scene of King Lear. When he had finished, a great conflict arose within him. The battle of six months ago had to be fought all over again. At last, after much wrestling and many prayers, it seemed to him as if the devil departed from him. ' I have chosen the right,' he murmured, and, exhausted but calm, he lay down to sleep. During his stay in Aldbourne he was vexed"], [247, "XVIII MATT'S SECOND SERMON 235 with no further doubts. He preached again, and even better than before ; moreover, though again the people were greatly moved, no dis turbing remembrance came to him. Only on the eve of his departure to town a vague un easiness befell him, which, however, might very well be caused by the prospect of separation from Grace. The two were taking a farewell walk over Archer's Hill, and looking at the view, so changed from that wdiich they had seen together seven months ago. The valley everywhere was covered with water, for the heavy winter rains had caused the Ullen to overflow its banks, and turn green fields and meadows into a lake. The trees looked oddly out of place in the midst of water, while many hedge-rows were entirely submerged, and the ' Cygnet ' stood upon an island. Over the locks and the weir the river swept, as if threatening to carry such trivial impediments away. Upon the waste of waters lowered a heavy sky, boding more rain. ' The flood is still rising,' observed Grace, ' and father says if it comes up much higher the village will be flooded, and we shall have"], [248, "236 A BORN PLAYER CHAr. XVIII to go to chapel in a boat. The old folk tell him they remember being punted down the street.' Matt, looking abstractedly at the flood, made no answer, but presently, turning to Grace, he said, heartily \u2014 'How I wish that my college course had come to an end, and that to-morrow, instead of going away from you, I could carry you off with me. I should be safe then.' He murmured the last words so low Grace did not catch them. ' I wish it too,' she said, with a blush and a sigh. ' But I suppose we must not give way to vain wishes.' The next morning Matt again climbed the coach, and departed, taking with him the warmth and colour of Grace's life. It must be a moonlight existence until his return in the summer. The short spring holidays he was to spend with his mother's relations at Richmond."], [249, "CHAPTER XIX strange tidings Matt's letters, which had before Christmas come at uncertain intervals, now appeared regularly every fortnight, and upon each Grace lived until the arrival of the next. Nobody suspected what those letters were to her. Our friends must judge us principally by our bear ing, so no wonder if the girl's extreme quiet ness imposed upon the curious folk of the congregation, who were keen to see what effect the being ' in love ' had on her. ' I don't believe she cares a bit, for all he's such a beautiful young man, and such a splendid preacher,' pronounced Miss Penny, with a sigh. ' She's such a quiet sort o' body,' returned Dame Brooke ; ' you can't tell whe'er she cares or no.'"], [250, "238 A BORN PLA VER CHAP. Grace the while lived her inner life, troubling not a whit about her neighbours' observations. But presently a shadow crept over her heart's sunshine. Matt had gone to Richmond for his spring holidays, and had written from thence at the beginning of his stay, expressing antici pations of a delightful visit, and promising to send a long account of it when he returned to town. Time, however, passed by ; he must have gone back to College six wTeeks ago, and yet no word had come from him. Every clay Grace looked for a letter ; every day she had to make shift with hope deferred. She wrote three or four times to the silent Matt, then, afraid of burdening him with postage \u2014 for each letter would cost him nearly a shilling \u2014 she waited with what patience she might. She could not hide her trouble entirely from her parents, but the minister, supposing there to be some little difference between the pair, and knowing that to interfere in a lover's quarrel requires a touch as delicate as to catch a butterfly without injuring its plumage, re frained from remark, while the mother set her daughter's depression down to being in love."], [251, "STRANGE TIDINGS XIX 239 Girls were never any good when they began to think about a man. Those of the better sort always got into the dumps, those of the baser sort always turned silly.

Lost in holy musing, he did not notice the sound of quick steps on the stairs, and he looked up surprised when Grace entered the study. ' A letter, father,' she said, with a little catch in her breath. Mr. Unwin took the letter, glanced at the writing \u2014 which was that of the learned Presi dent of Matt's College \u2014 and broke the seal. Grace stood by, trembling. Why did the President write ? Was Matt ill ? Watching her father's face, she saw interest change to blank amazement, and amazement to trouble. ' What is it, father ? ' she whispered. ' I do not understand it at all,' said Mr. Unwin, in a very puzzled way. ' The Presi-"], [253, "STRANGE TIDINGS XIX 241 dent writes to know why Matt has not returned to College.'

The minister spoke in a hurried disjointed way, which increased Grace's alarm. ' 0 father ! ' she cried, ' what can be the matter ?

The good woman therefore eased her pent-up feelings by pouring forth her fears for Matt. ' 0 dear ! if he should be drowned ! ' she cried, the ready tears welling to her eyes.

' Yes ; he is still with his uncle, who was much grieved for the alarm we had undergone ; but in truth, Matt was ashamed to write. Poor misguided lad \u2014 we must pray for him ; it is all we can do.' The minister's voice faltered, and he for bore further speech. He was indeed suffering far more cruelly than appeared ; for Matt was as the apple of his eye, and he verily believed him to be, at the present moment, in danger of utter damnation. Lifting up his heart in silent intercession, he pleaded with the All- Merciful for the erring one.

During this period of waiting she took more to heart the beauty everywhere around her than she had hitherto clone, and in it found a certain pleasure. Involuntarily she con structed a heaven of her own, a heaven of quite a different type from her mother's. It was not drawn from Aldbourne chapel, but from the surroundings thereof. It had the same soft charm, the same tender grace, the same sense of home. Hills and valleys alter nated in it, woods and fields.

' The river of God is full of water,' murmured the girl, as she gazed at the brimming stream that served her as a pattern of the ' river of water of life.' Thus, while she mused, now on the love which seemed so far off, now on the heaven which seemed so near, Christmas came, and brought her a parcel from Matt. How eagerly she opened it and searched for a letter ; in vain, however ; there was no letter ; only a warm gray shawl. With a chill sense of disappointment she took up the shawl, but when she wrapped it around her it might almost have been the embrace of her lover, it warmed her body and soul. Through the cold winter days it was to her the sign of a still en during love, sacred therefore, and every time she put it on she kissed it, as the priest kisses the holy vestment ere he dons it. Matt's gift, so comfortable during the frosts of January, was no less comfortable during the winds of March, which blew this year with their accustomed keenness. One day, towards the end of that treacherous month of bright"], [264, "A BORN PLA YER CHAP. 252 sun and bitter blasts, Grace, enveloped in her shawl, went to see an old rheumatic cottager who occasionally hobbled to chapel. Lately she had taken to visiting the poorer members of her father's flock, especially such as were sick or sorry, for her own trouble had sweetened her nature instead of turning it sour, and she had grown very pitiful over the troubles of others. To-day, indeed, she acted as the representative of the minister, who, with his wife, had been called away to the sick-bed of their daughter Martha ; but none the less was her heart in her work. She was sitting opposite the old man, listening patiently to a description of his pains past and present, when a sharp tap came at the door, and Dr. Beauchamp entered the cottage. Grace thereupon modestly rose to depart. ' What . what ? ' cried the parson, with a deprecating gesture. ' It shall never be said that I drove a lady away. Sit down, Miss Unwin ; sit down.

A short time ago, he says, they all went to the Coburg Theatre to see the young actor, Matthew Hare, in Romeo. The said actor played so well as to drown the women in tears, and make even a certain gallant officer pipe his eye. Of course this officer must needs go behind the scenes, and congratulate his old acquaintance, who wras delighted to see him. And now comes what I particularly wished you to hear. Tony thought our friend looking very pale and haggard. He was home-sick, he said ; pining for Aldbourne and the kind faces there. If he could sit for half an hour on Archer's Hill he believed he should be well. But Heaven forbid that he should try that remedy during March. However, Miss Unwin, what I would say is this : do you not feel inclined to forgive him his offence, and to make your father for give him too ? He is leading a most steady life \u2014 no cards, no wine, no women.' Here Dr. Beauchamp broke off suddenly.

Wondering whether he was tired of his strange life, trying to picture that life, determining to write to him, and then judging it best to wait and ask her father's permission, she passed a good many perturbed hours. One morning, shortly after her meeting with Dr. Beauchamp, she was busy ironing, and in her anxiety to put a fine gloss on her father's shirts she had let other anxieties go, when Kezia came to her with the serene vacancy of her face changed to gaping surprise. ' Here's Mr. Anthony Carew wants you,"], [268, "256 A BORN PLA VER CHAr. miss,' she said bluntly. ' I've took him into the front parlour.' ' He must have come to see my father ; why didn't you tell him that he was not at home ? ' said Grace, setting down her iron in dismay. The prospect of encountering the magnificent young man all by herself was overwhelming. ' He never asked for the minister,' averred Kezia. ' All he said was, \" Is Miss Unwin within, and can I see her ? \" The visit, then, must be intended for her. Stonily she took off her apron, and smoothed down her frock, wondering the while what could bring Mr. Carew hither. Had he some message from Dr. Beauchamp, or had he perhaps come from Matt? With the thought her loitering turned to haste, and forgetting her dread of the visitor, she went quickly to the parlour. As she entered Mr. Carew came towards her, and immediately she was struck by a difference in his manner.

'That is indeed a misfortune,' said Mr. Carew thoughtfully, ' for Matt tells me you have never travelled alone, and have never been to London.'

' I will go,' said Grace, and immediately she had spoken, her terror of the strange journey, and of what awaited her at its end, vanished ; even the fear of her father's dis pleasure was forgotten, and the thought of Matt filled up her mind. ' There is a good, reasonable girl,' said Mr. Carew, his anger quickly turning to approval ; but, anxious to give her no time to reverse her assent, he continued \u2014 ' Can you be ready in a couple of hours ? If so, I will call with my gig and drive you into Dulford to catch the afternoon coach.'

' I will be ready,' repeated Grace ; and upon Mr. Carew's departure she went to prepare her slender bundle, trying the while to steady her mind sufficiently for the writing of a letter to her father. But the letter did not please her when written. The reasons for her strange action, which seemed strong indeed to her, did not look so strong on paper. She must leave them, however, as they were, for no time remained. Hurrying on her final preparations, she just managed to be ready as Mr. Carew appeared at the gate. In a dazed sort of way she got up into the gig, and was driven through the village, never thinking how strange it would appear to the simple Aldbourne folks to see her sitting beside Mr. Carew in his smart vehicle. Just as they were passing by Mr. Masters's"], [275, "GRACE TAKES A JOURNEY 263 XXI shop, out came the prudent Rebecca. Catch ing sight of the pair, she stood transfixed, eyes and mouth wide open. A little farther down the street they overtook Mr. Penny. He, glancing up, started, stared, and finally put on a very knowing smirk. ' I do believe these fools think I am running away with you,' said Mr. Carew, with a short laugh, which changed to a sigh as he looked at his companion, who sat stonily silent, indifferent to all remark. The day was bitterly cold, even for March. The wind was due east, and blew straight in faces set towards Dulford. As it rushed through the valley, it seemed to acquire double keenness, and penetrated Mr. Carew's thick driving coat and Grace's warm shawl as if those substantial garments had been mere canvas. To Grace, however, it was only part of the deathly chill ever creeping nearer and nearer her heart ; she did not really heed it, nor the clouds of grit it whirled in her face, nor the muttered ex pletives with which Mr. Carew occasionally met it."], [276, "264 A BORN PLA VER CHAP. They reached Dulford just in time for the coach, and were lucky enough to secure inside places. The coach then went gaily on through a fair fertile country, and here and there through a pleasant village, or by a gentle man's seat. Mr. Carew would fain have enlivened the way by pointing out every thing of interest ; but his companion's trouble was evidently too deep to be interfered wdth. AVhen, therefore, he had shown her all pos sible attention, he kept silence, though much against his will. Now no sooner was Grace out of Dulford and on an unknown road, than the things which had before been misty grew yet more unreal to her. Surely she was dreaming. The illusion continued when, after travelling some hours, the road began to be crowded with vehicles and bordered by houses : and when at nightfall they went on \u2014 on through a labyrinth of streets that seemed without an end, Grace felt convinced that she was in a wild and whirling dream. But when, presently, the coach stopped, and Mr. Carew jumped out, and began to hector the surrounding porters in his own fashion,"], [277, "GRACE TAKES A JOURNEY 265 XXI the confused girl had a certain sense of reality.

XXII THE BRINK OF FATE 267 and she, ready as ever to take her cue from him, smiled back in answering hope. The very fact of finding Matt on a sofa instead of in bed gave instantaneous relief to Grace's fears. People always went to bed to die ; Matt, therefore, could not be so ill as was supposed. Besides, he looked very much better than she had expected him to do ; thin he was, certainly, but his eyes were even brighter, his cheeks even redder than of old. Grace's acquaintance with sick ness was slight, and though the glitter of Matt's eyes and the brilliancy of his cheeks gave him a touch of unreality in keeping with the phantasmagoria of the whole strange day, these fallacious appearances really de ceived the inexperienced girl. No creature, glowing with such beautiful life, could, she thought, be near death. ' I have been longing to see you,' continued Matt, gazing eagerly at her ; ' and now I can hardly believe my eyes. But it is really you, my little Grace, only rather pale and scared. Sit here, close to me.'

The lover's touch, so different to that of any other, sent a delicious thrill through the girl. How often in her loneliness had she desired it in vain ! ' You dear, good Grace, to come to me,' murmured Matt. Then, a sudden thought occurring to him, he glanced round the room and said \u2014 ' Did your father bring you ? ' 'No, he wTas not at home,' said Grace. 'Mr. Carew brought me. He was very kind.'

In the midst of her bewilderment Grace noticed that Matt spoke to Mr. Carew as to an equal, and she wondered.

But now, my boy, I have brought you what you wanted, so I'll leave you to enjoy it. I'll be back again before bed- time.' Stretching out his hands, Matt laid them on his friend's arms, and Grace saw how transparent they were. Then, contrasting the appearance of the two men, she felt a sharp prick of fear. ' Tony,' said Matt, looking up in his friend's face with his irresistible smile, ' be very careful, for my sake.' ' You may trust me, my boy,' returned Mr. Carew, winking his eyes fast to keep back the threatening tears. ' I wouldn't vex you again for the world ;' and having pressed the delicate fingers in a hearty grasp he departed. ' How good that man has been to me,' said"], [282, "270 A BORN PLA VER CHAP.

So you see, little girl, that even a poor actor may help a weak brother. Ah, Gracie, the world is a surprising place, and down at Aldbourne we knew no more about it than the trout in the Aid know of the great ocean.' And now that Grace was warmed, Matt would have her fed, so he summoned his landlady, who, like women in general, was ready to do his bidding. The good creature showed such a motherly concern for Matt, and for Grace on Matt's account, as gave the girl a sense of home in this strange land. That she was where she ought to be had appeared certain enough directly she set eyes on Matt. He was here, and ill \u2014 then her place was here too.

I wonder if he thinks I might have avoided fate. He does not believe in free will, so surely he must see that I have been but as a straw in the wind of destiny. None the less guilty, say our divines.' With these words a shadow came over Matt's countenance, and fixing his eyes on Grace, he asked \u2014 ' What is your opinion, you tender little soul ?

' I don't ask what you have been taught,' said Matt earnestly ; ' I ask what is your honest conviction. Answer me according to your own gentle heart, not according to the tenets of a hard creed.' ' I am not able to judge in these high matters, I can only accept what I have been taught,' said Grace, fearful of questioning the doctrine of Election, which, though never put by Mr. Unwin in a very prominent place, lest it should prove a stumbling-block to the diffident, yet underlay all his teaching. Then, seeing Matt's eyes still expectant, she con tinued \u2014 ' To our natural mind it does seem impossible that the Father can be anything but pitiful to all his children ; but \u2014 but ' ' You have answered,' interrupted Matt, 'and I would rather trust to your natural"], [285, "XXII THE BRINK OF FATE 273 mind than to the spiritual mind of most theologians.

As she watched him she noted how rapid and shallow was his breathing, noted, too, the change in him more plainly than at first \u2014 the thinness of face and figure, the dark circles round the eyes, the pallid lips. Almost afraid herself to breathe, lest she should disturb what seemed a very light slumber, she watched on, her being divided between anxiety and prayer.

With dawn, however, she slept, and at a late hour was roused by the land lady's voice announcing that the gentlemen were already up, and that Mr. Hare was feeling much better. The good news quickened Grace's move ments. In a short time she descended to the parlour, but at the door she stood aghast. There was Matt looking out of an open window ! ' 0 Matt,' she cried. ' An open window ! ' ' Yes, and a south-west wind coming in,' said Matt, turning to her with quite his old brightness. ' The wind changed last night about three o'clock.

' This is your doing, Miss Unwin ; see the effect of a lady's presence. It brings not only pleasure, but health. Why on earth do I remain a miserable bachelor ? ' So elated was Matt by the genial air that he must needs take Grace out for a drive, just to show her something of London, though to her partial mind the great city was nothing more than the place where Matt lived. When in after days she tried to recall what she had seen, memory showed her only a mirage of streets, churches, people, shifting and unreal as the airy shapes of the desert. Happily the excursion refreshed more than it wearied the invalid, so that night Grace went to bed and to sleep with hope high in her heart."], [288, "CHAPTER XXIII THE RULING PASSION A couple of days passed, during which Matt still grew better, yet Grace did not find courage to unburden her mind of its load. Once or twice she tried to speak, but somehow the words would not come. To her, who had been so long accustomed to listen in silence, speech might well be difficult. Had Matt divined her thoughts, he would have helped her to express them frankly, but happy in the calm of her presence, he lost sight of the barrier between himself and the pious maiden. On the afternoon of the third clay the manager of the Coburg Theatre came in great excitement to inquire after his actor's health.

Every possible precaution should, of course, be taken ; a carriage should be sent for him, he should have the best and warmest dressing-room, should be carefully guarded from draughts. Moreover, the play should be cut short here and there. The public would willingly put up with certain excisions if they could be gratified by the sight of their favourite Romeo again. Matt's eyes glistened. With the revival of strength and spirits had come a craving for the boards. The thought of treading them again took hold of him. Yes ; he was quite well enough to play. He would take his old part to-night. The manager went off in high feather, as may be imagined, for Matt Hare, if not equal to many leading parts, made a most accept able Romeo.

Then, too, while he bated nothing of the lover's passion, he showed a delicacy, a refinement in the expression of it, such as more famous Romeos had sometimes lacked. While the manager was hugging himself on the success of his errand, Grace, who, upon the announcement of a visitor, had modestly withdrawn to her own room, descended to the parlour and heard of the project for the evening. At first horror made her dumb, but presently she found words. ' Matt, dear Matt,' she pleaded, ' you are not well enough for any excitement, and if you were, you would surely not return to this sinful practice. 0 Matt ! ' ' This sinful practice !

You judge it entirely by what certain bigots"], [291, "THE RULING PASSION XXIII 279 have written. Now, Grace, listen to this \u2014 for I have thought the matter out. When Paul was at Athens, the very source of the drama, he said nothing against the stage, but, in the sermon he preached there, actually used, as a sort of text, the words of a Greek play - writer. Neither did he warn the Corinthians to forswear the theatre they loved, but, in his epistle to them, quoted a line taken straight out of a Greek comedy. You must allow, then, that Scripture does not even hint at acting being a sinful practice. But I have not time now to set all my arguments before you ; only trust me, if you could throw away prejudice, you would understand how the stage may have teachers of righteousness as well as the pulpit' ' And this Romeo,' said Grace timidly, quite overborne by the rush of words, ' does it teach righteousness ? ' ' Yes, indeed ! ' cried Matt, his eyes seem ing to emit fire, ' for it shows a love so constant, so devoted, as to dare all dangers, ay, even death itself. And though we can hardly wish all husbands and wives to be as"], [292, "280 A BORN PLAYER CHAP. passionate as Romeo and Juliet, we may well wish them to be as true. But, really, I must not chatter any more, for I want to run through my part, in case any of it should have slipped out of my head.' Reluctant to stay, yet more reluctant to go, Grace sat, while Matt rehearsed the part of Romeo, which, first fanciful, then imagina tive, then impassioned, lifted the hearer by degrees quite out of herself, until she had no notion where or who she was. She was delighted, dazed, almost terrified. What wonder, indeed, that this exquisite wooing, so far away from anything she had ever heard or read of, this glorious p\u00e6an of love, which exalts the senses themselves into soul, should affect the loving-hearted girl ? Seemingly quite regardless of the emotion he was arousing in Grace, Matt went on, sometimes playing to her as if she were Juliet. He had not ended when Mr. Carew came in, and demanded what Matt was ranting about. Upon hearing the rash intent, he burst into vehement deprecation. ' You must either be mad or a damned"], [293, "THE RULING PASSION 281 XXIII fool ! You'll kill yourself. You are no more fit to act to-night than you were a week ago.' ' What ? not wdien I feel quite strong, and have got rid of my cough ? ' ' Got rid of your cough ! ' cried Mr. Carew, in his desire to prevent the folly, blurting out a cruel truth, ' That is the worst feature in your case. Ask the doctor if it is not, and don't be such an infernal idiot.' ' You seem to forget that there is a lady present,' said Matt, setting his teeth deter minedly. ' And what you say about my cough must be a mistake. To get rid of it has been our one aim, the doctor's and mine. Besides, surely I am the best judge of how I feel.' ' You must pardon me, Miss Unwin, for getting into such a rage. It is the Carew temper,' said the soldier, with a fine pride in the family infirmity. ' And really this \u2014 this ridiculous design is enough to make any man angry. Mind you, Hare, if you persist in it, I wash my hands of you ; so, I have no doubt, will Miss Unwin, and here"], [294, "282 A BORN PLAYER CHAP. am I, ready to accompany her back to Aid bourne whenever she likes.' ' My good friend,' said Matt, laying his hand on the angry man's arm with his irre sistible smile, ' you must forgive me if I cannot listen to your arguments. I have promised the manager. A gentleman keeps his promise at all risks. We will not dispute, therefore, especially as I must husband my strength for Romeo. And you will go with me to the theatre.' Mr. Carew stood irresolute a minute, then turned to Grace, and said \u2014 ' I will not take the responsibility alone ; I will only go if you go too.' ' I ! ' said Grace ; ' I go to the theatre ! ' ' No, no,' cried Matt ; ' she shall do no such thing. I will not have her put in purgatory for my sake.' ' Well, I remember hearing of a husband who went down into hell after his wife,' said Mr. Carew, with a sudden gleam of school boy lore ; ' so I should think Miss Unwin might go to purgatory for you, particularly as she is only expected to stay a very short"], [295, "THE RULING PASSION 283 XXIII time. At any rate, if she will not go, neither will I. Suppose you were taken ill, and could not be moved. Suppose \u2014 But there, I say again, I will not incur the responsibility alone.' Both men looked at Grace, and in that supreme moment she forgot her horror of the theatre, forgot to ask what would have been her father's decision ; thrilled by the love music she had been hearing, and yet more by Mr. Carew's words, she returned Matt's gaze, and said \u2014 ' I will go with you.'"], [296, "CHAPTER XXIV ROMEO Paler, more quiet than was even her wont, Grace sat beside Mr. Carew in a stage box at the Coburg Theatre, her close gray gown and unadorned hair making a striking con trast to the gay dresses and beplumed heads near her. Blind to the finery of her neigh bours, and deaf to Mr. Carew's talk, she gazed blankly before her, so possessed by the thought of Matt that the fact of finding herself in a playhouse troubled her not at all. But now the curtain rose, and for the first time in her life Grace looked upon what she had been taught to abhor. The opening scene, with its constant entry of Montagues and Capulets, its sparring bouts, its crowded stage, gave her only a sense of confusion. Nor did she understand the burst"], [297, "CHAP. XXIV ROMEO 285 of applause that welcomed a fresh comer, whose melodious voice, striking with much effect on the commonplace tones of his fellows, said \u2014 Is the day so young ? In truth, Matt made an excellent Romeo. The beautiful face, the noble bearing, the airy manner, which only thinly veiled the ardent soul, admirably realised one's idea of the young Veronese noble. Moreover, to-night there was a strange brilliancy about him, which the manager noted as a good earnest that the young actor might presently aspire to yet finer parts. For some minutes Grace did not recognise, in the strangely-attired gallant with the long golden hair, the man for whose sake she was here, but when she did so, she was filled with shame. He who had been destined to the solemn office of the ministry was ex hibiting himself before these people in a fan tastic dress, and was talking in dainty phrases about love and women. Presently, when Romeo's rapid change of feeling took place, when he wooed Juliet, above all when, as a"], [298, "286 A BORN PLAYER CHAr. banished man, he bade his wife farewell, Grace's shame changed to disgust, to jealousy. She winced ; she went from hot to cold. She was looking on while Matt, not Romeo, made love to another woman. But after a while, in spite of herself, her interest in the story grew so strong as to exclude personal feeling. The Juliet of the night, though not much above the ordinary run of Juliets, was exalted into something like excellence by her lover. Who would not play to such a Romeo ! Inspired by him, then, she acted better and better as she proceeded, until, in the scenes of the friar's cell and the drinking of the potion, she showed real power. When Juliet lay as dead, Grace's tears flowed for the heroic wife, whose rivalry with herself she had quite forgotten. At this time Garrick's version of the play held the stage. Therein, as old play-goers tell, Juliet was made to awaken from her trance before her husband expired. Here the Romeo of to-night was always accustomed to make a great im pression : he now surpassed himself. His delight at Juliet's recovery triumphed over"], [299, "XXIV ROMEO 287 the pains caused by the deadly drug he had swallowed. He soothed his wife, concealing his own agony, which became every instant more acute, until delirium took him. Then slowly, slowly his vigour relapsed ; he grew weaker, wTeaker ; his voice faded to a whisper ; he fell lifeless from Juliet's arms. On the descent of the curtain the applause was loud and long, but it failed to summon Romeo before the audience. After some delay the manager, looking much disturbed, came forward. ' Ladies and gentlemen,' he said, ' Mr. Hare is overcome by his exertions. As you know, he is not in good health. You will excuse him to-night.' ' Just as I expected,' muttered Mr. Carew. ' Come, Miss Unwin, we will go round to him ; ' and with Grace clinging to his arm he found his way behind the scenes. They were met by the manager, who seized Mr. Carew's other arm, saying in a low voice \u2014 ' I am glad you are here. He is in a dead faint. AVe can't revive him. I have sent for a doctor.'"], [300, "288 A BORN PLA VER CHAP. XXIV ' Where is he ? ' asked Mr. Carew hoarsely. ' On the stage ; we haven't moved him.' They hurried on the stage. There lay Romeo, just as when he fell from his wife's embrace. How beautiful \u2014 how ghastly pale ! ' Give him air,' cried the manager to the actors, who, still in stage dress, crowded around with smelling-salts, brandy, and other re storatives. They drew back, while Grace, in an agony of fear, glided on, and knelt beside the faint ing Matt. ' The doctor is here,' whispered the manager to Mr. Carew. Ah ! why did he hush his voice so ? The doctor came ; bent over the prostrate man ; felt his pulse ; laid a hand upon his heart ; then, rising horror-struck, murmured, ' He is dead.'"], [301, "CHAPTER XXV CONCLUSION However hearts may ache, the sun shines, the birds sing, the earth renews her youth ; and to Aldbourne came the full beauty of spring and of summer, notwithstanding the grief that had befallen the minister's family. To Grace, sun shine, the song of birds, and all the pleasant sights and sounds within a stone's throw of her dwelling, were hateful mockeries, seeming as they did to be symbols of a loving power, when in fact that power was hard, cruel, implacable. For from the time when she, recovering from a long, long swoon, found herself in Matt's lodgings, one terror had possessed her \u2014 Matt had died in sin. What, then, must be his fate ? Only when she entered the darkened chamber, and saw the beautiful face of the dead, with the lofty smile, the unutterable calm upon it, u"], [302, "290 A BORN PLAYER CHAP. did the terror leave her. Looking at the fair tenement of clay, so lately informed by a fairer soul, it was impossible to suppose that soul in torment. But the funeral came ; they took him from her ; and she, with her father, who had arrived in town the morning after Matt's death, returned to Aldbourne. She let her friends do what they would with her ; she ate ; she drank ; sometimes she smiled, but it was a smile to wring your heart. And all the while the awful fear was gnawing within. She tried to pray, but failed utterly ; and, after all, of what use was prayer ? The being she held dearer than her own soul had, to her belief, gone out of the reach of any aid. She might make her life one long intercession, it could avail him nothing. And if he were lost, what was salvation to her? A state so unnatural to a pious reverent nature could not last. She fell ill, and in bodily pain found some relief from mental pangs. She tried to tell all her trouble to her father, but he, poor man, involuntarily shrank from the mention of a sorrow that he could not comfort. There was no touch of Antinomianism in his creed,"], [303, "CONCLUSION XXV 291 or he might have stayed himself on the belief that Matt, having certainly once been of the elect, though he had fallen from grace, could not be finally lost. But the minister, dealing honestly with facts, feared that the lad had never been truly called, and his dying in open sin bereft those that loved him of all assurance of his salvation. Still, there were what theologians called the uncovenanted mercies of God ; to these the tender affection ate man must leave the dear soul ; but not without a yearning like St. Paul's when he cried \u2014 ' I could wish myself accursed from Christ for my brethren's sake.' It never struck him how much wider was his own heart than he imagined the heart of God to be, nor did he question the conclusions of those theologians who have encompassed the Divine with the strait bonds of human logic, and supposed the Creator circumscribed by the limits of the creature. One evening, when Grace was growing wearily better, she sat at the window of her bedroom, watching the stars come out in the summer sky, and as she watched she thought"], [304, "A BORN PLA VER CHAP. 292 of the great company of souls departed this life, some assuredly to shine as stars, others reserved for the blackness of darkness. With a sudden enlargement of heart she compre hended how numberless other dear souls, besides the one she loved, must have been and were still wondered about, mourned over. Hers was not the only heart sick with fear of a lost friend's probable fate. Sinking on her knees, the first time for a long while, she prayed. Presently she rose, and again looked out of doors. The night, though moonless, was light, the stars shone kindly down, the trees bordering the garden stood dark against the pale sky, whispering softly in a little western breeze. The hay in the Rectory paddock had been cut, and the scent of it came in at the open window. Mercy seemed to be over all the works of God \u2014 and meanwhile souls were lost, lost for ever. Grace's brain reeled. A tempest was in her weak womanish mind, when suddenly, as if from the presence of the Eternal Himself, flashed through her the question \u2014"], [305, "CONCLUSION XXV 293 ' Art thou, poor little soul, more merciful than God, the very source of mercy ? ' She fell on her knees, as if listening indeed to a divine voice, and as she knelt, all doubt, all fear passed from her. She burst into a flood of happy tears that washed away the bitterness of the past. Yes, she might well trust the soul she loved to the mercy that made it. It and all souls must be safe in such keeping. When she lay down, her sleep was full of peace, and so also was her awakening. Had you known Grace Unwin in after years, you would probably have thought her a quiet and somewhat precise woman, a good housewife, a devoted daughter; but that she had known passion, had been defrauded by death, had fought a way to peace out of the bonds of a strait creed, you would not have dreamed. Yet such women are many ; we touch their hands, we look in their calm faces, and do not know how, in the great mysteries of love and of death, they are wiser than we.
