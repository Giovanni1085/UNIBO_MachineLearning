CICELY Brunel was awaiting him at the garden gate that led out on to the cliff. Behind her and above her rose a group of solemn fir-trees, their velvet crowns clear-cut against the blue. The little path where she stood was edged with a heavy hedge of laurestinus and berberis, and at her feet some early primroses peeped out beneath the gloss of the ever greens. There was a smile in the girl's eyes as she watched her lover coming along the yellow trackway, the great breadth of sea twinkling and sparkling on his left, his gaze wandering from the mellow light that shone over Poole Harbour to the radiance of the B"], [14, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 2 girl-face near at hand. Another moment, the gate clicked to admit him, and a slender arm was entwined in his. \" I have been longing for you to come,\" said the young lady after the first greetings were over, and Major Jardine had bent down to kiss her, more than once, as they passed under the fir-trees. \" It has been such an exciting morning. Poor Joe \" \u2014 Joe was a fat Belgian hare, whose hut was in close proximity to the house \u2014 \" seemed very ill, and I had to ask Anderson to come and look at him. Then my darling Nonpareil would go on catching flies and eating too many, when I wanted him to come back to his cage, and we had no end of bother to induce him to go in ; and, worst of all, dear MacAlister \" \u2014 here she glanced at the collie sniffing the breeze beside her \u2014 \" got a large bone down the wrong way, and I was quite miserable thinking he would cough till he choked ! \" Major Jardine smiled down at the eager face, with its peach-like cheeks and shining eyes. He had lived at least twenty years longer in the world than she had, and was possibly obliged to simulate a greater concern over Cicely's recital than it was quite possible to feel. But he was so genuinely in love with her, that at this stage her merest platitudes seemed to him to be pearls dropping from her mouth, and the adventures of her birds and dogs to be nearly"], [15, "MRS. LIVESEY. 3 as interesting as the proceedings of the present Government. Cicely did most of the talking as they sauntered arm-in-arm towards the white house, which was sheltered by another group of still taller pines. \"What a heavenly day ! \" cried the girl, taking off her hat. \"If Joe were only quite well, I should be perfectly happy. The crocuses are coming up won derfully, aren't they, Dering ? I shall have plenty for the church next Sunday. Now come in and see papa ! \" She stooped to pick a gigantic purple bloom, and handed it to the tall soldier, who put it proudly into his button-hole. People in London, and in former days in society at Simla, had always looked upon Major Jardine as a somewhat cynical, easily bored person. The sort of man who had never a word for a young girl, and in whose presence the subalterns were more than a little subdued. He had a way of raising his eyebrows and smiling silently at their remarks which disconcerted them. But having regard to his reputation as a horse man, and to his almost professional knowledge of the turf, their awe of him was not so great as their admi ration. During these sunny February days his old friends would have found him entirely transformed. He was more than happy talking of crocuses and rabbits and birds, in a little villa by the sea, with only one little girl to walk about with him, and a rather B 2"], [16, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 4 dull old gentleman with whom to play piquet, and that a love-game, moreover, after an early and very commonplace dinner. The only drawback to his happiness was the necessity of making constant efforts to ignore past memories \u2014 recollections which once, long ago, it would have seemed nothing less than a sacrilege to obliterate. ii. Not ev'n in inmost thought to think again The sins that made the past so pleasant to us. At this time Dering Jardine wondered how men could find much difficulty in obeying such an in junction. If he could only have blotted out for ever all remembrance of some five years of his past, he would cheerfully have consented to give up the same number, or more, at the end of life. Now and then, when he and Cicely rambled among the little paths by the crocus-beds, or along the sunny walk that crowned the cliff, the girl would rally him on his preoccupation. How simple and how sweet she was ! thought Dering. The old- fashioned type of girl, who has no curiosity regarding sad or shameful stories, and who would remain young and pure even when her face grew lined and her hair white. The ideal woman, whom so few win, and whose heart held no idol but himself. The outside world, for its"], [17, "MRS. LIVESEY. 5 part, thought Lady Cicely Brunei extremely fortu nate. She had no dowry of her own, her father having sold his estates years ago ; and in the quiet routine of her life at a sea-place inhabited mainly by invalids and dowagers, it had seemed improbable that she would marry young, if at all. But a country house visit and three weeks of London had served to convince Major Jardine that his love was of an abso lutely desperate quality, and a few minutes alone with Cicely proved that it was not hopeless. Lord Overton was naturally overjoyed. His pro spective son-in-law, if a little old for Cicely, was well-born, popular, a good sportsman, and had lately been left no less than half a million in ready money by a well-known banker, his mother's cousin. This last piece of good luck had come upon Major Jardine as a surprise. Most of his youth had been spent in India, where he had always known what it was to be comparatively poor, and more than once he had even been in great pecuniary difficulties. He sighed a little when he looked in the glass at his fast whiten ing hair, and realised how late it was getting to enjoy these good gifts of fortune. If he had been a richer man years ago, he would have married and settled down, and avoided .... His thoughts took him to a garden, where the roses grew in a wild tangle. And there were masses of poinsettias, and flowering creepers holding the trees"], [18, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 6 in their embrace. Beyond, far above the enclosure of the garden, were the solemn, glorious, snow capped mountains. And close at hand to where he stood was a woman, magnificent in figure, with most marvellous long lashes shading her sleepy eyes, and a colour that no Indian sun had been able to blanch. He had come to say good-bye to her, and he seemed to smell again those roses whose perfume was some how intermixed with a feeling of despair and pain. \" If I were free ! if I were free ! \" said the woman. And he had answered : \" It would be Eden over again for you and me. We should never be apart for a single day again ! \" And she had laid her hand on his sleeve. \" Al ways together ! Oh, Dering, will it ever, ever be ? \" Major Jardine rose quickly from his arm-chair, took out his watch, and looked through the window to where the sea-fog was creeping up, sad and gray, obscuring the tall fir-trees, and shrouding the laurestinus bushes that sheltered the garden of his hotel. He would wait for the post, he thought, and then stroll up to Lord Overton's villa. Cicely would be sitting at home to-day, playing piquet with her father, while the mina-bird croaked out his stock remarks from his large cage in the conservatory, and the collie dozed on the rug, hunting in dreams. In a few months' time she, Cicely, would be his wife, living in his own home, with her pets and her books"], [19, "MRS. LIVESEY. 7 about her, and her pretty peach-face flushing with pleasure as her husband came in. Dering stretched his arms over his head and smiled. He had forgotten Simla and its roses now. This morning he had felt melancholy, and had attri buted the feeling of flatness to the heavy, damp atmosphere ; but the thought of being with his betrothed so soon cheered him again. The waiter brought in the second post \u2014 a large pile of letters \u2014 and Dering half smiled as he thought how cheerfully in these days he could contemplate the long en velopes that held bills from his tailor and gunmaker. There was a line from his sister, and one from his greatest friend, a former brother officer and pro spective best man ; and quite underneath the heap was a thick letter with a French postage stamp. Jardine's face changed as he took it up. In spite of this packet having crossed the sea, there still hung about it a familiar perfume. And he almost smiled \u2014 so made up of contradictions are we \u2014 when he observed the peculiar shape of the envelope. \" She always did get the oddest writing-paper,\" he found himself saying aloud. It was nearly an hour before Major Jardine made up his mind to start for Lord Overton's house. The fog was thicker than ever, and scarcely any sea was visible. He had the cliff-walk nearly to himself. Below, a few adventurous people, mounted on long-"], [20, "8 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. tailed, thin horses, were drearily cantering along on the sands, and trying to fancy that they enjoyed it. A shabby woman, who held a basket of damp mimosa on one arm, and blew out a sad tune on a little pipe as she walked, passed him by. But he scarcely noticed anything. The bushes dripped on his hand as he opened the garden gate. A group of starlings were bathing hilariously in a large puddle, and the thrushes were having a feast of worms on the lawn. Through the window came the sound of Cicely's clear treble \u2014 I love thee, adore thee, revere thee, O my dream, my desire, my despair ! She did not put enough passion into the words, thought Dering, as he rang the door-bell. But then he remembered that she was only a child, after all. After a few minutes' talk, Major Jardine told his betrothed and her father, somewhat abruptly, that he found it was absolutely necessary for him to go to London at once on business. The sooner this sort of thing was over the better, therefore he thought that it would be wiser to go off to-morrow. Lord Overton remarked that he was sorry, as he wanted Dering to meet an old friend at luncheon who knew more \"patiences\" than anyone else in the United Kingdom. And Cicely was very sorry too. All the more so, as she was worried about Vie, the fox terrier, and she thought that Dering would have"], [21, "MRS. LIVESEY. 9 helped her to discuss matters with the veterinary surgeon who was coming over. But in the end it was decided that business must be attended to, and Dering Jardine started for London on the following morning by an early train. III. He had had luncheon, and looked into the Turf Club before he hailed a hansom, and told the man to drive to one of the less important streets beyond the Marble Arch. His destination was a small and grimy house, with the legend \" Apartments \" on a dirty card in one of the lower windows. He walked upstairs, his face very pale, and his hand nervously pulling at his moustache, and was shown into a typical lodging-house drawing-room, containing the oil portraits of the owners of the house, a bewhiskered gentleman, and a lady with a brooch as large as a bun, clasping a crochet collar. Every chair owned its own blue or yellow woollen antimacassar, and glass drops rattled and shook in all directions as the visitor entered. A woman dressed in black was resting on the sofa, her arm behind her head, and a pair of shabby shoes sticking out from under a rug. By her side was a table, on which stood a shade of wax flowers, a nickel teapot, and a half-eaten leathery muffin. She started to her feet and came smiling"], [22, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 10 towards Dering. For the sake of old memories \u2014 from old habit, he put his arm round her and kissed her. \" You think me changed ! No, you needn't con- tradict me ! As if I don't know every expression in your face \u2014 dear \u2014 dearest! I know I'm horribly thin ; but then I've been so ill, and the journey was beastly. Besides, there've been all kinds of other worries. . . . But never mind ! Come here and let me look at you ! That is better ! \" She drew him \u2014 he was quite calm and passive \u2014 towards her by both hands, and let her eyes \u2014 pas sionate dark eyes, with extraordinarily long lashes \u2014 rest upon him. She still possessed that one beauty, at all events. But the rest .... Dering felt that he could hardly bear to look at her. Figure, colour ing, the laughing expression of her mouth \u2014 could so much loveliness ever have belonged to this tired, haggard woman, with gray streaks in her hair, and dark furrows under her great eyes ? It was all so pitiful that the man felt more tenderly towards her than he could have dreamed possible. She tried to rattle on from one subject to another, as if she almost dreaded to hear him speak or to meet his anxious gaze. \" I'm not dressed like a widow, as I ought to be \u2014 a widow of only three months' date 1 But I shan't see anybody. And, after all, Dering, those things"], [23, "MRS. LIVESEY. 11 are all humbug, aren't they ! Absolute rot, when one don't care. Don't look so shocked ! I was always truthful, wasn't I, if nothing else? I hadn't seen poor John for some time, till I pulled myself together and went and nursed him. And he really didn't seem to want me when I got there ! Rather hard luck, because you know sick people never were in my line ! \" Dering drew a chair near the fire, and Mrs. Livesey knelt down beside him, resting her head against his knee. He patted her hair just as he used to do. When was it ? It might have been in some other state of existence, in a different and inferior planet. She laid her hot cheek against his hand. \" I hate your coming for the first time to see me in this hole, Dering ! Ah ! what a different back ground it was with the rhododendrons making the garden all rose-colour, and the pink light on the hills ! \" She sighed, and once again that deep feeling of pity for her wrung his heart. \" I am so shabby, too ! \" she went on, with her quick, nervous laugh, fingering her dress as she spoke; \" and I was supposed in those days to be the best turned-out woman in Simla ! But black never suited me, unless it was very smart black \u2014 jet and bugles, you know \u2014 even when I wasn't such a scarecrow of"], [24, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 12 thinness. Oh, Dering, do you remember that last dinner-party you ever came to at our house ? I had on my pink frock that you liked best. . . . And we walked out by moonlight. . . .\" Indeed he remembered it well. The pompous host \u2014 who was a rich Indian civilian \u2014 the young subalterns, the brilliant Mr. George Palmer, just arrived at Simla, and the Members of Council, who would try and absorb the conversation of the radiant hostess in pink satin ! Ah, well ! it was not he, Dering, who was there. It was some one young and foolish and reckless, with an unformed taste, and a judgment weakened and deteriorated by the frivolous life of the hill station. Then in a flash his thoughts reverted to the girl whom he loved, and to her surroundings. He thought of her in the little garden by the sea ; he pictured her in the dim drawing-room, which had an air of curious faded splendour, owing to the presence of some beautiful pieces of furniture and tapestry which Lord Overton had saved from the wreck of his fortunes. That room belonged to Cicely, with her high-bred air and daintily poised head. And with a feeling of disgust at his own meanness, he realised how unsuited to the woman now beside him would have been the old-world grace of those dim, picturesque surroundings. But his hand still lay kindly on her head, till suddenly her voice \u2014 she always spoke rather loudly \u2014 interrupted and jarred"], [25, "MRS. LIVESEY. 13 upon him. He wondered why he had never before noticed that odd, second-rate twang in her accents. \"Town's awfully empty, I suppose, Dering? What have you been doing with yourself? Since we dropped our correspondence \u2014 when was it ? \u2014 I haven't heard a word of you. Oh, stay \u2014 that's rather a cracker, because I did hear that an old boy of some sort had left you money ! \" He started and winced, and Mrs. Livesey noticed it. She laughed her harsh nervous laugh again, and flushed very red. \" Good Lord ! you don't imagine that's why I wrote ? Dering, I'm not such a sweep as all that ! Of course, I used to like clothes awfully, and good dinners ; but you do believe that nothing of that sort would ever weigh with me in comparison with your \u2014 your \u2014 with you ! \" There was no mistaking her earnestness, or the acute pain in her voice. Dering drew her towards him and kissed her. \" I know you always cared for me a million times more than I deserved ! \" said he. Mrs. Livesey went on, speaking very quickly : \" In fact, when I knew you had had a stroke of luck, I \u2014 I hesitated \u2014 all the more because, Dering, I am in desperate straits just now myself for money. John left everything away from me, you see ; for he never forgave me for \u2014 for \""], [26, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 14 Major Jardine could easily have finished the sentence. He was quite aware that his affection for Mrs. Livesey had been discovered by the jealous, violent-tempered husband, who had in consequence systematically made her life as disagreeable as he could. Had Dering not been so harassed himself in those days for money, he would have asked her to leave her husband's home and come away with him. And since then, when her despairing letters had reached him, and pitiful accounts of her hus band's cruelty and meanness, he had often wished that he had. But he had been obliged to come home hurriedly on sick leave \u2014 a favourite sister of his had died \u2014 and in new scenes his reckless love for Maud Livesey had gradually changed to a feeling of much soberer quality. \"What are you going to do now?\" said Major Jardine, in a hoarse, constrained voice. He felt a reproachful flash from her eyes, though he scarcely looked at her. \" I don't know,\" she said, with a sob. \" Some times I feel I don't care a damn \u2014 forgive the ex pression, for you always said women oughtn't to swear ! \" She rose from her knees, and leant her burning face against the shabby mantelpiece. Dering got up too from his chair, and stood beside her. He knew that he was in honour bound"], [27, "MRS. LIVESEY. 15 to this woman, unless honour was a word to be for ever expunged from his rather easy-going creed of morality. He had disturbed her life when she was prosperous, if not happy; for now that the old passion was dead, he could look dispassionately upon the past, and see how easily, how very easily, he might have drawn back in time. It was in consequence of his base selfishness that her later life had been made an absolute purgatory by her husband, and that she was left penniless. She had, in spite of her beauty and a certain recklessness of bearing, been immaculate in conduct until she had known him. Dering remembered that other men \u2014 notably, George Palmer, the brilliant civilian \u2014 had made desperate efforts to overcome her scruples, but that she had always been straight \u2014 except where he himself was concerned. Now she was ageing fast, and hopelessly poor. His obvious duty was to make up to her for all that she had suffered. Some words, vaguely remembered, about \" where withal a man sinneth, by the same shall he be punished,\" recurred to his mind. He had no right to marry a light-hearted child like Cicely, and to leave this woman alone in her misery. \" Maud,\" he said, \" I need not have asked you what you are going to do. We will settle that together \u2014 very soon.\" She looked up at him with the old impassioned"], [28, "16 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. gaze that had, alas ! ceased to thrill him, and flung her arms about his neck, sobbing aloud. He tried to comfort her, to say a few platitudes that would reassure and give her hope. After a time, she sat down again more quietly, and they talked of the future, not of the past now any more. It was nearly seven o'clock when he rose to go. By the light of the gas the little room looked even more sordid and vulgar than by day. On the large round table that occupied the whole centre of the room, lay a Bradshaw, a novel by Marie Corelli, a paper of sandwiches, and a hat, shabby and black, like the rest of Mrs. Livesey's attire. Dering fingered the rusty aigrette plume that ornamented it. He remembered how Cicely, the tender bird-lover, had described to him, with eyes more than half-tearful, the horrible cruelty inseparable from the slaughter of the lovely white egrets. She had spoken indignantly of the heaps of birds left to fester in the sun, after their wonderful plumes had been torn off, and of their desolate young ones crying in vain for food, with a lingering death before them. \" You shouldn't put on that thing ! \" said Dering sharply, for his nerves were jarred, and he felt sore at heart with a blind rage at his destiny. \"Why on earth not?\" laughed Mrs. Livesey. \" It's certainly the worse for wear ; but then, you see, it's been my best Sunday tile for ages ! \""], [29, "MRS. LIVESEY. 17 Dering told her shortly and severely. Then one of the sudden changes that were characteristic of the woman showed itself in her face. Quickly and impulsively she seized the hat, tore out the feather, and flung it into the fire. \"I like your lecturing me, Dering!\" she cried. \" It reminds me of old days. But of course I didn't know ! I hate cruelty with all my heart and soul, though I don't profess much else in the way of morals or merit ! \" Major Jardine smiled quite kindly at her. She was, he saw, in some ways, after all, unchanged. Always emotional, and now and then strangely tender, in spite of an outward hardness of manner. \" Thank you, my dear,\" he said. And he left her with a happier smile on her lips than he had thought to see there. IV. DERING had made up his mind. But his resolution, over-Quixotic, perhaps, failed to bring the least peace to his soul. He took advantage of Cicely's departure from home to visit a friend, to run down to her seaside home and have an interview with Lord Overton. It was naturally of a most painful character. To the poor old man, elated at the thoughts of his daughter's c"], [30, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 18 happiness, and more than a little pleased at having a prospective son-in-law with half a million of money, Dering's announcement was almost stupefying. \" It will kill the child ! \" groaned Lord Overton, twisting himself about in his chair. \"And, my dear Dering, your sense of honour is absurdly overdone. You had a liaison with this woman ; well and good \u2014 many men have done the same, and have married charming girls, and forgotten all about it. Why are you to make a new and far-fetched standard of morals? It's ridiculous! it's preposterous! it's cruel!\" \"I always swore to her \u2014 to Mrs. Livesey \u2014 hundreds of times that I would marry her if her husband died . . . because, till she knew me, she was a woman of spotless character. Had I been one of several, it would, of course, have been another story altogether. But I spoilt her life, and made her husband treat her like the brute he was. Besides, she is now absolutely in need of the necessaries of life. Lord Overton, believe me, I am broken-hearted. . . . Cicely is the whole world to me ! But I cannot help myself.\" He looked out over Cicely's garden, where the snowdrops were peeping out from the dark earth, and the celandines twinkled like little fairy lamps. He tried to fix every detail of the scene indelibly in his mind \u2014 the grass-plat where the starlings were eating, the high laurestinus hedge, the groups of"], [31, "MRS. LIVESEY. 19 pines, the sea \u2014 blue to-day as the Mediterranean. He felt that he was a dying man bidding farewell to the place that he most tenderly loved. Towards the close of the interview the two came to the conclusion that the true facts must be kept from Cicely. She was only to be told that Major Jardine had been engaged years ago to a woman whom he had lost sight of, and who had suddenly reappeared, and that he felt himself bound to marry her, though he was in utter despair at breaking faith with Cicely. Dering returned that evening to London, and wrote a long letter to his betrothed. Her short answer came by return of post, written in shaky, uneven lines : \" If you say this is right, it must be. But I shall always be miserable as long as ever I live. Perhaps God will let me die soon. Don't ever write to me again. I could not bear it.\" It was not for some weeks after this that Major Jardine told Mrs. Livesey, to whom he had now formally engaged himself, of this brief betrothal to Lady Cicely Brunei, and of its ending. She appeared moved at first, then affected to treat the matter lightly, laughing her merry laugh, and lavishing more and more affection upon Dering. He seemed like a man partially stunned. The caresses, the moods, the occasional tears of his future wife were all received by c 2"], [32, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 20 him with a calm philosophy that greatly exasperated her, although she tried hard to conceal her vexation. What was hardest of all was his apparent indifference to the change and improvement in her appearance. She had grown much less thin and haggard, and since her engagement to a rich man she had felt herself justified in ordering several really lovely, though simple, gowns, which she had hoped would please his eye. But now he never seemed even to notice what she wore. When he walked in one morning she was dressed in one of these works of art \u2014 a gray cashmere, with steel embroideries and soft frills of old lace. After a short conversation about future plans and house furnishing, Mrs. Livesey remarked abruptly : \" I saw that girl, Lady Cicely, yesterday evening in the Row.\" Major Jardine started, and an expression that was not flattering to Maud came over his face. But he answered coldly : \" Indeed ! I wasn't aware that she was in London.\" \"Yes \u2014 she is. And I had a good hard stare at her. Dering ! \" \" Yes ? \" He had moved his chair a little further from hers. Mrs. Livesey knelt down beside him. He bit his lip, feeling that it was almost impossible to avoid"], [33, "MRS. LIVESEY. 21 thrusting her away. He did not notice how much softer and prettier her face was than it had been at their first meeting. Her eyes had almost the old liquid look that he had once found enchanting, and her mouth quivered. \" Dering \u2014 she is miserable. I can't forget her face. And she's so awfully young.\" Major Jardine flushed. Almost with brutality he pushed Maud away, and rose from his chair. \" For God's sake don't go on like that ! \" he cried. \" What the hell do you mean by saying these things ? As if I d dn't know ! \" He had walked towards the door. \" Forgive me,\" he said coldly. \" My temper seems to have got worse with age.\" \" Dering, you must not look like that ! Give me up ! \" cried Mrs. Livesey, her eyes shining strangely. His face softened. \" It's no use your talking like this, Maud. One thing only I beg \u2014 let us never speak in this way again. Of course I shall always stick to you. It is fate. What's the use of discussing it now ? It is too late.\" When Major Jardine called for Maud that evening to take her to the Gaiety Theatre, he found to his surprise that she had not put on an evening dress, but was lying on the sofa, wearing a white dressing gown. She had evidently been crying, for her face looked flushed and swollen."], [34, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 22 \" I'm so sorry. I don't feel up to going,\" she said, pushing away her dark hair behind her ears. \" I couldn't smile, not even at good old Arthur Roberts.\" \" I am sorry you are seedy. Perhaps I should be kinder if I left you alone ? \" \" Perhaps you would. Oh, I don't know ! Dering, I am infernally miserable ! \" He raised his eyebrows a little, half sarcastically. \" Don't look like that. It's horrid of you. It's as true as gospel, because I've got to confess some thing awful to you ; and then \u2014 and then \" He looked sharply at her. For the first time during all those weeks he noticed how handsome she was. The line of her throat, the turn of her head, the splendid eyes, that seemed so full of pain, all were beautiful. She rose from her sofa, and stood facing him. \" Least said, soonest mended, Dering. You know, I told you this morning that you must give me up.\" \" For God's sake, spare me a repetition of this ! \" said the man, wearily and impatiently. \" It isn't a repetition. It's something quite new. Dering ! don't look at me while I tell you. You are marrying me because \u2014 because you thought \u2014 that in the old days I always stuck to you. But\u2014 but there ! \u2014 I \u2014 didn't ! \" She drew in her breath with a gasp. Major Jardine, disobeying her, fixed his eyes coldly on her rigid face."], [35, "MRS. LIVESEY. 23 \" I didn't. You remember George Palmer ? \" \"Yes, an infernal sweep \u2014 of course I remember him.\" Mr. Palmer would hardly have recognised himself from that description, Dering found himself thinking, as he recalled the distinguished official's clean-shaven face, his eye-glass, and very effusive manner. \" Well \u2014 he \u2014 was \u2014 \u2014 Oh ! don't make me say it.

In the midst of his sense of supreme relief, of wild joy at his freedom, came an old pang, almost like jealousy, at the thought of the way in which he had been befooled by this woman. He felt as if he could have flung her away like a poisonous snake. He had no thought of pity in his heart, no admiration for the courage of her confession. For one tense moment the two faced each other."], [36, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 24 Then she fell on her knees at his feet, and, without once glancing back at her, he opened the door, walked slowly down the narrow stairway, and left her, with no word of pity or farewelL v. MAJOR and Lady Cicely Jardine had taken a delight ful house in Park Lane, and were one of the most sought-after and popular of couples. The little bride had not yet got over her astonishment that any woman in the world should have been found to throw Dering over ! For this is what she had been told that the second-rate, scheming Mrs. Livesey had done. It was on a brilliant July morning they had come in from an early ride, Cicely having gone upstairs to take off her riding-habit. On the hall-table some letters were awaiting Major Jardine. He went into the library to read them, and started when an odd, oblong pink envelope, and with a gaudy monogram, and very strongly scented, appeared among them. He gave a shrug of disgust, and half doubted whether he would read it. Then he impatiently tore it open. \"I am at Homburg, you see,\" said the letter, \"and I am sure if you saw the company I keep you would think me gone more than ever to the bad. But respectable people bore me. and I bore them. Still,"], [37, "MRS. LIVESEY. 25 I don't want you to think quite unkindly about me, though we shall never meet again. I have a second confession to make in this, the last letter I shall ever write you. \" Oh, Dering, Dering, how could you ever believe the first one ? How could you be so blind as to think me such a degraded, wretched creature \u2014 I, who would have died and lost my soul for you ? Plow could you think I would have had another lover when you cared about me ? George Palmer ! Why, I loathed him ! The only good thing that he ever did \u2014 and that unconsciously, poor man \u2014 was to make you happy, and give you your wife. Of course it was a lie \u2014 an absolute lie ! Perhaps, all the same, it may stand to my good account somewhere \u2014 and I don't suppose I shall have much to boast of but this lie that was for you, dear, and that cost me all the joy I ever can know.

There was no tie of blood be tween them, but their parents were friends, and the little boy and girl, both solitary children, had been playmates from their infancy. He was the elder by a few months ; a handsome boy, with a nervous, emotional temperament, very high spirits, and a mind which was grave and thoughtful beyond his years. She was small and fair, with straight, flaxen hair, and large, very pale blue eyes \u2014 eyes that ought to have been pretty but that they were too widely opened, too unprotected by eyebrows and eyelashes, and set too close to gether in her small white face. She was decidedly not pretty. Perhaps if she had been, her boy-companion might have felt diffe rently towards her ; but she was plain and shy ; she"], [53, "A TEMPERED WIND. 41 had none of the little graceful ways of a pretty, petted child; and so she was only his slave, his admirer, the recipient of his boyish confidences. After he went to school the friends lost sight of each other for some years, and only met again when he had grown into a handsome boy of nineteen, and she was a girl just come out in the world. They met at first upon a different footing; but soon the old influences insensibly crept over them, and they slipped back into something like their childish relations towards one another. He came to her to tell her his plans, his grievances, and even his first love-affairs ; while she listened and sympathised, and tried to advise, hardly liking some of his con fidences, but happy in the thought that she was of use to him. She was a gentle, shy girl, not exactly plain, but with a face which needed colour and animation to give it even a fleeting beauty; and colour and animation were lacking. Her life was not one to enliven a constitutionally depressed nature. It was monotonous and very joyless. Her father had died when she was twelve years old, and then a spinster sister of her mother's had come to live with them, bringing an element of discord into what had been a happy home. Bertha fretted at first under the daily little tyran nies and constant fault-findings, and was jealous of the influence which the strong-minded aunt exercised"], [54, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 42 over her delicate mother; but she only fretted silently and in secret ; she had never the courage to rebel or complain, and yielded herself without a struggle when a point of difference arose. She grew up crushed, and her nature was not one which could bear crush ing, because it had so little elasticity. She should have been lovingly encouraged and made to feel con fidence in herself. She could have borne a great deal of spoiling : it would have made her a far more attractive as well as a happier woman. As it was, she was too gentle and sweet-tempered a creature to grow spiteful, and so from year to year she simply became a little more uninteresting, and people thought her characterless. The only sunshine which came into her life was through her intimacy with Harold, and they did not meet often enough to make it a very constant joy. They belonged to different sets in the great world of London society. He was asked everywhere ; he was clever and agreeable, and people liked him. She went out very little. Her mother and aunt had only a few friends who entertained, and who sometimes thought it their duty to ask her to their houses; but she soon gave up going. The late hours tired her; she was seen at a disadvantage in society; was shy and silent there, and painfully conscious of her own want of success. There were rare days, however, when people were"], [55, "A TEMPERED WIND 43 surprised at seeing a different person in her \u2014 days when, if by chance she was alone, without her mother or aunt, in the little sitting-room at home, if by chance the sun was shining, and other happy accidents combined to quicken her vitality and give her confi dence in herself, her delicate, refined face would light up, and she would talk with animation, and with some subtle charm and quaintness not apparent at other times. But the transformation never lasted long. Those who had seen it might come back the next day, eager to continue the discussion, to renew the intimacy, and find only the ordinary Bertha, all charm and brilliancy gone ; and would wonder how they could ever have thought her anything but plain and uninteresting. Bertha was an heiress in a small way. Both her mother and aunt had fortunes which would come to her eventually, and she had besides a little money of her own. In spite of this no one had ever wanted to marry her, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that no one had ever told her so. There had been one or two men who had hovered round her, but she never gave them encourage ment, and so there were no small episodes to relieve the monotony of her life. No one could have flirted with Bertha \u2014 it would have been an impossibility ; even Harold Wyndham, who flirted with every one, had never"], [56, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 44 thought of it. He would sometimes look in late on a Sunday afternoon, when her mother and aunt were gone to evening service ; he would take the best arm-chair by the fire, and talk to her about himself, his work, and his plans ; but he never flirted with her, and perhaps she was the only woman of his acquaint ance with whom he could have sat for an hour tcte-d tcte in the twilight without doing so. He liked to come and talk to her because she was always sym pathetic, and because he knew that she was fond of him ; but he never thought of her at all, never asked questions about her life or troubles, and only some times, when he was leaving her, it would occur to him to say, \" Bertha, you are the best girl in the world, and I am a selfish brute. I wonder you have patience with me \" ; to which she would answer quietly, \" If I can only be of use to you, Harold, that is all I want.\" It was on those moments, when they stood side by side with joined hands, that she lived afterwards ; they were the spots of colour in her gray landscape. Her youth slipped by before the crisis of her life arrived. It came on a summer's evening, when the London season was nearing its close. She had not seen Harold fora month or more; he had been going out a great deal, and a report was afloat that he was engaged to be married. There had also been other rumours\u2014 that he was hard up, that he was in"], [57, "A TEMPERED WIND. 45 debt, that his father had quarrelled with him, and was going to disinherit him. All these varying reports, with additions and con tradictions, had reached the house in Kensington where Bertha lived, and had been freely discussed before her by her mother and her aunt ; and she was sitting that Sunday evening by the open window, looking out into the dusty street below, with a dull ache in her heart of sorrow and disappointment. Suddenly the door flew open, and he was there, looking pale and ill \u2014 a wreck of what he had been when she had seen him last. \" I've come to talk about myself as usual, Bertha,\" he said carelessly. \" I'm in very low water, and I thought it would do me good to come and tell you about it.\" He took a chair and began an account of his troubles, touching at first only upon the lighter ones. He was in desperate want of money \u2014 he did not know where to turn for a five-pound note. His father was angry with him, and had refused to help him. Then, after a pause, and with his face turned away, he told her about the girl he was in love with, and how she had treated him. It was not quite a new story to Bertha. She had heard the opening chapters of it early in the year, and she knew that it was a more serious affair than his previous fancies had been. The girl was very fascinating, and very lovely, and she had"], [58, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 46 singled him out from amongst her many admirers. She had led him on, and made him believe that she cared for him, and then she had suddenly thrown him over, and engaged herself to some one else \u2014 some one more eligible, a grea' er parti than himself. It had been a severe blow to him. His worn, white face showed how much he had suffered. He sat with his head bent and his hands locked together, restraining his emotion with difficulty as he told his story ; and Bertha sat near him on the window-seat, not speaking much, but helping and encouraging him in her quiet, sympathetic way. \" The fact is, I have wasted my life,\" he said at last. \" I've gone to the devil altogether, Bertha, and I sometimes feel as though I hadn't a friend in the Avorld but you. This might have saved me, if she had only cared. As it is, it's all up with me. If I'd only a little more pluck, I'd go and shoot myself, as many a poor devil has done before.\" He was speaking rather wildly, carried away by his own emotion and her sympathy. He knew him self all the time that he was exaggerating the hope lessness of his position, putting it all rather too melo dramatically ; but it did him good to pour out his trouble and make the worst of it \u2014 to heap up the agony, with Bertha sitting there sorrowful and over awed, as she used to sit in the old days when they were both little children."], [59, "A TEMPERED WIND. 47 He did not calculate upon the effect his story might have on her. She sat so still beside him that no one would have suspected the storm that had risen in her breast, bringing with it a sudden fierce longing to comfort him at anv cost. When he had finished she rose from her seat and leaned against the table to steady herself. \" Harold,\" she began, with an odd catch in her voice, \" I have known you all my life, or I could net say what I am going to say. I have a little money of my own \u2014 a very little \u2014 just my savings for the last few years. Will you take it ? \" He looked up quickly as though to protest, but she put up her hand to silence him. \" Listen,\" she said slowly. \" What I want to give you is nothing \u2014 nothing at all \u2014 for I love you. I have always loved you. I am poor now; I could not be of use to you, and I would not wish to be a burden upon your life ; but some day in the future I shall be rich, and then if you will come to me when you are old, and tired of your life and your amusements \u2014 if you will come to me then, you shall have all.\" She had grown quite calm while she was speak ing. The great wave of emotion which had swept over her had passed. She was not trembling any more. She stood beside him speaking quietly, in a voice full of tenderness and entreaty ; her face, as"], [60, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 48 she looked down at him, was almost spiritual in its expression of purity and unconsciousness of self. He did not answer her at once. He had drawn himself up in his chair and turned his face away so that he might not see her. He felt as though a douche of cold water had been thrown over him, waking him with a great shock out of his absorbing thoughts. He was not touched in the least degree by what she had said to him ; he only felt dis gusted, shocked, filled with shame for himself and for her. He was not less conceited than most men, but because he himself had never thought of Bertha in that way, the idea of her falling in love with him had not once crossed his mind during all the years that he had known her. Her confession came upon him like a thunder-bolt, and for a few moments he wondered hopelessly how he should answer it. There was a painful silence, and at last he forced himself to speak. \" I feel I can never thank you enough,\" he said stiffly ; \" but it is quite impossible. I could not offer you anything but the best \u2014 it would be wrong both to myself and to you \u2014 and the best, God knows, I cannot give you.\" Then he rose to go. He had spoken kindly, but in his heart he was angry with her for having placed them both in such a false position. He was ashamed"], [61, "A TEMPERED WIND. 49 and uncomfortable, and wanted to put an end to the interview as quickly as possible. Apparently she had no such feeling. She had risen above conventionalities ; they had ceased to affect her. She did not blush, or seem embarrassed ; she only smiled at him rather sadly as she put out her hand to say good-bye. \" You are wrong,\" she said. \" I believe that you have always given me the best ; and that I alone know the best and truest side of your character. Some day, perhaps, you will see it as I do now ; and, meanwhile, remember, I will always be your friend.\" This had been the crisis of her life, and after wards they did not meet as often as they had before. Gradually \u2014 so gradually that no one except Bertha noticed the change \u2014 he came less and less to the house in Kensington, and when he did come it was at an hour when he knew that the older ladies would be at home. If by chance he was left alone with her, Bertha tried to bring the conversation back to the old footing, tried to make him tell her about himself; but he evaded her questions, he was nervous and embarrassed \u2014 for him the old comfortable friend ship was destroyed. Years passed without any fresh event coming into Bertha's life. As she grew older she faded slowly. The blue of her eyes became paler; her hair lost its E"], [62, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 50 soft touch of gold, and her complexion grew dull and colourless. Perhaps if Harold had married soon after \"the crisis \" there might still have been time for her to root him out of her heart; but he did not marry. His affairs righted themselves, and things went smoothly for some time. Then his father died, and he succeeded to a heavily burdened property, so that he had to shut up the country home and live in rooms in London, and every one told him that it was his duty to marry an heiress. But although he went out still, and amused himself, he could never quite make up his mind to take the final step. And so Bertha could still hope and wait, and as they both grew older, instead of losing heart, she only became more confident, more sure than ever that he would return to her in the end. One winter Bertha's mother became seriously ill. Bertha and her aunt nursed her between them for many long, anxious months, until, when the spring came, she was well enough to go for her daily little drive, and to talk hopefully of her yearly move to Bath in the summer. Then Bertha was taken ill herself. The long strain had told upon her, and for some months she had been growing weaker. One night, when she had climbed the three flights of stairs leading to her"], [63, "A TEMPERED WIND. 51 room, she fell forward upon the floor outside her bedroom door. The maids found her lying there half an hour later, and had great difficulty in bringing her round. She begged that nothing might be said about it ; she did not want to make a fuss and frighten her mother; and the next day she seemed much as usual, only a little paler, a little slower in her movements as she went about the house. The story of the fainting fit was kept from her mother, but it reached her aunt's ears, and she spoke to the doctor about it. Bertha needed change, he said, and absolute quiet. She must go somewhere where she would have bracing air and nothing to worry her, and she would soon be well again. And so it happened that when, early in July, the invalid mother and her sister moved from London to Bath, Bertha went down by herself to a watering-place on the south-east coast, where a former maid of her mother's kept a lodging-house. The fine air and the sunshine revived her quickly, but she could not shake off the feeling of apathy which for some time had been creeping over her. Every day she took her work and her book and went down to sit on the beach ; but she seldom worked or read. She sat for hours watching the waves rise and break on the shingly shore, and listening to their low, monotonous sound. e 2"], [64, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 52 The sea fascinated her ; she loved to watch the constant changes passing over it \u2014 the shadow cast upon it by the fragment of a cloud, the dazzling glitter of the sun kissing the waves, or the dull purple which a gust of wind brought as it swept swiftly across. She loved it in all its varying moods\u2014 gray, or bright, or stormy; but she loved it best as it looked sometimes late in the evening, when the sun, sinking behind her, turned the pebbles on the shore to gold, and it rose beyond, clear and still, a vivid blue against the opal tints of the sky. She was sitting, one Sunday evening soon after her arrival, in her favourite place under the shadow of a fishing-boat ; an open book lay in her lap, and she was looking out, as usual, over the restless water. Suddenly she was roused by the sound of foot steps on the shingle above her. They were a man's steps ; she could tell that because they were sharp and distinct, with no sweep of petticoats between, and they were too firm and heavy to be those of a child. They came nearer, and then stopped close to where she was sitting. She wondered lazily whether it was worth while to open her eyes. She was so comfortable lying there; the heat had made her drowsy, and disinclined for the least exertion ; but at the same time she was curious to see who it was who had come to disturb her solitude, and in the end her curiosity triumphed."], [65, "A TEMPERED WIND. 53 A man in a dark-blue suit was standing a few paces away from her, looking out over the sea. As she opened her eyes he turned, and they recognised each other at the same moment. \" Harold ! \" \" Bertha ! \" There was a short silence. Bertha flushed quickly, and then grew pale again; he coloured also, and a momentary look of annoyance crossed his face. \" How odd to meet you down here !\" he said with rather forced gaiety. \" What on earth has brought you ? I imagined you were at Bath with your mother.\" \" I have not been well,\" she answered faintly. She leaned back against the boat again, drawing each breath with difficulty, because of the fast beating of her heart. All at once he was frightened as he realised the change in her since he had seen her last. She had aged many years. Her profile was cut clearly against the dark side of the fishing-boat, and he could see how her features had sharpened, how deep the hollows had grown on either side of her forehead, and above her eyes. Her hands, clasped over the open book, looked unnaturally white and transparent ; they were the limp, nerveless hands of a person who has been very ill."], [66, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 54 The thought flashed across his mind that she was going to die. He sat down on the shingle beside her, and began to speak very tenderly, as he had not spoken to her for years. \"Yes, I see that you have been ill. You look ill still, Bertha. You have been overdoing yourself, as usual. Your mother and aunt always expect too much of you, just because you never complain. You must be selfish for a bit, by way of a change. You must take care of yourself down here, and this splendid air will make you all right soon.\" Her colour came again, and faded as quickly ; but she was recovering from the first shock of seeing him, and she answered quite cheerfully, so that he was reassured. \" I know it will ! I feel better already, only so very lazy. I bring out my book, you see, and sometimes my knitting, but I very seldom do any thing. I sit and watch the waves; it's dreadfully idle of me.\" \" The very best thing for you,\" he replied, looking away from her. \" Don't bother to work just yet.\" \" And you ? \" she asked. \" Why are you here ? It's the very last place in the world where I should have expected to meet you.\" \"I've only run down for Sunday. I am staying with a friend who has a little place called Woodlands, about two miles inland, and I walked over this"], [67, "A TEMPERED WIND. 55 evening to have a breath of sea air. I was here last week also. It's a delicious little place. The worst is going back to London on Monday morning.\" Gradually, as they talked, his first alarm about her wore off. After all, she had always looked pale and thin, he said to himself, and she seemed in good spirits and quite happy about her health. \" You will be here again next week ? \" she asked timidly, when he rose to leave her. \"Probably. And I shall certainly see you if I am. Tell me your address. I'll come on Sunday, and if I don't find you indoors, I shall know where to look for you. Good-bye ! Take care of yourself, and get strong.\" Wyndham walked back over the downs to his friend's house with an uneasy feeling in his mind. He could not quite shake himself free from his first anxiety about Bertha ; and with it much of his former tenderness and affection for her had revived. He remembered all that she had been to him in the past \u2014 the safe, true friend upon whom he could always rely ; who, even after that painful episode when he had been forced to be brutal to her, had never wavered, never altered towards him in the slightest degree. He thought of her dreary, sunless life \u2014 of all, that is to say, that he knew of it, and its pathos struck him for the first time. He wondered what he could do to cheer her. He"], [68, "56 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. would write to her, he thought, from London during the week; and he would make a point of coming down on-the following Saturday in order to see her. He resolved that if it were necessary he would even sacrifice some pleasant invitation so as not to dis appoint her. It comforted him to think that he would be doing something for her, bringing a little pleasure into her dreary Sunday afternoon. It made him feel happier, and more at ease about her. He was still thinking of her when he reached the lodge-gate of Woodlands, and walked up the long avenue of lime-trees leading to the garden. It was growing late. People had gone in to dress for dinner, and the garden was deserted. On the right, beyond the dark line of trees, the sky was dyed crimson by the setting sun ; above, the broken clouds had turned to pink and gray. The house, standing rather high upon the terrace, caught the reflection of the sunset, and its uninteresting stucco walls were bathed in delicate rose-colour. As he stood hesitating whether to go in or linger a few minutes longer, a girl stepped out of the middle window on to the terrace, paused to glance at the sunset, and then, catching sight of Wyndham standing below in the shadow, came slowly down the flight of steps towards him. For a moment she also was wrapped in the rosy light; then, as she descended step by step, the shadow crept over her,"], [69, "A TEMPERED WIND. 57 till she stood beside him in the gray twilight of the garden. She was a fair, pretty girl, with a sweet little childish face and slim figure. She was dressed for dinner already, very daintily, in a soft white gown with a yellow sash. Her arms and neck were bare, and she wore no ornament upon them. Involuntarily, as Harold looked at her, the con trast forced itself upon his mind between this child, in her fresh, joyous loveliness, and the faded woman whom he had left sitting by the sea. He had hardly noticed the girl before. He knew that her name was Dorothy Richards, and that she had come, like himself, on a two-days' visit, with her mother, a rather vulgar, pushing woman. He remembered also having been told by some one that she was an heiress. He had not spoken to her yet ; he fancied that she would not interest him, and he had therefore not gone out of his way to make friends with her. He had seen her laughing and talking with the other girls the night before, and had ticketed her rather severely in his own mind as something very young and silly. But to-night she appeared to him transfigured in some strange way, first with the glow of the sunset upon her, and now in the softening shadow of the twilight. She was not laughing. Her eyes were grave and gentle, and her mouth serious."], [70, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 58 \" I've come out to get a rose for my frock,\" she said shyly. \" I'm ready early, because our maid has to dress mamma as well as me.\" He did not answer at once. A vague, delicious emotion was stealing over his senses \u2014 due partly to the hour and the place and the beauty of the sky, and partly to some suddenly awakened sympathy between himself and his companion. He knew that she must feel it also, although they had never spoken to each other before, because such emotions cannot affect one of two people standing side by side without in some degree touching the other. How far she was conscious of it he could not tell ; he could only judge that she was moved by the deepening colour in her cheeks and the quivering of her long lashes. \" A rose do you want ? \" he asked presently, his own voice sounding rather strange to him. \" Come up on to the terrace again ; we shall find the best there.\" They turned, and walked silently up the steps and along the terrace. The rosy light was dying as the shadow crept upwards, but it still shone upon their faces, and Wyndham fell back a little behind the girl, so that he might watch the glow upon her cheek and neck and bright hair. \" What a lovely evening ! \" she said. \" Have you been for a walk ? \""], [71, "A TEMPERED WIND. 59 \" Yes, I've been down to the sea-shore. And rather a strange thing happened to me. I met a very old friend, whom I hadn't seen for months. We had a long talk, sitting under a fishing-boat.\" The girl walked on without turning her head. \" Really ! How strange ! \" she said. \" Was it a man or a woman ? \" \" A woman,\" he answered, smiling a little at her question. They had reached the end of the terrace, where masses of roses \u2014 pink, and white, and red \u2014 were trained over a low trellis-work. The girl stooped to smell them. \" Was it a young woman ? \" she asked, with her face hidden amongst the flowers. He smiled again, and waited a moment before he answered her. \" I told you she was an old friend,\" he said vaguely. \" As old as I am ! We were children together.\" She drew herself up, and gave him a quick glance. He was standing over her, looking very tall and handsome in the soft light. She could see that his hair was thick and brown \u2014 he might be thirty, she thought, and that did not seem to her so very old. \"Was she pretty?\" she asked, as she turned away again."], [72, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 60 He could follow the flight of her thoughts, and saw the conclusion she had drawn from her glance at him, and he was flattered. \" What a catechising you are giving me ! \" he said, laughing. \" Pretty ! No, not in the least \u2014 and never has been ! \" The shadow had reached the terrace now, and the magic light was gone. \" I must get my roses and go in,\" the girl said suddenly. \"Mamma will think I shall catch cold out here, though it is really quite warm and nice.\" She moved a little away from him and bent over the flowers, touching first one and then another, as if she could not make up her mind which pleased her most. \"What will you have?\" he asked. \"What will suit your gown best ? Pink, perhaps, with your yellow sash. There are some beauties near you.\" She put out her hand to take one, but he stopped her. \"Not that one! \u2014 it is too full-blown for you. You must have a pink bud, just opening. Let me pass ! I will pick it for you.\" Harold kept the promise he had made to himself, and wrote to Bertha during the week a short, kind letter, asking how she was, and telling her that he would be with her on the following Sunday."], [73, "A TEMPERED WIND. 61 It was raining hard when he walked over from his friend's house. He found her alone in her shabby little sitting-room, with its comfortless furniture, and the large uncurtained bay-window, facing the sea. She was standing up when he came in, bending over the tea-table, busy preparing the tea. There was a faint colour in her cheeks, and she was smiling, and by the subdued light she did not look to him half so ill as she had done on the beach, in the glare of the sunshine. He was relieved. He sat with her a long time talking ; but for once it was she who talked the most. He did not wish to touch upon his own affairs; so to avoid them he asked about herself, her mother, all she had beea doing during the past months, with more interest than he usually showed in what concerned her. At length he rose to go. \"Not next Sunday, nor the Sunday after,\" he said in answer to her question ; \" but before long I shall be back, no doubt. I'll write to you mean while ; and you might send me a line now and then, to say how you are getting on. Good-bye, Bertha ! \" She followed him out on to the landing, and he took her hand again. He stood a step below her on the staircase, so that their faces came upon a level with each other. For a moment he was tempted to kiss her. It would have been quite allowable, he thought; he had known"], [74, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 62 her for such a long time, and he was fond of her; but he checked himself, remembering all that had passed between them, and searing that it might be mis understood. \"Good-bye,\" he said again rather coldly, and turned and went down the staircase. A month passed before he returned to Woodlands, and then he came to stay on a longer visit than usual. His work in London was over, and he was to spend the first week of his holidays there. There was a large party in the house, and amongst them were the pretty little heiress, Dorothy Richards, and her mother. It was sultry weather \u2014 perfect weather for lying in comfortable garden-chairs under the trees, in the first ecstasy of idleness which comes over tired London people when they get to the country at that time of year. No one was inclined to exert them selves, and from day to day Harold put off walking down to the sea-shore \u2014 even put off writing to tell Bertha that he had arrived. He had heard from her constantly during the past month; and her last letter, received a week ago, lay in his pocket unanswered. He told himself that he had not written because he wanted to surprise her by appearing one day upon the beach ; but this was not the truth \u2014 in reality he"], [75, "A TEMPERED WIND. 63 was getting very much bored by the correspondence. The sudden interest, born of his anxiety about her, died out gradually as his uneasiness wore off; and the letters became merely an annoyance to receive, and a trouble to answer. He did not admit as much as this to himself. He was, of course, very fond of her ; very glad to hear that she was well ; but he wished she would not write quite so often, or so much. Her letters were always long, and they came so terribly soon after he had sent his short replies. There was a special reason why just then the perpetual correspondence annoyed him. He was considering very seriously whether he should take the great step of his life, and propose to the girl who had first attracted him in the garden at Woodlands. He had seen her very often since, in the world and at her own house ; he had gone to balls and parties on purpose to meet her; they had grown to be quite intimate. The sound of her merry little voice and rippling laugh, and the flutter of her ribbons and soft summer frocks, had all become part of his daily life. Perhaps he was not very much in love with her, but he was charmed by all that was fresh, and innocent, and joyous in her. And he could see that she was ready to care for him \u2014 that she preferred his society to that of the other men who hung about her."], [76, "64 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. He had known so well how to make her love him, how to flatter her childish vanity, and win her light, butterfly heart. But just because he was so sure of her, and could read so plainly all that passed in he. mind, a generous feeling made him hesitate and reflect whether he was justified in taking this little half-fledged bird, who seemed so willing to be caught, and who knew nothing of the world and its risks and temptations. The question was still undecided at end of the season. He had said good-bye to her at the last ball, trying not to see the distress in her tell-tale face \u2014 not to understand what she meant when she said to him, with a little burst of passion, \" I hate the end of the season ! I hate the word ' good-bye ' ! \" He had not even pressed her hand when he left her, though he knew very well that they would probably not meet again until the following year. He had resolved to leave her free, and to take the chance of her forgetting him. But fate, in the persons of the master and mistress of Woodlands, had proved too strong for him. When he arrived there late one sultry August evening, he was told by his hostess that Mrs. Richards and her daughter were among the guests, invited on purpose to meet him. There was a little summer-house at the foot of"], [77, "A TEMPERED WIND. 65 the garden, commanding a wide view of meadow and cornfield, with the sea lying in the distance ; and there Dorothy Richards would often go by herself in the morning. She always took her book with her, and made a pretence of reading; but after a time Harold Wyndham would stroll along the path to join her, and they would sit and talk, looking out over the sunny landscape. One morning he surprised her there just as she was finishing her novel, and saw her throw it down with a little petulant gesture of annoyance. \" What's wrong ? \" he asked as he took his usual seat. \" Wasn't it a nice story ? \" She lay back in her corner and shook her head. \"No, a horrid, silly story. It ended badly. I think people ought to be punished when they write books that end badly.\" It was one of her impulsive, childish speeches, which half charmed and half annoyed him. \" Unfortunately,\" he said, looking away from her over the green lawn to the sea, \" things don't always come right in real life, and so the novel-writers, whose first duty, I suppose, is to make their stories natural, are obliged to let them end badly some times.\" \" Yes, of course, people must die occasionally at the end of books,\" she admitted. \" But what I dis like much more are misunderstandings, and when F"], [78, "66 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. things almost come right, but just don't. I think if the people are going to live at all, they ought to ' live happily ever after ' on the last page.\" \" Perhaps ! \" he said vaguely. \" Certainly it would be more satisfactory.\" \" I often look at the last page first,\" she went on, \" and see if it is all right before I begin. I hate to be made sad ; especially if I am a little sad myself already. But I didn't look at this book ; I felt that I was so happy here that it didn't matter.\" She had taken off her hat, so as to be able to lean back more comfortably, and she was fanning herself lazily with its wide brim. \" Are you often a little sad ? \" he asked softly, at the end of a long silence. His question, and perhaps the tone of his voice, roused her to self- consciousness, and she blushed quickly. \" No. IVe had a very happy life,\" she said simply. \"But I can imagine sorrows. If mamma died\u2014 or if \" She gave a deep sigh and looked away. \" Or if what ? \" he asked, watching her face. \" Or if the people one cared about went away from one,\" she said decidedly, after a moment's hesitation. He put out his hand suddenly, and laid it upon the one of hers that was nearest to him."], [79, "A TEMPERED WIND. 67 \" Would it make you a little sad if I went away from you, Dorothy ? \" he asked. \" Yes ! \" \" More than a little ? A great deal more than a little ? \" \" Yes ! \" His hand closed more firmly over hers \" Dorothy,\" he said gravely, \" when I said good bye to you in London, I wanted to leave you free. I thought that you did not understand enough \u2014 that you were too young \u2014 that you would forget me before we met again. Was I wrong ? \" She did not answer. She had turned away from him, but he could see that her face had grown white, and the little hand that lay in his was trembling. \" Think before you answer me. You are so young still \u2014 such a child, and I Has it come too suddenly upon you ? Shall I go away and let you try to forget me ? Your life is so bright. Do you think that you would miss me for long ? \" He spoke very gently, looking down at her, still holding her hand in his own. She had not once looked up. On her long lashes tears were glistening. She could not speak, but nodded her head slowly \u2014 a movement which was half pathetic, half comic. He passed her little hand from his right one into his left, and put his arm round her. F 2"], [80, "68 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. \"Are you sure, dear? Do you realise what you are doing? That you are giving yourself to me for ever?

And, do you know, I am almost old enough to be your father ? \" She raised her head then quickly. Her eyes were swimming with tears that brimmed over as she moved, and rolled down her cheeks. \" Don't \u2014 don't speak like that ! \" she said with a sob. \" You frighten me.\" He drew her nearer to him, and she turned her face and hid it on his shoulder. \" My darling,\" he said, \"is it really true that you love me ? Lift your little head and answer me. Do you love me enough to marry me \u2014 enough to give up your happy girl's life for my sake ? Are you sure ? \" She lifted her head slowly to obey him, shrinking timidly from his searching gaze. Her eyes were still wet, softened and beautified by her tears ; her lips were twitching. \" Do you love me really ? \" he asked again ; \" in spite of my gray hairs \u2014 in spite of everything ? \" She made a great effort to answer him, but as she spoke her voice broke. \"Yes, of course I do ! \u2014 of course !

Don't look at me like that ."], [81, "A TEMPERED WIND. 69 You make me feel so dreadfully \u2014 dreadfully frightened and miserable.\" She hid her face again on his shoulder and burst into tears. He could feel her whole body shaking with her heavy sobbing. He still hesitated a moment, gazing out with a troubled look to where the blue sea melted into the blue sky. Then with a half-sigh he drew her close to him, and bent and kissed her. Late in the afternoon of the same day, Wyndham walked alone over the hills down to the sea-shore. A painful duty was before him : he was going to tell Bertha of his engagement ; and he wished to tell her himself, and at once, before there could be any danger of the news reaching her from another source He felt that it was due to her that he should do this ; but he dreaded the task, and the painful scene which he feared might follow. Her last letters, innocent as they were in reality, had revived all the old unpleasant feelings towards her, which of late he had begun to forget. The scene when she had told him that she loved him rose before him with painful distinctness. He could remember the minutest details : the little hot room, the growing darkness, her white face, with the fair hair brushed smoothly back from her temples, and her large blue eyes fixed upon his"], [82, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 70 with their steadfast, searching gaze. Would she look like that again ? he wondered. Would he have to see her face change, and an expression of sorrow and reproach come into it ? And if so, what could he say to comfort her ? He had thought at first of writing ; but a letter is such a cruel messenger to send with bad news ; he felt that it was a mean way of getting out of the difficulty. It had, besides, another objection. He did not know exactly how much or how little to say about the past. He resolved to go himself, and to tell her with his own lips. But he tried to put off the evil hour for a while. He did not go straight to her house, or to that part of the beach where she was accustomed to sit ; he walked down to the sea-shore by another path, reaching it half a mile outside the town. The tide was low, but just on the turn to come in ; patches of wet sand were visible, and here and there were a group of mossy rocks, with attractive pools beside them. He sat down upon the shingle to consider how he had best break the news. The soft air upon his face felt refreshing after the heat of the day. He took off his hat and lay back upon the stones, thinking of Dorothy Richards's little bewitching face, fancying that he could hear her voice speaking to him between her sobs \u2014 could feel her head nestling against his shoulder. Then he"], [83, "A TEMPERED WIND. 71 gave a long sigh, which was not altogether a sigh of contentment. He had taken the great step \u2014 it was done for better or for worse, and he was glad ; yet he could not shake off a vague feeling of depression. It was not enough to make him regret what he had done, but it troubled him, and clouded the brightness of the future. Presently he remembered the errand he had come upon. He sat up and looked at his watch. It was six o'clock. The sea had crept a little nearer while he lay dreaming ; the patches of yellow sand were fast being hidden, and a great rock, standing out boldly apart from the rest, was touched now and again by an advancing ripple. \" When the sea washes round the rock I will go,\" he said to himself, and he sat watching it. Again his mind strayed away from what he had to do \u2014 back to the little girl at Woodlands \u2014 back to wondering whether he had done right, with a vague doubt and unrest mingling with his happiness. The waves crept higher towards the green rock, and at last a bolder one than the rest ran up and encircled it, and then sank back again, leaving a dark stain upon the stand. \" I'll wait until the sea reaches the shingle,\" he thought, \" and then I'll go \u2014 and I must plan what I am to say to her.\" He set himself to think about it in earnest this"], [84, "STORIES' AND PLAY STORIES. 72 time. He would go to her house ; it was probably too late to find her on the beach. She would be sitting there alone in one of the comfortless arm chairs, or lying on the sofa. She would be surprised at seeing him \u2014 she would probably start up, and her face would flush with pleasure. He would go to her at once, and take her hand and say to her, \" Bertha, I have got some news to tell you, and as it is some thing that has made me happy, I know that you will be glad for my sake.\" Then he would turn away and go to the window, and stand with his back to her for a moment or two, giving her time to recover herself. And from there, with his back still turned towards her, he would tell her what it was. He felt that he must be prepared for the worst, and the worst would be that she would burst into tears. Then he would go to her, and say as he bent over her : \" Bertha, you have always been my best friend. I have not been worthy of all you would have given me ; but I want you to know that I have never ceased to feel grateful \u2014 never ceased to regret that I could not give you more.\" It was not quite the truth; he had not always felt grateful, but he thought the lie was pardonable under the circumstances.

The street-door was open, and he went in and up the stairs without meeting anybody. Outside her sitting-room he paused and knocked softly. There was no answer. She might be in the room beyond, he thought, and he opened the door and went in.

Ridgetop Farm was a small, ancient-looking stone building, two low storeys in height, with a pent-house of a stone slab on carved stone brackets over the door, and mullioned windows with labels over them. A couple of ash-trees in the yard relieved the bareness of the situation. They stood well over the house, and helped it to look snug, which always seemed to be its ambition, and in which it generally succeeded, and, when it did not quite, still made you respect the effort. 'Liza helped her mother with the butter, calves, pigs, and poultry. On Sundays she went down to a little gray stone chapel, which stood among a few cottages by the water-side in the valley, like a self conscious feeling among necessary daily thoughts. She had the fair skin, with well-marked brown-sugar coloured eyebrows and thick hair and blue eyes,"], [98, "86 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. which so often occur on that moor.1 She knew no young men, except those whom she had known all her life ; and she had no ambition whatever. But it happened, about the time 'Liza was twenty-one, that a farm larger than Ridgetop, and much nearer the bottom, in the direction of Thrutch den, became vacant. Julius Lee had long desired to get on to a farm nearer one of the towns, and so he seized this opportunity, and the family shortly moved to the new steading, which was called \"Nab Close.\" An old pack-horse road ran past this farm, which went straight from Thrutchden over moss, moor, and fell, to an ancient town fifty miles to the north. On the portion of this road which lay between Thrutch den and the tops the homesteads of a good number of the farms were built, so that they lay pretty near together, and the Lees were not now without neigh bours. The next house, in fact \u2014 that of the Kays \u2014 was not more than a hundred yards away. So it may be supposed that only a very short time elapsed before 'Liza's blue eyes lighted on the lengthy figure of young Andrew Kay. Andrew Kay was thirty years old. He shaved his brown face clean every Sunday morning. His mouth had thin lips, the upper one of which curved outwards with a pretty, petal-like curve. His eyes were blue, just the same colour as 'Liza's, and they had a shrewd, humorous expression. He was of a"], [99, "'LIZA LEE'S METHOD. 87 progressive temperament, and was wrapped up in the success he was achieving in improving the stock and the butter of their farm. The Kays' name was becoming well known at the innumerable agricultural shows in the county ; and it was well understood on the show-grounds that young Kay was the man, although the old gentleman, with his enormous bulk, and soft, broad-brimmed white hat, was always much more in evidence, and was always quite ready to annex all the credit that was going. Once an acquaintance chaffed him. \"Tha never bred this,\" said the man, his hand on the broad back of the Kays' young bull. \" Tha ne'er had th' wit. It's thy Andrew.\" Old Kay, who was standing against the bull, ready to receive felicitations on its appearance, in his favourite attitude \u2014 leaning on his great stick, one leg a little forward, heel dug in the ground, toe occasionally lifted \u2014 turned his harvest-moon of a face slowly to the speaker, and said, with withering yet restrained contempt : \" An' who bred Andrew ? \" It was the bon-mot of the afternoon. So when 'Liza Lee and Andrew Kay met to speak for the first time, it was quite natural that Andrew should feel nothing new. But it happened that 'Liza did. She opened her blue eyes im mensely as she looked up into the brown face, rather"], [100, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 88 lean, but with clear red under the brown, and easy, unself-conscious power in it. All the rest of that day 'Liza went about her work with a curious expression on her face \u2014 the expression of one who has \"seen something.\" She was not inclined to dream over her occupations \u2014 rather there was a touch of feverishness in her usual energy. She must do, and do, and do. But what ? Something there was to be done, and it was hovering near ; but as yet it kept turning to her the edges of its wings. In the evening she went down to Thrutchden to do some marketing, and catching sight of the contents-bill, outside a newsagent's shop, of a Magazine for Women, she went straight in and bought one. And when she went to bed that night she took an unused candle in her pocket, and studied the thing with the seriousness and simplicity of one consulting a work of reference. It did not seem to deal, however, with persons in her sphere of life. She missed no opportunity of acquiring information. One evening Eva Barlow, from the next farm but two, came to see her \u2014 a miss of about eighteen. As soon as the first duties of hospitality were fulfilled, and the two girls were getting comfortable together, 'Liza said : \" 'An yo' a young man ? \" \" Aa,\" said Eva. \"'An most lasses about 'ere ?\" said 'Liza."], [101, "'LIZA LEE'S METHOD. 89 \"Yay,\" said Eva, \"when they getten owd enough.\" Then the conversation turned on other things for a little while. Afterwards 'Liza said : \" 'Ow did yo' start wi' yourn ? \" Eva looked at her with some amusement. But 'Liza's face expressed such a frank and simple desire for information, that Eva fell into an embarrassment when she came to discover how little of it she had really to give. She laughed a little, stumbling laugh. \" Eh, a curn't tell,\" she said. \" Like as we geet walkin' out.\" \" Andrew Kay's a nice young man,\" said 'Liza. Eva looked at her. \" Goodness gracious ! \" she thought; \" speaking of Andrew Kay like that ! As if he were one of a ruck from which she could pick ! \" The truth being that every girl on that side would have given the nose off her face for Andrew Kay, in spite of the fact that, as Eva had stated, they most of them already had sweethearts. They plucked the fruit within reach, and were duly thankful, even content ; for the golden pippin there at the top of the tree seemed so equally out of the reach of all that the jealousy of none was excited, and the very impossibility of getting it comforted them. But if it had shown signs of falling ? Things would have been different. When, therefore, 'Liza said, \"Andrew"], [102, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 90 Kay's a nice young man,\" in the tone of one going through a number of them, out of which she might decide to take him, Eva felt absolutely shocked. She felt that her friend was in that painful state of ignorance which leads to such falls as angels may avoid by the negation of valour. \" There's a good many as thinks that,\" she said with dry emphasis. \" 'E's owd enough to geet wed,\" said 'Liza, with the air of putting another fact into the scale for him. This flabbergasted Miss Barlow, and she gave up trying to rescue her friend from the inevitable slump. She became absent-minded ; indeed, all her thoughts were occupied in arranging the tale for relation to her cronies as soon as she could get to them. Before long she found an excuse, and went It is difficult to decide whether 'Liza's case was a case of atavism to a time when primitive man, less troubled and tamed by perception of the complexity of things, was accustomed to want little, but to want it very much, and, unable to perceive any reason why he should not, to proceed to try to get it obliviously of any other consideration than getting it and getting it quickly ; or whether it was simply a case of unusual inexperience and isolation acting on a mind exceedingly frank and direct by nature. The thing certain is this\u2014 that the woman in her had"], [103, "'LIZA LEE'S METHOD. 91 slept up to the time of the removal to Nab Close Farm. When she got there it awakened, saw what it wanted, and saw no reason whatever why it shouldn't have it. After dinner on Sundays, in the summer, Andrew Kay liked to smoke a pipe in his clean shirt-sleeves about the farmyard and the adjacent parts of the lane. He was doing this one fine Sunday shortly after the above-related conversation between Eva Barlow and 'Liza, when a figure came tripping down the lane towards him, in its Sunday best, from the direction of Nab Close. It was 'Liza. Andrew stood still. \" Well, 'Liza,\" he said, when she came up His attitude and tone showed him quite willing to gossip a little with this pleasant-looking, gaily decked little maiden. 'Liza stopped. \" How do ? \" she said, in a little voice. Then, looking as if she were making a proposition con ventional in itself, though new to her, she said, *' Shall us goo awalkin' ? \" Andrew opened his eyes at this. Said in a spirit of chaff, it would have been quite in the run of Combeworth conversation ; but 'Liza was either serious or had an uncommonly deep method in badinage. His continued investigation of the up turned face brought him to the conclusion that she"], [104, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 92 was serious, and, being quite unable to find anything else to say, he said simply, \" Aa ; but a mun geet my coat first.\" Then turned and went into the house, and soon reappeared in the act of donning the black and shiny garment. They walked slowly down the lane between banks topped with holly, the slopes sometimes cushioned with bilberry, sometimes crested with gorse, or here and there a little ling, and then again bracken or briers and honeysuckle. Andrew had certainly lost his easy manner; while 'Liza's face wore a solemn expression like that of a child at a ceremony. They went in silence. Andrew felt that, under the circum stances, it did not devolve upon him to open the conversation ; that seemed clearly 'Liza's part, and she might have some explanation to give. 'Liza, however, seemed satisfied that all was being done that was necessary, and made no sign. So at last Andrew looked at her with some curiosity, and said, \" Dun yo' laake walking aht ? \" \" It's t' first taam,\" said 'Liza. \" First taam as tha's walked aht ? \" queried Andrew, surprised. \" Aa,\" said 'Liza \u2014 \" wi' a young man.\" Andrew turned upon her a grin meant to be appreciative of a quiz ; but 'Liza's smile in response was perfectly simple. \" What taam an' yo' to be awhom ? \" said"], [105, "'LIZA LEE'S METHOD. 93 Andrew, after a time, with that change of tone which follows a ruminative silence. \" Fower o'clock.\" \" We mun be shappin', then.\" They turned homewards. Andrew, tired of trying to understand his companion, was on the brink of feeling foolish and vexed. He withdrew into his shell. 'Liza, for her part, had never seemed to consider conversation necessary. As they approached the Kays' farm, however, they passed by a field in the occupation of the Lees. Julius Lee had a cow of which he made a boast. She was in this field, and Andrew, catching sight of her, stopped to look, and then made an inquiry as to her yield of milk and its quality. 'Liza answered him as seriously and intelligently as a man. Andrew asked more questions, and received always the same direct answers, which began to be supplemented with unasked-for explanations, clear, interesting. The young farmer became quite absorbed, and when they found themselves at the Lees' gate he felt a shock like waking suddenly in a warm bed, which let him know how interested he had been. \" Will yo' come in ? \" said 'Liza. \"Nay, a It's welly baggin' taam at our 'ouse. They'll 'ardly know what to think, thank yo'. A think a mun goo this taam.\" With which he put out his hand, gave 'Liza's a"], [106, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 94 shake \u2014 this was an unusual demonstration \u2014 and turned and went rather suddenly. They were both left with a slight feeling of dissatisfaction, their artistic sense or feeling for symmetry not being entirely pleased with their leave-taking or rounding off of themselves on each other. On the following Sunday afternoon Andrew turned into the yard with his pipe, as usual; but his mother looked up as he went out, feeling a difference in him. Then it struck her what it was ; he had his coat on. He had put it on behind a cloud, or rather his objective self had gone behind a cloud and put it on, while his subjective self was occupied (it dimly saw through the cloud the performance of its objective partner) with an undefined feeling of something to be completed, into which sailed a pair of blue eyes, wide open, steady, looking straight into his with the single, disinterested desire of understanding his question. Then he let them swim away, to be replaced by grins and quizzical fleers, expressions of opinion appearing on the faces of some of his ac quaintances. He had welcomed them as tonic, but found the dose unbracing, and quickly becoming nauseous. He expired it in a cloud of smoke, and even spat. His coat was on. It made him feel as if he were going somewhere. Where ? Sunday-school? Thirty-one years old next time. His mother would like him to get wed. Plenty of time. He had laughed at her for it. Wrong. He saw now that, by"], [107, "'LIZA LEE'S METHOD. 95 remaining single, he was unkindly starving part of her nature. She was getting on in years, and wanted to see and touch her grandchildren. He had looked into the shippon, gazed at the chickens without seeing them, paused at the pig-stye, and was now in the lane. He turned towards Nab Close. No bright maiden appeared in answer to his incantation. Wasn't she a bit queer ? Bold ? Not she ; only extra straight. A very rare thing among girls \u2014 here a wise look came on his face. There were folk that might call her a bit peculiar-like. She'd all her wits, though. She knew a beast like a man \u2014 and so sensible ! His objective side was meanwhile taking him toward the Lees' farm. Why not ? said the subjective side on making the discovery. It seemed his turn, and honourable-like, that to-day he should walk in that direction. 'Liza was in the garden in front of the house. She had on her best hat, and, as it proved, a pair of kid gloves in her pocket. When she saw Andrew, she came up to the gate to meet him. And, having saluted each other by saying \" How do ? \" and smiling, they stood one on each side of the gate, experiencing some discomfort. Andrew looked round, but a subject for conversation was for the moment denied him. He might have invited 'Liza to come for a walk, but, sunk in the effort to make conversation, he did not think of the simple and natural thing to do. 'Liza, however, was thinking of"], [108, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES, 96 nothing else, and, finding things at a stand, had no hesitation in speaking. \" Are yo' for walkin' ? \" she said. \" Aa,\" said Andrew. There are several sounds used in Combeworth to express assent. The one attempted to be represented by \" Aa \" is spoken with a falling intonation, and in sense is unemphatic, yet complete ; unemphatic to express the speaker's anxiety not to appear to over estimate the value of his assent to the proposition in question or any other, complete in expressing the speaker's unreserved acquiescence. 'Liza came out of the garden and commenced to put on her gloves. They walked upward this time towards the rough moorland of the top. Soon they stood in a sea of bilberry, from russet to ruddy, from old gold to apple green ; amongst it the cotton grass lifted a myriad snow-white tufts, shaking in the fresh westerly airs; here and there the millstone grit showed hoary through, lest you should forget the solemnity of the hills in the beauty of their summer robing. Below them lay the southern plain of Lancashire, with its reservoirs gleaming like silver, its smoke - clouds brooding over hideous towns, incubating painful yet priceless lessons, its churches standing out on knoll and knob, its park-like survival of woodlands. \" Wheer's Manchester ? \" said 'Liza."], [109, "'LIZA LEE'S METHOD. 97 \" O'er yon,\" said Andrew, pointing. \" My mother were wed theer, at th' owd church,\" said 'Liza. They turned and went westwards, facing the hills, till soon they were alone with the winds and the sky and the quiescent moorland. Then it was that Andrew felt a thrill. He looked down at 'Liza; 'Liza looked up at him with a smile. In circles where conversation is practised for its own sake, and people are under the oppression of feeling a constant necessity for saying something, able or unable, the art of smiling is lost. Modern smiling, like modern art, has ceased to have unself-conscious beauty. If the smiler has nothing to say, the smile cannot conceal the struggle which is proceeding beneath it ; if the smiler has something to say, then the smile is spoilt by being required to adapt itself to words. Unknown to such is the smile of pure pleasure, untroubled by the slightest desire to eke itself out with speech, the frank, confiding, complete, expressive, shining, come to-stay, without - the - slightest - doubt - of - myself because-I'm-not-consciously-thinking-of-myself smile. But this was the smile of 'Liza. It flowed out to Andrew's heart, and enveloped it like sweet waters. He replied to it in kind, but less liberally, as might be expected from the difference in their natures ; and they walked on, gathering happiness with every step. H"], [110, "98 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. The right atmosphere was established \u2014 balmy, lumi nous-hazy ; and each felt that it was homogeneous, and enveloped both equally, and they were satisfied. After they had walked thus a long time, the silence broken only by the pipits, 'Liza, with a sudden cry, stooped to gather something which grew at the edge of the pathway, almost beneath a wave of the bilberry-sea which seemed about to break over the grassy depression. In another moment she had risen, and was holding up to Andrew, with the brightest face that ever had a startled expression on it, a sprig of white heather. Andrew looked at it; and then at the girl, as fresh and pure as the white flowerets themselves. \" That's a sign as tha'll be wed i' less than twelve month,\" he said, almost severely. \" Aa,\" said 'Liza, looking down. \" 'An yo' picked yer mon ? \" \" Aa,\" said 'Liza, looking up. \" Well, a'll feight 'im ! \" said Andrew. \" Tha couldn't lick 'im, an' 'e couldn't lick thee,\" said 'Liza, with something of the quaint pomp and mystery of propounding a riddle. \" A'm not such a very good guesser,\" said Andrew ; \" a could laake yo' to tell me plain.\" \" A thowt o' thee,\" said 'Liza. \" If yo'n a mind,\" she added, with rustic politeness. \" Yigh ; a'n a mind,\" said Andrew."], [111, "THE JEWELLED CHRIST. By C. EDWARDES. I. Sal Brabbins had wandered far from her dismal home. She had seen the faces of many strange \" coppers,\" none of whom had suspected her. And she had done pretty well into the bargain. In the pockets of her knickerbockers \u2014 for, sad to say, she was attired as a boy \u2014 were two purses and a silk handkerchief. She didn't know how much money the purses contained, but she felt sure there was enough to secure her from the walloping that was her due when she returned home empty-handed. The handkerchief, too, was a \" good 'un \" \u2014 one of the old-fashioned kind, soft, voluminous, and weighty. She had got that from a serene, elderly gentleman while he was gaping over some books at the window of a \" second-hand \" shop. And now, in her weariness, Sal found herself near a church porch. A bell was ringing, and people H 2"], [112, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 100 were entering the church. She could see the lights inside \u2014 tiers of them ; a gorgeous, dazzling display. She stood aside in the shadow and watched the folks. Some were beautifully dressed ladies, who rustled as they passed her. They exhaled sweet perfumes, too. Sal sniffed the perfumes and enjoyed them. To do her justice, she had not meant to pilfer from any of these worshippers. But the temptation presented itself, and in less than a moment she was another handkerchief the better. The lady carried it in a sort of side-pocket stuck on to her jacket. The thing tickled Sal's very face. It wasn't likely she could let it go by. Hardly had she bagged it, when she felt a hand laid upon her shoulder. Up she started, ready to run for her life. But the hand held her, just where her bones gave it a firm hold. \" I'm not doin' nothin',\" she said stoutly. Her captor was only one of the brethren of the Monastery of the Holy Cross. The church belonged to the monastery. As it happened, it was Brother Justin, who would not willingly have hurt a fly on the hottest of days. He smiled on Sal. His fingers seemed to hold her coaxingly. \" You were sitting there, my lad,\" he said ; \" and that is doing something, isn't it? \" Sal did not answer. She was looking oddly at"], [113, "THE JEWELLED CHRIST. 101 this smooth-faced, kind-eyed young man in the strange black gown. She did not feel the least bit afraid of him now. Her blue eyes had just that ex pression which, once caught, had procured for her the mocking alias of the \" Angel,\" Levi Lane way. To Levi Lane it was a rapturous joke that a kid like the Angel should be a subtle little thief. \" Suppose you come to church,\" suggested Brother Justin. \" What for ? \" asked Sal boldly. \"To praise God for creating you, and to ask Him to forgive you your sins.\" \" What's ' sins ' ? \" Brother Justin's smile left his lips. He seemed to draw a deep breath. Then he put his hand in his pocket and took out a shilling. \" Come with me, and you shall have this,\" he said, quite tenderly. Sal opened her palm. \" Afterwards,\" said Brother Justin, smiling again. \" No kiddin' ? \" inquired Sal. \" Won't you trust me ? \" Sal thought a bit, again closely scrutinised Brother Justin, and said she would. Whereupon the young monk took her by the hand and led her inside. She resisted briefly once she was past the door ; but wonderment and much else now had her for their own, and so she allowed Brother Justin to take her"], [114, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 102 past the fine ladies (including the one whose pocket she had picked), and eventually motion her to a chair by a little chapel, where the lights were not so dazzling, but whence she could see all the magnifi cence of the altar. \"Remember \u2014 afterwards ! \" Brother Justin whis pered once more, with an earnest look. Then he left her. What followed moved Sal's soul as it had never yet been moved. She sat still all the time, with her sly small hands folded on her knickerbockered knees. Even when the singing of the little boys in scarlet and white made her cry (she couldn't tell why), she did not stir. She kept her eyes fastened on them, and the severe-looking brethren, and the officiating priests, and the coruscating altar, and felt \" summat orful.\" It was over at last. Sal and all the others had been solemnly blessed. The boys, priests, and brethren had marched away in procession. The congregation also were leaving. \" Am I to go ? \" she said to the sacristan, who was near. But before he could tell her that she was to wait for Brother Justin, the monk himself reappeared, smiled, and offered her the shilling. For the first time in her life she didn't seem to care for a shilling. The tears were still in her eyes."], [115, "THE JEWELLED CHRIST. 103 \" Take it, my dear boy,\" urged Brother Justin. Then she took it without a word of thanks. \"And now I'm going to show you something else,\" said the monk. He held out his hand. Sal put hers into it \u2014 did not hesitate an instant. \" The treasury,\" he whispered to the sacristan, who, if he felt surprise, did not show any. They passed into the choir, and came to an iron door in the wall on the north side of the altar. This door the sacristan opened with a key, both he and Brother Justin, to Sal's amazement, dropping on their knees when the heavy iron door was swung on its hinges. Then, very reverently, Brother Justin took from the recess a cross of gold about a foot long, on a golden pedestal. There was an ivory figure of Christ on the cross. Diamonds and rubies sparkled from the cross, and a big emerald glowed in the middle of the rounded pedestal. The nails in the feet and hands of the Christ had diamond heads. \" Kiss it,\" said Brother Justin simply. Sal stared and asked : \" Wnich part ? \" Brother Justin lightly touched the side of the Christ where a wound was represented. \" There ! \" he said. This time Sal obeyed. She thought the cool ivory was rather nice to the lips. Otherwise she"], [116, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES, 104 did not think much about it, except that it was a \" rum go.\" This done, Brother Justin replaced the cross, knelt again, and signed to the sacristan to lock the door. Again he offered his hand to Sal, who again put hers in it. He led her down the aisle. This was fast darkening. The altar candles were all out but two or three, and .so were most of the other lights. One or two persons were to be seen on their knees ; that was all. By the door Sal's head brushed against a rope. \" What's that ? \" she exclaimed, almost as if afraid. \" The bell, my boy,\" said Brother Justin. Then he stopped. London was outside, with its pockets to be picked, and Levi Lane. \" Good-bye,\" said Brother Justin calmly, yet with a certain sadness. \" Good-bye, my dear boy. And sin no more.\" He pressed Sal's small moist palm hard, and left her alone. About two hours later the \" Angel \" turned up in Levi Lane. She got a walloping for being late, in spite of the purses. But she didn't seem to mind it. She was wondering why Brother Justin hadn't called a \" copper \" and given her into custody ; for she felt as sure as sure could be that he had seen her lift that last handkerchief from the lady's pocket. That night Sal dreamed of the jewelled Christ."], [117, "THE JEWELLED CHRIST. 105 ii. The next day Sal went out on business with a vague reluctance. She felt that she would be made to smart in the evening ; nor was her presentiment belied by events. Instead of picking and stealing, she merely roamed about, looking at things, with her hands fast in her own pockets. She spent an hour in trying to find the church of the previous evening; failed; descended to the river, and sat swinging her diminutive legs on the edge of a wharf. Here she was startled by the sight of a golden cross in the water ; looked again, and saw that it was only a bar of reflected sunshine cleft by a luminous wave made by a barge. Then she got up and rambled off. She was still rambling when the sun set. By this time she was very weary, and thought of Levi Lane. If only she could slink into the house, and up into the attic, and there glide under the blanket without being seen ! But, on the other hand, she was hungry. And so she decided to take her chance. Mother Gudge did the walloping. Iron Bill looked on with indifference, and Belial made jocular remarks. She got no supper either. Subsequently, she cried herself to sleep, and yet once more dreamed of the jewelled Christ. It was even finer in her dreams than in reality."], [118, "106 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. Meanwhile, Belial and Iron Bill made plans for the morrow. When daylight stole into her attic, Sal stood erect, and prepared for an industrious day. She decided that she would make amends for her blamable negligence of yesterday. But it was not to be. Mother Gudge detained her. Belial and Iron Bill were busy overhauling tools. Then Sal understood it was to be another night job. \" What you've got to do, ' Angel,' \" said Iron Bill, at one time, \" is shameful easy. Up comes the grating; pop you go into it; out you creeps the other side ; you feels your way along to the door, slips the bolt, and there you are. Them bolts oughter be abolished by Act o' Parleyment. Life 'ud be smooth if it wasn't for the durned things.\" Sal listened, and nodded her head. She hadn't the angel-look just then. She hadn't even been washed and made into the semblance of a respectable little School Board boy. Truth to tell, she felt phlegmatic. That, however, was just the state of mind best befitting a nocturnal adventure. Ex perience had taught her this much. Belial and Iron Bill sent her out three times for beer. Barring these trips (one of which was en livened by a challenge to fight from another girl child of Levi Lane \u2014 challenge declined), Sal stayed indoors. She peeled potatoes and listened to Belial's"], [119, "THE JEWELLED CHRIST. 107 language, which was worthy of his name. Mother Gudge stirred her up with kicks and playful flips with the back of her hand \u2014 a rare bony one. This, however, was nothing out of the common. Sal did not resent it. But it was a long day, and she was glad at candle-time. Two dips burned to their fatty extremities ere Mother Gudge seized Sal by an ear, and vigorously plunged her head into cold water. This was to freshen her for the night. Belial and Iron Bill were already as \"fresh\" as fresh could be \u2014 consistently always with a proper exercise of the faculties their avocation demanded. They were in great spirits. From what Sal could gather, it was to be a real good thing. She hoped she would give satisfaction. The memory of the lazy yesterday stayed with her reproachfully. Lanterns, jemmies, and the other requisites were then carefully pocketed by the men. Sal was put into her knickerbockers. Belial swung off by him self, with a decent blue handkerchief containing victuals \u2014 a model railway porter. After an interval,. Iron Bill, with his cord breeches twitched below the knee, like a navvy, also clumped down the stairs \\. with Sal following. Your honest workman makes a sounding noise at each footfall in the street. Bill's felts were in his pockets. At Bill's request Sal whistled as they trod"], [120, "108 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. the pavement hand-in-hand, and especially when \" coppers \" had to be passed. Whistling was one of her various little accomplishments. It was a dark, sultry night. The street lamps burned without a flicker. Bill said he would prefer some atmospheric excitement. But ere they came to their bourne, with Belial close at hand, he was cursing the lightning. This had set in with regular flashes. There was no thunder audible. The Fates seemed unkind to Belial and Iron Bill. Sal's eyes were the first to sight Belial. They were then near a church, with a black blot of trees on one side of it, and only one lamp. The lamp was ill trimmed. Sal ought to have recognised the church, but she did not. She was preoccupied with Belial. Her heart beat somewhat fast. It was always so at such a time, for she quite understood what a lot depended on her. The three joined company by a buttress of the church, as far as possible from the lamp. But for the lightning they would hardly have seen each other's faces. Near them was a circular iron plug in the ground, about sixteen inches across. Belial knew all about such things, and attacked it academically. Iron Bill, still holding Sal's hand, led the child along by the church wall till they came to a small door. \" That's it,\" he said."], [121, "THE JEWELLED CHRIST. 109 Then back to the plug, which was now a hole instead. With the celerity of genius, Sal was lowered, feet foremost, into the abyss. Her shoulders just passed. She let herself drop heroically when she was all in except her hands. It was a vile sensation; but she had learnt the utility of faith as an aid to works, good or evil. Just before she let go, the lightning illumined her. Belial saw her upturned face, with the angel-look on it. Fear and resolution did not mate so badly with the absurd innocence in her eyes. He damned the lightning, and said, \" Get ! \" Then he replaced the plug. Sal was hurt a bit by the fall, but more by the awful darkness. It was the latter that set her groping almost frenziedly. Suppose the cellar door was shut ! Her little heart almost thumped out of her body at the thought. But it was not shut. Out she came into the cool building, and breathed with gladness. Her soul was in her work. Pit-a-pat went her feet along the flags, with the chairs on one side. Echo went with her, and brightened her eyes. And once the lightning flamed in, and showed her a plaster figure of blue and gold, set against a column,. with a plaster nimbus about its head. So to the door. Here there were two bolts, one high, one low. Sal had to use a chair to reach the"], [122, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 110 upper one. She was as quick as the lightning itself. Then she tapped. The door opened and shut. Belial had joined her. Iron Bill kept discreet guard outside. \" Not bad, my Angel ! \" said Belial. It must have been very good to elicit such praise from such a man. Sal felt quite proud. There was a red lamp hanging in the church, a long way from the door. Thither Belial now moved, with Sal at his heels. The child remembered the same kind of lamp in that other church. Then she trod on a grating in the aisle, and made a clatter, and remembered that the same thing had happened when she was following Brother Justin between the sweet-scented ladies, towards the sparkling, candle lit altar. \" Churches is all alike, ain't 'um ? \" she asked of Belial. But Belial bade her hold her jaw, or And Sal shuddered instead of pressing for the information. Belial was a man of his word sometimes. They came to the choir, and Sal was more than ever convinced that one church is just like another. The same two steps up, and the same altar. This she could see dimly by the light of the red lamp. The gilded flourishes to the woodwork and the very arrangement of the candlesticks were the same. Then, if Belial did not stop by the wall, where"], [123, "THE JEWELLED CHRIST. 111 there was a little iron door like the one Brother Justin and the sacristan had opened for her \u2014 for her, Sal Brabbins, and no one else ! Sal's heart set-to and beat furiously. She breathed so audibly, too, that Belial turned and apostrophised her. \" Hullo ! What are you a-staring like that for ? \" he exclaimed, the next moment. \" There's never not another cross like that 'un he made me kiss ! \" Sal answered, wide-eyed. Belial chortled, and again got to work. He felt quite amiable. It would be a mighty good haul ; and how smoothly everything had gone, so far ! The door was nothing of an obstacle to a man like Belial, and tools like his. Sal was still staring at it, and shaking from head to foot, when Belial thrust in his hand and took out the jewelled Christ. The diamonds glowed in the gloom. But Sal's faith in the uniformity of churches and their contents was now uprooted. Body and soul, she flung herself in opposition to Belial. \" You leave that be ! \" she cried. She snatched at the arm of him which held the cross. This seemed to be sparkling everywhere, filling the circumambient air with jewelled scintil lations. Belial's jaw slid as he turned on Sal. \u25a0 Bli' me ! \" he ejaculated."], [124, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 112 \" Put it back where it was, I tell yer ! \" continued the girl, convulsed with mysterious anger. The red lamp near shone on a face Belial had not seen before. The face daunted him for a moment. But he soon recovered himself, grinned, used some exuberant language, and prepared to stow the booty in a canvas bag. Then Sal remembered something else. She gave Belial such a look, turned, and ran down the aisle. It was a long way, but she reached it at length. The next instant the church-bell rang as it had probably never yet been rung. Sal hung on to the rope and pulled. How long she would have continued to pull it there is no knowing, if Belial had not come up to her, spawning oaths. He grasped her with one hand, and with the other crashed his jemmy on to her head once, twice, thrice ! Then down she fell, giving the cord one final pull. The lightning flickered in just in time to see the last of her angel-looks. Some twenty minutes later there was a small crowd in the church, with tapers and varied ex pressions on their tongues. Two policemen were there. At one time there had been five, but three were now accompanying Belial to the district station. It was too bad of Iron Bill to make himself scarce"], [125, "THE JEWELLED CHRIST. 113 just when he was wanted to open unto his iniquitous brother in crime. Belial nearly lost his senses \u2014 what with the closed door, the killing of little Sal after the safe capture of the cross, and the playful fluttering of the yellow lightning on Sal's red-stained, upturned face. But he revived some of them in time to hide himself when the wonder-struck monks stole into the church by ones and twos from a door near the altar. It was no good, though. He had blood on the soles of his slippered feet. The brethren and the con stables tracked him to his corner, among the hassocks and brooms, as neatly as could be. There was a short, hearty struggle, and then they secured him, with the jewelled Christ clutched in his dastardly hands. It was only by degrees that the monks could piece the drama. Some were disappointed. They hoped the bell had been rung miraculously. But so was not Brother Justin, whose eyes lost all their drowsiness when he recognised little Sal. He drew the Superior aside, and told him what he knew. Then they both came and looked reverently at Sal, whom a neighbouring doctor had just declared quite dead. \" He shall lie in the church, since he has, under God, been the instrument of its salvation from out rage,\" said the Superior. i"], [126, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 114 But first they carried her into the monastery, the lightning still colouring her off and on with its gold. At nine o'clock, when the 'buses on the main road, not a hundred yards from the monastery, were heavy with clerks and their newspapers, little Sal lay in fair state in the church she had saved. They had plaited a white lily between her waxen fingers, which had done for ever with picking and stealing. And by her knelt Brother Justin, very strangely agitated. \" Mother of God,\" he prayed, \" intercede for this thy lamb, who gave her life for thy honour 1 \" While he prayed, it seemed to him that the dead face was illumined supernaturally ; but it was only the sun, which had superseded the lightning, and now shone suddenly on the Angel.

We were promised, I remember reading, that in the dim future men would relieve women in the kitchen.

But you know how very difficult it is to change a fashion. I would wear long skirts to-morrow if I were not afraid of being mobbed in the streets, and perhaps taken up by the police. Aunt Gladys. Well, then, when you have succeeded in wearing the old garb of female servitude, what next ? Posthuma. Oh, we have our programme. Of course, our main object is the abatement of the present misogyny of men and their well-founded antipathy to our aggressive and overbearing manners. We must educate ourselves into modest behaviour in order to overcome their natural aloofness. As a beginning we are going to re-establish chaperons."], [138, "126 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. Indeed, we are thinking of following the good example of the New York girls, who have long ago insisted upon two chaperons to every girl.

Any thing, you know, to make men less diffident and our own sex less forward and opiniative; but that, of course, will be rather difficult, for so many gentlemen these last few years have taken the veil \u2014 I mean the tonsure \u2014 and joined anti-marriage brotherhoods, that there is almost no one left to teach us the art of conversation with the weaker sex. Aunt Gladys. Do you mean to say that you modern girls don't know how to flirt ? POSTHUMA. Certainly I do. And whose fault is it ? Since the great schism between the sexes in the end of the last century there have been almost no men left to talk to. I myself hardly ever speak to any man except the postman, the policeman on the nearest beat, and an occasional male cab person. Aunt Gladys. Cab person? POSTHUMA. Yes, there are as many women as men on the cab ranks now \u2014 you must have seen them at the station \u2014 and the dignity of our sex, it seems, won't allow their being hailed as \" cabbies.\" \" Cab woman\" won't do, of course, so we have to call them cab persons.

Aunt Gladys. And the navy ? POSTHUMA. I thought every one knew that the whole naval service \u2014 from admiral to midshipman \u2014 had become Knights of Malta, and you know what that means.

(Sadly) They, too, now wear the white flower of celibate lives. (A pause.) Have I convinced you, aunt, that your new departure has plunged us girls into the most dismal existence imaginable ? Aunt Gladys. You have persuaded me that men are the most unamiable and intractable of created beings. Have you any more reforms ? POSTHUMA. We are abolishing some games which men won't play at any more since women took them up ; golf, for instance, and cricket and football, particularly since women insisted on playing cricket with india-rubber balls, and football in their old ball shoes. My committee think of prohibiting croquet, spillikins, and cat's-cradle to men, but we are divided on this point. They are, poor souls, so devoted to these games, since women gave them up, and make such heavy books, particularly on spillikins and cat's cradle, that we fear they might resent legislation on the subject, and sulk, and so undo all our efforts at reconciliation."], [141, "THE NEWER WOMAN. 129 Aunt Gladys. Men are radically frivolous. You had better leave them to their own silly pastimes. POSTHUMA. It would be kinder \u2014 poor things ! A still more radical proposition is again to throw open the Houses of Parliament and the legal and medical professions to men ; but even if we can over come men's natural diffidence, and induce them to enter public life, it will always be a work of time to educate men up to such responsible positions. Apart from all which, old women, at present, so abound in both Houses and on the bench, that we could hold out no immediate chances to the men, even if they could fit themselves for the work. Aunt Gladys. Well, dear, it does seem a duller world for you girls than I fancied. POSTHUMA. You see, Aunt Gladys, you had the fun of reforming the world, breaking down the old conventions, and of hoping for a newer, brighter, happier life.

Casually inquiring at the little inn where I had been lunching whether any one in that somewhat remote part of the world had anything in the nature of a story that was worth hearing, I had, as a natural consequence, been advised to call on Biddy West, at Myrtle Cottage. I found the cottage at once. Only for a moment did I doubt which it might be \u2014 there were so many cottages with myrtle in their gardens.

McMillan. James Lee was a most respectable man. He was perfectly at home in the ten commandments, and kept them to a comma. He was enlightened, too, and women whose husbands did not believe in the intellectual advancement of the sex, whom he took down to dinner at suburban parties, envied Mrs. Lee, and wondered she did not care to go out with her husband. In dress he was irreproachable : his shirt front was always a shirt-front, and never a badly inflated balloon. As an after-dinner speaker, he was happy, and his little volume of essays entitled, \" By the Way and Otherwise,\" gave him just a suspicion of the glamour of authorship. At twenty-three, being in the receipt of an income of James had taken unto himself one Sylvia Moore to wife, and had said to her, \" Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\" Sylvia, seventeen, an orphan, penniless, with careless guardians, pretty,"], [167, "PETRUCHIO REDIVIVUS 155 with a peach-like bloom, soft gray eyes, and masses of waving dark hair, fresh from a boarding-school with its dreams of an earthly paradise, followed James into his suburban villa and took up life's burden. There, in the course of the next seventeen years, were born eight children, the youngest a puny thing living but to die in an hour. During these years Sylvia's life had been one long task. The yearly income was still and James was the only member of that household who felt it enough. Sylvia had made and mended, brought the children into the world and kept them quiet ; had cooked, washed, and was responsible for the perfection of her hus band's linen. At thirty-four she was no longer a beauty. The peach-like cheeks were sallow, the gray eyes less soft and bright, the once rounded figure was lean and angular, and the dark hair was now gray. In return for this her husband had given her his name, food, clothes sometimes, hard words often, and of course he had made her the mother of his children. Good times, companionship, sympathy, laughter, books, music, and sunshine, were for other women. Sylvia was no fool, and many a long night, as she trod the nursery with the perpetual baby, she had pondered over the inequality of the sexes in a mar riage such as hers, and had asked herself a thousand times if the names \" wife \" and \" mother \" were an"], [168, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 156 adequate return for the pangs, the monotony, the loneliness, hardship, and utter weariness of her life. Many a time she owned that, all unwittingly, she had sold herself for a mess of uncommonly thin and bitter pottage, and felt that in a woman's penniless ness and dependence lies the secret of her endurance. At thirty-four, then, came her first breathing-space. The two eldest boys, now sixteen and fifteen, had already gone out into the world, and a cheap board ing-school had been found for the eldest girl. The last baby, too, was dead, and Sylvia had time now to sit by the fire of an evening, sew leisurely, and think much. So she sat one evening, ever and again casting glances at her husband, who sat opposite, looking languidly at the evening paper, preparatory to going off to his own particular sitting-room, the drawing room of the house. \" What are you staring at ? \" he demanded, catch ing her eyes fixed on him. \" I was merely wondering,\" she said slowly and meditatively, and not replying to his question, \" if men are really entitled to the best of everything.\" \" Don't be a fool if you can help it ! \" he said witheringly, and expecting to see her subside, as she usually did.

Mr. Lee bridled, puffed himself out, and then, seeing an unusual look in his wife's eyes, disguised his feelings in a fit of coughing. \" She wants you to go there to dinner on Monday next,\" Sylvia went on. \" I don't think I have any engagement that evening ; no, I have not. Did she say who is to be there ? \" Sylvia's heart beat a shade faster. \" I only know one other ! \" \" And that is \" \"Myself\" \u2014 quietly. \"You! You !\" he cried. \"Yes, I,\" returned his wife. \"Mrs. Brownlow, as she always does, said, ' I suppose it's no use asking you ? I wish we could tempt you.' ' You can,' said I ; ' I shall be delighted.' \" Sylvia looked at her husband, who returned her look with consternation. \" I am sure she doesn't want you,\" he said bluntly.

He did not understand Sylvia in this mood. \"Then surely you will never think of going where I am not welcome.\" \" Kindly leave me out of the question. I am different. You know you hate going out.\" \" Well, you have always said so,\" said Sylvia ; \" but then, as I have never tried it, I have formed no opinion on the subject.\" \" But I do not want you to go. I shall be seriously displeased if you think of it,\" said her husband, losing his temper. \" Well, you know, James, once that threat would have had weight with me ; but now However, if you can give me one satisfactory reason why you don't want me to go, I may reconsider the matter,\" said Sylvia lightly. \" I don't wish it : that ought to be enough.\" \" No reason at all. Why don't you wish it ? \" \" I will never condescend to argument with you \" \u25a0loftily. \" That means you have nothing to say.

But really, if you shout like that, Sarah will hear you !\" And Sylvia took a book from her work-table and opened it. \" Men have sometimes murdered their wives for less.\" \"Don't, James ! Melodrama does not suit you \u2014 you are too respectable.\" There was a brief pause. \" See if my fire is bright,\" he said presently, trying to gather a shred of authority. \" Ring and ask Sarah. I am tired.\" James was completely nonplussed. This was a new Sylvia, and he did not admire her. What did she mean ?; \" I know I have been weak about her,\" he said, as he withdrew with what dignity he could ; \" but I was not prepared for this.\" Meanwhile Sylvia, left by the breakfast-room fire, was trembling at her own temerity. Like James, she did not recognise herself in this woman who spoke so glibly on her own behalf. Many a time in her married life had such thoughts and such words trembled on her lips, and had been stayed by sheer dread of the consequences. Now, somehow, probably"], [172, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 160 because her physical health was better, she felt com pelled to assert herself. A sudden longing for the youth that had been so brief, and for the freedom that she never had had, filled her heart. It was as though the smoky blackbirds piping to each other amongst the short-lived buds of the suburban gardens were so many voices calling her to be young again. She felt, too, that her interview with her husband had touched on the borders of tragedy, and now she half smiled as the commonplace pushed the tragic aside. What could she wear at the party ? Evening gowns had not come into her domestic economy. The few pretty things she had had on her marriage had devolved on the children. She turned over in her mind the contents of a shabby old purse, where lay her slender savings, and felt she might allow herself two pounds for dress on the great occa sion. She had grown handy with her needle, and she knew a little dressmaker who would help her. This grave question settled, Sylvia moved about the room, tidying and arranging things. Presently she stood in front of the faded, battered cottage piano. She looked from it to the music cabinet, full of dusty, old-fashioned music. With listless singers she turned over the yellow pages, and read her own name, \" Sylvia Moore,\" in a half-childish hand, here and there. This she played at the breaking-up party at Christmas, and that at Midsummer. There was"], [173, "PETRUCHIO REDIVIVUS. 161 * Sweethearts.\" She remembered a favourite school fellow giving it to her on her sixteenth birthday ; and she remembered, too, how in the days of her brief engagement she had sung it softly to herself, and thought tenderly of James Lee. Could she sing it now ? With a timid hand she opened the little piano and set the music before her. Would her voice come ? Since her marriage it had only crooned lullabies. Tremblingly she tried the symphony. How stiff her fingers were ! How did it go ? When she began to sing, her voice frightened her \u2014 it was so hoarse and strange. She dropped her face in her hands, and the next moment tears would have glittered on the yellow keys. She straightened herself up when the door opened. \" Sylvia, understand once and for all, the house must be kept perfectly quiet when I am in it. At night, at least, there can be no necessity to indulge in these hideous noises.\" \" I am sorry if I disturb you, James ; but I don't see how you can reasonably object to my keeping up my music, when you have so often told Mrs. Brown low that married women owe a duty to society, and should keep their accomplishments from growing rusty,\" and she turned to the piano. \" ' Give me a flower, dear love', said he'' \" Sylvia ! \" \" He spake with a tearful sigh.\" M"], [174, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 162 \" Sylvia ! do you hear me ? \" \" That day he was going across the sea\" James came striding to her side. \"There must be no more of this ! \" \"And tliis was his last good-bye.\" James seized the music. \" I will not suffer this ! \" he said furiously. \" I am afraid Mrs. Brownlow has too high an opinion of you, James. She said to-day what she liked about you was your equable temper,\" said Sylvia provokingly. James swallowed audibly six times. \" I shall lock the piano ! \" he said, beginning to bluster. \" Not to-night, anyhow, as the key has been lost since Freddy swallowed it ten years ago.\" A word of one syllable, the banging of the door, was her husband's reply. \" I don't think Mrs. Brownlow would think that dignified,\" said Sylvia. II. Early on Monday afternoon Sylvia shut herself up to make her grand toilet. She and the little dress maker had contrived quite a presentable garment, of a soft gray material, cheap, but lending itself to graceful folds, and with just a touch of pink round the slightly open bodice. It was her fancy to dress without once looking into the mirror, so, until she"], [175, "PETRUCHIO REDIVIVUS. 163 stood complete, she had no idea what a success she was. Excitement had recalled for a time her peach like bloom ; her eyes had again grown soft, and even her fast-graying hair was becoming. As she gazed at the unwonted picture she made, she felt that her lost youth had come back. One thing spoilt her satisfaction in her appearance. Her cloak was old and shabby, and had seen much service amongst the babies. Ah, well ! that could not be helped. Wrapping it round her, she went to the nursery to speak to the children, and then, with a half-guilty feeling, went down to the breakfast-room to await her husband's return. During the past week that gentleman had done little but ruminate on the situation, which had not been alluded to by either, and to-day he had decided on the master-stroke. Directly he came home, he sought his wife in the breakfast-room. \" I have just called at Mrs. Brownlow's,\" he said, with ill-concealed triumph, \" to tell her that neither of us can join her this evening.\" \" You have done what ? \" \" I have told Mrs. Brownlow not to expect either of us to-night. Of course, even you will not think of going now,\" he added, as she did not speak. \" No, oh no ; at least, not there,\" said Sylvia, so quietly that she astonished herself and disgusted her husband. \"But, as we have at least part of the m 2"], [176, "164 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. evening before us, I think we may spend it not unprofitably here.\" She threw off her cloak and seated herself. James looked at her. He had been prepared for a row, tears, recrimination, and, indeed, as he was primed for a fight, a reception like this put him sadly out of his reckoning. However, his turn would come later. \" I must have something to eat,\" was all he said. \" Please tell Sarah,\" said Sylvia. \" I don't think there is anything nice in the house. I dined as usual with the children at one, and we had boiled mutton. If Sarah hasn't eaten it, there should be a little bit left. That and some tea will do, as, no doubt, you intend to join Mrs. Brownlow's party later; and she is always so careful of your comfort.\" He pulled the bell sharply. \" Sarah, please bring the cold mutton and some tea for Mr. Lee.\" James was livid. Till the distinctly frugal meal was placed on the table, nothing more was said. Sylvia came to the table and poured out a cup of tea for her husband. Her heart beat quickly, and she shivered as she did so; for she knew that after to-night life was not to be the same to her, and she realised that the moment had come when she must declare herself free, or for ever hold her peace."], [177, "PETRUCHIO REDIVIVUS. 165 \" Yes,\" she said presently, as if in reply to some thing he had said ; \" the time has come for a little plain speaking between you and me, not as husband and wife, but as man and woman \u2014 a very different thing.\" James affected to select a piece of mutton with extreme care. \"You have, Mrs. Brownlow tells me, a pretty taste in history, and I want you to look over mine with me.\" Sylvia spoke quite easily and dispassionately now, as if she was stating the affairs of some one else. \" As you know,\" she proceeded, \" I was seventeen when you married me. I regarded you then, and for a week or two, as a god. I thought you, also for a week or two, the wisest and the best of men, and, if a trifle selfish, not more than a man should be.\" James did not relish the glance his wife gave him. \"Don't let us have much more of this damned nonsense ! \" he said. \" I can remember yet how frightened I was the first time you swore at me,\" said Sylvia. \" What a goose I must have been ! I believe, funny as it seems, if I had sworn at you, you would have re spected me more. But that's only a parenthesis.

It was through determination, dogged, dauntless determination, sleep less, avid watching of opportunity, that he had done it. His thinking stopped with a jerk. Lately, amid the lionising, the feasting, the adulation that he had enjoyed, and so keenly enjoyed, that annoying question, that haunting doubt of his, had not been worrying him quite so much. He began to feel sure that it was merely a fancy, an hallucination, a sort of instinctive distrust of so immense a piece of good fortune. The door opened gently, and his servant entered. \" There's a man downstairs, sir,\" he began hesitatingly, a vague uneasiness in voice and look. \" He's been here two or three times lately, wanting to see you.

Then a light of half-angry remembrance gleamed in the heavy-lidded eyes of the V.C. \" Oh, it's you, McCarthy ! \" he said shortly. \" In trouble again, I suppose ? \" \" Oh ! in trouble again, sir,\" the other answered, almost humorously, in his rich, guttural brogue \u2014 the brogue of the West of Ireland. \" Sure, I'm used to it.

Yet the whole scene \u2014 the whole vivid, sparkling scene of a \"ladies' dinner\" \u2014 was one eager tribute to him. From the table, perfect in every detail \u2014 in the gleaming richness of its shining linen, the grace of its delicate glass, the antique quaintness of its silver and ivory; in the masses of fragrance and colour that were fruits and flowers ; in the wines, glowing and glittering in the golden lamplight : from all this, to the gay circle of guests \u2014 the men, in their brilliant various-hued uniforms ; the women in their shimmering satins and bright lustrous silks, their jewels and laces, with their perfumed fans waving in a bewilderment of soft, rustling movement ; the whole scene was one eager tribute to the man who now stood in the place of honour, with a face on which the most superficial glance could not fail to detect the strange overwhelming misery !

They were two of Dysart's companions. \" I say, Mervyn, look at Dysart ! \" said the younger man. \" What on earth makes him look so deucedly ashamed of himself? \" But at last Dysart spoke.

I USED at one time to live in a quiet London street, and in a corner house, the windows of which exactly faced a tolerably well-frequented crossing. It is amusing to look out from a first-floor window and watch a crossing, and the people who pass over it. There is a good deal of what it is the fashion to call human comedy always going forward there, and a man may look on quite as safe from observation as if he were a spectator at a real play in the stage-box of a theatre. The passers-by look up the street and down for coming carriages, or to the ground to pick their way between the two little swept-up walls of mud on each side of them ; or they hurry on to pass the sweeper without a tip, while he keeps just in front of them, executing a rapid pantomimic re sweeping of the already well-swept path. The sweeper at my crossing is a very good one as sweepers go. He is not a fair-weather worker, and sticks to his post even in rain and snow. He happens"], [214, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES 202 to be an old friend of mine, and was, as I well remember, the smartest trooper in my company. Since then things have altered for the worse with both of us. He lost a leg in action, and retired on a pension. I retired, too, with both legs, but with gout badly in one of them. His face has got terribly weather-beaten, and his hair gray. Mine has not yet whitened permanently, but my complexion is warmer than it used to be, and my tailor pads my coats and waistcoats without any express orders from me. I don't like to see an old soldier on the streets and doing what is little better than begging his bread \u2014 touching his hat all the day long to all comers, and getting coppers half in charity from morning till night. It is derogatory. \" Phil,\" I said to him one day, \" a soldier who has followed the Queen's colours into action might do better than this.\" \"Jineral,\" he replied, \"I like my freedom; and the trade is a good trade.\" I could have got him entered into the Corps of Commissionaires, or tried for a porter's place for him somewhere, for the man is sober and honest ; but he preferred his own work and his own way. My outlook upon Phil Kegan's crossing was the occasion of my once seeing out a little bit of that same human comedy I was talking about. It hardly amounts to a story, but it made me laugh at the"], [215, "TWO BEGGARS. 203 time. I have never mentioned the thing till this moment. When I left my old regiment I left in it a young fellow who had just joined, and who had brought good introductions to me. I did not see my way to do more for him than give him plenty of good advice, all of which he required, and none of which he took. I told him that if he kept four hunters on .\u00a3500 a year and his pay, he must inevitably come to grief ; that guinea pool with better players than himself, heavy books on a dozen sporting events in the twelve months, and some three or four other pleasant vices, would help rapidly to the same result. He thanked me, went his own way, and very soon came to the grief I had anticipated. He was sold up, after a military career of only four or five years. A good humoured fellow; and every one pitied him ! He had never done anything that could possibly be called shady, but met the onslaught of his justly exasperated creditors like a man \u2014 not running under bare poles for Boulogne harbour, as so many gentlemen in dis tress do, but making complete shipwreck of his fortunes like an honest man. He never left the country at all, but added one more to that legion of extraordinary beings who have nothing to do, who pass ten months of the year in London, and who live well, dress well, and look happy on absolutely nothing at all. He waited for something to turn up,"], [216, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 204 and he waited in vain. I don't think that there was a prison governorship, or the post of chief constable anywhere, or an inspectorship of almost any kind vacant during ten years, that Frank Boldero did not apply for. He always made good running, too, and never, as he used to tell us, lost by more than a neck; but he did lose, and remained a highly ornamental member of the aforesaid legion of the unemployed and the penniless. Boldero and I have always been good friends. I still give him good advice, he still smokes my cigars. He is the only man I know who ventures to walk up to a particular drawer, open a particular box, and take out a Cabana of a particular brand without leave. There is a placid impertinence about the proceeding, and about Boldero generally, which rather takes me, though I am supposed to be rather a short-tempered man. \" Confound your impertinence, sir ! \" I say, when I have watched him through this performance. Boldero half smokes through his cigar sometimes before he answers .me, after a good look at the white ash, and waving the cigar slowly under his nose to catch the aroma, \" General, don't run out of this brand ; I like it.\" One sees at once the sort of man Boldero is \u2014 a lazy, imperturbable kind of fellow, who takes all that comes to him as his right ; never did a day's work at anything since he was at school, and lectures every"], [217, "TWO BEGGARS. 205 one all round on their duties. That is the most try ing thing about Boldero. He never does a thing himself, and wonders why his neighbours work no harder. \" Hang the fellow ! Why doesn't he stick to his work?\" I have heard him say of some barrister or literary man with his hands as full of business as they can hold. If I did not know Boldero personally, and any one described him to me exactly as he is \u2014 told me what his life had been and how he had wasted it, how he had had good chances and thrown them away, a fair fortune and lost that, and now how he went on coolly laying down the law for other people \u2014 I should be indignant at the thought that such an idle, good-for-nothing impostor should cumber the earth. But the truth is, it is rather difficult not to like the man. His manner is on his side ; he has a queer way of keeping up a pleasant smile on his face while he talks, while he is uttering some signal impertinence probably, and it makes it quite impossible to be offended with him, or to take him up as he deserves to be. \" Why did you retire, General ? \" he said to me one day. \" Eh ? \" \"Because I chose,\" I growl out. But Boldero is not to be snubbed. \"But you had no business to choose. Your duty was to stay. Who is to lead us if we have to fight the Russians ? \" All this with a sweet smile."], [218, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 206 I groan. \" You should have heard what a lot of us were saying yesterday at the Club. All the fellows agreed that you were the right man.\" \" Confound them all for a set of asses ! \" He shakes his head, and his smile still lingers on his face. Never in my life have I come across sueh a mixture of amiability and impertinence. One rainy day in November, Boldero and I were looking out of the window together. He was waiting to keep one of his numerous appointments with ministers and other people high in office. There was an inspectorship vacant, and he was looking after it. Phil Kegan was working double tides that day in the cold sleet and drizzle, running backwards and forwards with every well-dressed foot-passenger, touching his hat innumerable times, escorting old ladies and children, waving back cabs and carriages from his charges \u2014 sweeping, talking, bowing, all at once. \" Look at that poor devil,\" said Boldero, \"begging for his bread \u2014 it's an infernal life, eh ? \" \" It's his own choice, after all.\" \" Some fellows won't do an honest hard day's work if you pay them for it.\" \" Hang it all ! The work's hard enough and honest enough.\" \" Well, I don't know about hard, but it's begging.\" \" I tell you what, Boldero,\" I say, a little out of"], [219, "TWO BEGGARS. 207 patience with him, \"it may be begging, but that fellow Phil has done more real work in the ten minutes we have looked at him than you have since I knew you.\" Boldero smiled and shook his head. He never takes in this sort of personal argument, and presently he borrowed an umbrella, and walked off to keep his appointment. I watched him over the crossing. I saw him stop in the rain (with my umbrella over his head) and talk to Phil Kegan, as he very often did, for the man had been his servant in the regiment ; but he did not, as he generally did, tip him. On the contrary, he buttoned up his coat rather ostentatiously, shaking his head the while. I guessed that poor Phil was getting a lecture on his duties. In about two hours Boldero came back. He had told me he would look in to say how he got on. I never saw him so \" down \" before. He slid into an arm-chair in a very limp attitude without a word, and his hat slid too, in a dejected way, to the back of his head. \" Well ? \" I asked. \" Lost by a head again, and the very place I wanted \u2014 comfortable, fair pay, a house, coals and candles, very little work \u2014 none to speak of. Damn it all ! Isn't it enough to make a man swear ? \" There was no smiling about Boldero this time. Then he told me how it had happened."], [220, "208 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. \" The old fellow, you know, is sort of uncle by marriage, so I could speak pretty freely to him. I told him this made about the fifth inspectorship I had asked him or his predecessor for. ' 'Pon my soul,' I said to him, 'it's too bad ! ' but he didn't seem to see it. What claims had I got, he wanted to know, more than that I was always asking, and my friends were always asking for me. ' Well,' I said, ' what more do you want ? Doesn't Lord Button ask it as a special favour ? The Button influence is good influence, surely ? ' But he talked about my being an untried man. I might be fit, I might not be. Then there was Chub in the lists among others. Chub had worked all his life in that line. How could he refuse Chub ? Chub knew all about the work. There was no doubt about Chub's fitness. If he refused Chub there would be an outcry.\" \" Look here, Frank, old man,\" I said, interrupting him ; \" this won't do, you know. They don't mean to give you anything. Why should they ?

I know a bigger man than Lord Button, who tried at everything for his favourite nephew \u2014 a goodish man, too \u2014 and had to fall back upon a club secretaryship for him at last. If you want to turn an honest penny, Frank, you must work for it, and work hard.\""], [221, "TWO BEGGARS. 209 Boldero groaned, and collapsed still further into his chair. \"You make my blood run cold,\" he said. \" It's no good praying and begging for a good place and nothing to do. You won't get it, and you'll only feel mean. There's the press on the watch, and public opinion. Jobbery and nepotism, and all that, are gone things in these days.\" \" You bet they're not ! \" said Boldero, rousing up a little. \" Frank, my boy, there's just one chance for you \u2014 emigration. Scrape together what you have left, go to New Zealand, and join your brother there. They tell me he is making his pile.\" Boldero only shook his head. I was really sorry for him, he seemed so completely knocked over. \" Got any of those bitters left ? \" he asked, when I had finished my lecture. \" I think I want a pick-up.\" I rang for a glass of sherry bitters. Boldero rose from his chair, and sauntered half mechanically towards the drawer with the box of particular Cabanas, took one, lit it, and walked listlessly towards the window. We looked out together. The rain had stopped ; the wind had got up. It was a cheerless day. Phil Kegan had turned up his collar, and looked miserable. Still he worked on with a will. \" Poor devil ! \" said Boldero ; \" but he doesn't know what it is to have nothing to do, and nothing to look to. It's a nasty feeling, that, General.\" p"], [222, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 210 Wayfarers were getting scarcer. We watched an old lady with a pug come over the crossing ; a stout old gentleman with a gold-headed cane; a fishmonger's man with a tray of whitings ; a telegraph boy who rang at my door. My servant presently came in with the bitters and a telegram on a tray. The telegram was for Boldero. \" Boy came on from your club, sir,\" the man said, as he handed Boldero the telegram and wine glass together. He took the glass first, and drank slowly and critically. \" What bitters are those, General, eh ? \" \" Chiretta.\" \" I thought so. It's the best tonic going. Take a glass three times a day before meals. It'll wind you up like a clock. I shall try it myself, I think. I am just one peg low.\" \" Try quinine,\" I suggested.

I was uncommonly glad, I must say, and Boldero looked radiant. It seemed to pick him up a good deal more than the bitters. I shook hands with him, and hit him on the back as one does on these occasions. He did not say much, but I could see that a vision of the good house, the easy work, the coal and candles, was passing pleasantly through his mind. \" It suits me, you know,\" he said presently, with great seriousness. (i By Jove, sir, it suits me down to the ground ! \" Presently Boldero went off, but he came back before he got to the bottom of the stairs. \" I say, General, will you lend me a sov. ? \" I gave him a sovereign.

A TRADE contest was being fought, by the usual methods of passive and dogged resistance on either side, in one of the mining centres of the north. The masters called it a strike ; the men preferred the term \"lock-out,\" as if they wished thereby to throw the blame from their own shoulders. The matter had arisen over that bone of colliery contention \u2014 the deputies. These deputies are, as the name denotes, substitutes, or proxies, who see to the carrying out of the contract : and the pitmen held that they must belong to the Miners' Union as a necessary corollary to employment. At the very beginning of the fray the owners had frankly declared that they would not attempt to coerce their deputies, who should be left quite free to follow their own inclination ; and they had even consented, for the sake of averting the terrible suffering of a strike, to advise those deputies who had been members of the union, but had allowed"], [225, "A \"BLACKLEG.\" 213 their subscriptions to fall into arrears, to make up the deficit. More than this they could not with dignity do, especially as it was against their own interests, for there was not the same probability that a member would be as absolutely unbiassed as a free man. The miners would not respond, and had turned out to a man in support of what they considered a principle. They mistook for weakness what was only a wish to come to an understanding, and thought they had only to hold out a little to gain all they desired. They had not learnt, even by repeated experience, the nature of the men they had to deal with. The owners chiefly concerned were the two Godfreys, father and son, men of evenly-balanced temperaments, capable and self-reliant, with no superabundance of nerves. So long as they had hoped to come to an agreement, they had acted with moderation ; they had conceded every point that did not affect the main issue : on that they stood firm. The strike had lasted for only three weeks, but showed no signs of coming to a conclusion. The funds of the union had not run dry, and the men had not felt the pinch of hunger. But the Godfreys had begun to suffer sharply in seeing the irreparable damage that was daily occurring in their pits through want of proper attention. In one especially, known as the Low Pit, there was an inrush of water that threatened to swamp the workings altogether, unless"], [226, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 214 the pumps were kept steadily at work. And the problem of obtaining a sufficient number of men to work them was not easily solved. Even those who would not have been averse to earning a little money dare not earn with it the terrible sobriquet of \" black leg,\" which would bring wages of a different sort. John Godfrey, junior, felt contempt for what he considered the cowardice of the men, who dared not come forward. He had passed through life applying his own measure to all around him, levelling them up to himself, calling them cowards if their courage or readiness of resource did not equal his, without the least regard to their physical or mental equip ment in the battle of life. One cold evening he rode into the village. There was still light enough for a group of rough lads to continue an impromptu game of ball against the blank wall of a house. Otherwise the place was externally deserted. It was a time of question and comment ; the men liked to meet and add their quota of opinion or forcible asseveration ; and where so easy to meet as at the public-houses ? The county town lay only a mile distant; there they would be sure to hear the latest piece of bravado, and come home with a comfortable feeling that they were in the right, and that victory was within their grasp. Consequently, there was no one to notice Godfrey. The wind blew in gusts down the long, straggling"], [227, "A \"BLACKLEG.\" 215 street, and sent the grit and dust whirling about his face. He dismounted, and knocked on one of the doors with the handle of his whip. It opened immediately, and he could see that the front room, parlour and bedroom in one, was in darkness. The light of a dim oil-lamp fell through the intervening doorway from the kitchen beyond. There, at a wooden table, sat the father of the family in his shirt-sleeves. \" Can the lad hold my horse for a moment ? \" asked Godfrey. \" The lad's oot ; the lasses '11 dee it,\" answered the owner of the house, without stirring. Two thin, delicate-looking little girls had opened the door, and they now advanced from behind it, giggling timidly ; in fact, the inner room seemed full of them \u2014 there must have been seven at least, all white-faced, small-boned little creatures, but alive with fun and merriment. Their delicacy of appear- ance was evidently hereditary, for the father was a stunted, narrow-chested man, with a nipped-in face, and a pathetic old-before-his-time expression that never left his features. Godfrey knew him well by sight ; knew, too, that he did as good a day's work in the pit as all but the very strongest among the men, and had long ago made up his mind that looks counted for nothing, and practice may make a man equal to a Hercules. He never thought of seeking a"], [228, "216 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. deeper cause, and consequently never discovered the powerful motor, the father-love, that worked that small frame with a wearing and unceasing energy. \"The lad's oot; a' the rest is lasses,\" he repeated apologetically, as Godfrey strode forward and seated himself, with a nod to his wife. \" Eight of 'em we has.\" The visitor smiled, but began without preliminary on his errand : his time was precious. \" I came to speak to you on a matter of business, Thompson. You know we're trying to keep the Low Pit clear of water ? \" Thompson coughed nervously, as if he knew what was coming. \"The men object to our doing it, which is simple madness ; for if it's drowned out, there'll be four hundred or more of them thrown out of work when we do begin again.\" \" So I says to the missus myself.\" \" We need at the very least six for the work, in shifts,\" continued Godfrey, disregarding him. \"We have the overman and his two sons on, and we have imported two men.\" He paused, but Thompson did not speak. \" I want to know if you're willing to be the sixth. I know you don't belong to the union, and, with all these children to feed, you must be hard put to it.\" , Mrs. Thompson, a tall, thin, nervous woman, with"], [229, "A \"BLACKLEG.\" 217 high cheek-bones, had, until now, remained silent ; but her feelings were too much for her, and she broke in volubly. \" That's as true as gospel ! Mebbies ye doesna knaw, not bein' the father o' bairns yerself, what a sight o' bread and boots goes for a family like ourn, and him bein' off six weeks bad and a' ; and I ax yer how we could save ? It isna likely. He'd be right down glad of the job, sir, and thankin' you kindly for thinkin' on him, that is so be if he'd do it safely.\" \" Well, I'm making him the offer,\" said Godfrey, turning from her a trifle impatiently to Thompson, on whose brow a puckered frown had gathered. \" I dorsen't, sir, and shot's all aboot it,\" he said piteously. \" The danger would be very slight,\" said Godfrey. \" I shouldn't suggest your staying here, and walking to and fro every day. No, we would lodge you close by the shaft, where there are half a score of policemen on duty day and night.\" The poor man shook his head in feeble negation, and looked up at his wife, showing plainly by his face that he expected to be finally led by the dominant partner. \"Ay, bide at home,\" said she, with withering scorn. \" And then, mebbies, when we've all getten a perishment of cold and hunger, thoo'll wish thee'd done otherwise ! \""], [230, "218 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. Thompson moved uneasily. \" What'll I get ? \" he asked Godfrey. Godfrey told him. The terms were good beyond his utmost expec tation. \" I should arrange, if you like, that half or two thirds should be paid directly to Mrs. Thompson,\" he added, \" which would obviate any necessity for your coming home, or any of them going to you.\" Still there was no response, so Godfrey rose. He was annoyed. It was a matter of the utmost im portance that the pit should be kept clear, and Thompson was one of his last chances; but he was too proud to ask it as a favour. \" I have no wish to force you against your inclina tion,\" he said ; \" but you are a steady workman, and I thought you might be glad of the chance of making a little money.\" The father's heart smote him bitterly, and he rubbed his hands nervously together. \" It's not for myself,\" he said, rather huskily. \" It's for them. The lad only keeps hisself. If aught was to happen to me, what's to become o' this little lot ? \" \" It'd be for the bairns thoo'd dee it ! \" broke in Mrs. Thompson. \" Then there'd be a rag to pit on their backs, and a bit to pit i' their bellies, instead gannin' cryin' to school, as little 'Liza did yesterday,"], [231, "A \"BLACKLEG.\" 219 and the teacher askin' her, too ; one 'ud think shame to see thee sittin' there wi'out stirrin'. 'Tisn't for the bairns thoo stays ; 'tis for theesel', and that's what. Eh ! if the master 'ud try me, I'd show the mon the road ! \" As she spoke Godfrey's eyes wandered round the room and noted the ghastly bareness of it. All the little nicknacks to which he was accustomed in the houses of the pitmen were absent. There were no polished candlesticks on the mantelpiece, no staring monstrosities in the semblance of china dogs. The enamel roll, with a motto on it, was missing ; only one or two funeral cards in black frames, with white angels weeping over the tomb of a loved one, re mained \u2014 there had probably been no market for these. He felt impatient with the man, no longer for his own sake and for the ruin to the pit, but for the hunger his refusal entailed on the wife and children. \" I can assure you, Thompson,\" he said gravely, \" the risk will be of the very slightest. I would do \u2022the job myself if I had not other and more important work ; and I'm far more likely to be a marked man than you.\" He forgot, in speaking, the difference between his own vigorous, well-nourished frame, and that of the worn, prematurely old, young man before him. Thompson looked up suddenly."], [232, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 220 \" I'll be there ! \" he said. Godfrey was relieved. He would not be haunted by the vision of those unsatisfied faces any longer ; and the satisfactory pumping of the pit lifted a great load off his mind. It only remained to settle a few preliminaries as to time and work, before he left. This was soon done ; and as he went to the door he told Mrs. Thompson that an advance of wages should be hers on the morrow. Being manager and owner in one he was free to do as he pleased. The torrent of her gratitude overwhelmed him. As he took the reins from the child who held them his fingers touched hers, and he left half-a-crown in her hand. But the touch of that ice-cold, thin little hand was with him uncomfortably as he rode home. II. When the new recruit joined his mates at the Low Pit, he was received with a volley of chaff. The sturdy overman and his sons knew no fear, though they had been stoned from behind a wall more than once. They lived in the houses close under the great colliery outbuildings, and if they went beyond the shadow of police protection the consequences were on their own heads. Within that circle, however, all was very peaceful ; the strikers had not begun to feel the pinch of hunger yet, and had confined themselves"], [233, "A \"BLACKLEG.\" 221 to words only. And even their words were not heard here. This isolated spot seemed to be by itself in the world \u2014 cut completely off from all out side influences. Thompson was a useful ally, for he knew something of the job, and was quite ready to do all he could ; he had never been a shirker. The rough gaiety of his comrades inspired his timidity, and he grew more fearless under its influence as day by day passed, and he heard no threats of violence. He rejoiced in the thought of the comfort he was bringing to his home. He had been at the work for about a fortnight when an intense spirit of loneliness seized him sud denly and he longed to see his bairns once more. He had just come off duty, and was standing by himself in the great stillness of the gaunt colliery outbuildings. It was growing dusky, and the only sound was the gentle hiss of the steam from the boilers of the engine-house that worked the cage. Thompson's mate had relieved him at the work, and, after a minute's interval, there began again the smooth working of the levers, and the iron-strand rope ran out its length in the shaft on one side, as on the other the volume of water was drawn to the surface, and was poured out, to run away in a stream. Thompson stood at the top of the steps in a moment of indecision. One of the policemen on duty came abruptly round the corner below and hastened up the"], [234, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 222 tram-line to meet two men who were advancing. From his elevation at the top of the steps Thompson could see him meet them, and, after some altercation, turn them back. No one was allowed in the vicinity of the pit unless he came on business. When they went back the policeman vanished, threading his way among the piles of pit-timber and the intersecting cross-lines, and all was lonely again. There, among the shadows of the boilers, with the gentle hiss of the escaping steam in his ears, the yearning for those he loved grew deeper in the little man's soul. As it had been considered safer for the children not to come to him, and so to advertise the fact that he was working, he had not seen them once during the fortnight. Living in the silence of the dying colliery, he had heard no threats, nor the words spoken at the street corners which had re ference to himself. \" Mebbies he'll gan and ha' a look at his bairns, ef we bide oor time.\" \"Not he; he's too canny a blackleg; he'll bide aside the polis.\" At the best of times he had never been a popular man among his comrades, owing to a certain conscious ness of virtue, which in a higher rank would have been termed priggishness. He had never visited the public-house, chiefly because he had no money to spare; nor had he attended the rabbit-coursing"], [235, "A \"BLACKLEG.\" 223 matches so popular with the men; nor even betted. He had in large measure what is a form of pride with the poor, the desire to keep himself to himself. This was felt and resented. Besides, he was a dreary little man, without sufficient physical stamina to enjoy a joke. All his energy was demanded by the hard terms of mere living, and the pitmen love a humorous comrade. It was felt that Thompson con sidered himself superior, and many a man had done him a bad turn on the sly. His home was about two miles distant, and the way lay over a long, lonely road. It only passed through one village, partially deserted. This had once been a flourishing and prosperous place, but when the colliery, which had brought it into being,, had ceased work, most of the inhabitants had migrated to more flourishing quarters ; only a few remained, preferring to walk a mile or so to their daily work rather than have the trouble and worry of \" flitting.\" There was hardly likely to be any one standing about at this place who would recognise him. Besides, it was rapidly growing dark, and the road was very quiet. He began to meditate a flying visit homewards, to satisfy the child-hunger that stirred in his heart. He was free until the following morning. He could be back before twelve, and would have time for his night's rest then. He thought at first that he would ask one of the police-"], [236, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 224 men to accompany him, but he shrank sensitively at the imagination of the rude chaff such a request would evoke from his fellow-workers ; besides, the presence of the policemen might draw more attention to himself. It would be better to slip away quietly and say nothing. By the time they missed him he would be almost back again. He was grimy, but not especially so, for he had not been underground. He would lose no precious time in washing, but get his dinner and go. Having come to this resolution, he lost no more time, but went to the house where he lodged, and ate the dinner which had been provided for him, in silence. Then he went to the door, and squatted down before it, in the characteristic fashion of pitmen, until the coast should be clear. He lit his pipe, a short clay, and smoked indifferently while he imagined any one was watching him. At last all seemed safe, and he sauntered to the end of the row. That child hunger was dragging him out of safety. Once round the corner, out of sight of the houses, he breathed more freely. The way seemed clear. It lay at first between hedges, and then there was a short cut by a field-path. He avoided the path, going round the longer way to avoid a farmyard, where there might be people who would recognise him. Turning up his collar, and putting out the pipe, he trudged along."], [237, "A \"BLACKLEG.\" 225 His thoughts were all occupied by pleasant anticipa tions. He imagined the bairns clinging round his neck, and tbe shout of welcome they would give him. This love for his children was the very dominant note in Thompson's character. He was proud of the lad, but it was the little lasses who had entwined themselves into the very fibres of his heart. His love for his wife was of quite a different order. He had the greatest respect and admiration for her ; his love was reverential in character, and his repeated in junction to the children always took the form of \" Be good lasses, and dee as your mother tells ye ; \" or, \"Work at yer tasks, and mebbies ye'll grow oop as foine women as yer mother.\" Though he sometimes felt she was a little grimly hard on them, and pre vented even innocent amusements, he never openly expressed this insubordinate feeling, but always backed up her authority. Yet it was he who brought whatever brightness there was into those little lives ; he who humoured them and devised treats for them, to which she merely assented under protest. He was the companion, the friend, the playmate ; Mrs. Thompson, the disciplinarian. He had traversed about a mile of the road, and his hopes were growing brighter, when suddenly an awful thought occurred to him \u2014 he was taking nothing with him for the bairns. Rarely had he returned home, even from his work, without some Q"], [238, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 226 trifle. It might be only a flower from the hedgerow, or the impression of a fossil fern he had hewn out in his day's work ; but he had always some trifle to please them. Now he had nothing. He had plenty of money in his pocket, for he had just received his first instalment of wages ; but how could he invest it ? There was only one shop on the way ; it was among the houses of the deserted village mentioned above, and even as he remembered it he neared the place, and saw the dull gleam of the oil lamp shining behind the dirty glass bottles of sweets locally known as \" bullets,\" which stood in the un shuttered window. He drew near in an agony of indecision, fumbling in his pocket. He knew that he ran a terrible risk by going in, for recognition would surely follow, and it was only a chance that the man would be so inert as not to follow and bully him. However, he was nearly at his journey's end ; even if he were followed and taunted, it would not be for long. And then he remembered how the thin fingers at home would creep into his pockets in search of spoil. This decided him. He walked boldly in. A small boy seated on the floor gave a shout of \" Shop ! \" which was promptly answered by the appearance of a woman from the back room. She did not take any apparent notice of her customer, but served him without comment. She had left the door ajar behind her, and Thompson could see through the crack that"], [239, "A \"BLACKLEG.\" 227 her husband was seated by the fire within. He made his purchase, and was turning away, when he heard the man call, in a tone of suppressed excitement, to the boy, \" Ha, way, hinny ! \" and he caught a glimpse of his eager face as the lad ran to him. There was no doubt now that recognition had followed the rash proceeding, and Thompson left the shop with a sudden tremor. He hurried as much as he could, and had reached the last dark hill before he heard any warning sound. He was just beginning to imagine that he had escaped the consequences, when the noise of running footsteps came to his ears. His heart leaped into his mouth, for he was too nervous to have much physical courage. He started to run himself, for the lights of the village would be in sight after the turning at the foot of the hill ; and surely his enemies would not maltreat him in very sight of home ! But those murderous footsteps gained on his, and before he was aware that they were so close, he felt a terrific blow on the back of his head. He staggered with the force of it, and heard a voice, which he vaguely recognised, say roughly, \" We'll sarve thee oot, thee domned blackleg ! \" As he reeled, another man struck him on the face with doubled fist, and this second blow felled him to the ground. He had a confused notion that there were many men round him\u2014 more than two certainly, but all was vague and q 2"], [240, "228 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. indeterminate, for a red mist swam before his eyes. He moved feebly, making an attempt to rise, but a shower of kicks from heavy boots quieted him effectually. Since that first wrathful exclamation, the attack had taken place in silence ; but when the poor little man lay still for aver, one of his assailants, in a tone more of contempt than pity, remarked : \" He's varra small ! \""], [241, "A SUMMER EPISODE. By MRS. MURRAY HICKSON. I. They met for the first time last summer. Why Marie Wishart should have been attracted by him is one of those problems which must remain insoluble. Probably, even when her infatuation was at its height, she herself would have been at a loss to account for it ; but that does not alter the facts of the case, nor does it render the story in any way different from many more of the same character. The odd part about it was the absurd triviality upon which a woman's fate balanced and turned ; though that, I suppose, if we only knew it, is common enough also. However, perhaps there may be something a little out of the ordinary about this particular case, and certainly the woman's absolute lack of logic and consistency is, if not instructive, at any rate in teresting. That Tremaine should fall in love with Mrs. Wishart would have been, to any one acquainted"], [242, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 230 with them both, a foregone conclusion. In the first place, she was a married woman, and her husband was away \u2014 a position which rendered the pursuit of her at once fascinating and safe. She possessed also that curious shallow reserve which belongs generally to those women preferred, for the most part, by the opposite sex \u2014 that appearance of mystery which stimulates curiosity and keeps interest upon tiptoe. Because of these tricks of elusion she arrested and held the attention of those who met her. Besides, she was very pretty \u2014 almost beautiful ; and beauty, with Tremaine, formed an essential to his regard. His theory of womanhood, though complex in ex position, was simple enough in reality : women are meant for the gratification and amusement of men, and therefore, above all, they should be attractive to the eye. Marie Wishart was more than attractive ; she was fascinating, and she satisfied his artistic desires, mentally as well as physically. Also, she was, apparently, beyond his reach. Now, Lewis Tremaine was not a gentleman \u2014 a fact which, in spite of his handsome face and figure, was patent to everybody. Of course, he spoke and behaved correctly. A public school and 'Varsity education had moulded him into a fairly accurate copy of well-bred manhood ; but he was only a copy, after all, not the real thing; and the curious vulgarity of his mind showed itself in little ways which were"], [243, "A SUMMER EPISODE. 231 entirely beyond his understanding and cognisance. The odd thing is that they should have escaped Marie's notice ; but they did. I remember well the first time that I found him in her drawing-room. It was June, and a month of blue sky and sunshine. For many weeks not a drop of rain had fallen, and we had almost forgotten that, in England, we are sometimes obliged to carry an umbrella. The windows of Marie's pretty drawing room were thrown wide open ; beyond them one caught a glimpse of green and roses. The room was deliciously cool ; broad sun-blinds kept out the glare, and trails of honeysuckle, hanging on either side of them, framed the distance like a picture. Tremaine and his hostess sat together beside the tea table ; and the moment I looked at them I felt that mischief was in the air. Marie started up nervously to meet me ; Tremaine, with an outbreak of that vulgarity to which he is subject, rose languidly and shook hands with me as if my advent were an un pardonable bore. He was annoyed at my coming, and did not conceal his annoyance. I sat down and accepted tea and strawberries. Marie talked a great deal, and very fast. Her cheeks were flushed, her manner excited ; she looked beautiful, but restless. \" When did you return ? \" she asked. \" I had not expected to see you again so soon ! \" Then, without"], [244, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 232 allowing me a moment in which to reply, she turned eagerly to Tremaine. \" Mrs. Rochester is an old acquaintance of yours, I know ; her presence in Millingford will make your stay here a delightful one.\" Tremaine, who was lounging in a low chair beside me, looked up listlessly. His handsome eyes met mine with a mixture of insolence and appeal. \"Mrs. Rochester used once to call me 'friend,'\" he replied. \"Of late I have been unfortunate enough to displease her.\" The speech was a bold one. It challenged a frank encounter ; but I knew my man well, and considered my reply. I wanted to save Langley Wishart's wife from the dangers of this last piece of folly, and a quarrel with Tremaine would effectually prevent my shielding her. It was always impossible to influence Marie by any ordinary method. She glanced from one to the other of us ; her face full of sympathy for Tremaine, and indignation at the implied cruelty of my behaviour. I stretched out my hand to him across the small space which divided our chairs. \" That is in the past,\" said I ; \" let us call a truce, and begin afresh. Perhaps this time we may under stand each other better.\" Again his eyes met mine, and I smiled in voluntarily as I read in them the delightful and"], [245, "A SUMMER EPISODE. 233 wholly inextinguishable vanity of the man. In spite of my age (which really should have saved me from such a misconception), in spite of much former plain speaking, he put down my present tolerance to that attachment for himself which he believed no woman who had once known him could escape. The idea pleased him almost as much as it diverted me. \" Dear lady,\" he said, \" that is like yourself. I fear I have deserved your anger in the past, as much as in the future I hope to merit all your old \u2014 shall we say affection ? \" \" Oh yes,\" said I, \" by all means let us say affection.\" He would have kissed my hand, but I rescued it in time. It is true I had not taken off my gloves, but even so \" Considering that old affection, you gave me a sorry welcome just now,\" said I. \"You have been angry with me,\" he murmured, and I caught the look with which, at the same moment, he contrived to meet Mrs. Wishart's eyes. It was done in his best style, and, as a look, was inimitable. A previous knowledge of his methods made me recognise it as nothing short of masterly. I think Marie was puzzled and a good deal piqued by the under-current of meaning in our talk which she felt, but could not comprehend. Indeed, I own that this dialogue was rude ; but then, as I said before, Tremaine was not a gentleman, and for me, in this"], [246, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 234 instance, I thought the end justified the means. Still, in spite of my good intentions, I had the grace to feel a trifle ashamed of myself. \"You have not yet told me how you became acquainted,\" said I hastily, anxious to throw the con versation once more into the hands of my hostess. There was a slight pause. Each waited upon the other for a reply, but Tremaine left the answer, accord ing to his custom, with the woman. \" We met at the Fixbys' in town, some weeks ago. Mr. Tremaine told me that he knew you \" \" That I used to know her,\" interpolated Tremaine, with wistful humility. \"And I was delighted to make him welcome for your sake, as well as his own.\" \" Thank you very much,\" said I, with due gratitude as, rising abruptly, Marie proposed an adjournment to the garden. Now, were I so clever a woman as I am, at times, disposed to consider myself, I should have outstayed Tremaine at any cost to my dignity and self-respect, even at the cost of my dinner-hour, and of my hus band's consequent displeasure. But, owing to a foolish miscalculation, I contented myself with the lesser measure of carrying my opponent away with me upon my own departure ; and this, as I subsequently discovered, was a fatal error in generalship. The Wisharts' place is some way out of Millingford, and I"], [247, "A SUMMER EPISODE. 235 had plenty of time in which to cross swords with Tremaine, who, as the carriage swept along the narrow lanes, sat beside me, altogether at his ease. The sun shine, falling level through tall hedgerows, struck across his face, and shone into his dark, impenetrable eyes \u2014 those beautiful eyes, behind which lurked so pitiful and ignoble a soul. Certainly, if looks were everything, the man was handsome enough to explain any infatuation. But, in these days of refinement, mere beauty is not enough, and he lacked breeding in an intangible way too marked to be forgotten or overlooked. The sun dazzled me ; I put up my parasol \"Well, Mr. Tremaine,\" said I, \"it is interesting to meet you once more. I am glad that I happened to return before your visit to Millingford is ended. Tell me, are you here on business or on pleasure ? \" He stirred a little, and glanced in my direction. \" Dear lady, how can you ask ? When have I time or opportunity for any pleasure? I am even poorer than when first you knew me, and certain difficulties of which you are aware \" \"Ah ! yes,\" said I ; \"it was about those difficulties that I was thinking. And your engagement \u2014 for I heard in London that you were going to be married \u2014 does that stand ? She has money, I suppose?\" \" You are hard on me,\" he answered, with a sigh. \u25a0\" It is not a marriage of love. She is older than I"], [248, "236 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. am \u2014 much older than I like, in fact, and she is \" He paused, shrugging his shoulders. \" But it would be unmanly to complain. She is my fate. Mean while, since you are kind enough to ask, I am here for some time \u2014 on business.\" The horses went very fast; already we began to leave the cool, green country behind us. In the distance lines of stuccoed villas rose outlined against a hard blue sky ; on our right the smoke and haze of a big town hung upon the air. There was no time to dally with my subject. \"About Mrs. Wishart,\" I said. \"Does she know of your engagement ? \" He met my eyes. A smile lurked in his own \" Oh, yes ; she understands me better than you do,\" he answered. \" And the\u2014 the ' difficulties ' ? He looked reproachful. \" How could you think it ? So young a girl, so innocent, so full of trust and belief in all goodness ! You would not have me soil her beautiful soul ? That is not like you \u2014 at least, not like what I remember of you.\" It is not pleasant to be told, even by implication, that one is coarse-minded. I felt, to my dismay, that I was blushing. \" You are so much older than she is,\" he mur mured, with sudden effrontery. I shut my parasol with a jerk. \" Mr. Wishart,\" I"], [249, "A SUMMER EPISODE. 237 observed, \" is an old friend of mine and of my husband's. We should never have introduced you to his wife ; but, since you know her, I shall be sorry if she learns the truth about you. At the same time \" I paused significantly. The carriage clattered upon the stones in the first outlying streets of Millingford. Already we were passing the stuccoed villas, which, gaunt and hideous, flanked the roadway upon either side. Just in front of us a steam tram car waited for passengers. Tremaine held up his hand, as if to check my further speech. \" I give you my word of honour,\" he began. But I had heard of his word of honour before \u2014 a fact which we both remembered. He stopped suddenly. \" You won't believe me,\" he said. \" I know it. Well, never mind. You have the matter in your own hands ; you can tell her if you please ; and then \" \" Not unless I find it necessary,\" said I, relenting somewhat. \" You will not find it necessary. I have learnt a lesson since the days when you were good to me. And besides, my duty to my future wife \" \"Ah! yes,\" said I. \"I had forgotten her. Of course you cannot afford to lose so advantageous a connection.\""], [250, "238 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. He looked at me in mute reproach. \" Will you stop the carriage ? \" he said. \" My lodgings are near here.\" He got down, and, leaning over the door, uttered a last remonstrance. \" You are very, very hard on me, dear lady \" \"Oh, Mr. Tremaine, don't talk like that,\" said I impatiently. \" It is really absurd to insist upon all this pretence with me.\" I signed to the coachman that he might drive on. Tremaine stepped back to the pavement. He stood looking after the carriage till, turning a corner, I lost sight of his tall figure and uplifted hat. Now, no sooner had I done so than I began to doubt the wisdom of what I had said. Past expe rience told me that, where a pretty face was in ques tion, Tremaine would risk everything to gratify his fancy. If he really intended to make love to Marie Wishart, I saw no other means of stopping him than by telling her the whole truth about him. The tale was not an edifying one ; it would have been wiser, if less honest, not to have warned him of my inten tions, and, even after we were alone, to have kept up my pretended truce and friendliness. However, it was too late now, and I trusted that chance and I, between us, could save Marie from the annoyance of his further attentions. If the worst came to the worst, I should have to warn her; but I knew that"], [251, "A SUMMER EPISODE. 239 the task would be a difficult one, and I was not at all sure how she would take it. 11. A week later Marie Wishart came to luncheon. She had not been with me half an hour before I became aware that there was something on her mind \u2014something not unconnected with Lewis Tremaine. She was restless and preoccupied. No matter of what we spoke, the conversation kept shifting round in his direction. \" You have known him for a long time, Mrs. Rochester ? \" \" Yes ; for some years. Once we saw a great deal of him.\" \" But not latterly ? \" \" Not latterly.\" She played with the fruit upon her plate. \"Forgive me, but isn't that rather hard upon him ? \" I smiled. \" Has he sent you as ambassador, my dear ? \" She hastened to disclaim the office. \" Oh, no, Mrs. Rochester ; indeed not that. But I saw you knew each other very well, and I felt puzzled to account for several things you said. Mr."], [252, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 240 Tremaine is only an acquaintance of mine; but he interests me.\" \"Ah ! yes,\" said I ; \"he interests many people.\" She looked at me with an air of consideration. \"You speak bitterly. What has he done to lose your friendship ? He never mentions you except with warmest praise and gratitude.\" \" That is very kind of him. As for our disagree ment, did you not hear ? We made it up in your drawing-room.\" \"The truce sounded hollow,\" she answered, with discernment. \"Even so, it will serve his purpose,\" I rejoined, smiling. She finished her strawberries, and we went back again into the drawing-room. Marie is a brilliant pianist. She sat down at the piano, and played for a quarter of an hour, softly, dreamily. The room was cool, and full of the scent of flowers. I laid my head against the cushions of my chair, and, shutting my eyes luxuriously, began to doze. The music ceased suddenly, and Marie was kneeling beside me. \" Mrs. Rochester,\" she said, \" you are older than I am.\" \" I know it,\" said I, with a wry face. (After five and-thirty one does not care to be perpetually reminded of one's age.) \" What of it ? and what do you expect in consequence ? \""], [253, "A SUMMER EPISODE. 241 \" I want you to tell me about Mr. Tremaine,\" she said \u2014 \"all about him; everything about him. Yes ; no wonder you look astonished : I am astonished myself.\" She broke off abruptly and rose to her feet. No doubt she was right, and I did look astonished. Matters appeared to be coming to a crisis with even more than their usual rapidity, though, I remembered, Tremaine's love affairs seldom lagged by the way. I sat up in my chair and reviewed the position of affairs. Tremaine, I knew, had returned to London a couple of days earlier. I could hear a letter from him crackling in my pocket as I moved my skirts. But, I reflected, neither his absence nor his protes tations argued that he intended to abandon the campaign ; on the other hand, I knew that timely retreat often, with him, meant a renewed attack. Meantime here was Marie, pacing my drawing room, and behaving with anything but her usual coolness and reserve. With all my heart I wished that Langley Wishart were at home again. \" It is for Mr. Tremaine's sake that I ask,\" she said, pausing before me. \" He grieves over the lost friendship between you ; and I should like to think that, through me, you had learnt to understand and to forgive him \u2014 if, indeed, there be anything to forgive.\" \"My dear Marie,\" said I, \"you are very kind and good ; but I confess I feel rather bewildered.\" R"], [254, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 242 \"Why?\" she demanded impatiently. \" Well, I can understand your motives, but I must say that for once I fail to fathom Tremaine.\" I hesitated. I own I was interested. \" You are sure he did not ask you to make these inquiries ? \" She shook her head. \" I am only anxious that you should do him justice. You are so fascinating and good \" \u2014 here she sank gracefully upon a stool at my feet \u2014 \" that I think it a thousand pities he should lose you as a friend.\" I began to understand the charm which the girl exercises over those who come within her influence. Hitherto I had found her somewhat aloof and un approachable \u2014 at least to women. \" My dear,\" said I gratefully, \" it is very sweet and pretty of you to say so. But, Mr. Tremaine \u2014 Mr. Tremaine \" I was in doubt how far the whole truth might be wisely spoken. \" Well, what has he done so unpardonable ? \" she said swiftly. \" What more than most men ? In what part of his life has he not been more sinned against than sinning? \" Now this also should have warned me ; but I own I was off my guard. Marie's earnestness seemed genuine ; her peace of mind, I feared, was in danger. I yielded to that fatal desire for plain speech which is my worst enemy, and I told her the whole un-"], [255, "A SUMMER EPISODE. 243 varnished truth. She sat down and listened to me attentively, without a word of interruption. When I had finished, there was a momentary silence. I glanced at her, and knew instantly that I had made a mistake. My story was not a nice one, but it had had no effect upon her whatever. She looked at me coldly out of supercilious eyes ; all the coaxing softness had left her face. Marie did not care a bit about the \" difficulties \" (though, in truth, there were more than one of them). In a flash, I realised that, upon the whole, Tremaine's career was more interesting to her than repulsive. Some women are like that; they prefer a strong flavour in their love affairs ; it pleases at once their vanity and their sense of sham romanti cism. Had I remained cool and mysterious, I might have succeeded in rendering Marie afraid of Tremaine; but downright truth and warning were thrown away upon her. \" Well,\" she said, \" it is just as he told me \u2014 the same story ; only related in your way instead of in his. If you were just to him, Mrs. Rochester, you would own that in neither case is he the most to blame.\" \"Just as he told you ! \" cried I, in astonishment. \" You don't mean to say that he ! \" \"Yes. He did. You remember the day you came to tea last week ? Well, later in the evening he returned, and told me the story of his life.\" r 2"], [256, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 244 I was silent. I realised Tremaine telling the \" story of his life \" \u2014 in inverted commas ! The man's audacity was splendid. He feared my interposition, and had, therefore, by prompt confession, taken the sting out of possible revelations. \" Well,\" said I, recovering from my first stupefac tion, \" Tremaine is really a remarkable man. What a pity that I did not forestall him in this recital ! I certainly ought to have done so.\" \" He was right, then ? You meant to tell me ? \" \" Under certain circumstances, yes \" Marie rose. She stood looking down at me with an air of superiority. \" I thought so ; yet I could hardly believe it.\" \"You could hardly believe what?\" said I petulantly. \" That you would deliberately try to ruin his life here; to make him more unhappy than he is already; to drive him into a marriage which you know that he abhors.\" Really this was too ridiculous. \" You evidently,\" said I, \" do not understand the situation. Mr. Tremaine's confession to you was well done \u2014 excellently well done, and in his best style. Unfortunately, he has not been strictly accu rate as to facts. Now, I have. There are the two accounts \u2014 his and mine ; you must take which you prefer.\""], [257, "A SUMMER EPISODE 245 \" I prefer his. I believe it, and I shall accept it.\" \" Then, if one may ask, for what purpose did you beg of me just now to tell you all I knew about him ? \" She hesitated. \"You did it very nicely,\" I added, \"and I am bound to say I was unable to resist you.\" She smiled. A tribute to her fascinations was welcome from anybody \u2014 even from another woman. \" Well, you see, Mrs. Rochester, I wanted to hear if your story and his tallied.\" \" And as they do not ? \" She turned towards me with an air of mutinous rebellion. \" I prefer his ; and I believe it to be the true one.\" Again there was silence. A velvety bumble-bee flew under the raised sash and buzzed upon the window. From without, the faint sound of a scythe came to us through the distance. Hot sunshine flooded the garden and streamed across the pave ment of the verandah. \"I don't want to be rude,\" said Marie; \"but \"But you wish me to understand that you con sider me anything but a truthful person ? \" \" Oh, not that ! I only mean \u2014 I got up from my chair and stood beside her. The bumble-bee buzzed and whizzed itself out of the"], [258, "246 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. room. Mrs. Wishart looked in my face. Her eyes were hard, and she drew back a little as I laid my hand upon her shoulder. \" Now, listen to me,\" said I gravely. \" The man is a bad man, and a dangerous one. You are young and very pretty, and you are married to one of the best of men. Ah! yes; you may smile; but you know it as well as I do, only you will not take the trouble to realise it. Tremaine is different. He is not only selfish and vain, but mean \u2014 mean to the bottom of his heart. Don't, for the sake of a mere flirtation, don't do yourself and your husband the absurd injustice of supposing that you can be in love with such a person. If you do, you will certainly repent it. I hardly hope that words of mine can influence you ; but, at least, I have warned you.\" I loosed my hold upon her. She shrugged her shoulders as if to shake off my touch, then turned again to me, smiling. The antagonistic look faded out of her eyes ; she spoke gently, almost with affection. \" I am sure you mean it for the best, Mrs. Rochester. You have always been a kind friend to \u2014 my husband. But, while I assure you that the warning is not needed, I should like to say how sorry I feel for that much-maligned young man.\" She took up her gloves and parasol. \" And now I must be going. I have several calls to pay, and I want to"], [259, "A SUMMER EPISODE. 247 be at home before five o'clock.\" She looked at me with her head a little on one side. \" Mr. Tremaine is coming down from London, and I promised to give him some tea. By the way, won't you drive out and join us ? \" I declined with thanks \u2014 politely. What was the use of arguing with such a butterfly ? Then we kissed one another, and she went away. When my husband came home in the evening, he said that he thought I had made a muddle of the whole concern, which was no doubt quite true ; only I wonder what he would have done in my place ! III. After this the affair lagged somewhat, but towards the end of July I began to hear rumours on this side, rumours on that side, finally rumours on all sides together. Now, though this was just what I had an ticipated, yet the fulfilment of my expectations was none the pleasanter because I was prepared for it. And, moreover, I felt a certain sensation of respon sibility. Therefore, in extremity, I appealed for aid to my husband. \" He is your partner,\" I said, referring to Langley Wishart, \" and you can recall him. In fact, you must recall him, and that without delay.\""], [260, "248 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. My husband remonstrated \"But what am I to say to him?

When will you send the telegram ? \" My husband flicked the ash off his cigar. \" My dear wife, have you put the case clearly to her ? I can't help thinking that if you spoke out You women so seldom speak out, and therefore do not make each other understand.\" \" Oh, my lucidity is not to blame. The better her understanding, the deeper her infatuation. It is so with that type of woman.\" \" But have you told her ? \" \" I have told her everything, and without avail. When will you send the telegram ? \" \" But,\" he pleaded, \" if you are mistaken we shall look such fools, you and I. We cannot tell the man that we have suspected his wife causelessly ; and in short, my dear, I think we had better not meddle in Mrs. Wishart's affairs.\" When my husband speaks in that decided way I"], [261, "A SUMMER EPISODE. 249 know that merely verbal argument is useless. I tried another method of persuasion, with success. But, even in consenting, he stipulated, man-like, for delay. A week later I went up to London on a shopping expedition, and, on the following afternoon, found myself at King's Cross Station, with hardly a minute to spare before catching the 4.30 down train to Millingford. After the carriage door was slammed behind me, I did not, for the moment, realise who was to be my travelling companion. Then, as I turned to arrange the chaos of parcels which had fallen from my arms upon the cushion, I saw Mrs. Wishart sitting opposite to me. We greeted each other with more or less of cordiality. My mind was full of suspicion, and hers, I could see, of restless ness and agitation ; but the usages of good society prevailed, and for the first half-hour we talked trivialities. After that ensued a spell of silence, which I employed with a newspaper, and she in staring vacantly out of the opposite window. The country thereabouts is not interesting ; I don't think Marie Wishart found it so. As for me, my eyes wandered continually from the printed page to the human document before me \u2014 a document difficult to decipher, yet full of possibilities. I do not know by what impulse she broke the reserve between us, but presently she turned her"], [262, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 250 head and looked at me again. From behind the shelter of my newspaper I was conscious of her gaze. \" Mrs. Rochester,\" she said, \" have you sent for my husband ? If not, don't do so. It will not be necessary now.\" I dropped the paper into my lap, too much astonished for the amazed denial which I clearly ought to have given. My eyes met hers, and I felt my eyelids quiver. She nodded her charming head. \" Oh, yes ! I knew you would send for him sooner or later, and I meant to be beforehand with you. But that's all over now.\" Then, as I still remained silent : \"Don't you want to hear about it?\" she added. \" Don't you care to hear that I have been all in the wrong, you entirely in the right ? Don't you feel glad to know that I am now returning by the 4.30 express to the paths of peace and respectability, instead of crossing the Channel with Lewis Tre maine beside me, and unspeakable Bohemia in the near distance ? \" I cared to hear very much, but her manner jarred upon me. \"I'm not a man,\" said I sharply \u2014 \"only a woman who likes your husband, and is interested in you. Can't you drop these airs of the Je\u00bbime in comprise, and talk straight for once ? \""], [263, "A SUMMER EPISODE. 251 She smiled, and, changing her seat, took the one beside me. She was not, as I had expected, in the least offended ; therefore, for once, I had no need to cry out upon my plain speaking. \"You are quite right; it's more than half a pose,\" she said, with an air of delightful impartiality. \" One half pose, the other half because I really am Jemme incomprise \u2014 at any rate, by myself. I wonder why we modern women are so complex ; it's exceedingly inconvenient, to say the least of it.\" \" Oh, we are not more complex than our grand mothers,\" said I. \" We are only more aware of it, and a very great bore it is to every one but our individual selves. But, about yourself \u2014 are you not going to tell me ? \" \" That is just a part of the complexity I mean. And I am coming to the point immediately.\" She paused. Her eyes fell from mine to the floor. With the ferule of her dainty lace parasol she poked the cushions on the opposite seat. \" You know that I had heard about Mr. Tremaine's past life ? You told me yourself. So did he. All the time, though I tried not to believe it, I knew your version was the correct one. The facts against him were bad facts ; yet, all the same, I did not mind them.\" She lifted her eyes again. \" How do you account for that ? '* she asked me, still smiling. I shrugged my shoulders impatiently."], [264, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES, 252 \" How should I account for it ? Degeneration ; hysteria ; most likely pure perversity.\" We were flashing through the country at express speed. Our carriage swayed slightly from side to side. Hedges, trees, and fields rolled themselves away behind us, like a never-ending map uncurled along the line. \" Well,\" said Marie, \" but you had told me that Lewis Tremaine was mean. I did not believe you. Had I done so, I should have been saved some humiliation. As it is \" \u2014 the smile faded from her lips, she nodded her head gravely \u2014 \"you were quite right about my husband, Mrs. Rochester. He is a good man, as you said ; one of the best of men. At least, I have learnt that lesson.\" I was glad of it. But I was also curious. \" Well ; but about Tremaine ? \" \"Ah! yes. About Lewis Tremaine. You will probably cut me in suture, but I mean to tell you the truth. No doubt it is the only way to prevent you from sending for my husband ! \" \"Tell me nothing unless you wish,\" said I abruptly. \" I don't think my husband has yet re called Mr. Wishart.\" \" Oh ! I hope not,\" she exclaimed, with a flicker of alarm. \" But, if so, it cannot be helped, and I shall have to make a clean breast of it.\" She pondered for a moment. \" In any case, perhaps,"], [265, "A SUMMER EPISODE. 253 that will be best. What would you do in my place, I wonder ? \" \" Well, since I do not yet understand your posi tion, it is difficult for me to advise.\" \"Ah! to be sure. Well, I fancied myself des perately in love with Lewis Tremaine \u2014 I, who never before cared a jot for any man. Odd, isn't it ? \" \"Very. The whole thing appears odd to me.\" She looked at me reflectively. \" No doubt it does. I cannot for a moment imagine But that is of no consequence ; the fact remains that, as I said, for the first time in my life, I fancied myself in love. It must have been imagination, because now I am absolutely cured ; but at the time \" We drew clanking into a station \u2014 our first and last stoppage before reaching Millingford. Marie remained silent until, once more, we were speeding through the open country. No one had entered our compart ment ; we still had it to ourselves. \"At the time,\" she said, \"the infatuation was so strong that I was willing to sacrifice everything for it \u2014 my home, my life, my husband. Nothing checked me ; not your warnings, nor my own semi-conscious ness that the man I cared for was evil and trivial. \"ft sterday I met him in London, intending to cross with him to Paris ; and, after that, the Deluge ! But \" again she hesitated."], [266, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 254 I waited without comment. I felt sorry for her; but indignant at her heartless indifference towards her husband, who, if somewhat ordinary and middle aged, loved her dearly, and with a perfectly unselfish devotion. Why are such women as Marie Wishart able to win and to keep what better women \u2014 women purer, truer, yes, and cleverer, too \u2014 long and strive for all their lives in vain ? I wonder. It doesn't seem logical, and it doesn't seem fair. \" Well,\" said Marie, \" I met Lewis as we had arranged ; and the reason I did not go with him will sound as absurd in your ears as it does in mine. Yet it is the true reason. He asked me to lend him the money for our tickets ! That seemed to me odd. I remembered your warning about his meanness; mean ness is the one thing I find myself unable to pardon. I handed him my purse, and, while he went to the ticket office, I slipped out of the station. The rest was easy. My sister is in town, so I stayed with her.

He loved"], [267, "A SUMMER EPISODE. 255 me devotedly,\" she said, with an odd little air of satisfied remembrance. She had taken off her hat, and her soft hair curled about her forehead ; she looked sweetly pretty, but not in the least repentant or ashamed. And yet I laid my hand upon her slender fingers. \" In your place,\" said I, \" I should tell my hus band everything, and start afresh.\" She smiled again. \"Yes, I know you would. Perhaps I will tell him \u2014 that depends. But, in any case, there need be no starting afresh.

If you knew the whole truth in my case, perhaps you would judge me less hardly. The modern married woman is not the foolish or the vicious creature that you seem to imagine her \u2014 she is a philosopher, and she adapts herself to circum stances.

By BULKELEY CRESWELL. In all the intricate meshing of Nature's fabric human experience has told us of no joint nor seam save two. They lie where Inorganic meets Organic, and where Organic meets that which we still may only know as \" the Beyond.\" So it may be that where those lines of endings and beginnings join, they fall microscopi cally apart, or overlap, in places, and the great rule of Law and Destiny is shaken for an instant in its swift path. Once upon a time in the great City of Umbrellas, where the Plane trees are, and prosperity is measured by red granite and the gloss on men's hats, the violet light from a young girl's eyes found reflection in those of a young man. So they became engaged. There were, if one comes to consider it deeply, other reasons that this thing should fall. Mary's mouth was full in the lips, and drooped with plaintive, pathetic lines to the corners. The pretty"], [287, "HARLING'S DESTINY. 275 pouting merriment thus summoned to attend about her chin, and play at contrasts with her serious eyes, indicated for Harling that here was the one quantity needed to his perfecting ; the completing string to his broken lute ; the exact filling for him of the void that is by Nature in the soul of every man ; and this recognition set all his manhood wearying for her. Harling, too, when his hair-dresser treated him well, had a forelock that fell carelessly and caressingly over his right brow where thirty years had begun to glean his forehead of hair. His was a kindly fore head, though a bald one, and all the sympathy of Mary's womanhood centred in that drooping tuft, and diffused itself to his very maimed finger whose tip he had carpentered when a boy. From the coincidence of these simple beginnings, then, life's dingy repetitions grew, for these two, purposeful and coloured of the brightest hues. The pair were of humble rank, their doings for ever un obtrusive : two bees of the hive. Mary was addicted to the Church necessitous, and her wool dogs were the coveted of many curates, while Harling strove in uncongenial labours for the prize of existence, and, if the best should fall, a wife and a semi-detached. Time is short for commonplace, and these love affairs, how commonplace they are ! How vulgar ! Does not every man who comes round the corner of the street mean many such ? \" Most men and most t 2"], [288, "276 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. women are but one couple more.\" And yet there are wide distinctions that would seem differences. The man who would live a long life purgatorially to win once a sympathetic touch from the plump hand of one ordinary woman : a woman with a bunch of false curls carried frankly at her forehead ; may see men and women at Epping and elsewhere, linked without emotion in a daylong, peripatetic embrace. Neverthe less are these things no more, perhaps, than the varying manners of men : the clothes they wear, the language they speak ; and in what does Je t'aime differ from \" I love you \" ? Heaven-soaring aspirations link them selves as readily to uncouthness and vulgarity as to taste and well-breeding ; poets as true have sat under a hedge to wedge their cheeks with blocks of bread and-cheese fuel pruned with a jack-knife and demon strative thumb from the main hunch, as ever adopted the air and hair of a cult, or sat to dainty-spread tables. It is true, romance cannot hold to this; but then romance will not have a hair-dresser to weep, nor a hatter tragic, nor a pepper merchant bound in a poetic affection. So for Harling and his Mary ; whatever of hum drum and matter-of-fact belongs to their affair, it was for them a real and ennobling experience, and one that called into being all the finer human sus ceptibilities ; otherwise, the fact that Harling's sensi bilities were dull, and his imagination lacking of all"], [289, "HARLING'S DESTINY. 277 power to idealise, makes his story, his one story, absolutely unaccountable and inexplicable. They were engaged to be married, and, more than this, they hoped and lived only to be married. Marriage was for them an ultimate apotheosis be yond which they were content not to inquire. The necessary consideration of ways and means which for several years had held them apart, seemed to have no reference to a state of existence ; like the wed ding-ring, it helped to make up only the sheaf of appurtenances which is part offering at the altar of Hymen. Thus, for its simple sincerity, there was a latent pathos in their affair ; for the gods also have engagements to keep, and it was not to be : there lay the pity of it. Similarly might two ants labour ingeniously for the safe removal of a pupa, a matter as important as any one private interest in the world, and a cart-wheel, a thing extraneous from and mean ingless to the ant-world, render them and their pur pose a microscopic blot in the dust. It has been said that but for the glowing reality of his attachment, Harling's story would remain for ever inscrutable, more especially as he was in other connections as unimpressible as a hippopotamus. Stunted by the monotonous repetitions of his life \u2014 the gray pacings to and fro in which his duty lay \u2014 nothing had come to him but what had stuck to him from the outside ; he had learned nothing but what"], [290, "278 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. had been conveyed by reiterated words. The phases of his life were merged like a tale of equal beads ; his conclusions were slowly formed and adamantine, and were played upon by none of the changeful winds of circumstance ; therefore he was of all men the least likely to know that same circumstance, tyrannic and definite, dragging him, as it were by the heels, to the fulfilment of a decree. That Mary should have had premonitions does not call for remark, because the telepathic sympathy between one mind and another is now a generally accredited fact, and so not marvellous at all. Harling was first conscious of this thing about him when one day he lunched with Ransome, who also had employment in the City, and Ransome said : \" Well, why not come down to us on Saturday ? My mother will be very glad to see you, and I shall be there to show you about. We are very great at autumn tints just now. What do you say ?\" Ransome sat opposite, beside a cruet with castor tops like the cupolas of St. Mark's, Venice, and had a table-spoon in his hand as he ended. There was an instant's familiarity between the words, \"We are very great at autumn tints,\" as Ransome spoke them, and his attitude beside the cruet with a table spoon in his hand ; they were linked together in some way, and the background of the crowded"], [291, "HARLING'S DESTINY. 279 dining-room with the monotonous throng of business men was just as it should be. It was like a well known picture flashed for an instant before his eyes. Harling felt that he had sat there, and Ransome had sat just so beside the architectural cruet and identically said, \" We are very great at autumn tints,\" on some previous occasion ; and yet he knew the thing had never been. This impression was but momentary, and again it was gone, yet the memory of it held him abstracted for a minute before he accepted his friend's offer, and their talk sped on. This was early in the week, and as the days passed to its close he might have forgotten a sensa tion of which most people at times have indistinct consciousness ; but once, casually, Ransome, flying past him in a stream of City men as he flew past Ransome in another, apprised him of his proximity by \" Remember Saturday\" in sudden words that brought swooping upon his recollection this two day-old experience, and he was troubled. He had known of no such things before. Another man would have been held by uneasy wonder ; two minutes later, and Harling bought a comic paper. On this very day the young man went early from his work to visit the woman he was not to marry. He walked beside Blackheath Common in the October drift of London's vapours to the house, and caught in the drawing-room the plaintive glance"], [292, "280 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. of the dearest of girls, who dutifully sat to hear from Mrs. Pow's own lips the history of her latest cook ; for so surely as you rent a house in Black heath, Mrs. Pow will call, and talk cheerily about her boiler and her burst pipes, and describe the falling of her ceiling slab by slab on to the drawing room caipet; and Miss Pow will come too, and, if you are not careful, will bring \" a little music,\" and sing to you like a weasel in a trap. \" And that dreadful woman, what do you think she said ? ' There never was a bit o' supper in this house,' and I ahvays allow my servants Oh, how do you do, Mr. Harling ? \" \" How do you do ? \" said Harling. That the lovers desired to be alone was apparent enough, but Mrs. Pow's departure was timed only to allow of a full recital of latest cook-news in another drawing-room. Her voluminous silken flounces passing behind the line of the door-jamb held Harling in distressed reflection. There was some meaning here. What was that last side- swing and draw of her skirts finally from view, that it should awake, as it were, echoes in him ? He anticipated in some subtle way the precise impression that would come conveyed to him by Mary's attitude and expression when he should turn to her. He realised that this conscious ness had belonged to him only when he saw her"], [293, "HARLING'S DESTINY. 281 unusual gravity, and asked himself why it did not surprise him. She drew him to sit beside her on the sofa, holding his arm closely, and resting her head against his shoulder as they moved across the room. \" I wanted you to come.\" \" Dearest.\" She was looking at him ; she gazed into his eyes, and upon his brow, with her lips parted as though some new inscrutable aspect of him were to be read there. Such pensiveness lay strangely upon her, whose attitude was most usually one of open buoyancy. Presently her face sank into the curved palms of her little hands, and remained so a minute before she slowly withdrew it upwards, somewhat lightened, to meet his gaze. \" What is it, dear girl ? \" \" I don't know. I thought you wouldn't come, I think, or something.\" Harling laid himself out to woo her from such moodiness, and in ten minutes she was enjoying her self in a high-spirited recital in dialogue of an imaginary scene between Mrs. Pow and her cook, wherein the emphasis of Mrs. Pow's depreciating hand-gestures, and the cook's sarcastic request for ' an 'alf a hegg to her tea,' did not require that Harling should call upon his admiration of the per former to prompt his laughter ; but a moment later,"], [294, "282 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. the passing of the maidservant's dark skirt from the room brought the memory of Mrs. Pow's departure back to him like the recollection of black guilt to a voluptuary at his pleasurings. Then their good-bye came. \" I am going down to Walsingham, to stay over Sunday with a man,\" said Harling, at parting. \" Yes, you told me.\" \" / never told you. No one can have.\" \" Couldn't they ? I thought I knew.\" There was a lover's salutation, and Harling left the room, nodding cheerily as he turned in opening the door, and started downstairs with exhilarated steps. As he sped, with the quickness of thought, doubts grew on him : vague doubts without reason, and of things he could not grasp ; but these came strongly, fresh and fresh, till instinctively his steps flagged, and he stood hesitatingly on the bottom step, in an attempt to understand these flashing abstractions that were seeming impressions of concrete facts and experiences beyond his memory. It was as if events that had appealed to him strongly had been blotted from his mind, leaving their impress yet vividly with him. What did it mean ? What was it he missed ? Some thing was absent that should have been. He looked upward, and the reason for this spontaneous act was in the eyes that from the landing above gazed down into his. He had never seen her face so, and Harling"], [295, "HARLING'S DESTINY. 283 was flying upstairs in strides that covered three steps, to feel her again in his arms. \" What is it, my little one ? \" \" I want you to be with me ! I was afraid you were going ! Don't go yet ! \" It was as if new love had been born to them at that instant, so that they knew in a moment what they had not dared to dream. There was sweet sad ness for them, and strong hopes : the hopes that are born of strength ; for in some unintelligible way hope lessness murmured ominously below and beneath those things, like the flood that surely sucks away the foundations of a house, let its weathercock have what assurance it may. On the next afternoon, the figure of Harling, clad in black cloth cut to a pattern of utility, and bearing the Gladstone bag that is also of convention, and marks the unromantic and matter-of-fact, ejected itself precipitously on to the down platform of the London terminus, from under the arch of the booking- office. Harling drew breath on finding himself four minutes to the good, and the tension of racing by sit- ting lumped up, watch in hand, behind the emotionless jog-trot of a hackney carriage-horse on traffic-blocked roads, all for the imaginary catching of a train that he calculated to travel by, should it in grace only wait one half-minute over its proper starting-time, slacked"], [296, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 284 down, and gave way to a tumultuous reaction on the senses. It was, to him, as if from the boundless night he had entered along dark passages to where a door, opening, had revealed in warm, familiar light, a room full of intimates, with the old attitudes and voice-tones, all framed in well-remembered group ings of books, furniture, and curtain-hangings, to appeal through memory, eloquently to him. As one unawares suddenly confronted thus would feel re cognition whirl up to daze him before this same recognition spread from consciousness to mind, and all should be balanced by reason, so was it with Harling as he entered upon the open platform. The thing was with him again, and held. It grew in the moment of his glance, travelling reassured from the clock to find the position of his train. It came to him chiefly through the senses of smell, hearing, and taste: the senses of reminiscence. His eyes showed him little, yet the visual impress of the scene was in harmony and at one with those other. The hissing escapes of two locomotives near and distant, and in differing key, echoing under the wide span of glass and iron roofing; the clatter and rumble of trundling luggage-tiucks, light and heavy ; the blended medley of suppressed stenches rising from the secrets of the grimed and garnished platforms : from their furnishings smeared to cleanness : from"], [297, "HARLING'S DESTINY. 285 the hot, juicy engines ; the racked lamps hot, again, in eagerness to fry each other's drippings, and send ing forth sampled horrors in stale and fresh oil ; the unclean freshness of piled printings on the bookstall; the metallic savours of coffee corroding an iron boiler in the buffet, and the oppressive foulness of air wrought by incombustion of its heating jets ; the sulphurous waste from engine-fires tasting dry on the tongue and palate; the smooth, sweeping line of carriages, with the engine starting into clearness at the open station end ; and, beyond, the meeting and intersecting of winding rails stretching in curves of black and glitter through the perspective of brick arches into fog, and the shadow of more grime ; \u2014 each of these aspects was as the string of a great harp, that by sympathetic vibration woke on simi larly tuned strings within Harling reminiscent echoes, as it were, from the very eternal, as it played loud and soft, in confused harmonies, or with the tinkle of single notes, upon his senses. Harling, with rising tumults of awe and horror, strained to catch the concrete aspect ; to realise a cause for these crowding impalpable, dissociate impressions ; to understand how they should be awakened in him. \"Was I born and bred here?\" he almost exclaimed. Still there they yet remained inexorably defying his reason. Fear stole coldly upon him, up his back to his"], [298, "286 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. cheek. He felt as one of high-strung nerves feels, who, in the dark lane at night, fancies stealthy feet following on his heels. The slamming of doors, and a short, authoritative voice in his ear, came stimulatingly to him. He hastened to his carriage. \" Walsingham ? \" \" Right forward ! Be quick, sir ! \" At this moment the fierce hissing of the loco motive melted to silence. In the distance yet another fizzed ; a train was running in with brakes hard down ; and the noisy banging and rattling of milk cans merged with the whistling of his own train, just as a whiff of oily smoke came across to him hot from a rack of lamps hard by. These things, so combined and rising one out of the other, struck home upon Harling with a truth so forcible and mysterious, that for a minute he was mastered by terror. He must away \u2014 away from this ! He seized his bag, and made for the door, with the idea of regaining the platform now gliding ever more quickly below him. His intention was perceived by an official, who sprang to hold his hand, now upon the handle of the door. The fellow stood upon the footboard, while the speed grew considerable. \" Anything wrong, sir ? \" \" I want to get out.\" \" You'll have to go on to Finningstoke now, sir.\""], [299, "HARLING'S DESTINY. 287 \" Do we stop at Wington ? \" \" That's right.\" He skipped to the ground with the dexterity of long practice, as the train drew away from the extremity of the platform. \" I'll go and see Voisley at Wington,\" said Harling, with bright eyes ; and he sank into a corner-seat sighing relief. \" I won't go to Walsingham at all. I'll go and see Voisley; he has often pressed me. Ah!\" The rustle of a newspaper, as the glaring, resentful eye of a British fellow-traveller sank behind it on meeting his gaze, was the last of these shadows of unseen substance which now faded from Harling's senses. He remained awed by his experience, but braced himself with a determination not to go to Walsingham. He did not trouble himself to understand why this impulse should hold him so strongly. In some unreasonable, inexplicable way it had sprung spon taneously from the crisis of his late horror; but the instinct was so really his, and the determination so effective a consolant of his fear, that he no further considered his motive than a man should work out the steps of reasoning that induced him to fly before the charge of a bull. The sun, low over the hedges, struck brightly into the carriage to cheer him, and his awe melted through"], [300, "288 STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. foreboding to wonder, and he began again to try and understand. He puzzled himself to realise the thing apart from himself, as though it were not purely of himself; but always he decided personally that he was sickening for an illness, and always, by some subtle intuition, he knew otherwise, and concluded with a sigh of relief. Ah ! well, he would not go to Walsingham. But why? He had arrived only where he had set out, and a new effort would carry him over this same path of thought, till, in growing monotony, he began to notice the telegraph-posts as they went flipping past the window. Unconsciously at first, following them with his eye, they gradually loomed out upon him with some obscure meaning, which he could not, and yet dared not, try to read. They were the flying yards carry ing him forward to some other place; they were the flying seconds carrying him forward to some other time. In their accurate procession they stood up straight and strong, one and another, and in long lines that were passed, and in long lines before : sentries picketing the way he must go. He saw in his mind winding miles of them stand waiting for him to pass, as he must : waiting as the stars wait at night. Their watchfulness was a more terrible thing, because it was on occasions broken in upon by a country-side station, a tunnel, and so forth ; but always they appeared again serenely standing, to tell"], [301, "HARLING'S DESTINY. 289 him their watch was true and constant. Once, in the flash of passing under a bridge, they were gone, and did not return. Harling felt almost conscious relief at this, and, after a minute, changed his position at the window ; then, on the other side of the railway, he saw their austere, obdurate rank marching past as before. The view at the window twinkled and winked, and the roar of the rushing train hollowed. A station streaked by in horizontal lines, and among these black lettering stood out boldly but indistinctly for a moment, on a white board. Harling sprang up. \" What's that ? \" The paper fell from the Briton's face \" I beg your pardon.\" \" Can you tell me, please, what station that was ? \" The Briton looked dully from one window and the other and back again. \" It must have been Wington. Yes ; there's Rainford Church, don't you see, among the trees ? \" \" Oh, but they said we stopped at Wington ? \" \" 'Fraid I can't help you,\" said the Briton. \" You should have got in at the end of the train ; it slips at the junction. Our next stop is Walsingham.\" He looked into Harling's fixed face for a moment, and then screened himself with his paper. u"], [302, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 290 Harling sat down again, with troubled mind, and forebodings stalking him as it were. Across his gaze into the early closing of the afternoon, the telegraph posts strode by in predestinate inflexibility. He watched the grouped wires rise and sink like the waves of the sea ; it seemed to him as though they had been so in all his dreams ; and an hour passed. They were at Walsingham. Harling tried to force a decision upon himself ; as he stood he heard the doors of the carriages slamming, and, still un settled and apart from his willing, he mechanically stepped from the compartment, bag in hand. As he waited in blank indecision, the train moved out from the station. The tail of the carriages sucking away from him, its red lights staring dully in the fading afternoon and dwindling smoothly, struck in upon his vacant attitude of mind as a rapier-point to his vitals, and brought whirling up to his brain yet again these mystic recognitions which now surrounded him like crowding phantoms, unreal as the image thrown on the table of a camera obscura : imponderable, impalpable. Weakened as he was by his previous experiences, the thing seized and mastered him : his will was its toy. His brain was as a revolving wheel ; he could hold no idea upon which to act ; every impulse as it loomed was passed, and before him were others changing elusively. If he could have run and snatched that green flag, or overset"], [303, "HARLING'S DESTINY. 291 that piled luggage, the spell, momentarily, would have fallen from him, but his very thoughts now belonged to the scene : he felt himself to be of it, and his rambling reflections were broken in upon, at the critically exact instant, by the solicitous accents of a country-side railway porter. There was no conveyance awaiting him ; he had wired an excuse for his intended non-appearance in the brief moments of his train's stop at Finningstoke, and now he followed the suggestion of a station official, and hired a trap at a neighbouring inn, that was a \" Hotel \" by infection of the railway. The landlord came out of a hot bar into the passage. Grinding stridulous voices rose loud as he opened the door, and were smothered back again as he closed it to face Harling. The man swayed where he stood with his shirt sleeves rolled up, and, on Harling's request, looked at his watch, and then about him a little sulkily before he turned a back that closed the passage-way, and retreated on dubious legs to where he could prop himself against a door-frame and cry : \" Bill ! \" The ostler answered promptly to the call, a few words passed, the landlord returned to the bar with a stolid air of grievance burdening him, and his man, after a sharp glance at the customer, was lost also. Time now passed for Harling not by duration, but by change. It might have been equally an hour u 2"], [304, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 292 or five minutes that elapsed, before he ascended into a gig beside a transplanted cockney stableman, and started on a drive that might have been nightlong, or of but ten minutes' duration, to his whirling drunken senses. Their destination was \" nigh upon five mile \" distant, when first they passed, in the darkening evening, batches of clotted suburban residences : hall-doors and bow-windows (that's for respectability) run together and caked there. Then there were the back offices of the railway again, and a hopeful young slum went by, and so past scrubby patches of garden screened with broken hedges holding battered tin ware aloft to the witness of Heaven in their lean winter branches, where linen dried and fowls scratched an existence. Another railway bridge pasted with advertisements, and the nettles were happy in sharing the roadside equally with cinders and broken crockery, as the high-road led on for a distance before a turn to the left found them in the scented country. Once a homeward-bound labourer, plodding with unwieldy legs, recognised the driver of the trap, and spoke, shouting as they approached, and his voice dying away behind them, while a little puff of wind came across the still cold air and hit Har ling's cheek. His companion touched the horse \" 'E's a bad lot, 'e is.\" It was afterwards, the road having changed many"], [305, "HARLING'S DESTINY. 293 times, that the fellow pointed with his whip through a break in the country : \" That's the Spaht 'ahse, sir.\" \"The ?\" \" The Spaht 'ahse, where you're going ter.\" \"Oh yes, the Spout House.\" \" That's the Spaht what stands up to the raght. Ah ! yer can't see it nah. Hit's what they call a copy'old, that is, and when the chimbley falls or they hahter patch it up, the right '11 go. The 'ahse has been burnt dahn twice, but the Spaht has always stood ; it's part of th' old building. Get on ! \" They turned again, and then through the gates into the drive that wound between iron-rail fences over the bosom of a grassy hill. There were to be dimly seen the indefinite forms of grazing cattle, while to one side, at a short distance, a wood of beech and other trees closed the view. Little puffs of wind came now, short and sudden, carrying whispers of death and decay in the autumn scents : damp and chilling ; and slowly there arose over the line of the curved hill-slope a near view of the house rising inch by inch out of the ground with each effort of the labouring horse. The sunset was pale behind its gables, and, by contrast, its dull brick walls and tiled roof stood up facing them flat and sombre-hued. Where the main block of the building fell away to the offices and stables a group of Scotch firs partially"], [306, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 294 screened and overwhelmed it, and beside these again, from the back rose up a fantastical brick chimney stalk. This was the Spout. The pale golden-gray effulgence of the background, the heavy sombre cloud of foliage, and the flat black aspect of the gabled front blotting the light, all combined to give a peculiar emphasis to this quaint gnarled singer point ing to the skies. Even to the casual observer the spectacle was replete with a sombre eloquence. Har ling felt it was what he had travelled for : it was the beginning of the end when he first set eyes on the building in these environments : it was the con summation of what the telegraph-posts had been obscurely hinting to him in their terrible reiteration. He was not physically affected by this crowning appeal ; the hurrying impressions of the past hour had held him dazed ; he was resigned to this thing. He alighted with stunned senses. The gig turned back with wheels that briefly crunched the gravel, and the harsh night seemed to close suddenly upon him as though to bar his retreat. Before him was the light ; a clock ticked in the hall, and a warm breath of hospitality came out to him; it was the way he must go, and he stepped automatically to meet a surprised reception. His friend had left home to shoot at a neighbour's on receiving his telegram ; and his old mother, and his aunt, older and whiter still, and deaf, regretted"], [307, "HARLING'S DESTINY. 295 this in prolix sentences that fell upon his ears like the words of songs that had been used to hush him in his childhood. They dined at the end of the table : two old women of the country and a young man of the town. The clock ticked in the background inter mittent to the ear ; the servants moved silently over the thick pile of Turkey carpet ; the long sallow faces of years-dead men and women gazed down from above the wainscot; and again the clock ticked, and the serving of dinner was as a mystic rite. Once the wind flung itself against the casement window rudely as it passed the house, and the heavy curtains were drawn more closely. Harling was apathetic ; like a sick man, he resigned himself. It was close now, and coming closer. Once there welled up in him a great gush of love that warmed his cheek and sank back to its fountain : a long, solitary cry in the desert. Ninety miles away Mary moved to her sister's side to kiss her ; her eyes were very bright. \" Dear,\" she said, \" I am very happy.\" The evening dragged out its short hours, and when Harling went to his room, it was as if the stairs passed under his feet and his bed came to him, so little did he belong to his own existence. At the window a trailing ivy-branch threshed des perately, and a great squall of wind went shuddering"], [308, "STORIES AND PLAY STORIES. 296 and grumbling over the house and away into the trees, and as he listened to its distant murmur, a chip of mortar clinked into the grate. His bed received him soothingly, but as he first found him self in the darkness, with the dim square of the window forming itself slowly to his unaccustomed eyes, the murmur of a heavy gust came charging down, and he trembled through all his frame, and clutched his pillow to control himself. It was not conscious fear that had taken hold of him, but some how it was very close now, and he did not under stand. A minute later a happiness of resignation possessed him, and he composed himself gratefully to sleep. The wind raged that night, and beat down strong trees that had braved it through the centuries. The women of the house lay quaking, and kept their lamps burning for safety, until the tempest brought them a distant sound as of thunder. This grew in a crescendo that seemed reaching to the eternal. It came on in battalions, millions of it, and in close rank. The house throbbed as the steerage of a steamship throbs when the bows dip and the screw rises to thresh the surface. It was come. Out of the hurry and shouting of the storm another sound arose that began in secret, and rolled out above it, and swelled to a great crashing shock, and sank again to show that the wind had passed and left"], [309, "HARLING'S DESTINY. 297 behind it a rattling and clinking : the sound of detached bricks and lumps of plaster falling through the roof on to seventy tons of shattered brickwork lying in the cellars. Under the ruin of the old chimney lay what was once a bed and its tenant, and the floors, carpets, and furnishings of two storeys. In the gray darkness at Blackheath, the sleeping girl sprang up and stood breathless on the floor, her hands pressing the white broideries at her bosom. \" What was that ? What was that ? \" she cried again. The wind was soughing round the house, and came crooning to her as she listened to remind her of her kind surroundings, and her security, and the sweetness of her lot."], [310, "\"AS YOU WERE.\" By VIOLET HUNT, Author of \" A Hard Woman\" \" Tlie Way of Marriage,\" etc. Canon and Mrs. Byng.

Mrs. Byng. Oh, you ought really to write a tract ! Do you know what your husband, dear good man, said to me as we went up ? MRS. Bell. Something inadequate, I fear. He is never equal to the occasion, poor Tom ! Mrs. Byng (laughing). That he preferred the golden chariot, and to take the journey in one stage, when he did go. Mrs. BELL (staring). Journey, where ? Mrs. Byng. My dear, don't be obtuse ! MRS. Bell. Oh, I see. How dreadfully profane ! Quite ribald, in fact ! Mrs. Byng. Yes, it was rather, but it amused me. You don't appreciate Major Bell a bit, Laura. Let us change husbands. MRS. BELL. Madge, you absurd woman ! MRS. Byng (nodding). Yes, I got a little giddy going up that corkscrew staircase.

Well, it was always the Church militant, you know ! Deans and Canons are but human, and there's a good deal of gossip swept up with the verger's broom. Mrs. Bell. But at least the talk is all of matters connected with the sacred rites and observ ances of the Church ? It must be so beautiful, so interesting ! But I have to listen to the tedious chatter of subalterns who are everlastingly coming to tea, and hear them wondering why the Major did this, and Mrs. So-and-so didn't do that, and who is coming and who is going, and idiotic gossip of that kind, from morning till night.

BELL. And Smith-Dolby? Mrs. Byng. One of the Minor Canons, and James's pet aversion. Mrs. Bell. Why? MRS. Byng. I hardly know. One must dislike somebody. Because he's so untidy and lazy, and always contrives to take his holiday in that un comfortable time between the seasons, before the stoves are lighted regularly, and the chances are you have to shiver all through service. I wish they would give him a living. We are all dying for promotion here, just as you are in the Army. Mrs. Bell. Tom doesn't care for promotion. Mrs. Byng. Oh, doesn't he ?

I was only throwing myself into the situation. I had quite given you James. I saw you hoisting on his surplice and copying out his sermons in my mind's eye.
