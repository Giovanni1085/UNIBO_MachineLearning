This holiday task I have taken as a work of love. My uncle never troubled himself as to the question of whether he was a major or minor poet, and in presenting this volume I prefer merely to announce it in the words of the sub-title of his ' Messis Vitae,' namely as ' Gleanings of Song from a Happy Life.' Many of the lays, lyrics and ballads included, are familiar to Scots through out the world, and it is my hope that this selection will be as welcome to them as to a wider public not so familiar with these joyous effusions of a healthy soul. In placing the selections under various headings, my division has necessarily been more or less arbi trary, and for a palpable reason I offer no apology for including certain lays, as, for instance, ' The Lay"], [16, "INTRODUCTORY NOTE vm of the Brave Cameron,' under the heading of ' Ballads.' With the exception of a few hitherto unpublished poems, the selection is made from ' The Lays and Legends of Ancient Greece,' ' Lyrical Poems,' ' Lays of the Highlands and Islands,' ' Musa Burschicosa,' ' Messis Vitae,' ' Songs of Religion and Life,' ' The War Songs of the Germans,' and 'The Language and Literature of the Scottish Highlands,' to the publishers of which, Messrs William Blackwood & Sons, Messrs Macmillan & Co., Mr David Douglas and Mr Walter Scott, I have to express my gratitude for their gracious consent to quote from works of which they hold the copyright, or part copyright. It is only necessary for me to add, that if any poem is omitted from the volume, which anyone, ac quainted with the poems of my uncle, deems worthy of inclusion in such a selection, I can only plead the excuses for neglecting such an inclusion, of the limit of my space and the limit of my judgment.

Robert Buchanan. It is not for me to attempt to sketch the life history of John Stuart Blackie. That has already been done in an intelligent and sympathetic way by Miss Anna Stoddart, and my readers will turn to her pages for most that is worthy of record and preservation in the story of his rich and active life. All I can hope to attempt is, to lay a small stone upon his cairn ; to give, in attempting to estimate the character of the man, a small tribute of esteem to one, whom from close personal intercourse I learned to love, and I hope, understand well. If, as I firmly believe, that man can estimate best who loves best, then I can offer no apology for my estimation. I do not presume a criticism, though that is much easier, as Vauvenarques says, than an estima tion, and if what I write may savour more of a eulogy than an appreciation, I would only ask that my presentation be judged in the light of my intimate acquaintance and of my affection. I have many memories of him, some very real, very A"], [22, "AN APPRECIATION 2 living, some in a degree less so ; some more sacred are like spectres creeping up from the God's-acre of my heart. Of these memories some are 'roses blowing along the pathway I pursue'; in brooding over others, I seem to catch the echo of a martial note. I like to think of him (to use a dear friend's words) as ' The Happy Warrior ; ' but I think of him more, when gathered round the fire of an evening, we talked together, and he poured out to me words of wisdom, the outcome of a life of thought, action and moral triumph. Only those few who came near to his heart in this way, really had a full appreciation of the simple sweetness and saintly nobleness of his character. In such a way one received a better picture of the man than could be obtained from the apparently strange contradictions of his public appear ances. The picture of his life, however well-drawn, will always have a certain want of perspective, for he was not a man easy to understand ; outspoken on some subjects, he was extremely reticent on others, and it was difficult always to make a philosophical balance. It is this feeling that weighed with me when I read the many notices and biographies which appeared after his death, some even by near friends. There was, of course, always half the truth, and that, as my uncle used to say, is sometimes worse than a lie. There is one great exception, that is the work of Miss Anna Stoddart, to whom I must express my personal gratitude, for painting such a living picture of him whose departure has made my life more shadowy and my living less joyful. My memories of him are chiefly those connected"], [23, "AN APPRECIATION 3 with his home life in his latter years. Oh, that a Bos well could have sat at the festal boards of Altna Craig, Hill Street, and Douglas Crescent, ' when we gathered and ate with much disputing hum,' and chronicled the flashes of wisdom and wit which poured incessantly from his lips, the ready servants of his brain and heart ! There was no pedantry to damp the soul there, no clogging formalism to block the living streams which flowed in those physically and morally healthy veins. A comparatively insignificant illusion here, a trivial remark there, was readily caught by those marvellous ears of his, and turned into the channels of wisdom, from which one returned morally and mentally stimulated. However boisterous the sally, however dramatic the action, it was merely the froth on a well of virile wisdom, deep insight, catholic comparison and lovable charity. It might be a playful dig at the ribs of an Oxford don, a hard knock on the head of a 'Radical infallible,' or it might be the instilling of the wisdom of Goethe, or the ' quit-you-like-men ' doctrine of St Paul, but all came from a heart that bore ill to no man, from one who ' found a kiss in every cross,' and couched in language that made the heart beat stronger at the time, and which left much that on meditation made the brain grow bigger. At other times I found him not the teacher, but the taught. Seeking in \u2014 I must grant \u2014 a terribly searching way, to find out what you knew, and apply ing it to the general philosophy of life. When I recall him now, I always have in my memory the impression of a wise man. There was nothing"], [24, "AN APPRECIATION 4 ordinary about him, and the least ordinary was the unique richness and moral glow of his language. I speak of him, of course, as I knew him at home, and I do not stand as judge for the experiences of other men. He was of all things broadly human, and all the philosophy that really interested him, was the philosophy that came down to the very hearth, if I may so put it, of man. Life, and the practical pro blems of life, were the ' trade-marks,' of all his teaching. He recognised the value of 'digging into the dead guts of things,' but he recognised the limits of such research and gave it its due place in the educational economy. Wisdom, not mere knowledge, love, reverence, moderation, were for him the cardinal virtues with which to reach to the highest of all attainable virtues, truth. Of other memories, I have that of the first letter he wrote to me, in which he said, \u2014 ' I know you will have the good sense not to be offended with the rough and unceremonious way in which I have some times contradicted your propositions. Contradiction is useful for all, and those who cannot learn from contradiction will remain mere special pleaders for their own point of view all their lives, and never know what wisdom means. The grand thing is to start in life with a deep conviction of the vastness of the world and the smallness of man, and to fling out broad arms of loving appreciation and reverential regard to all the phases of the true, the good, and the beautiful, which make up this eternal divine miracle called the world, which is in very deed the living architecture, poetry, sculpture, painting,"], [25, "AN APPRECIATION 5 and music of the one self-existent, plastic, all embracing logos of which the biggest man is only a small fraction. Above all things, avoid the tempta tion of wishing to appear clever and smart ; cleverness is only valuable as an unconscious accompaniment of an honest reality, such as the bicker of a mountain tarn or the flashing of a trout in a stream. Read the Sermon on the Mount, or the twelfth of Romans, or i Cor. xiii., at least once a week, and act them out every day of the week and every hour of the day. Know above all things what Goethe preaches as emphatically as St Paul, that love is the fulfilling of the law ; it is the regular steam power of the soul, or electricity \u2014 if you please \u2014 of the moral world, \" knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.\" There is no constructive, no shaping power, in mere know ledge, it merely supplies materials for the motive power, and the regulative reason to use for the realisa tion of a noble ideal divinely rooted in the nature of a noble soul.' Many years ago Thomas Carlyle wrote of John Stuart Blackie : ' A man of lively intellectual faculties, of ardent friendly character, and of wide speculation and acquirement, very fearless, very kindly, without ill-humour and without guile.' A very kindly estima tion, coming as it does from the Sage of Chelsea, remembering how severe were many of the judgments he passed on those even with whom he was in the closest personal relationship ; a much more charitable estimation of the man than the previous one from the letter of Carlyle to Emerson, in which the ' notable monster,' looking only at the time upon Blackie's"], [26, "AN APPRECIATION 6 exuberant presentation, and not troubling to get down to the soul of the man, spoke of him as ' a man of more sail than ballast.' John Stuart Blackie, indeed, had plenty of sail. His barque was always in good working order, to sail 'away, away down the stream,' but at the same time it was always well-braced, and the hand that guided was never off the rudder. Too many candid critics, in their notices of his life, have failed in the want of mental perspective to grasp the fact, that Professor Blackie's many exuberant outbursts in public were simply the outcome of a vast amount of animal spirit, and a resultant of the fact, that with the exception of these public appearances, he had few other means of mental detraction. At home, accustomed to a hard and persistent intellectual life, serious, thoughtful, and ascetic, he sought in the catholic sphere of the popular platform a relief from ' sitting with moody pains and anxious peering looks, clogging the veins of laden brains with the dust of maundering books.' No longer tied down by philosophic consecutiveness and scientific accuracy, he found, in the less exacting, but more humanising atmosphere of the popular platform an outcome for his bright presentation of the beauties, physical and ethical, of this beautiful world. It is not true that these lectures were delivered off-hand without preparation. Down to the smallest action of life, that was not Blackie's method. However unimportant the occasion, however comparatively unimportant in the economy of things, the subject, yet it demanded, and received from him, the most earnest investigation"], [27, "AN APPRECIATION 7 and meditation. The facts, and the matured consider ation of the facts, were there, however much, in the joy and healthy exuberance of the moment, he omitted reference to his manuscript, left the more limited fields of the specific subject on hand, and wandered into the richer growths of Socrates, Goethe, Aristotle, and St Paul. And even when on occasion something more than usually extravagant was hurled at the heads of a sympathetic audience, on consideration of this, perhaps, humorous aphorism, it would lend one more and more to the belief in a popular dictum, that ' there is generally more in Blackie's nonsense, than in most people's sense.' Unless this aspect of the question is carefully borne in mind, and an attempt at estimation be founded on the knowledge of how earnest, persistent and scientific a student he was, and how much im portant work was evolved in his life-time, one will be apt to arrive at that false conclusion which some critics of the man have arrived at. I grant it was difficult to picture in the jovial, lively, often very eccentric, figure of the platform, the quiet, serious methodical man of the library, the eager and reverential searcher after truth. Dr Whyte's metaphor was a happy one when he said, ' Like Socrates, he was not unlike those Athenian busts of Silenus, which had pipes and flutes in their mouths, but open them and there was the image of a God.' And in this connection I might tell my only Blackie ' story.' Not long ago he paid a visit to the sanctum of an Edinburgh publisher, and mentioned that he had lectured the previous night on Scottish"], [28, "8 AN APPRECIATION Home Rule. The publisher said, ' I am astonished at your fondness for making an exhibition of your self.' Professor Blackie, without another word, turned on his heel and went away, slamming the door. Presently he came back, opened the door, thrust in his head and said, ' Do you know that's just what my wife tells me ! ' Certain it is that the popularity and affection which he enjoyed in his native land as a professor, increased in volume and geographical extent when he became a public lecturer. And it was no mean gift which enabled the close student of philology and philosophy to so re-cook his academic dishes, as to satisfy the appetites of the extra-mural world. And that he succeeded in doing so is testified by all. His studies in German literature and philosophy gave him ample scope to lecture on the practical philosophy of Goethe, to preach to them of ' the three reverences,' and the practical and far-seeing maxium, ' that the world is governed by wisdom, by authority and by show ; ' his classical attainments and his intimate acquaintance with the wise men of Greece gave him the foundation for his popular re-dressing of the Socratic, Platonic and Aristotelean philosophies. Writing to Dr Walter Smith on the 9th of March last, a few days after the Scottish people had laid him with kingly honours in the Dean Cemetery, Sir Theodore Martin wrote of his old friend : ' It was impossible not to love him \u2014 not only for his fiery energy and determination to work out for good what ever power God had given him, but for the truly original purity of his nature.' And this ' determina-"], [29, "AN APPRECIATION 9 tion to work out for good whatever power God had given him,' was evinced in every step he took towards work. The knowledge of the most fruitful source for the ultilisation of his powers came slow at first. Trammelled by the limitations of his early northern environment, and ungifted in his youth with any par ticular inspiration to recognise the superior merits of any particular profession, a brief sojourn, in the attempt to grapple with the lower branches of the law in Aberdeen, was soon dispelled by an accidental occurrence of a depressing kind, acting on a nature yet untrained to treat such fatalities philosophically. He became troubled about his ' inner life,' and we find him attempting to get some breath into the lungs of his moral nature by a nearly fatal course of morbid intro spection. But there was a wise man of Aberdeen, called Forbes, and his timely remark that Blackie ' wanted his jacket widening,' had the desired result of dragging him from the narrowing influences of the theology of his own native Universities, and planting him among the philosophers of Germany and of Italy. All these influences, all these environments at Aberdeen, at Edinburgh, in Germany, in Italy, and afterwards in Greece, and again while studying for the Bar in Edinburgh, had important bearings upon his character, upon his moral and intellectual aspect. No doubt, from his early training, he received that tendency to see so much that was to be admired in the religious history and systems of his forefathers, and no doubt, too, in these early days the influence of a wise father first stimulated him with a love, to become a passion in its intensity, for the romantic"], [30, "AN APPRECIATION 10 traditions and associations of his beloved Scot land. To his German environment can be traced that influence which lead him to grasp with a firm hand, a philosophical interpretation of the history of the world, to obtain for the first time a clear conception of the philosophic attitude which should always be found in the academic teacher; and also to his German influences can be traced most of those broad, Catholic tendencies which were to be found in after years in whatever he wrote or spoke on questions of a theological, moral and social nature. The general influence of his theological training in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Germany, found expres sion from time to time in his warm interest in the methods of different theological and ecclesiastical systems and in the interpretations of them, of the fundamental points of the foundations of Christian Church Government. From Italy, no doubt, came his interest in archi tecture, art and arch\u00e6ology, especially the latter ; in fact, it was by the merest chance that he escaped taking up the subject as the chief element in his life work. And of his Hellenistic environment it is only neces sary to say, that it was the source of all his vigorous pursuit of the question treating of the philological connection between what are called ancient and modern Greek. To this must he added his training for the Bar, which, considered purely abstractly, must have had a considerable influence in adding an analytical as well"], [31, "AN APPRECIATION 11 as a synthetical power to his estimation of all questions, and which certainly made of him a cautious and a systematic man in all the more practical con cerns of life. Accordingly, in an analysis of his complex person ality, we would have to trace the various sources of this and that characteristic and find out the remnants of Blackie the introspective student of theology, Blackie the German, Blackie the arch\u00e6ologist, Blackie the lawyer, Blackie the Hellenist, and lastly, Blackie the philologist, all tending to the Blackie as we knew him \u2014 Blackie the philosopher and seer. But up to the time when we find him admitted a member of the Scottish Bar, we trace no definite evidence of that intense love for the beauties and the inspirations of Nature, which became so evident in his later years, and from which sprang most that was eloquent not only in his verse, but in all his inter pretation of the meanings of God's creation. It was at the time when he first caught the glamour from the hills, ' his glorious Bens,' as he called them, that we find him pouring forth his best utterances in verse. The genesis of his poetry, the poetry of religion and life in their broadest meanings, dates from a time after the genesis of his broad Catholic philosophy in Germany, and when once the glory of the hills was upon him, the influence of this new light never left him. Hereafter he sought Nature as the fountain head of his philosophy ; hereafter Nature became the important word in his vocabulary. Nature in teaching \u2014 Nature in song \u2014 Nature in religion \u2014 and although in most of his poetical works ' the \u00e6sthetical,' as Miss"], [32, "AN APPRECIATION 12 Stoddart says, 'was subservient to the ethical,' yet much of his best work in this direction is to be found in those poems which speak of the beauties of Nature in its unpeopled nakedness. Nature, as representing the revelations of the brown heath and shaggy wood, the mountain and the flood. True, again, in all his pictures of the presentations and changes of Nature, he never caught the glamour and mystery of Nature itself, as for instance it was caught by Robert Buchanan in his ' Coruisken Sonnets.' Both Blackie and Buchanan came under the influence of similar spells in the Western Highlands, and it is curious to compare the mystic interpretations of Buchanan with the ethical interpretation of Blackie. It would be as impossible for me in the space I have at my disposal, as it would be idle at this early hour, to attempt to form a true estimate of Blackie's literary work. It is a long cry from the translation of ' Faust ' in 1833 to his ' Christianity and The Ideal of Humanity' in 1893, and during those years some 40 volumes saw the light of day. Of this work it would be impossible to say that it all rises to an equal standard of comparative excellence, and to judge correctly of the value of his contribution to literature, one must not lose sight of the fact, that much of it was intended only to be of a comparatively ephemeral nature, rather to act as a stimulus at the moment, than to remain a permanent monument on the question or questions concerned. Under this category must be placed several of his volumes of essays ; many of them full of sound sense, keen judgment and rare discrimination, and all written in that nervous, forcible"], [33, "AN APPRECIATION 13 English so characteristic of the man. In fact, there are or were few of his contemporaries who pos sessed in such a marked degree that power to rouse. It was the mightiest gift of Carlyle, in a less degree it is one of the powers of Ruskin, and, in John Stuart Blackie's case, it assured for him that great influence on a people which was evidenced over and over again, not the least remarkably, on March 2d last. Excluding, then, this work of a comparatively ephemeral nature, we are left with some very im portant contributions, which critics of standing have accorded no mean place in the niche of literature. His translations of ' Homer,' ' \u00c6schylus,' ' Faust,' have called forth the praise of those entitled to judge, and if his ' Homer ' never received that recognition in the classical world which its ' pro found scholarship and research, clear insight, healthy feeling and great literary power' (to quote a con temporary criticism) deserved, the secret might be found in the fact that it emanated from a Scottish University. In connection with this translation, a learned German remarks, that ' it was a happy thought of Blackie's to render the great \"Volks Epos\" (people's poem) of Greece into the metre familiar to his countrymen in their own folk songs.' In conclud ing an exhaustive criticism of the work at the time, a leading critic said, ' the work is a proof of the vitality and high aims of Scottish scholarship, and reflects the greatest honour on the university and country in which it has been produced.' The following two passages of a somewhat different"], [34, "AN APPRECIATION 14 nature will give some idea of the metre and spirit of the translation : \u2014 ' Thus he ; and stretched his arm to clasp his infant son so dear, But on the breast of his well-ezoned nurse the babe shrunk back with fear, Scared at the gleam of the barnished brass which cased that warrior dread, And screamed to see the horse-hair crest high nodding o'er his head. The father laughed, the mother smiled ; then Hector brave unbound The helmet from his head, and laid it glittering on the ground, And kissed his son, and dandled him aloft with fondest joy ; Then to greet Jove and all the gods, thus prayed to bless the boy ; Jove, and ye mighty gods, grant this my son, one day, may be As I am now to Trojan men \u2014 the bulwark of the free ; Ruling o'er Troy by valorous might ; then from the hostile fray Shall some one see him home return, and thus shall proudly say : \u2014 From a good sire a better son hath rescued Troy to-day ! And when he bears proud trophies through the sounding streets of Troy, His mother shall behold her son, and her heart shall leap for joy! He spake : and to his dear wife s hands he gave the lovely child ; She took him to her balmy breast, and, through her weeping, smiled.' ' But now the hosts together rushed, and each did each assail, And buckler upon buckler rang, and hurtled mail on mail, And might of man did might oppose, flashed spear to spear and rang The war-cry loud and shrill, and shield met shield with brassy clang ; And many a shout and many a yell to heaven commingled goeth From men who struck and men who fell ; the field with crimson floweth. As when fierce wintry torrents down some grey hill's deep- scarred side Pour to the glen the headlong force of their foamy-hissing tide"], [35, "AN APPRECIATION \u25a05 Sheer through the black ravine, with fountains ever fresh supplied ; While perched on some high crag the swain hears the shrill tempest's rattle ; So swelled from host to host the din, and rang the yell of battle.' And from a host of congratulatory letters from scholars and others, I offer no apology for quoting these words of a poet. Writing on 7th November 1866, Robert Buchanan said, 'My learning goes far enough to allow me to apply the poetic test to your work. So far as I have read, no Homer has so delighted me since Chapman, but Chapman was quite guiltless of the fine Ionian flavour which you give so admirably.' But more important, perhaps, than the mere trans lation itself are the Dissertations and Notes prefixed, and much as I personally feel as to the import ance of these, I prefer again to quote my critic. ' They form an essential part of the purpose of the whole work \u2014 the presentation of the real Homer to modern readers. So completely has Professor Blackie had his eye fixed on this his main object, that he has omitted to discuss the authorship of the Odyssey, and the vexed questions connected with it. This is the one serious omission in the Dissertations. With this one exception, they form by far the best and ablest exposition of Homeric questions in English. As we have said already, English scholars have shamefully neglected this part of philology. The only important works on the subject are the works of men who are not professionally scholars \u2014 Gladstone, Grote, and Mure. Gladstone's is the work of a great intellect,"], [36, "16 AN APPRECIATION but it is written under very heavy disadvantages. He was unacquainted with almost the entire history of Homeric discussions on the Continent within the last fifty years, and with the books published during that period on the subject. In fact, he seems to have prejudged the whole matter, and therefore kept his eyes shut. Grote was well acquainted with the recent discussions, but it did not fall within his province to take up many of the Homeric questions. Mure, on the other hand, had both full knowledge of the litera ture and ought to have handled all the questions ; and in many respects his discussion is of great value. But he took up an entirely false position : he criticised Homer very much from the point of view of the last century. He regarded Homer evidently as a man of profound reflection ; he treats him as if he were a cultivated and widely-read poetic artist \u2014 in fact, he deals with him very much as he might deal with Milton ; and, therefore, he saw no necessity for dis cussing some of the most important Homeric questions. Professor Blackie has thus had a comparatively un occupied field ; and he certainly has done his work admirably. Every page teems with learning; but this learning is thoroughly under control. He shows a complete acquaintance with all the important works on Homer. He has gone in every case to the sources ; and he has discussed some of the questions \u2014 such as that on the amount of truth contained in tradition \u2014 with originality and insight. He has also compressed the results of his research into comparatively small compass. Some of the chapters \u2014 such as those on the state of the text and the labours of Zenodotus"], [37, "AN APPRECIATION 17 and Aristarchus and the Alexandrian critics generally \u2014 contain information that can be got nowhere else, except in monographs by German scholars, and now partially in Hayman. And these Dissertations have the merit of being very readable. Professor Blackie has managed to throw life and interest about many a dry point. Throughout all his discussions, Professor Blackie is conservative. He believes strongly in the unity of the Iliad, in a real Homer, in a real Trojan war, in a real Achilles and Agamemnon. He has contrived most skilfully to deepen this impression of reality as he goes on ; and somehow one gets to think that he knows more of Homer and the Trojan war from Professor Blackie's book than from any other author's whatever.' ' The mythological notes are in some respects the most important in the volume. The scientific treat ment of mythology, as exhibited in the writings of Otfried Miiller, Gerhard, Preller, Welcker, Schwartz, and others, is not represented by a single book in English ; and the student will find the results of these, so far as they pertain to Homer, stated for the first time in these notes. Professor Blackie deserves more than the credit of stating results. He has not merely exhibited the thoughts of others, but he has given the results of his own much-matured thought and original investigation.' ' The arch\u00e6ological notes are very curious. They show, perhaps more than anything else, the thorough ness with which Professor Blackie has mastered his subject. He has got hold of all the out-of-the-way discussions on Homeric zoology, botany, metallurgy, B"], [38, "18 AN APPRECIATION archery, armour, and other such matters ; and the reader will find information in these notes on the history of the arts and sciences at once interesting and rare.' In danger of losing the perspective of my apprecia tion, I have allowed myself to dwell further on this work than may seem advisable, but I am convinced that insufficient justice has been done by the reading world to these Dissertations and Notes, and I am also convinced that a separate re-publication of this part of the work would be acceptable to many scholars interested in these vexed questions. Of his translation of 'Faust,' I can add nothing to the high praise accorded by such men as Thomas Carlyle and George Henry Lewes, and for his masterly translation of \u00c6schylus, in which work Professor Blackie was seen at his best as a translator, it is sufficient to say that it eventually procured for him the Greek Chair in the University of Edinburgh. But, in my humble opinion, my uncle's best work is not to be found either in his ' Homer ' or his ' \u00c6schylus ' or in his ' Faust,' but firstly, in his con tributions to Blackwood and Tait and the Foreign Quarterly on German history and literature, and secondly, in his volume entitled 'The Wise Men of Greece.' It is impossible to speak too highly of the intimate knowledge of the German language, literature and spirit which enabled him to contribute so much that was important to our knowledge of that impor tant sphere of the world's history and literature, and the highest tribute there could be paid him, \u2014 tribute higher than even the praise of Carlyle, \u2014 was the"], [39, "AN APPRECIATION 19 praise and gratitude of many of the German critics. Writing shortly after his death, a contemporary said, ' Dr Kirchner writes for the Illustrirte Zeitung a notice of his career, full of appreciative criticism of his work, and of the sympathy with those who are mourning his loss. Written by a foreigner, the sketch is of special interest, as affording striking proof of the wide influence which, by his writings, Blackie acquired outside his own country, and also because it lays stress on a phase of his literary activity which we in Scotland have per haps hardly realised at its true value. \"We in Germany,\" says Dr Kirchner, \"owe grateful recogni tion to those who, by study and translation of our litera ture, use their best endeavours to win for it the apprecia tion of their countrymen. Among these John Stuart Blackie has a foremost place. Blackie has, in fact, done more than most men, as much as any one man except Thomas Carlyle, to bridge over the gap which unquestionably exists between the English and German mind, to clear away the thick atmosphere of miscon ception and prejudice which even Englishmen of wide culture find it difficult to ignore.\" ' The contributions to German literature and history include not only his ' Faust,' and the articles above mentioned, but also his ' Wisdom of Goethe,' a volume of precious gems translated from the works of the greatest of German poets. ' Having in my personal experience,' he says, ' had reason to thank God that at an early period of my life I became acquainted with the writings of this great man, it occurred to me that I could not do better service to the intelligent youth of this generation, for whom it has been my duty and"], [40, "AN APPRECIATION 20 pleasure to work through a long life, than to lay before them in a systematic form the most significant dicta on the important problems of sound thinking and noble living. As Dr Kirchner says, \" In these reflec tions, maxims and verses, it is not difficult to trace the master-mind that inspired Blackie's 'Self-Culture.'\"' Important also are Professor Blackie's numerous translations of the Studentenlieder, Volkslieder and War-songs of the Fatherland. Particularly the latter, all of them full of the true martial ring, the force and fire of the old Border ballads, including the transla tion of the 'Battle Prayer' of Korner 'Vater ich ruse dich' \u2014 the most beautiful of soldiers' prayers in the world's literature, ' Clouds from the thunder-voiced cannon envail me, Lightnings are flashing, death's thick darts assail me ; Ruler of battles, I call on thee, Father, O lead me ! ' Of 'The Wise Men of Greece,' I need only say that Professor Blackie considered this to be his most important contribution to literature. And when we come to examine the volume, we see in what a masterly and scholarly fashion he has portrayed ' the philosophical significance, the intellectual dignity and moral power,' of such men as Socrates, Pythagoras, Xenophanes and Empedocles. To quote his own words to Tom Taylor, ' I can only tell you that scholars and thinkers will get here no mere soap bubbles lightly blown for a summer's recreation, but the produce of hard work and years of study. I had no ambition, even if I had had the ability, to make a Pythagoras or an Empedocles, a mere mouthpiece"], [41, "AN APPRECIATION 21 to spout my sentiments. I strove everywhere to give a true picture of what was actually thought and said by these old worthies, or at least of what lay in their most distinctive maxims by plain implication ; and if the lines of the portraiture shall seem to agree in a very striking way, sometimes, with certain recent phases of modern thought, or the obvious opposite of these phases, this is not that I have interpolated any thing which, to the best of my judgment, did not lie in the original, but because the fundamental principles of all wisdom have always been present in the spiritual world wherever human beings in a normal state of culture have lived and thought. Reason is the light of the soul ; and though, like the sun in the heavens, it may be largely overclouded, and shine only by glimpses for a space, yet it is always there ; and the glimpse, whenever it appears, is a sure prophecy of the full radiance, which under favourable circum stances will surely be revealed.' The whole is comprised in a series of ten dramatic dialogues, which are as rich in language as they are in wisdom. Of his prose works, besides those I have mentioned, three stand out, \u2014 ' The Four Phases of Morals,' the essay ' On Beauty,' and ' Self-Culture.' In the first, to use the words of the present Professor of Moral Philo sophy in the University of Edinburgh, ' Professor Blackie has given us a valuable addition to ethical literature full of important exposition and criticism ; ' of the second ' On Beauty ; ' Dr John Brown had written, ' If I am mistaken not, there is more in the honest instincts, the broad sympathies, the genuine philosophy"], [42, "AN APPRECIATION 22 and cordial love of all that is lovable, as expressed in these discourses, to take and to hold, and to impress the great mass of thinking men and women, than in all else that our century has yet seen, not excepting my own great Ruskin.' Of ' Self-Culture ' I need not speak at length. It has been far and away the most widely circulated of all John Stuart Blackie's works, went through eleven editions in eight years, is now in its twenty-fifth, and has been translated into eleven different languages. As far north as the land of the Finns, south in the sunny lands of Italy and Spain, east of Suez amongst the many-tongued people of the Indian empire, this book has been read and re-iead. Its simple, robust, straightforward common sense, has made it a power of its kind, and a power for good, difficult to estimate. ' It is many years ago since I read his \" Self-Culture,\" wrote Professor Seth ; ' but it seemed to me then to be a masterpiece of its kind, full of the wisdom of life, ripe and true.' The germ of ' Self-Culture ' is in these words quoted in ' The Wisdom of Goethe ' \u2014 ' Every man must think for himself, and he will always find upon his path some truth or, at least, a kind of truth, that will keep him through life. Yet he dare not allow himself to drift. He must be self-controlled. Mere naked instinct does not become a man.' ' How can a man learn to know himself? ' asks Goethe, ' By reflection never, only by action. In the measure in which thou seekest to do thy duty shalt thou know what is in thee. But what is thy duty ? The demand of the hour.' In the region of poetry, from which I have selected for this volume many of the gems, besides his trans-"], [43, "AN APPRECIATION 23 lations from the German, the Greek and the Latin, we must not omit reference to his translations from the Gaelic. These are in most cases extremely faithful, and convey the spirit of the original in a remark able way. As an example, let me recommend the translation of Duncan Ban's ' Ben Dorain,' which will be found in this volume. As in an intro duction I have spoken of his chief contributions to verse in other directions, it is not necessary for me to dwell further upon the subject. It is not for me in this place to dwell on the many important affairs of a practical nature which engaged John Stuart Blackie throughout his life. These are all told in detail in Miss Stoddart's pages, and my reader will turn there for the history of the movement for university reform, the history of the foundation of the Celtic Chair, his endeavours in the question of reform in matters pertaining to education, his institu tion of travelling Greek fellowships, his work in the Greek and Latin classes, and last, but not least, the record of his persistent preaching in and out of season on the subject of the philological continuance of the Greek language and of the pronunciation of such. On this subject let me quote from a letter of M. Gennadius, ex-Envoy from the King of Greece. ' Greek newspapers received from Athens and other parts of Greece, contain obituary notices of the late Professor Blackie, all couched in terms of fond attach ment and affectionate respect for the memory of one who was considered as much Greek in heart and mind as those in the Levant who now mourn his loss. He had made himself more known among the Greek-"], [44, "AN APPRECIATION 24 speaking populations in the East, and he had entered more thoroughly into their habits of thought and modes of speech than many scholars who visited Greece more often, or sojourned longer there than he had done. It may even be said that he was more full of a vivid conception of the language and life of ancient and modern Greece than they. To what was this attributable? He learned, considered and taught Greek as a living, not as a dead language. He did not confine its ranges within the narrow and artificial limits of Atticism, or even of Classicism ; but recognised that Greek, as a tongue actually in use, has an unbroken record of 3000 years ; that contemporary Greek presents one of the most interest ing and most remarkable periods of an existence ever changing because ever alive. Finally, to quote from one of his letters to the Times, ' He did not perpetrate the English absurdity of pronouncing the language of Pericles and Plato with the vocalism of John Bull, and the accentuation of Old Cato, the Censor.' And before he died it was one of his greatest joys to learn that the seed he had sown was bearing fruit, and letters from M. Drakoules and others from Oxford and elsewhere, cheered him with the news that emancipation had begun. However many may differ as to the comparative merits and demerits of John Stuart Blackie's literary, academic and public works, no two opinions can be held with regard to the absolute sincerity and unassail able honesty of the man. Never have I met or heard of a man who was so absolutely truthful \u2014 truthful in word, truthful in deed \u2014 never did I know one who so"], [45, "AN APPRECIATION 25 absolutely refused to sacrifice one iota that a lie might be uttered or perpetuated. ' No dread of censure, and no lack of praise, Turned thee to right or left. ' If at times he seemed unreasonable in his persistency, it was because he was thoroughly convinced of the rectitude of his action. And this absolute honesty he carried into all his work. Here there was no trimming, no manufacture of facts to suit theories, his methods were absolutely scientific ; many may have disputed his opinions, none ever disputed his facts. He tells us, as Mr Morley says of Goethe, ' the whole truth.' Over and over again have I seen him spend what appeared a superfluous amount of time, to find out the accuracy of a statement or fact, and so careful was he to keep in control the know ledge which he possessed, so careful so as to have it stored away in his brain that it might be reproduced with accuracy, that he often used to say to me, \u2014 ' Don't tell me what you think, tell me what you know ! ' A good deal has been said with regard to Professor Blackie's supposed vanity. To me, who knew him in many phases of his mental and moral attitude, this charge of vanity is simply inexplicable. I never knew anybody so humble, so reverential, so careless of opinion. No vain man is humble, no vain man is truly reverential, every vain man is sensitive to a degree to opinion. Of course, he had tinges occasionally of what he called 'Oldie' (Old Adam), but so strong was his power of inhibition that these were quickly"], [46, "26 AN APPRECIATION trodden down. A vain man is never charitable to those who attack him \u2014 Professor Blackie never spoke a harsh word against any man in his life. Some have even mentioned his dress as an evidence of his vanity, but would it be news for the public to learn that he never knew when he had adorned himself with new clothes. At night-time the old clothes were removed and new ones were substituted, and he lived in ignorance of the fact. He was so much above the consideration of his sartorial environment, that had it not been for the kindly and studied care of his devoted wife, we are afraid he would have cut a very sorry figure indeed. That he was one of the most picturesque figures of the day was hardly his fault, and only arose from the fact that Mrs Blackie thought it no crime to dress a naturally handsome and pictur esque man in a picturesque manner. Of his charity, I cannot speak too highly. To an opponent he behaved in a manner that was often quixotic. He never judged harshly ; he never attri buted motives. When spiteful, sometimes cruel letters came to him, and we around his fireside gave vent to our honest indignation, in that sweet, fascinating way of his, he would bid us be charitable and would in many ways try to find a justification for the offender. Not that this ever detracted from his stern sense of duty which sometimes made him give vent to the expression, \u2014 'Bad boys should be thrashed.' As for what he gave away to the poor, only a very few knew his great, unostentatious liberality. This was one of the most beautiful traits of his character, and if he erred at all, it was that"], [47, "AN APPRECIATION 27 sometimes an unworthy person gained by the large ness of his heart. Many a poor, struggling literary man ; many a poor, weak, broken-down schoolmaster, or impoverished student has had cause to thank God that John Stuart Blackie was alive. ' Many a poor man and woman will miss the half-crown and the jest\u2014 that made the pocket a little heavier, and the heart a little lighter.' Of other marked characteristics may be mentioned his reverence and his patriotism. His reverence I have hinted at, and this virtue weighed so much with him, that it may with safety be said that it was the genesis of all his aspect to the Creator, and to the moral systems of the world. ' Think upon your knees,' was his metaphorical way of picturing the attitude of reverence which he deemed right in our intellectual life, and it was in this attitude that he himself went through life. Reverence for, not fear of, the great all-ruling ' logos ' of the Universe, the 'all-father,' the dispenser and reasoning ruler of all the wonders of nature. ' Write them Jove, Buddha, Allah, Elohim, Apollo, Krishna, Vishna, Great All-father Or great All-mother, if it please you rather, They are but names that sound one self-same theme, Soul of all souls, and of all causes cause.' And this reverence for the fatherhood was carried into the practical affairs of his life. It tempered his judgment, it made richer his charity, it broadened his conception of the variety of life. ' Keep yourself,' he wrote, 'always in an attitude of reverential depend ence on the supreme source of all good. It is the"], [48, "28 AN APPRECIATION most natural and speediest and surest antidote against that spirit of shallow self-confidence and brisk impertinence so apt to spring up with the knowledge without charity, which puffeth up and edifieth not.' One of his favourite, perhaps the favourite, of his illustrations bearing on this aspect of reverence was taken from Goethe, and may be quoted in his own translation of Goethe's words. ' There is one thing by means of which every man that is born into the world becomes truly manly. This thing is reverence, of which there are three kinds, or, if you will, three stages. These we endeavour to implant in the minds of our pupils with the symbolical accompaniment of three attitudes or postures. The first kind is reverence for that which is above us, and the attitude connected with this is that in which, with the arms crossed over the breast, our pupils are taught to look joyfully towards the heavens. By this we ask from them an ac knowledgment that there is a God on high, who reflects and reveals Himself in the person of parents, teachers and superiors. The second type is reverence for that which is beneath us. The hands clasped as though bound behind the back, the downward, smil ing look, in the attitude belonging to the type indicate that we should look upon the earth graciously and cheerfully, for it is the earth that affords us means of subsistence and the source of innumerable joys. But from this attitude we set our pupil free as soon as possible, the moment we are assured the lesson it is intended to convey has had its proper effect, then we call on him to brace himself like a man, and turning to his comrades to pit himself against them. Now he"], [49, "AN APPRECIATION 29 stands firm and bold, but not selfishly isolated. Only in conflict with his fellows can the young man learn to face the world. Our third attitude indicates this ; standing upright and with forward look, they take their stations no longer singly, but linked together in a row.' Then again. ' The religion which is founded on re verence for what is above us we call ethnic, or as it is in vulgar English, heathen. It is the religion of the nations, and the first happy deliverance from abject fear. To this class belong all pagan religions, whatever names they may bear. The second type of religion founded upon the reverence we cherish for what is on a par with ourselves, we call philosophical ; for the philosopher, who takes a central position, must draw down to his level what is above, while he seeks to elevate what is below ; and only when in this middle state does he deserve the name of a sage. The third type is that founded on reverence for what is beneath us \u2014 this is Christanity, for in it chiefly is this senti ment dormant. It is the highest step in the ladder of reverence to which humanity can obtain. . . . From these three embodied types spring the con summation of all reverences, the reverence for our self, out of which the other three again develop themselves.' And it is as well to note that he did not confuse the reverence for those great physical, intellectual, social and moral factors which in the ages have held the balance level for humanity, with that blind respect and worship of things born in prejudice, bred in ignorance, and perpetuated in mysticism. He was"], [50, "AN APPRECIATION 30 always of the north and western world, though in fluenced by the wisdom which came from the east and south, and he had no respect for what would clog the higher developments of his human brothers. When we come to analyse the Professor's religious belief, we find, as I have said, this reverence at the root of it all, and in the aspect of worship we find how wide, almost pantheistic, was his conception of the worship of the Creator. It was really, when we look at it, the first verse of the 19th psalm, and no choir, no chorus of human voices in any temple made by hands was half as expressive to him as the choir, whose units were the rippling brook, the roaring cataract, the heaven pointing hills, and the changing clouds. ' Go not where sculptured tower or pictured dome Invites the reeking city's jaded throngs, Some hoar old shrine of Rhine-land or of Rome Where the dim aisle the languid hymn prolongs, Here rather follow me and take thy stand By the grey cairn that crowns the lone Dunee, And let thy breezy worship be the grand Old Bens, and the old grey knolls that compass thee ; The sky-blue waters and the snow white sand, And the quaint isles far sown upon the sea. ' And again, at Ardlui, \u2014 In sooth a goodly temple, walled behind With crag precipitous of granite grey, And by green birches corniced, which the wind Sowed o'er the rim in random rich display. And for a roof the azure-curtained hall, Light-floating cloud and broad benignant ray, And organed by the hum of waterfall And plash of bright waves in the gleaming bay. And here's the pulpit, the huge granite mass Erect, frost-sundered from the mossy crown"], [51, "AN APPRECIATION 31 And there the people sit on turfy grass, And here the fervid preacher thunders down ; Go kneel beneath Saint Paul's proud dome and say, If God be nearer there, or here to-day. ' And again, in Arran, in that most eloquent pantheistic poem, ' A Sabbath Meditation ' \u2014 ' In the high-domed fane, Glorious with all the legendary pomp Of pictured saints, where skilful singers swell The curious chant, or on the lonely hill Where, on grey cliff and purple heather shines The shadowless sun at noon. Thou hears't alike. Vainly the narrow wit of narrow men Within the walls which priestly lips have blest, In the fixed phases of a formal creed Would crib Thy presence ; Thou art more than all The shrines that hold Thee ; and our wisest creeds Are but the lispings of a forward child To spell the Infinite.' And finally, in his eloquent apology for the poor Hindoos in his ' Trimurti.' ' Farewell ! your creed may nevermore be mine, I hold one God, but many forms Divine ; Your's best \u2014 so be it ! but I may not bind My heart to worship only in one kind ; Nor where flowers prink the mead with diverse hue Let one bright bloom usurp my wondering view ; And they are wise who love with like regard Both rose and lily, where to choose is hard. Leave me, my friend, the luxury of my error, To think that creeds are but a broken mirror With thousand suns for one that lights the skies, And one truth imaged in a thousand lies ! ' God, to him, was soul of all soul and substance of all creeds, and his interpretation of the meaning of the Trinity, was Thought, Word and Deed. Thought, the Father, Deed, the Son, and Word the Holy Spirit. His religion 'was one glowing furnace hot"], [52, "AN APPRECIATION 32 with moral emotion rather than the outcome of a theo logy bristling with stereotyped dogma and scholastic formulas.' It was a religion of action, of morals, of personal inhibition. In a sonnet to Mr Findlay of Aberlour, a wise and good landlord, he said : \u2014 Not all who catch the breeze can guide the ship, Not all who mount the car can rein the steed, Not all can quaff good wine with sober lip, Some make their lives a slander on their creed. His ship was ever off the rock, not always riding smoothly, for \u2014 ' Far better to be tempest driven Than rot upon the harbour mud,' but never stranded. With a steady hand he reined the steed, and his temperate, guileless and noble life was a better demonstration of his religious belief than all the creeds his lips could utter. It was the love of the natural in religion that made him such an admirer of the \u00e6sthetic in places of worship which, indeed, inspired him in a sonnet to his old friend Dr M'Gregor of St Cuthbert's to write : \u2014 ' Thou are wise to feel The pulse of the time and from high mitred station Bring chant and hymn with soul compelling power To fling a grace in worship's praiseful hour O'er the grave-visaged Presbyterian nation.' No doubt, much of the reverence in his nature helped to keep alive that intense passion for Father land which coloured most of his utterances on educa tional and social questions. Reverence for those who"], [53, "AN APPRECIATION 33 had secured for Scotland their civil liberty at Bannock burn and their religious liberty at Drumclog. To use the words of his friend, 'the wise young laird of Dalmeny,' as he was fond of calling Lord Rosebery, 'When we forget our individual national life as Scotsmen, you may be sure the history of Scotland has come to an end. The principle of nationality, I take to be this, that we should cling to everything essential to us as a historical nation, and because we are a historical nation we should remember with all the more pride that we are one of many nations that go to make up the greatest empire the world has ever seen.' Patriotism in the abstract to him was one of the greatest virtues of citizenship, and it hurt his right feelings of pride for the great historical traditions of his country, to see his countrymen forgetting that these traditions ever existed, that we never had a distinct national character, that we never inherited a distinc tive type of manhood from the past, forgetting that Scotland was something more than a northern pro vince of England. He himself rejoiced every day in the traditions and heritages of his beloved country \u2014 the traditions of civil and religious strifes and conquest, the heritages of poetry and of song. As I have said, patriotism in the abstract he counted among the higher virtues, and it is with this view that we hear him speak in such high terms of the three greatest national demonstrations he had witnessed \u2014 the first, when the German troops entered Berlin after the Franco-German war ; the second, the Jubilee pro cession in London in 1887 ; and the third, when he himself at Bannockburn, in the presence of thousands c"], [54, "AN APPRECIATION 34 of the Scottish people, unfurled the banner on the Borestone. This was not the only occasion on which he took the principal part in a demonstration markedly Scottish in character. Some years ago he inaugurated a monu ment to Peden at Cumnock, in the presence of four thousand people; and in 1864, he made one of his most eloquent public appearances, when at Sanquhar he was present at the inauguration of an obelisk at the market cross, the place where Richard Cameron and his compatriots published their famous ' Declaration,' and which, eight years after, shook the Stuarts from the throne. ' There, then and afterwards,' in the words of Mr Tod, ' at the Old Castle, Blackie delivered great and glowing speeches ; and in reference to the per secuted Covenanters, thundered out the lines carved upon the tall column : \u2014 ' If you would know the nature of their crime, Then read the story of that killing time.' He loved to the end his 'ain Doric,' the sibilants of his 'ain braid Scots,' that language which Ruskin, in a letter to me, spoke of as 'the sweetest, subtlest, richest, most musical of all the living dialects of Europe,' he loved his Scottish songs, he loved the Scottish people, he loved his Scottish land. ' I've fed my eyes by land and sea, With sights of grandeur streaming o'er me, But still my heart remains with thee, Dear Scottish land, that stoutly bore me. O, for the land that bore me ! O, for the stout old land ! With mighty ben, and winding glen, Stout Scottish land \u2014 my own, dear land.'"], [55, "AN APPRECIATION 35 In conclusion, perhaps it is not necessary for me to state that John Stuart Blackie was essentially, in all the elements that made up his personality, a man of affirmation, a man of action. The mere apostle of negation, the mere cynic, the mere looker-on, the mocker, may interest or startle for the moment, only to perish like a flash of lightning. Blackie often startled, but the intellectual or moral agitation aroused in his hearers or readers rose not from the dreary still-birth of negations, or the dead bones of pessimistic diatribes, but rather from a too glowing assertion, per haps, of some living potent maxim or problem touch ing something that had a living bearing on human hopes and human aspirations. Many of us may have been annoyed at his persistency, but he believed with Herbert Spencer, that ' only by varied iteration can alien conceptions be forced on reluctant minds.' Whether the high priests of the higher criticism, the door-keeper of the dovecots of the purists in style, will admit him into their sanctum is a different ques tion. Like a very opposite man, Voltaire, he rated literature much lower than truth and action. He never was a mere literary man, he had too strong a personality for that, and in all he wrote that person ality was not lost sight of. It is not a matter, then, for much surprise that this Happy Warrior, fighting to the end with his sword in hand for what he thought to be right, absolutely sincere, generous-hearted, 'a man without guile,' patriotic, reverential, should become beloved at home, revered abroad. Loved by his peers, loved by the high, loved by the low; \u2014 his bright, rich,"], [56, "36 AN APPRECIATION overflowing presentation, a lovable sight surely for gods and men. We will forgive him slapping the episcopal knee of Thirlwall, and for shaking Carlyle when he would not let his wife speak, because we knew how much of it was the result of his abnormal physical and mental vigour. No one could come near him without being im pressed with the greatness of his personality ; and no young man certainly could fail to be impressed with the spirit of a joy in all things of good report, could not avoid being impressed by him by his creed, that ' this is a world of stern realities.' All his in fluence was for good, ' in an age of pessimism he held high the banner of human hope and human aims.' 'Speaking the truth in love,' and 'All noble things are difficult,' were his favourite mottoes ; mottoes which helped him over many a hard stile in this, as he called it, ' pleasant pilgrimage.' He went through life working and singing. ' If you wish to be happy in this world, there are only three things that can secure you of your aim \u2014 the love of God, the love of truth, and the love of your fellowmen ; and of this divine triad, the best and most natural exponent in my estimate is, neither a sermon, nor a lecture, nor even a grand article in a quarterly review, but just simply a good song.' ' Rocking on a lazy billow With roaming eyes, Cushioned on a dreamy pillow Thou art not wise. Wake the power within thee sleeping, Trim the plots that's in thy keeping, Thou wilt bless the task when reaping Sweet labour's prize."], [57, "AN APPRECIATION 37 Work and wait, a sturdy liver (Life fleetly flies), Work and pray, and sing, and ever Lift hopeful eyes. Let no flaring folly din thee, Wisdom when her charm may win thee, Flows a well of life within thee, Young man, be wise.' Born on 25th July 1809, John Stuart Blackie passed on the 2nd of March 1895 mt0 the valley of the dark shadow, within the 'door which, opening, letting in, lets out no more,' and was buried with all the honours which a city and nation could command, on March 6th. As Mr George Stronach says, ' everybody he loved, but not a tithe of those who loved him, was there to pay him a last homage ; Edinburgh, particularly the High Street, presenting a spectacle which has never been seen since the execution of Montrose, and will never again be seen in our days. ' I have seen,' he says, ' many impressive sights in historic St Giles' Cathedral, but nothing to equal the awful solemnity and the last honour paid to the great Scotsman, of whom we were all so justly proud. Rich and poor, high and low, the learned and the unlearned were gathered outside or inside the famous old shrine, and there were few dry eyes in the great crowd when the funeral car slowly made its way to the church.' But, as Professor Geddes puts it, ' the broad Cathedral was but the sounding chancel, the square and street, the silent transept and nave. Psalm and prayer, chorus and organ rolled their deepest, yet the service had a climax beyond the hallelujah, the pipes, as they led the procession slowly out, giving the \" Land of the"], [58, "38 AN APPRECIATION Leal \" a new pathos, and stirring the multitude with a penetrating and vibrating intensity, which is surely in no other music. The big man beside me broke down and sobbed like a child ; the lump comes back to one's own throat, the eyes dim again as one re members it. It was a new and strange instrument ; strangest perhaps to those who knew well its musical call to dance, its demoniac scream and thrill of war. . . . In front went a long procession of societies headed by kilt and plaid ; behind came the mourning kinsmen, with the advocates, the Senate, the students and the Town Council in their varied robes ; then the in terminable carriages of personal friends. But better than all these, the town itself was out ; the working people in their thousands and tens of thousands lined the way from St Giles' to the Dean ; the very windows and balconies were white with faces. Coming down the Mound, in full amphitheatre of Edinburgh, filled as perhaps never before, with hushed assemblage of city and nation, the pipers suddenly changed their song. . . . For those who were not there, the scene is well nigh as easy to picture as us to recall ; the wavy lane, close-walled with drawn and deepened faces, the long black procession marching slow, sprinkled with plaid and plume, crowded with college cap and gown, with civic scarlet and ermine, marshalled by black draped maces. In the midst the Black Watch pipers, march ing their slowest and stateliest \u2014 then the four tall black maned horses \u2014 the open bier, with plain, unpolished oaken coffin high upon a myriad of flowers, a mound of tossing lilies, with Henry Irving's lyre of violets, \" To the beloved Professor,\" its silence fragrant at its"], [59, "AN APPRECIATION 39 foot. Upon the coffin lay the Skye women's plaid, above his brow the Prime Minister's wreath, but on his breast a little mound of heather, opening into bloom.' When on that spring morning the Scottish people had laid him to rest in the Dean Cemetery, he went as one of the last of those who had stood together in the days when his arm was strongest.

Pleased with his eye with the muster, but rested At length where he sate with an anxious love, When he thought on the strife of the mighty broad- breasted Poseidon, with Pallas, the daughter of Jove ; For the god of the earth-shaking ocean had sworn it, The city of Cecrops should own him supreme, Or the land and the people should ruefully mourn it, Swamped by the swell of the broad ocean-stream.

Not for earth's wealth or dominion contend we ; The holiest rights of the freeman defend we. Victor or vanquished, praise I Thee ! God, in Thy name I trust ! God, in Thy name I trust ! When in loud thunder my death-note is knelling, When from my veins the red blood is welling, God, in Thy holy name I trust ! Father, I call on Thee !
