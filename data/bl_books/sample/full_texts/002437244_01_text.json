THE LUTHER VILLAGE ON THE SAXON MOOES. \" Thank the powers and the ' extra post, ' \" we said to ourselves, as the postilion cracked his whip and blew his bugle on entering the queer mud-built little place, \" at last we are in Mohra \u2014 Mohra, the native place of Hans Luther, the great German Pieformer's father, and from time immemorial the home of the ancient Luther family.\" In Mohra ! a little village on the outskirts of the Thuringian forest, a good thousand miles away from London, and at least an hour's journey from any town in which there is either a post-office, a money-changer's, or even a butcher's or a baker's shop. Linen-drapers and apothecaries, \u2014 those twin children of luxury, begotten by the astute love of having one's daughters, as well as one's dinners, richly-dressed, \u2014 have long since disappeared from the thoroughfares during our journey; and now (for we write this description in Mohra itself), the principal hotel in the place has no greater delicacy in its larder than black puddings \u2014 or \" red sausages \" as the Germans style them \u2014 and black bread, with a chopin or two of \" einfaches,\" (or literally, infinitesimally-small) beer, for the regalement of the traveller. But whereabouts is this Mohra? \u2014 this primeval home, whither crinolines and dinner-pills have not yet made their way \u2014 this land of ox-wa\"ons, rather than locomotives, where the ladies wear truncated black-silk extinguishers, in the place of \" sailors' hats \""], [20, "4 GEBMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. and the gentlemen incase their feet in Holzpantoffeln (wooden slippers), instead of \"patent leathers.\" Where on the earth is this little Arcadian colony to be found ? Search the best map in Germany, and even with the strongest magnifying glass you will not discover the name of the locality ; Murray, too, is \"reticent\" (to adopt the pet phrase of modern litterateurs) on the subject; and even the guide-books, specially descriptive of the topography of Thuringia, tell you only that, as you walk over from Eisenach to \" Bad Liebenstein,\" you can just see, when a little way beyond Etterwinden, the church-steeple to the right bristling above the horizon. What may be the precise latitude and longitude of the \" Dorf che.n \" (literally Thorpkin) bearing the name of Mohra, Heaven and Sir John Herschel only know. Suffice it to learn that it lies on the borders of Saxe-Meiningen, close to Saxe-Weimar, not above an hour or two from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and, indeed, in the immediate vicinity of Saxe-Everything. For, in these parts, kingdoms are as closely packed as parishes in the city of London, and princes swarm as thickly as beadles about St. Paul's on the Anniversary of the Sons of the Clergy. Accordingly, when mid way between Marksuhl and Salzungen (as the railway whisks us through the Thuringian forest from Eisenach to Meiningeu), the watchful eye may \"sight\" the little village, consisting of about as many houses as there are in a child's box of toys, with the cottages huddled together under the lee of the hills, \u2014 like a flock of sheep in a storm \u2014 and lying far away on the moors (der Moor grundj from which the townikin, or city-cule, or boroughlet, or wick ling, (whichever you please, dear reader) is said to derive its name. The village itself is about the same size and shape as the tongue-like block of buildings dividing the Strand from Holywell Street, and consists of some seventy or eighty detached houses (mostly with large farmyards adjoining them) arranged in two long parallel lines, called respectively the Upper and Under Lanes. It contains about as many distinct families as there are houses, and numbers altogether just upon six times as many inhabitants as amilies, or not quite 500 men, women, and children ; so that the whole population might be comfortably stowed away in a middling sized garrison, a factory, an emigrant ship, or even the gallery of the Victoria Theatre. Indeed, the little church, whose nave is hardly bigger than one of our large furniture vans, affords ample accommodation for all the church-goers, even though none but the very little children stay away."], [21, "THE LUTHER VILLAGE. 5 The people here are mostly Acker-baucrn (literally acre-peasants) and day-labourers (Tage-lvhner), and possess altogether, among them, some 4000 acres of land ; for such is the extent of the \" Gemeinde,\" i. e. of the entire landed property belonging to the little community. Now this would give an average of about half a hundred acres to each of the four- score families located in the village. Some, however, have as many as 150 and even 200 acres, and many, ou the other hand, only one ; while, owing to the law of \" Gavelkind \" which prevails here, and gives to each member of the family an equal share of the land, on the decease of the former proprietor, the soil has come to be so divided and sub divided, that even they who are lucky enough to hold more than a hundred acres, are the owners of as many different strips of land, situate in as many different places. Hence the large farms in Mohra are merely an aggregation of petty ones, made up of an infinite variety of small patches, like a beggar's coat ; and what would go far to constitute a comparatively wealthy yeoman in other parts, serves merely to establish a magnified form of Irish cottier in these. It is superfluous, therefore, to add that all the appliances of \"high-farming'' are entirely unknown in Mohra; indeed, the best idea we can give the reader as to the utter absence of all such implements as reaping machines, or threshing machines, even in the largest \" economies \" (as the farms are called) in the village, is to cite the fact that, during our stay at the school-master's house there, the daughter of the burgomaster (for even Mohra has its mayor) came over to dance one evening, and after waltzing for an hour or so begged to retire, though it was barely eight, saying she was sorry she was obliged to leave so soon, but she had to be up at one in the morning to go thresh ing in her father's barn. In a town consisting mainly of peasants, of course handicrafts men and mechanics cannot be expected to flourish. There is only one carpenter among the Mohra population, and even he, from dearth of work at his own trade, has been forced to take to the more lucrative occupation of swineherd. One shoemaker, too, is there in the village ; but, said the pastor of the place to us, \"Neither does he thrive, poor man!'' Nor are there any builders, for the houses are all of the \" wattle and dab \" style of structure, so that neither masons nor bricklayers are required, where the walls consist only of mud and wicker-work, rather than bricks or stones. On the other hand, not less than eight, or just a tithe of the four-score householders in the little colony, are"], [22, "6 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. woodcutters\u2014 a fact which is not only suggestive of the sylvan character of the country round about, but recalls the story of Hans Luther having followed the same occupation in these parts, as well as of Martin's mother having often carried home the bundles on her back, with her little ones, each laden with a faggot on his head, trotting by her side. As we walked out towards Lauterbach early the other morning, we met several of these Mohra woodmen trudging along to the woods, some with their huge saws slung quiver-like at their back (the shark-like teeth stuck in a narrow wooden groove, or \"sheath,\" as it is called, by way of protection) and with their hatchets over their shoulder ; and others with a long bill-hook, that seemed like an attenuated note of interrogation, borne, as if it were a halberd, high in the air. Even the few handicraftsmen numbered among the village population can hardly be said to be handicraftsmen proper, being rather a kind of mongrel type \u2014 half-boor, half artizan ; for the smiths and the tailors are, many of them, small farmers ; while the weavers, like the woodcutters, ply their trade only in the winter, and in the summer abandon the shuttle, as the others lay aside the axe, for the sickle and the scythe, the spade and the hoe. Indeed, the two watchmen, whose duty it is alternately to guard the tiny colony by night, and to sound every hour on a horn under the windows of the sleeping peasants, from bedtime till day-break ; and who are allowed a pair of strong shoes every year, in consideration of their continually parading the streets from night till morning \u2014 even these are the cowherd and swineherd of the little community by day ; one half of their time taking care of the villagers themselves, and the other half minding their cattle and their pigs. Nor are the officials \u2014 the temporal and spiritual authorities of the hamlet \u2014 of a less agrarian character ; for the Herr Pastor has his flock, not only in a figurative, but in a literal sense of the term, aud finer sheep cannot be seen for miles around. The schoolmaster, on the other hand, is renowned for breeding the biggest calves in the parish, and cultivates early peas and young potatoes as well as youthful intellects ; while the burgomaster, or Schultheiss, as he was called till a few years back, is simplv the greatest boor in the parish ; and being a kind of petty magistrate as well as a small farmer, dispenses a rude form of agrarian jus tice, and cuts his chaff with equal alacrity. The one policeman, indeed, who constitutes the entire \" execu-"], [23, "THE LUTHER VILLAGE. 7 tive \" portion of the village Government, is the only official who seems to have a pure and unmixed vocation ; though we doubt much whether he is not occasionally pressed into the rural service, and set to scare the crows off the land at sowing-time, as well as to drive away the beggars at other seasons. But if there are few pure mechanics and artizans, there are still fewer tradesmen in Mohra : if the manufactures do not flou rish there, at least one might expect to find some faint indication of commerce \u2014 were it only as much as a chandler's store \u2014 in the neighbourhood. But no ! you might as well look for a shop in Belgrave Square as in the Ober-and Unter-gasse of the Thuringian village ! Not a goldsmith's, nor a magazin des modes, nor a hair dresser's, nor a bookseller's, nor a maison de deuil, nor a pastry cook's, nor a doctor's, nor a banker's \u2014 no ! nor a pawnbroker's establishment exists in the place. Neither is there a club-house, a casino, a theatre, a cafe chantant, a billiard-room, a mechanics' institute, a salon de lecture \u2014 nor even a prison \u2014 to be found from one end of the village to the other. The Gasthaus, or hostelry, indeed, is the only Magazin in the place \u2014 the Wilde Mohr (or \" Savage Blackamoor,\" as the inn is called) doing the solitary bit of trade carried on in the parish ; for there, and there only, are coffee, sugar, candles, tobacco, and salt retailed, together with the most watery beer and the most fiery \" Schnapps,\" to the villagers. Once during the fortnight which we passed in the neighbour hood, we saw an enterprising pedlar go up the Rohrigs-gasse with a string of felt over shoes and slippers dangling from his hand. But beyond this bold venture on the hawker's part, and the sight of an occasional horse being shod outside one of the smiths' doors, there was not a sign of trade or commerce visible in the whole parish. So that one went along wondering what on earth the boors did with their money, or whether they really had any at all of the current tissue paper of the realm in their possession ; for, as they generally pay their wages in kind, and grow, not only their own food, but also the shirts and chemises, coats and petti coats of the entire family, it was not at all improbable that even the richest bauers, though they might be worth some thousands in pigs, cows, sheep, and land, had hardly a paper thaler, or a plated groschen to bless themselves with. What the amusements of such a people may be, beyond the annual excitement of the Eirmes (the harvest festival), the occa sional jollification of a Feiertag (a general holiday), the mild de-"], [24, "GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. light of a glass of einfaches Bier at the tavern on the Sunday evening, or the spasmodic pleasure of seeing a pig killed once every half year, we cannot presume to say. But certainly, so far as we saw, there was not a pack of cards, nor a chess-board, nor a newspaper, aud hardly a book, in the place. The grown-up folk seemed to be in the barn and out in the fields, and the young ones in the school, from daybreak till nightfall ; so that, by the time they had given the pigs their supper and finished their own, and the cattle had been bedded up for the night, they were too ready for rest themselves to beheve that there was any better enjoyment of an evening than sleep. Nor have the women and girls any more time for pleasure than the men. A German, \" who has seen the world \" is generally horrified at what he calls the laziness of English and American wives and daughters ; and assuredly in Deutschland the female portion of the population work as hard as the cows. Mohra, too, makes no exception to the national rule ; for, Heaven knows, there is not much embroidery-work done by the ladies there. On the contrary, the daughters, even of the richest bauers in the vil lage, rise usually at one in the morning throughout the \" fore winter \" (as it is called) to go threshing in the barn, and continue working away with the flail till breakfast-time ; after which the barn-floor is swept, and the girls proceed to break and swingle flax, till four in the evening, when they have to give the pigs their supper, and bed up the cattle for the night. Then the family Abend mahi (evening meal) is got ready, and by the time this is finished, it is generally six or seven o'clock, which, at that season of the year, is the usual hour for bed. In the \" after winter,\" i.e. from Christmas till the spring-time, the invariable occupation is spinning \u2014 spinning from six in the morning till ten at night \u2014 the flax that before Christmas they had been engaged in dressing. At this employment the men take part, even as the girls take their share of the more masculine work with the flail. In the spring, on the other hand, the Mddchen are busy in the meadows, bleaching the linen after the yarn has been made into cloth by the webster ; they have also then to be out in the fields, scattering the manure over the land, or else planting the potatoes, or hoeing the \" Swedes,\" or picking the stones off tbe earth. Next, as the summer comes round, they must dig up the \" earth apples,\" as the Dutch style them, help to make the hay, reap the corn, bind up the shocks, and gather the fruit. Nor is the labour list ended here : at every season of the year the girls must do all"], [25, "9 THE LUTHER VILLAGE. the washing of the household, as well as bake all the bread, chop all the sausage-meat, milk all the cows, besides fetching from the well all the water that is required for the cattle or the family, and carrying each time some ten gallons (100 lbs. weight) of fluid upon their backs in long conical tubs called Butten, that are strapped on to the shoulders. Indeed, it was while the burgo master's daughter was engaged in this not-particularly- lady-like oc cupation, that we first had the pleasure of meeting that young lady. Such heavy work as this is, of course, to English minds, more fit for sturdy men than weak women ; and it forms by no means a pleasing picture to a person of the least refinement, to see a young girl with her body bent almost double, staggering along under the burden of nearly a hundred weight of fluid. Never theless, in Germany, a brother would rather have his sister drop with such a load than offer to carry it for her. The people tell you it is thought a disgrace for a man to be seen bearing burdens ; but they do not, on the other hand, consider it in any way un manly to allow a woman to do so. Accordingly, it is by no means an unusual sight to meet a market-woman, on the road to one of the large towns on a Saturday, with the Eorb on her back, laden to the nape of her neck, while the husband at her side calmly trudges along, with nothing but a stick in one hand and a pipe in the other ; the poor Frau labouring and panting away to keep up with her hulking and callous spouse. But if the villagers are primitive and unpolished, assuredly the village itself is of the same character. It is, indeed, a kind of mud Switzerland \u2014 a little colony of clay \" chalies,\" with their huge gables and broad eaves turned towards the road ; their doors, with porches as capacious as those of a country church, set at ihe side rather than the front of the houses ; and their bread and prune ovens, like enormous mud-heaps under a rude canopy of tiles, jutting out into the roadway. The walls of most of the houses are of a bright gingerbread colour, with the framework of iron-grey timbers showing, like a large trellis, through the \"wattle and dab \" work. Others are coloured a light pea-green, or a pale cream, and upon these the huge check pattern of the dark un painted beams stands out, with all the force of black and white, like a gigantic shepherd's plaid. Some of the square compartments of plaster between the wooden framework, are ornamented with the most unartistic attempts at pictures of roses, tulips, and prancing horses ; roses like kidneys, tulips hke monster brandy-balls, and horses like"], [26, "10 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. rampant weasels. At the side of each house too, stands the farm yard, with its enormous barn, as big as a Lambeth Music Hall (for all the corn here is garnered, rather than stacked), stretching right across one side of the mucky quadrangle ; whilst, at frequent intervals, along each, or rather either, of the streets, there are wells of all forms and dimensions, from the double bucket dangling over a pulley the size of a railway wheel, down to the old Roman apparatus of a gigantic fishing rod, with a chain and pail at the upper end of it, instead of a hook and line. The thoroughfares, moreover, are littered on either side with one long broken Hne of ploughs and empty carts, which are left outside of nearly every door, with an utter disregard of both weather and thieves ; and these, with the exception of a procession or two of geese, filing along, and cackling away, out in the middle of the road, are all that is to be seen in the streets of Mohra. But the main feature of the little village is the spot where the Wirthshaus \u2014 the principal (because the only) tavern \u2014 thrusts its little tin flag of a sign, no bigger than a child's pocket-handker chief, out into the roadway. The sage, who stood godfather to the hostelry, and gave it its name of zum Wilden Mohren, evidently imagined that the wild moors, spoken of as having surrounded the village in former times, were a horde of barbarian black men, rather than part of a vast uncultivated bog ; and hearing that the village itself derived its title from these same moors of old, believed he could not do better than set up the portrait of some pot-valiant blackamoor for the insignia of the first hotel in the place. Accordingly, the tavern sign consists of a rude painting of the ideal black bandit, on his prancing Arab steed, with a sabre in one hand, and a pot of einfaches Bier in the other ; as if he were bidding the customers (like Queen Eleanor did Fair Rosamond in the good old times of Hairy the Second) choose between the steel and the poison. And now for a word or two about the costume of the people in this primitive little Saxon Arcadia. The young women have all tall black silk head-dresses, in shape like truncated sugar-loaves, stuck right on the crown of the head, and with the back embroidered with spangles and beads, and with long broad streamers of black ribbon reaching down to the waist. The front of this Deckel-miitze, as it is termed, is arched over either eyebrow, and has a long, narrow tongue, called the Schnauze (literally, the snout), dividing the forehead into two semi-circular compartments, and reaching almost to the bridge of"], [27, "11 THE LUTHER VILLAGE. the nose. The fashion, it must be confessed; is more peculiar than pretty, and is too strongly suggestive of the long pendulous excrescence dangling over a turkey-cock's beak to be in the least pleasing. The rest of the peasant-girl's costume consists of a small short-waisted cloth jacket, with high-shouldered leg-of mutton sleeves, and a linsey-woolsey petticoat, with plaits as thick as the folds of a fan all round the waist, and the skirts cut very short, so as to afford an ample view of the blue-grey stockings, with their showy \"clocks,\" and the neat embroidered shoes that finish the \" full-length.\" Some of the Mddchen in the neighbourhood are of enormous height. The burgomaster's daughter, though not sixteen years old, stood nearly five feet ten in her shoes ; and we saw one young woman who was ouly in her seventeenth year, and yet might have looked over the head of some of our Life-Guardsmen. Their features, too, are more regular than those of the German women generally, the cheek-bones being a little less sharp and angular, the nose somewhat less broad and flat, the nostrils less like an inverted \" accent circomflexe,\" and the mouth not merely a long straight gash in the face. The more elderly among the peasant-women wear nearly the same dress as the younger ones, except that the Miitze with them is somewhat dumpier, the peak or \" snout\" of it somewhat longer, and the back of it a shade less elaborately embroidered and bespangled than those of the girls. Indeed, so marked a characteristic is the high cap and short petticoats of the female portion of the peasantry in these parts, that amidst the 500 souls making up the entire population of the village, there were only two dames astute enough to wear bonnets; and these were, in the words of our informant, the Frau Wirthin and the Frau Pastorin \u2014 or, in plain English, the one was the wife of the innkeeper and the other the wife of the minister of the village ; the last-mentioned lady having been represented to us as being especially vornehm (stylish), from the fact that she not only carried a Hut (bonnet), but had her dresses made down to her heels also. The fashions for the gentlemen are somewhat of the same un gainly character. Such of the boors as are attached to the more ancient institutions of their country wear for full-dress, on the Sundays and holidays, a kind of postilion's jacket, leather breeches, and high Wellington boots, the latter being made in the same style as those worn by the coachmen at a London funeral."], [28, "12 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Others, however, who delight to appear in the newest mode, lay aside the ancient postilion's jacket, and sport a kind of green duffle dressing-gown, with leg-of-mutton sleeves, which the village \" bloods\" have got to consider more stylish as full dress within the last fifty years. The same continuations, however, are invariably worn on high-days and holidays \u2014 unless, indeed, the undertaker boots be exchanged for a pair of old-Freneh-Guard like gaiters ; and these, with either a huge funnel-shaped hat, as rough as a Shetland pony, or else a woolly fez-cap of sheep-skin, constitute the approved Sunday toilet among the better class of peasant proprietors. A peculiar social custom among these simple village-folk is the mode in which the girls select what they call their \" Cameraden\" (female companions) and \" keep company\" with the boys whom they have accepted as sweethearts. In the house in which we lodged there were two young women \u2014 Augusta and Amelia, the well-behaved and hard-working daughters of the village schoolmaster \u2014 the one sixteen yeare of age, and the other, perhaps, some couple of years her senior. Each of these girls had a different set of \" comrades ;\" nor did the companions of the one sister associate with those of the other. Amelia's comrades, for instance, consisted of the younger girls, who had just left school ; and those of Augusta (the elder sister) of the grown young women of the village : and when either sister had to receive her comrades and their sweethearts at home, the other was obliged to go out to one of her own com rades' house, and pass the evening there ; for she was never allowed to remain in the society of her sister's companions. During the threshing season, it is usual for each of the maiden's comrades to take it in turn to give a \" reception\" to the others and then- Schatz (sweethearts) every Sunday evening ; but in the after-winter, immediately the spinning season begins, the com pany meet at one or other of the girls' houses every evening, instead of once every week, each bringing her lover and her spinning-wheel with her ; and there they all sit round the room, spinning (boys and girls alike), singing and courting, without anything to eat or drink, till bed-time. But not only is this separation of society into two classes of companions, according to age, limited to the girls and young women of the village, but the same division holds good among the boys and young men likewise ; for Amelia's comrades would not have allowed one of their Gesellschaft to bring a lover among"], [29, "THE LUTHER VILLAGE. 13 them who was above the approved age for their society ; any more than Augusta's comrades would have admitted into their company a Schatz who was considered too youthful for them to associate with. Indeed, the burgomaster's daughter, who hap pened to be one of Amelia's comrades, had the misfortune to be engaged to a young boor, the bristly condition of whose whiskers rendered him admissible only to the Gesellschaft of the elder sister Augusta ; and, consequently, the wretched Heinrich had to con sole himself, all through the spinning-season, with the tantalizing pleasure of taking his beloved \"Lisschen\" to her comrade's house, and leaving her and her wheel at the door, and then calling for both again when all the fun was finished."], [30, "CHAPTEB II. ' THE BEGGAR BARONS \" OF THURINGIA. The history of Germany shows that the Teutonic nobles hardly ever ranked higher than thieves and beggars in the eyes of the rest of Europe. According to Campanus, who was one of the apostolic Nuncios in the Middle Ages, the whole country then was one vast den of titled robbers ; for he says, \" the greater the noble, the greater the thief.\" Again, Poggio Bracciolini, who was another Papal emissary, writing at about the same period tells us : \u2014 \" Every man in Germany who lives on his own property, in some burg or village remote from the towns, is called a ' noble.' Of this class, a great number are addicted to open plunder.'' Moreover, Dunham, in his \" History of the German Empire,\" in- forms us that \" the medi\u00e6val nobles termed that chivalry which the common people called robbery. To live as knights meant neither more nor less than to live by rapine. In the estimation of the nobles, simple theft was, assuredly, odious,\" he adds ; \"but it was so only because the property was taken in a cowardly man- ner.\" In very early times, however, the old Teutonic tribes are said to have been a free and honest people, living in the woods, and ruled by no hereditary despot. Some historians speak of them as consisting of as many different republics as there were separate tribes, and having no one chief to govern the whole, ex- cept iu the time of war. In those days, the Dux, or Princeps (the Herzhog or Fiirst, as the Germans called him), was elected or chosen by the united freemen, who were the only persons in the State that took rank as Homines ; for all engaged in any branch of industry or commerce were classed as res, non persona. (things, not persons), who, in legal language, had no peculium, being regarded merely as beasts of burden \u2014 for they could possess no property whatever apart from their lords. Indeed, they were"], [31, "\" THE BEGGAR BARONS.\" 15 bought and sold with the land like cattle, and are even spoken of as having been yoked. \" Let every man know his own team of men, horses, and oxen,\" says an ancient MS. In wills, too, they were bequeathed, as a man now disposes of his plate and money. Such was the state of the great body of the Saxon people previous to the Carlovingian era, that two-thirds at least, or, according to some, three-fourths, of the entire community were merely the goods and chattels of their masters. True, the principal affairs of the country were regulated by Plaids (Placita regni), or, in other words, by half-yearly Parliaments or Diets, in which the higher nobles only had the right of voting ; the lower ones, and such freemen as were entitled to bear arms, being per- mitted to attend there to applaud the decisions of the others. The nobles themselves, we are told, were far too haughty to do other than hunt and make war. They scorned all industrial occupations \u2014 arts as well as commerce \u2014 and looked upon any kind of labour as fit only for beasts. They dwelt in fortified places, buried in vast forests, v.ith a host of slaves and warriors about them, ready to pounce down upon and plunder any travel- ling merchant who might cross their territories, on the way to some distant fair. So proud, too, were they of having been free- born, that any of their class marrying with villeins or hinds were themselves doomed to perpetual bondage. In the reign of Louis le Debonnaire (a.d. 814-840), however, the election of the Dukes began to be discontinued. Originally, the chief dignities throughout the German nation were, as we have said, elective, and titles were inseparable from jurisdiction of some kind or other ; and though the choice generally fell upon the heir or next of kin after the decease of any of the dignitaries, till the offices had all the appearance of being hereditary, each territorial ruler, nevertheless, had only a life interest in the fief. But in the ninth century the power of the Dukes had so increased that they were able to declare their titles to be perpetual ; where- upon even the petty princes began to assume the authority of monarchs \u2014 coining money, having exchequers of then- own, swords of state being carried before them, and living in pretentious royal pomp. Hence, instead of their offices and estates lapsing, as formerly, to the nation on the death of the previous possessor, it came to pass that every Duke's eldest son got to inherit, as a right, the title and lands of his father ; while his second son be came a nominal count, and the others nominal barons. But, in the course of years, so obnoxious had it grown to the beggarly"], [32, "16 ni.RMAX LIFE AND MANNERS. pride of the petty German Dukes, and other self-styled nobles, to hand down to posterity any being less titularly-grand than them selves, that they ordained, in the fourteenth century, that, while their estate should become the inheritance of the eldest son alone, all the co-heirs should alike be at liberty to assume the title of the family ; and thus every one of the sons of a duke, with the exception of the first-born, came to be nominal dukes, without any estates whatever (instead of mere counts and barons, as in the ninth century) ; whilst the younger male children of every count in the country got to be nominal counts, and those of barons nominal barons in the same manner, without even an acre or a \" dog-hole \" to maintain their fancied dignity.* Accordingly, in a few years afterwards, the nation got to swarm with the beggarly lack-land sons of dukes, counts, and barons, as thick as rats in a barn, and who, though they bore the name of knights, were merely a horde of armed vagrants, or titled brigands, that no sooner had received the \" baldric \" than, in the words of Peter of Blois, \"they began to turn their weapons against those whom thev had sworn to protect, to pillage and lay waste the substance of the poor, tO plunder the domains of the Church, to rob the merchants, and * This is the name of the subterranean dungeons with which every Ger- man i oble's castle was fitted in the olden time, and into which the wretched merchants whom they had seized and plundered were thrown, and allowed t'> remain, until such time as an exorbitant ransom was paid for their liberty. T >ie rums of the robber-castles on the Rhine and in other parts of Germany fchow how prevalent was the custom of entombing all the prisoners who be- -ubjeet to the tender mercies of these baronial or ducal highwavmen. At Rheinfels there are no less than seven such dog-hole dungeons at the bottom of deep shafts dug in the rock ; while at Pfalz \u2014 the little castle that is hardly bigger than a bathing-barge on the Seine at Paris, and built on top of a dumpy rock out in the middle of the Rhine \u2014 there is a dungeon sunk deep under the bed of the river, into the mouth of which the guides are wont to throw a lighted piece of paper, so that the visitors, aa the flame descends, may have some sense of the depth of the damp and dark well into which the wretched merchants were in the habit of being lowered. At the old ducal castle at Baden-Baden, again, one sees the same atrocious palace fittings ; and history tells us that the dukes of this country were wont to bring forth such prisoners as they had made in their predatory txcursians and to command them to kiss the Virgin (baiser la Tlerae) as a proof of the truth of what they had spoken ; and imniediatelv the poor creatures approached the wooden image, with the view of embracing it the platform under their feet gave way, and their bodies were precipitate'd to the bottom of the well beneath, to be torn to pieces bv the \" devil \" or wlieel set with knives, that was kept for ever turning there by a stream at the base of the rock."], [33, "' THE BEGGAR BARONS. 17 mercilessly torment the unfortunate ;\" until, as a modern histo rian tells us, \" it came to pass that a German knight was but another name for bandit, and a count or duke for that of the chief of the bandits ; while chivalry and nobility were, in Germany, at least, but cloaks for robbery and oppression.\" This state of things continued till the towns leagued together to protect themselves against the incursions of the brigand aris tocracy ; and at the end of the thirteenth century the system of pillage by the robber and beggar barons had risen to such a height that the Emperor Rudolph of Hapsburg razed, as we have said, in one year no less than seventy of the Raub-schlosser (robber palaces), and condemned to death several score of the noble high waymen. It can hardly be said that the same state of things prevails in Germany at the present day. The open plunder and outrages of the nobles have, of course, in this age of police, utterly ceased. Nevertheless, the petty princes, and paltry kingly dukes, who have not half the possessions, nor a tithe of the refinement, of a wealthy English commoner, persist in styling themselves Serenis simi, and \" kingly highnesses,\" and in coining their own money, till the country is flooded with plated groschens and kreutzers, and greasy paper thalers, that no peasant even will look at two miles away from their own territories \u2014 in having each a Lord Cham berlain, to whom they pay hardly the wages of an English coach man, and who, consequently, has the manners of an Irish clod hopper \u2014 in maintaining an army of plough-boys, who are obliged to spread themselves out at parade, like the supernumeraries at a cheap theatre, so as to appear anything more formidable than the \" awkward squad \" commanded by the Hauptman von Bombastes Furioso ; and who have merely such a diet of black bread and soup doled out to them as would create a rebellion in an English workhouse. The number of \" placemen\" in Germany it is difficult to esti mate. The people themselves have a proverb that it is impossible to spit in the street without hitting some official. We took the trouble to go through the address-book of the Thuringian capital, in order to find out how many of the citizens were dependent upon their own industry, rather than to the petty Government of their country, for their living ; for on high-days and holidays, and at every fair or feast-time, when the streets are crowded, tbe thoroughfares are motley with the different colours of the uniforms 2"], [34, "18 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. worn by the national placemen ; and we found that one in every ten of the grown males in Eisenach derived his income from the State, rather than from any manual or commercial occupation. There are in Eisenach, so far as we can make out (and the calcu lation was entered into in concert with an intelligent citizen, so as to prevent any errors on our own part) some 300 aud odd placemen and pensioners \u2014 and that in a town numbering only between 13,000 and 14,000 men, women, and children. Since, therefore, one-half of the entire population must consist of females, and one-half of the remainder, again, of males who are either too old or too young to be engaged in any active service, we have a total of 3,000 and odd able-bodied men, capable of earning their own living ; and as the Eisenach address-book shows that no less than 300 and odd of these are engaged in Government offices, it follows that the proportion of self-supporting citizens to placemen is as above-stated. A few, indeed, of the most striving \" clear out\" year after year to America, while those who remain behind pester every English man and every foreigner with their solicitations to get them situations away from their home. \" Here,\" they will tell you, \" there is no hope for us ; black-bread and potato-soup is all we can expect for the rest of our lives.\" And when they are advised to seek another lot in another land, where energy and enterprise are the characteristics of the country, and where honesty and industry are sure to meet with a liberal reward, they will tell you very frankly that they do not believe in such things, and that nothing is to be done in the world but by favour and interest, by place-hunting and tinie-serving, and, indeed, by the use of every faculty that honest aud honourable Englishmen have loug leamt to despise. Nor is this the only evil arising from the prevalence of universal counts and barons in Germany; for every petty tradesman, directly he acquires money enough to enable him to rank with the lord of some httle village, has to be ennobled like wise. The feudal customs and privileges in connection with the baronial class continued even down to the year 1848. Until the year of the revolutions, when every German potentate was ready to swear anything and everything the people wished of him, and to break the oath in the coolest possible manner as soon as the nine days' fury for national freedom had passed away, all the lords of the soil who ruled over the mud villages in their neighbourhood had power to force the peasants to work for them at certain times"], [35, "\" THE BEGGAR BARONS. 19 of the year. At one season the Baiters were compelled to go out in the woods and cut and carry timber for their lord ; at others they had to collect the dried leaves from the forest, and to stack them for the use of his lordship's cattle during the winter ; at others, again, their wives and children had to wend their way to the fields and clear the stones from the baron's land, or else to help to make the hay or get in the harvest. At such times the law empowered the village baron or count, as the case might be, to force every one in the hamlet \u2014 men, women, and children \u2014 to do his work for him without the least fee or reward, and those who refused he had the right of imprisoning in the Frohnen-feste (literally, the drudgery-cell), for some two, three, or more days, according to the nature of the offence. This Frohnen-feste in Eisenach was situate iu the old Roman gate called Nicolai Thurm, and in other parts of the country it consisted of a dungeon or dog-hole attached to the baron's mud-hovel of a castle. In the olden time the feudal lords of Thuringia were in the habit of sending an overseer with the gangs of villagers who had to do the barons' work, and the vassal stood by the others with a whip in his hand, after the fashion of the modern slave-drivers in America, to lash the lazy or unwilling among the men, women, or children into extra exertion. Moreover, in the time of Ludwig the Iron, who was one of the landgraves in the 12th century, it was the fashion to yoke the peasants, like oxen, to the barons' ploughs. The romantic incident which led to the abolition of this barbarous practice now forms the subject of one of the Thuringian legends, and will be found narrated hereafter. In '48, however, such feudal privileges were, luckily swept away. In some places the village community gave a round sum to get rid of the lord's right of \" soccage\" for ever ; in others, the compensation consisted of a yearly gift of corn, fowls, or eggs from the different houses ; and it will be seen hereafter, when we come to speak of the taxes paid by the people of Eisenach, that many now have to pay a certain sum annually in lieu of the \" cock and hen\" tax imposed upon their dwellings. The majority of even the well-to-do German nobles are merely small country farmers, who would hardly be allowed to rank as yeomen in England ; and, assuredly, the houses in which they live, though they go hy the name of \"palaces\" or \"castles \" in the country, are such as no English farmer with even 100 acres to cultivate would consent to pig in. A Saxon village, indeed, even with the Saxon lord's wattle-and-dab tumble-down mansion at the"], [36, "20 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. end of it, is such a picture of the most abject dirt, misery, and squalor as no Englishman can possibly conceive ; and even though we were at the trouble to pay a special visit to the farms kept by the richest noblemen in the vicinity of Eisenach \u2014 such as those of Mittelshof and Nuenhof, the proprietors of which both ranked as thaler-millionaires in the country \u2014 we found them in such a state of filth, untidiness, and discomfort as could not possibly exist even in the poorest villages of England. At Nuenhof, indeed, the cows were all suffering from disease ; and no wonder, for the shed in which some three-score of the poor beasts were stalled was utterly deficient in ventilation, and the floor damp with the animals' excreta that must have been left there for day's together. The barons' dwellings, again, were utterly wanting in all those signs of neatness, cleanliness, and comfort which are the characteristics of an English homestead \u2014 and, indeed, such bare boarded, half-furnished places as make an English gentleman shudder to contemplate. Nor did the feudal customs of Thuringia prevail only among the lords of the soil. The trades' corporations, or Zunfts, as they were called, were equally despotic in their privileges, and these continued even down to the end of the year 1862 ; up to which time every apprentice who did not take off his cap to a master or journeyman in the street was subjected to a sound box on the ears, and had his Mtitze torn from his head and dashed to the ground. Nor could an apprentice smoke a pipe, or even dance at a ball, until he had served his time. Then a feast was held, and the quondam Lehrjunge was formally admitted to the rights of a journeyman. A certain piece of work, known as the Gesell-stuck (i. e. journeyman's piece), had to be executed, and in some cases brought in to the assembled masters and men upon a new German silver plate ; and when the work had been pronounced satisfactory, a long pipe, decorated with ribbons, was presented to the new Gesell, and he was permitted to smoke for the first time. After this a glass of beer was placed at his side, when he was expected to knock with his knuckles on the table before drinking, and to say, \"Mit Gunst, Meistern und Gesellen\" (With your leave, masters and journeymen). Then the corporation-box was opened in his presence, and the silver drinking-cup and trade papers taken out -with great ceremony, the united company standing up the while, all with their hats on (for caps are not allowed to be worn on such occasions), each with a walking-stick in his hand, and with only three buttons of his coat fastened ; for if any had"], [37, "\" THE BEGGAR BARONS. 21 appeared with his coat buttoned in two or or four places, he would have been fined or reprimanded as being unacquainted with the Handwerks-gebrauche (trade usages). Nor, until the end of last year, could any workman set up for himself in any trade until he had executed some appointed Meister-stiick. For this purpose he had to be locked up in a room by himself for three days at the house of the master of the guild, where he was expected to treat the journeymen, and the master himself, most liberally with cigars. sausage, and beer all the while \u2014 else there was no hope of the work being passed ; whilst, on the other hand, let him be as sorry a workman as he might, if he only gave plenty to eat, drink, and smoke, the others were sure to help him through with his labour."], [38, "CHAPTER III. THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. Before introducing the reader to the amenities of the middle class of life in the Residenz Stadt, or palatial town of Eisenach, let us give him some sense of the extent, the character, and the appearance of the Thuringian capital itself. In its length and breadth Eisenach is about of the same dimensions as the little suburban hamlet of Hampstead with us. It consists of hardly more than two long straggling principal streets \u2014 the one at right angles to the other ; the first stretching to the full length of the \" back-slum \"-hke string of buildings, and the second extending along the extreme breadth of the town. The style of dwellings is very much similar to those of the tumble down tenements which constitute the Jews' Quarter in Frankfort \u2014 indeed, the principal thoroughfare, the Rue de Rivoli, or Regent Street, of Eisenach was formerly the Jews' Alley ; and, if the reader is acquainted with the character of the Hebrew districts of large crowded capitals, such as our Duke's Place or Holywell Street, where the old clothes'-men and marine store-dealers delight to congregate, he may form some faint conception of the elegance not only of the Eisenach shops, but of the Eisenach architecture in the principal quarter of the city. An English friend who paid us a visit here, told us, on our taking him his first walk through the town, that it gave him a notion that he was con tinually parading down a series of London mews, and that he was always wondering when he was to come to the front of the houses and the streets themselves. An English lady, on the other hand, who had been residing in the place for some twelve months previous to our taking up our quarters in it, informed us that we should find it was merely one large farmyard, made up of so many Irish cottier-like habitations. Indeed, if we wrote our pen to a stump"], [39, "THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. 23 we could not better the description of that same quick-witted and kindly English gentlewoman : for as you walk down the main thoroughfares in the autumn, the flail is always heard beating away like the pendulum to a big church clock, and the streets for ever resound with the squealing of fettered pigs driven through the highways. One of the first sounds that salute the ears in the morning is the \" ranz des vdches,\" as the herdsman collects the cows and goats that are kept in the yards at the back of almost all the dwellings ; even as the last noise in the evening is sure to be the cracking of the cowherd's heavy whip, as he brings the kine home again to the city, and the creatures go scampering off to their stalls through the street-doors and down the passages of the houses of the innkeepers and bakers, the petty tradesmen, and even the lawyers and doctors, themselves; whilst at the fall of the year, when the fields have to be strewn with manure for the next twelve month's crop, the dung-heaps at the back of each house are emptied and thrown out into the middle of the principal thorough fares \u2014 the furrier, the tinman, the bookseller, the milliner, the goldsmith, the grocer, the watchmaker, being one and all more intent upon looking after their muck-heaps than either the litera ture, the fashions, or the jewellery which the astute stranger might fancy to constitute their principal business. At that season of the year, indeed, the highways reek to nausea with the stench of the filth that lies littered in front of every door, till the sleepy ox waggons have time to can-y it off in vehicles, which are hardly more capacious than a navigator's wheel-harrow ; so that the lady pedestrian has to pick her way through it, day after day, with her dress in one hand, and her pocket-handkerchief in the other. Such, too, is the mania for pig-keeping in Eisenach, that we verily believe there was not a hovel in the town that had not its couple of coarse, wild-looking Hungarian porkers styed up in dark boxes no bigger than a sea-chest, and with no more light or air than the Black Hole at Calcutta. Not a master-cabinet-maker but had his pair of hogs stowed among his timber-sheds at the rear of his meubles magasin. The watchmaker, who not only himself repaired the dials of the citizens, but whose wife made the bonnets and head-dresses for their fraus and daughters \u2014 even he could find it either profitable or pleasant to neglect his double business for the feeding of pigs and growing of his own sausages. The palace-glazier, the palace silversmith, the palace-bootmaker \u2014 \u25a0 in a word, the palace-everything, even down to the palace-chimney sweep\u2014all had a pig-stye at their back-doors ; and, so far as we"], [40, "24 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. know, the professors, the parsons, the advocates, and even the Lord Chamberlain himself, thought pig-rearing and pig killing more attractive than either learning, religion, law, or the fascina- tions of courts. For we verily believe there was but one man in this same town of Eisenach who did not throw his whole soul out of his business, and into \" swineflesh \" \u2014 and he was the palace- linendraper and money-changer; but then it should be added thathe was an Israelite also, so that it was merely the religious prejudices of the worthy which prevented him from taking part in the na- tional pastime. As we sit at our window writing, another sharp squeal under our casement tells us that a tethered pig is being driven down the most fashionable street of the town\u2014 for our bow- window looks up the entire length of the little thoroughfare. And now mark, as the driver lashes the animal with his whip, and one's ears are split with the sharp squeaks, that sound as shrill as if there was a knife-grinder at work below, how all the principal boor-citizeDs come streaming out of their shops, the tanneries, and the taverns, to have a look and a pinch at the back of the lusty-lunged hog. See ! there is tanner-master Fiessinger, without any hat, and in his felt slippers, standing and talking to the peasant owner of the animal. We can almost hear him say, \" Hallo ! cousin, where is he from ? \" and before the big-caped driver has time to reply, the \"thick Pabst,\" as the corpulent chandler's shop-keeper facing our window is called, makes his appearance in an embroidered fez-cap, a pair of Berlin worked slippers, and without any cravat about his neck ; and then as he stands at his little shop door, wrapping up a cornichon of dried apple-chips, he, too. shouts to the driver, \"What costs such acue?\" Now we catch sight of the bald head of the \" palace-privileged apothecary,\" whose dis- pensary stands at the opposite corner of the street (for he, too, must run out from serving some of the neighbouring villagers) ; and as he proceeds to arrange the long label about the neck of the bottle of cough mixture he holds in his hand, he cries, \" Good day, cousin, how heavy is such a porker?\" Next comes the watchmaker, who has started up from his seat at his shop-window, where he generally sits cleaning the works of some old time-piece ; and he rushes out habited in a long greasy dressing-gown and slippers, to know how the old creature is. Facing this one lives the Herr Advocat Selzer, who, hearing the well known cry, has hurried down from his papers to take part in the examination aud inquiries as to the condition and price of the animal ; and he, too,"], [41, "THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. 25 is still in his dressing-gown and night-shirt, with his wig un brushed and all awry, although it be but within an hour of the mid-day meal. Nor is he there for a minute ere the Catholic \" baker master \" Martin, over the way, thrusts his floury head out of the little practicable window-pane behiud the tray of cater pillar-like rolls arranged outside the house ; and he says to the others, as he eyes the animal round about which they are grouped, \" Fine sausages there, neighbour ! \" and then sliding back the pane, comes straightway into the street, to have a piuch at the haunches of the animal like the rest. After this, the so-called crazy Schrumpf, the man-milliner, a door or two above, darts into the middle of the crowd, crying, \" Ach wass ! ach wass! ach wass ! my pig is twice the size of that, and I've only had him fattening these last three weeks. Why, that won't be fit to kill till Easter !\" \u2014 and so saying, he huddles his long dressing-gown tightly round his legs to hide the flannel drawers in which he has made his appearance in the middle of the road. Whereupon a noisy dis cussion ensues among the worthy citizens out in the centre of the thoroughfare, as to whether that be the proper sort of \" land swine,\" and whether it will fatten with little food or not, and as to how many \" Centners \" it weighs ; till heads are thrust from almost every one of the upper windows, and figures of tradesmen appear on the door step of every shop, all in long dirty dressing gowns, and with almost as long dirty pipes, to take part in the porcine controversy ; one standing out for so many pounds, and another crying, \" What will you bet ?\" or, \" It isn't true !\" or \"You're a liar !\" after the accustomed amenities of the place. You have, indeed, but to listen to the boorish wrangles, to watch the graphic gestures, and notice the elegantand industrious morning costumes of the tradesmen and the hand-workers, to know without going over your door step what they are all saying and doing in the middle of the most fashionable street of Eisenach, at an hour which should be the busiest time of the day. The master-weaver's loom, which we can see from our window, from moming to night. flitting backwards and forwards, suddenly stops working; the neighbouring smith's hammer ceases beating ; the haberdasher comes out with the lace edging that he was about to show to some customer dangling in his hand ; the silversmith sallies forth rubbin\" away at some spoon that he was busy polishing ; the hel meted policemen stops on his rounds ; the barber halts, with the little leathern box in which he carries his razors, soap, and water, under his arm ; and indeed every one discontinues working, and"], [42, "26 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. even the most hastily-pressed loiters on his way \u2014 immediately a pig to sell makes its appearance in the streets of the principal Residenz Stadt of Thuringia. But we have before said the Thuringian capital is merely a large farmyard, in which agrarian pursuits prevail to a far greater extent than the ordinary occupations of civic life. The reader has already seen how, in the village of Mohra, the chief magistrate is merely the principal boor of the hamlet ; how justice there alternates with threshing and chaff-cutting; and- how the execu tive government of the little place (the forestanding men of the community, the two watchmen and one policeman) are far more intent upon looking after their pigs and cattle than in guarding and protecting their neighbours. In Eisenach the same jumble of civic duties and agricultural pursuits holds good, though to a less caricature degree. The mayor of the Thuringian capital, cer tainly, delights in pig-feeding, and loves to grow his own sausages like the Eisenachers in general ; but he can hardly be said to throw his whole soul into the pig-stye \u2014 like the Mohra Schulze. The judge of the assize court, too, though he can scarcely, in fairness, be spoken of as a thorough boor, revels between the in tervals of his judicial duties (like Cincinnatus of old) in the rich ness of his manure, rather than the subtleties of jurisprudence ; and is prone, when he lays aside the sword of justice, to wield the cabbage-slicer instead, for the due preparation of his winter stock of Sauer kraut. Nor is there hardly one pure and unmixed civic occupation pursued in the town ; for the majority of the master-tradesmen are petty peasant-proprietors as well. The master-shoemakers almost all keep cows in the back yards of their houses. Some of the cabinet-makers have from twelve to fourteen acres of land in the suburbs, and are more taken with ploughing their fields than planing their deals. Many of the bakers are wont to raise the rye they use in the manufacture of their black bread. The Saddler-and-upholsterer keeps a couple of sheep in the wood-house in his \" Hof\" and loves to grow the wool which he uses to stuff the chairs and sofas of the citizens. Even the confectioner lays his own eggs, through the intervention of a dozen or two Cochin-Chinas at the back of his shop. The fur rier, too, is the principal game-purveyor and sportsman of the place, for the mere sake of the hareskins and roebuck-hides that he requires in his trade. The one wealthy distiller in the town has a dairy in connection with his business, besides acres in the"], [43, "THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. 27 suburbs, where he grows the potatoes out of which lie manufac tures his Corn-brandy-wine, and his \" finste Arrac de Goa,\" or \" echte Jamaica Rum \" Moreover, the so-called merchants, who have small \"cider-rooms \" attached to their little chandlers '-shops, are in the habit of owning \" garden-houses,\" as they are styled, for the growth of the apples which they turn into vinegar or apple-wine \u2014 according to the demands of their customers \u2014 for there is really no distinguishing the one fluid from the other. Then the clod-hopping apothecaries give their mind to the con genial occupation of fattening geese, and prefer to rear their own feather beds to dispensing farthings '-worth of hair oil to the servant-maids of the town, and palming off on the peasants a halfpenny-worth of dead-dogs' fat, as an infallible cure for those in a galloping consumption. The quantity of potatoes consumed by the people of Eisenach is really incredible, and hence the reason for the universal manure storing throughout the city. Half an acre of potato land yields upon the average from 36 to 40 sacks of 100 and odd pounds each, or between 3600 and 4000 pounds' weight, and this is what each Eisenach family requires every year for the consumption of their pigs and themselves. In fact, many of the modern Saxons know no other food \u2014 living even harder than the poorest Irish do in our country ; the members of the family eating no less than 2000 lbs. weight of potatoes in the course of the year, which is at the rate of more than 5 lbs. a day. Nor should the reader imagine that such a habit prevails only in the poorer portion of the community ; for, as a rule, potatoes and salt constitute the supper every evening of almost every well-to-do-family ; while on the week days potato-dumplings, with fresh or dried fruit, or potato-soup with the smallest scrap of fat pork in it, or potato salad, with a raw pickled herring, are the principal delicacies served at the tables of the gentry. At certain seasons, no work but that of a pastoral character goes on. The principal milliners, for instance, gave up bonnet making in the autumn, and retired from the Magasin to the wash-house to superintend the boihng down of some three hun dred pounds' weight of plums ; and there they remained for twelve hours, stirring away one after the other, until the fruit was reduced to a thick pulp (not unlike liquid papier mdchSJ ; after which it had to be potted away for use in the winter, instead of butter on the bread. Such a concoction is known by the name of zwetschgen Muss (literally plum pap or squash), and strongly"], [44, "28 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. resembles paste-blacking in appearance, while in taste it is about as agreeable as the sickly medicinal compound known as \" elec tuary\" in our apothecaries' shops. A little later in the year, you will find every trades-person in the town neglecting his ordinary business for the preparation of the year's supply of Sauer-kraut; and then, go where you will \u2014 to the tax-collector's, the Steuer Revisor's, to your lawyer, your doctor, your tailor, your boot maker, or your banker \u2014 you will find that they are away at the market, buying their 120 (zwei Schock) or 240 (vier Schock) of immense white-heart summer cabbages for the manufacture of the national dish. Then for a day or two afterwards the entire household will be engaged in slicing down the vegetative cannon balls by means of an instrument like a carpenter's plane ; or else in salting the shreds in enormous pickling-tubs, or rather small vats, the united family being severally engaged in thumping and pressing the mess into a compact mass ; after which a heavy stone is placed on top of it, and there it is left to ferment into pu tridity till the end of the year, when the taste is pronounced to be extremely delicate. In fine, such is the farmyard mania among the tradesmen of the Thuringian capital, that even the \" palace confectioner\" keeps a dozen or so of turkeys about the mixen at the back of his shop, aud keeps the noisy gobbling birds, too, more for pleasure than profit ; for when we wanted one of them for our Christmas dinner, no money would induce him to part with one of his Trut-hiihner, for he told us that such birds were regarded as a curiosity in Saxony. The propensity for pig-keeping, however, is somewhat more rational, seeing that each German family, in the course of the year, consumes on an average from 250 to 400 pouuds' weight of sausages (either in the form of liver ditto, red ditto, hard ditto, or Savoyard ditto, as the case may be) ; and to produce this amount of food, two pigs, at least, are required to be kept, so that commerce and handicraft have to be alike sacrificed to the tending of swine, and the shop neglected for the stye ; while the rear of every dwelling-house, hotel, and government office is converted into an open stagnant sewer, where the refuse of the people, and their kindred pigs, is allowed to rot and reek for the sake of the equally essential potatoes that, as we have said, are consumed by every Saxon family by the ton weight per annum ! Auother peculiarity of the Saxon citizens is their love of what are called \" garden-houses.\" This they have in common with the people of Holland, where it is usual to see a corpulent gentleman"], [45, "29 THE CITIZEN LIFE OF EISENACH. smoking his pipe in a sentry-box beside some foetid and duck weedy ditch in the outskirts of the town, and with an ostentatious placard stuck up in the few square yards of the garden-grounds, saying, \" my only happiness on earth is here.\" In the same manner all round about Eisenach, there are little buildings hardly bigger than sedan-chairs, with a patch of garden land in front of them, about the size of a Turkey carpet ; and thither the towns folk delight to wend their way, in the broiling summer's evenings, laden with coffee-cups and cake, so that they may smoke their pipe and drink their infusion of burnt carrots out in the country. Boasting Germans tell you that their countrymen are distinguished from all other races by their Natur-sinn (sense of nature), but, so far as we could judge, this Natur-sinn seemed to lie merely in a love of \" green stuff,\" for they were in the habit of going into ecstasies at the sight of the least verdure, exclaiming, on every occasion, \" Wunder-schbne Griine ! Liebe Gott, das ist pracht voll .\"' though they were as insensible as frogs to the quieter and tenderer graces of the earth \u2014 the beauties of hght and shade, the harmony of colour, or the symmetrical arrangement of form. So much so, indeed, that we used often to wonder why, if mere verdure was so pleasant to them, a dish of salad or water-cresses should not throw them into like raptures ; and how it was, if their nation was so remarkable for this same Natur-sinn, the poetry of their country should be so utterly deficient in every picturesque quality, and marked by none of that exquisite percep tion of the daintier beauties of external nature which is to be found in the writings of our own Wordsworth, Tennyson, Keats, and Shakespeare."], [46, "CHAPTER IV. OF THE ELEGANCIES OF LIFE IN SAXONY, The usual matutinal costume of the young ladies at home, con sists of nothing but a petticoat, an old coloured chintz sleeping jacket, without even stays or bodice beneath it, and a close-fitting calico nightcap, about as elegant in shape and look as that of a sick boy in a parish infirmary with us ; while over their neck is spread any old duster-like rag with which they can cover their shoulders ; their feet being thrust into such a pair of burst-out slip-shod shoes, as no decent person in our own country would pick up in the street. Nor must the reader imagine that the above picture of German ladies in their morning attire is in the least over-coloured ; or that we paint this universal portrait of the Saxon baronesses and gentlewomen, the young as well as old, a3 they are to be found at home in the morning \u2014 up to noon-day and even later \u2014 from the outward appearance of any one eccentric individual. On the contrary, we speak merely of what is the general custom, even with ladies of title, the wives of judges, aud the female members of the families of government officers, and those of the professional gentry. Indeed, a German woman, no matter what her station, regards any old thing she can lay her hands on as fit to wear in the house ; and believes that gowns and bodices, not to speak of clean cuffs and collars, are articles utterly superfluous for her to put on, in the presence of her husband and children ! Nor can it be said that the harsh lines of this sketch are due to national prejudice ; for it was only some twelve months or so back that there appeared a letter in one of the principal Berlin papers, written by a German, upbraiding his country women for the shameless and dirty state of their persons in their own houses in the early part of the day ; and concluding by con trasting the filthy state of the entire household of a morning in"], [47, "elegancies of life in saxont. 31 an ordinary Teutonic family, with that of the neat and decent appearance of every member of any respectable Englishman's house, when sitting down to their comfortable morning meal. Indeed, breakfast, as an Englishman knows it, with a snowy damask-cloth to cover the solid mahogany table, the bright silver urn steaming away over the equally bright silver tea-pot. milk jug and sugar basin \u2014 the simple china cups arranged at one end of the table where the mistress of the house is to preside \u2014 the plates, aud knives and forks, all tidily set round the other parts of the board \u2014 the silver egg-stand and toast-rack, with the dish of broiled ham, or kidneys, or cold chicken, as the case may be, set out in the centre alongside of the glass butter-dish and the crisp crusty cottage-loaf of white bread on its carved platter, the wood of which is as white as new Tunbridge ware \u2014 such a sight as this, in the clean, snugly carpeted, solidly-furnished, cosy parlour, is assuredly never to be observed in any other land than our own. Where else, too, is to be seen the like of the decent English housewife, as spruce and tidy, and as carefully dressed for break- fast, no matter how early the hour, as if she were attired for the grandest party of friends in the evening ? for, though she wears her morning-gown instead of her evening one, it differs from her best merely in the material, and is a shade less fashionable in its make ; while her hair is as smooth as satin, and as well arranged as you would find it later in the day. With so bright an example, too, is it likely that the daughters and the sons of such a family would venture to appear at the meal in a less trim or orderly condition ? while even the waiting-maid herself, who has had to sweep and dust the room before breakfast, has to conform to the general cleanliness ; and is never allowed to enter the parlour unless she has tidied herself after the work, and made herself fit to come into an assembly where nothing but comfort, order, and decency are expected to prevail. Such a meal, such a sight, it must require a hundred years of \" progress \" before the boorish Saxons can ever be made to under stand the social enjoyment of. Think, now, of a German break fast in Saxony, by way of contrast. The picture we have given of the English repast is that which prevails, not among the titled and wealthier classes, but among the well-to-do members of British middle life. Nor is the sketch that of an unusual feast, but such as occurs every morning in every well-regulated homestead. Well, the usual \" early bit,\" as the first meal is significantly called in Germany, consists, among ordinary middle-class folk, of a tin tray"], [48, "32 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of white breadlets placed in the centre of the table, which is utterly destitute of cloth, and has merely a few coffee-cups arranged any how at one corner of the board, while the earthen coffee-pot is put to stand on the stove in a corner of the room. Nor is there so much as a knife or plate ; nor, indeed, either a milk-jug or sugar-basin, or even a single chair set to await the coming of tbe several members of the family, who make their appearance almost in the same state as they spring out of bed, on hearing that the coffee is served. In they come, one by one, shuffling across the bare boards of the wretched room, some a quarter of an hour after the others, according as they have felt more or less hungry, or drowsy, as the case may be ; for none is expected to wait for the rest, and each helps himself, or herself, to the contents of the coffee-pot and the bread-tray, just as he or she will. First, comes the grubby old mother, most likely ; about as graceful in appear ance as an Irish basket-woman at the London green-markets, and certainly not looking half as tidy as an English charwoman ; for she has slipped on merely an old dark woollen petticoat and thrown a shawl over her head, and pinned it under her chin. Then, as she stands at one corner of the table, she begins, alone, to partake of the sumptuous fare ; for the \" black coffee,\" as it is called, consists of a decoction of the smallest-possible, cheapest possible, and filthiest-possible Java berries, thickened and black ened with the powder of burnt carrots ; and this wash is drunk neat \u2014 without either milk or sugar, we repeat, to palliate it. Well, the elegant old Fkau von Fish-fag, or the gracious Grafin von Apple-woman, pours out a cup of the \" black broih,\" and, as she stands alone at the table, dips her long caterpillar like breadlet into the mess ; and then after having soaked the roll, till it is as soft and brown as a bit of wet ginger-bread, pro ceeds, in accordance with the most high-and-nobly-born \"fashion\" of Germany, to suck the end of it as a charity-boy does a lolly pop ; and when she has removed all the black moistened pap from the rest of the long breadlet, she goes on to soak the sucked end of the roll as before ; and so continues, soaking and sucking, till the elegant meal is finished ; after which she turns her coffee cup down in her saucer, as a sign that she is \" sat,\" as the ladies here politely phrase it \u2014 and then away \" the gracious Frau von Fish-fag \" shuffles, to tell her daughters once more that the coffee is ready. In a few minutes afterwards, the proud young ladies themselves make their appearance at the sumptuous board, each in a white"], [49, "elegancies of life in saxony. 33 calico night-cap, as we have said, and without either a bodice or gown to cover their bodies. Thus elegantly attired, they proceed, while one rubs her unwashed eyes with her unwashed hands, and the other keeps scratching away at her unbrushed hair uuder her cap, to go through the same refined operation of coffee-drinking, both standing at the table, as their mother had done before them, and jerking away, every now and then, at the one old woollen petticoat enveloping their lower limbs, like the sack of a French journeyman-baker, to keep it from falling at their feet And when the girls have sucked their rolls to the end, the father, maybe, makes his appearance in his dressing-gown and drawers, to go through the same elegant process ; the only one, indeed, of the family who appears dressed for the occasion being the son, and he is washed and tidied \u2014 not because such silly formality is expected of him at home \u2014 but because he has either to go to bis comptoir or to his military duties, or to be at the forest-men's 6chool, as the case may be, at such an early hour. The female fashion of appearing in night-caps till a late hour in the day is not confined merely to ladies at home, but prevails even at the fashionable German baths, where decent women think it by no means unseemly to sit thus slovenly attired, in public, outside the doors of the different hotels they inhabit, and that till within an hour or so of dinner-time. The 10 o'clock meal, which is equivalent to the English lun cheon, or the French dejeuner it la fourchette, has no more cere mony about it, and, indeed, no more refinement in the serving of it, than the \" early bit ;\" since in most houses this meal is not served at all, but each member of the family is left to go to the cupboard and cut off a slice of black bread, as thick as an octavo volume, and to smear it with butter, in the same manner as a bricklayer trowels a dab of mortar over a brick. Then, with the slices in their hands, the ladies shuffle about the house, biting out large semicircular pieces as they sweep or dust the rooms, or pro ceed with the ironing of their skirts for the next grand ball. For the due enjoyment of the 10 o'clock meal, however, it is generally customary for the master of the house to retire to some tavern in the town, either the \" Town-Councillor's Cellar,\" or the \" Rock Cellar,\" or Heaven knows what other beer-cellar it may be (for there is a beer-house to almost every dozen of the popula tion) in order to wash the bit of dry black bread and sausage which he takes with him, down with a glass of beer. And there he will sit, at a table, and in a room, not half so tidy as a public- 3"], [50, "34 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. house parlour, and, indeed, not a whit better than a London tap, with his clasp-knife in one hand and the hunk of black rye-bread in the other, amid the reeking tobacco smoke, eating and gossip ing away, with the master-tradesmen, or lawyers, or doctors, or government clerks, who have all left their business on the same errand, only an hour or so after the commencement of the day's work. Others, on the contrary, retire to the chandlers' shops, where, alone, the Schnapps, delighted in by the more fiery -throated citizens, is allowed to be sold ; and there, calling for a raw red herring or a raw pickled cucumber, they proceed either to strip off the skin of the dried fish with their fingers and eat it raw in their hands, or else to bite off bits of the gigantic gherkin as they hold it, like a green sausage, in their fists, while they sip their glass of carraway corn-brandy-wine, and declare that the \" smack of the feast is truly delicate.\" Among the Eisenach ladies, whenever they have occasion to be away from home at so early an hour as to prevent their taking the 10 o'clock meal at their own house, it is by no means unusual for the sweet creatures to drop in at one of the butchers' shops, and bid the \" Fleischer \" chop up for them a groschen 's worth of raw beef or pork (according to taste) with some raw onions which the damsels bring ready with them ; and, when this has been done, they cram the lump of hacked meat into their pocket \u2014 often without even a piece of paper to cover it ; and, then, having pro vided themselves with a halfpenny roll at the next baker's, proceed, with the meat in one hand, and the bread in the other, to take a bite, first at the chopped flesh and then at the \" Br'odchen ;\" or else, cutting the \" Semmel \" in twain, and spreading the mince of raw pork and onions between the slices, they munch the two together \u2014 laughing at those who shudder at the sight of the brutal meal, and declaring it, with a smack of the lips, to be \"pique fine.\" What may be the origin of this German plu-ase, it is diffi cult to say. There is no such word as pique to be found in the W'orterbuch. The term would seem to be an ignorant corruption of the English big, and hence to signify fine to a greater degree. The Germans have, as a rule, but one mode of receiving friends at their houses, and that is at what are called \" coffee-drinkiugs\" \u2014 entertainments which are usually given at three or four in the afternoon, and to which ladies alone are usually invited. Indeed, so common is the custom of excluding all gentlemen from these assemblies, that an English lady informed us, that when she first went into these societies, she was under the impression that she"], [51, "elegancies of life in saxony. 35 was associating with a company of widows. The absence of the male sex, however, from such assemblies, the stranger, after a few months' residence in the country, ceases to wonder at ; for at the hour at which such parties are usually given, the men are mostly in the taverns drinking their beer and smoking their pipes, and the charms of such enjoyments are, to a true German mind, infi nitely preferable to that of female society ; for when we assure the reader that there was but one German in the whole town of Eisenach \u2014 and he was a hypochondriac \u2014 who did not pass everv night of his life away from his family, and amid the tobacco-fumes of some tavern, or petty club, it will not be difficult to understand how httle domestic enjoyment is known among such a peop'e. Home, indeed, which is one of the most poetic of words in Eng land, is always spoken of by the tavern-loving Teuton under the literal and prosaic title of \" the house\" \u2014 even as the husband always terms his wife his \"woman,\" and the wife, in her turn, denominates her married partner her \" man.\" Now, as these Eaffee-oder-Thee-geselhchaften (literally \" coffee or tea companies\") are peculiar to the country which forms the subject of the present book, we will append a description of the entertainment usual on such occasions, taken from one of the best German authorities on the subject. The lady (Henrietta Davidis) from whom we quote, after telling us, in the description she gives as to the forms to be observed at different parties, how all-important it is that at wedding feasts aud \" great tables\" (grossen Tafeln) a change of plates and knives aud forks should accompany each fresh dish, says \u2014 \" Bei jedem Gericht werden die Teller und bei feinen Essen .\u25a0uich jedes Mai Gabeln und Messer gewechselt;\" \u2014 thus implying that upon ordinary occasions such luxuries are by no means necessary ; and that only at \" fine eatings\" it is essential to pay attention to such fastidious formalities ; after which she proceeds to give us an account of the ceremonies requi site to be observed in connection with the \" tea and coffee drink ings\" of the country, e. g. : \u2014 \" The ladies are to be arranged round a table,\" she says, \" over which a napkin (serviette) is to be spread. But when the com pany is numerous, then the younger ladies are to be put into an adjoining room with the door open, and the elder ones seated on a sofa. The tea or coffee is to be made in a side chamber, and when right hot (recht heiss) served to the ladies upon a tray with"], [52, "36 GERMAN LIFE AUD MANNERS. milk, sugar, and a decanter of red wine, or liqueur-bottle full of rum or arrac\" ! ! ! \u2014 the latter being the German equivalent of the English gin. Then, what the Germans call \" bakework,\" that is to say, biscuits and cakes of various kinds, together with thin slices of black bread-and-butter, are to be handed round in httle baskets (Eorbchen) to the company. The cups are not to be taken round one at a time, nor too soon after the assembling of the company, we are told, but are to be placed together on a tea tray, and carried to each of the ladies ; and when they have all finished, the cups are to be collected and rapidly rinsed (gespult) \u2014 so that none of the party may have the misfortune of drinking after the other out of an unwashed vessel ! Then the cups are to be again filled and handed round with the \" bakework\" and black bread-and-butter as before. In the same manner, the cups are to be presented a third time ! and a quarter of an hour after wards the whole is to be cleared away. After this the lady of the house, says the authoress, arranges some entertainment for the company, such as cards (which are generally played for pfennings, or less than a farthing, stakes) for the elder ladies, or forfeits or charades for the younger ones ; and during such games dessert plates and knives (but no forks !) with a slice of fruit tart in each are to be taken round to the party accompanied by some (beliebiges Getrdnk) favourite drink \u2014 raspberry-lemonade, or sugar-water or fruit-syrup being generally given on such occasions. Then a pause of a quarter of an hour is to ensue, after which a small portion of cream \" greis-meal\" (Angl., Embden groats), or starch pudding, or potatoe-meal j elly, is to be sent round on small plates or saucers, each accompanied with a tea-spoon ; with this a sauce is to be served, and a basket of macaroons to follow. The plates or saucers are then to be retained by each lady, and, after a quarter of an hour's pause, a second tart is to be presented, toge ther with slices of pears, apples, or oranges, which have been previously peeled and cut up into a bow] \u2014 the fruit being handed round to the assembly either by the lady of the house, her daughter, or some young lady officiating on the occasion. Finally, another cream, or some sweet \" meal-food\" is to be offered to the ladies before separating \u2014 the same dirty plates and spoons being retained to the end of the entertainment ! ! ! Then the writer favours us with a description of the ceremonies to be observed at \" gentlemen and ladies' teas\" \u2014 \"Herren und Damen Thees\" (though such parties as these, we have said before, seldom occur,"], [53, "ELEGANCIES OF LIFE IN SAXONY. 37 except upon the occasion of christenings or betrothals) \u2014 of which the following is an epitome : \u2014 The ladies, as they arrive, are to be handed to a sofa, or seated in a half-circle round about a small table set in the centre of the room, the gentlemen grouping themselves about the others at pleasure. Then a tray-full of cups of tea, sugar, milk, three kiuds of biscuits, slices of black bread-and-butter with red wine, or the bottles full of neat spirits, as before, is to be handed first to the elderly ladies on the sofa, then to the younger ones, and, last of all, to the gentlemen. After the tray has been carried round three times (as at the ladies' parties), the cups are to be taken away. Then comes a pause, during which the company play at whatever may be agreeable \u2014 cards, or music, according to the taste of the guests. In this interval \"Bischof\" or \" Cardinal\" \u2014 the latter being a peculiar kind of German drink made up of wine flavoured with fruit and sweetened with sugar (and not unlike the messes English children are sometimes in the habit of com pounding in their wine-glasses during dessert) \u2014 is to be offered to the assembly, together with some such fruit tart as the season may afford. Next, small plates or saucers of cold rice-meal pud ding and fruit-juice are to be served, with a tea-spoon, to each person. Later in the evening a second tart, with the aforesaid Bischof (Angl., bishop) or \"Cardinal,\" is to be presented. And, finally, after another pause, pieces of \" marinirter herring\" (de scribed hereafter), or raw ham, bread and cheese, cold meat oi fish, salad, or raw-smoked salmon, or raw sausages, or smoked meat, or raw-herring salad upon bread and butter, or hard-boiled eggs and parsley, or black bread and radishes, are to be offered to the guests as a crowniug relish to the elegant entertainment ! ! ! Such people as have never had the misfortune to be present at one of these refined entertainments cannot possibly have a notion of the amount of trash and mess which German young ladies can manage to stow away on such occasions ; indeed, the capacity of these damsels' stomachs, when eating at another person's expense, always impresses you with the idea of their being utterly underfed at home ; and we have seen the girls nudge one another as the Lord Chamberlain's daughters helped themselves to a fourth or a fifth slice of cake or tart, and heard them whisper, \" Well, you know the poor things have only two portions at dinner among six.\" In a word, every stranger who visits the town tells you that he never, in all his experience, beheld such a gaunt, squalid, underfed race as are the Saxons of the present day ; for you have"], [54, "38 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. but to look in their lantern-jaws to understand that not one in a hundred of them has a bellyful of substantial food in the course of a twelvemonth. Germans delight, in their jealousy, to make sport over the number of beggars that are to be met with in the British dominions ; but we can tell them (and we happen to know some little about the mendicants of London), that an English beggar, living in his \" padding.ken,\" and faring upon the broken victuals which he collects from house to house, is better bedded and better fed than even some of the best German mechanics or gentry\u2014 a matter which the English reader may perhaps understand when we assure him that even the cleverest working cabinet-maker in Eisenach gets for his work but 3.?. a-week, over and above his keep (of the coarsest possible kind) ; and that he is allowed one farthing for his breakfast if directed to take such a meal out of doors. \u2022 In fine, as we have said, you have but to look in the counte nances of these potato-fed and half clad German folk to know what long strides the race has yet to take, in order to keep pace with the rest of civilized Europe ; and yet, like half starved people, they are always eating \u2014 eating trash that yields no satisfaction to the stomach, and which, consequently, sets it craving an hour or two after the miserable, windy food has been crammed into it. At the theatre the curtain has barely fallen upon the first act of the play before the whole of the audience are engaged in munching something or other. Only a night or two ago we were present at the performance of the Fortune-Teller of Geneva, and, before half-an-hour had elapsed, we noticed the daughter of the Judge of the Assizes chewing her bread and sausage, in the most unabashed manner, in the dress-circle ; while the wife of a captain in the infantry was cracking her cold, hard-boiled eggs, and washing them down with a penny glass of beer, as if neither of them had dined heartily for the week past. Indeed, this is the invariable custom of the ladies of Eisenach, as it is with the London cook-maids in the gallery of the Victoria. They one and all have some primitive notion that unless the stomach be kept filled to the gorge it is impossible to sympathize with the dis tresses of the heroine of the drama before them ; and, accordingly, like Miss Kelly, in her celebrated personation of the sentimental scullery-wench, they snivel and they munch as if, without eating, it was impossible for them to squeeze a tear out of their eyes."], [55, "CHAPTER V. A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. The main distinction in the regulation of German and English families is the utter subserviency of the mother to the grown daughters in every Teutonic household. The father of the family seems generally to maintain his supremacy ; unless, indeed, he shares his property among his children before his death (as is often the case in Saxony), binding his children over to pay him a certain yearly sum for his maintenance. This peculiar custom is allowed by law, and in some cases we believe it is found to work well ; but in many others, we have been informed, it gives rise to brutal ill-treatment ou the part of the children to the aged parent ; for the sons get to regard the old man in the light merely of an incubus upon their means, and not only to look forward with anxiety for his death, but to begrudge him almost every mouthful he eats ' Nevertheless, it forms no part of our present purpose to discuss here the working of such an arrangement between aged parents and their grown children ; for now our object is merely to show how every German mother, immediately after the confirmation of her daughters, sinks into nothing better than a serving woman attendant upon them. At that period of life the young ladies, though only just turned fifteen, are considered fit to \" go out \" into society ; and accordingly commence frequenting every public ball, visiting the beer- gardens in the afternoon twice or thrice even- week, and, indeed, joining in every form of amusement peculiar to the ladies of the Thuringian capital. In even the best of German families, it is the rule to keep but one servant, whilst many of the gentlefolks employ only an Aufwdrterin, or charwoman, to come in once or twice during the day, and do the more menial offices of the household. The consequence is, that a considerable"], [56, "40 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. proportion of the hard work of the house is left to the mother to execute ; for she prefers taking such drudgeries upon herself, rather than that the vornehme, or distinguished, young ladies, should soil their skin, or redden their hands by such homely duties. Accordingly, if you happen to call at the house of any of the middle, or even higher class, families in the city, you are almost sure to find the mother in the act of scrubbing the sitting rooms, or else cleaning the saucepans ; and in such a state of rags and dirt that she is utterly indistinguishable from the charwoman whom she is helping in the same occupation ; while the young ladies are engaged in attiring themselves in no end of trumpery finery to be off to the \" Fantasie,\" or the \" Hohe Sonne,\" maybe, to drink their coffee and beer amidst the elite of the town. In most nations, now-a-days, the struggle is how to swell \u00a3200 a-year into the seeming grandeur of \u00a32000. In Germany, how- ever, where all are striving how to make a groschen do duty for a louis d'or, this end is attained merely by the ladies living at home like kitchen wenches and consenting to eat food hardly better than that we give to our pigs and cattle ; while the domestic squalor is cheerfully submitted to, so that the daughters may appear, when away from their homes, dressed in a few showy and staring flimsy robes. Nor is the list of evils attendant upon such a state of society yet ended. If the mother be left to do the greater portion of the housework, while the girls are flaunting abroad, it follows, as a matter of course, that as the father is either supposed to be attending to his professional duties in the evening (or more likely, drinking and gambling in the beer-house), that the daughters must be left to wander about from place to place utterly unpro- tected, and allowed to meet and talk with gentlemen at the beer- gardens, just as they please. Now, in the town of Eisenach, there is a celebrated school, or university, for the training of \" forest-men,\" whose duties in after- life are to consist of the superintendence of the plantation and thinning of the forest lands, from which the German nation still derives by far the greater proportion of its fuel. These students are called \" forest practitioners,\" and generally consist of the sons of petty German barons, or of others, more or less, well-to-do in the nation. They are mostly young men from eighteen to thirty years of age, and there are some sixty or seventy of them alto- gether located in the town during the University terms. These forest-men are the plague of the Eisenach girls' lives, for"], [57, "41 A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. as many of them are nobles, and almost all are of a marriageable age, such young ladies as are over-anxious to procure a partner, whose rank in life may be a shade better than their own, think it, by no means, unfemiuine to faire la cour after the students, and to sit drinking with them in the beer-gardens and the shooting booths till late at night. \" Aye,\" said an Eisenacher to us, \" half the old spinsters in the town are due to those ' Forst-Practikants,' for the fellows come here and circulate stories as to how rich they are, and the girls, silly fools, who believe all they hear, run after them, as though they were mad. The students promise them marriage, of course ; and, when they have finished their studies in the town, go back home, vowing eternal constancy \u2014 and never trouble their heads about the damsels again. The consequence is, that the citizens, when they know that a girl has once been in the habit of con sorting with the forest-men, turn their back upon her, and she is therefore left to trick and entrap some other student ; so that she, at last, comes to be privately betrothed every three years to another gentleman, as fast as fresh relays of young men resort to the college, until she ends by being too old to get a husband at all.\" With this introduction to the different young ladies of Eisenach, we will now conduct the reader to a ball at the \" Klemda \" \u2014 the most fashionable entertainment in the town ; so that he may have an insight into the manners and customs of the gentlefolks there assembled, and thus be able to see how far they differ from our own. Such balls occur at least once a month throughout the entire year \u2014 the expeuses being included in the three-and-sixpenny quarterly subscription. Nor are such expenses heavy, for as everybody has to pay for his own supper \u2014 if he sup at all \u2014 the actual cost of the amusement to the society is limited to the charges of lighting and music ; a few pounds of stearine candles are sufficient for the former, whilst, when we tell the reader that each of the sixteen musicians employed on the occasion receives but twelve groschens (Is. 2d.) ,for playing there from seven in the evening until one, and often two, in the morning, he himself will be able to estimate the outlay necessary for the costly banquet. On the day of the appointed ball, the young ladies who intend to be present remain at home, dressed in the same elegant and tidy costume as we have before described to be customary in every German household at breakfast time. Indeed, as they rise from"], [58, "42 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. their beds, so do they continue till the hour comes for dressing \u2014 their face and hands being unwashed, and their hair uncombed for the whole of that time, their dinners eaten in their night-caps, and with merely a woollen petticoat and a chintz sleeping jacket to cover their bodies. The morning is occupied by the young ladies, thus scantily attired, in the ironing of their bali-skirts and stiffly starched petticoats ; while the afternoon is given up to the refur bishing of some old second-hand wreath, so as to make it pass for a new one, or else in re-trimming the ball-dress, in which they have formerly appeared, with some newly-dyed ribbon, so as to make it appear as if they were able to afford a fresh costume upon each occasion. Towards the evening, on these ball days, it is customary to see the washerwomen carrying home, on the top of a pole, some huge stiff-starched petticoat, or skirt, which, when distended to its full dimensions, has all the appearance of a monster fire balloon, made out of tissue-paper. These are for the grander young ladies, who do not themselves do the washing and ironing at home. As the evening draws in, the young ladies begin to lay aside their nightcaps, and wash themselves, for the first time that day. Then the hair is soaked in fat, so as to make it appear as glossy and tidy as if it had been brushed \u2014 for hairbrushes, so far as we could learn, were luxuries utterly unknown in the land ; so that, indeed, when any young lady had occasion to scratch her head in company (a practice by no means unusual with German gentlewomen), one could not help seeing the scurf, thus raised, clinging to the pomatum as thickly as if the tresses had been sprinkled with bran. The common custom, with even the most fashionable young women of Eisenach, is to carry a dirty small-tooth comb in their pockets, and whenever their hair becomes in any way rough while out in society, to drag forth the elegant article, and to pass it over their locks before your face ; after which, they invariably disgust every English person by running the tip of their finger nails along the teeth, and so cleanse it of the dirt which it has accumulated. When the young lady's toilette is finished, and the crowning touch of elegance is given by dusting some powder of ordinary washing-starch over the face, neck, and arms, then a handkerchief is covered with the same choice powder, so that the sweet creature may be able to flour herself as white as a plaster cast several times in the course of the evening. At the conclusion of the above elegant operations the mother"], [59, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 43 proceeds to pack a small berlin-wool carpet-bag full of such article < as she believes her daughters may stand in need of during the dances. The articles thus stowed away generally consist of three or four pocket-handkerchiefs, as many small-tooth combs as there are girls, relays of gloves, a small stock of peppermint drops or lozenges, a packet of pins, and some two or three needles and thread \u2014 the uses of these several articles will be seen hereafter. At the hour of seven (or a little before) the mother and the daughters proceed to walk through the streets, all with bare heads, and muffled up in dirty old shawls, (there was but one opera cloak in the whole town), and with the servant carrying a lantern before them ; for, owing to the deficient lighting aud paving of the city, it is impossible for the visitors to the ball to avoid the puddles which lie in the road without some such appli ance. The serving-maid is also provided with a basket, in which she carries an old pair of boots for the young ladies to put on when returning home ; though, why such economy should be necessary we could never understand, seeing that each of the girls was in the habit of dancing in black boots, or else in servant-like black-stuff shoes and sandals. Upon arriving at the club-hou=e, the party make their way to the garde-robe, as it is called, and proceed to shake out their dresses, Sec., in the presence of any gentlemen who may happen to be there, previous to their entering the ball-room. Indeed, it is impossible for an Englishman to give his own country-people a notion of the utter indelicacy of this arrangement in Germany ; for we ourselves have seen German ladies sit unabashed as they laced their boots, with their foot over one knee, before our very eyes \u2014 and it should be remembered that German men have not the same sense of respect for females as English folk. We have heard, too, at this same garde-robe of the most fashionable place of resort in Eisenach, coarse remarks from the \"gentlemen,\" who happened to be present while some lady was arranging her dress, that have made our ears tiugle for very shame that a woman could be subjected to such indecent insults. The Klemda Club-house itself is a tumble-down, rotten old building, not unlike the deserted giraffe-house on the road to Turnham Green. The ball-room is about the size of an ordinary county-court, and certainly not as large as the general run of riding-schools \u2014 the only furniture being a few red-calico curtains before the windows, as well as a few chairs and benches about as elegant as those at our Highbury Barn. At one end is a small"], [60, "44 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. gallery for the musicians, and at tbe other a larger one, where the servants of the families present are allowed to wait, and to witness the dancing uutil they are wanted. Beneath the one gallery is the card-room, and under the other the supper and wine-room ; while beyond the latter is the beer and smoking-hall for the ac commodation of those chandlers and shop-boys present at the ball, who prefer to indulge in the luxuries of sausages, small beer, and tobacco. The attendant at the cloak-room is allowed the pri vilege of selling for a penny apiece small strips of paper, on which the order of the dances of the evening is inscribed. Many of the more penurious of the young ladies, however, are in the habit of tricking the attendant of the dues by writing down beforehand the titles of such dances as they know to be usual on those occa sions, aud affixing the numbers indicative of the order for the evening, by copying them from some one of the lists that have been purchased by their friends. It is customary with the young ladies who are anxious to be engaged for every dance throughout the night to go as early as possible, and many are there at least an hour before the appointed time ; so that they may have their lists filled up with partners before the greater portion of the com pany arrive. Upon grand occasions, such as the anniversary of the founding of the Club, and during the Christmas and Easter holidays, the ball is usually commenced by dancing the \" Polonnaise \" as it is called, and in this almost every person present takes part. The ladies and gentlemen at first walk round the room hand in hand in procession, forming one long line of couples, and moving along as stiff and stately as was the custom in the days of the old Minuet de la Cour. When the tour of the room has been thus made, some two or three times, to the air of our \" God save the Queen,\" (which the Germans have appropriated to themselves under the title of \" Heil dir des Sieges Eranz,\") the ladies and gentlemen, following the course indicated by the first couple, separate \u2014 the ladies filing off in one direction, the gentlemen in another. Then they proceed to describe all manner of curious devices and pretty figures \u2014 the long hne of the procession, as they walk slowly along, now seeming to undulate like a moving snake, and now to form some ingeniously-arranged maze ; until, after some quarter of an hour or twenty minutes of contiuually-changing figures, the measured strains of the music suddenly cease, and some lively polka is substituted ; whereupon the several couples set off jigging round the room as a sign that the evening's festi-"], [61, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 45 tivities have commenced. On the occasion of the Schiller Feast in Eisenach, some three years ago, this same \" Polonnaise \" was danced on the Market Place \u2014 almost the whole of the citizens taking part in the ceremony ; upon which occasion the letters of the Poet's name were formed by the long line of persons, in the course of the figures. The dances which usually succeed the Polonnaise at the Klemda ball are polkas, waltzes, Tyroliennes, and galoppes \u2014 the Mazourka and Schotisse being seldom danced in Eisenach. The old Eng lish quadrille, however, is danced some two or three times in the course of the evening, for this the Germans believe to be a great novelty recently invented in France, and therefore known by them under the title of the \" Franchise.\""], [62, "CHAPTER VI. A BALL AT THE \" KLEMDA \" (CONTINUED). The most peculiar dance performed at these \" Klemda \" balls is that which passes by the name of the German cotillion, and which consists of a series of games, rather than figures, superadded to the old French measure. This dance is always reserved for the conclusion of the evening's entertainment, when the ladies and gentlemen draw their chairs from the side of the room, and seat themselves in a large circle towards the centre of the dancing hall ; after which some of the young ladies proceed to tie a knot in one corner of their handkerchief, and then, doubling the knotted end into the form of a bow, do the like with the other three corners, in which no knot has been made ; so that the several ends being held in the palm of the hand, it shall be diffi cult to tell which is the knotted comer, and which the unknotted ones, belonging to the bows left projecting above. Thus prepared, the damsel approaches any gentleman whom she may please to seek for a partner, and, presenting to him the several bows of the handkerchief, he selects one of them ; and while the lady holds the ends still firmly clasped in her palm, the gentleman is thus led. with his finger aud thumb grasping the bow he has chosen, towards a second partner, to whom the handkerchief ends are in the same manner presented. When he, in his turn, has taken hold of another of the bows, the couple are conducted by the lady as before to a thud cavalier ; and immediately this one has grasped the remaining bow (for the lady keeps one of the unknotted corners for herself) the ends are drawn from the hand, and the gentleman who has selected the corner with the knot to it is claimed as the lady's partner for the dance. The others are left to try their luck once more with some other Fraulein, or else to console themselves with the brief pleasure of an \" extra tour,\" as"], [63, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 47 it is called, during the pauses of the dance ; for it is the custom in Germany for gentlemen who are unable to procure partners for the waltz, or polka, that is about to commence, to wait until some of the couples halt for a few minutes' rest, and then to approach the gentleman to whom the coveted lad}- is engaged, raid beg that he may be allowed \u2014 if the Fraulein be not too tired \u2014 the honour of dancing an additional round or two with her. Another pastime indulged in during this same cotillion is to lead one of the most admired of the German coquettes out into the middle of the room, and to arrange a table aud toilette-glass there, in front of which the saucy flirt is seated. Then the gentlemen are brought forth, one by one, and presented to her behind her back ; and as she sees their figures reflected in the mirror before her, she either shakes her head or bows towards the looking-glass as a sign that such company is either displeasing or acceptable to her. It usually happens, however, that the head is shaken as repeatedly as the gentlemen are successively pre sented to the damsel at her back ; for the vain young Fraulein loves to hear the titters and jeers of the people in the room, as the hand of each swain after the other is rejected by her. A third sprightly variety of the same dauce consists in the re moval of the toilette-glass, and in placing upon the little table before described a large papier mdchi model of a heart, a small velvet slipper, made after the fashion of a watchpocket, and a tiny basketful of artificial flowers. Then the lady being seated in front of these three different articles, a fresh triad of gentlemen are conducted to the table before her, when she presents the slipper to the one whom she thinks is likely to be ruled by his wife \u2014 the monster brown-paper heart to him with whom she de sires to dance, and the basket to the one whose hand she wishes to reject with scorn ; for in Germany it is the same insult \u2014 in the vernacular \u2014 to give a gentleman \" the corb,\" or basket (since it is supposed to be the special office of women only to carry burdens in that country), as in our own land it is \u2014 vulgarly speaking \u2014 \" to give him the sack.\" The balls proper last only throughout the winter months of the year, and during the summer-time such balls are changed for what the Germans call \" Tanz-Vergniigen\" (dancing amusement), rather than a formal party. On such occasions, after coffee or tea has been partaken of in the gardens, where the band plays from about Your till eight, the company retire to the ball-room, where polkas, waltzes, and Tyroliennes are kept up till midnight."], [64, "48 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. At these parties the costumes, both for ladies and gentlemen, are such as it would be impossible to find in the lowest casino in London \u2014 the gentlemen appearing in any kind of speckled or coloured pantaloons, with the dirtiest possible boots and gloves \u2014 if indeed the latter luxuries be thought in any way necessary \u2014 and the ladies being attired in the commonest print dresses, made with low necks (for such is thought to be the high touch of summer fashion in Eisenach), and each wearing some dowdy trumpery wreath on her head. So that an English person, when he first witnesses the entertainment, cannot help believing that he has tumbled, by accident, into some servants' hall, where the valets and the footmen are having a hop with the ladies'-maids and other serving-women of some English nobleman's establish ment. Upon other and grander occasions, the cotton-priut low-necked ball-dress is laid aside for one of \"book-muslin,\" or bright-tinted tartalan. Hence, every young lady appears a mass of green, or pink, or bright yellow, or light blue, and with their dresses trimmed merely with braces or Medici girdles, in sarcenet of the strongest possible contrast ; so that damsels in white delight to deck themselves out in black ribbons \u2014 those in pink with green ones \u2014 bright yellow with red trimmings, and so forth ; for taste in such matters is utterly unknown to the young ladies of Eise nach. Add to this a pair of black stuff boots to dance in, and a wreath about as trumpery and as conspicuous as that worn by the ladies of the corps de ballet at the Italian Opera in England, and the reader may perhaps conceive the amount of display and frippery prevalent on such occasions. The gentlemen, we must in all justice admit, appear far better dressed than the members of the fair sex at such grand ceremonies. True, they have one and all very much the look of English waiters \u2014 white waistcoats and white cravats, and black coats and trousers being the order of \u2666he day. Nevertheless, there is no attempt at petty finery on their part, and assuredly the commoner classes of men in Germany dress better, and behave themselves better in ball rooms than the same members of society in our own country. At the balls of the \" Lieder-Tafel,\" indeed, we have seen barbers and bootmakers, and butchers dressed as neatly and unostenta tiously, and found them dance as well, and behave as politely as even gentlefolks with us ; for, to be candid, the artizan and lower classes of Germany are as far ahead of our people in this respect as the German gentlefolks are behind our gentry in the same quality."], [65, "49 A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. Nor is this all. If the shabby show and tawdry finery of the girls themselves on such occasions be hateful to every person of the least taste and refinement, assuredly the wretched dowdy ap pearance of the old mothers who accompany them, and sit ranged against the wall \u2014 each in a dingy black stuff gown and a bit of black net on her head by way of cap, and with her large carpet bag like reticule lyiug in her lap \u2014 constitutes a sight as strange as it is pitiable to every English gentleman when he beholds it for the first time. Another peculiarity of such balls at the \" Klemda\" is, that never a father of a family is to be seen in the dancing-hall. The mothers are there, Heaven knows, to a surfeit ! each ready to wait upon the daughters whom they have accompanied ; and the sons are there dancing away with their female friends of the town, but the fathers are all at the beer-houses, playing \" sixty-six,\" and drinking their penuy glasses of ale. As the conversation grows warmer and louder, if possible, on every side, you hear the polite dames exclaim to those from whom they may happen to differ in opinion, \" That's not true\" (Das ist nicht ivahr) ! or cry aloud, \" You're a liar !\" Or else you will see some of the more playful ladies, such as the young wife of the Captain Winternase, put her fingers to her nose in the middle of the ball-room, as if she thought it one of the most elegant antics that the daughter of a Berlin banker could indulge in, to \" take a sight\" at the gentleman with whom she happened to be in con versation. Or maybe you will notice the Mrs. Doctorin Kreuz spriinger performing the pantomime of scraping a carrot as she projects the forefinger of one hand, and rubs it with the forefinger of the other, right under the nose of the officer and gentleman with whom she may chance to be jesting \u2014 crying the while \" Schabe ! schabe Bubchen !\" (scrape ! scrape a carrot !) after the fashion of the boys in the streets of Eisenach. Now, the English lady who reads these lines must not imagine that the above is, in any way, an overdrawn picture of the manners of the women in polite society in Saxony. So far from swearing being the exception with the Saxon ladies, it is rather the rule for every young as well as old gentlewoman to utter an unmeaning oath, calling upon either God or Jesus, whenever she is astonished at what she happens to hear. Nor did we ever find the highest gentleman or lady in the land civil enough to do other, when they chanced to doubt whatever you might communi cate to them, than tell you, to your face, such a statement was 4"], [66, "50 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. not true, or that it was a lie \u2014 for such polite forms of expression as \" I beg your pardon,\" or \" you must have been mistaken,\" or \"are wrongly informed upon the point in question,\" are, so far as our experience goes, utterly unknown, even in the highest classes. We should, however, on the other hand, admit, in all candour, that the vulgar antics of \" taking a sight\" and \" scraping a carrot,\" which we have above described as being performed by ladies in the faces of gentlemen, are generally considered to be inelegant; nevertheless, we speak of what we have seen done by women holding a high station in the town ; and that not once or twice, but often in the middle of the quadrille, without even a shrug of the shoulders, or any other expression of astonishment, but rather a titter of approbation from the company, who happened with ourselves to witness the extremely lady-like gestures. Now, the master of the ceremonies comes forward, and claps his hands as a signal for the first waltz, whereupon the infantry officers begin to unbuckle the long cavalry swords with steel scabbards, which they delight upon all occasions to drag along the ground (for these worthies never appear in plain clothing upon such occasions) ; and after having brushed their hair in the middle of the ball-room proceed to claim the partners they have engaged for the dance ; while the shop-boys at the money changer's, or the clerks at the colour factory, approach those damsels whom they have chosen, and with a stiff, formal bow, after the fashion of English youths at school, beg that they may be allowed the honour, &c. Accordinglv, the Frauleins give themselves the last rub up to the roots of their hair, and even behind their ears and under their chin, with their pocket-hand kerchief they hold 'in readiness in their haud, and then throwing it to the dowdy old mother behind them, away the sweet creatures go twirling round, till their crinolines, and their absence of under clothing, reveal such sights as a person of any refinement blushes to behold in any decent assembly in the world. The waltz being ended, the young ladies are brought back to their mothers, while the gentlemen and officers go off to talk to their male friends as before ; and then begins, again, the same Babel of screaming women as previously described. Each mother has now drawn from the abyss of her carpet-bag a fresh and dry pocket-handkerchief in readiness for their daughters after the ex ertion of the dance. \" Dear God !\" cries one elegant young creature, as she stands gasping after her long waltzing, \" Give me the handkerchief,"], [67, "A BALL AT THE KLF::DA. 51 mother, for I am sweating frightfully\" (it is impossible for a young lady to say in German that she perspires freely) ; where upon all the darlings begin literally mopping the moisture off their face, ueck, shoulders, and arms ; and, so far from such an office being considered in auy way indelicate to be performed in public, you have but to look round the room to see every young lady engaged in the same refined occupation \u2014 each really scrub bing themselves with the mouchoir hauded to them, and rubbing away \u2014 in at the creases under their chin and round their nose \u2014 as if they thought it a meritorious, rather than a repulsive, act to make their toilette in the presence of gentlemen. Then the old mothers stow away the wet haudkerehiefs in the depths of their carpet-bag, and having supplied their dear girls with a few rasp berry drops, and the small-tooth comb as before, proceed to shake out the young ladies' skirts and flounces \u2014 which done, the con versation takes a more general turn. Then the Countess von Bittererde begins to tell the Lady of Hogstown (Frau von Schwein'sdorf ) what she had for dinner that day, and to assure her how she ate herself so \"sat\" (full \u2014 the common expression with ladies in Eisenach) with potatoe dump lings and prunes, that she is really unable to taste a bit of the \" gracious lady's excellent lard cake which her gracious ladyship is so kind as to offer her.\" The Fraulein von Frisky comes skipping clumsily up to the little pug-nosed Appellations-Gericht-Rathin Kranky, who imme diately tells the girl how beautiful she looks in that daffodil wreath and cherry-coloured dress, with the Magenta ribbons ; and no sooner has the dame uttered the words than she commences rubbing each of the articles, and inquiring what they respectively cost the yard \u2014 not forgetting to inform the young lady, as the other mentions the prices, that \" it isn't true ;\" adding, in all the extreme frankness of primitive life, that they are not worth one half what the Fraulein states she had paid for them, and that it was a \" great swindle\" (grosse Schwindel) to charge so much for such poor stuff.\" And no sooner has the Fraulein von Frisky taken her departure than the Lady Town-Councillor turns to her neighbour and says, hi a squeaky voice, \" It wonders me how those girls can afford to dress as they do, for with butter at the price it is \u2014 and I paid as much as six-and-a-half groschens for the pound I bought at the market this day \u2014 God in Heaven knows I can hardly manage to buy a new cap-ribbon for myself.\" Whereupon the two dames proceed to discuss the market prices"], [68, "52 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of every article ; now one asks the other what she gave for potatoes, or else how much she paid for the Schock of cabbages to make Sauer-kraut with, or when they intend to kill their pig, and how many pounds it might weigh, and how much beautiful fat (schone Speck) they expected to get from it. Other ladies at the same time commence indulging in petty disparagements concerning the dresses of those present. \" Look at the Frau Doctorin Kreuzspriinger yonder !\" says one old crone to the other ; \"how grand she thinks herself in that green Per sian skirt of hers, but \u2014 Ach ! the thousand !\" (another favourite oath with the ladies here) \" it is nothing but that old summer dress that has been dyed \u2014 for she stood just in front of me, so that I had a good look at it \u2014 and it could never have cost more than ten groschens a yard when it was new.\" \" Oh, Jesus !\" cries another of the most fashionable dames, \" look at those Frauleins Giraffe \u2014 how ever they manage to dress as they do is a mystery to the whole town.\" \" Oh, they buy a lot of the left-off dresses from the ladies of the Court at Weimar!\" exclaims a third dame in a black stuff gown. \" The Fraulein von Milchsuppe has just been telling me that the elder one bought that pink tartalan dress and fuchsia wreath she is now wearing from one of the ladies-in-waiting for a thaler and a half.\" In corroboration of the statement it may be mentioned that it is the common practice with the ladies of all classes to sell their old clothes to their servants, so that serving maids have hardly been in your house a week before they ask you if you have a pair of old boots you can let them buy of you ; and when you tell them it is the custom of ladies in England to give, and not to sell, their left-off clothes to their waiting-maids, the astonished girls stare at you as if they really thought there was some truth in the German saying, which describes our country folk as being verriickte Englander (mad English people). Then the band strikes up once more, and a polka or Tyrolienne, as the case may be, is indulged in while the httle officers stand with their legs astraddle \u2014 as if to make the most of themselves \u2014 and with an eye-glass at one eye, grouped in front of the supper room doors, watching the young ladies spin round and round as if they were dancing for a wager, and nudging one another aud simpering as the petticoats fly up somewhat beyond the bounds of decency. Thus the time passes till about nine, when a longer pause ensues, so that supper may be partaken of by such as please to pay for it."], [69, "53 A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. Now, the English reader must not imagine a supper at the ball at the \" Klemda\" to be in any way similar to those elegant and expensive entertainments which are supplied by confectioners at ten shillings or a guinea a-head towards the conclusion of dances in our own country ; for the \" Klemda\" ball-supper consists of nothing but hot beefsteaks or smoking cutlets, or baked goose and potatoes cooked in fat, to be followed, maybe, by herring salads, or a dish of raw ham or sausage ; or such other luxuries as the wretched kitchen of the landlord who rents the little club \" tap\" may be able to provide. However, to give the reader a more vivid notion of the delicacy of these ball repasts, we here append the bill of fare usual upon such occasions. It is copied from one of the printed lists which are left lying about on the supper-tables ; and thus the reader will not only be able to see the kind of dishes generally partaken of, but, as the prices are affixed in English money, to understand also the nature of the costly banquet the visitor has to look forward to.

The younger ladies are seldom if ever invited to them. True, at the Christmas or Easter balls we have seen one or two treated to champagne on such extra grand occasions ; but as an ordinary rule the gentlemen sit"], [70, "54 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. there alone, eating their raw herrings and potato salad, and lapping up the sauce with their knives, and afterwards washing down the meal with balsa bottle of some of the cheaper and sourer wines ; for a German palate is so accustomed to vinegar that or dinary Deutschers are wont to believe that the bottled acetic acid which is sold as Rhenish table-wine has all the flavour of the juice of ripe grapes appertaining to it. During the supping hour it is customary with the ladies re maining in the ball-room to order a cup of tea (and such tea .') of the waiting-maid who attends on such occasions ; while some of the younger ones regale themselves with a glass of lemonade. Then a few slices of dry white bread-cake or apple-cake are drawn from out that corpulent carpet-bag-like reticule, where it has been lying all the while, side by side with the filthy small-tooth comb, and in company with the wet pocket-handkerchiefs which the young ladies have returned to their mother, after drying their skins with them. And there the ladies sit sipping and munch ing the sippets of cake until their cups or glasses are empty. Sometimes these cups of tea, or glasses of lemonade, are sent by the gentlemen to the ladies; though this is so far from being usual, that the act is considered as a mark of special favour on the part of the young man who may order such costly refreshment for his former partner in the dance. After supper, during the interval in which the gentlemen are indulging in a more extensive and solid repast in the adjoining room, the young ladies walk about, arm in arm, in twos and threes, up and down the \" Saal,\" while the shop-boys who have tossed off their penny glass of beer, in the veritable tap-room which adjoins the grander supping saloon (for in the latter nothing but wine is allowed to be drunk) these boys stand in a group in the centre of the dancing-room, talking with one another, and utterly unmindful of the ladies about them. In fine, it is the fashion in Saxony for the men merely to dance with the women : for no sooner is the waltz or polka finished than the lady is led back as quickly as possible and deposited by the side of her mother \u2014 the gentleman not thinking it worth his while to ex change a word with her afterwards ; while, as for the old mothers themselves, they rarely receive more than a passing nod from any of their male acquaintances. Seldom or never did we see a gentleman speak to any of the elderly ladies for more than a minute together ; for the usual lot of the poor wretched things is to sit against the walls of the room"], [71, "A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. 55 without exchanging a word with a soul, except' the equally deso late old crones next to them. And this is their fate every ball night, from seven till often two or three in the morning, their only occupation being, as we have said, to play the waiting-maid to their girls \u2014 to keep them supplied with relays of pocket handkerchiefs, and to feed them with raspberry drops as fast as required \u2014 while their only refreshment during these long hours is a cup of the weakest and nastiest possible tea, and a slice of sweet dough-cake taken from their musty carpet-bags. What wonder, then, that you have but to look round the ball-room to wards midnight to see every one of the heads of the aged dames in black stuff nodding away, as though they were so many plaster casts of cats with movable necks ranged along the board of some Italian image-seller ? Nor do these miserable old women get many thanks for the ungracious offices they consent to perform ; for we have heard the daughters address them, and indeed order them, with far less politeness than an English young lady would dream of exhibiting towards her regular serving-woman. Now one German Fraulein will cry, \" Come, mother, quick ! give me another pair of gloves ! In God's name ! how long you are, when you know I'm waiting for them ;\" and then another will exclaim, in anything but a respectful tone, \"Great God! I've torn my dress ; you must come with me, and sew it up in the garde-robe. Come along, for I'm engaged for the next Frangaise ! \" Indeed, according to our experience, the mode in which the daughters spake to their parents was so utterly wanting in all sense of duty that we are satisfied that any decent English girl would have been more shocked than even we were to hear it. But so it is in Saxony. What we said at the beginning of the chap ter we can but enforce at the end of it. The German mother, in the hope of getting her daughters married, as soon after fifteen as possi ble, begins washing and starching the girls' ball-dresses and petti coats immediately after their confirmation, and drags them about with her to every concert or dance given among her own society ; while she consents to sit there, with her back against the wall, taking no more part in the amusements, and being as utterly disregarded by. all the gentlemen present, as if she were one of the cook-maids in the Klemda Gallery. And though the mother begins this species of servitude the very moment her girls have left school, with the view of their catching some \" man \" before they are out of their teens, her bond-slavery in this way generally lasts for ten years at least ; for, as a rule, the women marry much later than"], [72, "56 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. with us, so that the mothers are mostly wrinkled and shrivelled old women by the time their daughters' dancing days commence. Indeed, full one-half of the so-called \" young \" ladies who were in the habit of visiting every Klemda ball were playful little kittens of thirty, if they were a day. \" Who is that middle-aged lady ? \" said we, to a German friend, \" who is waltzing with the officer, and spinning over the floor, as if she were some child's humming-top just let loose from the string?\" \" Oh ! she is the daughter of the Baron von Bettler,\" was the answer. \" She has danced here for the last fifteen years, to my knowledge, and will have to wear many other pair of boots out, before she can find a gentleman ready to exchange rings with her. She has no money, you see, and then the girls, with us, may dance till they are grey ; but, I suppose, it is the same all over the world, a lady with grey hair and an empty pocket must go to church only to pray, and pass the rest of her days in hugging the children of the poor rather than her own. Do you see that buxom lady there, in white muslin, dressed like a young girl ? She is one of the pet lambs that has seen forty sheep-shearings at least, and though she has danced with as many \" forest-men \" in her time as would be sufficient to clear the backwoods of America, she is but just now newly betrothed to that long thin gentleman with the sandy mustachios whom she has got so fast by the arm. And yet, poor thing, they say in the town that he is only a swindler, and has told it openly in the beer-house that he will never marry her unless she can bring him 2000 thalers (\u00a3300). So what is to become of her, I do not know, since she has only 1500 thalers (\u00a3225) to bless any man with. Oh, yes ! we know every groschen the girls have got here ; and it is no use their dancing unless we fancy we can hear the thalers jingle in their pockets as they go.\" The after-supper ceremonies at the \" Klemda \" are briefly told. Then riot, rather than refined revelry, often prevails Those officers who have indulged in wine, and the shop-boys who have taken an extra glass of beer, begin to dance the Frangaise with all kinds of antics ; the more sprightly and fast of the ladies keeping pace with them in the imaginary sport, and practising such violent gestures as the male traveller may have seen per formed at \"Mabile,\" or in the dancing-gardens of the Quartier Latin in Paris \u2014 but certainly not in any well-conducted ball-room"], [73, "57 A BALL AT THE KLEMDA. in either France or England. At such times it is the wont of the gentlemen, while performing the \" grand chain,\" to rush round and round as if they were so many red Indians engaged in some maddening war-dance. And it was at this period of the evening we ourselves saw one of the drunken military surgeons, while waltzing, fall with his partner prostrate on the floor. And what think you became of the \" officer and gentleman \" who was guilty of it ? Why, he was picked up, and quietly conducted home by his comrades ; and the next ball, there the fellow was, admitted into the same company, and dancing away with the very same young lady \u2014 as if neither men nor women considered that any indignity had been offered to their society. These balls always conclude with the German cotillion, the dancing of which continues sometimes for one or two hours ; after which it is the fashion for the gentlemen to send the ladies a cup of hot soup or coffee, according to taste. Then the ladies and gentlemen retire ensemble to the dressing-room, where the fair, but not in any way bashful, creatures proceed to place their ankles across their knees and unlace their boots under the very eyes of those with whom they have been lately flirting. On extra grand occasions, however, the dancing is kept up till daylight, and then it is the custom for the young ladies to make parties with the gentlemen to go up to the Wartburg to break fast ; and there they sit drinking beer or coffee, and eating sausages in the common room of the public-house until the sun is high above the horizon. And when you happen to meet the elegant damsels in the course of the next day, they do not blush to tell you, in the vernacular of their country, that they are suffering from \" katzenjammer \" \u2014 literally \"cat's misery\" (or, as fast gentle men would phrase it in English, \" blue devils \") \u2014 that being the German term applied by inordinate beer-drinkers to the sensation which succeeds over-indulgence od the previous night."], [74, "CHAPTER VII. THE AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIAN PEOPLE. Let us now proceed to give the reader a detailed account, not only of the ordinary amusements of the German people, but also to show him how large a proportion of their petty incomes is de voted to unnecessary enjoyments ; and then, by letting him see how little remains for the common necessities of life, teach him why it is that potatoes and black bread, and straw beds and bare floors, are the usual comforts of a German gentleman's home. It must be borne in mind that 300 \u2014 400 thalers, or \u00a345 \u2014 \u00a360 per annum, is by no means a small sum of money for a gentleman to receive yearly in the Thuringian capital. It will hereafter be seen, by the official accounts, that the city judge (the Stadt-richter, or deputy-magistrate) gets no more than \u00a360 per annum. We should add, too, that the statements hereafter given, as to the average expenditure of each father of a family, or grown male person in middle-class of life, have been prepared in company with Germans themselves, and that whenever two different sums have been mentioned as to the amount devoted to this or that particular enjoyment, we have invariably preferred to adopt the lower figure, so that the general expense might be kept as moderate as possible. First and foremost, then, come the items of beer-drinking and smoking, which, at the lowest calculation, must be taken at five groschens, or sixpence a-day, for six days in the week, and this gives us a gross outlay of 52 thalers, or \u00a37 15s. in the course of the year. After this, we have the expenses of the Sundays, and these, in almost every case, amount to 1 5 groschens, or Is. Gd. throughout the day ; for it is the general custom iu Eisenach for the citizens to begin dropping into the beer-houses at ten in the morning. Indeed, hardly a grown man in the town ever dreams"], [75, "AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. 59 of going to church \u2014 the congregation consisting almost entirely of the old women and children. After the mid-day dinner, a walk is usually taken to the suburbs, and a halt made at oue of the beer-gardens in the neighbourhood, or else a visit paid to the concert at the \" Fantasie \" (a tavern in the outskirts so called), where, of course, more beer is drunk. Indeed, it will be seen, by the extracts hereafter given from the journals of Thuringia, that Sunday is the principal day for amuse ments, for on the Sabbath not only are all the grand balls held, but the principal concerts given, e. g. : On Sunday, the 26th October, in case of good weather, Concert-music in the Saloon of the Fantasie. C. KENNING, Bandmaster. After this the gentleman returns home to his supper at six or seven ; and immediately this is swallowed he retires to pass the remainder of the evening, drinking, smoking, playing cards or billiards, either at the \" Felsen Keller \" (Rock-cellar), the \" Path's Keller ''(Town-councillor's cellar), or the \"Zahn-Lucke\" (Hollow- tooth), or the \" Garkiiche \" (Cook-shop), or the \" Gansens Ei \" (Goose-egg), or the \"Dunst\" (the Fog), or the \"Mohren\" (Blacka- moor), or the \" Lciwen \" (Lion), or the \" Stadt Graben \" (the Town-ditch), or the \" Engel \" (Angel), or the \" Krone \" (Crown) ; or, indeed, at any one of the forty different taverns in the town where he has been informed a good glass of beer is to be obtained. The gross sum of money thus expended on the Sundays amounts to 26 thalers, or \u00a33 18s. per annum, over and above the sum which is laid out for beer during the week-days. Next in the list come the holidays, of which there are thirteen entire days in the course of the twelvemonth ; and such is the general cessation from labour, that not even bread is baked at such times. Of these holidays three occur at Christmas, one day at the New Year, three at Easter, three at Whitsuntide, one on Ascension-day, and two on certain ordained days of so-called penance and fasting (Busse-tage) \u2014 the penance and fasting con- sisting, like the enjoyments on other holidays, in universal beer- drinking, smoking, and gambling. It is true, that divine service is performed in the churches, but the pews are empty, while the beer-house tables are crowded on such occasions. The bay win- dow of our lodgings happened to overlook the entrance to one of the principal churches in Eisenach, and (excepting on New Year's"], [76, "60 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Day, when the majority of people seemed to consider that atten dance at Divine Service once in the year was a necessary \" example \" to be set to the younger and poorer portion of the community,) we can avow that we never saw more than a dozen grown males leaving the church-doors at the conclusion of the service. Those who think church-going a test of the morals of a country may take this fact for what they consider it worth : but we cite it here to show merely that the worship of Cambrinus (the German god of beer, whose portrait hangs in almost every tavern) is the chief idolatry of the country. So early on these \"feast days\" do the merry-making ceremonies begin, that it is the usual practice for the people at Whitsuntide to go out into the woods before it is light and breakfast upon some hill -top at sunrise; nor can you get a servant to remain in the house during the holiday-time. At every one of the lower taverns during the feast-days, balls are given every night ; and to one or other of such balls every Saxon serving-maid insists upon going ; nor is it usual for the girl to return home to her bed till early the next morning. Here is an advertisement concerning the opening of a new \"dance saloon,\" resorted to principally by the servant-girls and common soldiers of the town. It will be seen that the \" inaugu ration \" of the Assembly Rooms was fixed for the first Feier-tag, which literally signifies the first consecrated or holy rest-day; for though we have rendered this word as \" holiday,\" simply because there is no equivalent term in the English language for the phrase, it must be borne in mind that such Feier-tage are distinct from ordinary English holidays ; for in Thuringia not only is all worldly work legally forbidden upon such occasions, but divine service is performed in each of the churches at least once a day during the time. For the inauguration of our new Saloon, and the lighting of the same with gas, we hold, on the first holiday evening, a large Concert, which is to be given by Herr Henning, to which the highly -honored public is hereby most friendly invited. Admission, for gentlemen, 2i groschens (threepence Eng lish), for ladies 1\u00a3 groschens (lid.) Commencement at 7\u00a3 o'clock. SOPHIE and ANNA HAETUNG. Hotel zum \"Mohren.\" N.B. On the second and third holiday a Ball will be given in the \"Mohren\" Saloon, to which admission will be refused to all those dancers who nails in their boots have !"], [77, "AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. 61 The latter part of the previous advertisement will afford the Eng lish reader a vivid idea as to the polite nature of the guests con gregated together at such dances. We should add, however, in all fairness, that so far from such dances being a type of the more respectable assemblies of the town's-folk, that the public prohibi tion of nails in the boots of the dancers, by the landladies of the tavern, was considered an excellent joke in the city.; and roars of laughter ensued at the theatre when the low comedian, in allusion to the announcement, assured the audience that a blacksmith was kept at the doors for the purpose of extracting the hob-nails from the boots of the ladies and gentlemen, previous to then- waltzing. For weeks before these holidays occur every kind of privation is submitted to at home in order to save up for the enjoyment \u2014 the common remark being, \" Oh ! we must be sparesome now, the feast days are near at hand.\" Among the better-to-do, at the holiday time, it is the practice to club together and hire a cart, along which planks are arranged, so that some eighteen or twenty persons may be seated in it as in the pleasure vans \u2014 \u25a0 popular among our working-classes and school-children \u2014 and these go off for a day's excursion into the country. Many of the younger men make up \" walking parties \" into tbe Thuringian Forest, or to the top of the Inselsberg ; while those who remain behind wander out to the taverns in the outskirts, at some one of which there is sure to be a concert, and at others a ball. On such occasions we are informed that every grown male in middle-class life spends, at least, one thaler the day ; and this for thirteen such days makes a gross expenditure of thirteen thalers, or \u00a31 19s. in the course of the year. Another grand feast, held in every German town in the course of the twelvemonth, is what is termed the \"bird-shooting,\" at which a large wooden image of an eagle is the target ; and he who shoots away the last remaining portion of the bird is pro claimed king of the shooters for the next year, and becomes the winner of a small prize. Any person who pleases to pay 20 groschens for the sport, may have the pleasure of shooting at the carved block of wood, and for this sum he gets either one or two shots, according to the number of subscribers on the occasion. The skill displayed at such times is but poor school -boy work at best, and the rifles used almost as lumbering as blunderbusses. Everyone shoots with a rest, and the top of the gun is generally fitted with no end of optical apparatus, such as telescopic glasses, and three or four sight-holes along the barrel to ensure a perfect"], [78, "62 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. aim ; but notwithstanding all this paraphernalia, the majority miss the mark\u2014 it taking at least six days' continual firing before every bit of wood is brought to the ground, although the distance is but a hundred yards at best. Indeed, the German riflemen will hardly credit that our volunteers are in the habit of shooting, aye, and hitting the mark, too, at from 600 to 1000 paces ; and one gentleman, who professed to have been a celebrated German sportsman (!) in his day, obliged us by telling us that it was not possible to make a gun that would carry a bullet, with anything like certainty, at such a range. During this same bird-shooting, a small fair is held in the out skirts of the city. Here large drinking-booths are erected, cir cuses and \" round-abouts \" set up, dancing-bears brought, peep shows established, and sheds put together for gambling at \" loto ;\" for, during the whole week, it is the practice for the entire townspeople to retire to the scene \u2014 some immediately after din ner, others later in the evening \u2014 and to stay out there drinking and gambling till late every night. Indeed, many a person then does not think of returning home until one or two in the morning. On such occasions, we were informed, it is customary for almost every grown male in the town to spend 20 groschens, or 2s. daily, and this for six days brings the amount to 4 thalers or 1 2s. de voted yearly by each of the citizens to this form of amusement. While dealing with the tavern habits of the Saxon people, it is important that we should not omit to mention the sums of money they are in the habit of spending either in cards, billiards, or skittle-playing. Most of the citizens in Eisenach belong to some skittle-club, the meetings of which are held once in the week at one of the taverns in the neighbourhood \u2014 and among the forty beer-houses in the town there are no less than twelve skittle grounds \u2014 so that the reader can imagine how general the game must be among the people. Now each of such games costs one penny (even when no money is played for), aud some two or three groschens are often lost or won at that peculiar form of the game which the Germans call Brcit. Moreover, there are, at least, eight billiard-tables distributed throughout the forty taverns. Here, again, each game costs a groschen, and when \" pool \" is played, as it often is, in the evening, the stakes are three-half pence each player. Further, card-playing at every one of the beer-houses is so common, that it certainly is the exception with the tavern frequenters not to play their two or three games at"], [79, "AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. 63 \" sixty-six,'' or \" Scat,\" for stakes which range from the twelfth to the sixth of a penny English ; nevertheless, small as the stakes may seem, many a groschen exchanges hands in the course of the evening. This universal gambling, indeed, is another of the evils begotten by the universal pot-house practices of the Saxon people. A man cannot sit drinking and talking snip-snip all the evening through ; and therefore, to while away the time in the tavern, cards and every other low art are introduced, so that the beer-drinker may be seduced into sitting longer, and drinking deeper, than he otherwise would. After consulting with the best-informed Germans as to the amount of money thus wasted bv their countryman in the course of each week, we are assured that 10 groscheus, or Is. a man, is a very moderate estimate ; but even this sum, small as it seems, amounts in the course of the year to \u00a32 12s., which has to be added to the other unneces- sary expenses before mentioned. IBut even as the beer-house habits of the Germans naturally be- get habits of card-playing, billiard and skittle-playing, and, indeed, all those low forms of gaming, which the louters at public-houses delight to indulge in ; so does the love of gambling thus engen- dered give rise, in its turn, to an utter distrust in those forms of industry and enterprise as the means of obtaining wealth, which are the marked characteristics of our countrymen. Iu Germany, however, the people, thus educated night after night in the ta- verns, have lost all belief in self-reliance, and put such faith in lotteries, as the means of amassiug riches, that there is hardly a well-to-do man, or merchant, who does not spend his five thalers a-year in the purchase of an eighth share in some one or other of the Government wheels of fortune throughout the country ; and so jealous are the petty rulers of the Principalities lest the people under their despotic control should gamble in any lottery but that iu which they have some special interest, that there is generally in each community a law restricting every person from gambling in any other than the Grand Duke's own particular \" hell \" This was the case in Saxe Weimar. Every person who pla3'ed in any other lottery than that of Leipzig (which belongs to the King of Saxony) was liable to a heavy fine ; but iu that he was welcome to beggar every person belonging to him, because the heartless authorities happened to be enriched by such means. Nor does the love of gambling thus begotten end here. In the neighbouring capital of Gotha, at the time of the \" bird-shooting,\" a roulette table is allowed by the brother of our own Prince"], [80, "64 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Albert, from which the Grand Duke Ernst thinks it no disgrace to derive 2000 thalers every year ; and thither the Eisenach citizens and master tradesmen, and, indeed, even the journeymen, were in the habit of wending their way ; but, though we heard of many a one who was obliged to walk back, because he had not even the money left to pay his railway expenses, we never knew of one silly gambler who had gained even a thaler or two by the trip."], [81, "CHAPTER VIII. THE AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIAN PEOPLE (CONTINUED). We now come to the expenses incurred by the female members of every German household in connection with beer-gardens and taverns ; for, though it is not the custom with Saxon ladies to visit public-houses at night-time, it is considered to be by no means un-ladylike to frequent the same places in the afternoon. Indeed, it is the invariable custom for the wives of officers, daugh ters of judges, and even for the family of the lord chamberlain and the mayor and deputy-mayors to stroll out twice or thrice a-week to one or other of the suburban taverns, and there drink their coffee, or glass of beer, with, it may be, a half-pint of raspberry lemonade as a finish to the entertainment. But even iu these boorish practices there is a would-be fashion ; for you are told that no lady can be seen at this public-house on a Monday, though on a Tuesday or a Thursday it is considered the \" correct thing \" for a gentlewoman to appear there. To the tavern at Fischbach all the most \" elegant \" ladies in the town were in the habit of flocking every Tuesday and Thursday. To the little drinking cabin on top of the mountain, called the \" Holxe Sonne,\" it was the mode to pay a visit every Monday and Friday. In the sum mer time it was thought fashionable for the ladies to frequent the beer-house called the \" Fantasie \" every Tuesday and Saturday ; and so it went on, there was a particular day for each of the gentlewomen to visit each of the public-houses in the suburbs. These visits usually occur between the hours of three and six, it being the custom to assemble there shortly after dinner, and to remain until nearly supper time. On such occasions, the ladies generally take their cake or their rolls and sausage wrapped up in paper in their pocket, and these they eat with their coffee ; it being the common custom at such times for the gentlewomen. 5"], [82, "66 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. both young and old, to throw a lump of sugar into their mouth, and then to suck the coffee through it ; and, when this elegant operation has been gone through, to dip the sippets of cake, or the bits of rolls they have brought with them, into the cup, and lap up the wet mess until the whole has disappeared. After this a glass of beer, or raspberry lemonade, is the usual beverage par taken of by the sweet creatures ; and there they sit knitting and talking scandal in the public-house till, as we have said, the hour for their \" man's \" supper draws near. In this manner we are convinced, and moreover confirmed and upheld in our opinion by many of the most respectable citizens of Eisenach, that at least between five aDd ten groschens are ex pended by every well-to-do family in the week. At such times the mother and daughter are present ; and saying that the ladies resort only twice in the week to the beer-house, and spend only 2|d. each on either occasion, the sum-total amounts to the larger sum before mentioned. However, to be within the mark let us adopt the lower estimate, and we thus come to the conclusion that at least 8 thalers, 20 groschens (\u00a31 6s. English) is squandered every year by every German household in this manner. Remember, we are not speaking of individual practices but national customs, and in the estimate we adopt we have again preferred the lower to the higher calculation. Moreover, every person above the grade of a working man in Eisenach belongs to one or other of the two clubs in the town, the \"Klemda,\" or the \" Erholung,\" as they are called, the former being the institution of the gentry, so to speak, and the latter of the citizens ; though the one seems to be in the same state of bewilderment as to where gentry ends and citizenship begins, as the other is as to the ultimatum of citizenship, and the beginning of servitude. At the \" Klemda,\" shop-boys and chandler's-shop keepers are allowed to rank among the \" superior classss ;\" while at the \" Erholung,\" decent, well-conducted girls, who happen to serve in pastry-cooks' shops, are excluded as servants, even though linen-drapers' young men, actiDg in the same capacity, are admitted as gentlemen at the more fashionable institution. The subscription to these so-called clubs ranges from 3 thalers 15 gros., to 3 thalers 20 gros., or from 10s. Gd. to Ils. the year; though we need hardly inform the English reader that such in stitutions are as unlike English clubs, in all their appurtenances and comforts, as a Casino is unlike Alniack's, or a Music Hall unlike the Italian Opera. However, with such forms of life it is"], [83, "67 AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. not our purpose to deal at the present moment, our object being merely to calculate the amount of money which the Germans give up to such indulgences ; so, taking the subscription to the \"Erholung,\" or lower club, as the rule, we have the yearly ex pense of 3 thalers 15 gros., or 10s. Gd. devoted by each head of a family to the maintenance of the Eisenach clubs in the course of the twelvemonth. Now, at each of these clubs, it is customary to hold a ball every fortnight throughout the winter, for, as we have said before, the gentry are too poor to give such entertainments, as with us, at their own houses ; and at each of these balls the average amount of expenditure is, at the very least, fifteen groschens every two weeks, and then multiplying these fortnightly dances by twenty six, we have a gross expense of 13 thalers, or \u00a31 19s. per annum. Previous to any winter ball or summer dancing-amusement taking place at either of the clubs of Eisenach, an advertisement is inserted in the little hand bill of a newspaper. Such adver tisements are generally to the following effect ; the following translations being literatim and verbatim, so that the English reader may have a sense of the odd German phraseology in such matters. For the members of the Klemda-Club there is to be found On Thursday, 3rd July, 1862, from 5 o'clock in the afternoon, Garden-Music. In case of unfavourable weather, then, on the other hand, at 7i o'clock in the evening, Dance amusement will take place. The Foremost Members. The Erholung-Club.

Moreover, it is usual with each of these clubs to hold one fancy ball in the course of the year ; and although we have known working butchers then pay five thalers for the hire of the costume to enable them to enjoy the small honour of appearing as Francis I. of France, or strutting as Charlemagne for a Jew"], [84, "68 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. hours, individual expenditure on such occasions is no test as to the general folly of a nation. However, we are assured that 2 thalers, or Os. a head, even though the costumes are of the most trumpery description, is but a small estimate of the ex penses consequent on these masquerades ; for every one of the middle classes goes to one or other of the entertainments, and everybody eats, drinks, and dances till nearly six in the morning. On the occasion of the mask ball, at least half a page of the little Eisenach gazette (that is no bigger than a baby's pocket-hand kerchief) is taken up with the staring programme of the prices of admission, and arrangements for procuring tickets \u2014 duly clas sified, with all the pedantry of the German schools, as though it were some profound system of natural philosophy. The following is translated, word for word, from the last of e . h announcements : \u2014 Oi. Sunday, the 22nd of February, 1863, there will be in the Saloon of the \" Erholungs\" Club, A Great Mask Ball held \u2014 Tickets at the undermentioned prices will be given out : (1.) For respectable strangers and non-members at 12\u00a3 groschens (fifteen pence English) by Mr. Eoyaltinman, Louis Habermas ; (2.) For members' sons at 7J groschens (ninepence English) by the Tannermaster Mr. Hermann Fiesinger ; (3.) For members' daughters at 5 groschens (sixpence English) by Mr. C. G. Dobermann ; (4 ) For members and honorary members (who will be admitted free of expense) by the Mastercarpenter, Mr. H. Duphorn. The giving out of the tickets continues only to the 22nd of this month (4 o'clock in the afternoon) ; and then tickets without distinction can only at the doors be paid for at 15 groschens (Is. 6d.) each. Commence at 7j o'clock. To a right-strong participation in this entertainment the public is in vited by The Committee of the \" Erholungs\" Club. In addition to the items above given, we must now set down the cost of attendance at the theatre\u2014 the theatricals lasting for six weeks in the year. True, the prices are about the same as those taken at our own Britannia Saloon, and the entertainment not a tithe so good\u2014 the admission to the dress-circle beinc 7 J gros., or 9d. English ; that to the bodv of the theatre 5 gros"], [85, "69 AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. or Gd. of our money ; and the charge to the cheapest places only 3d. During the performance smoking is not allowed, but drink ing of beer and munching of sausages is carried on, even by the ladies, in the \" first places,\" in a manner that has no parallel but among the cook-maids in the gallery of our \" Victoria.\" The pieces which we saw performed were of the lowest and poorest form of dramatic art ; and even those which were said to have been represented in Berlin, between 100 and 200 nights successively, and to be the works of the best modern German dramatists, were such disjointed farragoes of improbabilities, that the commonest English audience would not have tolerated them even for an hour. Indeed, dramatic construction is utterly un known in Germany, for even Schiller himself has but little of the true faculty of action in his plays, the characters often having to mouth some hundred lines of verse, during which the progressive movement of the story comes to a dead halt. The German genius is essentially of a didactic character, and in all their plays, as in all their stories, they love to prose, till those who look for entertainment and expect to be interested, rather than lectured to, in such works, are compelled to gape at the very pla titudes to which they are doomed to listen. German acting, again, is mere dull sing-song declamation, and actors whom we heard professors declare to have \"organs\" which pierced the heart, were to any person who had seen the leading performers of England and France, but poor elocutionary puppets, lacking entirely that fire of soul and that vivid power of impersonation which belongs to a true Talma or a Kean. Indeed, the best German performers whom we listened to were nothing more than ordinary school-boys reciting a speech at a distribution of prizes. Upon such entertainments the Eisenachers, as a rule, wasted about 15 gros., or Is. Gd., each man during the season, the common custom being for each person to go thrice during the six weeks ; of course, many of the officers and others were there night after night, and some of these informed us that they had subscribed for 5 thalers' worth of tickets at the commencement of the season. Nevertherless, such an outlay was by no means general ; and, so far as we could learn, the estimate we have given above appeared to be a fair average of the money thus spent by the citizens. One class of amusement is peculiar to Germany. The Choral Societies which have sprung up in England of late years are mere imitations of the singing-clubs which prevail throughout the"], [86, "70 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. whole of the Fatherland. In the Thuringian capital alone there were the Sing Verein (literally the \" Singing Union\") the Lieder Eranz (\" Song Circle\"), Lieder Tafel (\" Song Tablet\"), the Manner Chor (\" Men's Choir\"), and the Manner Gesangverein (\" Men's Singing Club\"). Each of these five societies consists of be- tween 100 and 200 members, active as well as passive; so that, as there are only 1249 houses in Eisenach, the reader will readily understand that in such a town almost every grown male belongs to one or other of the singing-clubs. Such societies are almost invariably held at public-houses, or those joint-stock pot- houses which pass by the name of clubs in Eisenach. The sub- scription is mostly 1 thaler 5 gros., or 3s. Gd. the year, and for this the members are entitled to admission to the concerts and balls, which occur every six weeks throughout the twelvemonth. Such entertainments constitute the most agreeable pastimes in every German town, for everyone must admit that this people has the faculty of singing in unison with wonderful precision, taste, and excellence ; and the fine German music is rendered, on such occasions, even by amateurs, in a most masterly manner. Almost every native is able to read music at sight ; indeed, it is the common practice at the schools to teach the scholars to sing from notes, so that the faculty thus early educated, and con- tinually exercised in after life, comes to be one of the most dis- tinctive characters of the people. Wherever you go you are sure to hear some chorus floating in the ah ; in your walks in the woods the sounds are wafted from some neighbouring hill-top ; in the valley some party is assembled at one of the little \" garden- houses,\" and a chorus admirably sung echoes among the neigh- bouring rocks. In the dead of the night you hear the people singing along the streets in a band as they return from the taverns ; or maybe you are aroused from your slumbers by the voices of an entire choir serenading the president of the club at midnight, on his birthday. But if the Germans possess the faculty of singing together in exquisite unison, they assuredly lack the power of singing alone with anything like ordinary merit. We were in the habit of attending many of the concerts given by these choral societies, and certainly never had our ears pierced in so disagreeable a manner as by the wretched execution of the solo performers. Almost every one thinks it necesary to sing either in his throat or through his nose ; and when we first became residents in the town there was a great fuss made about the vocal power of one"], [87, "AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. 71 of the young ladies belonging to the Sing Verein. So highly, in deed, was her musical talent appreciated that, on her marriage, an entertainment was given, in which one of the officers enacted the part of a birdseller, and entering the room with a lot of cages over his shoulder, called upon the bridegroom .to give back to the citizens of Eisenach the nightingale which he was about to deprive them of. This same nightingale, however, we can assure the reader, was but a sorry lark ; and, beside any girl of ordinary vocal merit in an English drawing-room, would have appeared very like a goose. But the Eisenach young ladies are not gene rally instructed in the piano, the custom in Germany being that the gentlemen rather than the ladies should be trained in the study of some instrument. Well, as we have said, there is generally a ball and concert in connection with each of these clubs every six weeks, and on the anniversary of the founding of the institution an extra-grand en tertainment is usually given. At the ordinary dances the gentle men regale themselves with beer and sausages, or may be a so called beef-steak, about as big as the palm of one's hand, while a cup of tea and slice of cake is the usual repast of the ladies. On the \" year's day,\" however, the common practice is for each of the gentlemen to indulge in a bottle of eighteen-penny wine and to feast themselves at supper with a portion of baked goose or hare, as the season may afford \u2014 an enjoyment for which they are in the habit of stinting themselves, or saving-up, as they call it, for many a week before. However, lumping the extraordinary with the ordinary entertainments, and assuming that only 15 gros., or Is. Gd., is spent at each ball every six weeks, we have a gross yearly expense of 4 thalers, or 12s., thus incurred, in addition to the subscription to the club itself. Nor is the long list of the sums devoted by the Germans to the matter of amusements yet completed. Indeed, what with balls at the \" Erholung \" or the \" Klemda \" \u2014 the balls at the different singing-clubs in the town \u2014 balls at the taverns in the city, or the suburbs \u2014 skittle-clubs, and coffee-drinkings, either at Fischbach or the \" Fantasie \" \u2014 card-playing and billiard-playing in the beer-houses, at night \u2014 the women as well as the men were in the habit of passing more evenings outside their houses than within them ; so that a sober, decent Englishman, when he heard the fools complain of the poverty of their people, and knew how much time they gave up to pleasure, and how little to work, could hardly refrain from telling them that the penury was of"], [88, "72 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. their own begetting ; and that so long as the masses of the people (ladies as well as gentlemen) had the habits of beggars and vaga bonds, so long must they remain beggars and vagabonds in the eyes of all civilized Europe. The cheapness of the amusements before enumerated cannot fail to have struck the English reader. It may appear delightful that people can go out into the country and enjoy themselves for twopence-halfpenny, or sixpence a head ; that the expenses of a ball (supper included) should be limited to eighteen pence ; that a night's entertainment at a theatre can be had for sixpence, or at the utmost ninepence of our money ; that billiards and skittles can be played for a penny a game ; and that even card-playing, for money, is limited to the twelfth, or the sixth of a penny, per point. All this appears very primitive and very harmless as we read it item by item, but when we come to sum up the whole of the petty figures, and to bear in mind, as we said before, that the income of a German gentleman is about half that of a journeyman tailor in our own country, the eyes begin to open, and the dullest brain is able to understand why even the better-to-do people in the fatherland are forced to live as hard, and to inhabit hovels almost as comfortless, as our own Irish peasants. However, to return to our sheep, as the French say. With each of these singing-clubs there are still there expenses to be set down. The custom prevails throughout Germany of holding \" choral feasts \" in some one or other of the principal towns, to which the several members of the other societies throughout the country are invited. The railway expenses of the journey are defrayed out of thlTgeneral funds in connection with each of the invited choirs, and every member attending the general singing feast is billeted upon some person in the city where the gathering is held, and where he is boarded and lodged gratuitously. The festivities at these yearly congresses of the several singing clubs generally lasts for six days, and during this time drinking and revelry are carried on to such an extent that one of the most prudent citizens in Eisenach informed us that, as a rule, not less than 14 thalers, or \u00a32 2s., were spent by each man who visited them. One such a trip had cost him not less than IS thalers (\u00a32 14s.), although he had been, he said, extremely sparing; and many he knew had laid out as much as 30 thalers, or \u00a34 10s. in the course of the week, so that he was certain that the sum we have named was a very moderate amount expended on such occa sions. We have here enumerated only one such feast as occurring"], [89, "AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. 73 in the course of the year, so as to avoid excess in the above esti mate. There are, however, usually two or more of these mon strous assemblies held at some distant towns ; and these the Eisenach members of the class convening the congress feel them selves more or less bound to take part in. This summer, for in stance, there has been a great Tourner-fest at Leipzig, where some 20,000 gymnasts came together to tumble in public, the Eisenach Tourn-verein helping to swell the numbers. This cost the Eisenachers who attended it 10 \u2014 15 thalers, or from 30s. to 45s. each. Moreover, during the \" bird-shooting \" this autumn, there is to be a grand Eunstler-fest (artists'-feast) up at the Wart burg, where a large temporary hall is now being erected, and which it is expected will bring some thousands of strangers to the town. On such occasions the festivities generally continue for three or four days, and often run over an entire week, the average expenses being at least 3 thalers, or 9s., a-day for each person ; though, to be on the safe side, we have excluded such extraordi nary gatherings altogether from the foregoing calculation. The Germans, however, specially delight in such gigantic fooleries as 30,000 singers or 20,000 Tourners all performing at once. They love to walk in interminably long processions, with banners flying and a band of music (or even half a hundred drummers) clattering away at their head, after the manner of little boys playing at soldiers in the streets. There is but one other item to be added to the above, and then we have done. In the course of the season it is usual for a travelling musician or conjuror, or puppet-show exhibitor, to visit the town ; or else, perhaps, the director of the music at the church gets up a series of \" symphonic concerts,\" to which the majority of the citizens are in the habit of purchasing tickets. But hardly one such entertainment in Eisenach ever pays its ex penses ; the most profitable during our time was a performance given by a small troupe of hand-bell-ringers from London, who, though they spoke the purest Cockney dialect, were advertised as Highlanders, and who made their appearance dressed up in kilts to the great delight of the German folk, the entertainment being as strange to them as the costume was These .worthies drew crowded rooms for some two or three nights successively, whereas we heard that the director of the symphonic concerts lost some ten or twenty thalers by his speculation. The average price of admission to such entertainments ranges from sixpence to a shilling, the latter being considered an extremely high figure."], [90, "74 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Let us assume, therefore, that every grown male in the town visits only one such entertainment in the year, and pays the low est price \"for his admission, viz. five groschens, and we must still add that amount to the total of a German's unnecessary expenses. But by the time we have come to the end of our account the reader has, doubtlessly, forgotten the beginning. We will, there fore, briefly recapitulate the several items of expenditure, so that he may have them aU presented at one glance to his consideration. Tiis. sjas. \u00a3 s. d.

Ths. 164 10\u00abr\u00a32i 13 0 Now, to understand what proportion this annual unnecessary outlay bears to the general income among the people of the city, we must refer the reader to the extracts, hereafter given, from the printed list of the salaries paid to the highest officials of the town. So far as our experience goes 300 \u2014 400 thalers, or \u00a345 \u2014 \u00a360 a-year, appears to us to be about the usual income of the middle-class people in the Thuringian capital. Such amusements"], [91, "75 AMUSEMENTS OF THE THURINGIANS. as those above-cited are indulged in only by the better-to-do middle class families, and we repeat that \u00a345 to \u00a360 the year is not only a fair sum at which to set such income down, but many of our friends believed the usual amount of middle-class earnings to be much lower than we have stated. At the corner of the Carls Platz, in which we lived, was the shop of a Kaufmann, or chandler, doing more than an ordinary run of business ; and here we knew, for a fact, from the best authority, that the average takings throughout the year amounted to \u00a31 a-day. Assuming, then, the profit to be 25 per cent., the gross weekly gain of such a person would be \u00a31 15s. ; for Sunday, at such a business, is the same as week-days in Eisenach. But out of this weekly sum a shop-boy had to be paid and fed, and lighting and rent provided, and this would cost at least 1 5s. a-week altogether ; so that the clear gains of such a person could not be more than \u00a31, or say 7 dollars the week, which is at the rate of 864 thalers, or \u00a354 12s. the year. True, some other of these chandlers-shopkeepers took more than the one above mentioned ; the receipts of one at the opposite corner of this same Carls Platz, we were informed, amounted to double as much daily ; while the takings of another man, who did the best retail business in the town, were said to be but \u00a34 10s. per diem. We have cited the first-mentioned Kaufmann, however, as being a type of the general body of chandler's-shopkeepers throughout the town ; for though he took less than the few who had the best businesses, his receipts were more than many who had shops in the less- frequented parts of the town. Further, it may be mentioned, that 300 thalers, or \u00a345 a-year, is the income of a lieutenant in the army, so that in estimating each of the citizens, the trades- men, the professional men, Government officials and officers in the army, to have as much as 300 or 400 thalers coming in every year, we are convinced we are not very wide of the truth. How, then, stands the account ? On the one side we have an income of \u00a345 to \u00a360 the year, and on the other an outlay of not less than \u00a324 10s. in wholly unnecessary expenditure ; the larger pro- portion being spent in drinking and gambling, while the magnifi- cent sum of from \u00a320 to \u00a335 is left for keeping house, for feeding and clothing not only the man himself, but the several members of his family. Now, reader, perhaps you will comprehend why so little meat can be afforded in each middle-class German family ; you will understand how it is that but one pound among the whole is the"], [92, "76 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. usual allowance on the Sunday \u2014 potatoes, milk-soups, and barley soups, and hard-boiled eggs, and Swede turnips being the general fare, even in gentlemen's families, on week-days. You can now divine the reason why even the judges have hardly a shirt to their back, and many a person rejoicing in tho long-winded title of Herr Appellations-Gericht Rath is obliged to resort to the dirty sham of \" dickeys.\" You will now be able to see why it is that though white bread is but twopence the pound, none but the rich can afford to eat it, and then only as cake \u2014 the ordinary staff of life in Germany being a disgusting mass of sour, black rye dough, baked till it is the colour of ginger-bread, and as heavy and tooth some as the compound schoolboys are in the habit of denomina ting \"stick -jaw.\" You will now, too, be able to conceive the cause why the rooms of gentlefolks should be as bare of every article of elegance or comfort as an ordinary English tap-room, and why the ladies of the town should be seen bringing home their bundles of straw from the market in order to furnish new beds for the family. Think what it would be if an English gentleman, earning his \u00a3800 a-year, was in the habit of wasting nearly \u00a3150 of it outside of his house. Where would be our boasted home comforts, if the father of every family, and the grown-up sons of every mother, made it an invariable practice to pass every night of the week drinking and playing at cards, skittles, or billiards, in some low tavern ? \u2014 or if the ladies of every English household, on the other hand, thought it essential to visit beer-gardens at least twice or thrice every week, and to be flaunting away at some ball or con cert at least once every fortnight throughout the year ? What would become of our cosy firesides then? and where would be that moral and decent training of the younger members of each family \u2014 far better than all the learning and scholastic acquire ments of the world ; and which, to the pride of every Englishman, is found alone in his own country ?"], [93, "CHAPTER IX. THE SAXON CUISINE. The Thuringians, as a rule, eat do more meat than the cottiers of Ireland \u2014 potatoes, vegetable-soups, and dumplings, constituting the chief food for dinner and supper throughout the country. Nor must it be imagined that we refer here only to the habits of the poorer classes ; on the contrary, we repeat, what we have be fore stated, that the families of the middle-class folk \u2014 such as tradesmen aud master workmen, and, indeed, the wives and children of many of the professional people and Government officials \u2014 live as hard and as scantily as London needlewomen, and the worst-paid portion of journeymen taUors in the British metropolis ; and, we should add, neither are they so well housed, nor their rooms so decently or comfortably fitted. When we first came to the town, it was a positive nine days' marvel among the citizens, as to the quantity of animal food con sumed by our family in the course of the week ; and yet our fare was simple plain English living, without even meat at breakfast or supper. At first it was difficult to understand the astonish ment of our new neighbours ; we soon, however, found that it was the custom even of the better-to-do portion of the community to taste beef or mutton only twice or thrice a week, and that many a Burgher ate it only on the Sundays ; and that, indeed, when ever animal food was partaken of, the \"joint\" consisted of a \" bit,\" not more than a pound in weight, which had to be duly distributed in pieces of an ounce or two each, among the several members of the family. Even a hare, when it is bought as a great treat, is expected to last the several members of the house hold for three days ! though hares cost each but a shilling of our money. Now, though one seldom sees the table arrangements of a"], [94, "78 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Saxon family \u2014 such things as dinner-parties in the houses of the gentry being utterly unknown in the land \u2014 still, you hear from the different servants who come to live with you what are the habits of the people in their private household arrangements ; and we know, from what we ourselves could not help seeing, that the milliners who lived below us, and ranked as the best modistes in the place, had only a scrap of meat, no bigger than the palm of one's hand, on the Sunday, and that to satisfy four grown women and a servant; whilst on the other side, the town coun- cillor, who lived over our head, with his wife, fared about as plainly and closely as does a journeyman carpenter, or working turner on the other side of the Channel ; for the Rath and the Rathin were accustomed to take their dinners in the dingy dismal \" cooking-room,\" as it is called, in a style far less decent and tidy than is customary among the artizans and mechanics of England. Again, we had it from our own domestic, that the family of one of the principal officials in connection with the Government taxes, never ate any animal food, except once a week as a rule\u2014 the week-day meals generally consisting of all kinds of barley- broths and \" flour food,\" and vegetable soups, or may be of potato-dumplings and plums, or coffee and bread-and-butter; while the morning repast was merely a dry roll of bread, and a cup of black coffee, without any milk or sugar added to it. Fur- ther, it was well known throughout the town, that the High Chamberlain of the Grand Duke was wont to have the mid-day repast for himself, wife, and family sent in from the \" Mohren Tavern\" (his lordship having no servant t\u00ab dress the meal at home), and that this was made up of only two small French por- tions of solid food among five people. In fine, when we tell the polite reader that the salary of this same grand ducal functionary was about \u00a360 a year, he will readily understand, not only that no servant could have been maintained out of it, but that no more plentiful fare could have been possible on such a pittance- seeing that the said high chamberlain received merely the wages of a gentleman's coachman in England. Still, it will be remembered that we have spoken of the Eisenachers' great love of pig-feeding ; and, therefore, it may be said, if it be true that these people, as a rule, consume more po tatoes than beef aud mutton, what become of the fat swine that they one and all delight to rear? The capacious vat into which every portion of pig-meat is thrown, as soon as the animal is slaughtered, to be chopped into"], [95, "79 THE SAXON CUISINE. sausages, affords a sufficient solution of the mystery \u2014 especially when the process of family sausage-making has once been wit nessed by the stranger. For the greater mass of the fat of the hog, when duly pared from the flesh, is boiled down into what is called Speck (the said \" speck\" being a dirty-coloured nasty imita tion of our lard), and the entire offal hacked up with the pig-meat itself, and then dried into either liver-sausage, hard-sausage, red sausage, Savoyard sausage, and Heaven knows how many other sausages besides ! True it is, that on the day of the festival on which the pig is slaughtered (and this is a time of special rejoi cing among the friends of the citizens at whose house the inter esting ceremony occurs) strips of the narrower layers of fat from the neck of the animal, together with the ears and snout, are boiled and served up with peppermint Schnapjjs, as great deli cacies, under the name of \" Eessel-fleish\" (pot-meat) for breakfast to those favoured acquaintances who are invited to participate in the boorish banquet. But beyond such parings, hardly one bit of the meat itself ever makes its appearance as a joint of roast or boiled upon the citizens' tables. For the first few months of our residence in the refined palatial capital of Thuringia, we were astonished at the cannibal love of goose-flesh evinced by the community. Day after day, and week after week, at Martinmastide, was this the favourite dish of the folk, so that every house reeked of its baked goose, either at dinner, or supper-time, till educated nostrils got to be nauseated with the not-particularly-delicate odour ; for though the fumes of the dish may be savoury enough for once in a way, they are rather too strong not to pall after a time upon refined olfactory nerves. Indeed, go into whatever Gasthaus you might, or even into any private establishment, you were sure to sniff the hot fuming goose-fat at the above season of the year. In the same manner, then, as the pigs are kept for sausages, rather than pork, the geese are killed and eaten by the score at one particular time of the year, not because the citizens have sud denly acquired daintier notions than having a mass of potatoes thrown into the middle of the uncovered table for dinner or for supper; but because the great mounds of feather-beds which they sleep under (without either a blanket or a sheet besides to cover them) have to be thought of; \u2014 especially as the feathers of the plucked bird itself would cost almost as much as the entire goose does before it is fattened. It was while speaking upon this matter with a lady-resident of the town that she said, with a sigh,"], [96, "80 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. \"Oh! T cannot tell you how much baked goose we are obliged to eat just now, for there are the entire coverlets of our growing young family to be made up ;\" which is about the same thing as if a farmer with us was to say that he and his household must live on mutton for the next month, because his sons wanted anew coat or two to their backs. For though the poor geese in this boorish land are plucked alive twice before being brought to market, they are ultimately killed and devoured mainly for their third crop of goose-down ; so that no sooner does the Martinmas feast set in than you find even the Colonel's wife, and the Lord Chamberlain's wife, and the Grafin This, and the Frau von That, coming back from the market, each with her live goose dangling in her hand ; and you will see the elegant dames, a week or two afterwards, seated in the kitchen, beside the maid-servant, with their head tied up in a cloth, and their dress and face as fluffy as if they had been newly tarred and feathered, engaged in the Arcadian occupation of stripping the dead goose of its highly prized covering. We will, however, now proceed to cite a few extracts from a class of books, which are often as good guides even as Murray, to the curiosities of the land in which we live, viz. the cookery-books of the country. In the lowest form of animal life, the sentient creature is a mere stomach ; and the highest form of animal organism very often remains at that point also. Moreover, can nibalism, which is regarded as the most savage type of human existence, is mainly a gastronomic test as to the refinement of the country in which it prevails ; and the Samoiedes are merely judged by ethnologists to be but a few degress above the carnivora, not only from the inordinate capacities of their stomachs, but from the shocking coarseness of their food. Hence the modes of eating and drinking \u2014 the things on which the people of a country feed, as well as the manner of their feeding, appear to us to be fair enough criteria as to the delicacy and refinement of the race. And we shall, therefore, proceed to apply such a standard to the tastes of the Saxon gentry, by making a few extracts concerning the favourite dishes of the people, from the principal Saxon cookery-book ; and then leave it to the English reader to decide as to how he would like to pass a couple of years upon such fare, or as to how highly he would think of the folk who were continually regaling themselves with it. The work from which we quote is entitled the \" Praktisches"], [97, "81 TBE SAXON CUISINE. Kochbuch\"1 (Practical Cookery-book), for \" ordinary and superior kitchens,\" by Henrietta Davidis, and published only some half dozen years ago. It holds, indeed, about the same rank in Saxon-Germany as the works of Mrs. Glass and Mrs. Rundall do with us, being merely a system of domestic cookery, intended more especially for the households of well-to-do middle-class families. First, under the head of soups, we have the following peculiar, and not very nice-sounding recipes : \u2014 Beer soup, made with beer, eggs, and sugar, which are to be all beaten up together, and then boiled for dinner, whilo the more luxurious are advised to have a few raisins, or some milk mixed with it to make it more palatable \u2014 or nasty, we should say. Then we have a soup made from what boys call \" hips and haws,\" or the berries of the dog-rose growing in the hedges, the rind of which is to be boiled in water with bits of bread, till the latter acquire the consistence of a poul tice, when it is to be rubbed through a sieve, and some sugar, nutmeg, &c, to be added to it; after which, says the book, \"it will be found very soothing to the sick and suffering \" \u2014 though we should fancy rather as an external than internal application. The same work supplies us with a recipe for \"green-corn soup,\" the unripe grain having first to be boiled into a squash, and then forced through a sieve, as per last, till it assumes the appearance of the skimmings of a duck-pond ; when, to make it extra good, a few lumps of white bread and boiled onions are to be mixed with it. Another very choice soup, we are informed, may be made from cows' udder! but for the proper preparation of this elegant dish, it is necessary that the \" milk bag \" should be first boiled in several waters ; and when the boilings have been rejected, and it has become tender and white, the sack is to be cut into small strips, and cooked in butter and flour, until it is of a fine yellow ; after which the epicure can add a little piarsley and nut meg (a nice gastronomic mixture !), and when the entire mess has been served up in a little weak veal broth, we are assured that the \" smack \" of it will be found to be most delicate, for persons of diseased stomachs. After this comes a mess of soups made from \"green meat,\" such as would create a revolution in a poor-house, if ever they were to be served out to the London paupers \u2014 some of them being soup made out of the water in which cabbages have been boiled \u2014 the said green-water being merely thickened with potato flour, and lubricated with lard, while into the resulting toothsome mash, 0"], [98, "82 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. bits of black bread are to be thrown. Other such soups, are to be concocted in a similar way from the water that has been used to cook potato dumplings, and this is to he flavoured and treated after the same refined fashion. Then we have milk soups \u2014 and remember, reader, these are not dishes recommended for the breakfast of children, but the delicacies which are to constitute the solid dinners of grown-up men and women ; and we ourselves knew not one or two, but many of the gentry and trades-folk in Eisenach, whose mid-day meal consisted of nothing else than this same baby-pap. These milk soups the Saxon gentry are advised to make up with oats, or indeed such grain as the horses and cattle are fattened upon in England ; while under the same head we are favoured with the manner of compounding \" butter milk-soup with buck-wheat grain,\" or if this cannot tickle the palate of the enlightened Saxon, he can try the same soup made with oats and dried berries, or else with plums and raisins. After this come the fruit soups, and we know, in our experience while resident in the Eisenach palatial town, of a small revolution which occurred in the household of a family (the mother of whom, au Irish-woman by birth, had married with a decently-to-do Ham burg merchant), when the boys, who had been accustomed to something like solid English fare, were asked to make their mid day meal off cherry-soup and potato dumplings, instead of the substantial viands which had been their usual food. Under this head of fruit soups, by way of a substitute for dinner, we have receipts how to compound the strengthening luxuries of \" apple soup flavoured with aniseed;\" or of \"prune soup thickened with oatmeal.\" \" Now, when we tell the reader once more, that these same soups, whether they be \" beer-soups,\" or \" green-meat soups,\" or \"meal-soups,\" or \"fruit-soups,\" or \"butter-milk soups,\" consti tute the main mid-day diet, not alone of the working class of Saxony, but of many of the gentry, the tradesmen, and the master handicraftsmen who live upon them day after day, knowing but the taste of meat on the Sabbath, he will readily understand the hard life, and the hard times, that the struggling people there must have to endure. Such messes as those before-given, we repeat, constitute the chief, if not the only dishes partaken of at dinner \u2014 for, certainly, three days in the week \u2014 by the majority of respectable families."], [99, "FEEDING THE PIGS. 83 Occasionally, however, another dish, besides the soup, may be added, and this may consist, according to the taste of the parties, either of a dried herring, eaten uncooked, or of a salted one, \"mari nirte,\" as it is called ; that is to say, done up in a raw state with cream, apples, capers, and onions ; and as this constitutes a favou rite dish for breakfast, dinner, or supper, we annex the mode of preparing it \u2014 not becanse we believe the receipt will be found acceptable to any English palate, but in order to let persons of the least refinement see how coarsely the Thuringian folk are in the habit of feeding. We quote from the work of Henrietta Davidis, as before. To prepare a marinirte herring. \u2014 The herring is to be taken out of the brine in which it has been pickled, and then soaked in milk from twelve to twenty-four hours. After which time the entrails are to be removed, and the raw fish cut up into strips, and the pieces laid in an earthen pot with layers of shalots, or small onions, capers, cloves, pepper-corns, lemon-peel, and a few bay leaves \u2014 some add slices of apples. In this state vinegar is to be poured over the whole. Then the raw soft roe of the her ring is to be rubbed through a sieve, and beaten up with salad oil or cream into a thick sauce, when it is to be poured upon the pieces of the fish, onions, capers, apples, &c, and afterwards the whole turned out into a dish for table and to be eaten in its raw state. A special chapter of the Saxon cookery book is devoted to what is called \" potato food \" (Eartoffel-speisen), and it forms by no means an insignificant portion of the volume ; for the \" earth apples,\" which honest out-speaking old Billy Cobbett used to call the \" accursed root \" (because it had contributed so much to the degradation of the labouring population of Europe), constitute the principal fare of the Saxons, even as they do of the poorer Irish to the present day. In some families, potatoes and salt are eaten for breakfast, dinner, and supper, almost every day of the week ; and we have before told how, on our first visit to the bur gomaster of Mohra, we found his worship, the mayoress, and family feasting over a mound of steaming potatoes, that had been rolled out on the bare breakfast table, and which they were, one and all, busily engaged in peeling and devouring with their fingers, Nor is it at all uncommon, at the present day, to find entire books advertised in the German papers, as being devoted to the all important subject of the \" Potato Kitchen,\" or, in other words, the thousand-and-one ways of cooking that vegetable."], [100, "84 G REMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. In the work of Henrietta Davidis receipts are given for com pounding the following unsavoury-sounding dishes out of potatoes. For example, potatoes and herrings; sour potatoes ; potatoes with apples ; potatoes with pears ; potatoes with ripe plums ; potatoes with dried plums, &c, Sec. As a specimen of the kind of messes that the above-mentioned dishes are likely to consist of, we will again favour the reader with the mode of compounding one of the most favourite. To prepare potatoes with ripe plums. \u2014 One cooks some potatoes, says the book, in a little butter or fat, and a pinch or two of salt, until they are done. Then one adds as many well-washed plums as there are potatoes, so that the latter shall acquire, what the lady terms, an agreeable sour flavour (dass die Kartoffeln eine an genehme Saure erhalten). Let the whole cook until soft, and then stir the potatoes well up with the plums. Next comes a scanty list of \" wann and cold puddings,\" which are to be made of greis-meal (literally, Embden-groats), rice-meal, potato-meal, black bread, or starch, and each to be eaten with a sauce of mashed fruit ; and concluding with the following elegant compound. To make a rich pudding of craw fish. \u2014 One and a half pounds of stale white bread, three-quarters of a pint of milk, three ounces of the soft part from the heads of some craw-fish, ten fresh eggs, four ounces of powdered sugar, half an ounce of bitter macaroons, or the rind of a lemon, seven ounces of finely-chopped kidney-fat, and the tails of as many hsh as possible cut into small pieces, are to be mixed in the following manner : The crust is to be cut off the white bread, and the crumb soaked in the milk ; then the soft part of the head of the fish is to be rubbed till smooth, after which the yolks of the eggs are to be gradually added ; and when this is finished, the sugar, the macaroons, and the kidney-fat, and the chopped pieces of the tails, are to be stirred up with the above. Lastly, the whites of the eggs are to be beaten to a thick froth, and poured over the whole, and the pudding is to be baked two-and-a-half hours. When cooked, it is to be served with a sauce, made up of the soft part of the craw -fish, with cream or milk, and yolk of egg \u2014 all boiled together ! ! ! Before quitting this part of the subject, however, we should, again, impress upon the reader that even such simple delicacies as potato-meal, Embden-groats, and starch-puddings are seldom or never partaken of after a substantial dinner, but that they, in most cases, constitute the entire mid-day fare ; it being the rule,"], [101, "85 THE SAXON CUISINE. we repeat, with the commoner Eisenach citizens to eat meat (with the exception of a bit of sausage, maybe, for supper during the week) only on the Sunday. But a few days ago our son was invited to stay to dinner with a middle-class family, when the entire fare consisted of pancakes as thick as buckskin, accompanied with a sauce of wild bilberries. Many of the shopkeepers, moreover, we knew often partook merely of unsweetened black coffee and sweetened white bread for their dinner ; while the female members of our family, when pressed to stop and dine with the wife and daughters of one of the principal Government officers of the town, have found the repast to consist merely of prune-soup and potato dumplings ; and on other occasions of white-bread pudding and mashed plums. But, to let English folk see what is the usual fare of the burghers in the capital of Thuringia, we have thought it better to obtain from one of them a definite statement as to what the dinners of an ordinary middle-class family hare consisted of for the last seven days. The person who supplied us with- such par ticulars was one of the principal master-bakers doing as good a business as any in the town ; aud we are satisfied, from our own observations, that the week's bill of fare below-given is a fair sample of the character of the mid-day meals generally partaken of by the Eisenach middle-classes ; such as master-tradesmen, chandlers-shopkeepers, schoolmasters, and Government officials. Sonday. Three-quarters of a pound of hacked meat, baked with plenty of stuffing \u2014 among eight people ! \u2014 with cherry-cake, made out of black bread, to follow. Monday. Boiled French beans, thickened with fat and flour. Tuesday. The remains of the beans and fat re-warmed. Wednesday. \" Dumpling soup,\" i. e. with shreds of a stiff paste boiled in it. Thursday. The remains of the said dumpling soup re-warmed. Friday. \u2014 Boiled potatoes and raw herring. Saturday. Boiled potatoes, and burnt-carrot coffee without either milk or sugar. It would be tedious to enter into further particulars concerning the diet of a nation whose cookery has been introduced into no civilized country that we are aware of. For while diners a la Russe, French dishes, English beefsteaks and roast-beef, Italian confectionery and even Indian curries, sauces, and preserves, have become known over the greater part of Europe, we are not aware"], [102, "86 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of a single German dish that has been found acceptable to any refined foreign palate ; and when we finish our analysis of the Saxon cookery-book, by enumerating merely the titles of the dishes which constitute the more solid fare of those who can afford to put a bit of meat on their table, the English reader will readily understand how such farragoes could never be grateful to any but the coarse palate of an underfed German. How would the reader like, for instance, to taste \" beef baked in sour milk,\" or \"soup-meat with apples and raisins,\" or \"cro- quettes of cow's udder,\" or \"sausages fried in beer,'' or \"veal aud prunes,\" or \" meat with treacle-sauce,\" or \"liver dumplings,\" or \"steaks with a sauce of mashed gingerbread,\" or \"cutlets served with slices of oranges,\" or pork with bread, eggs, cream, onions, and cherries, all baked together \u2014 a mess that goes by the name of \" cherry tablefood \u2014 \" or \" sausage-soup \" made out of pigs' chitterlings, or, lastly, to try the flavour of a compote of \" slugs and sugar-candy \" (a dish which is not only highly re commended for, but often administered to, invalids with weak stomachs), or to eat some \" rolls dipped in bullock's blood and then baked ; \" or, if you are fond of confectionery, what say you to an \" onion cake, with apples,\" or to \" a bacon and parsley cake, with cream,\" or to an \" oil cake,\" the latter being made of the dough of black bread, mixed with beech-nut oil \u2014 for the due pre paration of which filthy compounds, and many others of a like nauseous character, receipts are to be found in the small culinary cyclop\u00e6dia before referred to ?"], [103, "CHAPTER X. DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE MODERN SAXONS. Formerly the estimate as to the proportion which the rent should bear to the gross income of a well-to-do Englishman was that, to be decently housed, it should constitute one-tenth part of the entire earnings. Many believe now-a-days that owing to the general desire which exists among our countrymen for superior house accommodation, the ratio has considerably increased, and that at present it reaches as high as an eighth, or a sixth of the yearly profits \u2014 people with \u00a3'500 per annum mostly renting houses from \u00a370 to \u00a380 the year. In the Thuringian capital it is difficult to calculate what part of the earnings of the people are devoted to the matter of rent ; but, from a calculation we instituted, it would appear that, in most cases, it does not form one-fifteenth part of the entire in come. Post-office \" secretaries\" or clerks, getting about 300 thalers per annum, usually pay 24 thalers a-year, or 6s. a month, for their lodgings \u2014 and this is rather less that one-twelfth part of the income. Government clerks, again, who receive 12 thalers a month, generally pay 1 thaler for their sleeping-room. Among the wealthier classes, however, it is customany for each person, who has the means to do so, to purchase the freehold of the house in which he lives, and to let out every floor of it but the one he himself selects to occupy \u2014 the tenants of such floors, of course, paying more in proportion for their lodgings than the wealthier part of the community : even as a clerk with us, who earns but a pound or thirty shillings a-week, is generally compelled, if married, to give up a fourth, and sometimes as much as a third, of his gains for the rooms or the little house which he occupies in the suburbs. An artizan, again, in England, who receives 36s. wages every week, mostly stands at about 5s. weekly for rent : so"], [104, "88 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. that it would appear, from the comparisons we have instituted between the different classes of the two countries, that the pro portion which an Englishman expends for housing is considerably greater than in Germany. Indeed, it is but natural that it should be so, seeing that Ger mans care less about having a decent home over their head than \" proud Britons\" (as the Saxons call us) are prone to do. Bent, of course, is less expensive here than in our own country. We, for a first-floor, consisting of eleven rooms, in one of the largest houses in the town, pay \u00a322 tbe year unfurnished, and at the early part of our residence in Eisenach we gave for a large fur nished villa \u00a358 per annum. But then the Saxon people earning less, must naturally have less to pay, so that we can only be guided by the proportionate part of the income set aside for such matters by the people of different countries. The usual price given for a furnished bed-chamber and small sitting-room in Eisenach is about 6s. the month, and about 3s. a month unfur nished ; while the value of large houses in the principal streets, when sold, ranges from 5000 to 10,000 thalers (\u00a3750 \u2014 \u00a31 500). House property, however, is never expected to return more than five per cent, interest on the capital, so that the entire rent of such domiciles, if they could be hired, would be from \u00a337 10s. to \u00a375 per annum. The Eisenach houses at best are but large, ill-arranged home steads, built of a net-work of timbers, with the interstices filled up either with mud and wicker-work, or else with unbaked mud bricks, and the walls, inside and out, rudely plastered over. In deed, this is the approved mode of building throughout the town, for there were but two brick edifices \u2014 aud they were new public institutions \u2014 in the entire town ; the Grand Duke's palace itself being nothing more than the same elegant \" wattle-and-dab ' order of structure. Thus much for the matter of rent ; and now to estimate the cost of the drinking expenses of the same people. So far as our experience goes, the proportion that an English artizan, of decent temperate habits, devotes to such matters, ranges from an eighth to a sixth part of his entire weekly wages ; that is to say, a good workman earning, on an average 30s. a week, spends between 3s. &d. and 5s. upon porter and tobacco in the course of the seven days. We have purposely fixed the amount, here given, at a higher figure than is common among the more respectable arti zans of the British metropolis; judging, however from the account-"], [105, "89 DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE MODERN SAXONS. books of their household expenses furnished us by the better-to- do of the London workmen while we were prosecuting our inqui- ries among the poor of the British capital some years ago, we are satisfied that 3s. 6rf. a week would well cover the weekly drinking expenses of the more decent portion of our labouring population. But then it is unfair to draw an average from this same more decent section of the class ; so that, all things considered, we be- lieve that the estimate we have given of from 3s. 6eZ. to 5s. well represents the cost of the weekly sum spent in public-houses by the generality of the ieffcr-paid workmen of England. It should be borne in mind, then, that the average drinking expenses of the hard-working portion of our nation vary, as a rule, from between an eighth to a sixth part of the entire weekly gains ; and we believe that the same calculation would hold good even among the commonest earth-workers throughout the country ; for Is. in every 6s. is, so far as our experience goes, an extreme amount of money for a working man to expend in beer, and Is. in every 12s. a very moderate sum to be expended upon the same luxury. Of course the exceptional hard-drinkers and reckless sots, who prevail in every land, are excluded from the calculation. We are here speaking only of the general practice ; and when it is remembered that out of the sum left, after paying for beer, rent has to be discharged, and food and clothing procured \u2014 not only for the man himself, but in most cases for his wife and family \u2014 it will be understood, that, as a general rule, it would be impos- sible for a mechanic to devote more than a sixth of his income to drink, and still maintain the decent home, which those who know the workmen as well as we do, will be ready to acknowledge is their general custom. Let us see, on the other hand, how much the Germans, on an average, consume out of their yearly incomes in the matter of beer alone. We remember talking with an English clergyman who was lamenting the dissipation aud degradation of the poorer classes in the district in which it was his duty to minister, because he had discovered that there was one public-house to every five hundred souls in his parish. Let this ratio, then, be taken as the standard of extreme intemperance throughout the worst parts of our own country ; and with such test firmly fixed in the mind, let us proceed to note how the same matter stands in Saxony. Well, the Thuringian capital is by no means remarkable in Germany for the hard-drinking habits of its citizens. As a"], [106, "90 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. German town, it may be fairly taken as an average of all others in this respect ; a drunken man is seldom or never seen in the streets, and the public-houses are bound to close \u2014 though few of them do so, by the bye \u2014 at 11 o'clock on every night of the week. This town has a populationof not quite 14,000 souls, and for the supply of beer, Ac, to the entire community there are no less than forty taverns within the city bounds, and some half-dozen more situate in the immediate neighbourhood of it \u2014 the landlords of the latter also deriving their profits chiefly from the citizens of Eisenach. However, rejecting the suburban \" beer gardens\" from the calculation, we find that forty taverns to 14,000 inhabi tants is in the proportion of one such hostelry to every 350 souls of the population, which shows a state of things very nearly 50 per cent, worse than in the worst parts of our own country. Still, it may be urged that the number of beer-houses after all afford but a slight criterion as to the quantity of beer consumed by the community, since one large tavern may draw double the amount of beer compared with ten small ones ; and in order to come at the truth of the matter, we consulted a gentleman in connection with one of the chief breweries of the city, so as to learn from him exactly the quantity of beer which was consumed within the town in the course of the twelvemonth. The facts furnished to us on this occasion were as follows : \u2014 In the course of each year there are usually 7000 Eimern, of about twenty gallons each (or 140,000 gallons of beer in alii, brewed at the Rock brewery ; and 4000 such Eimern, or 80,000 gallons, produced at the \" Palace brewery.\" Of these, 500 Eimern are exported, making altogether a total of 10,500 Eimern consumed in Eisenach. Over and above this, there are 12,000 more casks of beer (each of twenty gallons capacitv) imported into the town ; and thus we have a gross total of 22,500 such Eimern or 450,000 gallons of beer drunk by the little community of Eisenach in the course of the twelvemonth. This amount divided by the 14,000 inhabitants, gives very nearly thirty-two and a quarter gallons as the quantity of beer consumed by every man, woman, and child in the town in the course of the twelve month. Then excluding one-half of the entire population as females, and half again of the remainder as being too old or too young to attend the beer-houses nightly, we have a grown popu lation of 3500 individuals, each of whom must consume 129 gallons of beer throughout the year, or not quite two and a half gallons a-week !"], [107, "91 DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE SAXONS. This estimate, of course, is for the entire grown male popu= lation. The working classes of the country, however, are too badly paid to be able to afford even the luxury of a penny glass of beer after their day's labour. The usual liquor consumed by labouring men during their work is Schnapps \u2014 potato spirit ; and of this the custom is for each man to drink a quarter of a pint during the day, the pint costing not quite four-pence of our money. How much may be taken after the hours of labour we are not in a position to state. If, then, we exclude from the entire 3500 persons, constituting the able-bodied male population of Eisenach, one-half of the number as appertaining to the working classes (and in the generality of communities the pro- letarian tribe amount to not less than three-fourths of the grown male population) as being too poor to afford to drink beer in large quantities, we shall find that each well-to-do member of the Thuringian capital consumes hardly less than five gallons of malt liquor weekly \u2014 or nearly six pints every day throughout the year ! Now, to prove that this is no exaggerated statement, it may be mentioned that we ourselves knew a young German student at the Gymnasium, who, though not twenty years old, could drink his twenty pint-glasses of malt liquor at one sitting ; and the gentleman who supplied us with the above information told us that he was acquainted with several persons in the town who were in the habit of drinking on \"highdays and holidays\" not less than twenty-four double glasses of beer, or as much as six gallons in the course of one day ! Moreover, one of our friends, who was a clerk in the Post Office, assured us that he himself had consumed thirty-two pint-glasses (which are equal to four gallons English) during one holiday. The gentleman to whom we are indebted for the above facts, told us it would be perfectly fair to estimate the price of each pint-glass of beer sold in the town (taking the cost of that which is imported with that which is brewed in the city) at one penny farthing English the pint ; for, though the town-brewed beer is sold at a penny the pint, that brought in, from outside the gates is more expensive ; and moreover the landlords know well how, by foaming the cheaper commodity well up at the top of the glass, to get more than four pints out of the ordinary half-gallon can. Now, at a penny farthing the pint-glass, the gallon of beer must cost lOd, and 450,000 gallons at this price would require no less a sum than 18,750Z. to meet the expense of it. This has to be shared among the 3,500 people constituting the entire able-"], [108, "92 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. bodied population of the town, and thus shows an expenditure of ol. 7s. and some odd pence by each individual, for the mere matter of beer alone, during the year. Or if we reject one-half of the able-bodied people as being too poor to frequent the beer houses of an evening, and as drinking Schnapps as a less expensive article than malt liquor, we have the sum of 101. 14s. as the yearly outlay for beer among the heads of the well-to-do families in the city of Eisenach ; and this is at the rate of a fraction more than is. a-week, devoted to this one form of indulgence. To comprehend this part of the social problem English people should first have some sense as to what are really the annual gains of the official and professional people in Eisenach. We have before said that the Lord Chamberlain of the Grand Duke receives but 60?. a-year for his services, the family living in an attic, and the Lady Chamberlain, owing to their inability to keep a servant, being forced to scrub the floors of the rooms his Lord ship inhabits. Nor will it be readily believed that the fee for the first physicians of the town, if consulted at their own houses, is but threepence English, and that if they visit any patient in the city they are entitled to receive the liberal reward of sixpence \u2014 a journey into the country being paid with the handsome sum of three shillings per hour; and, moreover, that an attorney gets but 2d. for writing a letter for his clients, and Is. for a consultation. But it is better to let the official documents of the town itself speak as to the highest salaries given to the Government officers. Every year a printed list of the expenses of the city is sent round to the different inhabitants of Eisenach ; and we, as Schutz biirger, were in the habit of receiving one of these. It is from such an official document that the following statements, as to the salaries given to the chief town-officers, are taken. Per Annum. \u00a3 *. d.

Now, it will be seen by the above accounts that the highest salary paid to any of the city functionaries is that given to the mayor, who receives altogether (in consideration of his acting in the capacity of chief magistrate likewise) \u00a3150; and for this handsome income it should be added, that his worship is expected to belong to no business. Indeed the present burgomaster had to give up the little chandler's shop he kept in Weimar, on being elected for life to the office. We should state, moreover, that the \" Third Burgomaster \" receives only (with perquisites) \u00a345 the year, or not quite 17s. the week, with free lodging for his services ; the said Official's income being, consequently, less than that of an English gentleman's coachman, who has always his rooms \u2014 and rooms which might well compare with the chambers assigned to the Herr Puiths-Assessor into the bargain. Nor will it hardly be credited that the President of the Assizes,"], [110, "94 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. who in this little community is as important an officer as the Lord Chief Justice with us, receives not so much as the wages of a working engineer in London, or but \u00a32 1 Os. weekly ! A working engineer, who ranks in every country as among the highest of skilled labourers, is in the habit of being paid three dollars, or 9s. a-week, and out of this he has to keep himself and family. With us the usual wages for such handicraftsmen are as many pounds the week as dollars are given to the Saxon mechanic. A good carpenter, in Eisenach, gets Is. Gd. a-day, and an ordinary one a penny less \u2014 and both without board or lodging. In the generality of trades, however, the custom prevails of housing and feeding the workmen, rather than giving them wages sufficient to find themselves. A working cabinet-maker receives 3s. a-week for his labour, provided he lives in the house of the master ; but if no such accommodation can be afforded him, he is paid 7s. Gd. a-week \u2014 the keep of a workman in almost all trades being esti mated at 4s. Gd. weekly. The London working cabinet-makers get, in \" good shops,\" as much as \u00a31 16s. weekly wages ; and we are here speaking only of the sums paid to journeymen by the best Eisenach tradesmen. A mason receives the same price as a cabinet-maker; a journeyman tailor, on the other hand, has only 2s. Gd. a-week wages, to which 4s. dd. are added if he lives out of tbe house \u2014 the wages of a good journeyman tailor in London, however, are Gd. an hour, or 36s. weekly. A working blacksmith, who is always kept by his master, receives 2s. Gd. a-week like the tailor, and the hours of labour are expected to range from four in the morning till seven at night. A journeyman tinman, on the other hand, gets 3*. a-week with his board and lodging, which, as we said before, may be estimated at 4s. Gd. extra. Such, then, are the usual weekly incomes of the skilled work men of Eisenach ; the rate of pay ranging from 9s. given as wages to the highest handicraftsman, down to 7s. paid to the low est. With unskilled labourers, however, the rate of pay is but a shade less, since an earth-worker generally receives (when well paid) Is. a-day, or 6s. a-week, out of which he has to supply all the necessaries of himself and family. As regards servants' wages, \u00a32 14s. the year is considered ex tremely high pay; the average sum being but \u00a31 16s.

Now, from this plain unvarnished tale, as to the ordinary earnings of the best paid and the worst paid people of the town in which we have been resident the last three years, the unpre judiced reader will readily bear us out that in fixing the average earnings of the community at two-and-a-half dollars, or 7s. Gd. a-week, we are rather over-stating than undervaluing the general incomes of the heads of families throughout the town ; and to be assured of this, the reader must remember that the whole of the town officials, taken one with the other (mayors, professors, judges, registrars, servants, &c), get but little more than 9s. a-week. What the tradesmen are in the habit of making, it is, of course, difficult to say, but when we add that the principal merchants were chandlers-shopkeepers \u2014 that the chief banker was merely a small money-changer \u2014 that the apothecaries' dealings consisted mostly of a half-penny worth of \" breast powder,\" or a farthing's worth of \" bitter salts,\" or the same quantity of hair oil or pepper mint drops \u2014 and that the palace jeweller thought it worth his while to discontinue his business as a goldsmith, and to turn his little shop into a beer-house instead, Englishmen will readily understand what was the trade and commerce of the town, and how large the incomes of such tradespeople are likely to be. And now let us revert to the previous question, and see what proportion of this income is expended in the matter of beer alone. It has been before shown that in England the average cost of the beer consumed by the working classes \u2014 for they are the principal beer-drinkers with us \u2014 amounts to between a sixth and an eighth part of the entire earnings of the labouring community ; and we have also represented, by details supplied us by one of the best"], [112, "96 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. authorities in connection with such a matter, that the amount of beer consumed by the grown people of Eisenach amounts to no less than two-and-a-half gallons for every adult male the week ; and that if we exclude the labouring population who generally in dulge in Schnapps, the quantity consumed by each male indi vidual rises to not less than five gallons; so that at \\Qd. the gallon, the sum expended upon malt liquor fluctuates between 2s. Gd. and 5s. for each individual in the course of the seven days, according as we include in the estimate either the whole adult male community, or exclude the schnapps-drinking labourers from the community. If then, we assume the incomes of the better-to-do classes, who constitute the principal beer-drinkers in the city, at three dollars odd, or 10s. a-week, we shall find that even, upon this liberal estimate, one-half of the earnings is spent in beer alone; whereas, if we embrace the entire adult male population in the calculation, the result, even then, would be that as much as 2s. Gd. out of 7s. 6rf. is lavished upon drink, or, in other words, one-third of the gross gains of the entire people. Hence we have an explanation of the miserable, unsubstantial food upon which families have to exist, for thus we get to under stand why meat, though it be but 2^d. a pound, is a luxury that the well- to-do can afford to enjoy only on the Sunday ; and why potato- messes, and milk soups, and green-meat soups, and rotten cabbages, with dried herrings, and barley broth, and burnt-carrot coffee, and black bread, and hard boiled eggs, make up the articles usually partaken of by the citizens, the Government officials, and the professional gentry of the town. What wonder, too, that scarcely a gentleman, in the town can afford a shirt to his back ! since the washing of such articles is too expensive to admit of his drinking his usual quantity of beer; and we can vouch that the Herr Appellations- Rath Kranky, who occupied the attic over our head, had not a single shirt in his entire wardrobe, for over and over again have we seen the Rath's entire wash spread upon the grass plot which constituted the joint-stock garden of the several lodgers, and nothing but \"dickeys\" were to be found among it. What wonder, either, that the young children even of post-office clerks, are obliged to be left to crawl about the floor without even a shoe or stocking to their feet, and with nothing but a dirty flannel petticoat to their back ! Or, in fine, that every household of the Eisenach middle-classes exhibits the same squalor as, and that the families of the gentry should live little better thau, the Irish peasantry of our own empire !"], [113, "97 DRINKING CUSTOMS AMONG THE SAXONS. We will now conclude this chapter with a description of tbe time spent in beer-houses by the more respectable of the Eisenach community. At ten o'clock in the morning it is the rule with the tradesmen, and others, to drop into the taverns for the enjoyment of the meal which is equivalent to the dSjeuner a la fourchette in France, but which, in Germany, generally consists of a piece of sausage and black bread (eaten by means of a clasp-knife without any fork at all), and washed down by a glass of beer. In this manner half an hour of the earlier part of the day is generals consumed \u2014 the principal master-cabinet-makers, watchmakers, chandlers' -shopkeepers, and others, conforming to the practice. Then, after the mid-day meal has been partaken of among the members of their several families, it is the custom with the afore said citizens to spend another hour in the beer-house, and there to drink, at least, one other glass of beer. At four o'clock all the Government offices close, and this is the hour for indulging in another repast. Accordingly, the people flock in greater, or less numbers, for a longer or shorter period, to regale themselves with a third glass of beer. Then, again, the taverns are once more deserted until seven o'clock ; after which every one of the forty taverns becomes filled to overflowing with the crowd of guests boozing within it, and there they remain sitting and smoking till eleven at night. This, so far from being an extraordinary prac tice, is the rule, be it remembered, with ever}- father of a family, and grown man, who can afford the luxury of drinking beer in the town. We took some pains to ascertain what was the average quantity of beer drunk by each of the guests at each of the forty beer-houses in the course of each night in Eisenach, and we were assured that three pints to every person was an extremely fan calculation. Now add this to the three other glasses drunk in the course of the day, and the result is the same as before stated \u2014 that five gallons the week is the average amount of malt liquor consumed by each of the frequenters of the taverns in the Thuringian capital. Nor, as we said before, is this the only social evil attendant upon such practices. The Legislature of England has very wisely prohibited the custom of gambling in beer-houses, but in Eisenach the governors of the city see no harm in such indulgences ; and accordingly card-playing for money prevails in almost every ta vern until midnight. It is true the stakes played for are less than a farthing, still many a groschen exchanges hands upon such occasions, and the people thus get to expect to make up by games 7"], [114, "98 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of chance the gains which they would otherwise only look for from honest industry. Indeed, throughout the whole of Eisenach there was so deep-rooted a notion of acquiring large sums of money through luck that there was hardly a person who did not invest his \" thaler \" odd in every lottery as fast as it came round ; and many of the merchants and mechanics were in the habit of saving up, in order to be able to make an excursion over to Gotha during the \" bird-shooting \" and to play at the \" roulette table.\" We have but to deal with another part of this subject, and then we have done. A popular opinion exists in England, that though the Germans are a beer-drinking race they indulge but little in spirituous liquors ; and we remember an enlightened Glasgow publisher, who was connected with one of the temperance societies of that city, telling us, on his return from a tour through Germany, that he had never been so delighted in all his life as he was to see several thousands of Germans assembled under one roof, lis tening to the grandest music, and each regaling themselves with merely a glass or two of beer. We happened, however, to have passed several years of our life among these same people, and to have acquired a knowledge of their habits far better than he pos sibly could obtain, after a fortnight's scamper through the country. AVe asked him if he was aware that the statistics of nations proved that every German \u2014 man, woman, and child \u2014 notwithstanding the prevalence of beer-houses, drink three gallons of spirits in the course of the year, whilst the average quantity consumed by each individual in England is ouly three quarts. These statistics are derived from M'Culloch, who tells us in his \" Geographical Dic tionary \" that the annual consumption of spirits throughout Prussia amounts to between forty and forty-five millions of English gal lons ; whereas the entire quantity of spirits entered for home consumption in the United Kingdom is, on the average, only from twenty-five to twenty -six million gallons ; aud this though the population of Great Britain and Ireland is nearly double that of Prussia. Hence, dividing the quantity consumed by the number of people in each country, it follows that every one of the Prussian people consumes not less than four times more ardent S2nrits, in the course of the year, than our own countrymen ! (M'Culloch's Geogr. Diet., art. \"Prussia.\")"], [115, "CHAPTER XL THE SAXON SERVANTS. In Saxony, where the Government or police meddle in everything with which they have no moral or political right to interfere, ser vitude, instead of being a social institution, is there placed under the special superintendence of the Polizei \u2014 every servant in the country being as much under the police as though he, or she, were a convict with a ticket-of-leave in England. Such things as verbal characters are utterly unknown in the land. The usual mode is for the maid, when she enters your service, to bring her Dienst-buch, as it is called, with her ; in which are written a few lines of useless recommendation from each of the masters or mis tresses with whom she had previously lived, all duly certified by the official seal of the authorities of the town. This Dienst-bueh is then given into your possession, where it remains until such time as you have reason to part with the girl ; and then you are expected, if not bound, to write in it the same tarradiddles con cerning the maid's good conduct, her honesty and sobriety, as her other masters and mistresses have done before you. For, no matter how badly behaved the girl might have been, no one is disposed to deprive the poor drudge of her living by penning the literal truth ; and therefore all go on scribbling white lies syste matically, one after the other, and upholding a practice which is as silly as it is useless, and which even the wiseacres at the head of the Government ought long ago to have found out that the girls themselves are continually in the habit of evading. For it is the custom with the servants, whenever anything may be written in their book that they are not particularly anxious to submit to every eye, to retire to their native place, some miles distant in the country, on the plea of the illness of some relative ; and, after absenting themselves for several months from the town, to return"], [116, "100 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. without their Dienst-buch, which they profess to have lost, and thus to start in life again with a bran-new volume and an utterly unblemished character. However, that the English reader may have a thorough notion of the atrocities still upheld by the dunderhead officials of Saxony, we will lay before him a literal translation of the police regula tions prefixed to the \" service-book \" which every maid- and man servant is expected to have in his or her possession. I. Chief Duties of Servants. \" The servant has to pay attention and show respect to its master and mistress ; to submit to all household arrangements, and attend to all instructions and orders without contradiction ; is not to leave the house without the permission of its master, and to return at the appointed time. Above all, it has to keep a sober and respectable appearance. Rebukes (even if not merited) it must receive with humility. (Let us here, by way of parenthesis, draw attention to the brutal mode in which the servant is officially spoken of \u2014 the term it being applied by us only to dogs and other animals. High minded Germans, however, like to say \" Will es nicht grussen ? \" (Will it not salute) \u2014 a form of speech used by officers and ser geants to private soldiers omitting to touch their caps to them.) \" The work which is given by its master or mistress to the servant to be performed, but which must accord with the strength of the servant, must be executed at any hour of the day or night; and the servant may not without its master's consent, avail itself of any other person to assist in it. \" The servant has to consider the welfare and advantage of its master and mistress, and so far as lies in its power to protect them against injury. By thoughtless or negligent disregard of this duty, the servant is liable to be punished with fourteen days' imprison ment! \" The contract undertaken by the master is broken by the servant doing any of the subjoined things : \u2014 \" (1.) By taking away any money or articles whatever, let their value be great or small. \" (2.) By dishonesty and cheating ; as for example, if the servant makes use of part, or the whole, of any money entrusted to it; if it gets goods in the name or upon the credit of its master; or if it sets down the prices of things at a higher sum than they"], [117, "SAXON SERVANTS. 101 really cost, and so forth. Faults of this character can be pun ished according to the criminal laws of the country. \"By pilfering, or withholding drink-money which ought to have been divided among its fellow servants : by purloining the fodder given out to it for the cattle ; all of which offences may be punished with twelve days' imprisonment. \" If the master suspect the servant of dishonesty, he may have its things and boxes searched, or the master may search them himself ; but the latter can only be done in the presence of the servant. Should the master, however, accuse the servant of dis honesty, without just cause, the servant has no right to recover compensation for the wrong ! \"(3.) By any injury to the master, by deeds or words ; such as scandal, or talking openly of the faults or secrets of the master, or speaking of anything that goes on in the house, or by inducing its fellow-servants to do the like. \" x\\ll breaches of duty in this respect, whether by words or deeds, provided they are not of a very serious character, are pun ishable with imprisonment for fourteen days ! \"Moderate chastisement, and reprimand, caused by the im proper behaviour of the servant, are not to be considered as any wrong done to it, and give the servant no right to obtain a summons against its master for redress; excepting it should so happen, that in the course of the reprimand the servant has been accused of thieving, or of doing anything else which it could prove to be untrue. \" If the servant has any just cause of complaint against its master, then can it go before a magistrate ; but in no case is absconding permissible. \" A servant who absconds from its master can be forced, at its master's desire, to return to its servitude, and must, if the master so wishes, serve its time out ; but if, on the other hand, it has valid reasons for wishing to leave, such as are given here under the proper head, it need serve only to the end of the quarter, or if hired by the month, to the month's end. Otherwise it can, according to the circumstances, be punished with three days' im prisonment upon bread and water. \" The master is justified in refusing to take back a servant who has once absconded ; and in such a case, he need not pay either its board or wages after the day upon which the absconding occurred."], [118, "102 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. II. Chief Rules Concerning the Making and Can celling of the Agreements entered into at the Time of Hiring. \" Only those who have free control over their income, or at least a part of it, may take a servant. In case of doubt, the master or mistress must prove that he is able to support such an attendant, and that he will not convert service into a mere matter of show and parade.\" (How funny and childish all this useless meddling sounds to English ears !j \" Whoever wishes to go out to service, must have free control over themselves. Children under the guardianship of their parents, or other persons duly appointed, cannot enter service without the consent of such parties. Wives cannot go out to service without the permission of their husbands, nor persons filling some public office without the consent of their superiors. \" Every hiring contract which infringes these rules is not valid. \" If soldiers have gone into private service during their fur lough, then the military service puts on one side the obligations of the private contract. \" The hiring is perfected by the declared consent of both parties ; and to perfect it there is no need of any written agree ment or hiring-money. But where hiring-money has been specially agreed upon, then the validity of the contract is contin gent upon the payment of such money. \" Every person who wishes to enter service within the Grand Duchy, or without it, must \u2014 with the exception of tutors, secre taries, companions, and the hke (Wirthschqft-beamten), learned foresters, scientific gardeners, and persons of the same kind \u2014 provide themselves with a service-book. \" It is not until such a service-book has been deposited in the hands of the master that the hiring contract is complete. \" Whoever keeps a servant longer than fourteen days in his employment without such a book, is liable to one thaler fine ; and if at the expiration of this time, the servant is not sent away, the master is responsible for the penalties consequent upon such a breach of the law ! With the consent of the proper authorities, the time of waiting for the service-book may be lengthened from a fortnight to a month. \" On entering service, and at every time of changing places,"], [119, "103 SAXON SERVANTS. the servant must obtain a written character from its last master which is to be duly certified by the police authorities, provided its last situation were in the towns of Weimar, Jena, or Eisenach. But if it were in other towns, then the attestation must be by the councillors of the place ; in villages, by the heads of the com munity ; and in detached farms, constituting a separate estate {\u2022'Eitter-guter\")hj the possessors of such estates, or their represen tative. \" Every master or mistress is bound, when the servant leaves, to write or dictate a certificate in the service-book, as to the length of the service, the cause of leaving, and the behaviour of servants in respect to honesty, fidelity, and industry. \u2022' The servant has to pay For the service-book itself \u2014 four groschens. For the vise\" of the police on the blank pages at the end of the book, previous to entering upon a new service \u2014 one groschen. For the vise, and writing in the same by the police at the time of quitting its last place \u2014 one groschen. \" If a servant has allowed itself to be hired by two masters con jointly, she is bound to go to the one with whom she made the first engagement. \" The servant, who so allows itself to be hired by two masters conjointly, is liable to a fine of from one to five thalers, or to proportional imprisonment. \" If a master knows of a servant having been previously hired at the time of his making a contract with it, then he also can be fined from five to ten thalers. \" Every contract for the hiring of a servant, who is still in service, if it be entered into more than a quarter of a year previous to the time for quitting its present situation, is invalid. \" The agreement as to the wages, board, or board- money, livery and presents, either at the year-markets or Christmas-time, for perquisites, or any additional thing, to be received, depends wholly and solely upon the arrangement made at the time of hiring. \" If no such arrangement has been entered into, then only board and wages are to be considered as having been tacitly un derstood by the parties, and nothing more is to be allowed by the authorities. \" The length of service likewise depends upon the previous arrangements of both parties. If, however, nothing is said about it at the time of hiring, then such servants as are hired principally"], [120, "104 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. for cleaning work, are to be considered as hired for a year ; but with other servants, the engagement is to be regarded as a quarterly one. \" The times for entering into service and quitting the same, are the 2nd January, 2nd April, 2nd July, and 2nd October every year ; or, whenever such dates fall on a Sunday, the Monday fol lowing. These days are generally called after the quarters of the year \u2014 Christmas, Easter, Midsummer, and Michaelmas. Any other time of quitting or entering service must be specially agreed upon. \" The hired servant must enter the service at the appointed time on pain of punishment. Only in the following cases is the hired servant justified in refusing to enter upon her service. \" (1.) If in the interval between the completion of the hiring contract, and the time appointed for it to enter the service, the servant is rendered incapable by illness. \" (2.) If in such interval, any relative of the sen-ant dies, or any other casualties occur to render the servant's presence at home indispensable. \"(3.) If the servant has the opportunity of marrying, or could, in any other way, advantageously settle itself in life, and would be likely to lose such a chance of benefiting itself by fulfilling its engagement. \u2022' (4.) If the family into which the servant is about to enter, change their place of residence, without advising the servant of the sume. \"(5.) If the master, without expressly mentioning the same. at the time of making the engagement, wishes to go a journey with the servant for a longer period than that mentioned at the time of hiring. \" In the 4th and 5th cases above specified, the hiring-money remains with the servant. But in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cases, the master may force the servant to return it to him. In the 3rd case, however, if the servant has not given notice, at least six weeks before, if hired by the quarter \u2014 and a fortnight before, if hired by the month \u2014 of such an alteration in her circumstances, then the master may, in any case, force the servant to enter his service, and remain there for the full term of the hiring. '\u2022 Tbe master must take the servant whom he has hired into his service, at the appointed time, or else give full compensation. \" A master may refuse to take or keep a hired servant in his service under the following circumstances."], [121, "SAXON SERVANTS'. 105 \" (1.) If the servant is found to be afflicted with fits, or any contagious or disgusting illness, even though it were afflicted with the same at the time of the hiring, but kept the matter a secret ; or if the servant catch any such disease at any subsequent period. \" (2.) If the servant is rendered incapable of working by illness or any misfortune. \" (3.) If the servant has so conducted itself in any former place that the master could have dismissed it immediately ; and, moreover, if either such master has not mentioned the fact in his certificate, or the servant not divulged it, when questioned as to its former character. \" (4.)

In the case of the master's death, the full quarter's wages, if the hiring be quarterly, are due to the servant, or a full month's wages if engaged by the month. \" Only in the following cases is the master justified in sending away his servant without previous notice. \"(1.) If the servant insults its master with abuse, or disre spectful language, or tries to create family dissensions, or ill-uses the children that have been entrusted to its care. \" (2.)

Next we have another pretty little police document running as follows : Certified, and it is to be noted, that this girl (giving her name) is now turned out of the town for one year, on account of being repeatedly pregnant. Eisenach, 4th August, 1859. For the Police Administration. B. Ortmann. Duly sealed, of course. Then follows the attestation of the authorities of the girl's native place : \u2014 The possessor of this book has been at home with her parents up to this time, and has conducted herself without reproach. Ereuzburg, 1st January, 1861. For the Principal Authorities, G. Kohler. After this the book teaches us that the young lady returns to Eisenach, visits the police, and is authorized to start in business again \u2014 having already, since her return, had two or three more of such worthless characters written at the end of the Dienst-buch, and all duly vouching, of course, that she has lived a pattern life during her stay in their houses. Now such solemn absurdities as the above, simple-minded English folk are utterly unprepared for \u2014 even from the extremely officious officials of Germany. Granted, that some of the regu lations are such only as the common principles of justice would dictate ; but, on the other hand, there are articles in the rules, which, assuredly, none but a Cossack or a Haynau could be found daring enough to uphold. For who, with any idea of decency or manly courage, would justify the sentence that tells us that \" moderate chastisement\" is not to be considered as any wrong done to a female servant by her master ; and that even when the girl is beaten she is to have no right of obtaining a summons against her brutal and cowardly persecutor ! In the land where the flogging of a wife by her husband is no offence against the law, unless blood be made to flow, the reader can readily under stand what may be a German policeman's notion of \"moderation\" in the use of the lash against a poor girl who has no power of defending herself. Again, how fair and honourable i3 the canon which ordains, that if a master unjustly accuses a servant-maid of theft, she shall have no claim for compensation from him, even though her character for honesty is all the poor drudge has to live upon !"], [126, "CHAPTER XII. BEFORE MARRIAGE. Suoh things as marriages for love are almost utterly unknown in Saxony. True, the father there does not select, with the same sang froid, the future husband for the girl, as is the wont in Palis, and bring home with him some fine afternoon a young or old gentleman, as the case may be, and introduce him to his daughter with the remark, *' Here, my child, I wish to present you to your future partner for life ; \" while the obedient young lady curtseys, and thanks her father for the present, as if it were a new dress, or a small box of kid gloves, rather than a being with whom her fortunes are to be mixed up for the rest of her days. The consequence of such marital arrangements is patent to all the world ; the infidelity of French married women being pro verbial in almost every nation. Now, we cannot say that precisely the same custom prevails in Thuringia ; nevertheless, matrimony there is assuredly not the result of affection between the parties, and the homes are conse quently nothing like the happy united circles, marked by one common interest and feeling, as with the better middle-class families of England. The property possessed by girls for miles round the Thuringian capital is known to almost every one of the citizens of the town ; and during our residence in Eisenach, we never heard of one love match occurring in the place. True, the Kantor (director of the church-music), who was said to be so overcome after the death of his first young wife that he would never be able to hold up his head again, was engaged to be married immediately after the first anniversary of his former partner's funeral, to the daughter of a"], [127, "BEFORE MARRIAGE. 111 chandler's-shopkeeper who had \"gone to pieces'' in Hamburg. And this would seem to be an exception to the rule. \" But,\" said the gossips of the town, as they talked over the fitness of the betrothal in the httle haberdashers' shops, where the women generally meet to buy Berlin wool and chatter scandal, \"leave M tiller Hartung alone for marrying anybody unless he is to get something as good as money with her.\" \" Ay, they do say,\" cried one of the old maids in the shop, \" that he is going to Hamburg with his bride, and that her rich uncle has promised to get him a number of pupils in that city.\" \"Ave, and God knows,\" added another, \"he'll want a number of them, to keep such a proud penniless minx of a wife as he is about to take to himself.\" As a further illustration of the universality of marriage either for money, or some worldly interest or other, we may mention the fact that, in the course of last year, immediately preceding the introduc tion of Gewerbefreiheit (literally, \"free trade,\" but more particularly the abolition of the restrictions against free working in Eisenach), it was the common talk at the taverns among the different journey men, who then thought of starting in business on their own ac count, as to which of the young women in the town had money enough to please them. \" Oh ! \" one would say, \" there is the butcher's daughter, the 'Great Globe' (Welt kugel) as she is called. She has got 1000 thalers at least.\" \" But, thundering weather!\" said another, \"she walks with that soldier who belongs to her own trade.\" \" Well, then, there's Gyps Hanchen (the latter name being short for Johanna, and the former the name of the girl's father ; for it is usual in Eisenach familiarly to describe the young woman as Brown's Peggy, or Jones's Molly, or Robin son's Sukey, as the case may be,) \"will she suit you?\" asks a third, \" for she's got her 500 thalers to bless you with.\" \" No,\" replies the other, \" she is a nice enough girl to look at. but it will cost me more than that to buy tools and wood, aud furnish a place to begin with.\" \" Come now,\" cries another of the company, \"what do you say to the Todten-graber's (grave-digger's) daughter? She has got enough to start a working goldsmith in business.\" \" Pfui ! devil!\" exclaims the worthy C\u0153lebs, \"Heaven forbid! I could never take a bride from the dead-house.\" \" Ha ! ha ! \" laugh the others. \" Hear how nice he is in his notions. Why, it's only a matter of taste, man ! (Geschmack-sache was the phrase used) whether she lives at the dead-house or at the confection er's.\""], [128, "112 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Nor must the reader imagine that such sentiments as the above are by any means limited to the lower orders of society. \" Who is that lady flirting so violently with the young officer yonder ?\" we said to a friend at one of the Klemda balls. \" Oh ! she is the Fraulein von Keingros,\" was the reply; \"and she has made love to every gentleman here for the last fifteen years. But, poor thing ! she will have to cast sweet eyes (Liebes augen) for many a year more, before she catches a man, since she has not one pfenning of her own to bless any husband with.\" The two principal heiresses of the town were the daughters of the distiller and the one wholesale grocer of the place ; and these were spoken of as being wealthy beyond all conception, and re garded with the same reverence as if they were the gilt mud-idols of some Indian village. For, as the German men informed you the one had no less than 40,000 thalers (\u00a36000 sterling) and the other as much as 60,000 thalers (which is equivalent to \u00a39000 of our money), they were in the habit of staring at you to watch your wonderment, as if they thought you never before could have heard of any young woman possessing such an amount of wealth. Moreover, the answer to an inquiry as to whether such and such a man was well-to-do would often run, \" Oh yes ! he is un commonly rich ; for he has been married three times, and always took care to have a good round sum with every one of his wives.\" Indeed, as a rule in Thuringia no man ever dreams of making a fortune by his own industry or enterprise : the accredited means of acquiring wealth among the Saxons are the lottery and mar riage, and as they gamble regularly in the one, so do they specu late uniformly in the other. Almost every unmarried mule sets a price upon himself ; and one gentleman, with very white teeth and an incipient bald head, was candid enough to inform us that he appraised himself at 7000 thalers, and would not think of walking with the prettiest girl in Creation if she possessed a groschen less than that sum. Indeed, almost every young person seems to start in life with the notion of making his way in the world, not by his own ener gies or prudence, but simply by getting hold of a girl with money. \" Oh ! I shall go to America or Russia,\" you will hear them say. \" and then the daughter of some rich merchant or nobleman will fall in love with me.\" And the mercenary wretches will cite you case after case, in which some countryman of theirs has prospered by such means. All the time we were resident in Eisenach, we repeat, we never"], [129, "113 BEFORE MARRIAGE. heard of one disinterested match; but we knew of many unions where the chief object was known to be, not the bride herself, but merely the means of taking a larger and a better shop, or of bting able to go into some more extensive way of business. Where such is the prevailing fashion, the reader can without much difficulty comprehend what must be the courtship, and how pleasant and loving the intercourse of the married couples united principally by such sordid motives. In most cases, however, the property which a girl possesses in her own right, or is given to her by her parents on her marriage, is settled on herself ; and that so completely that it generally re verts to the family rather than remains with her husband after her death. The landlord, for instance, of the Raths-keller, at Kreuzberg, married a miller's daughter, who was said to be worth a large sum. We happened to see the couple there, some few weeks before their wedding, cuddling (after the true German fashion) in the public beer-room ; and as the girl had sonievha,. of a prepossessing look, we could not help, some time after, in quiring of some of the Kreuzbergers, who came over to Eisenach on market-days, as to whether she was happy or not, in the choice she had made. \" 0 woe ! O woe ! \" was the answer ; \" the poor thing died five weeks after her wedding-dress was worn. So the landlord made a bad speculation there,\" they added; \"for even pfenning he got with his bride will have to go back to the family. now that she is no more.\" Moreover, even when there is little or no money in the family, it is often the custom of the parents of the bride to furnish the rooms of the young couple ; and, when this is done, the goods and chattels, in case of death, are expected to revert to those who gave them. \"Aye, it will be a sad misfortune to the Kantor (the uxorious gentleman before referred to) this death of his young wife,\" ran through the town immediately after the news of the poor girl's de cease was circulated, \" for his father-in-law may, if he please, strip his apartments of every stick of furniture he has in the place.\" In such a state of things it will be readily understood that there can be no such thing as one common interest, or one common feeling, pervading the several homes of Saxony. \"I have been obliged to pay so much for my man out of my money,\" you will hear one wife complain in public company; or it will be, \"My 8"], [130, "114 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. man owes me so much, and I can't get a Heller (the old name for tbe one-twelfth of a penny) from him ;\" or else, as our landlord was in the habit of saying to us, \" My wife has no business to come to you for the rent : this is my house, and let her look after the tenants in her own little mud-hovel in the Akkerhoff; for that's all she ever brought me when I married her.\" Or, may be, on the other hand, the Frau Shabbymantle will send another servile letter for the few groschens that is her due, urging that \" the money is her own, and that her husband is so stingy that she cannot get a pfenning from him for her girls' dresses for the balls.\" Further : not a few of the men lived entirely upon their wives' industry. One was a small watchmaker, whose sole occupation seemed to be to loll outside his shop in a dressing-gown and slip pers, aud smoke a long pipe in the middle of the day, and in the evening to betake himself to Fischbach to shoot at a target (for he belonged to the shooters' company of the town) ; while his wife was one of the principal milliners in the city, and therefore, as the people said, there was no necessity for him to work as hard us ordinary men. Let us now, after this brief introduction as to the motives which generally lead young people to come together in Saxony, proceed to describe, as faithfully as possible, what are the Thurin gian customs during courtship. From what we have before said, as to the utter want of paternal supervision in Saxe-Weimar, it will be almost supererogatory to state, that young people are left in such matters to do as they please. \" What time did your daughter,\" said we, to a painter, \" come home from the ball we heard she was at last night ? \" \" Oh God! \" exclaimed the callous old gentleman, \" I don't know ; I was out at the Apple-wine Rooms, and comfortably in my bed, long before she turned the key in the door.\" Accordingly, young people are left to pick up then mates at the concerts and balls of the town as they choose; for we have before said, that even at the Klemda dances, we hardly ever saw she father of a family there who thought it worth his while to for take his beer-house for the moral supervision of his child ; and we wave known fathers, who, when they heard that their daughters were in the habit of dancing at the Klemda, until their flounces here high above their knees, nevertheless, considered it by no"], [131, "115 BEFORE MARRI\\GE. means worth their while to accompany the young women to the ball as a safeguard to their proper conduct. Certainly, it is cus tomary for mothers to be present ou such occasions ; but they go there, as we have before explained, rather as the handmaids to the young women, ready to arnmge their skirts when they become ruffled, and to hand them dry pocket-handkerchiefs and small tooth combs whenever their personal appearance may stand in need of them. Moreover, the poor old creatures are often too tired with the day's housework, and the washing and ironing necessary for the preparation of Jhe ball-clothes of the girls, to do other than doze and nod as they sit against the wall, after the first few dances of the evening. Again, such is the laxity of modesty among German elderly women, that we doubt very much if these folk would, even with their eyes wide open, be vigilant guardians over the decent behaviour of any girl entrusted to their care. Further, even such poor protectors as these to a girl's virtue are often left at home, and the young women allowed to frequent balls and concerts without a single soul to look after them. Courtship, therefore, generally consists, in Thuringia, in meetings and secret interviews at some of the suburban beer-gardens round about the town ; for as servants with us are said to \" walk \" or \" keep company \" with their swains previous to marriage, this, so far as we could learn, was the only custom common in Eisenach, even among well-to-do folks, preliminary to the formal proposal for a young lady's hand. Such walks and meetings generally take place in the afternoon, when the father is at his business, or more probably at the beer-house, and the mother is left to the perfor mance of those common household duties which are generally con signed to servants in England ; while the daughters go flaunting abroad, dressed in all their best, to keep a rendezvous with some scape-grace of a so-called noble forest-man unknown to their parents. We never, during our many years' residence in Germany, heard of any gentleman being received at the parents' house while such love-making was going on ; and upon talking the matter over with our German friends, we were assured that such a custom was un known in Thuringia. The girls were allowed, we were told, to go out at all times of the day, and even night, unprotected, without hardly a question being asked as to whither they were going, previous to their departure ; or where they had been, or why they had remained so late, on their return. This secret and unguarded courtship continues until such tim"], [132, "116 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. as the gentleman thinks it fit, or necessary, to make a formal pro posal to the parents for his marriage with then daughter. This is seldom, or never done, in writing. The gentleman goes in proprid persona to the house of the father or mother, and tells the one or the other what Iris present income is, as well as what his prospects are ; adding, \" that he wishes to be united to the young lady at such and such a time.\" To such a proposal, an immediate \" yea \" or \" nay \" is invariably given, it being considered an insult if the parent consulted asks for time to consider the matter ; for in a small town like Eisenach, where not only the means, but the antecedents of every citizen are known to each other, it is obvious that hesitation implies dissent, and therefore such proposals are then and there assented or objected to. If the parents' consent be obtained, then a special feast is given, equivalent to the Roman \" Sponsalia \" to make known the formal betrothal of the couple. To the betrothal-supper, at which fish is a favourite dish, all the friends and acquaintances of the family are usually invited, and in the course of the entertainment, the bridegroom, as he is then called (for in Germany such public betrothals are almost equivalent to marriage with us \u2014 the young lady being spoken of as the gentleman's bride from that time forth), having previously ordered to be made two thick plain gold rings, inside one of which is engraven his own name, and in the other that of the young lady \u2014 proceeds to place the ring with his name inscribed upon it on the bride's left forefinger, and that with the lady's name upon the forefinger of his own left hand. Sometimes these rings are placed upon the finger of the bride and bridegroom in the presence of the entire assembly invited to be parties to the contract. In Saxony, however, it often occurs that the rings are placed on the fingers of the bride and bride- groom in the presence of the parents only, previous to the guests assembling ; and the betrothed couple then make then appearance at the table with the symbols of their engagement already upon their hands. At the feast the young couple sit together next to their parents, and an amount of public love-making and kissing goes on through the evening which any decent English father or mother would hardly be able to countenance. In the course of the entertain ment, after supper, when wine, grog, and punch are freely partaken of, the healths of the betrothed are drunk, \" with all the honours,\" \u2014 but speeches are seldom if ever made ; and the bride-"], [133, "117 BEFORE MARRIAGE. grooni in return, proposes a toast, wishing \" happiness and long life \" to all those present on the occasion. Hard drinking then usually continues up to a late hour \u2014 generally till one or two in the morning \u2014 the ladies sitting at the table till the very moment when the gentlemen retire. After the above formal ceremony of betrothal has been gone through, advertisements are inserted in the local newspapers announcing the fact ; or else, maybe, letters are printed and sent to the different friends and acquaintances of the young couple. At the same time, cards are struck off and despatched to friends at a distance, while visits are paid the next day by the \" happy pair \" to such as live in the immediate neighbourhood. The cards usual upon such occasions are printed in the following fashion \u2014 the titles of the towns in the corner being added so as to show to what district the parties respectively belong : \u2014 I Anna E Carl J verlohte. Eisenach. TFetzlar. Occasionally, at the time of betrothal, an Ehe-pacht, or marriage- contract, is entered into in writing, in which the property be- longing to either party is settled upon them, and provisions made in case of the death of either, &c. Such marriage-contracts, however, are by no means usual unless the betrothed pair belong to the wealthier classes. In citizen life it is more common for the father to tell the bridegroom (either immediately before or after betrothal) that he will give his daughter so many hundred thalers for her marriage outfit, and that after his death so many thousand thalers more will come to her. But no legal settle ments among the middle classes are usually made. The general sum promised is 100 thalers, or \u00a315, for the trousseau of the girl ; the father, moreover, undertaking to furnish the rooms for the"], [134, "118 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. bride and bridegroom. Indeed, the latter practice is so generally understood that no engagement is entered into upon the matter ; for, even among the very poor, it is customary for the bride to bring the beds and such furniture as can be spared at the time of marriage ; while, among the middle-class citizens, the father knows well that he is expected to supply all the furniture necessary for providing the young couple with a home fitting their station of life. These betrothals last usually from two to three years. Some times the marriage takes place within six months after the public affiance of the couple ; but, on the other hand, it is in many cases delayed for ten years, or even longer, until the means of the bride groom are sufficient to justify his entering into the matrimonial state. Immediately after betrothal the \" outward and visible\"' conduct of the young lady towards the young gentleman is entirely changed. Before being affianced, a German girl thinks it extremely indecent to touch the ungloved hand of any young man, nor would she, for her life, be seen walking arm-in-arm with a gentleman unless she were known to be engaged to him. In deed, to such an extent is this carried, that young German ladies who were in the habit of visiting at our house, thought it a great act of grace on then part to shake us by the hand on entering and quitting our roof, and told our daughter that they did so only in conformity with English manners and customs ; adding that \" they could not for the life of them ever bring themselves to do the same thing to one of their own countrymen.\" At the same time, it is by no means unusual with the ladies who are acquainted with the manners of Austria to allow their hands to be kissed even by a perfect stranger shortly after their introduction to a gentleman, and that without the least reluctance being shown, or the faintest tinge of a blush suffusing their cheeks at the time. After betrothal, however, tout est changi, and the young prude who was ashamed to touch the naked fingers of the gentleman a few days before, thinks it by no means unbecoming of her sex to appear in the public streets hanging on to his arm, and looking up into his eyes ; or to sit the evening through at some concert or theatrical performance with her lover's arm twined around her neck."], [135, "CHAPTER XIII. MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. We now come to the time of marriage ; and before proceeding to narrate the details of the ceremony in Saxony, it is essential that we should make the reader acquainted with certain preliminaries required by the State. In the first place, be it recorded, that no man can marry until he is four-and-twenty years of age ; and even then, if he be a workman, he must petition the Town Council for permission so to do, and be able to show that he is engaged by such and such a master, and has every chance of continuing in his employment. Or if he wishes to take unto himself a wife from any of the neighbouring villages, he can only do so by ob taining the permission of the town authorities, and paying, more over, some 30 thalers (\u00a34 10s.) for the purchase of the lady's freedom of the city. Subjoined are several such petitions for marriage, copied from the \" State's Order of the Day,\" published in the local paper, March 19th, 1863. (9.) Petition of the Building-Inspector Moder for the reception of his betrothed into the community of Eisenach. (10.) Petition of the day-labourer Hermann Kesselring, of this town, to be pardoned from the taxes due to the town on his mar rying again. (15.) Petition of the cooper Ludwig Orthey, of this town, for the reception of his betrothed (into the community of Eisenach.) (21.) Petition of the book-printer Georg Thon, of this place, for the reception of his betrothed (into the community of Eisenach.) We may add, while dealing with this part of our subject, that the taxes paid to the city by every person previous to marriage, consist of the following curious items. Two thalers (6s.) for turning the organ, six groschens six pfennings (j\\d.) to the"], [136, "120 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. organist, two thalers 1 6s.) towards the support of the town baud, and twelve groschens six pfennings (13|<i.) for \"tree money,\" that is to say, for keeping in order the few trees growing \" within the walls.\" These charges sound very much like impositions to au Englishman ; for why newly-married couples should be made to bear the expense of the city arboriculture, and to contribute so largely towards the maintenance of the city band, seeing that this band never plays at weddings ; and why they should have to pay so heavily for turning the church organ, is more than common sense can understand. Moreover, if the Benedict be not already a citizen of the town, he must, before obtaining the permission of the municipal autho rities to marry, take out his Burgcr-schein (certificate of citizenship), and for this he must pay 60 thalers, and prove, besides, that he is the owner of at least 500 dollars' worth of property. Up to the year 1848, marriage in Thuringia was a solely clerical affair ; but since the revolution, the chief power of permitting or forbidding unions is vested in the State, so that now the clergy man has no longer the power of refusing to wed any persons who come to him provided with the requisite State papers, as well as the consent of the parents on either side. Moreover, in the Town Council, the power is now vested of pro hibiting such marriages as are thought to be impolitic for ethno logical reasons. In the first place, people of weak minds or of imbecile nature can be prevented by the municipal authorities from entering into the matrimonial state. So, we were assured by many, the town officials had the power of forbidding the union of the deaf and dumb ; others, on the contrary, as strongly de clared that they had no right to withhold a marriage license from such people. We can only add that the deaf and dumb per sons whom we knew in Eisenach were all single, and we always heard that the State compelled them to remain so. On the other hand, the city laws offered no impediment to the union of the blind, the crippled, or the consumptive \u2014 the only persons, indeed, with whose marriage the State thinks it necessary to interfere, beyond the idiots and others above mentioned, being working men, military officers, and common soldiers. But these, \" the powers that be\" still delight to treat as children incapable of thinking aud acting for themselves. Time was when the custom prevailed in Germany for the herald of the Emperor to blow his trumpet in the market-place, and announce to the folk there assembled that his Serene"], [137, "M URIU.'.GE CUSTOMS. 121 Majesty had been graciously pleased to give his consent to the alliance of Herr Miiller with Fraulein Sehulz. But though such things have long passed away from the land, the equally-absurd practice continues of forcing every working man to remain single until he can prove to the town authorities that he can support a family. The same restrictions, too, as are imposed upon the marriage of working men, likewise hold good against \" officers and gentlemen,\" it being impossible for a lieutenant in the army to take a wife unto himself, unless she is possessed of 6000 thalers (\u00a3900) in hard cash \u2014 an amount of capital which, at the rate of 5 per cent, interest, would give \u00a345 the year! for the sup port of the lady and her family. The chief absurdity, however, in connection with this part of the marriage restrictions imposed by the State, remains to be told. If the bride elect of the officer be a Yon, that is to say, a lady of noble family, then money may be entirely dispensed with ; though surely it must be obvious to anyone with a brain bigger than a walnut, that in such a case the sole reason for any money at all being required, viz., that the officer may be enabled to live according to his station, as well after marriage as before, becomes doubly enforced ; since the \" gracious lady\" is likely to be a person of more expensive habits, and to require greater state and ceremony than the daughter of a simple citizen. It is presumed, however, by the obsequious State functionaries that the daughter of a baron is sure to be possessed of means sufficient for the support of her husband. Of the under, or non-commissioned, officers in the army, only five of the oldest out of every 250 of the sergeants and quarter masters are permitted to enter into the matrimonial state ; whilst the common soldiers are utterly forbidden such an indulgence. The consequent state of immorality among the females in the garrison towns is far lower even than it is with us. One other legal restriction concerning marriage, and we have done with the political control exercised over the subject. The usual time of mourning for a deceased wife in Saxony is twelve months, which is known by the name of the Trauer-jahr. Some times, however, a widower wishes to put an end to his supposititious grief before the allotted term, and to become once more a Bene dict \u2014 the incorrigible ! Maybe, as we were told, he has a large family or an extensive business, and requires some trustworthy female to look after the one or the other (without any regular salary) ; in such a case he has merely to send a petition to the so-called Ministerium at Weimar, and if the circumstances are"], [138, "122 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. such as to justify a termination of the mourning, and to warrant the revelry of another wedding, then the happy-miserable wretch with the large family, or the large business, receives permission to take unto himself some new nurse or shopwoman in the cheap est possible manner, i.e. by marrying the lady, and so getting rid of her wages. We now come to deal with the ecclesiastical rather than the political restrictions to marriage in Thuringia ; aud it will be seen that if the stupid State authorities must and u-ill meddle with matters in which they have no moral nor social light to interfere, the Church ordinations, on the other hand, are so lax that the regulations cannot but appear more fit for the communion of the sexes among unthinking animal life than rational beings. We all know how many years the fight has gone on in our own country in order to legalize marriage with a deceased wife's sister. In Germany, however, not only is such intercourse considered in no way objectionable, but the Church even permits nieces to marrv with their uncles, and nephews with their aunts. \" Would you,\" said we to a German friend, \"permit the marriage of a man with his own step-mother? or of a girl with her step-father?\" \" Ja wohl\" was the answer, \"and why not? They are in no way related one to the other.\" \"Then, perhaps, a man may marry his mother-in-law, if he be so inclined ?\" \" Gewiss,' he can,\" was the answer, \"and a girl her own father-in-law or brother-in-law when she has the mind.\" \"Well, then,\" urged we, \"is it for- bidden in your country for a man to wed with his own grand- mother ? \" The gentleman was somewhat in doubt as to the latter point, though he candidly confessed to us that he did not see any reason why a person should not be allowed to do so, if the lady were only young enough and had sufficient money to make the match agreeable. Nor is the insensibility upon such matters confined solely to the male sex in Thuringia. A young lady, who was the daughter of one of the Government officials, told us, without a blush upon her cheeks, that she herself wanted to have married her mother's own brother, only, unfortunately, he had betrothed himself at an after period to a girl in Weimar. Whereupon we could not help asking her, why, if there was no objection to ladies marrying with their mother's brother, should not brothers and sisters be per- mitted to unite themselves ? \" Oh, no ?\" we were told, \" that was quite a different matter ;\" and so astonished were the ladies"], [139, "123 MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. of the town when they heard that English people objected to the marriage of uncles with their nieces, that it was the talk among the female members of the fashionable singing-club for many an evening afterwards, and cases upon cases were cited to the mem bers of our family to prove how common was the custom in Thu ringia. A girl may marry at ahy age, as soon as possible, indeed, after confirmation ; but, as we have before said, no man can enter into the matrimonial state in Thuringia until he has attained his twenty-fourth year, without a special \" dispensation,\" as it is called, from Weimar ; but if a damsel be possessed of consider able property, it is by no means unusual for the child to have a husband before she is fifteen. Formerly, it was the custom for men to marry at an earlier period of life, so that old-fashioned people had a saying that if mere boys were allowed to become husbands, who would there be to pray at the table ? or, in other words, what person in the family would be present, fit to ask a blessing before partaking food ? It is a peculiar custom in Saxony, that the property of the wife, in case of her death without children, invariably returns to the family. This is part of the laws of the country, and it is in no way usual for the relatives of the deceased wife to forego them. Indeed, so generally is this understood, that legal settlements previous to marriage are by no means customary. As a rule, the husband brings nothing at the time of matrimony ; he may have a business or a situation, but property is seldom or never expected on his part ; for this, and indeed, the very furniture and beds of the apartments in which the couple are to live, he looks to his bride, such being the ordinary inducements with gentlemen to enter into matrimony in Saxony. The interest of the money be longing to the bride goes to the husband, even during her lifetime, and over this he has as full and entire a control as if the capital belonged to him. But, in case of the lady's death after having given birth to one or more children, the money is then divided equally among the husband and the sons and daughters who are left behind. In case the girl has no property of her own, then it is cus tomary with the bridegroom to consult his future father-in-law as to what sum of money he is to expect from him at \"the time of marriage. On such occasions it is usual in citizen life for the parents of the young woman to tell the bridegroom that he can expect nothing from them until the property is divided among"], [140, "124 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. their children, with the exception may-be of 100 to 300 thalers (\u00a315 \u2014 \u00a345), by way of outfit\u2014 the latter amount being considered a liberal sum, with the ordinary Kauf-leute (chandler's-shopkeep ers) or master tradesmen in the town. \"But,\" said we to the friends whom we consulted on such matters, \"what do gentlefolks generally give at such times?\" \" Give !\" was echoed with an indignant laugh, \"why they have nothing to bestow.\" But we reminded our friend that the daugh ter of the President of the Assizes was married while we were living in Eisenach, and surely she must have had something as her dower. \"Ach gar!\" was the contemptuous answer; \"the rich manufacturers \" (those whom we have before described as carrying on their works in the lowest-possible description of mud-' hovels, and as paying the worst wages, and having the least care of their workpeople in the \u2022whole city) \u2014 \" the Geizhals gave the girl her outfit because they thought it better to curry favour with the Judge.\" Nevertheless, we persisted, there was the young officer with the big eyes, who was married to the Colonel's daughter. \"What has a Colonel here to give his child?\" was the answer; \" Bah ! the junior lieutenant thought of getting his captaincy, and that was enough for him.\" Such, we believe, is a true account of the expectations and in ducements with regard to marriage among the different classes in the Thuringian capital, Still, there were some points that we ourselves required to have cleared up. So we consulted our friends once more as to the solution of certain marital mysteries that needed explanation. \" If,\" said we, \" it is the rule here that, in case of the death of the wife, the property she brought returns to the members of her family, how came it that old Brandt, the dry-salter, who died so rich the other day, got the greater part of his money by marrying three times \u2014 as the story runs?\" \"That is true,\" was the answ-er, \" but he was clever enough to marry three old maids who were sisters, and as fast as one of them died he wedded another of the family, to whom his previous wife's property had gone, and so he ultimately got it all to himself.\" \" There is one other difficulty we cannot get over,\" we added, \" and that is, how came it that the Kantor of the Church, when he lost his young wife, within a year of their marriage, was allowed to retain the furni ture and beds with which his father-in-law had stocked his rooms?\" \"Oh! that is very simple,\" ran the reply; \"for though the"], [141, "MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. 125 father-in-law did not take them back at first, he no sooner heard that the man was about to be publicly betrothed again immedi ately the ' mourning year ' was at an end, than he sent and strip ped the rooms, and left him only a few necessary articles in the place.\" \" Is it then law,\" said we, \" or merely custom that the wife should bring the beds and furniture with her ? \" \" It is merely customary that she should bring them, and legal that the father has the power of reclaiming them as soon as he pleases after the decease of his daughter. But even the custom of the bride bringing such things with her is so invariable, that if the law enforced it, it could not be more strictly observed,\" con tinued our informants; \"for the very poorest people in the land would rather leave themselves without a stick in their homes than that their daughter should marry without being able to take, at least, a bed and a few things with her.\" In the olden times it was usual for the girls in Germany to begin spinning the linen that was to serve them as an outfit at the time of marriage, almost as soon as they went to school, and to continue doing so up to the period of their wedding ; so that large carved and painted chests came to be stocked with all kinds, and no end of under-clothing, as well as with stockings and other knitted articles ; for but a few years ago, owing to the custom of washing but once or twice a-year in each family, a much larger stock of clothes was required than is found necessary at the pre sent day. And such is the force of habit that we heard of many matrons in Eisenach who could count then- stockings by the hun dred, and their chemises by the score. Moreover, in the Rhenish provinces, and other parts of Germany, we happen to know that these same marriage chests still continue to be stocked, for the young girls still go on spinning and knitting against their mar riage day, as every German girl was wont in the time of yore. In Eisenach, however, we were assured the young ladies had got to be too lazy and fashionable to pursue such work, and now the mothers are left to do it for them ; and this is the reason why you hardly ever go to a concert, a theatre, or a beer-garden in Thuringia without seeing the old women knitting away as me chanically as if they were so many stocking looms ; while the young ones are flirting and pretending to be busy with soms trumpery \"crochet-work\" or \"tatting.\" We now come to the marriage-feasts and ceremonies themselves."], [142, "126 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. On the evening before the marriage there is a peculiar feast held \u2014 the nuptial eve in Germany being styled the Polter-Abend, the literal meaning of which is the \"noisy evening,\" from the verb poltern, to make a noise, or bluster. The word Polter-kammer also means a lumber-chamber, and as it is customary for the townsfolk to get rid of all their old broken crockery on such oc casions, the term Polter, as applied to this strange ceremony, may have some such significance. Stripped of the symbolical riot which goes on outside the doors, the feast given within is merely the arch\u00e6lological remains of the old Roman entertainment given on the night before the nuptials ; for it is still the custom in Germany for the bridesmaids to bring the myrtle wreath, which they have subscribed together to purchase, to the house of the bride, and to present her with it on that occasion. A feast usually accompanies this ceremony, to which all the friends and relatives are invited. The feast itself generally consists of fresh-water fish \u2014 sausages, of course \u2014 baked goose and hare stuffed with onions (if such luxuries can be obtained), or else of beefsteaks and baked veal with Sauer-kraut or salad \u2014 raw salt herrings and raw ham \u2014 as well as apple or cream-tart or \" sand-cake \" \u2014 together with \" bowls \" of sweetened wine, or of hot egg-punch, or glasses of hot grog, after the usual fashion of the most elegant entertainments in the Thuringian capital. Minor feasts of the same character are somewhat similar to the above, with the exception of being curtailed of the more expen sive articles, and they are, one and all, prolonged till a late hour in the morning \u2014 the ladies remaining with the gentlemen all the while, and hob a nobbing with them. While this feast is going on inside the house, a greater riot, if possible, is being kept up in the street outside of it : for soon after midnight it is the cus tom of the townsfolk ou these Polter-abends to bring out all the old broken crockery, pots and pans, they can collect, and to throw them one after another at the door. The noise thus made by the smashing of the several articles, is considered to be prophetic as well as symbolical of the disturbances likely to ensue between the couple in after-life. So general is this practice on the nuptial eve, that the heap of broken crockery often extends half across the street before the morning, and two or three wagons are some times required to carry away the fragments. Indeed, on one occasion, when a drunken sadler-master, who bore one of the worst characters in the city, was about to be united, the whole of"], [143, "127 MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. the citizens turned out, each with something to cast against the door of the bride \u2014 for we should mention that such feasts are always given by the relatives of the girl. Nor did the citizens cease until the portals were broken open, and the thoroughfare completely blocked up with the shattered missiles. On the morning, or the evening, after the \" Polter-Abend \" the wedding itself takes place \u2014 the morning being the fashionable time, and the afternoon the time more usual with the citizens, for such ceremonies. Previous to the hour fixed for the wedding, the space immediately in front of the altar is covered with tall green shrubs, and the floor strewn with fresh flowers, which are arranged into patterns all the way to the principal entrance. At the same time, the richer friends send whatever plate they may happen to possess \u2014 the borrowed silver articles being one and all set out so as to make as great a show as possible on the commu nion-table itself. Moreover, the one extremely wealthy friend who happens to possess a strip of carpet, as big as a hearth-rug, (for sanded floors prevail in the houses of the gentry, as in English tap-rooms,) generally contributes such a luxury, and this is laid down on the spot where the bride and bridegroom are to stand, and has very much the appearance of the narrow strip of Kidder minster, which it is customary to spread beside an English ser vant's bedstead. The costumes usual upon such occasions with the rich are low-necked ball-dresses and dance -wreaths for the bridesmaids \u2014 such ball-dresses being made of muslin, net, or tarlatan, and of the showiest possible colours ; while the bride generally makes her appearance in a flimsy white silk, with a broad strip of white net streaming down from the back of her myrtle wreath. With the middle class, however, it is usual for the bride to be married in black silk, while the bridesmaids are attired in low-necked ball-dresses made of cotton print. The ceremony itself is of the briefest possible description, the service-proper consisting merely in the clergyman asking each of the parties whether they intend to take the other for his, or her wedded partner for life ; then the betrothal rings are exchanged, and the religious part of the ceremony ends with the curtest prayer for the happiness of the couple. The remainder of the rites are ni\"re of a moral and social, than an ecclesiastical character, consisting merely of an unimpressive speech from the clergyman in which he, in the tritest-possible platitudes mixed with a strong dash of silly sentimentalism, points out to the lady"], [144, "GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. 128 t and gentleman the advantages of living happily and comfortably together, and descants at greater or less length upon the beauty and virtues of the bride, according to the amount of the fee he has received for so doing. For a douceur of twenty groschens, the oration lasts but five minutes, whilst if the gratuity reach to the amount of two thalers, the leaden materials of the discourse are hammered out, so as to spread over very nearly half an hour. In addition to the latter fee, the clergyman is often invited to the wedding breakfast ; at which, say the Germans, he generally eats enough to last him for six weeks at least. The marriage rites concluded, the happy couple, and the groomsmen and bridesmaids, as well as the relatives and friends present on the occasion, return in open carriages, festooned with oak garlands, through the town \u2014 the ladies without any other covering than the wreaths on their head \u2014 to the house of the bride's father, where another feast ensues. This usually consists of coffee and cake at first, after which wine and sandwiches and herring salads, &c, are served ; whilst towards the evening a \" grand supper \" is provided, and the feast continues with the usual accompaniments of drinking and drunkenness as before de scribed. As the clock strikes twelve at midnight, the most peculiar part of the entertainment takes place. Then two of the bridesmaids take the wreath from the bride's head, and the sprig of myrtle from the buttonhole of the bridegroom ; after which a handker- chief is tied over the eyes of the newly-married lady, and when her own myrtle wreath has been placed in her hand, the un- married girls proceed to dance round her in a circle, while she tries to place the garland upon the head of one of the damsels -kipping about her. Whoever may happen to have the wreath placed on her head is, as the belief runs, certain to be married within a year from that date. The same kind of ceremony goes i ;i with the bridegroom, and while the single folk are dancing, ; be rest of the party sing certain verses to the air of the \"Brides \u25a0 : id's Chorus,\" in \" Der Freischutz.\" When the dance and song are finished, a white muslin cap, vi ich has been made by the bridesmaids expressly for the occa- m, is placed upon the newly-married lady's head'as a sign tha* - o is now a dame ; while the gentlemen proceed to cover the ,, ,d of the bridegroom with an ordinary white cotton nightcap hat has a tassel at the crown of it."], [145, "MARRIAGE CUSTOMS. 129 This part of the ceremony being ended, the company all seat themselves again, and the drinking and jesting go on as before. In a few minutes, however, one of the gentlemen disappear. quietly under the table and removes a garter from the leg of every one of the ladies present, it being the custom with the dam sels on such occasions to wear bright ribbons expressly for this part of the ceremony. The ribbon garters are then handed up above the table and cut into small pieces for each of the gentlemen to wear at his button-hole, like the decoration of the \" Legion of Honour.\" Nor must English people, who would hardly believe that such a custom could exist among civilized folk at the present day, imagine that this part of the bridal festivities prevails only among the coarser grades of people. On the contrary, it is practised at the entertainments even of the wealthier classes, and indeed the ancient custom is not omitted at the wedding of royal personages in Germany. In the course of the same entertainment, moreover, three plates are carried round among the company \u2014 on the first of which is placed some salt and a piece of burnt linen. This is intended as auother coarse kind of joke, to intimate that the cook has scorched her chemise while dressing the supper, and requests a trifle from the company towards the purchase of a new one ; whereupon every one of the gentlemen usually contributes a five- groschen piece as the plate is handed to him. The second of these plates is for the Currend scholar who usually attends with his box at such parties, and sings to the guests some well-known hymn, such as Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott, in which the whole assembly join. And when the chant is ended, the Currend plate is sent round, while the lad is feasted with cake and wine as the five-groschen pieces drop into it. The third, and last, plate into which the company are expected to place some small silver coin has a few tooth-picks in the middle of it, as a sign that the collection is intended for the waiter. \" Moreover,\" said the simple German friend to whom we are in- debted for much information in connection with such matters, \" everybody is expected to bring some present to the house on the wedding-day ; and therefore people like much more now-a-days to go to christening parties, for then only the godfathers and god mothers have to give anything, and weddings everybody says cost a great deal too much for a citizen to take part in them very often.\" 9"], [146, "130 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. The wedding presents here spoken of generally consist of either jewellery or household articles, such as cups and saucers, clocks, or, indeed, even pots and pans and flat irons. Another of the coarse jokes prevalent at such times is to pre sent the newly-married lady with the figure of a stork (for this bird in Thuringia is said to be the bearer of little children), the figures being made either out of sugar-stuff, porcelain, or even wood, and the bird being generally represented either with a baby dangling from his bill, or else with a couple of tiny infants rest ing on his back, and holding a label in his beak, upon which is written, \"1 congratulate you.\" Subjoined is an engraving of such a figure, copied from one purchased at the principal confectioner's in Eisenach. Or maybe the \"funny man\" of the party purchases at the confectioner's a little model of a Wickel-kind (a child in swaddling clothes), dressed as the German babies usually are ; and this he manages to introduce under the napkin of the bride's plate pre vious to the company sitting down to supper. These marriage feasts usually last one entire day in the city, the bride and bridegroom being present all the time, and the company seldom if ever separating until the next morning."], [147, "CHAPTER XIV. AFTER MARRIAGE. \" How long does the honeymoon generally last in Saxony ?\" we inquired of a communicative German friend. \" The honeymoon ?\" iterated the gentleman. \" Oh, yes ! I do remember that is your name for what we call the Flitter u-oche\" (literally, the tinsel-week). \" But,\" said we, \" do you really limit the happiness of newly-married life to one week only?\" \"Jawohl!\" our friend answered, \"and I should think a man has plenty of it by that time ; and has been married long enough, too, to repent of his bargain.\" Assuredly matrimony in Germany is anything but a pleasant or loving state for the women ! \" There are two creatures in German}7 whose lot I do not envy,\" was the remark of an English lady to us, \" the cows and the married women;\" and for our own part we hardly know which is treated the worst. From the very day of the wedding, the husband never sleeps in the same bed, and hardly ever in th. \u25a0 same room as his wife ; and from the end of the very first week after he has sworn to love and protect her, he never passes one evening at home with her, the young wife being left to sit with her servant if she have one, or, if not, utterly alone, in the dingy little room adjoining the kitchen, knitting, or darning, or sewing, until the gentleman staggers home from the beerhouse an hour or two before midnight. \" If a man's wife be a decent woman,'\" the German men tell you, \" she will not allow him to stay at home in the evening.\" The majority of the wives, they say, wish their husbands to go out, \" for they know,\" you are told, \" that by going to a tavern a man is enabled to do better in his business.\" The wives, themselves, however, tell a very different story ;"], [148, "132 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. and we hardly ever spoke with a married dame in Germany who did not complain bitterly of the way in which women were treated in her own country, saying, \" that they were looked upon as little better than beasts of burden by their husbands, and treated as such ; and that marriage-contracts were entered into merely as a means for men to get money and furniture enough to start in life.\" Nor do they fail to speak in the most glowing terms, on the other hand, of the respect which they have heard is generally paid to women in England ; or to contrast the lonely and wretched state of a woman's married life in their own land with the com fortable and sociable family evenings that they have read of as being customary in every decent English household. \"Heaven forbid,\" said a German young lady to us in Coblenz, after we and our wife had been introduced to her, \" that I should ever marry one of my own countrymen ! You English married people, when you go walking together, do so arm-in-arm ; but when a German husband takes his wife out in the holidays he strolls on ahead, without giving heed to her, whilst she is left be hind with the maid-servant to take care of the children. Besides, no Englishman can understand the coldness, not to say the cruelty, with which German wives are treated by their husbands at home. True, they see but httle of them ; but when they do, the words are far oftener abuse and oaths than kindly and affectionate ones ; for the man, when he leaves the tavern, after drinking five or six glasses of beer, and losing, perhaps, some few groschens at cards, is not in the very best of humours to be spoken with.\" Nor is the cruelty to which married ladies have to submit of a mere passive description, wife-beating being as common in Saxony as it is exceptional in England, and the men who resort to it being in no way ashamed of the practice ; so that well-to-do, educated people, ranking as gentlemen in the land, will talk openly in the beerhouse of the Maul-schellen (ringing slaps on the mouth) or Earbatschen (cuts with the whip) which they have given their wife the evening before. Nor can you make the low-natured brutes comprehend that such conduct is either cowardly or un manly. \" Why should you not beat a woman ?\" they will coolly ask you. \" You do children, and women are but little better than they compared with men.\" \"Can a woman,\" said we, \"claim protection of the State if her husband beat her ? \" \" Yes,\" was the characteristic answer, \" if the blood flows, but not otherwise.\""], [149, "AFTER MARRIAGE. 133 The consequence is, that sticks which merely raise wheals upon the flesh, rather than lacerate the skin, are the most approved weapons for the punishment of refractory wives \u2014 after the hand of the husband himself. \" For,\" said a German, who was rather learned upon such matters, to us, \" the hand is always ready when it is wanted, and a good Ohrfeige\" (box on the ear) \"is not soon forgotten by one's wife, I can tell you.\" But even when the man makes the blood flow, and he is sum moned before the town authorities for his cruelty to his wife, the State inflicts no punishment upon the fellow ; but the couple are merely asked if they will have a divorce, and if this be objected to, a clergyman is sent to them to talk over their differences, and to try to put an end to the dissension between them. Such are the laws in Saxony for the protection of women, and with such laws it is not difficult to imagine what must be the character of the husbands, and what the treatment of the wives in such a country. Moreover, when it is borne in mind, that until within the last twelvemonth, a pair of linen drawers used to be kept at the police-office, and women beaten, with these on, with a thick stick by one of the gens d'armes of the town, who can wonder that the men in Saxony should treat the women hke beasts of burden ; or that the poor Fraus should have to lead the wretched, loveless, comfortless, and companionless lives they do \u2014 being looked upon merely in the light of charwomen, whose duty it is to scrub the house, and wash and iron the linen \u2014 and left to pass the long evenings in utter solitude, and then thrust into a mere cupboard at night to sleep, and, may be, to weep over their blows \u2014 alone ? Again : even with the class of married men who are a shade less brutal towards their partners than those who delight to beat them, as many do, up and down the street with a stick, in the presence of their neighbours, the cruelty is often only of a less corporal character ; though sometimes quite as sharp and stinging as the stoutest whip. One would naturally suppose that, in a land where the husbands almost invariably treat the wives with such coolness and cruelty as would indicate that they were heartily sick of the contract they had entered into ; and where the women suffer so much from the neglect and brutality of their \" men,\" that neither one nor the other party would be anxious for a repetition of the slavery, the \" wailing and gnashing of teeth,\" when they had once been eman cipated from it. True, such second marriages do not often occur"], [150, "134 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. on the women's side ; among our friends in Eisenach, indeed, we knew but one or two instances of wives who had second hus bands, and in each of those cases the ladies were possessed of considerable property (for Saxony) in their own right. Whereas, on the other hand, the majority of married men with whom we were acquainted in the town had been married, not only twice, but in many cases thrice, and in one or two instances as often as four times \u2014 such subsequent marriages being often with the rela tives of the dead wife, and that for the reasons before given For example : there was the Herr Steuer Revisor, he had had a couple of wives ; there was the Lord Chamberlain and Palace Captain, he, too, had indulged in the same luxury ; there was the cashier to the principal brewery, who had taken unto himself another Frau ; there was the chemist to the principal manufac turer, the Colonel of the Grand Duke's one regiment, who had also been twice to the altar ; and, indeed, without boring the reader with the dry particulars, we may add, for the curiosity of the matter, that we found, upon running over the list of our ac quaintances, that far more than half of them had called upon the clergyman for an encore of the marriage-ceremony. Of those who had been three times married, there were, again, several in stances. We have before cited the case of the old dry-salter, who had married three old maids, each the sister of his preceding wife, so that he might retain in his own hands the property after the death of each of them. Moreover, the gentleman who occu pied our lodgings on the Market Place, at the expiration of our term there, asked our permission to move some of his pictures into the apartments previous to the day of our giving them up. Among the collection was the portrait of a delicate-looking girl, in the costume worn about thirty years ago; and when we in quired whether it was the picture of any relative, the unabashed answer was, \" That is the portrait of the first of my three -wives.\" And here, too, the catalogue might be extended, were it worth the reader's while to listen to the ugly details. Then, again, it was well known in the town that the palace jeweller had had as many as four wives, even though he was barely forty years of age ; and, upon inquiring as to how it was possible for so young a man to have been married so often, we received the following curious and illustrative particulars \u2014 \" His first wife had died of typhus, or what, in Saxony, is called nervous, fever ; the second he worried to death ; the third ran away to escape his ill-treatment, and died a few days before"], [151, "AFTER MARRIAGE. 135 the divorce was about to be obtained ; and the fourth, though still alive, it was believed by the citizens would soon be in her grave, owing to the same conduct on the brutal fellow's part.\" However, not to trust our own individual experience in such a matter, we consulted some persons in the town who were likely to be best informed upon the matter ; for it must be remembered that in a city hke Eisenach, numbering only 13,000 inhabitants, the antecedents and \" belongings \" of every citizen are known to the other ; so, after summing up with them the number of people who they knew had married twice, thrice, and even a fourth time, and dividing such numbers by the rest of the married population, the following strange statistics were obtained : \u2014 One-fourth of the whole of the husbands in the city had been a second time married. About one-eighth had been three times united ; and perhaps one in every sixty-four of the husbands had had as many as four wives. The next part of this extremely pretty little chapter in the history of the manners aud customs of the modern Saxon people, consists of the facts connected with the desertion of women by their husbands ; for it is a common rule among the master-trades men, provided they do not live happily with their wives, to obtain from them, upon some pretext or other, money enough for a voy age to America \u2014 the fellows promising that, if they do well in the New Country, they will send for them as soon as possible : but, in nine cases out of ten, not writing a word to their family ever afterwards. Examples of this practice were by no means uncommon in Eisenach; indeed, we knew several within the limits of our own experience, and, though our German friends assured us that one per cent, of the entire married population was a fair average as to the number of wives who had been de serted under such circumstances, we are inclined to believe, from tbe many instances we heard of such conduct in the Thuringian capital alone, that the estimate should be increased, at leaet, five-fold. In some cases, however, it is usual, when all the man's money has been squandered in America, and he finds he cannot do so well there as he did while living upon his wife's earnings at home, to send a penitent letter back, saying, \" that he cannot live without her,\" and begging for funds to return. This was the case with the husband of the principal midwife of Eisenach, and when the gentleman came back he walked about the streets \"got up \" like a Broadway buck, smoking his cigar, and never did another stroke of work, unless it was to act as one of the spies"], [152, "136 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. which the Grand Duke thinks it necessary to support for the better information of the \" Circle Director\" ruling over the neigh- bourhood. Another man, whom we knew, was a wagon-master, and he never made his appearance until he heard that his wife had in his absence paid off all the debts he had left behind him ; then, suddenly, one morning, a letter arrived, saying, \" that he was on his way from Hamburgh to her, with a heart full of love, but, he regretted to add, without any money in his pocket.\" The third case was that of the principal cabinet-maker of the city, who ran away, leaving his wife encumbered with five children, and several hundreds of thalers debts on his account ; and it was only when the hard-working dame had been able to establish a good business for herself and children, and had managed by extreme prudence to redeem all the mortgages upon the house, that she heard her \"man\" had threatened to come back and claim the property as his own, immediately it was free of debt ; where- upon the house and business had to be made over to the eldest son to prevent the wife losing everything ; and then the gentle man, having been duly informed of what had been done, did not think it worth his while to \" enter an appearance,\" as the lawyers say. Such examples might be added to by the score ; suffice it, wife desertion is sufficiently common among the trading and working classes of Saxony to sbow that it is by no means an exceptional form of social atrocity, as well as to teach the reader, were any further instances needed, how slight and slender is the matrimo uial tie in that country. m But, in all fairness to the German men. we should add that it is not only among them that marriage is looked upon as little better than a prolonged term of cohabitation, to which, as soon as either party has occasion to do so, he or she is at perfect liberty to put an end ; for many of the women themselves are no sooner left by their husbands than they fancy they have a perfect right to marry again, even though they are thoroughly convinced that their partner is still living at the time. \"Don't you know,\" said a woman, who was fifty if she was a day, to the female members of our family, \" I am betrothed to the body-servant of the Due de Chartres?\" \"Are jou a widow, then ?\" was the natural inquiry. \" Oh, no ! my husband went away to America thirteen years ago. and I have been betrothed to my next partner for the last nine years.\""], [153, "AFTER MARRIAGE. 137 \" Then doubtlessly you have reason to believe that your hus band died shortly after his arrival in that country ? \" \" Great God, no ! I heard only the other day that he was a major in the Federal army, but I suppose I shall never see him again ; and so I am to be married as soon as my bridegroom quits the Duke's service.\" True, the law enjoins that the man or wife must be absent for ten years, and must be advertised for in the public papers before either party have the right to enter into a fresh marriage contract ; but so httle does this part of the matrimonial institutions of the country appear to be respected or observed, that not one wife, but several, to our knowledge, spoke of re-marrying, as if it were not the least social or moral offence, during the life of their first husband. Another lady, who was what the Germans expressively call, \" a straw-widow,\" that is to say, one whose husband had gone across the Atlantic a few years before, and never written to her afterwards, was determined to try her luck also in the New World, and when asked if she was going thither in the hope of finding her late partner, cried, \" Gott bewahre ! I hope that I shall meet with some old gentle man in want of a housekeeper, and then, maybe, he will take such a fancy to me that we shall be married, and I shall get him to leave me all his money when he dies.\" Such cases, however, we were assured, by our German friends, were exceptional ones ; though so far as we had the means of judging, these exceptional cases and others of a similar nature, seemed to constitute a very extensive rule ; for there appeared to be as little sense of the solemnity of the vows entered into at marriage on the part of the women themselves, as even on the side of the men. But these lax notions as to the sacredness of the marriage contract are a necessary consequence of the laws concerning di vorces in Saxony. In our own country we have acknowledged the principle that such luxuries should not be restricted to the rich, and in the desire to deal with all classes fairly, our legislators have lately instituted a Divorce Court where a man can be utterly absolved from all the vows he made at the altar for a compara tively trifling expense. But in the same spirit of justice let this principle of facile divorceability be carried a step lower, and let the poorer people be admitted to the same rights as have lately"], [154, "138 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. been extended to the middle classes, and were formerly restricted solely to the higher ones. Let it be possible to put an end to all the matrimonial ties, as well as family duties, for the small charge of a few shillings, and upon the most trivial pretexts \u2014 as has long been the case in the legal courts of Saxony \u2014 and as suredly the disclosures concerning the married life of the people of England will soon come to be as hateful and semi-barbarous as the revelations which we have made in the present chapter re specting the matrimonial state, at it at present exists, in the 'Ihuringian capital. The cost of a divorce, in Saxony, we have before incidentally stated, does not exceed 30s. (ten thalers), provided both parties are willing that the marriage between them should be annulled. If, however, there be any opposition on either side, the expenses of course, are considerably increased ; but even then, in a country where lawyers are allowed to charge only twopence for writing a letter, the costs seldom, or never, exceed \u00a310, and are often much less. The pleas upon which divorces are granted are not a little illus trative of the low and degraded feeling of the country. One per son whom we knew, and who, though a clergyman, married his wife merely for the property she possessed, was enabled to obtain the divorce he sought for, when he found that she would not give up to him the capital as well as the interest of her property, solely upon the plea that (as the elegant German phrase runs) \"she stank in her throat,\" or, as we should say, her breath was offen sive. Another gentleman was divorced from his wife, simply because, as he stated in open court, the lady had freckles on her stomach, On the other hand, drunkenness, bad temper, or even ill-treatment are considered to be insufficient grounds for the granting of di vorces, unless both parties are agreeable thereto. If the wife apply to the State to have her marriage annulled on such grounds, and the husband object to forego his claim over the wife's property, then the authorities have no other power but to send a clergyman to the disputants in the hope of bringing about a reconciliation. If, however, this be found impossible, or the cruel treatment to the woman be carried on to an extent that even Germans may think unjustifiable, then a separation from bed and board is granted for one or three years, as the case may be, and renewed as often as found necessary \u2014 the husband being ordered to allow his wife such a maintenance as befits her station in life, and is compatible with his income."], [155, "CHAPTER XV, FROM THE CRADLE I hereby announce that my dear wife was this day safely delivered of a strong healthy boy.

Such is the usual form of announcement that appears in the \"Eisenach Circle Leaf\" (Ereis Blatt) immediately any increase in the population occurs in the Thuringian capital. After the little stranger has been introduced into the family, it is customary for the Frau Thilo (the midwife) to call twice in the course of the day for a fortnight to wash and dress the infant in the morning and evening ; and a lady (who was very communicative upon such matters) assured us that she found this custom very costly also, as she was expected to give the Frau white bread for breakfast, and sausage for supper. This practice continues for a fortnight, after which the services of Madame Thilo are dispensed with, and the mother left to the superintendence of her own infant ; for in two weeks after the birth, the lady is expected to be up and able to take care of it and herself. The advertisements which are usually inserted in the news papers when any addition is made to the population in Germany are so utterly different from the simple announcement of such facts common in our own country \u2014 and, indeed, seem to be prompted by so little delicacy of feeling\u2014 that we should fail in giving the reader a fair estimate of the morals of the country which forms"], [156, "140 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the theme of the present book were we to omit citing one or two more of them here. What English mother would like the following coarse paragraph to be printed in the public papers concerning herself at such a time? The happy delivery of my wife of a healthy girl I hereby announce most respectfully to all participating friends and acquaintances. A. WlTZSCHEL. Eisenach, 15th July, 1862. Immediately after birth, the poor babe is fed, for the first twenty four hours at least, upon herb-tea and sugar water, for it is not allowed to taste a drop of milk during that time ; nor is it permitted to sleep with its mother, or nurse, at night, but is stowed away, generally, in a small clothes-basket, with a pillow for its bed, after the wretched new-born little thing has been wound up in, Heaven knows how many ells of bandages, from the feet right, and tight, up to the neck, as if it were intended to be embalmed as a mummy. In its swaddled state a new-born babe looks as if it were one of the young Caryatides with a human head on a shapeless trunk of stone. For such young babes, neither frocks nor flannel petti coats nor \"blankets\" are ever made \u2014 all the clothing of the new born infant consisting of merely a coarse linen shirt (about as fine as servants'-sheeting with us), the aforesaid bandages, aud a little coloured-cotton jacket ; in which state it is stuffed into a \" Eissen \" (cushion) or \" Steck-bett \" as it is expressively called on the Rhine (literally the bed into which the new-born children are stuck), after the manner of a watch into a watch-pocket, and not half so com fortably as a young kangaroo in the pouch of its mother. These swaddled infants are called in Germany Wickel-kinder. It is usual, among the richer folk of Eisenach, to hand their infants over to be nourished by a wet-nurse ; but among the middle classes, who are unable to afford so unnatural a form of luxury, we believe mothers are generally in the habit of suckling their own offspring. The custom of foster-mothers, however, prevails even with the wives of the beggarly-paid officers of the Saxon army ; though with the very poor people, such as labourers and the like, the children are mostly brought up by hand, owing to the ill-fed condition of the working-classes, and the mothers hav ing mostly \" nothing to give them.\""], [157, "141 FROM THE CRADLE. The swaddling-clothes and nightcaps are continued with infants until they are nearly six months old ; after which the babes are unbandaged and left to crawl about the floor, in merely a chemise and flannel petticoat \u2014 the latter article of attire being fastened over the shoulder to prevent its being soiled \u2014 and without socks or shoes, so that the lower part of the body is entirely naked. This state of barbarism continues up to the first year of the in fant's age ; and at this stage, we have entered the close, musty rooms of well-to-do German folk, and found their baby, who should have been in arms, sprawling on the boards, without either shoes or socks, or anything to cover its lower limbs, and with merely a cold potato in its fist to keep it from crying. A month or six weeks after the birth of every child the christen ing takes place, and this is a ceremony enforced by the laws of the country ; for it is utterly impossible in Protestant tolerant Germany for any person, who may happen to dissent from the forms of the Established religion, to go, as with us, to a public registrar and have the mere name of the child legally inscribed in the official books. True, the Jews resident in each of the German towns are not compelled to conform to the Christian rites ; but then Jews are never elected to fill public offices ; and unless a person can produce a certificate of his christening, and after-confirmation, he is not only considered incapable of holding any situatiou of trust, but the clergyman can refuse even to marry him. Now these legally-enforced christenings (for there is a fine of ten groschens for every day that the ceremony is delayed beyond a month after birth) lead to many peculiar customs in the Thu ringian capital. It is the rule there, that any young woman or man who is newly-confirmed must become sponsor to the child of the first poor person who asks him or her to do so. What may be the penalty on refusal we know not ; but certain it is that no girl or youth ever thinks of denying the request. The common belief among the poor, however, is that if the young person re quested should object to fill the office, the child will either die or grow up sick and weakly ; and as the rich either have faith in, or give way to, the superstition, consent is the usual practice. It is nevertheless by no means necessary that the well-to-do god-parent should accompany the poor child to the altar \u2014 all that is expected being that he or she should pay the expenses consequent upon the christening, and present the child with a cotton frock for the ceremony. The christening expenses for a poor child are 20"], [158, "142 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. groschens (2s.), besides 15 groschens (Is. Gd.) to the nurse who carries the babe ; and the payment of these sums after all con stitutes the great charm in the eyes of the poorer classes. Such an institution may be of use as the means of uniting the poor with the rich, but that it has no rehgious object with it is de monstrated by the fact that godmotherhood in Germany, as with us, is considered chiefly as a social tie, and one which enjoins the giving of certain presents at certain seasons to the godchild, rather than the superintendence of its moral and religious education. This same deodand holds good in Germany to the present day \u2014 silver spoons forming the staple presents at the time of the chris tening. The Germans, however, seem to believe that their spon sorial duties do not utterly end here, for it is customary in Saxony to present the young godchild with a new suit the first Christmas after its birth. On the day of the ceremony the godfather is expected to send the godmother a pair of white kid gloves and a bouquet. The christening is usually performed late in the afternoon, and at the conclusion of it, the parents retire with the sponsors home, to an early evening meal of coffee, cake, sausage, Sauer-kraut, and salad \u2014 a feast being always given on such occasions, to which a num ber of friends are invited, and drinking and riot generally prevail ing till a late hour at night. Previous to confirmation the neophyte has to betake himself, or herself, for an hour after school-time twice every week, at the beginning of his or her course of religious instruction, to the school at which the clergyman attends ; and for an hour every day for the last quarter of the year previous to their examination. This is called the \" Gebet-stunde \" (literally the prayer-lesson), and some have to attend it for two or three years before being con firmed. During the last year of their probation the young people are expected to be of particularly-staid and solemn demeanour ; they are to indulge in no games nor sports, and, indeed, to abstain from all kinds of amusements whatever. Immediately after the final examination by the clergyman has been passed, and they are thought fit for confirmation, they are directed by the Pfarrer to go round to all their friends, the day before the ceremony, and say to each of thein \" If ever I have done thee any wrong, I humbly crave thy forgiveness.\" It is usual at such times for the friends visited to give the young people not only their blessing but a few groschens, or some other present, into the bargain. At"], [159, "FROM THE CRADLE. 143 the time of confirmation the godfather and godmother are ex pected to present their sponse child rath something either in gold or silver, To boys watches are usually given, whilst brooches and cuff-buttons are the ordinary presents made to girls. Moreover, when any of the godchildren are about to be mar ried, the custom prevails for the sponsors to sond them certain articles of plate or furniture \u2014 such as tea or table spoons, or may be a work-table of the more expensive woods. One young lady we heard of having two and a half dozen silver spoons presented to her by her collective godfathers and godmothers at such a time. Again, we were assured that it is customary for the godfather and godmother to send their married goddaughter a silver spoon with her name engraven upon it, at the birth of every child. Every fortnight throughout the year the christenings are pub lished in the baby's-pocket-handkerchief of a newspaper, which appeal's four times a week in the Thuringian capital. Such announcements usually run as follows ; \u2014 Child Baptisms. Gottlieb the Httle son of Master-Cabinet-Maker, Christian Prellert. Margaretta, the httle daughter of Master-Tailor, Nicholaus Windbeutel. Magdalena, the illegitimate child of Frederika Wenig. Such announcements as the last here given are by no means unusual in the Eisenach newspapers ; for though the town num bers but 1 3,000 inhabitants, we were credibly informed that there was scarcely an unmarried servant maid or work-girl in the place who had not had one or two children."], [160, "CHAPTER XVI. TO THE GRAVE. There would appear to be three classes of doctors in Saxony, of which it is impossible to cite the precise equivalent in England, and for each of which there is a distinct and special examination before the members are permitted to practise either of the three forms of healing. The first is that appertaining to physicians and surgeons proper ; for no distinction is made in Saxony be tween surgery and physic ; and for this class, so far as we could understand, a most rigid examination is required, though, as a general rule, it seemed to us that the members of the German medical profession were as far behind the English ones, both in knowledge and gentlemanly bearing, as the German clergymen, who are mostly the sons of peasant-farmers, are diverse from our own curates and rectors. The healing art, indeed, in Saxony appears to be in about the same state as it was with us some hundred years ago. Herbalism, and curing by sympathy, and even by touch, are the vulgar notions of the community on such matters, and the apothecaries are about as learned as to the com pounding of chemicals as a French saltimbanque, and about as closely allied to educated gentlemen too ; for in the town in which we lived there were two such worthies, one styling himself the \"Palace Druggist,\" and the other the \"Privileged Palace Druggist,\" the greater part of whose chemical processes consisted in the dispensation of farthingsworth of hair oil, in the manufac ture of fly-papers, and the concoction of peppermint drops. The second class of medical men in Saxony consists of what are called Wund-artzen (wound-doctors), that is to say, those who are entitled to practise the external rather than the internal arts of healing. The examination required for such persons is such as is enjoined for military bone-setters, as contradistinguished"], [161, "TO THE GRAVE. 145 from army-surgeons or physicians proper. Such medical gentry can hardly be allied with the enlightened medical men of our own country. In character and manners they approximate to the better class of English \" cattle doctors ;\" and though they are legally qualified to amputate limbs, when we tell the reader that their fee for cutting off a leg is but fifteen shillings, English folk will readily understand how with such means of keeping pace with the knowledge and enlightenment of Europe, they cannot possibly be said to bear the least semblance to the gentlemen-surgeons of our own land. The third class of so-called medical men in Saxony has long ago died out in England. These are \" barber-chirurgeons,\" of whose existence the striped poles hung out at our cheap hair dressers' shops are the only signs left among us. In Saxony, however, these barber-surgeons flourish to the present day, and seem to the English mind as if they were the vivified fossils of some antediluvian order of creation ; for in Eisenach, before a man is legally allowed to mow your chin of its daily bristles, he has to pass an examination before the \" Ministerium \" at Weimar, to prove his capability of taking up arteries, to show his anatomi cal knowledge of the precise locality of the veins he has to puncture, to make known his fitness, indeed, for applying leeches, putting on blisters, cupping and bone-setting, as well as administering to cases of suspended animation, such as hanging, drowning, &c. Further, the barber-surgeon of Germany, is allowed to practise even in cases of poisoning. True, he is permitted by law to give merely milk, whenever any deleterious drug has been swallowed, and is bound to call in a physician in cases of emergency ; still, from the instances above cited, it will be seen how far the Ger mans lag behind the knowledge of enlightened Europe ; and when we assure the reader that every such barber-surgeon has to pay, on an average, from 300 to 400 thalers, i. e. from \u00a345 to \u00a360 sterling, to the State, before he is allowed to practise his simple art, the quick-witted Englishman will readily understand how political revenue is enriched at the expense of the enlightenment and proper treatment of the people. A curious custom prevails in Thuringia in connection with the employment of medical men, and one which holds good with us solely in the administration of quack medicines. We all remem ber how the Earl of Aldborough was made, day after day, to re turn thanks in the public newspapers to \" Professor \" Holloway for some wonderful cure wrought either by bis miraculous pills, 10"], [162, "146 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. or ointment, as the case might be. But, though such are the practices of unqualified \"quack-salvers\" who have no other means of making their way in England, what would the enlightened portion of our countrvmen think, if the medical gentlemen allowed their patients to insert, in the public journals, high-flown puffs as to the cures they had wrought upon them ? Such an unbecoming custom, however, prevails in Thuringia ; and over and over again iii the course of each quarter, one meets with such announcements as the following : \u2014 For the-so-severe-and-life-dangerou3,-but-under-God's-by-standing,-hap pily-aceomplished,-and.completely-suceessful Neck-operation performed on our daughter, say we to the gentlemen Dr. Mattheus and Dr. Grebner, our heartiest thanks. Under the skilful hands of the same gentlemen was to us a sixteen-year-old daughter preserved. We feel ourselves, however, bound in duty, the before-named gentlemen, not alone as skilful operators, but above all, as very friendly, sympathising, and trustworthy doctors to our suffering fellow creatures to recommend. May God grant that these gentlemen in similar calamities such fortunate helpers may be. Stedfeldt, 30th June, 1862. The Teacher-family Hill. In Saxony the physicians seem to glory in the puffery of news paper advertisements, with the view of extending their sixpenuy fees ; for it is obvious that if they objected to such beslavering paragraphs as that which we have given above, or the one which we now subjoin, such paltry means of feehunting must in a few years be utterly unknown in the land. For the-under-God's-by-standing-so-happily-accomplished operation on my wife, hold I myself, in the name of the Almightv, bound in duty to the gentlemen Physicians, Dr. Witthauer, Dr. Mattheus, and Dr. Grebner, hereby openly, by hearty thanks, to outspeak. May these gentlemen for a long and strong life be preserved, so that on suffering mankind their help may be showered. Not less, however, do we thank also our honoured fellow-citizens, of every standing in society, for the-in-all-possible-ways-shown-to-us great part taking in our sorrow, with the inmost wish that Heaven will every-one and all from a like fate shield and forefend. Eisenach, 2Sth July, 1S62. G. C. Baedoef. Before treating of the customs peculiar at death, in Saxony, we should here mention a practice of which, as it is utterly un-"], [163, "TO THE GRAVE. 147 known in our country, it may be as well to show the working. Among the Thuringian peasants, and often, so far as we could' learn, among the citizens of the towns, it is the mode with fathers, and indeed with mothers, when they have arrived at an age which unfits them for the cares of the world, to make over their entire property to their children, and as no law of primogeniture exists in Saxony, this is usually carried out by dividing their possessions, whether real or personal, in common among the members of the family. The division is made under a regular legal form, recog nized by the State, and by which a certain yearly sum out of the interest of the capital is reserved to the parents ; such sum being termed Alimentations-geld, or in other words \"living money.\" The interest is generally paid by the members of the family on the birthday of the parent, the custom being for the children to bring the amount in new, bright, silver thalers. These are placed in a basket covered with fresh flowers, and carried to the dwelling of the parent, where a coffee-drinking of the entire family is held, and large cakes baked to celebrate the occasion. Such is the usual mode of proceeding with what are termed \" united families \" \u2014 that is to say, with those rare exceptions where the several members remain in peace and concord with their parents after such a division of property has been made among the chil dren. In all fairness, we should add that during our stay in the Thuringian capital one or two such cases came under our personal observation. Similar instances, however, we regret to say, are like angels' visits \u2014 \" very few and far between.\" For the history of humanity it would be well that such a pro vision led to good results ; but from the best information we could obtain upon the subject, we must confess that the custom seems to be fraught with greater evils than benefits. For as a rule (to which we have above quoted a few honourable exceptions), no sooner is such a deed sigued, and the entire wealth of the parents made over to the children, than the young folk begin to see there is no hope of reward by good conduct towards their old father and mother ; and proceed to treat them consequently with the greatest possible disrespect, if not cruelty. Over and over again have we heard of processes in the Justice-house by fathers against the children, who had so wronged them ; and we have before cited the case of the mother of a Master- Tanner who had to take legal proceedings against her son (after she had assigned to him the entire business on his marriage), in order to obtain ten gros chens, or a shilling a day, as the expense of her maintenance ;"], [164, "148 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. while the ingrate wretch went round about the beer-houses ex claiming against the extortion, and scoffing at the idea of having to pay his old mother two thalers ten groschens (or seven shillings weekly), when, as he said, \" God in Heaven knew, it cost him and his wife but a thaler (or three shillings) a-head every week for their food.\" If there be a time at which the public ostentation of grief is more hateful than at another, surely it is at that solemn period when some poor soul goes to its last account ; and every decent minded person knows that at such moments the heart grows na turally dumb with the overpowering weight of the blow that has fallen upon it. Consequently, although we may be touched, at the first time of perusal, by the peculiarity of the death-announce ments in Saxony, and have our sympathies roused by the novelty and force of the phraseology used upon such occasions, we come at length to sicken over these same strong phrases of ostentatious anguish ; and to wonder why people cannot retire to their closet to weep and pray, rather than do so, at so much per hne, in the advertising pages of a publio journal ; as for instance, \u2014 To those sharing in our sorrow we dedicate the mourning intelligence hereby-made-known that our inwardly-beloved little son August, after nine teen weeks long of sickbed (Krankenlager) suffering, this day to a better afterstato was called away. With a prayer for the comfort of condolence. Eisenach, 28th October, 1862. Th. Nicolat and Wife. This, however, is one of the simplest examples, culled from the farthing newspaper of Eisenach ; and we, therefore, subjoin another, which is rather more intense, both in its parade of re ligion and grief. God the Almighty hath been pleased (hat es gefallen) in His wisdom our good and-most-heartily-beloved daughter and sister Henriette, this morn ing, at 1 o'clock, in the 20i year of her age, to call away to a hetter life. Nothing but the hope of an after-meeting can, in our deep anguish for this Iosb, comfort us. To relatives and friends we announce this grief-event (Trauer-fall) with a prayer for their assuasive part-taking in it. Volkershausen, 14th December, 1862. Official Accountant, Weber and Family. The English reader to whom such announcements may be"], [165, "149 TO THE GRAVE. new, may perhaps be impressed with the solemnity of the terms, and think we are unjust in attributing anything like hollowness to the parade. But when we assure our countrymen that such announcements, in which the most absorbing grief is set forth, are often immediately followed by others from the nearest rela tive, in which the public are assured that the business of the dear deceased will be carried on by the next of kin, who \" trusts to merit a continuance of those favours,'' &c., and \" begs to assure the nobility and gentry, he is ready to sell at the lowest possible prices, as well as to defy all competition \" \u2014 surely such indecent puffery at such a moment will open the eyes, and make others see that the death-announcements themselves are but the most hateful kinds of public affectation. Here is such an instance, and by no means an unfrequent one, in this land of paraded sorrow. To those taking part in our sorrow we dedicate the painful announce ment that our good Father and Father-in-law the Grocer, J. G. Brandt, last night at 12i softly slept his life away. Eisenach, 2nd November, 1862. Those left behind. Hereby make I the respectful announcement that I the management of my dead Father-in-law's drysalter's and lottery business shall carry on, from to-morrow morning, upon my own and sole account ; and under the Firm hitherto known as J. G. Bbandt it will still be continued. And here another : For the many proofs of confidence shown to the dead best thanks. I beg such may also be extended to me in the business I am about to con duct, for I shall always be anxious the same to merit. Hermann Budeensieg. We have now done with all the customs up to the time of death in Saxony ; and come in due order to treat of the death obsequies themselves. It is usual at the last moments of the poor (and far more customary than among the rich), for the people to send for the clergyman and have the \" holy evening-meal \" as it is called in Thuringia (or the sacrament of Holy Unction as the Catholics term it), administered to them. This costs but one penny, ac cording to the tariff of the country ; comparatively larger sums,"], [166, "150 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. however, are given, in proportion to the means of the individuals. There is a simple superstition among the people of the land, that upon the administration of this final sacrament the patient must either die or recover; and it is plain to the commonest logician that upon the horns of such a dilemma the fate of every person must depend. One simple girl told us that she knew of a person whom she had seen with her own eyes at the point of death in the Eisenach hospital, and who revived immediately after the admi nistration of the moribund rites. All we can say is \" God bless her for her faith ! \" and we are perfectly assured that it was this self-same faith of the dying man which made him \u2014 as when Christ himself touched the sick \u2014 whole for the time being. Immediately after death the bodies are washed and laid out by the \" Todten Frau\" (death-woman), whose perquisite it is to claim every white cloth about the body, at the time of decease. These would appear to be the gains of such carrion folk in every land ; though people who trouble their head about the why and the wherefore of each national custom cannot help wondering why the self-same practices should prevail in countries so far removed from one another. Xo sooner does a death occur in Saxe Weimar than the infor mation is sent to the \" Leichen Bestatter\" (official undertaker, there being no private ones to plunder the relatives in Saxony), and he orders the removal of the corpse from the house of the family to the dead-house of the city at eleven o'clock in the night of the day on which the death has occurred. At that hour two men come to the house, bearing a long basket and lantern. The basket is half filled with hay, and in this the body, wrapped in a sheet, is placed with a pillow beneath the head, and so borne to the Todten-Haus (dead-house) adjoining the cemetery. Those persons who are so disposed may object to the immediate removal of the dead body, and cause it to remain for three days in the home in which the death took place. As, however, it costs a greater sum of money to be buried from the house of the family, than it does from the dead-house in connection with the cemetery, such au expensive practice is indulged in merely by the well-to do. It is far more usual, therefore, for the body to be borne away to the dead-house on the same evening as the death occurs. A basket of wood and twigs, as well as sufficient oil to keep a lamp alight during the nights till the time of interment, is like wise sent with the corpse ; for it is the custom in this same super stitious land, not only to keep a lamp aud a fire burning in the"], [167, "151 TO THE GRAVE. dead-house up to the day of burial, but to place a ring on the thumb of the dead person's hand, so that, if there be the least chance of returning life, the bell may be wrung to warn the atten dant, who is ever on the watch. In this basket of hay, with a pillow under the head, the corpse remains until within an hour or two of the time appointed for the burial. Day by day the doctor, elected by the town for the pur pose, calls at the dead-house to satisfy himself that the signs of corporeal decomposition are duly taking place ; and when he has declared that the body is irrevocably dead, the decoration of the corpse begins after the fashion of the country. Then the \" Todteu Frau\" (death-woman) proceeds to'dress the body in the best possible costume to which the person has been accustomed during life. Women at such times are occasionally attired in white dresses, with a wreath upon their head, and others, of the poorer classes, have black gowns and shoes and stockings ; while the men are laid out in coat, trousers, cravat, boots, and white gloves. In one case, a gilt lyre was placed upon the breast, and a laurel wreath upon the head, to indicate the musical genius of the deceased. Even after the corpse has been \" geputztf as it is called, no coffin can be fastened down till the medical authority has certified that the body is fit for inter ment. Moreover, it is the custom for friends at such times to send garlands and flowers for the covering of the body, during the time that the coffin is left open for the inspection of the public, as it generally is, for au hour or two previous to the burial ceremony. On the occasion of a funeral, it is curious to hear the comments of the crowd, as they keep bobbing in and out of the dead-house, concerning the appearance of the corpse about to be consigned to its last home. \" Oh ! \" says one woman, \" it is wunder-schone\" (wonderfully beautiful) : \" she is dressed in a cap with pink ribbons, and has a whole coffinful of flower-blossoms, and a bouquet in her hand, I declare.\" Then, if it happen to be a man high in the State, you are in formed as to how many orders he has on his breast, and so forth. After the public have been admitted to view the decorated corpse at the dead-house, the garlands sent by the friends are taken from the interior of the coffin and placed on the pall outside of it. Then comes the strange questim, as to who is to bear the body"], [168, "152 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to the grave ? If the dead person had happened to belong to any of the \" Ziinften\" (that is to say, to any of the trades' corporations attached to the town), it is the peculiar privilege of the members of such Guild to carry the corpse to the ground. If, however, he were a burgher in connection with no particular incorporated trade, then it is customary to employ the tailors for the office ; for these people, say the citizens, are the most decent-looking among the working class. For such duties the price usually paid is fifteen groschens (one-and-sixpence) each bearer. Moreover, previous to the performance of the ceremony, the coffin-bearers are allowed to assemble at the house of the dead person, and there to be treated to schnapps and white bread as a means for fitting them for the labour. In the olden time it was customary for the Thuringian people to expend large sums of money upon burial ceremonies ; but from the beginning of the present century it has been for bidden (for Saxon Governments must interfere in matters with which they have no possible moral or political right to meddle) for any person to give any funereal feast, or indeed for any one class to have a different coffin from another. Another odd custom with these coffin-bearers is, that.when young people are carried to the grave by the friends of the family, and they are unwilling to receive any remuneration for the office, they are each presented with a lemon, decked with a sprig of rosemary, with the name of the dead person made out in black pins stuck into the rind of the fruit. This custom prevails at the present day mostly with old fashioned people ; and it is usual for the bearers to cast the funereal citrons into the grave previous to the filling of it up. The symbol of the rosemary is, in a measure patent, but why a lemon should be given at such times, we cannot possibly conceive \u2014 especially in a country to which the lime-tree is certainly not indigenous. The coffins ordained by the State (for the State, you see, must have a finger in everything) are always kept in stock at the dead house of the cemetery. They are made of the rudest possible materials, and cost, upon an average, from 2 to 3 thalers (6s. \u2014 9s.) according to size ; and each of the carpenters and cabinet-makers take it in turn to supply the deficiencies as they occur, so that one or two of the different sizes may be always ready. Such jobs are considered as the best work that a master wood-worker can meet with, seeing that he can entrust the making of them to his appren tices, and the deal boards out of which the coffins are made cost little or nothing."], [169, "TO THE GRAVE. 153 The expenses of funerals in Saxony are trifling when compared with those of our own country. A poor person can be decently interred for 3 thalers, or 9s., and the richest burial hardly ever costs more than 35 thalers, or 51. Sis. English. The cemetery belongs to the Stadt (town), and every inhabitant of the city has the right of being interred there for thirty years free of cost. Such things as fosses communes for the poor are utterly unknown in the land. The digging of the grave is the sole expense that falls upon the relatives, and this costs 20 groschens (2s.) ; whilst, if the friends of the dead wish to buy the ground for perpetuity, the cost is but 10 thalers, or 11. 10s. of our money 4 for the fee sjmple. Among the poor of Thuringia the practice of subscribing to the Eranken-und-Sterbe Kasse (literally, the \" Sickness and Death Fund\") commonly prevails. The cost of this is 15 pfennings (l%d.) a week for those who wish to insure a thaler a week for twelve weeks during illness, and 23 thalers (M. ) to the family of the insured person, at time of death. One-half of the sum given has to be expended in the cost of burial, and the other either in mourning or as the relatives please. If, however, a person be so poor that his relatives cannot afford to pay for the expense of his being carried to the grave by the members of the Trade Corporations, the coffin is wheeled thither in a barrow ; whilst if the wretched creature dies in the poor house, and the friends are so badly off that they cannot afford even the expense of a coffin, the body is sent to the University at Jena, there to be dissected by the medical students. lt is by no means pleasant to live in a small German town ; for not only are you sure to hear of each death that occurs in the city, but the town-bell seems to ring out its knell in the afternoon of almost every day of the year. In London, where a death occurs every minute of every day, the student hardly hears the bell, tolling for the many funerals that are for ever going on about him. In httle Eisenach, however, which is hardly bigger than the smallest metropolitan parish, the booming of the funereal notes seems to float through the air after almost every midday-meal ; and yet the city-bell is tolled only when some \" respectable\" corpse is about to be interred, seeing that it costs, for dead citizens to be honoured in such a manner, a couple of shillings, and for gentle folks to have a longer and louder peal, not less than a thaler.

The consequence is, that as such head-coverings are seldom used, a person requires but one in the course of his life ; and indeed, the self-same hat passes from father to son as though it were some specially revered heir loom of the family. At these Saxon funerals, therefore, the stranger is astonished at seeing such an assortment of hats as he never before witnessed in the course of his life. They are of all manner of antiquated shapes, and of finely-graduated shades of rustiness. You can almost trace the history of the fashions in such articles of attire, as you look upon the different odd forms of the hats there congregated. Some are as tall and perfectly cylindrical as though they were black chimney-pots worn on the head, and many are much bigger at the crown than the rim, looking more like black truncated funnels than chapeaux of the present day. Almost all are either too small or too large for the wearers ; some brims reaching down to the eye-brows, and others being perched on the very top of the forehead. But such is the mania among the Germans for hat-wearing only on special occasions, that you have but to look out of your window and see the people \u2014 one and all \u2014 gentlefolks and journeymen \u2014 disfigured by their old-fashioned and rusty-looking \" beavers\" to know that something is astir: either a death, a christening, or a marriage, as the case may be. The services performed at interments are of different kinds, according to the means of the family of the deceased. The usual custom is, with those who can afford to pay the clergyman for his rhetoric, to have a speech pronounced over the grave \u2014 the length of such speech and the compliments paid to the departed, de pending solely upon the amount of money which the Pfarrer re ceives. For a funeral oration about five minutes long, 10 groschens, or Is., is usually given ; and for one a quarter of an hour in length, 1 thaler 12 groschens, (or 4s. 2rf.) is the cost, according to the clerical tariff of the country. But for a speech that extends over thirty minutes at least, and in which the virtues of the deceased are painted in the most vivid and glowing colours, the Minister of the Gospel expects to receive not less than 2 thalers"], [171, "TO THE GRAVE. 155 25 groschens, or 8s. Gd. English ; whereas, if the holy man is to receive nothing for his duties at the grave, he mumbles but the shortest possible prayer over the poor corpse, and then retires with the greatest possible alacrity \u2014 to the beer-house. After the burial service it is usual for each of the relatives and friends to cast a handful of earth on the coffin \u2014 the grave being generally lined with green branches of fir, and the body lowered into it by (what strikes the foreigner as the most hideous part of the ceremony) female attendants. We have before cited samples of the inflated advertisements which it is usual to insert in the newspapers at the time of death in Saxony. Some persons, however, defer advertising until after the funeral has taken place, for then hardly any one omits to ex press his thanks publicly to all who have taken part in the cere mony \u2014 from the minister to the coffin-bearers \u2014 as well as to those who bring flowers to decorate the coffin \u2014 and even, in some instances, down to the idle crowd of spectators who generally throng to such scenes, when they hear that the burial is likely to be a grand one. The first example, given below, is the advertisement of a widow, who, it will be seen, has a good eye to business, even through her tears : While t to all those that to his last resting-place accompanied my hus band, who on the 3rd of this month quitted this earth for a better existence, and particularly to the honored gentlemen of the shooting company who carried him to the grave, as well as to Mr. Superintendent Vollenhaupt for his consolatory words spoken at the.burial of the deceased \u2014 while I to these, in this way, my heartiest thanks out-speak, I pledge myself hereby at the 6ame time\" that it is my intention the tavern business of ray sainted husband to carry on.

In Thuringia it is usual to visit the grave always on the anni versary of the death, when, even the very poor manage to afford 2d for the purchase of a fresh garland to hang upon the cross, or strew upon the green mound of earth covering their lost relative ; aud we never visited the \" God's-acre \" (as the Germans finely call the burial-ground) of Eisenach without being moved by the sight of the different tints of these same garlands, telling one how long the departed friends had been treasured in the memories of the living. Moreover, when we lived at a house on the Schloss berg (castle-hill, overlooking the cemetery), morning after morning we used to see a poor woman visit that part of the ground appro priated to the interment of children, and there throw herself upon her knees, to breathe a prayer that she and her little one might meet once more in heaven."], [174, "CHAPTER XVII. THE SCHOOLS OF EISENACH. Let us now proceed to specify the number and kind of schools to be found in the capital of Thuringia at the present time. Such schools may be conveniently grouped into three classes \u2014 \u25a0 i. c. those appertaining to the State, to the city, or to private in- dividuals. These, however, require to be severally distinguished according as they are intended for young men, for boys, for girls, or for mere children. The young men's schools are \u2014 first, the forest-school, or rather college, at which the youth's to whose care the culture of the woods is afterwards to be entrusted, are in- structed in all the branches of science directly or indirectly con- nected with enlightened arboriculture, and of which institution a more detailed account is given hereafter; and, secondly, the Seminarists' Schule, as it is termed, or that designed for the com- pletion of the education of such youths as purpose to become the future schoolmasters in the towns and villages of the district; the special course of instruction at the latter institution being of three kinds, \u2014 (1.) Pedagogic, wherein the embryo teacher is impressed with a sense of the business, manner, and character of the school- master proper, as well as of his relations to the pupil, and the tie which should exist between the pupil and himself; (2.) Methodic, in which he is made acquainted with the different modes of in- struction, and the excellences or defects of each \u2014 such as the systems of Pestalozzi, Rousseau, and others; and (3.) Catechetic, or that in which he is instructed as to the best means of examin- ing pupils by the mode of question and answer as to their profi- ciency in the matters taught. Before entering either of these schools, the student has to pass a certain examination at some subordinate public academy, where the course of instruction is designed to prepare him for the due"], [175, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 159 understanding of those higher forms of learning which are to be brought under his cognizance at the more erudite institution. For the student at the forest-school, a certificate of qualification from either of the State- (grammar-) schools is considered to be sufficient ; for the pedagogic aspirant it is necessary that he should have a voucher as to having \" passed \" through the several branches of study at the \" Sekundar Schule,\" or, literally, the school where the instruction is specially made secondary to that of the Semi narists' institution. Nor are these the only examinations requi site before either class of aspirants are thought competent to fol low the vocation for which they are intended. For as the \"forest practitioner \" (so the student at the forest-school is styled) has to prove his fitness for the care and culture of the woods by submit ting to another such inquiry previous to becoming even a \" forest assistant,\" and to a third and more stringent catechizing ere he can rise to the dignity of a forester-proper ; so the would-be peda gogue must, at the end of his schooling at the Seminarists' insti tution, give proof of his qualification for the office of a public in structor by obtaining a pass from the examiners instituted for the purpose. But even then he is considered fit to practise only as an assistant teacher ; and, after two years' probation at this branch of the business, he has to go through a third examination in order to obtain his diploma, as it were, to entitle him to pursue the vocation of a regular preceptor. The course of instruction at the forest-school costs but \u00a37 10s. per annum, whilst that at the Seminarists' Institution is free. In this latter respect \u2014 in the care taken, as well as the facilities given, in order to obtain a class of preceptors at once naturally and educationally fitted for the task, by making the office open to any one who is disposed to qualify himself for the discharge of its duties, it must be confessed the Germans are far ahead of our own countrymen ; but it is in this scholastic element that the trueg enius of Germany lies. As to the matters taught at the several schools of the Thuringian capital, the students at the Seminarists' Institution are instructed not only in the subjects specially requisite for their future calling, but have also lessons given to them upon the organ, violin, piano, and in thorough bass ! The reason of this musical education being superadded to the other is because the schoolmasters of the several villages throughout Germany, are Ukewise the Cantors, or directors of the music, at the various village-churches. Hence, by the uniou of the two offices, an extra good is attained, \u2014 the children at even"], [176, "160 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the smallest and most remote rural schools being taught singing by one who is an educated musician. And thus a love of one of the most innocent, the most exquisite, and, at the same time, the most inexpensive of worldly pleasures, comes to be diffused syste matically throughout the country ; so that even those who are denied the means of participating in the more costly of human enjoyments have a resource of refined delight opened up to them to which our agricultural labourers, or the working population even of our cities, are utter strangers. The other schools for young men are those for apprentices, These, like the Seminarists' Institution,- are, very wisely and mu nificently, ma.de free. They are of two kinds : the \"free working man's-school\" (frei Gewerke-schule) and the \"free Sunday-school,\" which is for working men also. The former is held at the Gym nasium thrice a-week ; on Monday and Friday afternoons from oue to three, and from six to eight ; and on every Sunday from seven till nine in the morning, and from one till three in the afternoon. An examination has to be undergone before entering this institution, as a proof of the proficiency of the pupd, in writ ing and the first rules of arithmetic (the \" four species \" as the Germans call them) ; after which the young workman is instructed in Mathematics, Geometry, Drawing, Perspective, and in design ing plans, as well as in the principles of construction and projec tion. Either to this, or to the free Sunday-school, every appren tice was, up to the beginning of 1863, bound by law to go from fourteen to eighteen years of age ; for he could not become a journeyman until he had obtained a good certificate from the teachers. But though the recent introduction of free trade has put an end to the compulsory part of the education, the free workman 's-school still numbers as many as eighty pupils, to whom there are four teachers, receiving from \u00a3'21 down to \u00a37 10s. each per annum. At the Free Sunday-school, on the other hand, no such preli minary examination of the pupils either was or is required ; and thither all such apprentices were wont to betake themselves as were either unprepared for the scrutiny, or disinclined to avail themselves of the higher education, at the other schools for arti sans. At the Sunday-school, writing, reading, reckoning, and book-keeping, as well as religion, and natural philosophy, are taught from seven till nine every Sunday morning ; and though no examination was formerly required of the pupil on his entry here, every apprentice was bound to pass an examination in such"], [177, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH 161 matters, before leaving the school or before being entitled either to take rank or receive wages as a \"journeyman.\" Since the aboli- tion of this law the free Sunday-school has declined rapidly ; for whereas up to February in the present year there were as many as forty-five scholars in the second class alone, the number, since that date, has dwindled down to twelve ; whilst the decrease in the first and third classes has been in nearly the same proportion. In the words of one of the teachers to us, \" the masters and the apprentices mistake Gewerbe-freiheit (liberty in trading) withLe/ir freiheit (liberty in learning), so that master- tradesmen prefer, now that they are permitted to do so, to keep their apprentices in the shop working for them rather than to send them to the school to study for themselves.\" At the Sunday-school there are now only thirty-two scholars altogether, and to these there are three teach- ers, each in the receipt of 40 thalers (\u00a36) per annum. For common labourers or unskilled workmen, there is no free school whatever ; nor are they in the habit of attending any scho- lastic institution, other than the city academies, and that only till they are fourteen years of age. Of the school for boys, on the other hand \u2014 rather than for young men \u2014 there are three different kinds in Eisenach : the State Schools, the City Schools, and private schools. The State Schools are almost equivalent to what we term Gram- mar Schools. Of these there are two, called respectively, the Gymnasium and the Real-gymnasium ; the one being more nomi- nalistic in its character, dealing with words and languages rather than things ; and the other principally realistic in its objects, attending more to the study of things than the words which stand for them. The Gymnasium proper is formed upon the basis of the old St. George's School, instituted by the Franciscan monks in the thirteenth century, and at which Martin Luther studied while a currend-boy in Eisenach. At the beginning of the last \" year-hundred,\" however, the old monastic institution was formed into a Gymnasium, or \" Seminarium Theologicum,\" and still further expanded by the late Grand-duke Karl Fiiedrich, whose name it now bears. The Beal-Gymnstsium, on the contrary, is a comparatively-new institution, having been founded only as re cently as 1848, in accordance with the growing impression that the old classical schools are hardly adapted to the scientific cha racter of the age in which we live. It was, therefore, established with the view of teaching youths more science and less Latin and Greek than they had previously been in the habit of learning."], [178, "162 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. At the Gymnasium proper the course of instruction consists of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, German, and French ; reckoning and or namental writing ; mathematics, physics, natural history, and geo graphy ; religion and biblical history ; besides ancient and modern history, elocution, and singing. At the JR<?\u00ab\u00a3-Gynmasiuni, on the other hand, the education com prises Latin, German, French, and English ; reckoning and or namental writing ; mathematics, natural philosophy, chemistry, natural history, and geography ; religion ; history, ancient and modern ; as well as drawing, singing, and gymnastic exercises. Both of those schools bear a high reputation, and we find, on reference to the last year's report of the Beal-schule that no less than twenty-five per cent, of the scholars there are from distant places, some coming from France, and others from our own country ; aud no wonder, since the cost of the education at this institution is but \u00a32 5s. per annum, while that at the Gymnasium proper ranges from \u00a31 16s. to \u00a32 8s. the year; both of them being what are called day-schools, and the scholars having to board and lodge at some house in the town. The average expense of such board and lodging, however, may be taken at 12 thalers the month, or 144 thalers (\u00a321 12s.) the year; so that a really good education may be obtained at either of these institutions for even a less sum than is charged at the cheapest \" do-the-boys hall \" in England. It should be borne in mind that, for the price above given, the board and lodging can hardly be expected to ap proximate to the ordinary English character ; and to give our countrymen an idea of what the living is likely to consist of, at the price above-named, we will here append the dietary table given in the prospectus of Fraulein Moder's establishment, which is one of the principal boarding-schoolsjfbr young ladies in Eisenach: \" First Breakfast, at half-past 6 o'clock, consisting of coffee (probably without milk or sugar), or milk, and white bread (the latter without butter). Second Breakfast, at 9 o'clock. \u2014 One or two slices of black bread and butter, or of black bread and fruit. Dinner, at half-past 12 o'clock; consisting of soup, vegetables, and either bouilli or roast meat. This is changed at regular in tervals for \" meal-eating \" (Mehlspeiscn ) \u2014 such as light puddings, dumplings, or milk-soups \u2014 with preserves\u2014 but without any meat or vegetables at such times. Afternoon Meal, at half-past 4.\u2014 Again black bread and butter, or black bread and fruit."], [179, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 163 Supper, at 7 o'clock ; consisting of tea or soup, with black bread and butter, or light meat-eating (leichten Fleischspeisen). At this school \u2014 which, we repeat, is the principal institution for young ladies in the town, and where there are some ten or twelve English girls, the charge for education and boarding is 200 thalers (\u00a330) per annum, with 10 thalers (\u00a31 10s ) extra if the boarder remain at the school during the four weeks holidays at Midsummer. This, however, is the price for Germans ; whilst the tariff for the English is raised to 300 thalers (or \u00a345), but whether in considera tion of a more generous diet, we cannot say. We should add, however, in all fairness, that the institution was very favourable spoken of; and we know, from our own experience, that tho mistress was as highly esteemed by her pupils as her system of education was praised by the Professors in the town. Judging by the number of scholars, the .RtW-school appears to be the most popular institution of the two ; for as the original Gymnasium is said to have had, some twenty years ago, more than double its present number of scholars, it will be seen bj- the before-mentioned table that the new Gymnasium, though not yet fifteen years old, has now upwards of twenty-one per cent, more pupils than its more classical rival. But, though the number of scholars at the ancient institution have declined, the number of its professors and teachers still remains the same as when there were twice as many boys to teach ; because, it is said, the charter of its foundation expressly enjoins the maintenance of such an educational staff; so that thus we have the monstrous anomaly of not less than 13 teachers at the one institution for the instruc tion of only 108 scholars, and but 8 professors at the other for as many as 131 boys. Such are the State Schools of Eisenach ; those, on the other hand, belonging to the city are of three kinds, though all are incorporated in one and the same institution. (1.) The Sekundar Schule, as it is called, or literally that which, as we have before explained, is intended to serve as a secondary establishment to the Seminarist Institution, or, in other words, to act as a prepara tory school to it; (2.) the first Citizens '-school ; and (3.) the second Citizens'-school. At the secondary school the course of instruction consists of German grammar, composition and elocution ; arithmetic and ornamental writing ; geometry, natural philosophy, and chemistry ; natural history and geography ; religion and biblical history ;"], [180, "164 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. ancient and modern history ; besides singing, music (violin and piano), and drawing, the cost for the whole being but six thalers (18s.) per annum. The number of scholars at this institution was 108 in the year 1862 63, of whom 60 were Seminar-aspiranten, or embryo schoolmasters; while the remaining 48 pupils were youths who were principally intended to act as clerks in some merchant's office, or as shopmen in some warehouse, and who consequently thought it advisable to protract their studies some what beyond the ordinary routine of the citizens' schools. At the first, and even the second Citizens'-school, the education is very nearly the same as at the Sekundar Schule, the difference consisting not so much in the subjects taught as in the advanced character of the studies in such subjects. In neither of these schools, however, are the pupils instructed in instrumental music; whilst in the second Citizens'-school Natural Philosophy and Chemistry are dispensed with. The main distinction, indeed, between the first and second Citizens'-schools is merely one of price ; at the former institution, the charge being 9s. yearly, and at the latter only from 3s. to 4s. Gd.: so that the scholars belong in the one case to the richer class of burghers, whereas in the other they are the sons of the poorer townspeople. Hence we can readily understand why there should be only 280 boys in the first school, and as many as 350 in the second one. The teachers at these schools are of course far greater in number thau those employed in the State schools, but they are, on the other hand, of a less distinguished character, being, for the most part, schoolmasters proper, who have received merely the education of ordinary Seminarists; whereas the preceptors at the gymnasium institutions are generally doctors-of-law, who have taken their de gree at the University, and who, in some cases, as a mark of their superior attainments, have been allowed to prefix the more honour able title of Professor to their names. Nevertheless, the English reader will be astonished to note how small a sum in Germany is thought not only a sufficient recom pense for so many years' study, but a sufficient income to maintain even a Professor as a gentleman. The director at the Gymnasium receives \u00a3180, and the Professors, upon an average, only \u00a375 a-year; whilst at the Real-Gymnasium the director gets \u00a3158, and the other professors mostly \u00a360 per annum. At the City schools, however, the teachers are paid, mostly, at the rate of \u00a337 10s. every year (which is about the wages of an English dustman); whilst at the first and second Citizens'-school the"], [181, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 165 director, who has to superintend both institutions, as well as the secondary school, has a salary of \u00a397 10s. annually, and the teachers are in the receipt of sums varying from \u00a300 down even to \u00a330 a-year. One would imagine that in a country where a tolerably sound education can be obtained for the small sum of 3s. to 4s. Gd. per annum, such things as \" free schools \" would hardly be required; but such is the poverty of the poor in Eisenach, that even three farthings a-week for the education of their children is found to be too large an outlay for the wretched working-people to bear ; so that as all are bound by law to send their boys and girls to school immediately they are six years old, the authorities, to enable the poorer classes to comply with the injunctions of the State in this respect, have been compelled to found a Free school, where the children of those who have not even a pfenning to spare beyond what is required for keeping body and soul together, may be edu cated gratuitously. At these free schools the course of instruction is the same as at the second Burghers' school, and there are alto gether some 200 scholars (boys and girls included) attending them. The total number of scholars attending the several schools of Eisenach is upwards of 2000 ; but many of these are students at the forest-schools, and youths at the Seminarist Institution, as well as apprentices studying at one or other of the working-men's school, and who are consequently above the ordained scholastic age \u2014 which is legally fixed at from six to fourteen years ; while the little children at the \" Kinder-gartens,\" on the other hand, are too young to come within it. If, then, we exclude all such from the calculation, as well as the boys and girls attending the drawing school, we shall find that the gross number of children in Eisenach, between the ages of six and fourteen, is, as nearly as possible, 1900, and then dividing this by the 200 poor boys and girls in the free schools, we arrive at the conclusion that between one ninth and one-tenth of the population are so poor that they cannot even afford to spare three farthings a-week for their children's education. At this free school there is but one paid teacher, (who gets only \u00a322 10s.) to the entire 200 scholars; for the elder of the seminarist-students have to give their services to it gratuitously \u2014 a plan by which a double good is effected ; the poor being thus educated at the cheapest possible rate, and the embryo schoolmasters grounded in the practical rudiments of their profession. There still remains one other gratuitous scholastic institution"], [182, "166 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to be mentioned \u2014 an institution open, without cost, to girls as well as boys, i. e. the free Drawing-school. This was founded, and is still maintained, by funds provided by the late Grand duchess. None are bound by law to attend this school, neverthe less many boys and girls are sent thither by their parents on the half-holidays, to take advantage of the benefits it so generously affords. The hours of attendance are from 10 to 12 in the fore noon for boys, and from 1 to 3 in the afternoon for girls, on every \"Wednesday and Friday \u2014 the number of pupils being 35 boys and 25 girls, or 60 altogether, between the ages of 9 and 15 years; and the Professor receiving a salary of 300 thalers (\u00a346) for his services, At this school the pupils are instructed in what is called \"free-hand drawing.\" There now remains but one other kind of boys' school to be mentioned, and that is the private one maintained by the Jews, f or the education of their children in their own religion as well as in the Hebrew language. This school, however, may be regarded more as a separate class for special instruction, appended to the City schools, than as a distinct academic establishment ; for the youths attending it go to the Burghers '-school as well \u2014 where they receive the greater part of their education \u2014 and are merely taught by the Jewish preceptor such matters in their over-time as none but one of their own persuasion could instruct them in. The boys at this school are all boarded and lodged in the house of the master ; for they are mostly the children of Israelites, who reside at some distance from the town, and who are anxious to secure for their sons the advantages of an education at the Eisenach seminaries, in con junction with private instruction in their own creed. The charge here is 100 thalers (\u00a3 I 5) the year, while the number of scholars is but nine ; so that one cannot help wondering not only what can possibly be the profit got out of so small a sum, but how any one can manage to live .upon the gains of merely nine big boys, whose keep alone one would imagine to cost more than the amount charged. The Jewish schoolmaster, however, has several per quisites wherewith to eke out his income. He is also, strange to say, the Jewish butcher for the Israelites domiciled in the city, and receives a matter of ten groschens for every ox he slaughters, besides so many pounds of the meat gratis, as well as a groschen for every pair of fowls he has to decapitate. Moreover, he is the officiating minister at every circumcision, and has to be present, as assistant to the Rabbi, at every Jewish wedding occurring in any"], [183, "167 THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. of the towns or villages round about ; so that, what with the mar riages and the births \u2014 the circumcisions \u2014 the cutting off the heads of cocks \u2014 and the slaughtering of bullocks, the poorly-paid Jewish preceptor is after all, a well-to-do man. Let us add, too, in all justice, that we never knew a worthier individual ; nor one with such a heart \u2014 with such a nose. The girls' schools will require but a brief notice at our hand. These are mostly City schools, of which there are three in number. First comes the one absurdly styled \" The Higher Daughters' School\" (die hohere Tochterschule), the said \"higher\" young ladies being, for the most part, the children of pretentious publicans or chandler's-shop keepers, who consider the girls at the ordinary City schools too common for their daughters to associate with. At this school there are seventy pupils and nine teachers, the salary of the director being \u00a367 10s. and those of the teachers (the majority of whom are men) \u00a341 5s. per annum; whilst the cost of the instruction is but \u00a32 5s. a-year. For this sum the pupils are taught German, French, and English ; Arithmetic and Writing ; History and Geography ; Religion and Biblical History, as well as singing, music, and needlework. Secondly, there are the girls' classes at the first and second burgher-schools, at which the education costs the same as for the boys, viz. 9s. per annum in the first school, and from 3s. to 4s. Gd. a year in the second one. The course of instruction here is very nearly the same as for the boys, with the exception that the les sons in Geometry, Natural Philosophy, Natural History, and Chemistry, are dispensed with, and such feminine work as sewing, knitting, and embroidery, substituted for the more masculine ac quirements. No instrumental music, however, is taught, but only singing ; for, as we have elsewhere said, it is quite as unusual to meet with a German lady who is able to play any instrument, as it is to know an educated gentleman who is not master of some two or three. The only other girls' school is the private establishment of Fraulein Moder. Here the instruction consists of the German, French, and English languages, and Literature ; Arithmetic, and Writing ; History and Geography ; Religion and Biblical His tory ; Drawing, Modelling, and Gymnastics ; besides nature knowledge (Naturkunde) and the principles of health (Gesund heitslehre); music and singing, however, being extra. At this establishment there are twenty and more young ladies, the half of whom are English, and mostly from Manchester. There arc"], [184, "168 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. no regular teachers, with the exception of Fraulein Moder herself, in connection with the institution ; but the best of the Professors from the principal schools are in the habit of attending there, to give so many hours' lessons in the course of the week. The cost of the schooling, with board and lodging, is \u00a330 a-year to German ladies, and \u00a340 a-year to English ones ; with \u00a31 10s. extra for those who stay at the school during the four weeks' holiday at Midsummer. Moreover, every young lady is expected to bring with her, on entering the establishment, the following stock of furniture, linen, and other articles ; a chest of drawers ; a bedstead, bedding and bed-linen, complete, with a quilted counterpane and \" Staubdecke\" (a holland coverlet to protect the bed from dust in the daytime) ; 12 hand-towels; 12 table-napkins; a case containing a knife, fork, and table-spoon ; 1 tumbler; 1 cup with tea-spoon; 1 um brella ; and 2 black aprons with bibs. The only remaining scholastic institutions \u2014 if indeed so pre tentious a title can seriously be applied to what are public nurse ries rather than seminaries \u2014 are the Einder-gartens, so common throughout Germany. Though the German title of these infant schools means literally children's gardens, there never is, so far as we know, any such pleasant place in connection with them ; and hardly even a playground such as is peculiar to English academies. For the only open space for the sports of the little things at the Eisenach infant school was a narrow fore-court leading to the \" Children's Protection Institution\" \u2014 as the Einder-garten be longing to the city is somewhat pompously styled. The \" insti tution\" itself, indeed, consists merely of a ground-floor containing one not- particularly- large room, a small sleeping-chamber where the younger children are put to sleep after their dinners, and a kitchen where the bread is made. In the larger room, which is about the size of a board-room at a workhouse, some 150 children, of from four to six years of age, have to pass the entire day, when the weather does not admit of their games, their exercises, or their singing being carried on in the open air ; for they are brought hither at seven in the morning, and not taken home till the same hour in the evening. The charge for the superintendence of the little ones is positively e-normous \u2014 in the literal sense of the word ; for assuredly it is contrary to all rule in England, that a child should be taken care of for 12 hours every day, and have its dinner supplied to it, as well as bread morning aud evening, at the cost of the twelfth of a farthing per week ! \u2014or rather more"], [185, "t'rfE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 169 than a penny per quarter. The dinner, however, consists of soup furnished by the public soup-kitchen, which is supported by \" charitable donations,\" and the bread is obtained in a like elee mosynary manner. At the City Institution there are two female teachers, who instruct the children in the first rudiments of reading, writing, and reckoning \u2014 the positive schooling being limited to one hour per diem, and the rest of the time devoted to either singing, or marching, or else in playing round-games, or knitting. Moreover, some of the children who are sent to the school without stockings are supplied with \" hose\" that have been knitted by the elder scholars ; and usually in the course of each day some one or other of the patronesses of the institution visits the place to see that the young ones are properly tended. The other Einder-garten, however, is a more expensive and genteel \"establishment,\" the charge here being as high as Gd. per week ; but for this sum the children are provided with toys also \u2014 the method of instruction and training being nearly the same. No dinner, however, is supplied here, the young ones being taken home for their meals, and the hours of attendance being only from 9 to twelve, and from 2 till 4. The \" Garten\" here consists of two small rooms on a first floor, where are gene rally to be found some 25 little boys and girls, either chanting infantine verses, or building houses out of tiny-wooden bricks ; or else arranging kaleidoscopic patterns out of bits of coloured paper, or making baskets out of perforated cardboard or of coffee berries, cloves and rice ; and, indeed, doing a hundred and one odd things to keep them at once in order and out of mischief. The children attending at this more expensive establishment are mostly the bovs and girls of such citizens as have either no servant, or else merely a maid-of-all-work, whose time is too much occupied to attend to the younger branches of the family ; while at the poorer institution they are principally the children of working-people \u2014 either artisans or day labourers \u2014 whose wives are often out at work all day, and even when at home too busy washing or scrubbing to be able to give heed to their own offspring. The hours of attendance at these different schools are, for the public schools, from 7 till 11, and 1 till 4. At the City Schools, however, the hours in the afternoon are only from 1 till 3 ; at Fraulein Moider's they are from 8 till 12 and 2 till 4, and at Fraulein Trabart's Kinder-Garten from 9 till 12 and 2 till 4. At the Forest School the attendance is from 7 till 9 and 1 0 till 1 2 in the morning, and 2 till 5 in the afternoon ; and at the Seminarist"], [186, "170 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Institution from 6 till 10, and 1 till 3. At the Jews' School, on tbe other hand, the boys are taught Hebrew from 7 J till 8 J every morning, and religion and music from 1 till 3 in the afternoon thrice a-week. At the Einder-Bewahr Anstalt (the Children's Protection Institution) the little things are kept all day, from 7 till 7. The Holidays consist of two half-holidays (Wednesday and Saturday afternoon) every week, and generally of four weeks at Midsummer, one week at Christmas, and the same at Easter, Whitsuntide, and Michaelmas. At the Forest School there are two vacations of a month each ; the one from April to May, the other from September to November. At the Kinder-Garten for the poor people, on the other hand, there are no holidays what ever. The Rewards consist sometimes of books presented to the more deserving pupils. At the State Schools, however, no prizes are given. Corporeal punishment, on the other hand, is inflicted only in cases of wanton absence from school, the usual penalties for bad conduct being either the imposition of some task or con finement in the \" Career,\" as it is called, for a certain number of hours or days, according to the offence. At the Seminarists' In stitution expulsion is occasionally resorted to. Examinations. \u2014 There are seldom any \" examens \" to be made on entering the schools, the rule being generally for the new scholar to come provided with a certificate from some preparatory establishment. On leaving, however, such examinations are often required. At the Forest School, for instance, it is essential that the Forst-practikant should \" pass \" a three-day examen in mathe matics and natural phdosiphy before he can become a forest helper. So, too, at the Seminarist Institution. A State exami nation must be made before the Seminar-aspirant can occupy the post of assistant-teacher. At the State Schools, again, it is necessary for the scholar to pass an examination iu certain cases ; for without having done this at the Gymnasium or Real-Gymna sium he would not be received at the University or the Forest School, or allowed to fill any Government situation. There are altogether 2347 scholars distributed throughout the schools of Eisenach, and 80 teachers and professors, which is at"], [187, "THE SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. 171 the rate of just upon one schoolmaster to every thirty boys. Now, the population of Eisenach is about 13,000 \u2014 so, dividing the one by the other, we find that the gross number of scholars to the people, is in the ratio of 1 to every 5'5, or 18 per cent, of the entire inhabitants \u2014 which is assuredly a very high rate of educa tion. Throughout the entire Grand-duchy of Saxe-Weimar the proportion of scholars to people is 1 to every 7 '5 of the population, or only about 13 per cent. ; whereas in England the rate given by Mr. Horace Mann in the Census of 1851 (we have no other returns at hand) is 1 day scholar to every 8-36 of our folk, which is not quite 12 per cent. While, therefore, only 12 per cent, of our people are at school, as many as 13 per cent, of the Saxe- Weimar folk are being educated, and not less than 18 per cent. of the inhabitants of Eisenach. But, despite all this education, we are satisfied that an English mechanic, who can just manage to read his Sunday newspaper, is a more handy, a more inventive, and a more worldly-wise man than the most learned German professor we ever encountered in the Thuringian capital. In Germany every child must be at school from six to fourteen years of age. This is part of the law of the country, and the father who neglects to comply with it, as soon as his son or daughter has entered his or her seventh year, is im mediately summoned before the Vorstand (the committee) of the city schools, and examined as to the reason of his child's absence. If the excuse be sickness or weakness on the part of the little one, permission, maybe, is given for it to remain at home for half a-year longer ; for the law is not very stringently enforced up to that age. Then, however, a doctor's certificate must be produced, and if that cannot be done, the parent who still neglects to comply with the injunction is imprisoned, at first for four days, and for the second offence from a fortnight to a month ; after which the dereliction is treated as a criminal offence, and the man tried and punished accordingly. If it be the desire of the parent to have his son or daughter educated at home, then a certificate must be produced from some teacher who has passed his examination, in order to show that the child is being privately educated by a duly qualified person. If, on the other hand, the father dissent from the established religion of the country, and is unwilling to have his children educated in doctrines which he believes to be either false or foolish, then the religious part of the education can be dispensed with. VYe made some inquiries as to whether parents were ever found"], [188, "172 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to violate such laws ; and we were credibly informed that there never was known a case of a father persistently refusing to have his child educated. In the free school, however, if often happens that the children are sent out to beg for two or three days to gether by their parents, and thus kept away from school for a certain time. Such offences are generally punished with the imprisonment of the father or mother (if she be a widow) of longer or shorter duration, as the case may be. Sometimes, too, boys stop away from school, of their own accord, for several days to gether, unknown to their parents. For such misconduct they are beaten by the school-servant with a stick, this being the only offence for which corporal punishment is inflicted ; and for the second offence they are locked up in the \" Career,\" or prison-cell, and kept there from two to four days, upon merely bread and water. The legal age for leaving school is stated at fourteen years ; if, however, the pupil be so little advanced in his studies, either from inordinate indolence or stupidity, then the masters of the school have power to force him to continue there until his sixteenth year. If, however, such be the law throughout Germany \u2014 that every child must be at school between the age of six and fourteen years \u2014 how comes it, the cunning reader will ask, that there can be a greater proportion of children in the course of education in one part of the country than in another \u2014 as, for instance, in Eisenach, where the ratio is as high as 18 per cent., whilst that for all Saxe- WTeimar is but a little more than 1 3 per cent. ? The explanation is, that either there are more children receiving private instruc tion at home, or else that the children themselves are more numerous iii comparison with the rest of the population \u2014 a num ber of strangers being sent thither to be educated. Hence we see that, though the educational returns for England and Wales show that there is barely 1 2 per cent, of the population at school in our country, we are, nevertheless, in no position to judge accu rately as to whether education is less general in England than in Saxe-Weimar \u2014 until we know whether the ratio of the young to the adult population is the same in both countries, aud whether private tuition is carried on to the same extent in both. From our own experience, we should say that governesses and tutors are in England far more general than in Germany ; for we heard only of one family having such additions to their household in Eisenach, whereas with us the daughters even of professional men are mostly thus educated."], [189, "CHAPTER XVIII. OF THE MODERN CURREND SCHOOLS IN EISENACH. One os the most pleasant associations (as well as one of the most interesting, on account of its forming so marked an epoch in the history of Martin Luther's early life) connected with tbe town of Eisenach, is the Currend School, which still exists there, and whose scholars to this day chant then- hymns in the streets every Sabbath morning; while the smaller Currend boys, in their long cloaks, and the big old-fashioned hats which make them look like httle old men, still rattle their tin padlocked money-boxes, and intone their cry of \" Coo-o-or-end ! \" in the halls of the different houses of the town, in the hope of obtaining a farthing or two in return for the chorals they have sung hi the streets before day- light. Indeed, if the ugly, dirty Thuringian capital could be stripped of its Lutheran associations \u2014 if little Martin had never begged his bread in its narrow tumble-down streets \u2014 if Dame Ursula had never taken the starveling boy to live with her in the very house that is still to be found in a bye-corner of the \" Wednesday's market-place,\" \u2014 or, if in after-life, when Luther had fought the battle of Protestantism almost to the point of death before the world's prelates and magnates at Worms, he had never been secreted as \"Junker Georg\" in the little room of the \"Ritters- haus \" at the Castle of the Wartburg (as if the Thuringian capital had been destined to be the place that should give shelter to the great Liberator of mankind twice at the most eventful periods of his life) ; if there were no such associations as these in connection with the dingy, old, and now-utterly-inhospitable city, the place would be as forsaken as a German bath in the winter-time ; for the avaricious townsfolk have lapsed into little better than a horde of plundering Arabs, who, though they may give salt and bread"], [190, "174 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to the stranger, think it by no means necessary to abstain from robbing him at the very first opportunity. By far the most delightful recollection we have in connection with the city, is that of being waked up before daylight on the day after our arrival there, and hearing these same Currend boys chanting outside our hotel, one of their Sabbath carols in the darkness. We had come expressly to the town to make ourselves acquainted with the several places upon which Martin Luther had conferred a glory. We had arrived too late in the evening, and too tired, to be able to find out overnight the \" Cotta-house \" as it is called to this day. Wre had only seen the Castle of the Wart burg in the dusk of the sunset, capping the steep conical mountain on one side of the city ; and we had gone to bed dreaming of the long-reverenced objects that were to be revealed to our eyes on the morrow. We had forgotten all we had read of the Currend scholars and their songs in the streets at early dawn, and we were aroused, before daylight, by a sound of a choral in the air that stirred us more deeply than any music we had ever listened to. Music at all times, when the mind is at rest, has somewhat of a celestial character connected with it, to those who will allow themselves to be absorbed by the measure \u2014 especially if the tune be of a plaintive or sacred character ; for the soul is entranced, as it were, by such strains, and transported far away beyond earthly things and worldly cares. Music on the water, when the air is still, and the shades of night begin to draw the curtains of heaven round about the earth, has always charms of the most exquisite kind to any thoughtful or emotional nature ; but music in the dead of the night, when the hubbub of trade and commerce and the strife of man's greed, have ceased for a while ; when the streets are quiet as a ruin ; when all are wrapped in slumber, and as still as death for the time being, and when every house is as silent and dark as a tomb ; when the stars are twinkling through the grey firmament, as though they were so mauy angel-eyes watching over us \u2014 music, and more particularly sacred music, heard while the mind is half asleep and half awake, has some thing almost supernatural and seraphic in its character; so that when this same Currend choral sounded for the first time in our ears, we had to rub our eyes before we could assure ourselves we were not listening to the chanting of some angelic choir as we lay dozing in our bed. And when we had made out to ourselves that the chanting must be that of the very \"Currend boys\" whom we had come so many miles to listen to ; and remembered too that"], [191, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 175 they were reminding us, as of old. that the Sabbath May bad arrived, we blessed the little fellows for turning our thoughts in so sweet and graceful a manner from earth and its daily troubles to Heaven and its eternal peace. There are at the present time some sixty of these currend boys connected with what is called the \" Second Burgers' School \" of Eisenach. Thirty of these are from fifteen to twenty years old, while the ages of the remainder vary between fourteen and ten, and even less. The currend scholars form part of the church choirs, and are educated in singing so as to be able to take part in the services at the two principal churches in the town. One half of the boys \u2014 fifteen of the younger and fifteen of the elder boys \u2014 sing hymns and chorals every other Sunday (though for merly it was customary for the youths to do so twice and even thrice in each week) between the hours of five and six in the moming \u2014 winter and summer, snow or wind ; heavy rain alone staying them \u2014 in front of the principal houses, and in some cases along the streets of the town. One moiety of the older and younger boys, with the currend director at their head, sing in one half of the town one Sunday, and the other half on the fol lowing Sabbath. These lads are chosen for the office, as well as for forming part of the choir of St. George's and St. Nicolai Churches \u2014 and are selected from the scholars of the different academic institutions in Eisenach on account of their melodious voices, and taught singing for two or three years before they are allowed to join the church choir. The houses outside which the currend boys chant, are said to be generally the same as they were in Martin Luther's time. They consist chiefly of the larger dwellings in which the wealthier burghers of old resided \u2014 and in which many a \"Rath\" or town councillor lives to the present day \u2014 as well as the majority of tbe bakers' shops distributed throughout the city. The boys come provided with the scores of the different parts of the hymn they are to sing in the streets on that morning ; and, as soon as it grows light, they make use of these as guides to the general harmony \u2014 the lads, as they halt in front of the appointed houses, and prepare for the next chant, grouping themselves about the director who first strikes the key-note with the tuning fork he holds in his hand, and who then proceeds to regulate the time and modulation of the choral. As soon as divine service is over, the younger portion of the"], [192, "176 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. singers assemble in the Wednesday's market-place under the \"Burgers'\" school with their \"currends,\" or little tin money boxes in then hand. These \"currends,\" from which the insti tution derives its distinctive name, consist of small circular boxes made of tin, about the size of a child's mug, with a slit at top, a padlock in front, and a handle at the back. They are painted brown, and are still of the same form as they were in the time of Martin Luther, whose currend-box may be seen preserved to this day in the Luther chamber at the Wartburg. When the whole of the little fellows deputed to collect the donations for the day have come together, they file off in couples, each pair of boys proceeding to solicit alms in the different streets of the quarter in which they have collectively chanted in the morn ing. It is customary for the citizens at whose houses the boys sing regularly to pay 10 groschens (or Is.) even' quarter of a year towards the support of the institution ; so that the youngsters beg only at the dwellings or shops of the non-subscribers throughout the locality which forms part of their beat. Upon reaching the houses, the little lads open the doors or enter the open shops, and then, with their money-box held forth in their hand, they cry aloud, as we have before described, with a peculiar drone, and with a prolonged emphasis on the first syllable of the word \" Coo-o-or-end ! \" while they jingle the coins in their little tin boxes to remind the people of the object of their visit. Their usual reward is more or less pfennings (twelve of which go to an English penny) according to the amount of liberality or small change belonging to the donor at the time. It should be added, however, that it is the common custom with the chandler's-shop keepers and beer-sellers of the town to keep all the suspicious small coins of other duchies, which they find a difficulty in getting others to receive, expressly to give to the curreud scholars; for they will be glad, the dealers know, to take money which every other person rejects with scorn. The sums thus collected are handed over to the safe custody of the director of the Burger-school, and divided, together with the subscriptions received, among the currend-boys every quarter of a year. The money serves to find them in clothes or such other articles as they may require ; the only drawback being that those boys who have failed to assemble at the appointed time and place, when it was their turn to take part in the Sunday morning chant, have to forfeit one groschen for each day they were absent out of the money coming to them at the quarter's end."], [193, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 177 \" The origin and foundation of these currend-schools,'' says Herr Johann Storch, in his \" History of Eisenach,\" \" is unknown.'' Dr. Croly, in his \" Life of Luther,\" explains the meaning of the title as follows : \u2014 \" The word currend,\" he says, \" is derived from the Latin currere, to run, and with the addition ofschuler (scholars) is applied to a company of boys attached, in Luther's early days, to almost all large German towns, who walked, or ran, through the streets, singing hymns.\" But this is the very dotage of classical learning, for on refe rence to Adelung's Worterbuch, we find the term thus defined : \u2014 \" 1. In some parts of the country the sending round certain church matters which have to pass between the custos and school masters of one village and another ; also the leaden case or box in which the same church property is kept. 2. In a collective sense, it means poor scholars who sing for alms in the streets, and also the entire institution for such poor scholars.\" To go into the currende, we are told, signifies to become one of such scholars, and therefore a currendaner, or currend scholar, is one who goes to such an institution. (Vol. i. p. 1062.) Hence it is manifest that the term currend was applied to such schools, not because the scholars \" walked or ran \" through the streets (as Dr. Croly absurdly supposes), but because the word was borrowed from the Latin currendurn, and originally signified something to be carried round or circulated \u2014 like the poor-box, by the sacristans among the parishioners ; whilst it afterwards came to stand for, instead of the poor-box itself, the alms that were gathered in such a manner ; and lastly for the schools which were mainly supported by donations collected in such currend boxes. Consequently, the Currend-schule was originally nothing more than a particular kind of charity-school, where the choir-boys were taught choral music and allowed to sing outside the burgh ers' houses on certain days ; after which they were sent round at certain periods of the week with such currend-boxes in their hands, to collect from house to house funds for their maintenance \u2014 as, we have shown, is the practice in Eisenach to the present day. These institutions, doubtlessly, were somewhat equivalent to our own charity-schools ; for it is known the currend-scholars of old were accustomed to sing in the church-service, the same as charity children with us. There was, however, this simple dif ference between the two institutions ; the currendaners themselves 19"], [194, "178 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. had to collect the alms by which they were supported, whereas, with our charity boys, the collection is made for them. More over, at many of our ancient monastic schools and colleges there is generally some institution in connection with them for main taining certain poor scholars \u2014 such as the \" Bishop's boys \" at Westminster, and the \" Sizars \" at Cambridge. Probably the institution of the currend-schools in Germany arose from the fact that a number of boys were required to sing in the services at the cathedrals of the larger towns, and that owing to the beauty of many of their voices, they were encouraged by the wealthier town's-folk to chant hymns outside their houses at certain times and seasons, by the distribution of a small dole to them ; and thus a practice which was perhaps voluntary and only occasional at the outset, came, in the days of the Mendicant Friars, when alms seeking was considered to be a part of religion, to shape itself into the half-begging and half-self-supporting insti tutions, that the German \" currend-schools \" remain to this day. lt has been suggested by others, that the practice of alms-gather ing, permitted, or rather enjoined, at such schools originated with the begging friars who wandered from shrine to shrine, living upon what they collected at the houses of the rich by the way ; or that it was connected with the ancient institution of the \" Bac chantes,\" whose custom it was to sing their dithvrambs for alms at people's doors. But it certainly appears less far-fetched to refer the origin of these same schools to the requirements of the Romish Church, and assume that they sprang out of the educa tion which was given by the Mendicant Friars in exchange for the services of the boy-singers at mass, and with which the prac tice of singing in the streets for dole came afterwards to be regu larly associated. After the Reformation, the currend-scholars became the Lutheran choir-singers, and were admitted to the Chapel Royal ; and though it would seem that the original custom was for them to sing twice, or even thrice, in the week in the streets, their chanting has now come to be limited merely to the Sunday mornings \u2014 though the periods of collection continue to be bi-weekly, as in the days of old. In the olden time it was usual for each of the currend-boys to be provided with a mantle similar in shape to the Catholic \" 67tor rock\" but of a thick material ; for we find in the historical account of Eisenach the choir singers were formerly, one and all, clad in a blue cloth cloak (sammtlich mit einem blauen Tuch-mantel bek-"], [195, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 179 leidct). These mantles, however, were discarded for many years, and it was not uutil the boys were supplied with cloaks, through the liberality of one of the principal manufacturers of the town of Eisenach, that the \" currend scholars,\" made their appearance in the streets in their ancient garb\u2014 -though the modern mantles are of a hideous undertaker-like cut and colour rather than the ordained blue tint. The hats, worn at the same time by the boys, are of the most ludicrously-antique character ; for it is the custom in the school for these articles of attire to descend almost from generation to generation, the new scholars purchasing them for a few pence"], [196, "180 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. from the old ones, as the elder boys leave to become schoolmasters and cantors (church-music directors) in some small village. The consequence is, one sees httle boys of eight or ten years of age wearing hats that are big enough for their grandfathers, and which, from the antiquated, funnel-like shape of the article, would appear to have been first worn by some village buck towards the end of the last century. Indeed, though the Eisenach hats, which, as we have before said, the citizens delight to appear in only on Sundays, and funerals, are of the most old-fashioned character, still, odd and droll as they appear in the present day, those of tbe currend boys immeasurably surpass them in the cari cature-like character, which such antiquated articles give to the very young. The annexed illustration is a faithful picture of one of the httle choir-boys as he appears in his old-fashioned man's hat and long black cloak, and with his little tin money-box stretched out as he cries his \" coo-o-or-end ! \" for alms at the door of the citizens. The picture is the more interesting from the fact that Martin Luther himself tells us that he was in the habit of doing the same in the streets of Eisenach, though, perhaps, in a more pic turesque costume than the ugly funeral garb of the present day. \" Let no one,\" he said, when he had become a great man, \" speak contemptuously, in my presence of the poor fellows who go sing ing through the streets and begging from door to door a little bread for the love of God \" ( Panem propter Deum, \u2014 such having been the cry of the Mendicant Friars as they stood, with then sack at their back, at the threshold of the houses in Luther's time). \" It is said,\" he adds, \" and it is true, that the Pope him self has been a poor mendicant singing-scholar, and you know the Psalm says ' princes and kings have sung.' I myself, too, was such a screaming beggar-boy. I was once one of those poor men dicant lads seeking my bread at people's houses, particularly at Eisenach \u2014 my own dear Eisenach ! \" For though the Great Reformer was left to starve, when a boy, despite bis piteous cry of \" bread for the love of God,\" for many a long week in the hard-hearted Thuringian capital, he never in after life could do other than speak of the wretched town than as his \"own beloved Eisenach,\" because he remembered how the good Dame Ursula Cotta had nursed and fed him as a child, when all others had turned their back upon his sufferings ; and how Frederick the Wise had sheltered him at the Wartburg when the malevolent Papists were seeking to burn him at the stake."], [197, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 181 No wonder, then, that to so warm-hearted and loving a creature as Martin ever was, the recollection of these two acts of kindness should have made Eisenach one of the greenest spots in memory's waste. In order to understand better the character of this ancient Currend Institution in Eisenach, we obtained permission from Herr Schmidt, the rector of the Second Burgers' School (to whom indeed we are indebted for the greater part of the information before given), to accompany the boys on their early morning rounds through the city ; and he was' polite enough to give in structions that one of the Currend scholars should come and call us at our hotel immediately the singers were assembled in the market-place ; for as the boys meet as early as five, some such precaution was necessary with a person fresh from the British metropolis. The morning on which the lad came to us was a bleak and dark autumnal one, and as we emerged from the bright breakfast room of the hotel, kept ready for the travellers by the early trains, the street outside looked black as a cavern. Every one of the oil-lamps dangling in the middle of the streets had long since died out, not a star shone overhead, and the inky clouds hung so low that the firmament looked like a dome of lead. As we entered the open square of the Wednesday's market-place, the old tower of the Bath-haus, and the modern cupola on the palace roof, stood out in grim colourless dusk against the sombre sky. Not a soul was abroad, and only here and there a window shone, like a patch of gold, amid the black fronts of the houses, with the light of the early risers within. These were mostly at the bakers' shops ; or else, where the light was more like a phosphorescence behind the panes, we could tell it proceeded from the almost exhausted night lamp of some young mother's, or sick person's, chamber. We walked on for some short distance in the drizzling rain (for the clouds were just beginning to sprinkle the streets with a slight shower of early November sleet) without meeting a soul, till we came to the sentries, wrapped in their great coats, pacing in front of the palace, as they stamped their feet on the stones ; and, with the brass on their leathern helmets, glittering dimly in the light of the expiring oil-lamps in front of the palace-gates. Here, the Currend boy who acted as our guide inquired whether the choir had sung in the market-place. \" J a wohl,\" was the answer ; and accordingly we proceeded down the Carls Strasse. Here the way was darker than ever, and so still that we met no"], [198, "182 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. one but a stray railway-guard, in his fur cap and long gaberdine like coat, looking like some Jew in the olden time ; or else an early traveller hurrying along with his throat swathed in comfort ers and with his carpet-bag in his hand. Not a sound was to be heard but the dripping of the eaves, or the splashing of the water thread from the huge dragon-shaped gurgoils projecting from the roofs far into the roadway. As we neared the open Nicolai Platz, at the other end of the thoroughfare, our son, who accompanied us, said suddenly, \"Hark! I hear them now;\" and then as we stood still for a minute, we could catch something like the drone of an organ in the distance. Then hastening on again, the sounds grew gradually louder and louder, till as we turned the comer of the Saturday's market-place the choral burst upon us with exquisite distinctness and solemnity, in the utter stillness and darkness of all around us. Here some two or three casements were illuminated with the lights of the neighbouring hotel, while the shops of the early chandler's-store-keepers, were already opening for the sale of schnapps to the few passers-by. The long square tower of the Nicolai gate, and the tall octagonal turret, with its sharp spire, of the church hard by, had a half spectral look as they stood out against the grey eastern sky, The black group of Currend boys could hardly be made out across the open Platz, but their voices woke up the place with the choicest and gravest beauty, echoing and re-echoing against the many queer angles of the houses, and reverberating in the archways and ample fore-courts, till the sound of the hymn had hardly a human character about it ; for, as we trod the desolate square, the chant came rolling along towards us in fine rich waves of sacred harmony, so that it wanted but httle imagination to believe that the unseen singers, in the darkness, were some angelic choir hovering overhead. On approaching the youths, we could only distinguish that some were grown young men, and others mere children (it was still too dark to make out their features), and that almost all had thick comforters rolled about their neck, while many had grey plaid shawls wrapped tightly round their shoulders \u2014 for at that time the black cloaks which the lads now wear had not been dis tributed to them. When the chant in the Nicolai Platz was finished, we accompanied the Currend boys to the little \" fore town,\" as it is called, outside the gate. Here they startled the stillness of the early morn with another such hymn, which was sung in front of a httle baker's shop there, while the baker him-"], [199, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 183 self, in his long white apron, came and stood at the door, and taking the white cap from his head, listened uncovered while the sabbath choral resounded through the air Hence the group of choir-singers hurried off to the neighbouring Dyers' Quarter, and there they sang beside the bridge that spans the little stream, which in the daytime is blue as blue ink, with the tints of the cloth and yam continually being washed in it. Next we followed them to the Goldsmiths' Street, where another Sunday morning carol was given outside the houses, which, in the hght of the coming day, we could now tell, by the large orna mented gateways to them, were such as had been inhabited by the foremost citizens in the olden time. As the boys walked along this street too, they kept singing by the way, pausing now to chant a verse at the door of this dwelling, and another at that. Thus we came back to the Wednesday's market-place once more ; and here another and another matin-hymn was chanted, first in front of the town-hall (Bath-haus), then over against the palace, and lastly outside the \" Half-moon Hotel,\" where we were staying. Thence the little band of shivering boy-singers hastened back, across the market-place, to a bye-corner of the open square, behind the St. George's Church, which is now known by the name of the Luther's Platz ; and here in front of a large house, with a gateway carved with caryatides on either side of the arch, and a lofty pyra midal roof, they sang Martin Luther's own noble hymn ; \u2014 \" Our God's a mighty citadel, A trusty shield and weapon. He'll guard us safe from every ill That to mortal man can happen.\" Now this house, with the caryatides beside the gateway, we happened to know was the \" Cotta-house\" as it is called, and the very same dwelling in front of which Martin Luther himself \u2014 when he was but the same age as some of the younger of those Currend boys standing at our elbow \u2014 had sung his Sunday matin song to Dame Ursula. It was under that same quaint pyramidal roof, indeed, that the good merchant's wife, when she had been stricken with the sweetness of the little fellow's voice, and touched by the story of his sufferings in Eisenach, had given him shelter in the little room which we had seen but a day before overlooking the Butchers' street at the corner. So when we heard these young Currend boys malting the Platz ring with the very hymn"], [200, "184 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. that Martin Luther himself had lived to write in after-years, when he had become the great Reformer of his country, we never felt words or music touch our soul so deeply. The years seemed to roll back, and the history of one of the most pregnant accidents in connection with the life of a youth who was a mere beggar-boy at the time, appeared to be so vividly re-enacted to us, that we could almost fancy one of the youngsters at our side was little Martin himself warbling in the darkness ; and that we could see in the dusk, the good dame smiling in charity from above as she was carried away, like ourselves, by the sacred beauty of the song, as well as touched by the sad lot of those poor little fellows who were singing there in the darkness and the stinging chilliness of the early winter's morning. With the tears in our eyes we drew our young son to us, and bade him remember that morning and that place as long as he lived ; and to let it ever be an abiding token to him, that high faith and high courage can master every difficulty and every danger in the world. From the Luther's Platz the group of boy-singers turned off to the Smelters' lane, and thus they reached the long straggling thoroughfare that leads to the ancient \"Women's gate \" (Frauen ThorJ formerly standing at the end of this quarter. Here they chanted again, in front of several old mansions, with huge portals and many windows; while some of these houses had quaint Latin inscriptions over their doorway, such as \" Sit Pax intrantibus, SALUS EX EUNDIBUS.\" It was now growing light, and one could see the old Wasch fraus, as they were fetching water from the street-fountains in the long conical wooden pails strapped to their back, pause to rest their heavy load upon one of the stones placed for the pur pose at the side of the streets, and wait with their head bent in reverence while the singing boys drew themselves up in a semi circle around the director, and carolled forth another matin hymn, from the scores they were now able to read, as they held them in their hand. Here, too, the chant was repeated, in front of many a baker's shop as before ; whilst at other houses, where the chil dren had been newly taken from their bed, and placed half-dressed at the window to listen to the pretty Sunday-morning song, the little things with their long flaxen hair hanging all about their eyes, as if they were so many Skye-terriers, would clap their hands and crow as they listened to the voices in the twilight. Those, too, who were up and about in the streets took off their caps to the singers as they went by."], [201, "THE CURREND SCHOOLS. 185 By this time it was light enough to make out the character of the choir-boys, whom we had before known only as a vague in distinct group. They had all somewhat of a well-to-do air about them, aud certainly in no way approximated to the character of the poor beggar-boys who were wont to cry at the house-doors, \" Bread ! for the love of God,\" in the early days of Martin Luther. Some of them, it is true, reminded one strongly of the itinerant German-boy band-players seen in the streets of London ; and being clad in thin tweed coats, that were buttoned tight up to the collar, had a wretched, pinched, frost-bitten air with them. Some were fresh-coloured, with dark eyes and locks, while many were by no means bad-looking, or coarse-featured lads. Not a few, however, had the true string-like German hair, cut \" club fashion,\" and tucked behind their big red ears, together with the same washed-out complexion and white eyebrows and eyelashes which are distinctive of the Teutonic race. All had good strong shoes to their feet, and not one, even of the younger boys, looked in any way poverty-stricken. At some distance up the street last-mentioned, the matin chanting came to an end, and the boys parted to go home to breakfast. As they proceeded in different knots towards their houses, we walked in their wake, watching the kind of dwellings into which they disappeared, one after another, now that their morning's work was over. Their homes were mostly at the small chandlers '-shops, while some shot into the large portals belonging to the old burgers' houses, where every floor is now let out to the better class of citizens ; so that, as far as we could judge by such signs, the Currend boys of the present day have but little of the character of the mendicant choir- singers of old. A short while after accompanying the Currend singers on their rounds, we visited the house of the mother of one of the poorer and younger lads, who had been recommended to us by the Rector of the school. The family lived in a small cot outside the old George's gate, which formerly constituted one of the principal entrances to the town. The bricks in the passage from the door were all loose, and the light was shining through the cracks in the dark rickety staircase we had to mount. On the first floor we were ushered into a small neat chamber, the boards of which had been newly sanded. The furniture was exceedingly scanty; there was a small table, like that to a servant's bedroom, whilst in one corner stood a rude German stove, like a series of cast-iron mignonette-boxes arranged upon black flower-pots, and in the"], [202, "186 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. opposite angle of the room was ranged a row of large china pipes belonging to the woman's eldest son. There were a few painted religious prints, and a black profile portrait of the woman's late husband, decorating the walls ; while along the window-sills were set pots of china-asters and such common flowers as the autumn afforded. One or two bird-cages, made out of white wood and hardly bigger than cigar-boxes, hung from the ceiling, and in these robins and yellowhammers hopped and skipped with a rest lessness that gave one a terrible sense of their imprisonment. The woman herself was a spare, under-fed creature, in a rusty suit of black ; and we found her knitting 'as we entered. Her husband, she told us, had been dead ten years ; he had been a corporal in the army, and had died of fever. She had had two sons and one daughter, but the latter had died young. Her eldest boy was twenty years of age ; he was a day-labourer, and gave her something whenever he had work. She lived principally by carrying things up to the tavern on the summit of the Wartburg mountain, and received one penny farthing for every journey, besides getting something to eat when she reached the top of the steep hill. In summer, she often made the ascent three and four times in a day. She was usually employed in carrying provisions up there on her back, and sometimes she took as many as forty pounds at once. The hill was a very steep one, and \" such a load,\" she said, \"tried her dreadfully.\" In the fine weather, when many strangers come to see the Castle, she sometimes made the journey thrice, and oftener, in the course of the day. She called it a very good day's work, if she got five groschens (six pence, English) for her labour ; and out of this she had to keep herself and boy, who was at the Currend school. She had to pay eight thalers, or twenty-four shillings, a-year rent for the room she occupied, and did not make a thaler (three shillings) a-week regularly; indeed, she said her earnings were \"a long way off that;'' and if it were not that she had her food given to her up at the Wartburg, she did not know how she could live at all. When she took a large order from the Castle-tavern to the shops, they gave her a little coffee, or sugar, or a bit of black bread ; and so she made it out. The Currend school was a great help to her, especially as her boy had to pay nothing for his education, as he was the son of an old soldier. Other lads, however, had to pay one and a-balf thalers (four and sixpence) the year, to go into the \"Second Citizens' School;\" but there were schools where the poorest children paid nothing. The money which came to her"], [203, "187 THE CURREND SCHOOLS. boy out of the Currend box, helped her to buy shoes and clothes for him. If lads have a good voice they are taken into the choir ; and she considered it a great blessing that her little son had been thought fit for it. When she had a bit of meat given to her, they had \"flesh\" for dinner, but she never could afford to buy any. The day before our visit, she had carried up from thirty to forty pounds of beef and veal, to the Wartburg, and the butcher had given her a bit of liver sausage, for bringing him the order ; and that with a few potatoes had been their dinner that day. The boy was a good-looking little fellow, with a frank and somewhat intelligent expression. He was not more than ten or eleven years of age ; and when we used to tell him that the great Martin Luther had once been such a poor boy as he, he would look up in our face, his bright blue eyes twinkling the while, and say that he would strive to be one day as great a man as Martin himself."], [204, "CHAPTER XIX. OF THE OLD CURREND SCHOOL IN EISENACH AT THE TIME OF MARTIN LUTHER. WrE have before said that the Currend institution, at present, forms part of the \" Second Citizens' School\" (Zweite Burger schulej of Eisenach. At the time, however, when Martin Luther came to be educated in the town, it was connected with the then existing St. George's School. At that period, according to the Chronicles, there were three seminaries in the City. (I.) The Nicolai School, attached to the church and cloister of that name, and to which the Landgraf Herrmann had, at the end of the twelfth century, given the exclusive right of teaching the young folk of the district. (2.) The Marien School, appertaining to the cloister and church of the Blessed Virgin. Both of which have long since disappeared from the, city. (3.) The St. George's School, in association with the principal church of the capital, and conducted by the Franciscan Friars whose cloister imme diately adjoined it. The St. George's School at this date was carried on in the Franciscan chapel, which then stood at the end of the Landgraf's residence, or in other words at the western end of the large \"toll house,\" which, up to the time of Landgraf Balthasar (a.d. 1406) \u2014 who was the last of the Landgraves residing at the Wartburg \u2014 had served the Thuringian lords-paramount for a palace when ever they passed a night in the city. Paulinus, a local historian of the time, tells us that this Franciscan chapel was built in the 13th century, and that the monastery adjoining it stretched along the town walls from the spot known as the \"Parsonage Hill \" ( Pfarr-berg ) to the height that was afterwards christened the Charlotten-berg \u2014 after Charlotte, the wife of Wilhelm IV., who (a.d. 1701) beautified the pleasure-garden into which the old"], [205, "189 THE OLD CURREND SCHOOL. Franciscan cemetery, that once occupied the spot, had some few years before been converted. The tradition among the people of Eisenach is, that Martin Luther's school-house was situate where the palace brewery now stands ; and we ourselves, when but strangers in the town, were conducted to one of the malting floors in that establishment, and assured that this was the precise spot where Martin had been taught Latin by the learned rector John Trebonius \u2014 that same worthy schoolmaster who never entered the schoolroom without raising his cap to salute his pupils, and who, when upbraided for such an act of condescension to children, made the following memorable answer in the presence of little Martin Luther him self \u2014 an answer which he seems never to have forgotten, and the prophetic character of which probably sank deep into his soul: \u2014 \"There are among these boys men of whom God will make bur gomasters, chancellors, doctors, and magistrates : and, although we do not see them with the badges of their dignity yet about their neck, it is right we should treat them with the same respect.\" Notwithstanding the Eisenach tradition as to the site of the old Currend School in Martin Luther's time, prolonged examination soon convinced us that the prevailing belief as to its having been situate on the spot now occupied by the palace brewery, was utterly unfounded ; and a cursory search of the town chronicles soon taught us that, though Martin was in Eisenach at the close of the 1 5th century, this same building was not erected until the end of the \" 10th year hundred.\" For when the Landgrafenhof, as the Duke's residence-house was called, was enlarged by Duke Johann Ernst the Elder, the Currend School which had formerly been held in the chapel of the Barefeet, or Franciscan Friars, was for the first time removed, and established on the spot which the palace brewery now occupies.* Nor can there be any doubt as to the exact locality of the old Franciscan church as well as the school appertaining to it ; for the same authority who helped us to detect the fallacy of the city tradition, describes, moreover, the precise situation of the old seminary itself. \"The school,\" says the Chronicle, \" had its situation next to * The words of the Eisenach historian are :\u2014 \" Im 16'\"\u00b0 Jahr-hundert wurde der Landgrafen-hof erweitert und die Schule wurde mit dazu gezogen,^ woravf sie ihren Platz da, wo jetzt das Schloss-lrauhaus steht, erhalten hat.\" \u2014(Storch's Hist. Eisenach, p. 44.)"], [206, "190 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the Herren or Landgrafen-hofe, where the palace-tower of the ' Residence-house ' exists to the present day.\" Unfortunately, the old Franciscan school was demolished in the year 1597, when Duke Johann Ernst extended the Landgra fen-hof, and built himself a new wing, at the western end of the old ducal residence-house, out of the stones of the ancient church and cloister : while he converted the old Franciscan burial ground at the same time into the first pleasure-garden in connec tion with the palace. The St. George's School was then, and not until then, removed to the adjoining site, which is now occu pied by the brewery. After the Reformation, however, the scholars at the St. George's School increased so rapidly that it was found necessary once more to shift the locality of the seminary. Accordingly, at the begin ning of the last century, the academy was changed into a \" gym nasium,\" and removed from the site of the palace brew-house to that of tbe old Dominican or preacher's cloister, in the open square now known as the \" preacher's -place,\" and where the school exists to this day. On the removal of the St. George's School to its present quarters, the currend or choral part of the institution was trans ferred also, and it continued to be connected with that establish- ment until the year 1 836, when the superintendence of the choir was handed over to the directors of the \"Burger's School,\" under whose charge it continues to the present time. It may be as well, while dealing with these historical matters, to present the reader with a view of the old town of Eisenach as it stood only a few years after the date at which Martin Luther begged for bread in its streets. The copper-plate from which this is taken is a very ancient one, aud was but a few years ago broken up as old metal. The engraving is copied from a picture which still forms part of the property of the Corporation, and hangs usually in one of the chambers of the Rath-haus. The curious old original was kindly lent us, and sent to our lodgings for the purpose of completing our studies in connection with the town, by Herr Roese, the burgomaster of the city. It should be added, moreover, that though the town-walls no longer gird the Stadt, the following illustration will enable the reader to form a good notion of the city as it at present exists \u2014 so little has it altered since the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The title of the above picture, in English, is \" Eisenach as it formerly (von alters) stood,\" and the word formerly obviously"], [207, "the old currend school. 191 implies that the painting, even at the time when it was executed, was a copy of some already ancient one. In the original, from which the old engraving here given was made, there are Cupids in the air, holding the scroll upon which the above title is painted, and escutcheons in either corner emblazoned with the arms of the city and the then-existing landgraves ; while, stretching along the foreground of the picture, is a cavalcade of knights and town- councillors, attended by halberdmen, on their way to meet three skeletons on horseback. Above the head of each of the latter is a scroll indicating that the triad of mounted corpses is intended respectively to represent the defunct landgraves Balthasar, Herr mann, and Ludwig, accompanied with a quaint inscription in old German, saying : \u2014 \" As ye are, so were we : As we are, ye shall bo.\" At the bottom of the painting, moreover, is a series of chrono logical verses, extending as far back as the year 1000. It cost us some little trouble to make out the date of this pic ture ; for the people of the town assured us that it was known to have been executed long before Luther's time. This, however,"], [208, "192 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. was easily disproved by the fact that it was painted upon panel ; and a friend of ours, who was a dealer in ancient works of art, assured us that panel pictures were not known until the end of the sixteenth century. However, after long searching, we dis covered in one comer the sign-manual of the artist himself, with an inscription to the following effect : \u2014 \"This City of Eisenach have I, Johann Eohler, in the 53rd year of my age, painted. Finished, the lGth March, a.d. 1663.\" This old picture is highly prized by the town authorities of Eisenach ; for though but an indifferent work of art, it is a valu able memento of the ancient aspect of the city. It is upwards of twelve feet long and four feet high, and represents the town girt with its old walls and the many gates which were erected in the eleventh century, and which made it, at the time, a place of spe cial security, Every neighbouring hill-top, too, is capped by some ancient castle., all of which, with the exception of the Wartburg. have long since disappeared from the mountain summits, even as the city-gates and town-walls have tumbled into the city-ditch ; so that now only the old Roman structure of the Nicolai gate, with its tall conical tower (as shown in the engraving), remains at the lower end of the town, to mark the ancient character of the place. A few words now as to the \" Cotta House,\" and the fine old merchant family of the Cottas themselves, and the present chap ter is ended. The house as it now stands, in a bye-corner at the back of the principal market-place, is very much in the same condition as it was in the days when Luther sang his currend songs outside of it. We subjoin an engraving copied from a photograph of the old building, which will give the reader a far better notion of the structure than any verbal description can convey to his mind. In this domicile at the end of the 15th century, dwelt three merchant brothers of the names of Friedrich, Conrad, and Johann Cotta, who were amongst the wealthiest and most learned, as well as the most esteemed, of the Eisenach burgesses at the time. Johann, or Hans Cotta, the youngest of the three brothers, had filled the office of city Consul, or mayor, at three distinct periods, and had, moreover, been twice elected to serve as one of the city Scabeni or sheriffs. Indeed, so highly does the Cotta family ap pear to have been respected by the citizens of Eisenach, that,"], [209, "THE OLD CURREND SCHOO: 193 from the middle of the 15th down to that of the 16th century, the names of some one or other of the brothers, or their chil dren, occur almost every other year as having been chosen to fill the posts of chief dignity in the town The old registries of Eisenach were kindly lent us by Herr Roese, the burgomaster, for reference, in connection with this part of our subject, and from such records the above information has been derived. The name of Conrad Cotta alone is absent from the historical lists of the Consuls and Scabeni of the 15th century ; still, he is known to have been a member of the \"Rath* Collegium,\" a body which was equivalent to the corporation of town councillors in old English municipalities, and looked upon with such honour that the twenty-four members of it were styled the \" nobiles ministeriales \" \u2014 the noble city ministers. In the time of Landgraf Balthasar, indeed, it was thought so enviable a 13"], [210, "194 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. dignity to belong to this Baths Collegium of Eisenach, that many of the burghers promised their brother citizens, if they were elected to the office to contribute \" 300 schock groschen,\" or 90/., yearly towards the payment of the town debts. \u2014 See \" Starch's History of Eisenach.\" The gravestone of Conrad Cotta is still to be seen standing against the southern wall in the Eisenach cemetery, close to that of his brother Johann \u2014 the full-length figure of the latter, in his long fur-lined gown of office, being sculptured upon the tablet. The epitaph of Conrad tells us that he died in the 77th year of his age, but the precise date of his death has been unfortunately effaced by the mouldering of the corner of the stone. The central inscription on the gravestone is quaint enough, and to the following effect: \u2014 \" I KNOW THAT MT BEDEEMEB LIVETH, AND THAT HE WILL HEBEAFTEK WAKE ME OT/T OF THE EABTH ; AND THAT HE WILL THEREUPON ENCOMPASS ME WITH THIS MT SKIN, SO THAT I SHALL SEE GOD IN THE FLESH, AND I SHALL SEE HIM IN THE SPIRIT TOO, AND MT ETES SHALL BEHOLD HIM AS NO STBANGEB.\" Above and on either side of the central inscription the follow ing lines are engraven : \u2014 CONRAD COTTA IN GOD THE LORD SLEEPS IN THE 77TH TEAR OF HIS AGE JORGENS PLAN. The words that originally stood at the end of the second and beginning of the third line are now utterly lost. Immediately above the writing at the top of the gravestone are two escutcheons, one on either side ; that ou the left-hand contains the arms of the Cotta family, while the shield of the Luther family (three roses and half a crossbow) is to be seen on the right. In the centre, sculptured in relief, is the head of a cherub, bearing a curiously strong resemblance to Martin Luther himself, the neck above the wings being, oddly enough, swathed in a clerical cravat, such as Martin is represented as wearing in the portrait of him by Lucas Cranach. The year of the death of Conrad Cotta it is important to de termine, on account of the statements to be found in the works"], [211, "195 THE OLD CURREND SCHOOL. of the different Lutheran biographers concerning the position of Dame Ursula herself, when she took pity on the little Currend boy, and received him into her household. The tradition in Eisenach is that Ursula was a widow at the time ; and, indeed, this is taught in all the German Protestant schools. In \" Storch's History of Eisenach,\" the following statement occurs at p. 47 of that work : \u2014 \" The Reformer, Dr. Martin Luther, came to our Currend School at the end of the fifteenth century, and was a poor scho lar here, as is well known ; and a pious widow, named Cotta, had a mantle made for him on account of his agreeable voice.\" This story of the widowhood of Ursula Cotta at the time of her be friendment of Martin Luther is iterated by every recent writer on the subject. Audin speaks of Ursula as \" veuve d'un riehe bourgeois.\" (Hist, de la Vie, dc, de Martin Luther, p. 6.) Michelet, on the other hand, changes Conrad Cotta into a gentle man of the name of Hans Schweikard, of whom, he tells us, Ursula was the widow (\" Life of Luther,\" p. 5), though by what peculiar marital arrangement Frau Cotta could have been trans formed into the Wittwe Schweikard it is difficult to understand. Under these circumstances, a letter was sent to a descendant of the Cotta family at present living at Tarant, near Leipzig ; and he politely forwarded to us a copy of the genealogical tree of the family, with the dates of the birth and death of each member affixed ; and thus we learnt that good master Conrad was born in the year 1434, and died in the year 1511 ; so that, as Martin came to the Currend School of Eisenach in 1498, the merchant Conrad must have been some sixty-four years of age at the time, and have lived for thirteen years after \u2014 almost up to the period when his young protege was created Doctor of Theology in Wit tenberg. Nor, on the other hand, are the accounts given by the oldest ot the local writers on the subject, an iota more trustworthy ; for Christianus Paulinus, who was one of the first to prepare an \" Historical Dissertation upon the Ancient and Noble Family of the Cottas,'' has the following passage concerning Conrad and Ursula his wife : \u2014 \" Illi fasces detidit patri\u00e6 ut officii memor con suleret, et cuique suum daret. Iste sapiens dictus ad idem consu lates fastigium surrexit, anno mdxxv., uti Fridericus. Conradus ex Ursula Schalbia suscepit Bonaventurum II., consulem et mer catorem urbis primarium, ac Henricum II., etiam consulem, sed in c\u0153libatu extinclum.\""], [212, "196 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Upon searching the old town registers, however, we found that no member of the Cotta family was either mayor or sheriff of the city in the year 1525 ; but that in 1524 Johann filled that office instead of Conrad his brother ; so that it is beyond doubt that the two local traditions that Conrad had filled the office of burgo master of Eisenach, and that he was dead, and Ursula a widow, at the time of Martin Luther's residence in the Cotta house, are thus proved to be utterly unfounded. Concerning the age of the goodwife Ursula herself, no records exist. Of her family it is known, from the \" Historical Disser tation\" of Paulinus, that they bore the name of Schalbe, and in Lingk's \"Travels connected with the History of Luther,\" we are told she was the daughter of the mayor of Ilefeld. In the old town registries of Eisenach, however, we found the name of Hans or Johann Schalbe recorded as having been several times consul of the city between the years 1454 and 1475, while that of Hein rich Schalbe appears associated with the same office in 1495 and 1503 ; so that as citizens in former times seldom travelled far from their own homes in quest of wives, and the people of Eisenach to this day have continued to intermarry so uniformly with their own townsfolk that almost every person whom a true Eisenacher meets in his walks through the streets is either a first, second, or third cousin, and the cries of \" Guten Tag, Vetter \" (Good-day, cousin) resound at every moment on everv side \u2014 it would appear far more likely that Conrad Cotta should have been wedded to the daughter of this same Johann Schalbe who had filled the office of consul in Eisenach, than have gone all the way to Ilefeld to seek a burgomaster's daughter of the same name. The only portrait of the good lady Ursula existing uutil within the last century, we are assured by the principal living descendant of the family, was destroyed in the great fire at Ilmenau in the year 1752, so that now no trace of the linea ments of the pious \" Shunamite\" remains in the world. Of the Cotta children dwelling in the house on the \"Jorgen's Plan,\" (as Conrad's grave-stone tells us, the site which is now known as the \" Luther Platz \" was called in former times,) the genealogical tree, as well as Paulinus' historical account of the family, affirms that there were two young boys living at the time when Martin was made a foster-child in that illustrious house hold. These were Heinrich and Bonaventura, both of whose names appear in the old town records, as having been raised to the"], [213, "THE OLD CURREND SCHOOL. 197 highest dignities of the city ; while affixed to that of Heinrich there is an entry iu Latin at the time of his death, in the 3'ear 1565, saying that \"he was a well-to-do man, a great patron of learning, and that he studied at Wittenberg, where he was for five years the table companion of Martin Luther.\" So that thus we have historical evidence of the truth of the touching story told in most of the Lutheran biographies, that Martin Luther, when he had become the renowned Doctor of Theology in the Uni versity of WTittenberg, no sooner heard that the son of his old friends the Cottas had come to study at the College than he sent for the former playmate of his childhood, and out of gratitude for the family's goodness to him during his school-days in Eisenach, made him share his board and his lodging with him. It is impossible to inspect the Cotta-house as it exists intact at the present day, and to see the little room at one corner of the landing on the first floor, which, according to the tradition, served Martin for a bed-chamber, without considerable emotion. This room itself is hardly bigger than a pantry or larder ; and though bearing no traces of tho time when Martin occupied it (for the walls had been newly plastered and whitewashed when we saw it), it serves, nevertheless, to realize the kindness of the Cottas to the poor half-starving little fellow, and to suggest to the mind the many happy days Martin must have passed in those queer old-fashioned halls. A single glance at the spot is sufficient to set us fancying how often young Luther must have played with little Heinrich Cotta \u2014 the boy who was destined to come and hear him lecture as doctor of theology, in after-years \u2014 at the game of \" strike-ball \" out in the court-yard below. How many a time he and youug Cotta must have gone prancing through that wilderness of chambers in their mimic sport of coachmen (Fuhr leute). How frequently must he who was to be the great German Reformer have sat by the hour making whistles or pop-guns for his little playmate out of the branches of soft green wood, which they had gathered in their walks beside the Horsel stream ; and how, too, when he had managed to manufacture a cross-bow for little Heinrich, and they had set up some rudely-fashioned wooden bird in the Hof, the couple of little great men played together there at the popular Vogel-schiessen-spiel, (bird-shooting game) for the petty prizes of sugar-sticks or marbles \u2014 after the custom of German boys down to the present time, and even as Martin Luther himself, when he had grown a grave old man, delighted still to play with his own children."], [214, "198 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Nor can we help thinking, moreover, of the miraculous stories the pious Ursula must have recounted in those very rooms, looking out into the market-place, to the religious-minded youth, as to the wondrous charities and miracles wrought by the Holy Elizabeth, about whose virtues the whole Thuringian country was ringing at the time ; for the young saint of a princess had lived not very many years before, and had passed the greater part of her life at the castle on the mountain that overlooks the town. Indeed, it needs but the weakest imagination, when stimulated by the sight of this memorable old place, to fancy how Ursula, as she sat work ing some bit of tapestry, may be, with little Martin seated on the stool at her feet, in the large antiquated hall on the principal floor, must have delighted to have told the little fellow tales about the \"stolen Princes of Thuringia,\" or of \"Frederick with the Bitten Cheek;\" for such matters were in those days events, comparatively speaking, of yesterday, and were sure to have been deeply impressed upon her tender, motherly mind. It was while under this same Cotta roof, too, that the love of music, which formed so salient a point in Luther's after-character received its first training ; for although from childhood he had been gifted with a sweet and touching voice, and it was to this pretty faculty that he mainly owed his introduction to the Cotta family, Martin was, up to the time of his entering the merchant's household, unskilled in the use of any instrument. It was Con rad, we know, who observing the musical bent of the lad's nature, and being strongly attached to all the national customs of Thu ringia, ordered a \"zither\" to be made for him in the toy-maker's village of Sonneberg. the head of which was probably carved with the image of the Holy Elizabeth, distributing the roses and lilies from her lap, as the heads of these same \" zithers \" are carved to tbe present day; and thus the quick-eared little fellow learnt within these old walls to accompany himself on the ancient Thuringian lute upon which Tannhauser himself is said to have played. Stored with such facts as these, how easy is it for the mind to conceive the time when the dame, left alone with little Martin in the halls of the big Cotta house on the \"Wednesday market place,\" \u2014 after Conrad had gone to the beer-house called the Paths Keller (according to the custom of his countrymen from time immemorial), to talk with his brother burghesses, upon the feudal and political grievances of the time \u2014 the boy would seat himself beside the kind-hearted Ursula, and wile away the time"], [215, "THE OLD CURREND SCHOOL. 199 in the long winter evenings by singing to her some such old Thuringian ditty as the following: \u2014 \"While seated on this bank of clover, my love hath tuned my zither strings. How can I then forget my lover, whose voice with softest music rings ? \" While seated on this bank of clover, my love with cherries me hath fed. How can I then forget my lover, whose lips than cherries are more red ? \" While seated on this bank of clover, we've heard the hum of honey-bee. How can I then forget my lover, than honey sweeter far to me ?\" Now let us change the picture and shift the time from the period when Martin Luther was a poor beggar-boy singing his carols in the streets, and crying \"Bread! for the love of God\" at the doors of the Eisenach citizens, till he must have died for the very want of what he begged for so solemnly, had it not been for the wondrous pity and goodness of the one fine noble-natured family whose history and loving-kindDess we have just recorded \u2014 and from this period let us pass to another important phase in the Reformer's life, when for the second time he found shelter within the town. It is well known, to all who have paid the least attention to the history of the Reformation, that Martin Luther, on his return from the Diet at Worms, after his memorable speech, concluding with the words, \u2014 \" On this book I take my stand ; I can do no other. God help me ! Amen,\" \u2014 when the Papists were seeking to compass the life of the so-called heretic monk, the undaunted Reformer, while sleeping under a beech-tree in the woods by Lie benstein, in the course of his journey homewards, was seized by a band of armed knights, and carried off he knew not whither, nor, indeed, for what purpose. This beech tree still exists, or rather half of the trunk cleft by lightning grows to this day, with merely a few branches sprouting from the top, beside the monument which has been set up within the last few years to commemorate the event. We ourselves have eaten our mid-day meal under the shade of its leaves, and as we write these words a small memento made out of a bit of the shat tered trunk of the tree itself, and presented to us by the pastor of Steinbach, stands upon our table. We have before said that Eisenach was destined to be a place of shelter to the Reformer twice in his life, and each at the most important epochs of his existence."], [216, "200 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Had Ursula Cotta not have taken him into her house at the time when he, as a boy, was famishing for the commonest neces saries of life, he assuredly must have died of hunger in the streets of the flinty-hearted town. Had Frederick the Wise, again, not have protected him against the fury of the Papists, he as assuredly must have perished at the stake ; and who, if either fate had be fallen him, would have been left to work out the Magna Charta of the Reformation ? Such accidents, indeed, as these in the life of one humble in dividual seem to our faith like the luminous writing of God's finger upon the wall, and such as no philosophy, dating all things from a \" fortuitous concourse of atoms \" can possibly account for. After having been carried off from under the beech-tree near Liebenstein, by the disguised knights of Frederick the Wise, the Reformer passed some months of his life in the eld Bitter-haus,"], [217, "THE OLD CURREND SCHOOL. 201 which still exists at the Wartburg. Here he laid aside his monk's frock and shaven crown, and let his beard grow, whde he passed by the name of Squire George \u2014 Junker Georg ; and here, while sitting in the little chamber, which was hardly bigger and better fitted than the cell of a modern model prison, the brave, cheerful Reformer amused himself by penning that translation of the Bible. which is the glory of his countrymen, and the foundation of the German language of the present day \u2014 and yet at the same time, in the childish superstition of his nature, holding imaginary con versations, in the solitude of that lone chamber, with the Devil himself ; (conversations which he himself has recorded in his own \" Table Talk ; \") and at length growing so exasperated with the sophistry of his Satanic Majesty, as to fling the leaden inkstand he had used for his Biblical translation at the head of the fiend \u2014 the marks of the blow being still shown, and newly blackened every year upon the wall for the edification of the sight-seers. The preceding illustration is copied from a photograph, taken by our son, of the interior of the Luther chamber at the Wart burg, as it now exists. Immediately above the table are to be seen hanging the miner's lamp, which is said to have belonged to Luther's father, as well as the portraits of Hans and Gretha Luther, the Reformer's pa rents ; while on the table itself, the swan is said to have served Martin for a paper-weight, and the little tin money-box to have been the original Currend-buchse with which the quondam choir boy was wont to beg for alms in the Eisenach streets. The huge mammoth bone on the floor, too, is stated to have been that which served him for a footstool. In these days of shows and sights, however, when even Grand Dukes love to turn a penny by the fabrication of Protestant relics, it is impossible to say which among the collection are shams, and which the real memorials of Luther's residence there. The \" identical \" table at which the Reformer is said to have penned his translation of the Bible, was an article that Martin's legs were never under ; while the bedstead, again, which is now pointed out by the guides, as being the very same in which Martin slept during his concealment at the Wartburg, is known to the Eisenach citizens to have replaced another \" real identical \" bedstead within the last twenty years."], [218, "CHAPTER XX. THE FOREST-SCHOOL AND FOREST-STUDENTS, THE F0RE8T-MEN, AND THE EXPENSE OF FUEL IN SAXONY. The Eisenach Forest-school bears a high reputation throughout Germany ; so high, indeed, that young men come from all parts to study at it. The sons of noblemen and the heirs of Ritter gut-besitzers (Anglice, yeomen) are sent to it to learn agriculture, so as to be able to farm their own estates ; and those even who are intended for forest-men in some distant Duchy, prefer to be taught the science of arboriculture at the Eisenach College rather than at any of the forest schools nearer their own country. The cost of attending the lectures here is 51 thalers, or \u00a37. 13s. per annum; so that, with 250 thalers (\u00a337 10s.) for board and lodging in the town, the average yearly expense of each student is about \u00a345 of our money. Previous to entering the forest-school, the student (who must have passed his exami nation at some one of the public seminaries) has to go as Forst ileve, or Lehrling, for a year into the woods to make himself practically acquainted with the character of the work to be per formed, under the guidance of some Revier forster, or forest-man of the district ; and for half-a-year more to study forest book keeping under some Ober-forster, for which he has to pay at the rate of 100 thalers (\u00a315) a-year, as a recompense for his board and lodging. After this, he comes to study, for another year and a half, the science and theory of the business at the University specially instituted for the purpose \u2014 the course of instruction consisting of arboriculture, agriculture, botany, geology, che mistry, mathematics, mechanics, and, indeed, of the better part of the physical sciences ; and in this stage he goes by the name of the Forst practikant, or forest practitioner. These forest-practitioners afiect the airs, and partly the cos-"], [219, "203 THE FOREST SCHOOL. tume, of the German university-students. Instead of the college black-velvet paletot, however, got up in the old Deutsch style, and all befrogged and belaced, the forest \" boys \" delight to sport a very short bright pea-green surtout, ornamented with green cord and shoulder-knots, for high days and holidays ; and a grey \" Juppe,\" as it is called, turned up with green, on ordinary occa- sions. When in full dress, they carry also a small short sword, called a Hirschfanger (literally a \" stag-catcher,\" or hunting- knife), stuck through one of the skirts of their coat ; and this, with a deer-stalker's hat, with the wing of some forest-bird ar- ranged on one side of it, and their legs encased in a pair of high hunting-boots, called Eannon Stiefel (from their being almost as long and big as a thirty-six pounder), constitutes their full hunt- ing costume. When the said Forst-practikant has finished his studies, and passed his examination at the college, he is fitted to become a \" forest-helper \" ( Fbrst-gehulfe), or assistant to some Revier-f bur- ster, under whom he receives a salary of 150 thalers (\u00a322 10s.) for the first five years, and 15 thalers extra every other five years that he continues in this capacity. Out of this munificent in- come he is expected to feed and clothe himself \u2014 his lodging as well as his fuel being found him gratuitously. As Forst- gehulfe, or Inspections-gehidfe, the novice has to remain five years at least; the latter post, however, is more that of a clerk than assistant- forester, for in such a situation the principal duties are keeping the forest accounts \u2014 work, nevertheless, that brings the Gehulfe double as much money yearly as ordinary forest work. True, that at the end of that time, if he is able to make either a first or second class examination, he is considered fit to be raised to the dignity of a Revier-fbrster (literally, a forester proper, with a cer- tain district to attend to) ; but he has, at the same time, to wait till a vacancy occurs, and this so seldom happens until ten years after making such an examination, that fifteen years is regarded as the usual time of service for a Forst- Gehulfe, If the Gehulfe, on the other hand, makes a bad examination, then he becomes Vnter-forster, as soon as there is such a post vacant, and above this rank there is but little chance of his rising ever after. As Unter-forster, or under-forester, the principal duties are to see that the orders of the Bevier forster are duly executed by the work-people, and to attend to the Jagd (literally, the hunt or chase, but in forest language restricted rather to shooting-excur sions, such sports as hunting being almost unknown throughout"], [220, "204 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Germany), and to take care that the Kreisers and Forstlaufers (forest-runners), beat up the game towards the spot where the Jagd, or Battue, is to take place. In this capacity the salary re ceived is 250 thalers, or \u00a337 10s. yearly, besides the use of a house and fuel gratis ; so that after remaining for fifteen years as Gehulfe, with an income of from \u00a322 10s. to \u00a327 10s., the assist ant at last obtains the magnificent addition of \u00a310 a-year to his means, and upon this pittance he is expected to live as a gentle man, content, for the rest of his days. Those, however, who have been lucky enough to pass, as we have said, a first or second class examination, are promoted to the higher dignity of Bevier-forster with the more liberal allowance of from 400 to 500 thalers (\u00a360 to \u00a375) per annum, besides fodder for a horse (even though no horse is kept, which is frequently the case, the said fodder being worth about 120 thalers, or \u00a318 more) as well as a house and fuel free of expense ; so that the income in this case may be estimated at very nearly \u00a3100 a-year, with gratuitous lodging and firing. In the capacity of Bevier-forster, or, literally, of forester pro per, with a certain Bevier, or district, of some 6000 or 7000 acres of forest-land to superintend, the official has to attend to the planting, thinning, pruning, and felling of the several trees in his district \u2014 to act as overseer to the under-foresters and the forest-runners, whose duty it is more particularly to look after the game, as well as to arrest all persons found collecting the broken twigs and branches at other than the appointed days, and all others caught cutting wood, or destroying the game at any time whatever \u2014 to see, too, that the citizens are duly supplied with the logs and faggots they require at the proper season of the year ; and, indeed, with the aid of the one or two assistants (Gehulfen), to take care that the wood-cutters and the labourers, whom he is allowed to employ, keep that portion of the forest, under his espe cial charge, in proper order \u2014 having such trees felled as the over-forester thinks it proper to come down, and planting others in the parts previously cleared, as well as pruning and attending to the healthy growth of such as are not yet fit for cutting. As Bevier-forster, another five years or more have generally to be passed before the official can expect to be promoted to the superior rank of Forst-itispector, or over-forester, in which capacity he has as many as four Beviers, or districts, and consequently the same number of Bevierfbrsters and under-foresters, to superin tend. It is his duty, more particularly, to keep all the forest-"], [221, "THE FOREST SCHOOL. 205 accounts, as to the money either accruing from the sale of timber, or required for the payment of the wages of the wood-cutters and labourers in the employ of the district-forester. For this purpose he has generally one or two Inspections-gehiilfe under him to act as clerks, besides a Lehrling, or Forst-6leve, who has come to learn this part of the forest business in his office. These over.foresters are generally obliged to keep two horses (such is the extent of ground they have to go over), for which the fodder is found them ; they have also a house and fuel free of expense, and a salary of 800 thalers (\u00a3120) each per annum. Now, the reader must not imagine that these foresters are in any way regarded as gardeners in the country ; on the contrary, they are considered to rank as thorough gentlemen ; and, there fore, thir salaries may be regarded as a type of the incomes of the first-class people in the land. Ober-forster, or Forst -inspect or, is the highest post to which a forester can, in the ordinary course, expect to rise ; for, though there is the office of Ober-forst Bath, or head of the forest uni versity, in connection with the institution, but one of the body can be elevated to such a rank, and this is always reserved for the most learned and distinguished member of the entire staff, on whom the education of the future corps of officials has to de pend. There is, likewise, one other Ober-forst Bath resident in Weimar. The salary attached to this office is as much as 3000 thalers per annum, or \u00a3450 of our money a sum which, in a country where the principal judges receive but \u00a3150 a-year, must be regarded as almost a munificent allowance, Moreover, attached to the same forest institution there is the post of Oberlandjdgermeister (i. e. head master of the hunt throughout the country) ; but this, on the other hand, is always reserved for some special court favourite \u2014 some landless Baron, or groschenless Graf, who has worked his way into the good graces of the \" petty powers that be \" by all manner of servile toadyism aud dirty intrigues. The income of this Jdgermeister in chief is about 1500 thalers the year, or \u00a3225 English ; so that, as this is one of the highest offices in the Grand-duchy, the reader will perceive how even the luckiest and proudest of the barons of Sax ony has not even the same salary as a reporter upon a first-class English daily newspaper. The necessity for such an elaborate institution as that above described proceeds from the continual increase iu the pric. of"], [222, "206 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. wood for fuel which occurs, year after year, throughout Germany ; so that the authorities are afraid that, unless the greatest care and knowledge be devoted to the culture of the forest lands, the people will, ere long, be left without a log to burn. While such a state of things is being brought about, the cost of the article keeps growing higher and higher every winter ; so that the day is not very far distant when even the citizens and the richer classes will be unable to afford the luxury of a few sticks to warm them in the bitter cold of the winter-time. The cost of wood per \" Elafter \" (which is a measure 6 ft. long, 6 ft. high, and 4 ft. broad, and therefore containing 144 cubic feet) is 15s. in the fo rests. To this the expense of carriage has to be added, and also that of cutting the logs into pieces small enough to be burnt in the stoves ; consequently, when the entire expense is summed up, the cost is generally about 7^ thalers, or \u00a31 2s. Gd., for the 144 cubic feet of fuel. At the prison the inmates are employed in cutting the logs into pieces fit for burning, and the authorities are in the habit of sup plying a Klafter of such ready-cut fuel for 8 thalers, or \u00a3 1 4s. The German stoves we found to consume, upon an average, about the eighth of a Elafter the week, so that the cost of heating one stove may be taken at a thaler, or 3s., weekly. Indeed, fuel is the principal expense of living on the Conti nent. In Paris we have burnt 5 francs' worth of wood (that is, five basketsful), at an hotel, in the course of one day; and still had our windows like panes of ground glass with the frost that was thick upon them. When our family first came to live in Eisenach, we laid in a stock of 5 Elafters of beech-logs, and 120 large bundles of faggots (for without the latter it is impossible to make the fires burn); and these cost us altogether (including carting, cutting, carrying, and stacking) within a fraction of 40 thalers, or \u00a36 sterling. The stock was stored in our wood-house in the beginning of April, and by the month of October there was not a stick of it left ; so that for the maintenance merely of the kitchen fire, and the heating of the house only at the end of the spring and the beginning of autumn, it cost us at the rate of 5s. a-week for twenty-four weeks, at the warmest period of the year. Say, therefore, that the expenses for fuel were double this amount during the other portion of the year (and English people who think the cold very severe if the snow remains a fortnight on the ground at Christmas time, have no notion of the length and severity of the German winters, where the earth is often as white"], [223, "THE FOREsT-SCHOOL. 207 as a twelfth cake for four months at a stretch), and we thus have tho sum of \u00a318 per annum for the cost of warming one family. What may be the cost of fuel in German households it is diffi cult of course to tell, but so far as we could learn each stove of an ordinary size was generally considered to consume between two or three Elafters of wood in the year ; and this at the rate of 7 J thalers the Elafter (including the expenses of cutting and stacking), and three thalers odd for 60 bundles of faggots, brings the gross amount to about 20 thalers, or \u00a33 per annum. That this is even less than the average consumption we know from our own observations, as to the quantity of fuel delivered to the mil liners and to the Appellations-Gericht-Rath (for one must never forget to give a German his full yard of small titles), who hap pened to live above and below us in the house we occupied, during the latter part of our residence in the Thuringian capital ; and the amount, moreover, nearly agrees with our own estimate of \u00a3 1 8 per annum, for five fires daily in our own family. Germans, however, who eat, cook, and live in one \"Eoch stube \" in the winter, seldom or never lay out more than \u00a33 a-year, or 20 thalers, for fuel ; nevertheless, add this, small sum as it is, to the rest of their expenses \u2014 and remember that the cost of firing when even but one stove is heated, takes at least a fifteenth part of an average income of the middle classes \u2014 and the English reader will be still better able to see how little money these people must have left, after defraying the heavy cost of amusements and other unnecessary expenses, for those necessi ties of life, which are the only means of giving activity and energy to the great bulk of every nation. But this large expense for fuel is, after all, by no means neces sary. Coal, even in the heart of Germany, is but little dearer than it is in England ; the hundredweight in Eisenach costs but 12 groschens, or about Is. 2Jd. of our money, and the ton be tween 7 and 8 thalers, or 21s. to 24s. English. Nevertheless, the people (as with us in the days of Charles II. \u2014 when Acts were passed to prohibit the burning of the \"filthy smoky ma terial\" which was supposed to evolve some specially poisonous gases during its combustion), object, to this day, to use what they call \"stone charcoal\" in their stoves, urging that it makes the rooms smell of sulphur ; and the consequence is that an ex pensive legion of useless philosophic cultivators of forests has to be maintained \u2014 Universities kept up for their instruction \u2014 pen sions paid to the Grand Toady who happens to be made the"], [224, "208 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Hunting-Master-iu-chief (whose place at best is but a mere political sinecure)\u2014 and, what is worse than all, immense tracts of land that might serve, if not for the raising of corn, at least for the grazing of sheep, to give something like muscle and stamina to the lethargic, half-starved race, are now left for square mile after square mile covered with forests; and that mainly because the Grand Duke of the principality, and the swarm of half-barbarian barons, who are ever dancing hke lac queys at his heels, may have the enjoyment of destroying and selling the game (for your Grand Duke is always the chief poul terer in every petty German State), which such a wilderness naturally engenders. Indeed, one of the principal duties of the above-mentioned forest-men is not only to attend to the forest lands, but, as we have said, to make themselves acquainted with the haunts of the wild fowl, hares, deer, and roebucks in their district ; as well as to have the forest-rnnners in readiness at a moment's call whenever it may please his Serene Highness to invite his court to a day's shooting in the woods. Whereupon the University students, who have been compelled to go through no end of courses of science for the purpose, have to see that the Forst-laufers and Ereisers under their direction beat all the game within a certain circle towards the central point, where the clever and lively sportsmen happen to be stationed ; and where each of the \" crack shots \" stands with a gun at his shoulder and an eye glass to his eye, ready to destroy the birds or beasts as they chance to come near \u2014 the result being that the several animals thus slaughtered are sold to those taking part in the sport for the due augmentation of the Grand Duke's paltry revenues. Nor is this the only evil of this same Forest Institution. Were the learned professors at the head of these Forest Col leges to be engaged in combating, rather than upholding the prejudices of their countrymen, and in teaching them, what they know as well as we do, that a pound of coal during its combustion gives off far more heat than a pound of wood, the rearing of trees to be used simply for fuel by the community, could not fail to disappear in a very few years from the land. On the contrary, however, the Forest Institution is maintained simply because it opens up places of patronage for a large number of the sons of the \"beggar barons,\" who still are proud enough to look upon any work or handicraft as a disgrace, and barbarous enough to believe that a fife in the woods is the only fit occupation for nobility."], [225, "THE FOREST-SCHOOL. 209 Let us, however, endeavour to estimate what is the cost of this same Forest Institution to Saxe-Weimar alone. A large pro portion of the woods belonging to the Grand Duchy are situate iu the Thuringian forest. To the English reader, however, the term Thuringia will convey hardly any definite idea of the locality, seeing that in our maps of Germany no such territory is to be found delineated. Thuringia, then, let us say, is that portion of central Germany which lies between Nordhausen and Coburg to the north and south, aud between Gerstiuigen (by Eisenachl aud Halle to the east and west The whole area comprised within these limits is very nearly 20,000 English square miles, and of this about J 500 square miles, or one-thirteenth of the whole, is forest-land to this day. Formerly the lords of the Wartburg had sovereign sway over the entire extent of this territory, aud they therefore bore the title of the Landgraves of Thuringia. It now, however, constitutes the dominions of many a petty duchy, being parcelled out principally among Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Coburg- Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen, and Saxe-Altenburg ; while even the kings of Prussia, Saxony, and Bavaria have also a finger in the pretty little \" dirt-pie.\" Indeed, the Thuringian forest, though as nearly as possible equal in size only to our own county of Suffolk, is divided among as many as ten petty princes ; and yet the population of the whole is hardly so large as that of an Eng lish manufacturing town, like Birmingham, with merely a mayor and a city-corporation to keep the people in order. The extent of the woods possessed by Saxe-Weimar in the Thuringian forest is not quite 100 English square miles. But this is not the only forest-land appertaining to the Grand Duchy ; some other forests are situate in the isolated Alstddter circle, lying to the north of the Weimar, and between Nord hausen and Halle ; besides, there are the woods in the district of Weida, near Neustadt, and also those at Blankenhain and Ettersberg, more immediately in the neighbourhood of Weimar itself; all of which together may be taken at nearly double the extent of the woodlands belonging to the same duchy in the Thuringian forest. Hence, the entire area of the forest-land possessed by the Grand Duchy may be stated in round numbers at between 200 and 250 English square miles ; and this estimate agrees very nearly with the amount given, by multiplying the average size of the districts which the Revier-forsters have to superintend, by the gross number of such Reviers distributed throughout the country. There are, then, 28 such Reviers or 14"], [226, "1 210 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. forest districts in Saxe-Weimar, the ordinary extent of which may be stated at between 5000 and 6000 acres ; so that multi plying these amounts together we have a total of 140,000 to 168,000 acres; and then, dividing these by 640 (the number of acres to a square mile), we get a quotient of 218| to 250 English square miles, for the gross area comprised within the forest districts of the Grand Duchy. Consequently, in stating that the forest land of Saxe-Weimar is between 200 and 250 square miles in extent we cannot err very widely from the fact. Hence, as the entire Saxe-Weimarish territory consists only of 1419 square miles, and near upon 240 of these are woodland, it follows that almost one-sixth of the whole domain is forest. Fuel increases yearly in price throughout Germany ; indeed, so dear has it become in Saxony, that were it not that the poor are allowed by law to go twice every week (Tuesday and Friday) into the forests, and break off such dead twigs and branches as they can from the trees, a great portion, if not the whole, of the labouring class must perish from cold, owing to their inability to purchase so expensive a commodity. The time thus wasted by the poorer workmen in going some five English miles to and from the forests, and bringing home respectively only such a bundle as they can carry strapped round their back, every person of the least common sense can readily estimate. Two hours' walk to the woods and two hours' home for two days a-week, makes nearly one working day lost in the course of the seven by every one of the poor in Eisenach ; and that in having to do work individually, which a wagon would perform for them collec tively with much greater ease, and with far less waste of labour too. Moreover, though the law prohibits the poor from using any axe or bill-hook, or, indeed, from cutting, by any means, the healthy branches from the trees ; nevertheless, in a country where fuel is so dear, the temptation to violate the legal restric tions becomes so cogent with the needy, that not a few resort to the practice ; for notwithstanding the people are forbidden, under heavy penalties, to sell any of the faggots which they thus collect, of course such a custom prevails, and there is not a servant in the town who cannot inform her mistress when in want of Reissig, as it is called (some dry wood for the lighting of fires), where a plentiful supply can be immediately procured. The price usually paid to these poor people for the wood they bring (in the dark) to the house is a farthing for a large bundle of twigs, and about o^d. fur a big basket of thick broken branches"], [227, "THE FOREST-SCHOOL. 211 \u2014 such prices being, perhaps, some 25 per cent, cheaper than if the fuel were purchased in the ordinary manner. Not only is the waste of time and labour here the great social drawback, but owing to the temptation which the poor have to violate the laws in connection with such matters, imprisonment after imprison ment occurs in the town, so that those who should be trained as honest, self-reliant workmen are educated as \"jail-birds,\" and taught to care little for the penal terrors of a prison. Indeed, one of the most peculiar, if not revolting sights, in the neighbourhood of Eisenach, is to see the poor people on the ap pointed days, wending their way home from the woods \u2014 men, women, and even little children \u2014 each bearing such an enormous faggot on their backs, that, when you see them for the first time, it seems as if the very bundle of dried twigs had become animated ; and that the huge faggots were walking towards you. For bending, as the miserable creatures do, under their load, it is impossible to distinguish anything like a human form in the distance. Many of these bundles carried home by the poor are from 6 feet to 8 feet high, and as big round as a water-butt ; and in the depth of winter, with the snow many a foot thick upon the ground, it is one of the most saddening of spectacles to behold the half-clad, half-starved, shuddering, wretched beings, often twelve abreast, come staggering along the road. The fact is, as we said before, the forests of Thuringia are maintained solely to keep up the supply of game for the Grand Duke, and to find places for the half-barbarous nobles who, to this day, scorn commerce and handiwork, and think a wild hunter's occupation the only one consistent with their imaginary dignity. Indeed, these forest students in the town of Eisenach are one of the chief nuisances of the place. The students are divided into two classes \u2014 the Adels, or nobles, as the one party style themselves, and the Caffres, or savages, as the commoners are generally denominated. The so-called nobles are in the habit of dining at the \" Thuringer Hof,\" at the cost of sixpence per head, whereas the Caffres frequent the \" Gar-kiiche,\" or cook shop, where they are wont to get their dinner for threepence. Such an opprobrious division of society is, of course, the cause of all kinds of petty disputes and ill-feelings among youths, many of whom have not yet arrived at years of discretion. The con sequence is that duels are continually taking place among the boys, and in our own time we heard of some half-dozen such encounters almost every session. These duels are usually fought"], [228, "212 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. with rapiers or straight swords, \u2014 very thin and very sharp \u2014 the right arm, the throat, and bowels of the combatants being covered with padding, so that no mortal wound may be inflicted, while the eyes are protected with spectacles. Such encounters last fifteen minutes, or till one of the combatants has his face so slit by the weapon of the other that he is unable to continue fighting for the blood streaming into his eyes. During our stay in the town one young man had his cheek cut open; another his under-lip nearly taken off; a third his scalp cut in two ; and a fourth the tip of his nose so excised that the end of his nasal organ lay upon the ground. This was afterwards picked up and duly sewn and strapped on to the remainder of the feature, with which it had every likelihood of being again incor porated ; when, unfortunately, the forest-man was looking through a telescope at the \" Hohe Sonne,\" and some one happened to jog his arm with such force that the end of the unhealed organ was once more severed from the bridge, or \" saddle,\" as the Germans call it ; whereupon the gentleman picked up the tip of his nose, and put it in his porte-monnaie as a trophy of his prowess, de lighting to carry it about with him and show it to his friends for many a day afterwards. It is but just to add that such silly, though serious, encounters are forbidden by the authorities of the town ; they are, however, mostly conducted in secret, the duels being fought hi the neighbouring woods, or in a private room at one of the taverns, towards the close of each session. And it is the custom of the friends of the wounded person to keep watch over him day and night, one set relieving the other, and applying ice to the injured part, so as to prevent any signs of inflammation setting in, while a ban-el of beer is kept in one corner of the room for the refreshment of the attendants. One gentleman was in the habit of walking about Eisenach who was well known to have killed his man (or rather his boy) at Jena, and to have cut out the eye of another young student ; and yet this worthy duellist could but barely have attained his majo rity. Nor is it at all unusual to meet with Germans minus one ear, or with their noses slit down the middle like a rabbit's, or else their cheeks tattooed with scars like a Botecudo Indian. Another evil arising from this Forest Institution of Eisenach is the feud that is continually going on between the military offi cers and the forest students in the city, owing to the one class considering itself superior to the other. The first year of our stay in Thuringia some Tyrolean singers happened to come to the"], [229, "THE FOREST-SCHOOL. 213 city and to give a concert at the Mohren \u2014 a tavern that the offi cers and forest practitioners were in the habit of attending nightly. The principal of these singers were ladies of the most question able virtue, possessing far more impudence than musical talent, and therefore especially attractive to the boys who had assembled to hear them. We happened to have been present on the occa sion, and found the forest-men seated in one room and the officers in an adjoining one (for the two seldom condescend to fraternize), and with the singers located at a table between the apartments. In a short time each began vieing with the other as to calling for champagne for the ladies ; and when several bottles had been emptied by each of the parties (and they were both alike heated with the drink), a noise ensued between one of the forest-men and the officers as to some undue attention paid to the females in question. In a minute the whole tavern was in an uproar ; forest-men in a body wrangling with the officers, who, in their turn, sided each with the other against the students. For a few minutes the broil was confined merely to noisy blusterings. After a time, however, one of the young students was rash enough to strike one of the officers in the face ; whereupon the soldier drew the sword which he had always in readiness at his side (for the weapon is carried to the beer-house as well as the ball-room), and struck the boy with it over the head. Then the row (for there is no other word for it) became general, and most uproarious. Cards were exchanged apparently all round \u2014 the lady musicians fled \u2014 the police were called in, and the ta vern cleared. The next day the Foresters held a private meeting, after their attendance at the morning's lecture, and came to the conclusion to go down in a body that evening to the Mohren armed with their Hirsch-fdnger (large hunting-knives, or, more properly, short swords), so that they might be fairly matched with the officers in case of another dispute. The police, however, had heard of their intention, and the offi cers doubtlessly had been apprized to the same effect ; for the latter, like gentlemen, thought it more honourable to keep away, than embroil themselves farther with a host of boys ; while the Polizei officials mustered in full force. The fracas, therefore, came to a peaceful end, nothing further being done than the \" rustication \" of the forest student who had struck the officer \u2014 while the officer who had cut the forester down was sent away to enjoy himself at some fortress or other for a few months."], [230, "CHAPTER XXI. STUDENT LIFE AT JENA. There are altogether twenty-seven Universities distributed throughout Germany, at which, in round numbers, some 20,000 young men are continually studying, and for the teaching of whom, some 2000 and odd professors are regularly employed. Now, the population of all Germany, may be roughly estimated at 40,000,000 souls; and of these a fourth part, or 10,000,000 may, perhaps, be taken as the entire body of youths under twenty one years old. So that dividing the gross number of males who are under age by the entire body of youths studying at these Universities, we find that oue boy in every 500 receives a College education in Deutschland. We cannot tell what may be the proportion in England, and indeed, we know of no official returns that would enable us to come to such a conclusion. At Cambridge and Oxford (we find from the \" calendars \") the number of students maybe taken roughly at 1500, respectively, or at 3000, altogether; and perhaps, with the other Colleges throughout the country (such as the London University, King's College, Durham College, Hailey bury, Homerton, and the several collegiate institutions for par ticular sects), the sum of the University students in England may be roughly taken at 7000, or one-third those of all Germany. But then it should be remembered that the population of England alone (for we are excluding even Wales from the calculation) is but little more than one-third of the people throughout Deutsch land ; so that the proportion of those receiving a University edu cation with us may be said to be about the same as it is in the Fatherland, or as one youth in every 500. The German students must not, in any way, be confounded with those of the higher English Universities ; for the youths at the Deutsch Colleges are, for the greater part, the sons merely of"], [231, "STUDENT LIFE AT JENA. 215 second-rate middle-class families, such as publicans, butchers, chandlers-shopkeepers, chemists and druggists, well-to-do pea sants, and the like. Indeed, owing to the cheapness of matri culating at such institutions in Deutschland, the class of youths who attend them approximates more to the university students of Scotland, where it is the ambition of every small farmer to make a \" minister \" of some one of his sons ; for the German \" boys \" in no way resemble the \" men \" at Oxford and Cambridge, whither, owing to the great expense of the course of study, only the children of the richest in the land can be sent. The reader, therefore, in our after description, must bear this distinction continually in mind ; otherwise, when he learns that it is the custom of these \" boys \" to sit at their convivial meetings mostly in their shirt-sleeves, and to do certain other acts of which the lowest Oxford or Cambridge \"man\" could never be guilty, he may fancy we are painting a general coarse picture, from some extraordinary vulgar exceptions. Moreover, when the stranger reads in Murray's Handbook for Northern Germany, that \" groups of the Jena students, in falling collars not parti cularly clean\" (such things, however, are no longer worn), \"and flowing hair not particularly glossy, may be seen swaggering about the streets with foils, masks, and cudgels,\" (we never saw any cudgels,) the account may sound somewhat harsh to those who would contrast it with the appearances of the young men to be met with in our first-class University towns. Nevertheless, when we remember that the German students are the sons, generally, of small master-tradesmen, government-clerks, or pea sant proprietors, and review what has already been said in these pages as to the manners even of the higher forms of middle-class life in Deutschland, it will be seen at a glance that, severe as the sketch may appear, the hneaments are by no means too harsh. However, dismissing all such class-distinctions from our mind, it must be admitted that there is no slight amount of poetic feeling (sentimental though it be) \u2014 no small modicum of the romantic, chivalrous spirit of old \u2014 no little ardour in the patriotic aspirations for the union and well-being of the Fatherland \u2014 and, indeed, no ordinary extent of religious zeal, underlying the Burschenschaft institutions of the German Universities. And we must confess, on the other hand, that such principles and feelings are utterly unknown among the adolescent members of our own Colleges. Granted that no practical good \u2014 and, indeed, as we believe, much social evil comes of it \u2014 still, the evil is in"], [232, "216 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. no way intended, and the design of such institutions has a poetic, chivalrous, and even religious spirit about it which we cannot but commend ; even though the ultimatum of it be but the singing of pot-glorious songs, the excision of noses and incision of cheeks in boyish duels, and the guzzling of barrels of small beer to the honour and glory of brotherly love and eternal friendship and truth. There is no equivalent English word for the term Burschen schaft, above used. Literally translated, it signifies boyship, but in the student vernacular it stands for those congregations of college \" Boys\" who have formed themselves into some club or closed society, for the working out of certain principles which they believe to be either for the general benefit of their country, or for the individual welfare and honour of their brother students. Such closed societies are of very ancient origin ; and though at present these student-clubs date as far back only as the year 1815, there is not the least doubt that this period was merely the era of the revival of those institutions which the governors of the country had previously suppressed. The Uni versity of Jena dates as far back as the middle of the sixteenth century (a.d. 1548); it was indeed one of the first collegiate establishments founded by the Princes of Saxony (by Johann Friedrich \"the Magnanimous\"), after the publication of that celebrated protest of the Saxon Elector and his allies against the edict of the Catholic Diet of Speier, which gave the Reformers the name of \" Protestants\" ever afterwards; and probably such closed societies had then a specially religious object, as a means of uniting and strengthening the first Lutheran youths in those principles which had led to the downfall of the papal power in Germany. It will be found, too, that to this day these \" Boy clubs\" or Burschenschaft institutions have no little religion mixed up, even with their drinking customs ; for as Martin Luther himself is known to have hated the pretended asceticism of the old monks, as much as he was sworn against the feigned chastity of the Romish priesthood, and to have been a \" right jovial fellow\" in his love of the pleasures of life, after he had de nounced \"the Pope and all his works\" \u2014 so that the couplet of his, saying \" Who loves not woman, wine, and song, Remains a fool his whole life long :\""], [233, "STUDENT LITE AT JENA. 217 has come to be a proverb throughout Deutschland \u2014 even so, doubtlessly, that commingling of drinking and singing with sacred and patriotic principles, which is the marked character of the student-clubs of the present day, dates most likely as far back as the origin of the Reformation itself. There are three such Burschenschaft institutions in Jena, each of such societies having special principles to work out, and all of them being distinguished by certain colours, displayed either in the striped ribbon (called the \" band\") which the mem- bers wear across their breast, or in the bit of similarly-striped ribbon dangling from their watch (called the Bier-zipfel, or beer-lappet) ; or else in the colours of the gold-embroidered cap, which is like an inverted flowerpot-saucer in shape, and worn immediately over the right temple, rather than on the crown of the head \u2014 being kept in its place by means of a small piece of elastic that is slipped over the back of the skull. This is known by the name of their \" cerevis- (or beer-) cap,\" and it is customary for the Boys to swear by it ; for instead of attesting any solemn declaration by the words, \" upon their honour,\" or \" upon their 'davy,\" after the manner of other youths, it is the habit of the Jena students to vouch for the truth of any point that may be doubted, \" upon their grand cerevis \" (Latin, cerevisia, \"beer\") or their \"little cerevis,\" according to the importance of the occasion. But it will be seen by the curious beer-usages given hereafter, that it is forbidden for any student to pledge his grand cerevis to a negative proposition ; that is to say, he dare not assure any one that he did not see or hear such aud such a thing, by means of this form of adjuration. For, say the beer- laws, with all the pomposity of an Act of Parliament, at \u00a7 19, \" as the grand cerevis takes the place of an oath, so must it not be used thoughtlessly. Moreover, a positive fact only can be certified by the grand cerevis, and it must never be given to attest the truth of a negative one\" (nie darf das negative Cerevis gegeben werden). Each of such student-clubs, or Burschenschaft institutions, has, moreover, not only its distictive tricoloured ribbons and cerevis-caps, but its special monogram, or literal device, made up of the initials of the words standing for the main principles which it is respectively sworn to uphold ; and such device is worked in gold-thread on the crown of the cerevis-caps worn by the members of the club, and also in the centre of the large silk-flag, which is kept by the Fahne-wart (banner-warden) of"], [234, "218 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the society, and carried at the head of the unions during any grand procession. These same monograms, moreover, are chalked on the floor of the hall, previous to any duel being fought, so as to mark the sides or places of the two combatants. There are, at the present time, three such student-clubs ex isting in Jena, and these are as follows ; \u2014 1. The \"Armins,\" or \" Arminians,\" whose colours are black, red, and gold ; the word here printed in italics being expressive of the distinctive hue by which the members of the club are characterized ; that is to say, their caps are of a scarlet tint, with merely a narrow stripe of black and gold round the band of them. These \" boys \" have for their motto the words \u2014 \" Freedom:, Honour, and Fatherland ! \" The monogram for which (made up of the initials of the three German words) is as under : \u2014 2. The \"Germans,\" or \" Germanians ;\" who have for their colours a white ground, with a border of black, red, and gold, and whose motto is \u2014 \" G-od, Freedom, Honot/b, and Fatherland ! \" The monogrammatic device of the club being \u2014"], [235, "STUDENT LIFE AT JENA. 219 3. The \" Teutons \" or \" Teutonians ; \" and these have blue for their principal colour, and white and gold for the additional hues, while the words of their motto are \u2014 \" Long live the Circle of Teutonia ! \" And whose monogram is consequently \u2014 Now, the cerevis-cap above described, emblazoned with the gold monogram on the crown, and with a border of golden vine- leaves running round the side of it, constitutes, together with the tricoloured ribbon across the breast, and the like tricoloured Bier- zipfel dangling from the watch in the waistcoat-pocket, the principal characteristics of the costume, not only of a Jena stu- dent, but of those belonging to the Burschenschaft institutions at the other Universities of Germany ; for such student-clubs are not peculiar to the Saxe-Weimar College alone, but ramify through- out the colleges of the entire country. Add, then, to the above distinctive articles of student costume, a pair of Eanonen-stiefel \u2014 or, in other words, hunting boots, as long as a cannon \u2014 and a short black-velvet surtout got up in the \" old German '' style, all be-frogged, and be-braided, and be-laced, and with festoons of plaited cord dangling from each shoulder, after the fashion of a footman's aiguillettes ; and the reader will have a tolerably-vivid notion of a German student in \" full dress,\"\u2014 especially if he con- ceives the Bursche to carry a lady's grey-checked shawl folded upon one arm, and an ivory-headed and ivory-tipped cane in the hand ; for each and all of such articles \u2014 from the punnet-like cap down to the ivory-tipped walking-stick \u2014 are the indispensable accompaniments of every Jena student, pretending to the least \" style \" at the present day."], [236, "220 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Here, however, is an engraving, copied from a photograph by Herr Schenk of Jena, of such a university-student \" got up \" in the latest fashions of the time. To become a member of these Burschenschaft institutions, is a matter that is beset with some slight difficulty. In the first place, no foreigners are ever permitted to enter the select circle; since they are supposed to have nothing in common with the in terests of the Fatherland. True, strangers are allowed to join the club, as tolerated members, but they are never suffered to take any active part in the business of it ; nor can they so much as wear the red, blue, or white cerevis-cap peculiar to the members of one or other of the Burschenschaft institutions. Moreover,"], [237, "STUDENT LIFE AT JENA. 221 even the youths who are natives of the country have to undergo a six-mouths' course of probation, before they can be admitted as regular rnenibers to the society ; and if, during the probationary term, their company or their principles be found to be uncongenial to the rest of the youths, they are politely informed, at the end of their novitiate, that there are certain secret objections to their joining the club. Nor is such a novice even allowed to enter upon the course of probation, until the code of the laws, as well as the declaration of the principles of the union in question, have been placed in the hands of the candidate for admission, so that he may study them at his leisure ; and it is only after the youth has had several days to ponder over the whole matter, that he is asked whether he is inclined to subscribe to them, and feels that he has strength and will enough to uphold them. Further, there are still other sacrifices to be made. Not only has every member of the club to give up a certain percentage of all the money sent to him by his parents, for the maintenance of the society (the usual amount contributed by each being about 40 thalers, or \u00a36, each half-year), but he is also bound to devote considerable time to attending the various drinking-bouts, con ferences, fencing-exercises, and duels, in which the members of the union have to take part. He is expected, indeed, to be pre sent at each of the drinking-bouts, which occur twice every week and last from eight till ten in the evening, and also to conform to all the drinking ceremonies usual on such occasions ; and though he is not strictly bound to join in the Ex-kneipe (additional weekly or fortnightly drinking-bout) which is generally held somewhere in the suburbs, on the Sunday evenings during each Semester, or half-yearly course of study, it would, nevertheless, be considered \" unboylike\" not to do so. Again, he must be present every day for an hour or two at the \" fencing loft,\" and practise there dili gently with the small-swords, so as to qualify himself to defend his own honour, or that of any brother, in case of emergency. Over and above this, too, he must be ready to take part in the watch at the bedside, when any brother member of the society has been seriously wounded in a Mensur (or measuring of wea pons), \u2014 for such is the usual German phrase for a duel. Nor is this all. The member of such a Burschenschaft institution has to be present at every meeting called by the \" Sprecher,\" or speaker, of the society ; such meetings being always secret ones, and held with closed doors, within which none even of the tole rated members are allowed to enter. These occur often twice and"], [238, "222 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. thrice in the week, and continue no short time ; so that the repeated inroads upon the time of a youth who has come to the University to study are such as to make the attention to the club business a matter of no slight sacrifice on his part. However, the student before joining any such Burschenschaft society is tolerably- well acquainted with what will be expected of him ; nevertheless, many are the Boys who, after uniting them selves with one or other of the student-clubs, are forced to lapse into mere tolerated members, owing to their inability to conform to the rules of the union as well as to meet the expenses of it. Let us suppose, however, that a youth has just had his name placed by his parents on the College-books, and that he has expressed a wish, to some friend whom he knows, to enrol himself as a member of the Arminian Burschenschaft \u2014 a society with which we profess to have more particular acquaintance than with any other ; for it is the peculiar custom at Jena and other such institutions, that he who fraternizes with one club cannot be per mitted to associate with the members of another ; so that on visiting the town the stranger must do, as we were obliged to do, i. e., select his friends, and abide by them, since every society is utterly distinct from, if not absolutely at war with, almost every cither. Well, we will suppose, as we said before, that the new-comer has chosen, like us, the Armins for his friends ; and then, after having taken part, for some few nights, in the drinking-bouts with the \" Boys,\" he has a copy of the principal laws placed in his hand for his due consideration and adoption, before being admitted within the exclusive circle. We asked to be allowed to make ourselves acquainted with the character of such rules ; and though it was by no means usual for strangers to have such a privilege vouchsafed to them, the favour was at length granted, and we were furnished with the following curious abstract of the leading tenets of the institution in question. We should add, however, for our own credit sake, that we are guilty of no breach of faith in the publication of them ; since we stated at the time that our object was to make the English public, in some measure, acquainted with the principles of societies to which they were utter strangers. We were informed, at the same time, that the matter supplied to us was merely a portion of what the members had to subscribe ; but whether the rest was with-"], [239, "STUDENT LIFE IN JENA. 223 held on account of its being a mere matter of uninteresting form, or because it was of a more private and secret nature, we are not in a position even to conjecture. As it was given to us, so do we present it to the reader. Introduction to the Rules of the Arminian Club at Jena. Convinced that the noble self-consciousness of the German nation \u2014 their brotherly love and their desire for national unity (now that the latter feeling has been newly awakened by the late glorious wars for liberty) \u2014 must meet with a lively expression on the part of the academic youths of Jena, a considerable number of the students accordingly founded and joined, on the 12th June, 1815, the institutions now known as the Burschenschaft. They felt satisfied that any academic union, which would be fitting to the purpose and principles of the University, must necessarily be based upon that high spirit which alone can ensure that which, after God-seeking, is the holiest and noblest aspira tion of man : the freedom and independence of our Fatherland. This union was named by them the Burschenschaft, or Guild of Boys. Therefore, the first and holiest object of the Guild of Boys was to give fresh life and vigour to German customs and feelings ; to excite German energy, as well as to promote chastity ; to induce their compatriots, in their common love of the Fatherland, to sacrifice every worldly interest to it ; to give up to war and destruc tion every power which opposed the freedom and independence of the nation ; to annihilate every base sentiment that was antago nistic to the proper regulation and diffusion of such a high minded spirit ; and, finally, to bring about the re-establishment of concord and brotherly love among the University students Whoever struggles for so high an object can tolerate only the society of brave and honourable youths. Therefore, as the first condition necessary for the attainment of such ends, the founders of the Guild of Boys demanded of each member, who was desirous of belonging to it, compliance with the following forms of existence : \u2014 Moral living ; stern upholding of personal dignity; and acting in cons ormity with a true, manly, and chivalrous spirit, such as knows how to defend, and how to maintain, right and honour, at the cost even of life or blood. By these principles of patriotism, morality, and nobility, the"], [240, "224 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Boys' Guild increased and became stronger and stronger, despite of every impediment, and the machinations of those who worked with ill-will against it. It grew to be a power, important and salutary, for the development of patriotic life. It has maintained itself, through the infusion of an ideal spirit into the youths of the country, even to this day, despite the alteration of the times. Now we, the members of the Boys' Guild called Arminia, assembling at the Borough-Cellar, are faithful and true suc cessors of the original Boys' Guild in Jena. We have not only immutably kept its external marks of dis tinction, but we have also lineally inherited its spirit. We acknow ledge its aim to be the most generous of all objects, as well as the most worthy for the academic youths of this period to endeavour to carry out ; and we adhere to the idea of its principles with unshaken fidelity. In order, therefore, to accomplish our purpose the more surely, \u2014 to put an end to all individual dissension, and to bring about the perfect rule and regulation of our Boys' Guild, we have, after careful and mature consideration, set down the following laws, as the basis of our constitution, and as the fundamental principles to which all our members are expected to subscribe. \u00a7 1. We devote our life and strength to the service of the united German Fatherland. For the welfare of Germany, we will cul tivate our youthful energies with earnestness and perseverance ; for the freedom and independence of Germany, we will stand up with manly courage ; for the unity of Germany we will work with one heart and soul. And for what we have thus striven in our youth, we hereby pledge our faith to defend and promote zea lously, with all our bodily aud mental strength, when we are men and citizens. \u00a7 2. Therefore, this Boys' Guild being in its constitution, and aspi ration essentially a German fraternity, in the best sense of the word, those students only should be admitted to it, who are the sons, not alone of German parents, but of citizens of the German Fatherland. Nevertheless, considering that there are nations, the people of which, though belonging to an extraneous body-politic,"], [241, "STUDENT LIFE AT JENA. 225 partake of the German nature, on account of their having been born to the German language, aud educated after German man ners, we cheerfully receive into our union students of this kind, upon the understanding that they are willing to subscribe to the German patriotic principle set down in Sect. 1\" \u2014 although they are expected to do this, only so far as it agrees with their extra- German patriotic views. \u00a73. Bearing in mind the endeavours of the original Boys' Guild to combine the whole of the academic youths of Germany into one large patriotic uuion, we regard this as the object for which we are to strive with all our force \u2014 \" that is to say, to bring together the scattered elements of the real and united student mind, throughout all Germany, and first of all in Jena.\" So, further, do we declare, that we will never acknowledge, but rather com bat, by all means in our power, every society opposed to the aim and object of the student-union ; especially the so-called \"Husbandmen\" (Oekonom) and \"Corps\" who are a type of a base life among students, and animated by no sense of patriotism whatever. \u00a74. Upon each member of the Student Guild a moral and honour able mode of action and thought are enforced as a duty. This, indeed, can be the only foundation of every noble aim, and by such means alone can the respect and honour of the whole Stu dent Guilds be secured. In particular, the preservation of chas tity is demanded of the members as a national aud truly German virtue, in accordance with the pure and holy purpose of the Student Guilds. \u00a75. In all matters of honour we regard the duel as a purifying ordeal; that is to say, we consider that by such means the student has restored to him the honour which, in the eyes of his fellow-students, had been injured by some opprobrious of fence. Therefore, every one belonging to our society is obliged 15"], [242, "226 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. not only to purifv his own honour with the customary weapons, provided he can obtain no other satisfaction for the wrong that has been done to him, but, in order to comply with the principle of justness, he is expected to be ever ready to give satisfaction to those whose honour he has injured, and that with such weapons as his adversary may select. Nevertheless, the Students' Guild makes it a special duty to endeavour to prevent, by all fitting means, any wanton provocation being offered by its members to those of another society. \u00a76. In order to manifest also in our outward appearance that we are the true successors of the ancient Student Guild, we maintain to this day, as the only colours of our banner, the \"venerable black, red, and gold.'' Further, the sole object of oui- ambition we ex press in the following words : \u2014 \" Honour, Freedom, and the Fatherland ;\" and by that motto we will ever bear in mind that as our inward honour is our holiest good, so, also, will we devote our property and our life-blood to the defence of what we value quite as highly \u2014 the outward honour of our country ; and even so, indeed, will we give up our whole energies to our Fatherland, for which, alone, we will live and die. \u00a77 Satisfied, moreover, after mature consideration, that these laws, in their integrity, constitute the intrinsic conditions of every well regulated Student Guild, we declare they shall ever be regarded as sacred, and preserved intact by us. On their inviolability the duration of this Students' Guild is made to depend. Still, we en join, further, the following immutable laws : \u2014 \u00a78. Each member of our society who wilfully infringes these sta tutes, as well as every member who, openly or secretly, seeks to change or reject but one single paragraph of them, is to be looked"], [243, "STUDENT LIFE AT JENA. 227 upon as an enemy to the Guild, and to be excluded from it for ever. \u00a79 If, too \u2014 as we can hardly anticipate \u2014 it should ever come to pass that the majority of the members should vote for the aboli tion or alteration of these laws, then the faithful minority alone is entitled to continue in operation as the Student Guild of the Ar minians, and to them, and them only, shall remain the name, the colours, the motto, and the property of the said society. After the novice has read, and given his assent to, the principles and laws above quoted, he is allowed to become a member of the society ; though even then he is not permitted to take part in its formal proceedings, but is regarded as one in a state of probation, whom the Boys have still the right of refusing admission into their circle ; provided, as we said before, they should consider either his habits, or bis sentiments, or even his manners, uncongenial to them. While in this state of probation, the young student is denominated a \"Fox,\" and handed over to the care of the \"Fox Major,\" who is duly elected for the purpose, to be initiated and trained in the \"art and mystery \" of the drinking customs of the Burschenschaft; and it will be seen hereafter, when the reader comes to study the beer-usages of Jena (and some such beer- usages, we should add, prevail, more or less, in every German university), that the prin cipal education of the so-called \"Foxes\" consists in their being bound to drink out of a full glass sex pleno), and to drink to the end of it, too, whenever called upon by a \"Boy\" to do so; and, moreover, that the \"Fox Major\" is at liberty to command the united \" Foxes \" at each of the drinking-bouts, which take place twice or thrice in the week, to swallow after him as much beer as he may be able to toss off at one draught, and to do the same as often as he pleases in the course of the evening. These Foxes almost invariably join the society at the com mencement of a \" semester \", (or half-year), and the occasion upon which they are admitted into the Burschenschaft is called the Eintritts-kneipe (literally \"the entrance drinking-bout\"). In the month of June the \" Stif tungs-commerce\" (or foundation festivity) is held, and at this feast the ceremony of the baptism of each of the newly-inducted members takes place, and the Fox re ceives the nickname that he is ever after to be known by at the University."], [244, "228 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Of the doings on these evenings the following picture, copied from a Jena print, will give the reader a far more graphic idea than any words of ours: \u2014 Baptism of a \"Fox\" at Jena. The Abbot, who is the officiating minister on such occasions, forms part of the beer State-officers in connection with the student-clubs of Jena, and is elected anuually for the office. The reader sees him in the engraving duly got up in his canoni cals (for the Jena students love masquerading as dearly as boys in general delight in costuming), and in the act of pouriug a can ftil of beer on the head of the new member \u2014 as the fitting unction with which to anoint the novice who is to be taught to regard it ever after in the light of \"holy water.\" At these Stifftungs-commerqen (foundation festivities) there en sues another comic ceremony, which is known by the name of the"], [245, "STUDENT LIFE AT JENA. 229 \"Fox-riding\" ( Fuchs-ritt ). What may be the meaning of the sport we are at a loss to divine, though we imagine it is supposed to represent a rude attempt at a fox-hunt; but as the Foxes them selves are the riders rather than the creatures ridden after, it is difficult to see either the sense or the fun of it. However, the boys themselves enjoy it ; for, with the fine spirits of youth, it wants but a straw or a feather to tickle lads into laughter. The subjoined picture is a sac-simile of a lithograph published in the university town, and is quite sufficient to give the reader a uotiou of what takes place on such occasions : \u2014 FOX-RIDING. At the head is seen the \" Fox Major,\" with his huge Frencl hunting-horn across his breast, got up like Gallic huntsmen ii"], [246, "230 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. general, and as utterly unlike an English one as British tars are different from the dandy seamen seen at masquerades ; while the Foxes themselves are shown riding astride the tavern chairs, in which manner the whole body of them go cantering round the room, while the \" Boys \" black the faces of the riders with burnt cork as they go by. On these occasions, too, a special song is sung. The melody of this is exceedingly lively, and by no means disagreeable ; the principal fun of the words consisting in the application of the epithet ledernen (literally leathern, but figuratively simple, stupid) to a number of different and incongruous objects. This adjective we have, in the following translation of the chant rendered by the vernacular phrase of \" shocking bad,\" which appeared to us to be the only equivalent English term that could be used.

The foregoing account of the principles and customs in connec tion with the induction of a novice into the society of the more patriotic of the student-clubs, refers more particularly to the mat ters appertaining to what are technically styled the Burschen schaft institutions of Jena. And we have now to speak of the other student-societies that prevail also at this University. Other student-societies bear the name of \" Corps \" in contra distinction to the Burschenschaft or boy-guilds of the town ; and if the reader will take the trouble to refer to \u00a7 3 of the laws before given in connection with the club called the Arminians or Armins, he will readily understand the utter difference of principle between the boy-guilds and the societies termed the corps, of which we are now about to speak. In the declaration of the Armins the following words occur : \u2014 \" We declare that we will never acknowledge, but rather combat by all means in our power, every society that is opposed to the aim and object of the boy-guilds \u2014 especially the so-called \" hus-"], [248, "232 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. bandmen' and 'corps,' who are a type of a base life among stu- and animated by no sense of patriotism whatever.\" Of thew Jena corps we profess to know nothing but what we heard from the Arminkos themselves ; and they all spake of them as youths who gave up the prime of their life to all manner of debauchery, and described the societies to us as being mere con- vivial unions, with no idea but that of drinking and singing to bring them and bind them together. It is, too, the diametrically- opposite feelings existing between the two antagonistic institutions of the Burschenschaft (boy-guilds) and the Corps-burschen (student corps) which lead to the continual feuds, resulting in the duels that are almost daily occurrences in the suburbs of Jena. So far as we could learn, the youths belonging to the boy- guilds are mostly the sons of Lutheran ministers, or of small tradesmen, or well-to-do peasant proprietors, whereas those in connection with the corps generally belong to a higher class ; and the consequence is, that the aristocratic element of the one body is wholly at variance, and ever at war, with the democratic or patriotic principles of the other. Moreover, the expenses of each member in connection with any one of the student corps are considerably greater than those appertaining to the boy-guilds ; indeed, we were assured that the sum levied by the corps out of the receipts of each student belonging to them amounted to as much as 60 thalers, or \u00a39, for the first half-year out of the money they were allowed by their parents. Further, the members of the corps are sworn, in no way, to chaste or pure lives ; and from what we could glean from the students belonging to the boy- guilds, this, as well as the unpatriotic character of their senti- ments, was the main cause of the hatred existing between the two different institutions. There are three distinct societies comprised under the general head of the Jena corps. These are the Franks, the Westphalians, and tbe Thuringians ; and each of them have their distinctive colours displayed in their caps, their bands, and their Bier-zipfel (beer lappets), as well as in their monogrammatic device \u2014 in the same manner as the members of the boy-guilds before described. The colours of the Franks or Franconians, for instance, are green, red, and gold, green being the distinctive hue, and the others merely the accessories, worn in the form of stripes. Their motto is \u2014 \"Long live the Circle of the Brothers of Franconia!\""], [249, "233 STUDENT LIFE AT JENA. while the device, embroidered in gold-thread upon the crown of their cerevis caps and banner, is as follows : \u2014 The Thuringians. on the other hand, have black for their principal colour, with white and red as accessories, their motto being \u2014 \" Long live: the Circle or the Brothers or Thuringia ! the monogram of which is this :\u2014 Finally, the Westphalians are distinguished, like the Franks, by green as their principal colour, but contradistinguished from them, at the same time, by having black and white for accessory hues, rather than red and gold. The motto of this corps is \u2014 \" Long live the Circle of the Brothers of Westphalia !\" whilst the subjoined device, composed of each of the initial let ters of the motto constitutes their monogram."], [250, "234 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. About one half of the entire students may be said to be mem bers of one or other of the three Jena corps, or else of the three boy-guilds of the town. So far as we could ascertain, the propor tion was as follows ; \u2014 Belonging to each of the Burschenschaft institutions, there are, upon an average, some thirty odd members, or about a hundred in all, which is upwards of one-fifth of the entire collegians. On the other hand, the number of students connected with each of the more aristocratic corps may be taken at twenty : so that one-seventh of the university students are attached to them. Besides these there are the \" husbandmen\" (Oekonoms) studying at the college, who are admitted without any previous examination, and of whom there are about eighty altoge ther at Jena. The remainder of the boys at the university are lads without either democratic or aristocratic principles to maintain \u2014 who are neither wedded to chaste lives, nor, on the contrary, delighting in depraved ones ; and who are classed together by the rest of the students under the opprobrious name of Finks (the literal mean ing of the word being finch, which is described in the dictionaries as a small singing-bird) ; and who, so far as we are able to judge, after a three weeks' stay in the university town, were harmless youths who had come there to study, and were the sons mostly of people who could ill afford the expenses of the hard-drinking customary in the several student-societies. These Finks, or Finches (who are almost the type of our Sizars) wore always a black cap, without any accessory stripes, as a distinctive mark of their non-adhesion to any particular club ; and if our memory serves us, the}- were deficient also in the breast-band and the beer-lappet that the other Jena boys delight to carry. We were at some pains to ascertain what was the average ex pense of the university education in Jena. This, of course, va ries with the habits and customs of the youths coming thither to study ; and so far as we could learn, the following are the best particulars upon this head ; \u2014 To the poor scholars belonging to no society whatever, the cost may be set down at 120\u2014150 thalers (or \u00a318\u2014 \u00a322 10s. of our money) per annum. Those, on the other hand, who are mem bers of one or other of the Jena corps, spend upon an average from 400 to 600 thalers (or from \u00a360 to \u00a390) the year, whilst the expenses of the Burschenschaft lads usually come to between 300 aud 400 thalers (or from \u00a345 to \u00a360) annually. One American"], [251, "235 STUDENT LIFE AT JENA. youth, whose acquaintance we made in the town, told us that the cost of his attendance at the university amounted to 60 thalers (or \u00a39) a month, which is at the rate of upwards of \u00a3100 the year; but then, it should be remembered that his lodgings were more expensive than those of the generality of students, and, may be, he would not put up with tbe fare that Germans are willing to submit to. However, we were assured that the average might be fairly struck at 300 thalers (or \u00a345) per annum. The usual custom is for the students to take their meals at some tavern or hotel in the city, the cost of which is generally about 5 thalers (or 15s.) a month, i. e. 4s. 9c/. the week. Of the style of living we shall have to speak hereafter. The expenses of attending the different lectures are 6 thalers (18s.) each course, every half-year, for those who are studying either theology or jurisprudence, and 30 thalers the course (\u00a34 10s.) for those who desire to be instructed in chemistry or medicine ; so that if we assume that the lodging of a Jena stu- dent costs 2 \\ thalers the month, or say \u00a34 10s. the year, and that his living amounts to 5 thalers a month, or say \u00a310 the year, while the cost of attending the several courses of lectures comes, on the average, to 20 thalers the half-year, or \u00a36 annually, we have the gross yearly expense of the students fairly estimated at 130 thalers, or \u00a319 10s. per annum. Hence, we can readily understand how many of the Finks or Finches who have \" sti- pends,\" as they are called, from the college funds, can manage to get a university education for \u00a320 the year ; and, moreover, what must be the amount of money wasted in beer among the other students, when the bare necessary outlay is \u00a319 10s. per annum, and the customary annual expenditure as much as \u00a345 or \u00a360. One of the Armin Boys furnished us with the following esti- mate of his own expenses for each Semester ; his lodging cost him 17 thalers (\u00a32 Ils.), his dinners 30 thalers (or \u00a34 10s.), his college 20 thalers (\u00a33), his club 40 thalers (\u00a36), his beer and suppers 60 thalers (\u00a39), and his extra expenses 20 thalers (\u00a33), which, added together, gives a sum total of 187 thalers (or \u00a328 Is.) as the cost of each six-months' term at Jena ; and this is at the rate of \u00a356 odd per annum, without either clothes or washing. We were assured, however, that, as a rule, \u00a360 per annum may be taken as the fair average expense of those \" Boys\" whose fathers are well to do, and \u00a315 \u2014 \u00a320 the cost of the poorer scholars, who are in receipt of some \" stipendium \" from the college."], [252, "THE DRINKING AND FIGHTING INSIGNIA OF THE JENA STUDENT CHAPTER XXII OF THE BEER-DRINKING CUSTOMS AT JENA. In Jena, beer alone is the main drink among the youths at the University. In France, wine generally prevails upon such occa sions ; and we must remember that history tells us that Charle magne was the first to introduce the growth of the grape into Germany, prior to which time the Germans had been accustomed solely to the drinking of malt liquors ; and we know, moreover, from the tables of Alexander Humboldt. that even now, it is principally in the Rhenish district that \" potable \" wine can be produced. In all other parts of the Fatherland, beer is still the customary drink of the nation ; and there is not the least doubt that, in our own land, this same malt liquor was the original beverage of our British forefathers. True that, among the Welsh a certain fermented compound of honey and malt liquor called \" mead,\" or \" metheglin \" was indulged in at special festivities ; still beer, throughout the countries incapable of producing wine, was, and is yet, the general beverage of the folk. This word beer, like bread and water, and such other primitive terms, is what the Germans call a \" strong word,\" and its deri-"], [253, "OF THE BEER-DRINKING CUSTOMS AT JENA. 237 vation can be carried no farther back than the Celtic languages \u2014 \u25a0 the Romans and the Greeks having no cognate expression for it. In Welsh it is written bir, and in Amoric, byer aud ber. We are of opinion, however, that this term is the same as the Anglo- Saxon here, signifying barley, and the Hebrew bar, corn, and that \u25a0the word originally meant nothing more than corn-wine ; even as the Germans, to the present day, call the ordinary fermented liquor of the country Eorn-branntwein, and by stenoepy, Eora alone. The beer of Germany remains to this clay of an exceedingly light character : so much so, iudeed, that it is impossible to pre serve the brewings of each town even to the end of the twelve month. In Eisenach, it invariably happens, that the city brewage is drunk out before the end of the summer, and that then \" strange \" beers have to be brought into the city, to slake the thirst of the inhabitants. Indeed, the German beers are, generally speaking, of so delicate or weak a character, that they will not keep the twelvemonth through, even in the coolest cellars, and that four and-tweuty hours after a cask is tapped, the remainder is utterly undrinkable. So that when an Englishman tells the German folk he has drunk (as we have in the late Duke of Devonshire's cellars) beer, at least a hundred years old, and that it is the cus tom of our noblemen to brew, immediately an heir is born, so many barrels that are to be partaken of on the son's attaining his majority, they shrug their shoulders in incredulity, for they cannot understand how it is possible for a stronger decoction than their own to be kept a longer space of time. The greater part of the German beers, indeed, approximate in character to what we call \" table-ale,\" or \" intermediate,\" as such kind of dilute malt liquor used, some time ago, to be styled. They are by no means unpleasant, and, so far as our experience goes, they contribute, when taken in moderation, to an improved action of the vital functions. Indeed, in America, where the naturalized Germans have begun to brew such beers for the enjoyment of their own countrymen, on the other side of the Atlantic, they are often prescribed by the physicians, as the best of medicine for those who are in a weakly condition. That they are by no means so heady as our ales, the English reader can well understand, after having been assured, that it is not unusual for a youth of not-yet-twenty years of age to drink some thirty pint glasses in the course of an evening. Generally, each city has its own peculiar beer, which bears the name of the place where it is"], [254, "238 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. brewed. Such beers are mostly called by the general term Lager- bier, or. literally, beer that can be kept in store. The Jena beer, however, is of a very peculiar kind, and brewed only at the little village of Lichtenhain, which immediately ad- joins the University town. This Lichtenhainer, as it is called, is a species of white beer, or, rather, a decoction made from wheat, instead of barley, and is more the colour of champagne than ordi- nary malt liquor. The flavour of it is far from pleasant at first, for it tastes not unlike the smallest English small-beer, that has turned slightly sour, and gone somewhat flat. Indeed, the only thing to which we can compare it, is a mixture of cider and water, with a dash of camomile-tea added to it. The students, however, assure you, that the taste for it is a growing one, and ultimately becomes so strong, that persons who are accustomed to drink Lichtenhainer, prefer it to beer of any other kind. We are in- clined to believe, however, that this is very much on a par with the eulogies of the Germans respecting their black bread ; for as your true Deutscher always eats white bread when he can get it gratuitously, so do the Jena students, when any grand feast is given, generally prefer to drink the more expensive Lager-beer of the country. On ordinary occasions, however, Lichtenhainer is assuredly the usual drink of the Jena students; and the reason of this is, we are of opinion, because quantity is desired rather than quality ; for the Lichtenhainer beer is of so exceedingly mild a character as to admit of some score or more of pints of it being swallowed at one sitting, with scarcely any intoxicating effect. Moreover, price, we think, is one of the main elements in the consideration, since the ordinary Lager-beer of the country costs from a penny to three-halfpence the pint, and the same quantity of Lichtenhaiuer can be had for three farthings. Lichtenhainer is usually drunk, not out of glasses, as the Lager- beer is, but out of white woodeu cans, or \" stoops ; \" and the cause of this strange custom, you are told, is that the pale and uninviting muddy look of the stuff would not be particularly pleasant to contemplate. These w-ooden cans are coated with resin inside, and are not unlike miniature English chums, fitted with a wooden handle at the side. Every student possesses one of these, and indeed such a beer-can forms as much an indispen- sable part of the Saxon academic paraphernalia, as does a por celain pipe, with the arms of the club to which the student belongs, emblazoned on the bowl, or an ivory-handled cane, or indeed the little gold-embroidered mullin-cap carried by the members of"], [255, "239 OF THE BEER-DRINKING CUSTOMS AT JENA. every German University. This wooden beer-can is always kept in readiness at the tavern, where the club, of which the student is a member, is in the habit of holding its meetings ; and in the passages of the University beer-houses, hundreds of them are to be seen, early in the morning, stuck upon the projecting prongs of huge perpendicular stands that are hke hat-trees, while the cans themselves seem to be the big blossoms at the end of each of the branches. Such a beer-can is always presented to the student by some friend, immediately after his coming to the University ; and on the wooden hd the nickname of the donor, as well as of the donee (for sobriquets are an invariable custom among the Jena boys), is printed in red sealing-wax ; while in the middle appear the letters s / m. 1. standing for \" seinem lieben\" \u2014 that is to say, to his beloved So-and-so \u2014 after the following fashion. \u2014 the sub joined being the inscription upon such a can presented to our son by one of his Jena friends : \u2014 Further, on the front of the can is cut the word \"Jena,\" with the date annexed, and the letters filled up with red sealing-wax as before ; whilst inside the lid there is always engraven the following curious device : \u2014 ill. What on earth this meant we could not, for the life of us, at first conceive ; and what made the matter still more puzzling was, that you would be sure to see, go into whatever beer-house you might, this same Section Eleven painted conspicuously on"], [256, "240 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the rafter in the middle of the ceiling ; or else, maybe, upon the protuberant stomach of some plaster image of Lablache in the character of Figaro. What did this all-important section refer to ? Was it to form the principal point in the loug-looked-for Magna Charta of United Germany, that it was found thus in scribed on the tavern walls and under the lid of every tankard, so that every German might have it continually before his eyes even in his merry-makings? Nor was it till we came into the possession of the book of beer-customs, published for the guide of the Jena students, that the mystery was thoroughly cleared up to our mind. Now, this book of beer-customs is designed, as the title-page tells us, \"for the use and profit of academic conviviality\" (Zu Nutz und Frommen akademischer Gemiithlichkeit entworfen), and is formally issued under the authority of the commissioners ap pointed for the revision of the beer laws (Die zur Revision des Biercomments uiedergesetzte Commission). In the preface, too, we are informed that the \"commission\" determined to perfect its labours, in order to supply a common and deep-felt want; and we are assured that the \" commissioners can, with propriety, take upon themselves to say that they are, at least, no novices in the noble art of barley -juice drinking\" (in der Kunst dem edlen Gerstensaft). The matter of the book itself is pompously divided, with all the pedantry of the German school-men, into \"general\" and \" special\" parts; and these again respe jtively sub-divided into chapters and sections, each headed with a capital or small letter, or with a Roman or Arabic numeral, till the whole classificatory machinery of I., II. , III., 1, 2, 3, and A, B, C, a, b, c, as well as \u00a7 and 1T is utterly exhausted ; while, under such heads, the rules are given concerning the rights and duties of beer-obliga tions, or the loss of beer-honours, or the forms necessary in drinking-to, or drinking in-respouse-to, or the power of bidding a person to drink out of a full glass, as well as of beer-duels and beer-impotence. Moreover, every separate -jaragraph of the book is duly marked \u00a7 1, or \u00a7 2, up to \u00a7 118, as though it were an elaborate scientific treatise ; and it is by reference to \u00a7 1 1 of this highly-ceremonious handbook of beer-etiquette, or most systematic code of beer-laws, that we are enabled to discover the significance of the mysterious symbols inscribed under the lid of every beer-can, and painted on the ceiling of nearly every beer house. For there it stands : \u2014"], [257, "241 OF THE BEER-r.-.!NEING CUSTOMS AT JENA. \u00a711. It is (the duty of all) to swill on. We should not, however, in all justice, omit to mention that there is a small section of students known by the name of \" Wingolfianas\" (a society founded by the German poet Klop stock) who are utterly opposed to such principles, and who are sworn not only against beer-drinking, but also against duelling. Nevertheless, this small knot of youths are as eccentric in their principles, and bear about the same proportion to the majority, as the believers in Johanna Southcote hold to the members of the Established Church in our country ; and they are held in such utter scorn and detestation by the rest of the students, that we were assured by the Jena boys that they never met one of them but they made a point of insulting him, and occasionally beating him in the worst way they could. This extraordinary little tribe of Wingolfianas flourishes chiefly at the University of Halle, an institution which holds no high academic rank in Deutschland ; so that the reader will readily understand that beer-drinking among German students is the common rule, and abstinence from such habits the singular and small exception. With this introduction, we will now proceed to set before the reader as concise an account as possible, of the beer-customs pre valent among the Jena boys ; and those of Jena may be taken as the type of the habits of the students at all other similar institu tions throughout Germany. We should premise, however, that in the abstract here given we follow neither tbe order nor the arrangement of the text-book from which we quote ; since it is necessary for the due comprehension of the several matters by the English reader, that those affairs which the Jena boys under stand almost without any tuition, should be put together, so that such as have less technical knowledge in the art and mystery of beer-drinking may be led gradually from one point to another. The cunning reader, however, will not fail to detect the sly humour that runs throughout the original work. Object and Stability of the Beer-customs. The Jena Beer-customs \u2014 begins \" The New Jena Beer-Com ment,\" published in 1858 \u2014 are particular rights which, when in corporated into a digest of positive laws, could be placed beside 16"], [258, "242 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. any new systems of jurisprudence ; as, for example, the Code of Napoleon, or the Prussian Land Rights. The purpose of the incorporation of the beer-customs is to establish the beer-rights of the Jena boys, to lay down positive rules and laws for all things connected with beer, and upon the breach of such rules to determine the general punishments, as well as those which, in every concrete case, the offender is to suffer. Every Jena student must acknowledge these beer-customs, and in case of refusal a perpetual beer-excommunication hangs over him, without mercy. The same rules hold good hi every place where Jena boys are assembled at drinking-bouts, with the exception of a few beer villages, in which a peculiar custom has arisen, as well as on the hills surrounding Jena, where the noble mountain-customs (Burg brauch) take the place of the ordinary beer-usages with perfect lawfulness. Sources of the Beer-customs. The sources of the beer-customs are mostly old deeds of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries ; nor have the usages which Tacitus records concerning the customs among the ancient Germans at the drinking of the noble barley-juice been in any way disregarded. Of the Regulation of Time in Connection with the Beer-rights. Of the Beer-minutes. \u2014 The leading principle with regard to the regulation of time in connection with beer-business is the duration of the five beer-minutes. The five beer-minutes are generally reckoned as three civil minutes ; but as it would not be agreeable to make use of Philister watches at drinking-bouts and the like, and as it might happen in many cases that none of the beer-honoraries carried a chronometer about with him, so should it generally be left to two beer-honourable boys to decide at beer-convents and other assemblies, whether the five minutes have elapsed or not. Of the Tempus Utile, or Well-occupied Time. \u2014 The tempus utile is every space of time during which a person is kept from fulfilling his beer-obligations by some important business. The expiration of the five beer-minutes, which are generally"], [259, "OF THE BEER-DRINKING CUSTOMS AT JENA. 243 calculated by natural computation, can only be interrupted by the following tempora utilia: \u2014 The time in which any one is sitting as a beer-judge in a beer-convent (or beer-court). The time in which any one is giving his evidence as accuser, witness, or accused in such a beer-convent. The time in which a song given out by the President is be- ing sung at the drinking-bout, or while the Hospitium, ot tavern song, is being chanted by another ; and principally the whole time during which Silentium reigns. The time that any one requires for making expectorations of all kinds. Of the Rights of Persons. Every person admits of beiug divided into physical and juri dical. A physical person is every Jena student who can be regarded as being subject to the beer-rights. Persons physical fall, according to the student's age, under the head of either \"Boys,\" or \"Foxes.\" Only the \"Boys\" are pro perly lawful ; and these are sub-divided into \" Young Boys,\" \"Old Boys,\" and \"Moss-covered Heads\" (bemooste Hdupter). A Young Boy is one between his third and fourth semester (half year). Every student is so regarded from the beginning of his third half-year to the commencement of his fourth. After this, he becomes au \"Old Boy;\" and finally, at the beginning of his sixth semester he rises to the reverence of a \" Moss-covered Head.\" The Foxes are divided into \"Raw Foxes\" fcrasse Fuchse) and \"Branded Foxes\" ( Brands itchse) , according as they are remaining in Jena for their first or second semester of study. A juridical person is, according to generally-received notions, every ideal personage who, with the exception of beer-honourable students, can be considered as a subject of the beer-rights, and is acknowledged by the State. Of Beer-illness. According to another principle of division, we arrange (as many great authorities have done before us) the persons physical into beer-drinkers aud beer-invalids, or those on the beer sick-list. If anybody should be prevented by illness, such as a cold or"], [260, "244 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. other bodily ailment, from strictly following the injunctions of the beer-customs, he must have himself announced as being on the beer sick-list by the President (Prdsis); or, where none exists, by a beer-honourable boy \u2014 that is to say, by one who is not under beer-excommunication. The announcement is made as follows: \u2014 \"Silentium! Muller is beer-sick, or beer-impotent.\" The in valid thus loses the right to drink (so long as the company lasts) either to or in response-to any one, and, above all, to mix himself up in beer-duels. Moreover, a beer-invalid must not bid another, in a state of beer-robustness, to drink out of a full glass, \" expleno,\" as it is called. Of specially-privileged Persons, Of the President. \u2014 The Prasis, or President, is that boy who has to keep peace and order ; and so that he may the better ob tain this end, he has certain rights which take precedence of those of the other boys. The President has a right to bid any one, pro p\u0153nd (by way of punishment), for disturbing the order, or breaking the ordained silence, or committing any other impropriety, to drink up to a \"pope\" (an entire measure full of what the offender may be drinking at the time). If the culprit does not drink after the third summons \u2014 which is just the same as that when a person is bidden to drink out of a full glass \u2014 then the President can put him in beer-excommunication. Further, the President has the right, after every song (provided he be \"recommended,\" as it is termed, to do 60), to call upon a certain person to drink a given quantity, either because he has sung badly, or because he did not sing at all, or because he dis turbed the singing, or for other valid reasons. If the offender does not drink after the third summons, he has the beer-ban put upon him. The President, moreover, on the evenings of the drinking-bouts I ' Eneip-abend) generally permits three songs to be sung ; and be tween the second and third he calls on any student that he pleases, to sing the Hospitium (the tavern-song) ; but he can alter the order of the songs according to his discretion, if there are good grounds for his so doing. At \"commerces'' (or those drinking-bouts in which the members of the other student-clubs are invited to take part) there are, as a rule, three solemn songs sung, and at the end of these the Landesvater (or Fatherland song) is chanted."], [261, "OF THE BEER-DRINKING CUSTOMS AT JENA. 245 The tavem-song, or Hospitium, is demanded after the follow ing manner. When the introductory song has been sung and the President has given out another, he challenges any person he pleases to sing, by saying to him, \" Yivat Muller ! \" If Miillcr, however, does not sing, then excommunication is chanted to him ; whilst, if he commences a song that has already been heard, he is warned by the \" One, two, three! \" of the President ; and if he does not then sing a proper song by the time that the third warn ing is given, excommunication is likewise chanted ; as indeed is also done if he commences singing three songs, one after the other, which have already formed part of the evening's entertain ment. When a Hospitium is sung, every beer-honourable boy must sing in chorus ; and it can, on no account, be permitted that any one drinks at such times in silence, or indulges in the more solemn songs sung at the time of \"Commerce-meetings.\" The President, moreover, has not only the right to determine when a song or Hospiz shall be sung, but it is for him to say, when \"a Salamander shall be rubbed\" (at which times, the beer cans before drinking are rubbed round and round upon the table, as though the united company were grinding colours). If another boy wishes to have a Salamander rubbed, he must pray for Silen tium, which, as a rule, the President has no right to refuse. The theory of the Salamander cannot be given in these beer customs. Of the Fox-Major. \u2014 The Fox-Major (or eldest of the Foxes) has, on the evenings of drinking-bouts, various rights over his brother Foxes. He may order the assembled Foxes each to drink any quantity he pleases to him ; but he must drink, in-response to them, the same as each has previously drunk. Of the Rights of Things. Beer-things may be divided into principal things (or customary articles), subordinate things (or uncustomary articles), and appur tenances. The principal things are \" Lager-beer,\" \" black Costritzer beer,\" \"Lichtenhainer-beer,\" and all other white beers. He only who drinks the principal things can become \"beer-honour able;\" but should the beer honourable boy declare himself to be beer-impotent, there is no necessity for him then to partake of them."], [262, "246 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Secondary things are those drinks like sugar-water, lemonade, coffee, or such other watery messes, which have sprung out of the over-nice taste of the present time. Appurtenances are cans, \"doctors\" (measures so called), \"popes\" (ditto), \"beer-planes\" (the students' term for the clouts with which the tables are rubbed down), chalk (with which the beer-scores and beer-penalties are inscribed), slates (on which the names of those put into beer-excommunications are written), tables, chairs, benches, and other things of that sort. Property, in the meaning of the beer-customs, can only come out of the possession of the principal things ; and the best way of becoming possessed of them is to order the waiter to bring them forthwith. Injuring, or destroying property, is punished by beer-excom munication. Therefore, whoever throws beer over another, has the beer-ban put upon him, unless he uses immediately after wards the words \" without throwing away beer,\" in which case he is penalty-free. Also, whoever, on purpose or by accident, makes away with his property, or, to speak technically, spills beer, and does not say, immediately afterwards, \"without wasting beer,\" has likewise the beer-ban put upon him. Of the Rights arising from Obligations An obligation, according to the Roman laws, could ensue as well from an undertaking to perform a certain thing as from a dereliction or failure in the performance of it. Nevertheless, according to the beer-customs, all derelictions can be punished with beer-excommunication, and from this the duty of purifica tion by the beer-ordeal-by-battle arises, as the chief consequence ; for it is difficult to discover, what the vari\u0153 causarum figur\u0153 of the old Romans have to do with the beer-customs of Jena, and, therefore, beer-rightly considered, an undertaking can be the only ground of an obligation. An undertaking or contract consists in the union of two beer honourable boys towards one common voluntary object, entered into with solemn forms, through which the beer-righteous posi tion of the contractors to one another is, in the concrete, brought more closely together. Particular acts of agreement are the contracts of drinking-to and drinking-in-r\u00absponse-to \u2014 the beer youngsters' contract \u2014 and finally the beer-duel contracts."], [263, "OF THE BEER-DRINKING CUSTOMS AT JENA. 247 Of Drinking-to and Drinking-in-response-to. \u2014 If any one wishes to drink-to any one, he must give evidence of such a desire by the words \" Muller, something is lifted up (in honour) to thee\" (\"Es steigt dir etwas\"), or, \" I advance with something to thee\" (\" Ich komme dir was\"), or in the like manner. Simple nodding or whistling does not suffice for this purpose. After the person drunk-to signifies his acceptance of the drinking-ro him by the words, \"Drink, bless thee\" (\"Prosit\"), or, \"It is good!\" the first takes away any quantity he pleases, but, at the least, one \"cow-gulp \" (Euh-schluck). If the drinker- to drinks before the one drunk-to has accepted the pledge, the latter need not drink in-response-to the former. If anybody wishes to drink a definite \" quantum\" to another, he must always mention the quantum in his proposal, saying, for instance, \" Muller, a half-measure (called a Doctor) is lifted up to thee,\" or, \" I advance to thee with a whole pope.\" More than one \" pope\" at a time need not be accepted, unless the double quantity is \" clapped-on\" (ubergestiirzt), or unless there is a desire to \" spring in the air,\" as it is termed (in die Lust zu sptrengen), that is to say, when a number of boys unite together to drink a certain quantum, collectively, to another ; whereupon, each of the party drinks such a quantity as he likes, but so that the sum of the quantities drunk by the whole number makes up one \" pope\" or more. In such a case the proposal must be accepted up to three popes or six doctors of Lichtenhainer ; but these need not be drunk all at once by the person responding, but only at every other five beer -minutes. The desire to \" spring in the air\" is announced, generally, in the following terms: \u2014 \"Muller! Schulze and I would spring in the air with thee to the extent of two popes.\" Everybody is bound, after the third challenging, to accept the proposal to drink any quantity, in conformity with the beer customs, which he may be challenged to take ; and in case of his refusal, the beer-ban may be put upon him. But the acceptance to drink does not alone suffice ; for the one drunk-to is bound also, on pain of excommunication, to drink off, in response, the same quantity as he has accepted, and to do that after the third \" step \" (Tritt), or challenge to fulfil his beer-duties \u2014 which, however, cau only occur at the expiration of five beer-minutes. A step, or Tritt, is announced in the following words : \u2014 \" Mullet is, for the first time, demanded to follow me with a half,\" or as the case may be. A Fox, on pain of beer-excommunication, may not take \" such a step \" towards a beer-honourable boy."], [264, "248 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. The act of drinking in response is made known by the follow- ing words : \u2014 \" Schulze, I follow thee ! \" or in hke manner ; and when Schulze simply says, \" Drink, bless thee !\" then Muller 'or the one drinking in-response-to the other), drinks merely alone. But if Schulze (or the one who has before drunk to him), replies, \" Drink, bless thee\u2014 in the world ;\" or if, while drinking to Muller, Schulze had, at first, added these most significant words, \" in the world\" which, nevertheless, stand only for some- thing less than a whole quantum), then the person drinking in- response-to the other is at liberty to drink-to a third party with the quantum he has to take. But he is bound, nevertheless, to allow this third person, in his turn, to drink, \"in the world,\" with another person, too. More than three quantums cannot be going on \" in the world\" at once, nor need anyone accept to drink a quantum twice which he has already drunk \" in the world,\" in-response-to another. To every person proposing to drink a specified quantity to another, double that quantity can be \" clapped on\" (nach gestiirtz) by the person challenged. This after-clapping-on, however, or doubling the quantity that a Boy proposes to drink to another, is forbidden to Foxes, and that on pain of beer-excommunication. Of Bidding to Drink ex pleno. \u2014 The ancient worthy institution of drinking ex pleno, or out of a full glass, was introduced, many \" gray years \" ago, by our wise forefathers, and is still the most practical method of restraining, in some measure, the luxurious habits of the Foxes. Every boy can bid every Fox who gives himself wanton or luxurious airs to drink out of a full glass. But as the Foxes generally indulge in legions of luxuries, so they cannot be severally mentioned here ; and it must, therefore, be left to the discretion of every boy to judge concerning each concrete case of a Fox's luxuriousness. The solemn act of bidding a person drink ex pleno is performed in the following manner : \u2014 The bidder challenges the offending Fox three times thus, with the words : \u2014 \" Muller, drink ex pleno for the first time ; Muller, drink ex pleno for the second time; and Muller, drink ex pleno for the third and last time ;\" where upon the bidder takes a sip out of his own glass. Then, if the party challenged does not drink immediately after the last chal lenge is given, the challenger can have him sent to Coventry (bei stecken) there and then, without having to wait for the customary five beer-minutes. Moreover, on no account can any lazy excuses be admitted at such times : such as \"I will first fill my pipe,'' or \" Let me first take a pinch of snuff,\" or any other similar"], [265, "OF THE BEER-DRINKING CUSTOMS AT JENA. 249 phrase ; for if such idle subterfuges are offered, the infliction of the beer-excommunication will follow without mercy. If the cul prit has no liquor in his glass, he must, on pain of being put into beer-excommunication, order a fresh glass to be brought to him. If the drinker breaks off while drinking his full glass, then any one else can challenge him to drink further, in the following manner: \u2014 \" For the first time of breaking off: Muller drink on for the first time ; Muller, drink on for the second time ; Muller, drink on for the third and last time;\" and in the same manner if he breaks off a second or third time. If then he does not drink immediately, or he should break off more than three times while in the act of drinking his full glass, the ex pleno bidder can have him at once put into beer-excommunication. Of Beer-youngsters. \u2014 A beer-youngster is made out in the fol lowing manner. One taunts the other with the words \" Muller, you are a beer-youngster,\" whereupon Muller is bound, on pain of beer-excommunication, to fill his glass within five beer-minutes, and be ready to drink unless he has reasonable excuses to the contrary, such as older suits, or beer-duels. Then the one who has taunted the other calls \" One !'' where- upon the other cries \"Two!\" immediately after which the first party says, \" Three !\" At Three ! both must drink out as quickly as they can, and the one who can first call the other a \" beer- youngster\" has beaten him (ihn angeschissen). Of Beer-duels. \u2014 A beer-duel is brought about in the following way : \u2014 One says to another, \" Muller, thou art learned.\" If the other does not think it worth his while to improve upon this, then must the speaker repeat the preceding words for the first, second, and third time, and afterwards wait for five beer-minutes ; when if the one to whom the words are addressed, does not improve upon them in that time, the ban is put upon him. If, on the other hand, he does think it worth while to improve upon them, he must either challenge the assertion, which he makes known merely by the word \" Challenged !\" or else he must \" clap on\" to them with the phrase \" Schulze, thou art a doctor.\" Schulze, in that case, can either challenge in return or \" clap on \"further, by adding \" Muller, thou ait a pope ;\" and so on, the degrees of \" clapping on \" being as follows : \u2014 A \" learned man\" is equal to half a \" doctor ; \" a \" pope \" to two \" doctors ;\" the \" seraphim\" to four doctors ; \" Christendom\" to eight doctors ; and a \" church yard \" to sixteen doctors. Directly the word \"Challenged!\" has been utt.red, the dis-"], [266, "250 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. pute is at an end, except upon \" thou art learned,\" for he who has grumbled upon (aus gebrummt) those words, need not content himself with merely challenging, but can force the other to a higher challenge by means of the following words, which must be three times audibly spoken : \" Schulze, I revoke on beer fright (Bier-manschetten). Thou art bullying ! \" If Schulze does not then immediately clap on \"learned man,\" to the other (whereupon Muller can, in return, afterwards clap on \"doctor\"), the beer-ban is put upon Schulze. Directly any one has chal lenged upon clapping on, he may on no account recall the challenge in order to have the opportunity of clapping ou to a higher extent, but the affair is then finished without anything else being done. Duels, brought about in such a manner, must be determined in from five to ten beer-minutes according to priority. If any one is too slow, his opponent can, after five beer-minutes, challenge him to fulfil his beer-duties (treten ihn) by saying three times, \" Muller, I am fixed upon the beer-ordeal-by-battle for the first, second, and third time.\" Then, if the other (unless he has some reasonable excuse) does not immediately \"go loose \"(pro ceed to fight-out the matter), the beer-ban is put upon him. But he has a reasonable excuse, provided there is any older beer-duel agaiust him, and in such a case he must bring to a conclusion the other duels in from five to ten beer-minutes. If both the disputants are ready for the decision of the duel, each chooses a second, and he who has clapped on to the highest point selects the equalizer, while the challenger chooses the commander. After the equalizer has been summoned three times by the words, \" Equalizer, make the weapons equal be tween Muller and Schulze, for the first, second, and third time,\" he must do so conscientiously, in five beer-mhiutes ; and in case of his failing in this, the beer-ban is put upon him. Then the commander is summoned, and he must perform his office after the third calling, on pain of beer-excommunication also, by utter ing the words, \" Grasp the doctors, or popes, as the case may be. Clink your glasses ! your lips to the vessels ! drink out ! \" At \" Clink your glasses ! \" both parties to the beer-duel knock on the table, but not against a wooden measure. At \" Your lips to the vessels ! \" they put the weapons to their mouths, and at \" Drink out!\" they proceed to toss off the quantum as quickly as possible, If one proceeds to drink out before the command is given,"], [267, "OF THE BEER-DRINKING CUSTOMS AT JENA. 251 both seconds have the right to cry \" Halt ! \" and in this case the equalizer must again adjust the weapons ; so likewise must the commander again give the command. If, nowever, \" Halt ! \" is not called, the contest proceeds, and both drink on. On no account may the weapons be changed. If both the disputants have drunk out, (which must happen within five beer-minutes for a \" Christendom,\" and within ten beer-minutes for a \"church-yard\" upon pain of beer-excom munication,) then the equalizer, on pain of the same punishment, must give within five beer-minutes his verdict, which must be either that both have drunk in time (a tempo) or that one is defeated (angeschissen). \" Defeated \" is the verdict given against \u2014 Whoever sets his glas on the table later than his opponent. A wooden vessel does not count as a table. Whoever lets it fall or breaks it. Whoever has clinked on the table or not at all, Whoever has left as much beer among the froth in his glass as will nearly cover the bottom. Whoever commences to drink before the command is finished. Whoever \"bleeds\" (that is to say, allows the beer to run out of the corners of his mouth) more than by drops, has the ban put upon him, unless he directly says, \" Without beer-spilling.\" Whoever cheats in any way at a beer-duel, or if the equa- lizer gives his verdict unjustly, or the commander com- mands three times improperly, he has the ban put upon him. Whoever, during a beer-duel, breaks off more than three times, while drinking out a \" pope \" or more, has the ban put upon him. Of the Duties of the \" Foxes, The \" Foxes \" hardly come within the scope of the beer customs. The limits of the laws under which they are bound are as follows : \u2014 Foxes dare never take a \" step\" (selbst treten) or make a demand upon a boy, for the first, second, or third time, i.e. they can never challenge him to fulfil his beer-rightful duties to them or any other ; and every \" step \" or demand of a Fox shall be"], [268, "252 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. reckoned as such, even if the words be added \" Without wishing to make any demand myself\" as a means of keeping off any beer-excommunication that might follow. Foxes cannot sit as beer judges (Bier-richter) in a beer-convent (Bier-convent); but it is allowed (exceptionally) for \"Branded Foxes \" to do so, provided there be not enough beer-honourable boys to form such a convent, and the calling of it does not admit of delay. If a Fox, on this account, sits as beer-judge, the accused can immediately reject the decision of the beer-convent, on account of improper judgment (verhoiresciren) ; and if the special beer-convent notwithstanding declares'itself competent, he can appeal to a general beer-convent against it. A Fox dare never challenge a grumbling boy on the retort termed \"learned,\" but must \"clap on\" to it. Among them- selves, however, Foxes have a right to do so without any difference. On the other hand, if a Fox should challenge a boy on the retort \" learned \" (Sturz gelehrt), he dare not revoke upon \" beer-fright\" (Bier-manchetten), nor make him \" the bully reproach\" (Benoma- gevorwurf). Whoever transgresses these rules has the ban put upon him. A Fox, however, may, on a boy's drinking to him, \" clap on\" (nach-sturzen) the double quantity in-response. A Fox himself can never put any one into beer-excommunica- tion, or call a beer-convent, or fight out (heraus-pauken) any one who has been so excommunicated ; nor can he give the command at such times, but he must let all such business be transacted by a beer-honourable boy. Above all, he may never call \" Silen- tium ! \" at the drinking-bouts, and in case of his doing so the ban may be put upon him. Moreover, the Fox must and shall drink when bidden, out of a full glass, or, in other words, ex pleno. Of Revoking. In general, any transaction in accordance with or in violation of the beer-customs can be made as if it had never happened, by revoking it. Of the Beer-convent or Beer-court. The beer-convent is a law court which every one who feels himself wronged in the matters of beer can call together and lay his complaint before, and to whose infallible verdicts plaintiffs as well as defendants must submit without a murmur."], [269, "of the beer-drinking customs AT JENA. 253 Such wrongs, as a rule, Can occur only when a person is put into beer-excommunication unlawfully ; as hi all other cases, where the person has been excommunicated through his own fault, no appeal is allowed. The beer-convent has two courts of law. The first court is represented through the medium of the special or simple beer-convent. Nevertheless, whoever is not quieted by the verdict of this court, or wishes to denounce the failings of it, as regards certain necessary forms, can appeal to the second court, which constitutes the general beer-convent. Of the Means of Confirming the Beer-lawful Affairs, and especially of the Grand Cerevis. \u2014 As the Greeks and Romans swore to the truth by Zeus or Jupiter, and the gods by the gates of the Infernal Regions, so is the \" Son of the Muses \" to confirm the truth of what he speaks with the words \u2014 \" upon my grand cerevis,\" that is to say, he is to pledge himself upon the beer-cap, or ribbon, which forms the distinctive point in the student's costume \u2014 the word \" cerevis\" being merely a contraction of the Latin cerevisia (beer). As the grand cerevis takes the place of an oath, therefore it must not be used thoughtlessly. Moreover, a positive fact oidy can be certified by the grand cerevis, for a negative one can never be vouched for by it ; as, for instance, it is not admissible to assure another upon one's grand cerevis that such and such a thing did not take place. The grand cerevis, however, can be given as a pledge that the party speaking did not see or hear of such and such an event. If any one is of opinion that another has been so thoughtless as to pledge his grand cerevis falsely, he can have him sent to beer-Coventry ; but if the person thus accused believes himself to be wronged, he is at liberty to call a beer-convent to have the case investigated, and such beer-convent is to inquire into the matter by means of the evidence of two witnesses who are to be appointed by the accuser. No one can give his contra to another's grand cerevis \u2014 that is, no one has the right to say nay to it \u2014 on pain of beer-excom munication. The simple and little cerevis cannot be regarded as of ancient origin, and therefore may be invoked falsely without any immi nent punishment ; though in a moral sense a false assertion on a little cerevis would be just as unpardonable as the breaking of one's grand cerevis. Of the Wit7iesses. \u2014 Although a grand cerevis is an assertion"], [270, "254 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. that admits of no doubt, a highly- wise beer-convent nevertheless takes upon itself to make upon such a point a discreet exception ; and in every case demands to have brought before it two witnesses, who must be beer-honourable people, and who are to deal with the existence or non-existence of the fact to the court, and if pos sible to prove or declare that they never saw or heard anything of the matter in question. Such witnesses are bound to corrobo rate all the facts they state by vows upon their grand cerevis. If they refuse to do this, they have the ban put upon them. Of Special Beer Convents. \u2014 The special beer-convent is com posed of three beer-honourable' boys, and only when needful a \" Branded Fox \" is allowed to figure as the second beer-judge. The first and third judges must be beer-honourable boys, and if possible such as have grown grey in following the beer-customs ; for too much depends upon the responsibility of such an office, to admit of its being allowed to become the play-work of a Fox. The arrangement of a beer-convent occurs in the following manner. The implorer prays some beer-honourable to arrange for him a beer-convent, whereupon the boy says, in an audible voice, \" Silentium ! Muller wishes to arrange a beer-convent against Schulze. A beer-honourable Fox sticks him down (klam mere ilin ein) for the first time of declaring.\" Foxes, beer-impotents, and beer-outcasts cannot themselves call a beer-convent, but must allow this to be done by a beer honourable boy. This happens thus : the selected beer-honour able boy comes to an understanding with the implorer as to the beer-judges ; and the boy is answerable, on pain of beer-excom munication, that neither a Fox, nor beer-invalid, nor a beer outcast sits upon the bench with the others. Then the boy cries out, in an audible voice, \" Silentium ! Muller calls for a beer convent against Schulze, in which Meyer shall sit as first beer judge, Schmidt as the second, and Lehmann as the third.\" Then he says to the first chosen beer-judge, \" Silentium ! the beer convent has to assemble.\" If there are no cases of rejection on account of unfitness brought forward or to be got rid of, in conformity with the beer-customs, then the beer-judges move towards the table, after the first beer judge has said \" Silentium ! the beer-convent is about to assemble;\" and directly the cautio pro expensis (security for the costs), con sisting of three bottles of Lichtenhainer, or three mugs of Lager beer, which the accuser has to furnish, have made their appear ance (but not before), the first judge exclaims, \" Silentium ! the"], [271, "OF THE BEER-DRINKING CUSTOMS AT JENA. 255 beer-convent is formed,\" which is equivalent to declaring that the court is competent to act \u2014 that is to say, it can only be denounced as unfit after that, provided a Fox, a beer-impotent, or beer-out cast has been sitting ou the bench \u2014 and its juridical personality is thereupon immediately effective. After the beer-judges have strengthened themselves (a form, however, the observance of which is not necessary), then the first beer-judge cites the accuser through the words \" Silentium ! the accuser before the beer-con vent, or Accusator citatus,\" whereupon the complainant is to ap pear in proper clothing, and without any head-covering, or pipe or cigar in his mouth. If he does not come forth after the third summons, or will not put away his cap or pipe, the ban is put upon him in contumacium (for contempt of court), and he has to pay the cautio pro expensis ; and then the proceedings are finished. If,- however, the accuser steps forward, he is asked why he summoned the beer-convent ; and thereupon the accused is cited to appear, so that he may hear his exceptions. Then the beer convent demands of that party who has positive deeds to prove, to produce two witnesses. If, however, no witnesses are brought forward, they both lose their cause ; but if, on the other hand, witnesses are in readiness, these are cited to appear before the court and then questioned on their grand cerevis as to the facts ; and generally according to the testimony of the witnesses pro duced is the verdict given. When the respective parties are heard, the beer-judges proceed to vote, the third doing so first ; and the verdict is thus decided by the majority of votes. After this, another refreshment on the part of the beer-judges takes place, and then the verdict is proclaimed by the third judge in the following manner : \u2014 \" Silen tium ! it has pleased a high, well-wise, and always infallible beer convent, to decide that Muller passes into beer-excommunication, and pays the cautio pro expensis. Schulze, on the contrary, comes out of beer-excommunication, and is pronounced free in every way, and that because he had right on his side.'' Or else the verdict is the reverse of this. After this has been announced, and Miiller and Schulze have been respectively chalked in and out upon the beer-slate, -the first judge declares the proceedings at an end with the words, \" Silen tium! the beer-convent is dissolved.\" If interruptions of any kind occur during the session of the beer-convent, each of the beer-judges has the right to warn the peace-breaker, with the words, \"Muller is warned for the first"], [272, "256 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. time,\" <fcc, and to send to beer-Coventry any one who has been thus thrice warned. Of the General Beer-convent. The general beer-convent consists of twelve beer-honourable boys, and any three of the Jena corps-boys. The proceedings and other matters connected with such a court are analogous to those of a special beer-convent, so that only the foUowing points are worthy of remark. The special beer-convent, which is accused before the general one, has to choose from among its members a deputy, whose duty it is to defend it before the general court. The oldest member of the different corps presiding takes the precedence at the general beer-convent, conducts the proceedings, and publishes the verdict. A special beer-convent cannot, as a. persona sacro saneta (ahigh holy person), be put into beer-excommunication, but can only be condemned to pay the caution expenses of the general, as well as of the special beer-convents ; and the amount of such caution expenses for the general beer-convent, is twelve quarts of lager beer, or twelve cans of Lichtenhainer. Beyond this, the beer-convent for the bad performance of its official duties, can only receive a warning at the utmost. Of Beer-Excommunication. Of the Loss of Beer-honours. \u2014 Persons physical may be further divided into beer-honourables and beer-outcasts. Beer-excommunication changes a beer-honourable boy into a beer-outcast, and involves the loss of all beer-honours, and there with the exclusion from all the rights and duties that belong to a beer-honourable boy. The beer-excommunication holds good only for that drinking bout on which it is imposed. Whoever has the beer-excommuni cation of one or the other grades put upon him suffers the follow ing disadvantages : \u2014 He may not join in the hospitium or tavern-song, nor in the drinking-bout songs, nor can he take part in any \" beer- ulk,\" i.e. (beer-fun.) He may chalk no one down on the beer-slate."], [273, "OF THE BEER DRINKING CUSTOMS AT JENA. 257 He may not mix himself up in any beer-duel. He can never bid any one drink ex pleno. He cannot be a witness before any beer-convent ; nor can he give his cerevis, for such an act is illegal. He may not fight any one out at a beer-duel, nor command thereat. He dare not git at a beer-convent, nor call one. Whoever as beer-outcast fails in any of these things, from the simple, into the acute state of excommunication, or if he has already been in that state, he passes into perpetual beer-excommunication. Every beer-honourable boy, who believes he has proper reasons, can declare another to be in beer-excommunication, and have his name written upon the slate. A Fox, however, must let that be done through a beer-honourable boy. But a beer-outcast cannot, even through a beer-honourable boy, put another in beer-excom munication, on pain of himself passing from the simple into the acute state. The act of declaring any one in beer-excommunication occurs in the following words, which must be spoken in a loud and solemn voice; \u2014 \"Silentium! Muller is in beer excommunication. A beer-honourable Fox chalks him down.\" If, however, no Fox does so immediately, then the speaker must repeat the words twice in an audible voice, and if the name of the culprit is not then within five beer-minutes chalked upon the slate, the whole of the beer-honourable Foxes have the ban put upon them, through the words \" Silentium ! The assembled Foxes are in beer-excom munication. A beer-honourable young boy chalks them down.\" Hereupon it is the duty of the young boys to chalk the Foxes down on the slate within five beer-minutes ; and if this is not done, then they, in their turn, are excommunicated, and so on analogously, up to the \" mossy heads \" \u2014 each on pain of being put under the beer-ban. It is never necessary for him who wishes to put any one in beer-excommunication to chalk the other down himself. Through the beer-excommunication, all pre-challenged duels and quantities to be drunk-to another become null and void. A beer-outcast is by no means bird-free, and nobody dare rub shoulders with him. Beer-excommunication is either simple, acute, or perpetual : and it is hereby to be remarked that no one can enter the acute stage of excommunication, who has not first been in the simple, 17"], [274, "258 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. nor can any one pass into the perpetual, unless he has already been in the acute stage, or unless he refuses to acknowledge the beer-customs. Into the simple stage of beer-excommunication passes \u2014 Whoever calls a beer-honourable a beer-outcast, or treats him as such ; or if, for example, he writes him down on the beer-slate, without being authorized to do so by a beer-honourable boy. Whoever, on the other hand, treats a beer-outcast as a beer- honourable ; as, for example, whoever wipes his name off the slate, or lets it be wiped off before he has fought himself out iheraus-gepaukt). Whoever, in any kind of way, holds beer-communion with a beer-outcast. Whoever gives his cerevis falsely or negativelv. Whoever accuses any one of having given it falsely without instantly having him sent to beer-Coventry. Whoever gives his cerevis against an already given contra. Every Fox who demands of a boy to fulfil his beer-duties to him, or who sits in a beer-convent, or who, at beer-duels, presumes to equalize or command, except upon \" learned man,\" or who challenges upon the retort \" learned \" of a grumbling boy, or who revokes upon \" beer-fright \" to a boy, or gives him the bully-reproach, or when drunk-to \" claps on \" a double quantity in response. Every Fox who, at the third challenge, does not drink ex pleno ; or who, after \" breaking-off,\" while trying to do so, does not drink further, after being ordered three times ; or who, moreover, at ex-pleno-irinkiug, breaks off more than twice. Whoever cheats in any way at ex-pleno drinking. Every one who, after the third summons, does not drink the pro-p\u0153nd quantum dictated by the President. Whoever throws away or wastes beer without, at the same time, making use of the words, \" without beer to waste, or, eventually, to spill.\" Whoever makes an advance to another (vorkommt), and does not drink before five beer-minutes have elapsed. Whoever, after the third summons, does not immediately drink a quantum in conformity with the beer-customs which has been proposed to be drunk-to another. Whoever, after the third bidding (which should only follow"], [275, "OF THE BEER DRINKING CUSTOMS AT JENA. 259 after five beer minutes) does not immediately drink in- response-to another. Whoever allows the taunt of a beer-youngster to remain upon him longer than five beer-minutes. Whoever, at a beer-duel, breaks off more than three times while drinking from a pope to a doctor downwards. Whoever employs the Silentium uselessly, &c. Into the acute state of beer-excommunication passes : \u2014 Whoever, as a beer-outcast, says, in answer to a question put to him, that he is not in beer-excommunication Whoever does not fight out of the simple state of beer-ex- communication within fifteen beer-minutes, or in a still shorter time at the wish of the President, unless he can produce a valid excuse for not doing so. Whoever, as beer-outcast, dabbles in any kind of affair that only belongs to a beer-honourable ; as, for instance, clap- ping-on, challenging, drinking-to, fighting-out, sitting in the beer-convent, bidding drink ex pleno, giving out songs, or calling for the Hospitium, or ordering a Sala- mander to be rubbed, or chalking any one upon or off the slate. Whoever makes himself luxurious as a beer-outcast. When two beer-outcasts behave to one another as a beer- honourable, in order to escape the disagreeable conse- quences of the beer-excoinmunication, then both of them go into the acute state. Whoever, as beer-outcast, has called \" Silentium !\" &c. On the other hand, into the perpetual state of beer-excommu nication passes \u2014 Whoever makes himself luxurious while he is still an acute beer-outcast, or undertakes matters that belong only to a beer-honourable boy. Whoever will not acknowledge the beer-customs, &c. Of the Restitution of the Beer-honours. If any one wishes to demand his beer-honours back again, he must submit to the beer-ordeal by battle, and fight himself out of beer-excommunication with the three doctors of Lichtenhainer, or one pope of lager-beer, if he has been merely in the simple state; and with double that quantity if he is an acute beer outcast ; and with three times as much if a perpetual one. The"], [276, "260 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. act of fighting out of any grade of beer-excommunication must not last longer than five minutes ; if it does so, it is not valid. The beer-outcast, in order to become again beer-honourable, must address himself to some beer-honourable boy with the request that he will help him to fight-out. This one may drink as he pleases, while the beer-outcast must drink out his full glass. The act of fighting-out (heraus-pauken) goes on in the fol lowing manner : the oue desiring to fight the other out chooses a commander, who must be at least a young boy. He commands now, \" Grasp the doctors (or popes) ! Clink your glasses ! Your lips to the vessels ! Drink out !\" and repeats this, when the vessels to be drained are doctors, twice. If the quantum is drunk in five beer-minutes, the one fighting-out declares the beer-outcast to be beer-honourable by the audibly-spoken words, \" Silentium ! Muller is out of beer-excommunication.\" If one minute has elapsed over the appointed time, before the beer-outcast has drunk the proper quantity, he assuredly cannot be annomiced as beer-honourable, but must drink once more in order to become so ; and if the one fighting him out has, of his own free will, let him off anything, this one must go into beer excommunication also. A beer-outcast can never fight-out with beer drawn from a cask of which the whole company, or maybe only a part of it, are drinking \u2014 because, by such means, a kind of beer-communion would ensue. The beer-outcast, therefore, must take care to be supplied with extra stuff by the landlord."], [277, "JENA \"BOTS\" CELEBRATING A \" DOCTOESHIP \" (From a Photograph oy Herr Schen/c, of Jena.) CHAPTER XXIII OF THE DRINKING-BOUTS OF THE JENA STUDENTS. As yet we have said nothing of the town of Jena itself. But a few lines, however, will be sufficient for this purpose, after the picture we have already given the reader as to the wattle-and dab character of the architecture, and tumble-down state of the build ings, as well as the rudely-paved condition and crooked alley-like appearance of the streets in the Thuringian capital. One city in Saxe-Weimar is the same collection of mud hovels as another ; even as, go where you will, each Saxon village is so thoroughly"], [278, "262 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the same cluster of wigwams, that it is impossible to trace the least difference between Mohra and Mosbach, or Lichtenhain and Seigenhain. So that when the traveller has set eyes upon one of the wretched, squalid holes or hamlets, he would save himself no end of annoyance, and a considerable amount of robbery, if he were to avail himself of his \" return-ticket \" and no longer wander on merely to find the same state of social misery prevailing at every five miles' distance of his travels throughout the Grand Duchy. When the stranger has seen Eisenach, he has seen Weimar, and Jena too ; for the same civic abominations belong to the whole. The streets are left in the same wretched state \u2014 there is the same utter want of draining, paving, and water-service throughout the entire towns \u2014 the same defective housing \u2014 the same stupid, antiquated notions of liberty and justice, and the same despotic police-meddling in each and every of them. Indeed, the only city in the neighbourhood which seemed to us but one degree removed from some African settlement, was that of Gotha, where, at least, the houses and the shops had some what more of the air of civilization, comfort, and enterprise about them. But why such a difference should exist between the capitals of principalities that are hardly a day's walk apart, we leave it to others to say. Suffice it for our present purpose to add, that the whole of Saxe-Weimar is a disgrace to any govern ment professing to be a shade more enlightened than that of Russia itself. Still, Jena has certain student peculiarities about it, which are not to be found in the other Saxe-Weimarish towns. One would naturally imagine from its being a celebrated seat of learning, and boasting a \" Senatus Academicus,\" consisting of twenty-eight ordinary professors, and no less than seventeen extraordinary ones, besides a certain number of private tutors, that the town would be distinguished by some fine classic or scientific features \u2014 that it would be a mass of learned halls, libraries, and museums, of philosophical instrument-makers, and Polytechnic Institutions. Such, however, is far from being the case ; for the largest number of the academic establishments are for the refreshment and amusement, rather than the enlightenment of the students, and consist of confectioners' shops, for the dispensation of ices, as well as all kinds of drinks, a long catalogue of which generally appears in the windows, including \" May-wine, cardinal, bishop, sparkling pine-apple punch, grog, and liqueurs.\" Indeed, these"], [279, "DRINKING-BOUTS OF THE JENA STUDENTS. 263 pastry-cook shops swarm in Jena as thick as cash in Paris ; and outside many of them are little round green tables, where the thirsty or heated boys may invigorate themselves after their severe studies. Another marked characteristic of the town is, the number of shops with small bills announcing that \" Soda and Selters-water\" can be had there ; many more, too, have painted on their shutters a list of the salt fish they sell, including every variety of herring, from the \" pickled \" to the \" smoked,\" down to the \" Marinriter\" \u2014 as well as the more expensive luxury of dried salmon, for those whose jaded stomachs of the overnight require to be tickled with some specially-tasty relish in the morning. Further, one of the most striking features of the place is the out-of-door refreshments, in which the students appear to delight, and which give to the town so singular an appearance, for Ger many ; so much so, indeed, that the stranger is apt to believe, as he walks the streets, that he has been carried by mistake to some of the \" banlieux\" outside the gates of Paris : for he finds in the summer-time, the students sitting at mid-day in the open thorough fare, with their coats off, and playing cards at small tables, while they drink their coffee or eat their cherry-cake, in the same care less manner as if they were so many light-hearted French work men. The rest of the shops at Jena seem tojbe one and all given up to the supply of student-luxuries rather than to furnishing the mate rials of learning and science. Even the booksellers' stores have a greater show of lithographs outside their door, depicting the various phases of a student's life, than any ostentatious arrange ment of the classics or philosophic text-books, wherewith to catch the passing customers ; for here are to be seen large prints of every form of duel, from a \" bloody one\" (Ein Bhttiger), in which one of the combatants lies stretched on the ground, while the other is busily wiping his sword \u2014 down to \" Taken by surprise \" (Abgefasst), where you see the beadles rushing in at the door of a small room and the duellists scrambling out of the windows, while a student, who is coolly smoking his pipe, attempts to parley with the officers, who have been sent to apprehend the offenders. Here, too, you behold how the more riotous of the students dance in their shirt-sleeves with the girls of the neighbourhood, at balls known vulgarly as Schwof. Another of such pictures bears the title of \" Night Scandals,\" which in free English would signify night larks or night riots, and"], [280, "264 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. represents the students in the act of removing a sign-board from a candle-maker's shop, while others are engaged in \" bonneting \" and taking the spears from the night watchmen, who have sur prised their friends in the act; for such tricks go on in Jena continually, after the beer-houses are closed. Cigar-shops, pipe-shops, walking-stick shops, there are also without number ; so, too, are there peculiar shops kept by painters upon china, where you see at work behind the shop window the artist himself, who is ready to depict any device or escutcheon upon the porcelain pipe-bowls of the Jena boys \u2014 or, indeed, to emblazon for them any inscription they please upon the earthen ware tablets that they delight to have let in to the tops of their glass Bier-seidels, or even into the sides of their cigar cases. Nor are the cutlers' and saddlers' shops less remarkable for the student-character of the articles exposed in the windows ; for in the former you find, instead of knives and forks, rows of handle less rapier-blades, as long and thin as flattened reeds, and which give you the notion of their being merely elongated lancets ; while below lie the detached globular hand-shields for the same, that are like the basket hilts to single-sticks, but made out of iron wire, and decorated with the bright colours of the various student clubs. On the other hand, not a single saddle, nor hardly a bridle, is to be seen in the harness-makers' shops \u2014 the windows being filled merely with the yellow, padded duelling-gloves, with gauntlets, or cuffs, to them long enough to cover the entire arm, and made after the manner of an English cricketer's leggings. Besides these, are seen huge duelling-breeches, made out of stuffed wash-leather, after the same cricketer's fashion, and intended to protect the entire bowels and legs of the duellists from the blows of their adversaries. Add to such peculiarities a few stores for the sale of the bright coloured and gold-embroidered muffin caps worn by the students, and others for the dispensation of Peppermint-schnapps, Eiimmel, and other liqueurs to the university scholars, at the doors of which generally stand the flauntily-dressed young women who are kept for the supply of the same, and whom the students have well denominated \"Schnapps Prinzessinen\" (brandy princesses), \u2014 and the external picture of the academic town of Jena is as graphic as we are able to sketch it. The collegiate buildings are, in an architectural point of view, utterly unworthy of notice. The college itself is a new, bare walled building, without the least pretension to ornament ; and,"], [281, "265 DRINKING-BOUTS OF THE JENA STUDENTS. immediately facing this is the Bibliotheque, the architect of which seems to have been ambitious of uniting every \"order\" under one and the same roof. The town, however, is pleasantly situate in the bosom of a narrow valley, watered by the. Saale ; while, close against the city walls, as it were, rise tbe several hills, capped with their different ruins, \u2014 such as the Fuchs-thurm, Eunitzburg, &c. \u2014 to each and all of which the students delight to mount, for, like the Germans in general, and his Satanic Majesty in particular, they are fond of \"exceeding high places.\" Jena was formerly celebrated for its seven wonders. These are particularized in the following Latin verses : \u2014 \" Ara, caput, draco, mons, pons, vulpecula turris Weigeliana domus : septem miracula Jen\u00e6.\" Angliee\" \u2014 \" Altar, head, and dragon, the hill, the bridge, the fox-tower. And the Weigelian house, are the seven wonders of Jena.\" The first of these wonders consisted of an altar with a subter ranean passage beneath it, and this is still existing in St. Michael's, the principal church of the city. The head, which constituted the second of the Jena wonders, was cut in stone on the bridge over the city moat outside the Lobder-gate. Concerning this stone head, the story runs, that a high-born adulterer was to forfeit his life for his crimes, but he promised to erect a stone bridge for the then existing wooden one, if his life were spared. The con dition was accepted by the town-authorities, and, in remembrance of the event, the builder of it had the image of his nearly-lost head sculptured upon the bridge. Next, we are told that some 250 years ago a party of students brought into the town a cleverly arranged skeleton of an animal with seven heads and many feet, which they gave out they had found in the devil's holes in the middle road leading to Ziegenhain. It was presented as the remains of a dragon to the library of the university, and is still preserved there as the third wonder of Jena. The fourth wonder was the Hausberg (or house mountain) which immediately over looks the village of Ziegenhain, and on the summit of which there formerly stood three \"majestic palaces, all belonging to the Count-palatine of Kirchberg. The fifth of the wonders was the Kamsdorf stone-bridge over the Saale, with nine arches, the building of which cost exactly a third more than the principal"], [282, "266 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. tower of the city. The sixth wonder was the \" Fox tower, which was erected on one of the highest hills in the neighbourhood of the town, and was no less than 71 feet high;\" whilst the seventh and last wonder of Jena was the Weigelian house, built by the mathematician, Erhard Wiegel, in 1668-70, where, by means of a well-staircase, which was always kept covered with black cloth, the stars could be seen at daytime from the cellars below. This \"wonderful\" house was also fitted with a hydraulic machine for supplying water to each of the rooms, even to the topmost storey ; so that, as the astonished chroniclers tell us, \"one had only to turn a tap at the upper part of the house, to have as much fresh water as could be required;'' for by an apparatus, \"depending on atmospheric pressure,\" as we are informed, Weigel could have a jug of fresh water brought mechanically up to his room, merely by having the same quantity poured into a tube in the cellar below. This house is still standing in the Johannis-street, and adjoins the Borough-cellar. Such, then, is Jena, with the exception of those taverns or hostelries, whereat the students take their meals and hold their drinking-bouts, and which are still the very genius of the place. Some of the more aristocratic Jena corps are in the habit of \"eating\" at the \"Black Bear;\" the \" Burg-keller \" (Borough cellar), on the other hand, is the principal resort of the student clubs, for here the Arminians and the Germanians are in the habit not only of assembling, but dining and passing their even ings, and a more primitive \"pot-house\" could hardly be met with in our own country. Here is a picture of the outside of it, copied from an excellent photograph by Dr. Schnauss, of Jena. The English artist has, however, at our instructions, added such external details as the students feasting and playing at the tables outside, in order to give something like animation to the utter lifelessness of an ordi nary photographic transcript. Within this building are the so-called club-rooms of the Ar minians and the Germanians \u2014 the former on the ground floor and the latter on the first storey. What might be the style of the apartment in which the Germanians assembled we are not in a position to state, never having been admitted into that select circle ; but of the hall devoted to the Arminian club we can con scientiously affirm that a more dingy, dirty tap-room could not be found throughout the entire length and breadth of our own country."], [283, "THE BOROUGH-CELLAR (Or Tavern where some of the Jena students hold their club-meetings.)."], [284, "268 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. The low walls are so thoroughly covered with small portraits of students who formerly belonged to the society that not a vestige of the plaster is to be seen. A large proportion of these like nesses consist of profiles in \"India-black\" (with the addition of a coloured student-cap) such as was common among our servant maids in those palmy pre photographic days when it was the custom with the vulgar to have a negro counterpart of their features cut out in black paper for a shilling, and their chain, brooch, or rings put in, in gold, for sixpence extra. A consider able number of the portraits, on the other hand, are ginger-bread coloured photographic presentments of \" old \" and \" departed Boys ;\" and many of these again are bedaubed with the same red, black, and bright colours as constitute the distinctive mark of the club. Moreover, some of the pictures consist of groups taken in the act of drinking together, with one or two of the company represented in their shirt-sleeves \u2014 as if this was a style of neglige\" of which the students were particularly proud. Then there are large, coarse lithographs of the entire club drinking together out in the woods, with a huge barrel of beer in the foreground, and the several students grouped in the most fan tastic attitudes ; and other prints besides, representative of the different student-customs, such as \" fox-riding,\" \" fox- baptizing,\" duelling, and the like. The picture-covered walls of the Armiuian club-room are the most striking feature of the place on first setting foot in it. Indeed, as you enter you have the impression that you have got into some cheap photographer's show-room by mistake ; for in no other place could such a collection of brown, Lascar-like heads be met with in our own country. The reason for this extensive portrait-gallery is, that the custom prevails throughout Germany for each person who is about to take his departure from any place where he has been resident for a time to present every one of his friends with a cheap copy of his own lineaments ; and the same usage holds good at Jena \u2014 with this exception, that the picture is given to the club itself rather than to the individual members of it, and under it is generally written, \"s'm. I. (i.e. seinem lieben) Eneipe\" (to his beloved drinking-club.) Another peculiarity of this public-house club-room are the old and dusty banners, that were once red, black, and yellow, nailed against the walls at the upper end of it, with crossed swords beside them, and a tin vizier, with a mangy black plume below ;"], [285, "DRINKING-BOUTS OF THE JENA STUDENTS. 269 while round the room are small shields, painted with the colours of the club. At the other end of the apartment, facing the dingy and ragged banners themselves, is a large black board that covers one-half of the wall, with the names of the several mem bers written thereon in different columns, and with perpendicular lines ruled down it, as if it were a leaf out of an enormous ledger or tradesman's day-book, for the setting down of the several groschens and pfennings which the students become iudebted to the landlord (or \"borough-councillor,\" as he is called by the boys) for beer in the course of the day. Such accounts are kept in chalk, after the approved public-house method of all countries ; and the score remains inscribed on the board until the following morning, when the student sees it entered in a book against his own name, where it remains until the account is settled at the end of each half-year. We have before stated what may be set down as the average expense of the beer consumed by the university scholars, and from a glance at the several daily scores thus openly kept in the club-room we are convinced that from five to seven groschens is less than the mean amount ; and for this sum (at three-farthings the pint) just upon a gallon of small-beer must be drunk by each of the students per diem. Of course, some take less and some more \u2014 the daily scores at the time of our visit ranging from twelve to twenty groschens, including the cost of the last night's supper ; and it should be borne iu mind that this amount of drinking goes on day after day, and represents by no means the quantity taken on festive occasions, and that by young men mostly between sixteen and twenty years of age. Indeed, at the celebration of one of the students attaining his doctorship, six of the boys drank no less than 144 (pint) glasses among them, which is at the rate of upwards of twenty-four glasses, or exactly three gallons, per head. To return, however, to the fittings of the student club-room ; we should add, that over the door is another black slate-like board, used for \" chalking down\" the meetings of the society \u2014 as well as the names of those who have to sit up with such as have been wounded in a duel \u2014 the celebration of any doctorship, or other feast \u2014 and any special matters requiring the attendance of the members. Another marked bit of furniture in the room was a huge clock case, such as used to be common to farm-houses and kitchens with us in the olden time ; nor would this be worthy of special"], [286, "270 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. mention were it not that one side of it was used by the president of the club (who sat next to it at every drinking-bout) for chalking down such beer-fines as were incurred by the members in the course of the evening. We have only to mention further, that long, narrow, and dirty deal tables stretched from one end of the club-room to the other, and that in the arched windows there were ranged smaller square ones, whereat the boys were wont to sit after dinner (when it was too wet or too cold for remaining out-of-doors) and play their game of \" Scat\" or \" Schnorps,\" while they drank their coffee or indulged in an extra \"portion\" of cherry-cake \u2014 and then our broker's inventory of the fittings of the Jena club-room (for it is impossible to do other than write catalogues in such cases) is ended. To this wretched, beggars' \" padding-ken \"-like apartment the young gentlemen of Saxony were in the habit of dropping in, one by one, as early as eleven o'clock every morning ; for it is the custom with all the students to have a sleeping-room somewhere in the town, the price for the apartments ranging from 7 to 25 thalers (21s. to SI. 15s.) the half-year, i.e. from 9Ji. to 2s. lOJd. the week. So far as we could ascertain, but a very small proportion of the \" boys\" were in the habit of attending the lectures regularly, the common practice with the students being to lead a loose convivial life for the first one or two years of their stay in Jena, and then to begin \"oxing,\" as it is termed \u2014 that is to say, giving them selves up to real hard work \u2014 so as to be able to pass the exami nation which is required of them, and which is of so severe a character that it often lasts for six weeks continuously. Many a student \" falls through,\" as it is called, at such ex aminations ; however, each is allowed to make three trials, and if he falls through upon every one of those occasions, he is utterly aud irrevocably \" plucked.\" One good point we heard of in connection with the study of medicine at this university that is worthy of recording here. It is the custom to give each of the medical students a village to attend to for one year previous to his examination, so that he may become practically acquainted with the art he is to pursue as a profession in after life ; and thus the poor of the district are sup plied with medical advisers (acting under the guidance of a duly qualified superintendent) free of expense. This strikes us as being as wise an ordination as that which compels the young"], [287, "271 DRINKING-BOUTS OF THE JENA STUDENTS. men who are qualifying themselves for the office of schoolmasters to act as teachers at the poor or free schools, without any re muneration whatever, for a certain terni before they become public preceptors. But if there be good points connected with the regulation of such matters in Germany, there are assuredly much greater evil ones ; and these are due principally to the despotic meddling of the fat-headed \" Ministerium\" with all affairs in which the Government of a country has no possible right to interfere. For instance, we asked a young medical student whether he meant to start in practice immediately after he had passed. \" I only wish I could,\" was his answer. \"And why can you not?\" we inquired. \"The Ministerium would not allow me,\" ran the reply. \" I must wait until I hear from them that there is a place vacant for me ; and then I must go wherever they may choose to send me.\" \" And how long do you suppose you will have to remain idle before you receive such an appointment?\" we went on. \" Oh ! some two or three years ; for that is the general course,\" he answered. \" And do you mean to say,\" we inquired, \" that the whole of that time, although the public examiners have pronounced you duly qualified for the practice of your profession, you are pro hibited by law from earning a pfenning by the exercise of it ? \" \" Most assuredly,\" returned the young man. \" If I took a groschen from any one as a fee I should incur heavy penalties ; and what is more,\" he added, \" even when the Government have given me an appointment to practise in a certain district, and I have been located there for a number of years, and got together a body of clients after a prolonged residence among the people, I am liable to be called away, and drafted off, at the pleasure of the Government, to an entirely new place, where, of course, I should have to begin anew.\" The young doctor concluded by telling us that so disheartened was he at such prospects that he intended to clear out for Paris, or perhaps America, as soon as he possibly could. Nor do these absurd governmental regulations prevail only in matters of medicine, but the same official officiousness holds good in the practice of the law also. We knew in Eisenach more than one person who had taken then degree as doctors of laws at the Saxon University, and yet were obliged to act as clerks in an attorney's office \u2014 simply because the Grand Duke's ministers"], [288, "272 GEliMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. thought there were advocates sufficient throughout the princi pality, aud therefore oljected to allow any more to earn their living by the practice of a pursuit, to tbe study of which they had devoted so much time and money, and for the exercise of which the public examiners had certified that they were duly fitted ! At eleven in the forenoon it is customary for the Arminians to come gradually dropping in to their club-room at the \" Borough cellar ;\" and so it goes on until just upon mid-day (for that is the dinner hour) by which time the \" boys \" are sure to be all assembled. Then the long, narrow, and dirty deal tables before spoken of are covered with a coarse table-cloth, and over this is placed a broad strip of black japanned canvas \u2014 so broad, indeed, that not a vestige of the white cloth is to be seen, except the edges of it hanging down at the sides. This is done, of course, to prevent the table-cloth itself being soiled ; but a more un sightly and poverty-stricken arrangement, in the eyes of those who have been accustomed to auything like decency at meals, it is impossible to conceive. Not a joint nor a dish appears upon the table ; nor, indeed, any appurtenance or ornament whatever. The tiny boy-waiters, in their short cloth-jackets, after the fashion of German waiters in general (for hardly any but boys serve at the hotels throughout the country), bring in the white earthen ware plates of watery soup, with bits of bread or small dumplings floating in it ; and when this has been eaten with leaden spoons, two plates of baked or boiled meat, with, maybe, a saucer of sour plums, or preserved cranberries, or else a small dish of salad, are placed before each of the members of the club ; and these being finished, perhaps a large sippet of apple, or cherry, or prune cake concludes the repast. We never dined at the \" Borough Cellar \" ourselves, for the simple reason that the very sight of the manner in which the meals were served and taken were enough to turn our stomach, rather than to whet our appetite ; and though we have eaten our eggs and bacon at many a road-side inn in our own country, and blessed God for the cleanly and simple meal, we never saw such a table spread for persons professing to possess the principles and tastes of gentlemen in the whole course of our life ; and we verily believe that at the lowest Yorkshire academy in England, the repast would have been more decently served, ay, and let us add, partaken of in a more refined manner bv the scholars \u2014 for, as we have said over and over again, it is impossible to find any Ger-"], [289, "DRINKING BOUTS OF THE JENA STUDENTS. 273 mans who are acquainted with the proper use of a knife and fork at table. Our readers now have as good a sense as we can give them of the Armiuian club-room, and the Arminian mode of living. It should, however, be borne in mind that the repast above described costs but five thalers ( 1 5s.) a head the month, and this is at the rate of but sixpence per diem ! Having exhausted this portion of our subject, we now proceed to give English people some idea of what constitutes a Eneip abend, or evening drinking bout, among the students of Jena. The word Eneipe is one that is more frequently used, perhaps, than any other by the Jena boys ; and yet it finds no place in the dictionaries of the country \u2014 in the sense which they apply to it. In the Wbrter-bucher, the word Eneipe is said to signify a gripe or pinch ; even as the verb kneipen is to pinch or nip, and Eneip zange, nippers, or literally nipping-tongs. Now, this is the same word as the Low Dutch knippen, to clip, nip, pinch, which, there is not the least doubt, is \u2014 with the elision of the initial k \u2014 the cognate of the English term nip, i. e. to pinch with the nails, teeth, or any instrument. But this seems to have not the least connection with drinking; the phrase, however, a \"nip of ale,\" or a \" nip of toddy,\" in which we find the same word used as sig nificant of a sip, or small draught, shows us that there is some ultimate connection between the words. The German, indeed, has the verb nippen, and the Danish nipper, to sip. Still, it is difficult to understand how the action of griping or pinching can be connected with that of drinking, since the one refers to the contraction of the muscles of the fingers, and the other to those of the mouth. Nevertheless, a reference to the origin of the idea of drinking itself clears up the philological mystery. In the Gothic language, dragyan means to give drink, even as in Spanish and Portuguese, the verb trager means to swallow, and the sub stantive trago stands for a draught ; and from these words no one in the least acquainted with the principles of etymology, can have a doubt that the idea of drinking was originally derived from that of dragging or drawing (for gg\u2014ng, as the Greek ayyeAos is the same as the Latin angelus, and the Gothic laggs the equivalent of the Anglo-Saxon long). Thus, then, we find that as we speak of a draught of beer, and a draught of fishes, so in nipping and kneiping the action of the one set of muscles is naturally transferred to the other ; and as 18"], [290, "274 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to pull with the hands and to pull with the mouth is the same, etymologically speaking, even so to gripe with the fingers or with the teeth or lips, are alike in philology. And hence it is easy to understand how the word \" nip,\" which means a pinch with the teeth as well as nails, should have come to signify a sip or small draught, Thus we come at last to perceive that the university term kneipen signifies literally to drink in a vulgar or greedy manner; for in German, a Eneip-schenke means a hedge inn or low tavern. Of these 2Tw\u00ab(p-evenings there are two in each week\u2014 the prin cipal one on the Saturday, and the secondary on the WTeduesday \u2014and, moreover, an Ex-kneipe. or additional drinking-bout, on the Sunday ; the latter being generally held at some of the taverns in the suburbs, and the others taking place at the club-room of the society. Such drinking-bouts prevail, not only with the stu dent-clubs, but with the corps also \u2014 the \" Finks \" alone, or those boys belonging to no society whatever, having no such custom. At each of these drinking-bouts the several members of the society are bound to attend, and to drink according to the beer usages before explained, unless they are announced as being \" beer-impotent, i. e. on the beer sick-list.\" In the summer-time, the commencement of the drinking-bouts often takes place outside the tavern-door, a long table being arrnged in the street, with forms and chairs on either side, and the whole of the students belonging to the club sitting there, and singing in the open air ; while tbe passers-by hardly think it worth their while to stop and listen to what they have heard a thousand and one times before. As soon as it grows dusk on such occasions, the whole of the company withdraw to the club room to finish the entertainment by the aid of caudle light, within the Borough Cellar itself. The proceedings usually commence at eight o'clock, and all are bound to remain and take part in them, until the third song is finished, which is not until ten at night, as a rule ; after which, any one is at liberty to retire \u2014 though the generality of the members stay until eleven, the hour at which all the public-houses are bound by law to close. The songs sung upon such occasions are by no means of a light or frivolous character. Indeed, it is part of the laws of each club that at least two solemn or serious songs shall form part of the enterteinment of such evenings. These solemn songs are mostly of a patriotic or academic character, and intended to remind"], [291, "DRINKING BOUTS OF THE JENA STUDENTS. 275 the youths of the principles they are sworn to uphold. However, so as to vary the entertainment, the president is at liberty to allow a \" Hospitium,'' or tavern-song, of a lighter or more convi vial turn, to be sung between the others. Still, let us say, in all justice to the Arminian boys, that though we were present at many of their drinking-bouts, we never heard a coarse word, or even an indecent allusion, uttered by one of them ; and that such obscene ditties as used to prevail at the \"Cider Cellars\" and other \" fast\" places of public resort in the British Metropolis, we verily believe could not possibly be heard in any of the student clubs of Jena. However, dismissing from the mind all idea of these out-of door drinking and singing festivities, the reader must now sup pose that the huge kitchen clock of the club-room has marked eight ; that the long deal tables, before mentioned, have been arranged close against that side of the room where the clock-case stands ; that the president of the club has taken his seat next to the clock-case itself; that the Schriftwart (or guardian of the books and manuscripts belonging to the club) has drawn from out of the locker the several song-books of the University boys and distributed them among the company ; that those who have come in late have removed the little black mackintosh coverings from their embroidered muffin caps (such coverings being gene rally worn after dark so as to protect the gold thread from the influence of the night air) ; that the entire thirty of the boys belonging to the society are ranged on either side of the tables with ourself and our son at one end of them (allowed as a special privilege to form part, of the company) ; that almost every one of the youths is provided with a pipe as long as a trombone ; that the majority have taken off their coats, and appear in their shirt sleeves, and that each has his wooden can of white beer standing before him ; and that every boy, moreover, has come duly provided with the door-key of his lodging, attached to the strap of his waistcoat. Then the president cries \" Silentium ! the drinking-bout is opened with the first song.\" Whereupon he proceeds to give out, after the fashion of a parish clerk at a country church, the title and the number of the strain in which the students are to join. The following is one of the songs generally sung upon such occasions. It is given in as literal an English form as possible, and the reader who will take the trouble to peruse our version of"], [292, "276 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the lay will have some notion of the semi-religious sentiments which prevail among the youths on such occasions. Nor is the melody in any way paltry or inelegant ; and when we heard the entire assembly of boys giving it forth, with the lustiest-possible lungs, we must confess we wondered how it was that lads who believed in such high notions could sink in after life to be men so utterly callous to the welfare of their country that they were ready to submit patiently to any indignity which their rulers might choose to put upon the people.

It should be noted that the above song is not necessarily the one first sung at such times. Indeed, there are in the Jena Song book no less than 118 of such Lieder given as those peculiar to the students, and we have selected the one above cited merely as being significant of the principles of the Jena boys. Often at these drinking-bouts are given out the subjoined Latin verses, which are known throughout Germany as the \" Students' Hymn.\" We have left the words in their original tongue, because any attempt at translation would but mar the classic picturesqueness of the university lay ; and the fine solemn strain of the melody, especially when sung by many voices, is a thing that when once heard cannot readily be forgotten.

The song being finished, a pause ensues, and then begins the frolic customary to boys all over the world, distinguished, never theless, by such national peculiarities as can be found only among the university students of Germany. Now one lad cries out to the other, \" Mama \" (the nick-name of some student\u2014 for the boys are never addressed by their proper patronymics) \" I drink a gulp to thee,\" or \" I drink a cow-gulp to thee,\" according to the thirstiness of the inviting party. \" Swill ! \" responds the other ; and after a few minutes, the one who has been drunk-to cries, \" Long One ! I drink after thee.\" Whereupon, the second boy swallows precisely the same quantity as the other has previously drunk to him. Or, ma)- be, one says to another, who has just had a fresh can of beer brought in, \" Prosit deine Blume ! \" (literally, \" Bless thee to the extent of thy froth ! \" \u2014 or, as the lads call it, \" flowers,\" upon the top of the newly-drawn beer.) \"Prosit! \" cry the two lads ; and then, knocking their cans together, they drink until such froth or bloom has entirely disappeared. Now general conversation begins, and one lad inquires, \" Have you seen Schack to-day ? How's his nose getting on ? \" (This refers to some one of the members, who has received a deep cut on his olfactory organ in the course of a recent duel.) \"Jai\" responds the boy, \"he's going on nobly (herrlich). He had the threads taken out of his nose this morning.\" Another says that he has heard from the \" weapon guardian \""], [295, "DRINKING-BOUT'S OF THE JENA STUDENTS. 279 that he is fixed for his duel next Monday, and all he wishes is that he may get ac rooked cut over the cheek, for that is the scar which he specially delights in (alter liebster Schmitzchen). When such conversation has been indulged in for some quarter or half an hour, the president again cries, \" Silentium ! for the Hospitium ; \" adding, \" Vivat Beer-Frederick,\" as he calls upon the one known by that sobriquet to lead the lay. This ditty, as we have before stated, is of a less serious cha racter than the others, aud the foUowing may be taken as a type of the class. HOW ONE LIVES IN JENA* i.

' I come thee (that is, I drink to thee) a half\" (measure, understood). \" Swill!\" cries the \"Little One,\" and in a few minutes after wards shouts across the table, \" 'Fat One,' I come after thee!\" and thereupon the \"Little One\" drinks the same quantity as the \"Fat One\" has previously drunk to him. Then the Foxes (or those young lads who are passing their first half-year at Jena) become impudent towards the \" Fox major,\" an official who is specially elected to instruct the young students in the art of drinking according to the customs of the"], [299, "DRINKING BOUTS OF THE JENA STUDENTS. 283 university ; and, rising in a body, they sing to their superior the following words : \u2014 SONG OF THE FOXES TO THE FOX-MAJOR. Fox-major ! Fox-major ! foxes are dry and would drink some more ! Fox-major ! Fox-major ! foxes are dry and would drink some more ! Who's lying without in front of the door ? It's only the drunk'n old Fox-major. Fox-major ! Fox-major ! Foxes are dry and would drink some more ! And when this bit of merriment has been gone through, the Fox-major himself stands up, and cries, \"Silentium! Ye Foxes. I drink the fourth, fifth, and sixth glasses!\" and then tosses off an entire can as a sign that the young Foxes are to follow his example. Indeed, as a rule, the Foxes can drink only after, and at, the command of their beer-tutor, and they are bound to swallow as many cans as he himself can imbibe. On one of the evenings on which we were present this same Fox-major compelled the boys to drink no less than fifteen little cans (or pints) of beer; but, said one of the Foxes aside to us (he was a young American), \"That swindler of a Fox-major does not take half the beer he orders us to swallow.\" Then, may be, in the pauses between the songs, you will hear two of the boys discussing across the table, whether the true object of Eunst (art) be beauty or power ; and whether the artist is really admirable, on account of the beautiful or the powerful effect which his works produce upon the mind. And as the subject expands in the course of the argument, it takes the usual turn as to the difference between the real and the ideal, while illustrations are cited by the lads, not alone from the writings of Gothe and Schiller, but even from those of Shakespeare, Bulwer, and Dickens, with which they show themselves to be as intimately acquainted as they are even with the works of their own country men \u2014 one speaking of the wonderful vividness of the character of \"Sam Veller,\" and declaring it to be quite as ideal in its way as Falstaff himself \u2014 and another lauding the \" Last Days of Pom peii,\" as the most elegantly classic work of fiction of this or any other time \u2014 till the Englishman listening to the discussion be comes astounded at the erudite knowledge and refined literary tastes of youths whose lives are apparently given up to the mere conviviality of \"Kneiping\" or beer-drinking."], [300, "284 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. At the same time as this is going on, another knot of boys, who are studying theology, will be arguing, most probably, as to the errors of the Nominalists and Realists of the Middle Ages \u2014 discussing the respective merits of the Aristotelian and Baconian methods of philosophy; one standing out for the inductive system, and the other upholding the a priori method of reasoning ; this boy asserting Law to transcend Experience, and that lad declar ing Experiment and the Interpretation of Phenomena to be the only true means of acquiring scientific knowledge ; so that as the stranger notes the odd mixture of metaphysics and duelling, of high art, thoughtless foolery, and profound guzzling, he is be wildered as to the inconsistencies of youths, whom he finds marked at once by the loftiest sentiments and the most swinish habits \u2014 the highest mental tastes and the very lowest bodily ones. At this point of the evening the president has, perhaps, occa sion to leave the room, whereupon the more jovial of the boys cry out, \"Now let us have a song to ourselves!\" and they imme diately strike up some such strain as the following \u2014 especially if a foreigner happen to be present: \u2014 PROUD ENGLAND! Proud England ! learn delightfully, Thy King he swills most frightfully ; Thy red nos'd, thy red nos'd, Thy jolly red-nos'd King. Fallera! In the middle of this outburst, may be, the president returns to the room, and cries, \"Silentium!\" whereupon all is hushed in a minute ; and immediately on resuming his seat, he demands to know who was bold enough to give out a song in his absence. For a time, no one mentions the names of the offenders ; but at length, upon the president threatening to fine them a horn of beer all round, the culprits are given up, and they alone are punished to the same extent. Then the horn is brought in \u2014 the said horn being an enormous bull's horn, duly polished, and mounted as a drinking vessel, and filled to the brim with beer \u2014 and this is handed round to the company, each saying as he drinks, \" Prosit Horn!\" somewhat after the fashion of the loving-cup circulated at our Lord Mayor's feasts."], [301, "DRINKING BOUTS OF THE JENA STUDENTS. 285 This ceremony having been gone through, the president cries \"Silentium!\" for the third and last song of the drinking-bout; and then may be he orders them to sing No. 24 of the Studenten Lieder, this being one of the most popular of the university drink ing-songs, and of which the following is a literal translation:\u2014^ DRINKING-SONG (Sung at the Students' principal Erinking-houts) .

Which the lark upw akes to melody ! Directly this is concluded, the president cries once more, \" Silen tium ! the drinking-bout is at an end ;\" whereupon the \" weapon guardian,\" who has to see to all the arrangements of the duels, urders all those boys who have fights to come off within a day or two to retire to their beds. Accordingly each of the lads who is appointed to \"go loose,\" rises slowly and leaves the room, ac companied by the friend who has been elected as his beer guardian for the time being, in order to prevent him drinking too much previous to the encounter \u2014 it being the duty of such guardians to take the others home at night, and to take care that the boys whom they have under their charge indulge in no more than three little cans of beer in the course of each evening. After this the \" weapon-guardian,\" who is also the duel-super intendent, demands to know who is willing to serve as the night watch for the brother-student who has been recently wounded in au encounter. \" I'll go from twelve till two,\" cries one, aud thereupon his name is chalked down on the board over the door. Another excuses himself, saying, \" I was there the night be fore last, and I've to be at college early in the morning ;\" while a third cries, \"I'll keep the watch from two till four, if some one will come and wake me and bring the cards along with him,\" and so it goes on until the black board is filled with the names of those who are willing to sit up with their wounded brother. Now, the evening's formalities having ceased, the boys begin to sing all kinds of merry songs. One that they specially delight to indulge in at such times is called the \" Beer Waltz.\" Or else, may be, those who remain till the end of the enter tainments sing together the following pretty drinking-song : \u2014"], [303, "IK the \"basket\" (Or Jena Boi/s sitting up with a \"Brother\" who has been recently toounded in a Duel)."], [304, "288 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS.

So one jumps up and says, \"Who'll go bomineling\" (that is, dangling or loitering) \" in the streets ? \" And no sooner are the words uttered than the boys, who know well enough the meaning of the phrase, rise in a body and sally forth ready to pick a quarrel with any other of the student-clubs or corps whom they may chance to encounter ; for the reader will perhaps remember that it is part of the laws of each student-club that none of then members shall mix themselves up in idle brawls ; and therefore the word \" bom meling\" is used, so that the club itself may have no previous knowledge of the riot. \" Now,\" said our American friend to us, \"if you want to see how the duels are' brought about at the German universities, you had better go after those boys ; for, in the state they are in, there will be no end of challenges to-night.\" And before we could get our hat, we heard sung in the street the following air, which is known by the title hereunder given ; \u2014 CHALLENGING SONG OF THE ARMENIANS. i.

By the time we had left the tavern, we could only see the boys, in the glimmer of the expiring oil-lamps (for gas is yet unknown in the Saxon seat of learning), walking six abreast down the narrow streets of the university-town, and hear their melodious challenging-song floating upon the night wind. Presently, iu the distance there was heard the following musical response to the defiant chant of the Arminians : \u2014 CHALLENGING SONG OF THE JENA \" CORPS.\" Yoh hey ! rassasah ! and the Franks 1 the Westphalians I- cry \" holla!\" the Thuringians J The Franks they ~\\ Westphalians >are joyous and shouting \"Hurrah!\" Thuringians J \" Now.\" said the light-hearted American lad who accompanied us, \" you'll see something of the Jena ways ;\" and scarcely were the words uttered, before we came up to a crowd of students wrangling each with the other; for it is the custom with the boys, who are anxious to distinguish themselves in the art of duelling, to walk six or more abreast, so that no party similarly spread out can possibly pass them without jostling together; and immediately the challenging-song of one club is heard in the streets, the boys of the other societies go out in a body to meet them, intent upon picking a quarrel with the others. By the time we had reached the crowd, we heard the words \" dummer Junge!\" (Stupid youngster!) flying about on every side In all the university towns of Germany such an expression is sufficient to provoke a duel ; and every one of the students 19"], [306, "290 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. assured us that these words are the means of preventing many an unseemly brawl in the streets, since, immediately they are uttered, a challenge is the consequence, and the whole dispute is at an end. Then one says to another, \"Give me your card;\" anil the other replies, \" Oh, yes ! you want it to stick in your looking glass, to show that you have got at lea->t one gentleman among your acquaintance.\" \" Very well,\" cries the first ; \" I shall send a friend to you in the morning.\" \" Thank you,\" replies the second one, \" for the information. I'll give directions to my servant to have all the spoons locked up, so that none of the plate may be missing when your friend leaves.\" And so the noise goes on. \"Who's in the second Semester?\" \"Who's in the third Semester?\" shouts first one and then another. \" Here ! Here ! \" respond some of the opposite party. \" Can I have the pleasure of hanging (fighting) with you?\" inquires the previous speaker. \" Oh, certainly ! I am at your service,\" says the other. And thus the duels of the Jena boys are brought about and arranged. May be, at this point of the affray, Herr Knoblauch (literally, Mr. Garlic), one of the beadles and night-watchmen of the town, makes his appearance, done up in a hackney-coachman's huge greatcoat, and carrying a thick stick and lantern in his hand. whereupon he is immediately surrounded by the whole crowd of boys, each anxious to shake hands with him, and crying, \" Oh, beloved Herr Knoblauch, how goes it with you?\" \" It's an age since we met,\" says one. \" I've had longing pains to see you, darling Knoblauch,\" adds another. '\u2022 And how goes it with the sainted Mrs. Knoblauch?\" asks a third. \" She was looking divinely last time I saw her, in the very hat and feathers I meant to have bought her myself,\" chimes in a fourth. \" And the sweet little Knoblauch-chens \u2014 I trust, my good friend, that your father's heart is not wounded with any distress on their account ? \""], [307, "291 DRINKING-BOUTS OF THE JENA STUDENTS. And so it goes on, each poking his fun at the good-tempered beadle, who cannot help laughing at the boys, even while he pre tends to be angry with them on account of the disturbance in the streets at so late an hour. \"Now do go home, my good young gentlemen,\" he says ; \"I shall have to report s-ome of you as it is. I must do it in the morning, but I shall make it as light as I can.\" \" Yes, dear Knoblauch ; we were holding a prayer-meeting, that was all. Will you, beloved Knoblauch, be so good as to conduct us to the nearest pump, for we haven't moistened our lips, dear Knoblauch, for the last twelve hours ? '' \" Do you want a godfather for your next child, respected Kno blauch ? If so, you may command me,'' adds one of the more uproarious of the boys. At length, however, by dint of long persuasion on the part of Mr. Garlic, the boys are dispersed. Some go home to their rooms, where they remain singing out of the windows and across the street to one another. Others of the boys go off to indulge in some \" Nacht-scandal,\" as it is called (or night offence), and then practical jokes are in dulged in by the small-beer-elated youths to an indefinite extent \u2014 the principal of such jokes consisting in transferring the signs of the liquor-shops to the apothecaries', and those of the medicine stores to the houses where more palatable potions are supposed to be retailed. Of course, all such matters have to be duly reported by the watchmen to the senate the next day, when the offenders are summoned before the heads of the university, and sentenced to certain terms of imprisonment in the \" Career \" (pronounced \" kartzer \") or lock-up, by the college authorities. Some few years back, it was customary with the several stu dent-societies, whenever any of their members were condemned to be confined for a term in the university lock-up to form a pro cession, and accompany their brethren through the streets to the place of \" durance vile \" \u2014 each of the culprits being decorated with what is called the \" prison-band.\" Such processions, how ever, are now forbidden. This prison-band, nevertheless, continues to be carried by the boys who are sentenced to imprisonment. The colours of the said band are brown, white, and black \u2014 brown standing for beer, white for innocence, and black for revenge ; and the motto being, \"Bier, Unschidd, und Bache.\""], [308, "292 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. We have before explained, that none of the members belonging to a particular club or student-corps will fraternize or even speak with those connected with another society, unless the two unions happen to be (which seldom occurs) upon what is termed \" Freund schaft-verhdltniss \" i. e. upon friendly terms. But when the mem bers of the different clubs chance to be imprisoned together, all such asperities cease; and then, no matter whether the fellow prisoners be \"Finches\" or not, brotherly love prevails among the incarcerated. Another curious custom at such times is. that all the university forms are reversed \u2014 the evening drinking-bout being held in the morning, and the Friih-kneipe, or morning revel, taking place in the evening, and so forth. Moreover, it is a rule with the incar cerated students never to wash themselves, nor comb their hair, nor brush their clothes, so long as they are in the \" lock-up,\" those who do so being heavily fined by their fellow-prisoners ; so that the boys who are sentenced to eight or more days' confine ment in the \" Career \" make their appearance in the town at the end of the term in a state of dirt and untidiness that is regarded with the highest admiration by their brother members on their return to the club. The most wretched lot, however, is when one boy is confined in the \" Career \" alone, for then he is left to give forth smoke-rings, while he vows vengeance against those who have imprisoned him \u2014 as represented in the characteristic engraving (on the next page), which is a literal transcript of a Jena print, and will give the reader a better sense of what occurs on such occasions than any words of ours Under the guidance of Herr Knoblauch, the university beadle, we were taken to inspect the College Prison. This is situate at the back of the College church, in an old building that was for merly a cloister, in connection with the church itself. Here are some half-dozen quondam-monkish cells, the ceilings, floors, walls, and doors of which are literally covered with the names of the students who have been imprisoned therein. The names ou the ceiling have mostly been printed with candle smoke, and those on the flooring and the door can-ed with a knife, while ou the walls they are painted, and generally accompanied with some rude device, as well as an inscription recording the date and term of the writer's imprisonment. The several chambers here have different titles, given to them by the students ou account of cer tain marked peculiarities. There is, for instance, the \" Wa.ppen-"], [309, "OBDINAItY OCCUPATION OF TnE JENA BOYS WUEN CONFINED ALONE IN THE UNIVEESITY LOCK-IT n la a a o"], [310, "294 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. simmer,\" or escutcheon-chamber, the walls of which are decorated with the coats-of-arms of each of the different studeut-societies, with a list of the members underneath who have been confined therein. Then there is the \" Billiard-zimmer,'' so called on account of the enormous square wooden bedstead placed in one corner of it, aud which certainly is more like a billiard-table than an ordinary German bed. Here, when the other cham bers are full, some two or three boys are put to sleep together, each of the inmates having to bring his own mattrass and cover ing. Further, there is the \" Pepita Chamber,\" or that in which the figure of a ballet-dancer, almost the size of life, has been painted on the wall by one of the imprisoned students; and lastly, the \"Ladies' Chamber,\" but why so designated we do not exactly remember. Moreover, all along the passage leading to the several cells the walls are ornamented with curious caricature drawings, among which we may mention a rough sketch of \" Bacchus in the Career;\" while in the cells themselves the dates attached to many of the names on the wall extend as far back as the end of the last century; for the authorities will not allow the place to be whitewashed, on account of the curiosity of the in scriptions. Facing the University Justice-Room in the same building (where the offenders of the previous night are examined and sen tenced to certain terms of imprisonment, according to the cha racter of their offences), there is another small cell, which is no longer used as a place of durance, owing to the excellent comic cartoons with which the walls are scribbled over. These were done by one Distelli, a Swiss student, and Euge, a German (the latter of whom is now an exile resident in England), in the year 1812, and considered so remarkable by the late Grand Duke, Carl August, that he gave orders that the chamber should be kept in its present state as long as possible. The drawings, though certainly clever, are by no means such extraordinary efforts of genius as the Jena folk generally believe them. They are sketches in charcoal, representative of Maiius weeping over the ruins of Carthage ; of the Rape of the Sabines ; and the Devil pitchforking the Pope into the infernal regions \u2014 all executed with con>iderable freedom, and no little humour. The boys confined in the lock-up are allowed to have in two bottles of beer per diem (at their own expense). It is customary with the students, however, 011 entering the place, to take as many"], [311, "DRINKING-BOUTS OF THE JENA STUDENTS. 295 bottles of wine with them as they can carry in their pockets (for the turnkeys have no power to search them), and for their friends to bring them a further supply daily during their imprisonment; so that card-playiug and drunkenness invariably prevail in the Career, so long as any two boys are fellow-prisoners there. Whenever one is confined alone, however, the hours do not fly quite so swiftly \u2014 blowing smoke-rings being then the chief amusement."], [312, "CHAPTER XXIV. OF THE DUELS AT JF.NA. There are but a sew other college customs to be mentioned before we come to that which \u2014 after beer \u2014 forms the principal one, viz. duelling ; for small beer and small swords are the main delights of Jena boys. It is utterly impossible to obtain, in a week or two, the know ledge that requires a year or more to become acquainted with ; so, as we make it a rule never to deal with matters upon which we are insufficiently informed, and there still remained certain Jena ceremonies which had not come under our notice during our stay in the town, we wrote to a young American, who was studying at the college, and was a member of the Arminian club, to favour us with an account of those matters which had not come within the narrow circle of our experience, and we now append the answer. First, then, he says, \"A commerce is, as you know, a Jena drinking-bout, to which other than members of the student-club are invited. Of such commerces there are six every year. There are, of course, two Semesters annually ; at the beginmng of each of which there is an ' entrance commerce,' and a ' departure com merce' at the end of them. In June, moreover, there is a 'foun dation commerce,' and another commerce also at Christmas. \"The four commerces (that is to say, those at the beginning aud those at the end of the two Semesters) are inferior ones, last ing only one day and being something like a Eneip-abend, but on a larger scale. I will describe, as well as I can, what occurred at our foundation commerce. \"The elder members of the society, as well as the boys belong ing to the University of Erlaugen, having been invited to attend. we made preparations to receive them ; some went over to Weimar to welcome the Erlaugen students, and escort them to Jena. This"], [313, "297 OF THE DUELS AT JENA. occurred on the 11th of June, and the weather was wretched in the extreme, for it rained 'flint-stones,' as the Germans say, all the time. A number of us Arminian Boys walked out to the 'Oil-mill,' but the rain came down so heavily that we were forced to return before long. At length our guests made their appearance, and then a cry for dry clothes and quarters was raised. I opened my heart, my wardrobe, and my bedroom-door, and took one hard looking individual in ; and I think he was much more satisfied than I was during his stay. \" Everything having been done for the comfort of our new friends, the Vor-kneipe (that is, the introductory drinking-bout) commenced, and by half-past 11 p.m., we were as merry a set of young fellows as any one but a temperance-man would wish to see. \" The next morning we had Friih-kneipe (i. e. the early drinking bout), at which beer and herrings disappeared at a marvellous rate. In the evening the commerce-proper began \u2014 a large number of pro fessors and others being present on the occasion. Then speeches, songs, and bad white beer were indulged in, until the professors and Philisters retired : after which the ceremony of the Landes vater (fatherland) commenced. \" Two long tables were ranged round the hall, whereat the boys were seated. At the end of each table stood two presidents, so that there were eight in all, every one of them being in hat and feathers, with white gauntlets, and with rapiers at their side. I should add that two members of the Germanian club were present at this ceremony, they having been sent as delegates to our society ; for the Arminians happened to be on friendly terms with them at the time. \"Then the presidents all stood up on the chairs that were made vacant by the boys immediately in front of them rising from their seats, and each holding a naked blade in the left hand, and a gob let of beer in the other, while something was sung, the words of which I have forgotten. The swords were now taken hold of by the lads standing up in front of each of the presidents, and as they held the rapiers in their left hand, they proceeded to pierce their caps, every one at the same time, while they drank and sang. \" Then the swords were handed on to the lads next to them to do the same, the cap of each being passed down the rapier-blade till they had the appearance of so many muffins on a toasting fork ; and so it went on1 until the whole of them had been perfo rated in the same manner.\""], [314, "298 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. \" After this,\" continues our young American friend, \"came the baptism of the Foxes, when the Kaiserin, or Empress (who is re presented by one of the boys duly attired for the occasion), was seated on a barrel, both ends of which had been previously knocked out, and the cask being so arranged that the head of it was behind the scenes, while the bottom of it was turned towards the stage.

These \" beer-honours,\" as they are called, consist of certain stars and crosses, &c, cut out of tin and painted with the colours of the club. They are rewards for drinking a \" double battery\" (which is equal to six abbots, or half-pint measures), at one draught \u2014 a \" single battery \" (or half the quantity of the double"], [316, "300 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. one)\u2014 a double abbot (or pint) \u2014 a single abbot (or half-pint)\u2014 a can (or quart) and Cannchen (or half-can). On such occasions as that above described, it is the practice with the members of the club to challenge each other to drink given quantities, and which ever swallows the stated quantum first, becomes entitled to one or other of the honours above mentioned, according to tbe amount taken down. We were told of two of the \" boys \" challenging one another to drink off a double battery, i.e. six half-pint mea sures, one after the other. One of the lads broke down in the attempt, and had to retire from the room to be ill, after swallowing the fifth measure ; whereas the other did manage to get down the sixth half-pint, but had no sooner done so than he was sick out of window. We saw the envied beer-honour, thus won, han\"iiifr against the wall at the lodging of the winner. \" The ceremony being concluded,\" continues our American friend, \" we scattered ; but my guest had (as we say on the other side of the Atlantic) ' a good lip for liquors ;' so on his account I helped him in looking after the punch, uutil it was all gone \u2014 by which time it was five o'clock in the morning, and we were both ready for bed. \" But,\" he adds. \" there is no rest for the wicked ; for at eleven the next day the Katcr-friihstiick\" (literally, the seedy or ' hut- copper' breakfast) \" commenced, For this we assembled at the Borough Cellar, and then wine only was partaken of.

To tell the truth, after three o'clock I myself was not in a state to distinguish any one whomsoever. I woke up during the night, and found myself in my own bed ; but how I got there is, to this day, a mystery to me. In fine, of the whole party there was none sober enough to conduct the others to then- lodgings. \" The next morning there was a Spritzc excursion to Dorn- burg, and the boys all came back in the same condition a- they went to bed the day before. After that, the examination of the Foxes went on. This consists in three of the Boys resolving themselves into a Fox justice-court, and proposing questions to the younger students. If the Foxes cannot answer them they are punished by having to order in a certain number of glasses. While this was going on, Braisecke demanded a court of appeal to try the Fox-judges ; but as he had to be taken home before"], [317, "301 OF THE DUELS AT JENA. the time came for trying them, and as there was no other person sober enough to act as prosecutor, the matter was dropped. \" Next day the beer state-officers were elected, of which the club have already presented you with the picture.\" Whereupon the young American breaks off, saying, that what with dinners aud visits in Dresden (whither he had retired in the vacation), he is about \" played out.\" The English reader has now as full a sense of the Jena cus toms as we and our friends can give him.

But, before dealing with those sung on the Eneip evenings of every week, we shall cite one of the special ditties sung by students on other occasions, as it is illustrative of an interesting ceremony which occurred during our stay in Jena. It is entitled \" The Song of a Departing Boy \" (Lied eines abziehenden Burschen), and is indulged in chiefly when a \" moss covered head,\" or old student who has taken his degree, is about to leave the University for ever. The departure at such a time is no simple leave-taking, but consists of a long and imposing ceremony. As soon as the mid day dinner is finished, an open carriage-and-fbur appears in the Johannis street in which the tavern where the Armins hold their meetings is situate, On such an occasion every member of the club is expected to be present ; and when all is ready for starting, the carriage draws up to the tavern-door. But the departing student, instead of entering the vehicle, is conducted by the entire members of the club, all walking in procession through the streets of the town, to the first inn in the suburbs, while the open and empty carriage-and-four follows in the wake. At the head of the train walks the departing student himself, between two of the oldest members of the club ; and after them march the other \" boys \" two-and-two, and all arm in-arm ; while beyond these come the \" Foxes\" in the same order, with the empty carriage-and-four, as we have said, bringing up the rear, and with the driver in full postilion-costume, with his feather in his hat, and his bright bugle dangling at his side. No sooner has the procession begun to move, slowly and mournfully, along the streets, than the brother-members of the student-club commence singing, as they go, the plaintive melody hereafter given. The German words of the song we have rendered as literally as possible, but in some cases it was found difficult to discover an equivalent expression in English for the original German phrase. For example, the first line of this Studenten-lied means literally \" a moss-covered Boy I go away ;\" but as English readers would find no sense in such an idiom, we have applied the epithet \" reverend \" instead ; for it is the idea of the moss clinging to an ancient ruin or to some old forest-tree that has given rise to the original figure. With such exceptions, however, the German words are rendered as literally as can be,"], [320, "304 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. so that the verses may convey to a foreigner not only an idea of the Jeua customs but of the affections of these same Jena boys also. In the following song, it will be seen that the word \" Phi listers'' occurs in the second line. This is the German for Philistines, and the reason of such a term being applied by the students to the citizens of ever}' University town is thus explained in the Jena guide-book : \u2014 \" Of the old towers and gates (which anciently formed the entrances to Jena) the square one to the west still remains ; and this is remarkable, not only for its prison (called the 'cheese banket '), for improper women, but also for the four images of monkeys' heads cut in stone at the several corners of the tower itself. At a quarrel. between the Jena students and the inhabit ants in the vicinity of the Johannis-gate, the university ' boys ' called the gate-watchmen there \u2014 'the monkey-watchmen.' The watchmen, angered at this, vowed vengeance, and, assembling one evening, they killed a young student who had taken no part in the disturbance. The ecclesiastical superintendent, Gotze, preached a sermon at the funeral of the boy from the text \u2014 ' The Philistines be upon thee, Samson ' (Judges xvi. 20), and on the evening of the same day the words echoed in every street, ' Philister Uber Dir, Simson!' From that hour the citizens of Jena were called 'Philisters' by the students, and the name being carried to other universities, it came at length to be applied bv the college ' boys ' throughout Germany to the whole of the burgher-folk. According to some, this fight occurred in 1093 at the inn bearing the sign of ' The Yellow Angel.' \" \u2014 (Jena and its Environs, by Dr. J. Giinther, p. 14 ) The singing of the song on the occasion above referred to was nothing less than exquisite, while the pathetic refrain of the words \" Adieu ! Adieu ! \" sounded almost as solemnly as the repeated tolling of a death-bell in the ear ; and the simple and touching burden at the end of every verse, \" Scheiden und Meiden thut weh!\" (Anglice, \" Parting rends the heart in two,\") sounded like the dirge for some departed soul, rather than the lament for a departing friend. Indeed, we never listened to music or theme that so stirred our nature ; and we can well understand the truth of what we were told at the time, that many an \" old boy,\" when it comes to his turn to hear his young friends chant the selfsame song to him for the first and only time in his life, listens to it with the tears in his eyes ; as if it were some \" dead march \" hymned at"], [321, "OF THE DUELS AT JENA. 305 the last obsequies of the brightest and happiest portion of his existence. lt is impossible for those who play and sing the song at the piano (without all the fitting circumstances of time and place, as well as of sundered ties and long-remembered friendships, or, indeed, without the sorrowful speculations as to whether the happy time passed among these young brother-students was ever to be renewed in after-life) to have any vivid sense of the fine emotions which such associations naturally engender in the mind when it is heard for the first time, as we heard it ourselves, forming part of the train of friends, and seeing each of the young fellows walk with his head bent as thongh he were marching to a grave !

ANOTHER FAREWELL SONG. (Sung, so the same tune as the preceding, on the departure of a Student from College). Three riders ride forth from the city rate : Adieu ! Three maids at the windows they watch and wait : Adieu ! \" If God then so wills it that thou must be gone, Take this ring as a keepsake, and God's will be done ! \" Adieu ! Adieu ! Adieu !

Singing such songs, and marching in the same order, and each with the head bent in the same manner, and the same empty carriage-and-four sauntering along in the wake, the pro cession at last reaches the tavern called the \" Oel-miihle\" (Oil mill), which is the first on the road to Apolda (the nearest rail way station to Jenaj, where the host, as is common in Germany, carries on a double trade, e.g. of expressing oil from seeds, aud groschens from the students' pockets for the small-beer which he supplies to them. This tavern and oil-mill is a good quarter of an hour's walk from the university-town ; and here it is the custom for the carriage and the students to halt, so that the latter may drink their parting glass with the \" abziehende Bursche,\" while the postilion is removing from the vehicle the two extra horses which are used merely as a means of giving greater show to the ceremony in the town itself. During this, the students retire in a body to the arbours ranged round the garden : and when they are all seated at the tables, and a full can of white beer has been placed before each of them, the president of the society \u2014 or guardian of the drinking bouts, as he is also called (Eneip-wart) \u2014 rises, and having cried \" Silentium!\" makes a brief speech, in which he reminds the members of the club that their dear brother is about to leave them. He recalls the happy days they have passed in his com pany \u2014 hopes that such happiness maybe renewed hereafter \u2014 and concludes by wishing the departing Boy every prosperity in the career upon which he is about to enter. The five minutes' speech being ended, he then calls upon the rest to drink to the departing brother with all the honours ; whereupon he cries, \" One is one ! Two is two ! Three is three !\" and then the united assembly proceed to \" rub a salamander\" in honour of the departing \" Boy,\" and accordingly they begin twist ing their cans round and round for several times upon the table ; and finally with a universal shout of \"Live well ! \" (Lebe wohl!) they, one and all, empty the contents of the wooden vessels at a draught. A few minutes' silence then occurs, after which the departing Boy himself rises to thank them all for their kind words and wishes. He tells them how happy he has ever been in the society of his brothers \u2014 he hopes that the warm friendship that has so long existed between them will be remembered through life \u2014 that it will not be long before he is lucky enough to meet"], [325, "309 OF THE DUELS AT JENA. some of them in the different ways they may have to take through the world \u2014 and concludes by breathing the same prayer for their happiness, each and all, as they have respectively ex pressed for his. Whereupon another loud \" Live well ! \" rends the air, and while this is going on, the departing Boy proceeds to quaff the contents of his can at one draught, as the others had done theirs before him. The ceremony is now almost at an end. The post-carriage, shorn of the imposing grandeur of four horses, and reduced to the frugality of two, is by this time ready waiting outside the tavern-door to conduct the out-studied student to the railway station. His brother-members of the club accompany him to the steps of the vehicle ; and there, as they cluster round him, each shakes him by the hand, and kisses him on the lips ere he takes his seat in the carriage. This done, two of his oldest friends seat themselves beside him \u2014 the door of the \" Wagen \" is then closed \u2014 another shout given \u2014 the postilion blows his bugle \u2014 and away the departing Boy is borne, far from those who still wave their hands after him, as they stand grouped about the tavern-door, wondering whether they are ever to meet in the world again. So ends this pretty httle affectionate ceremony. The other members of the club then return to the town, singing in a body as plaintively as before, and each saddened with the sense of there being the same mysterious void among their little fraternity as even the most heartless feels after a death in the house. We now come to speak of what, after all, is perhaps the principal institution among the Jena students, viz. the duelling, which goes on almost every day of the week. Such encounters are supposed to be forbidden by the senate, but if they are not directly allowed, at least they are winked at, by the college authorities. True, it is customary for the heads of the university to send out their beadles to the fighting-halls once or twice in the course of each semester ; whereupon, the whole who are taking part in the encounter leap out of window, or run off and hide themselves in the loft, or get away as best they can. But, though the beadles are occasionally sent out, and the time at which the duels are to come off is pretended to be kept secret, this is merely a matter of form ; since hardly a fight occurs between the boys but every citizen in the town (and there is not the least doubt every professor at the college also) is almost as well-informed as"], [326, "310 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to the day and hour when it is to take place, as even the members of the two conflicting societies themselves. \" Would the Herr like to see a nice duel to-day ?\" the waiters at the hotels will say to you as you eat your broiled ham in the morning. \" Very pretty affair coming off in the forenoon, sir. Two of the best fighters of the Germanians and Thuringians are going loose, and I was told by one of the Corps last night that one of them is certain to lose his nose, at least. Would the Hen- like to have a carriage to take himself and the young gentlemen over to the tavern where the fights take place ? Only a short drive, sir ; and there'll be excellent sport to-day, depend upon it. You can see it all, and get back nicely in time for dinner, sir.\" Nevertheless, though the waiters at the hotels have full in- formation on such subjects, the members of the Jena Senate pretend to have no knowledge of the matter. When they send their beadles out only those boys can be punished who are caught with the \" fighting breeches \" on, while the seconds must be taken with their embroidered aprons about their body in order to be brought within the law. If, however, the duellists can manage to remove their paddings before the beadles come up, nothing can be done to them \u2014 even though they are found with their faces covered with blood. Should they, however, be caught in fiagrante delicto, the punishment is generally six weeks' imprisonment for the one who sent the challenge, and fourteen days for him who aceepted it \u2014 the seconds being merely reprimanded and ad- monished not to mix themselves up with such matters again ; while every rapier-blade that the beadles can lay hands upon has a heavy fine put upon it (between 2?. and 31. if we remember rightly), which the club to whom it belongs has to pay. Hence, directly the approach of the beadles is announced by the scouts outside, the first thing the boys do is to collect every weapon lying about the room, while the others attend to the combatants, and either hasten to strip off their paddings, or else to carry them up to the loft, or to some other place of secresy. \u25a0 \" Suppose,\" said we, \" a boy was to be killed in a duel, what would be the punishment then ?\" \" Oh !\" replied the student, coolly, \" he would be locked up for six months, that would be all. But it's almost impossible for such a thing to happen now-a-days, for every mortal part is so thoroughly protected with bandages that no serious accident can occur.\" But, notwithstanding the Senate deals thus lightly with the"], [327, "OF THE DUELS AT JENA. 311 boy-duellists, the college authorities, and even the members of the student-clubs themselves, show no mercy to au}7 one striking another in the face with his hands ; for though the university lads are at liberty to slit each other's faces half open, and, in deed, to slice off the tips of then brother students' noses, if any boy is hasty enough to give another even so much as a box on the ear, he is immediately expelled, not only from the college but from his own club also, with every indignity, and unable to enter any other German university ! The present mode of fighting in Jena is what is termed schlagen, that is to say, striking, while the weapons they use are called Schldger (striking swords |, in opposition to rapiers, which are, literally speaking, thrusting weapons. A few years ago, what is termed the Pariser Stossen (or French mode of thrusting at the body with small swords) used to prevail. But this was found so dangerous, and proved fatal in so many cases, that it has been almost entirely laid aside for the less perilous Schldger fights. In the olden time, it was also customary to fight with krumme Sabeln (crooked sabres) fashioned like the heavy swords of the cavalry. But this proved also to be such dangerous work \u2014 the weighty blades often cutting through the skull, and many a time carrying away the greater part of a man's cheek \u2014 that it has been laid aside of late. Meetings with pistols, on the other hand, occasionally, though but rarely, take place. We heard of none in Jena ; but during our stay in Eisenach, a young German baron, who was studying at the Forest-School, picked a quarrel with one of the officers in the army while they were hob-a-nob bing at one of the common beer-houses of the town. The Deutsch nobleman challenged the officer to meet him with pistols on the morrow ; and then the usual pot-valiant farce was enacted, for the nine hundred and ninety-ninth time \u2014 the offended one firing as wide as possible at his antagonist, so as to avoid hitting him, and the offender discharging his pistol at the branches of a tree ; whereupon the wounded honour of both the tom-noddies was declared to have been duly salved and healed, and they returned home, each pluming himself on his bravery upon the occasion. The reason of the duels occurring almost daily among the Jena boys will be readily understood by any one who will take the trouble to refer to section 3 of the before-given laws of the Arminian club ; for there it will be seen that the boys bind themselves to combat, by word and deed, with every union"], [328, "312 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. opposed to the aim and objects of their own guilds \u2014 especially, say the laws \" with the so-called Husbandmen and Corps, who are the type of a base and unpatriotic life among students.\" Of course, when such feelings prevail among young men at the out set of their student-career, and the lads are sworn to carry out the principles which bind them together, no great amount of brotherly love can exist among the members of the different university societies. Certain it is, however, that the boys of the same club are never allowed to quarrel with one another ; for before they are admitted into the select circle, their habits and tempers are tested by a six months' probation, and even after that, if any words were to occur between the brother members of the same society, the heads of the union would be sure to arrange the dispute in an amicable manner. In the heat of their cups, however, it is impossible to say what may not happen ; but even then, let the boys be as inflamed by liquor as they may, they know that the rules of their society allow them to call any one whom they may fancy to have offended them only a \" Bapier junge,\" that is to say, a novice in duelling \u2014 a challenge which renders it necessary for the boy using the words to go through the form of a sham duel with the other at the fencing-loft ; when they are both provided with thick felt caps and wire masks to protect them, the rule being that he who gets the most cuts over the head in a given time has to pay for a barrel of beer to the society. At the time when we gave our feast to the Arminians, the young American before spoken of called the whole of the members Bapier-jungen, and how many barrels of beer he had to pay for his rashness it is difficult to recount. Moreover, each society is, as it were, the guardian of the honour of every one of its members ; and if any one of their body hesitates to accept a challenge, or does not behave himself in a brave and honourable manner whUe fighting a duel, he is dismissed with ignominy from the club. A case of this kind came under our own personal observation. A lad, whom we had known at Eisenach, while he was a scholar at the Real-Gymna sium, went afterwards to finish his studies at the Saxon Univer sity. At the commencement of his college- career he was a member of one of the student-clubs ; but getting involved in a noise, his first duel had soon to come off. At this, however, he fought so timidly and awkwardly, that in the midst of the en counter he gave his adversary a blow which even the most skilful could not possibly have expected, and which had the effect of"], [329, "313 OF HIE DUELS AT JENA. laying his ribs open. Whereupon the youth was tried by the members of his club, for unmanly conduct ; and we saw the lad, whom but a few weeks before we had noted in Eisenach in his bright-coloured cerevise-cap, wearing the black \" Miitze \" of the Finches during our stay in Jena, as a sign that he belonged to no club whatever. As a rule, the grand enmity exists between the members of the boy-guilds and the corps The \" Finches,\" or those who belong to no club, are allowed to go free by the others, as persons utterly unworthy of their notice. The corps, we have before explained, comprise the more aristocratic portion of the students ; while the student-clubs or boy-guilds \u2014 as we have called the Burschenschaft \u2014 consist principally of those lads who have more democratic, or, as they style it, more patriotic ideas. But though the members of the student-clubs may occasionally fraternize, as a rule those belonging to one society never speak with another. During the time that we were in Jena, the Arminian club was on friendly terms with the Germanians, and therefore the members of the one body could not fight with those of the other, unless in some extraordinary case ; whereas with the Teutons the Armi nians held no converse whatever, for they were in Pauck-verschiss (duel-excommunication), and the Arminians would not allow any one of their society to accept a challenge from them ; for we were told that these same Teutons had behaved in some dis honourable manner in connection with a late duel, and therefore the Arminians had refused to notice the others in any way, until the matter was cleared up. Hence, the members of the Armi nian club had only the corps left to quarrel and fight with ; and during our stay in Jena the duels which came off were merely with them. Every Fox, or young student, is bound to learn fencing \u2014 the course consisting of twenty lessons, and there being a fencing master kept especially for such a purpose. For the course of lessons the Fox has to pay from som- to five thalers (12s. to 15s.); and even when he is considered to be a proficient in the art, he must contribute three shillings each half-year towards the rent of the fencing-loft and the support of the fencing-master, \u2014 the in come of such fencing-master being greater than that of the head professor at the university itself. Moreover, each student in con nection with an}' of the clubs or corps, is expected to provide himself with a fencing-hat and mask, and with fencing-gloves and rapier, the cost of the fighting outfit being from four to five"], [330, "314 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. thalers also (12s. to Ios.). Further, in the course of practice at the aforesaid fencing-loft, the blades are continually being broken, and these cost twenty groschens apiece ; and our young American friend assured us that he had given out a matter of four shillings in one week solely for such articles. Every member of a club or corps, is bound by the rules of his society to attend this fencing loft for one or two hours in the course of each day, so as to practise continually, in order to be ready to meet any challenge he may receive. The fencing-loft itself is a bare building in one of the bye-streets of Jena, and immediately adjoining the laboratory of the coUege. Long before you reach the place you hear the clink of the clashing swords ; and this goes on through the entire day. The windows are all wired, like those of a tennis-court, to prevent the panes being broken by the springing blades. Inside, the rooms are like malting-floors or corn-stores, being utterly destitute of furniture, and with merely lockers ranged round the walls. Here the boys keep their fencing-hats, with wire-masks attached, their old coats, their swords, and their fighting-gloves, all of which are fastened together by a chain, and duly padlocked against the wall. At the time of our visit we counted upwards of one hundred of these fighting accoutrements, and that on one floor only. Those who have seen the diver at the Polytechnic Institution have only to imagine that some half-dozen couple of such ugly-looking monsters are lashing one another at the same time with the swords that are not so broad, and almost as phant, as penny canes, and they will understand almost as well as we do what goes on upon such occasions. The boys keep an infinity of old rags with which to bind up their arms, so as to protect them from the sting of the blows ; for they belabour one another as earnestly as if they were fighting for dear life, and such hard work is it that after every five minutes they have to remove their hat and mask in order to get a breath of air. In the midst of the practising, one of the fencers cries aloud, \"Halt, I've caught one over the breast! \" and then, making a wry face, he adds, as he stamps about, \"Thundering weather! but that does hurt.\" Whereupon he opens the bosom of his shirt, and there is seen a long red wheal right across the breast. \" I didn't mean to strike so low, Walter,\" exclaims the other, \" but, you see, I was afraid of cutting you in the face.\" \"Oh, no, never mind,\" returns the injured one, still biting his lip ; \"but we must wait a while till the pain is over.\""], [331, "OF THE DUELS AT JENA. 315 In the meantime, maybe, the unscathed boy calls one of the young hands to him, and says, \"Now let's see what you could do if you were going loose. One \u2014 two \u2014 three ! one \u2014 two \u2014 three ! Prim! Second! steile Terz! ties Terz! steile Quart! ties Quart!\" he cries, as he exemplifies each of the cuts to the young Fox, adding, as he gives the last blow, \"There, you see, you'd have had your cheek cut in two ! \" The blow, however, feU upon the throat of the young fellow, and set him coughing and trying to spit blood for the next two or three minutes. \" It was only with the flat edge of the blade that I struck him,\" explains the other to us. Every boy has, as a rule, from four to five challenges on hand, and it is the duty of the \"weapon-guardians\" of the one club to arrange with the \"weapon-guardians\" of the others when the en- counters are to come off. At the Burg-keller there was a small room adjoining the drinking-hall, where the weapons of the club were kept, and to the mysteries of which w-e were duly inducted during our stay in the university-town. These weapons, which are far more expensive articles than those used at practising, are duly sharpened on the occasion of a duel, and sent out in a bag to the fighting-hall in the suburbs, together with the silk masonic- like apron (on which is embroidered the monogram of the club), which the seconds invariably wear at such times. So far from the students objecting to such encounters, they seemed to us to be ambitious of having their faces tattooed in the same manner as a Red Indian, as a sign of their bravery during their student-life ; and as a general matter, it may be said that each boy connected with a student-club or corps fights one duel every half-year during his stay in Jena. One club, consisting of thirty members, we were told as a great thing, had fought a hundred duels in one half-year ; and the young doctor before referred to had had from fourteen to seventeen duels (he could not tell us the exact number) during his stay at the university. Others said there was not an artery in his head or face that had not been cut in two, although he was one of the most experienced fighters at the college ; and to look at him, his face was like a bit of scored pork. If a boy is challenged before he knows how to fight, he is allowed from four to six weeks to make himself acquainted with the art. During our residence in the university-town, a little fellow, not bigger than an English drummer, who was the nephew"], [332, "316 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of one of the professors, was called upon to go out ; and it was pleasant then to note the fatherly care of the other boys concern ing the smallest member of their society. \" Oh,\" said they, \"he shall be led off (abgefuhrt) at the first heavy blow!\" However, in the morning there came a message from his uncle, who was the professor of natural philosophy at the university, that he was forbidden to take part in any duel. Another rule with the members of these societies is, that no one can be allowed to par ticipate in an encounter while the plaisters, covering the wounds of a previous duel, are still on his face. Daring our stay in Jena an incident occurred which will give the reader a good sense of the feeling which exists between the boys of the several German universities. One of the Jena students had fought a duel with a boy whose face, in the words of our informant, he had cut to shreds. After that, the boy had gone to Heidelberg, when the students, hearing how severely he had been treated by one of the Jena lads, sent their best swords man over to the Saxon university to challenge the offender ; and the encounter ended in the Heidelberg boy cutting the Jena student's nose literally in two. Indeed, during the whole of our time in the town he was confined to his bed, being obliged to have fresh ice put every hour to his olfactory organ ; and we saw him, only on the last day that we were in the city, with his nose strapped-up. The time and place of the duels are arranged by the weapon guardians of each club. Immediately a boy has challenged another, he has to give in the name of himself and his ad versary to the aforesaid officer of the society, who enters the two in a book, and arranges with the weapon-guardians of the other clubs when the encounters are to come off. We ourselves waited in Jena ten days before such an affray took place, although we were assured, before going there, they were of daily occurrence. True, we heard, in the meantime, of many such an encounter between the corps ; but, said the Ar minians to us, \" That is poor work, for they fight with their caps on ; and as you have come over here to see a true German duel, it is better that you should remain until one of us and the corps go loose, when no such child's play is allowed ; for then you will have some idea of what such an affair is hke.\" Accordingly, we bided our time. At length the Arminian boys told us that everything was arranged for the morrow ; and we should here state, so as not to interfere with the current of the"], [333, "317 OF THE DUELS AT JENA. narrative, that, at the time of such duels, peasants are hired to stand on the hills and act as \" telegraphs,\" as they are called, so as to signal when the university beadles are coming ; that the boys always make it all right with the ferry-man across the Saale to take as long a time as possible in carrying the beadles over the river ; and that, indeed, every obstruction is offered to their progress. As an instance of the peculiar feelings these duelling institu tions beget, even among strangers to the country, we will cite a little anecdote that was related to us in the course of our stay in Jena. Two Americans who were alike studying at the college, but who belonged to different societies, happened to meet at one of the commerce-evenings before spoken of. \" You're an Ameri can, I hear,\" said the one to the other, the latter being the young Jena student whose letter we have quoted. \" That's right, I guess,\" returned our friend. \" From what State?\" inquired the first speaker. \" I'm from Indiana,\" answered the second. \"Well, I'm from Carolina,\" added the other, \" and you're a dummer Junge ! \" Whereupon, according to the customs of the Jena boys, the Northener and the Southener had to slit one another's face open in order to wipe away the insult."], [334, "CHAPTER XXV. THREE FIGHTS IN JENA, At many of the German university-towns, such as Heidelberg and Bonn, you are iu the habit of passing boys in the street minus one ear. Such deformities, however, are seldom met with at the Saxon \" seat of learning,\" owing to the precautions which will be hereafter mentioned. It is customary with the students who are about to fight to ride out to the place of meeting in a Spritze, or one-horse chaise, and it is generally so arranged that as many duels as possible may come off on the same day. Others walk out, as we did, across the meadows, on the other side of the Saale river ; and it was curious to see how the path over the fields was dotted over with the long procession of pedestrians on that day, as if they were so many village geese returning to then- homes in the evening. True, but few of the Jena citizens think it worth their while to stir over their doorstep to see such matters. Nevertheless, all the friends of the boys who are about to fight make a point of attending, and the entire members of the club are bound to be present. So that, as there were no less than four societies about to \" let loose,\" as the phrase runs, on the day to which we refer, the narrow path across the marshes was studded with the long file of persons who were anxious to witness the affray. The usual fighting-place is a small roadside inn, situate in the suburbs of the college city, and about half an hour's walk from the town. Each of the combatants has to pay the landlord of the inn five groschens for the u^e of the fighting-room ; and as, on the occasion to which we allude, no less thm six couples \" went loose,\" it will be seen that the landlord, for a German one, did not drive so bad a trade. When we reached Wollnitz, we found a party of \" Finks \" in"], [335, "319 THREE FIGHTS IN JENA. their black caps, and a good assembly of peasants seated under the broad-spreading branches of the linden-tree in front of the inn, the ground beneath which was boarded over, so as to form an alfresco dancing-floor for the boors and booresses of the neigh bourhood. Indeed, the tavern at Wbllnitz is one of those suburban hostel ries which abound in the neighbourhood of every German city, and whither the servant-maids of the town delight to resort and waltz with their sweethearts every Sunday evening ; the Jena boys taking pride in telling you that the stains of the blood which is spilt on the Saturday (for that is the favourite day for duels, owing to there being no lectures in the afternoon at the end of the week) are danced out of the boards by the peasants and serving-maids on the Sunday. While we were seated under the shade of the huge tree in front of the Wbllnitz inn, the young Arminian doctor, of whom we have before spoketi, and who had to act as the surgeon at all their duels, sauntered up and seated himself next to us ; and no sooner had he ordered his can of beer than he drew forth the case of instruments with which he had come provided, eager to let us, as strangers, see what was necessary on such occasions. Then, as he opened the pocket-book-like apparatus, he showed us, with no little pride, the silver boothook-like instrument which he said they used for taking up any arteries that might be divided in the course of the encounter, as well as the nippers which were required to clip together the ends of the blood-vessels, so as to prevent them pulsing forth more blood than the boy could afford to lose. After this he drew forth the short, bent needles, each ready threaded with a piece of bright-coloured silk, that were used to sew up any severe wound that might be inflicted. These needles had thick, triangular-shaped shanks, and were bent into a semi-circular form, so that with the threads attached to them, they seemed more like clumsy fishing-hooks than any surgical instrument. Next he took out of his coat-tail pockets a bottle of collodion, with a camel's-hair brush fastened to the capped stopper, after the manner of the patent gum-bottles of our own country ; and drawing forth at the same time, a few strips of linen, he said that he found them when brushed over with the solution of gun cotton, the best-possible plaister that could be used on such occa sions. Then those who were grouped about us began to tell stories of celebrated encounters, \u2014 one narrating how a boy had had the end"], [336, "320 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of his nose cut off, and the dog of the club had eaten it up before the surgeon could pick it off the floor and put it in his mouth, according to the usual custom, to keep it warm till he could sew it on. We should here remark that connected with the Arminians there was a fine intelligent black hound of the name of \" Tell,\" who would follow none but the members of the club or their friends, and who struck us as being the counterpart of the fire men's dog in London. We noted him even at Wollnitz, as if he knew instinctively that something was \"loose,\" as the Germans sav. Thus the time passed in listening to celebrated duels that had occurred in that town, some telling us how, in the encounter which is represented in the frontispiece of this book, young Steiben, who is now a lieutenant in the Saxe-Weimarish army, and who was one of the principals in the affray (an affray between the Franks, of which Steiben was one of the principal fighters, and the Thuringians, with the Saxons \u2014 a crefuMbfr- \u00abwrps \u2014 for umpire), cut out the eye of his antagonist so clean, that\"j>lay hke a boy's marble on the floor, and that since that time the regula- tion had been come to that the duellists shall, one and all, wear eye-guards when engaged in their encounters with small swords. \" There'll be fine work to-day,\" says one. \" They are going at it on both floors \u2014 the Franks and the Teutons on the basement, while our boys and the Westphalians have got the first-floor all to themselves. But do you come up and see the rooms now that the place is empty.\" Following our student-guide, we found the fighting-hall to con- sist of a small, square, and bare apartment, which was about the size of a London police-court, with a tiny raised stage at one end of it, that was meant for the orchestra when it was used for a dancing-hall, and to which purpose it was, as we have said, applied almost every Sabbath evening. Indeed, the duelling- room was nearly similar in all its arrangements to that which is represented in our frontispiece \u2014 with the exception that it was a few paces smaller ; for the scene of the encounter represented at the beginning of this book was in the neighbourhood of the Oil- Mill, where the dancing-rooms are somewhat larger. With this slight difference, however, the room, the fittings, and the furni- ture, depicted in the frontispiece, will stand well enough for the Wollnitz fighting hall. The only point peculiar about the place was the marks of blood upon the ceiling, which was sprinkled all over with red spots, as"], [337, "321 THREE FIGHTS IN JENA. if it had been \" marbled \" with the gouttes thrown off from the tips of the blades ; wliile the floor itself was blackened at either end with the remains of the stains of the different encounters that had taken place within it. Next, our young Arminian friends, who were delighted to initiate us into the whole of the duelling mysteries, escorted us into another room at the opposite side of the passage, where they told us that the members of their club were to be bandaged pre vious to fighting, and to have their wounds dressed afterwards. Here we found a long table arranged, with basins and a stable boy's huge sponge set out upon it, while on the floor stood a large watering-pot, full of water, and in one corner an old square piano. By the time our inspection of the premises was at an end, and we had rejoined the company under the lindens, the boys cried out. \" Here they are ! \" and instantly four Spritzes dashed up to the door, each filled with the youngsters who were to fight that morning. \" Do you mark,\" said the friend next to us, \" they've all got brown-paper parcels with them. Those contain the clean shirts they have brought, in case of emergency ; for when a hoy is wounded he cannot wear the same shirt again, and it has either to be burnt or given away to the persons belonging to the inn.\" \" Now, you had better come inside,\" said one of the Armi nians, \" and we'll pick you out a nice place, where you can have a good view of the whole proceedings.\" Then, having re-entered the fighting and dancing-hall, our friend placed us at the extreme end of the orchestra, nearest the windows, saying, \" That was the best place in the room ;\" and hardly had we taken our seat before the people began to flock into the hall, and the porters made their appearance, carrying upon their back a large potato-sack, filled with the weapons and other fighting paraphernalia of the club. The Arminian boys began unpacking these at once, and drawing forth a huge leathern case, like a gigantic \" house-wife,\" in which some twenty or thirty sword-blades were thrust, after the fashion of the scissors, bodkin, <fcc, in a lady's work-case, they commenced fixing the blades into the large globular hilts. \"While this was going on, the Westphalian party, who had now entered and taken up their station at the end of the room facing the orchestra, began to make arrangements for bandaging the ri\u00abht arm of their man, who had already taken off his coat and waistcoat, and appeared in a coarse shirt for the purpose. Then 21"], [338, "322 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. two of the Arminian boys came forward and proceeded to measure off twelve feet in the middle of the room, the one supporting the other as he went staggering along with heel to toe. And when this space had been portioned out, a broad chalk line was drawn at either end of it, to mark the limits within which the duellists must keep. Next the Arminians proceeded to flourish the mono grammatic device of their club in large chalk letters on the boards, at that end of the room where their party was to be ranged. There was no necessity for the Westphalians to do the same on the other side ; for the device of their club was already chalked upon the floor, they having been engaged in a similar affray the day previous, and the letters being still visible enough to mark the quarters of their society. Now nothing was heard but the hammering of sword blades into their big iron hilts, and as fast as the nuts which fastened the blades into the handles had been screwed firmly on, the boys on either side began trying the fitted weapons by brandishing them in the air, until you could hear them whistle again, as they whisked them to and fro above their heads. Others pulled single hairs from out their head, and proceeded to test the sharpness of their edge as a barber does that of a razor. Aud when this pre paratory work bad been gone through, some six or eight of the small swords were placed in a row against the wall, so that in case of any blade springing in the course of the fight another implement might be ready for immediate use. Our attention, however, was engrossed in watching the ban daging of the Westphalian boy, which was going on at the oppo site end of the room ; for as every apartment in the inn was occupied by some one of the clubs who were to fight that day, the Westphalians were constrained to dress in public. This ban daging consisted in winding yard after yard of strips of old black silk round the long and thickly-padded cuff of the fighting gaunt let\u2014such cuff reaching right up to the shoulder (so that the entire arm in which the weapon was to be held might be pro tected from any blow), and the bandages being of silk because that is less readily cut through than any other material by the blades. And after the arm of the Westphalian had been thus bound up, an extra yard or two of the same strips of old cravats was wound round the wrist to protect that also against injury. When the operation was complete the arm had more the appear- ance of a swollen gouty leg, or a roll of brawn, than the ordinary hmb; and the weight of the swathed member was so great that"], [339, "323 THREE FIGHTS IN JENA. a friend had to stand by and support it on his shoulder while the other part of the attiring for the fight was being performed. Next a thick, padded cravat was fastened round the neck. This was not unlike the deep stock that used to be worn by the late George the Fourth, and which extended so high that the chin was almost covered by it. Then a pair of leathern spectacle frames, into which the glasses of the boy \u2014 for he was short- sighted \u2014 were fitted, and with thick iron rings to protect the eyes from any blow, was strapped round the head in such a manner that the leather at the sides might cover the ears, and thus pre- vent them from being cut off \u2014 as frequently happens at those universities where no such guard is worn. Indeed, these spectacle- frames, as we have before mentioned, are comparatively novel appliances at Jena; they were introduced only after the encounter represented in our frontispiece, and which ended, as we have said, in one of the duellists having his eye whisked out by the tip of his opponent's Schldger. The spectacle-frame being duly fitted, the friend of the one about to fight proceeded to adjust the \" fighting-trousers\" for him, such fighting-trousers being like a pair of jockey's breeches, with the entire back of the body and legs cut away, so that only the front half of the article remained. They are made of padded wash-leather, and reach from the waist down to the knees, so as to protect the entire bowels and thighs against any blow of the sharp small-sword. This part of the fighting-gear is the property of the club to which the combatant belongs, and has been used in so many pre- vious encounters, that the front of it is stained brown all over with clotted blood ; aud when we saw it strapped on to the Westpha- lian at the other end of the room, and beheld him completely accoutred for the fray, the boy looked as hideous and almost as inhuman an object as one could possibly behold. The only image, indeed, that we had ever seen like him was the diver at the Poly- technic, as he walks about with his helmet off, previous to going down into the tank. Presently, the Arminian lad was brought in, attired after the same \u00abrim fashion, and with his bandaged arm stretched out at full length, and supported on the shoulder of some member of his club. The seconds, got up in their bright-coloured, masonic like aprons, embroidered with the monogram of their respective clubs and each wearing a padded gauntlet and a cap with a long projecting peak, so as to protect their arm and face against any stray blow \u2014 also made their appearance at the same time."], [340, "324 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. It was curious now to see the two boys, who were about to slash and gash each other's faces, look at one another from the opposite ends of the room. One would have fancied that only the hottest and fiercest passions would have been depicted in their countenance ; but not the least sign of enmity was displayed by either of them. Indeed, it was clear that the silly lads were about to spill each other's blood merely for the \" honour\" of the thing, as if blood-shedding was the noblest act in the world ; and they would as readily have fought with a tailor's dummy, if there had been any honour in that \u2014 so little malice did they bear one another The Westphalian \" boy\" was a podgy little dark man, of some three or four and twenty years of age, with a bullet-head, and short-cut, scrubbing-brushlike hair, and with a pah of eyes so intensely black that they were like those of a terrier rather than a human being. The Arminian lad, on the other hand, was a fair-complexioned and good-looking youth, who seemed to be some five or six years younger than his antagonist. Still, he was somewhat taller than the Westphalian, but hardly slimmer in his build. Then the seconds, and those who were supporting the arms of the bandaged men, led them each up to the mark drawn on the floor at the opposite ends of the room, while others of their friends proceeded to chalk the palms of their gloves, and then gave them a weapon to try ; and with this they set about cutting the air, so as to see whether the weight and the working of it suited them. Then a handkerchief was passed over the lowest strap at the back of the fighting-breeches, and being tied there, the ends were given to the \"boy\" to lay hold of, so that he might thus keep his unbandaged arm securely behind him \u2014 out of the way of all stray blows. All being now ready for the encounter, the coloured caps of the two combatants were placed on their heads, and the seconds took their places, each with his sword in his hand, beside his man, while the umpire (chosen by the challenger) came forward aud stationed himself in the middle of one side of the room, holding his watch in his palm. Whereupon the one seconding the Westphalian says, \" Un parteiischer! bitte um Silentium fur Gang Schldger mit Miitzen und Sekondanten.\" (Umpire ! I beg for silence for a Schldger bout, with caps and seconds.) The reason of the words \"caps and seconds\" being used is, that in case of any accident occurring, the umpire can declare to"], [341, "THREE FIGHTS IN JENA. 325 the university-authorities that the duel was given out as being of such a character, \u2014 this mode of fighting being less dangerous, and therefore less heavily punished, than duels of other kinds ; the caps acting, of course, as a certain protection to the skull, whilst the seconds in the olden time had the right of warding off any of the more serious blows levelled at their man. But though this custom on the part of the seconds has now ceased, and their duty is at present limited merely to knocking up the swords of the assailants after the word \" Halt ! \" has been called, never theless, a duel with such seconds is regarded by the College Senate as being of a less serious character than any other. Then the umpire cries aloud, \" I beg silence for a Schldger bout with caps and seconds,\" and immediately afterwards not a word is heard in the room. Then the second of the challenger says to the umpire once more, \" Vn-parteiischer ! bitte urn's Commando\" (Umpire, I beg for the command). Whereupon the umpire exclaims, \" Aus die Mensur!\" (To the measure or duel!); and no sooner are the words uttered than the second of the challenger cries, \" Bindet die Elingen!\" (Join the blades!) whereupon the second of the one who has been challenged calls aloud in answer, \" Gebunden sind!\" (They are bound!) and as these words are spoken, the combatants and seconds all stand with their swords raised and stretched out, so that the tips of the four blades meet in the middle of the room, waiting for the command \"Loos!\" (i.e. Let loose!) to be given; and immediately this is pronounced, the seconds draw back a step or two, while the principals prepare either to strike or guard, as the case may be. But before there is time for either to give a blow, a cry of \" Halt ! \" is raised by the two seconds, and the coloured caps are then removed from the heads of the duellists. After which, the same command to \" Bind the weapons !\" once more is given, the same answer returned, that \" They are bound ! \" followed by the same cry of \"Loos!\" and immediately after this the two as- sailants fall to striking one another, till the blades whistle in the air like whip-cord, and the blows fall on the bandaged arm of either so thick and fast, that the place sounds like a barracks where the soldiers are busy beating the jackets with canes ; and the seconds keep dodging about watching the men, and with their swords ready to arrest the blade of each adversary at the shortest notice. By this time the open doorway, and the passages without, were crammed with spectators (for there was not the least attempt"], [342, "326 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to make the exhibition in any way a private one), boys even of eight and ten years old being allowed to come in and witness the performance, some of the spectators standing on chairs, so as to be able to look over the heads of those in front of them, and others perched up the staircase, and leaning over the balusters. Peasants and students, publicans, butchers \u2014 people of all kinds, indeed \u2014 were there, each with a wooden can of beer in his hand, aud almost all with pipes or cigars in their mouths. Indeed, this smoking was so general, that the Westphalian second him self indulged in it throughout the duel. If the duellists are both equally-expert fighters, so that neither receives a wound immediately, and the blades are of good stuff, the fighting goes on uninterruptedly for thirty seconds, or a minute maybe, without any cry of \" Halt ! \" to stay it for a time. On the occasion to which we allude, the first bout lasted rather longer than usual, and after a minute and a half perhaps had expired, and each had been lashing the other all that time, as if he were horse-whipping him rather than attacking him with a sword, there was a call of \" Halt !\" owing to one of the weapons having become bent in the encounter, and a blow from such a crooked blade being far more dangerous than any other ; so the minute either of the duellists or the umpire perceives that such an accident has happened, the command to stop is given by them, and both of the seconds rush in with their swords raised, so as to prevent another blow being struck after that. i None but the persons fighting or the umpire are allowed to cry \u2022\u2022 Halt ! \" and as some one in the room had done this first, the Westphalian second appealed to the umpire, and begged he \u25a0would maintain silence for the Schldger-boxxt. During the pause the blade is either straightened or a fresh weapon brought forth, and as this is going on, the friends of each of the duellists advance and chalk the palms of their gloves once more, while others give them a sip of beer \u2014 for even though the first bout had lasted but little more than a minute, both the opponents stood puffiing and blowing as if utterly exhausted with the labour, and with the perspiration streaming down their faces, till the blacking from the leather of the thick padded stock about their neck was dissolved by it, so that their cheeks came to be grimed with it as black as sweeps', aud they looked more hideous than before. \"They fight well, both of them,\" said one of the Arminians near us. \" It's as good a match as I've ever seen.\" When all was arranged once more, the command was given, as"], [343, "THREE FIGHTS IN JENA. 327 previously, to \"Join the weapons;\" and no sooner had the words \" Let loose ! \" been repeated, than the two silly young men went at it again, belabouring one another as hard as they could, after the fashion of some drunken costermonger pounding away at the hide of his donkey. . So auother minute passed; and then another cry of \"Halt!\" was raised by the Westphalian boy, and instantly the doctor of the society, who was waiting in attendance at the table behind, together with the other members of the club, grouped about their man. \" He's got it,\" said an Arminian lad next to us ; \"1 thought our boy would give it him, though the other fights as prettily as here and there one.\" Then we could see the leathern spectacle-frame removed from the head of the Westphalian, and the doctor examining his eye. \" Do you understand what's the matter?\" asked our Arminian friend; \"he's been fighting with his own spectacle-glasses fitted into the frame, and our man has smashed one of them for him. Had it not been for the guard he'd have had his eye cut out ss sure as death. Pretty slash, that, indeed ! \" When the doctor had assured himself that none of the chips of the glass were sticking in the eye of the Westphalian boy, the head-gear was re-arranged, and hard at it they went once more. After a few seconds, however, another cry of \"Halt!\" was heard. One of the swords was broken. \" There goes a thaler ten,\" whispered our friend ; \" we always lose some two or three of those blades every time our boys come out to fight.\" The fatigue of the two combatants (though but little more than three minutes had elapsed) now appeared to be so overpowering, that we fancied that neither would be able to fight-out the ap pointed time ; for, though the weather was by no means sultry, it was evident the bandages and paddings were so stifling that each seemed as \" blown,\" and in the same state of profuse per spiration, as a racehorse after a three-mile heat. And thus the affray proceeded, with a short stoppage at almost every thirty or forty seconds, for some reason or other, until seven and a half minutes had elapsed, whereupon the umpire cried, \"Silentium! 7 J Minuten ist gepaukt\" (Silence! seven and a half minutes have been fought); adding, \"Die Corona magen wdhrend der Pause abtreten\" (The spectators can retire during the pause)."], [344, "328 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Then the members of each of the clubs proceed to congratulate their boy upon having fought through the half of the appointed time without getting so much as a scratch from the other. \" Thundering weather ! \" we heard one of the Arminians say ; \"but thou art fighting delightfully to-day, Thick One. But thou'lt give it him yet, / know thee ; and I shouldn't wonder if thou slit'st his tongue in two before thou'st done with him.\" \" But come,\" said the young student to us, \" the room is close, and they want air ; and the Franks and the Teutons are at work down below.\" So, leaving the combatants to have their faces washed, and to be refreshed with beer during the pause (which lasts for five minutes), we withdrew to the ground-floor of the fighting and dancing establishment, to see what was going on there But here we found such a crowd gathered round the door of the fighting and dancing hall, that it was impossible, not only to i55ter, but to see even so much as the tips of the steel blades flashing in the air ; though we could hear them clicking away as if it had been a stone-breaking yard, and the same cry of \" Halt !\" shrieked out a few seconds afterwards, but for what reason we could never learn nor discover ; for the landlord of the inn stood close against the door, with a huge watering pot full of beer, filling the wooden cans of those who were eager for the washy refreshment. Accordingly, we retired to the open air, so as to get a mouthful of the fresh atmosphere without : and here we found a crowd of yellow-haired and blue-smocked village boys perched on top of the palings round about the inn, and craning their necks forward, so as to have a peep through the windows, while they said to one another, \" Dormer schock !\" (Sixty claps of thunder ! the favourite exclamation with the German boors) \" but the Frank got a bloody one (ein Blutiger) over the forehead then ! \" Before the five minutes' pause was up, we returned to the fighting and dancing hall on the first floor of that elegant esta- blishment, so as to be able to keep the orchestra-stalls which we had occupied at the former part of the entertainment. There was still time to speak a few words with the Arminian boy, who was seated at the table, with his stock off, and his heavily-ban- daged arm resting on the edge of it. He told us that his adversary fought well, but still he thought he would give him a \"deep fourth \" over the cheek before he had finished with him, adding that no one who had never worn"], [345, "329 THREE FIGHTS IN JENA. the fighting-gear could imagine what hard work it was, or how the bandaged arm ajhed long before the fifteen minutes were fought-out. At the end of the pause, the umpire, seconds, and spectators all returned to the room as before, and, the umpire having once more cried, \" Silentium ! die Suite, geht welter \" (the duel pro ceeds further), the two lads let loose again at each other, both seeming more determined than ever to mark their opponent. But, though each of them hit well, they both guarded as well ; and so, with the same cries of \"Halt!\" directly either blade became crooked or broken, and the same brief stoppage until the defect was remedied, they fought-out the second seven and a half minutes without either giving the other so much as a scratch \u2014 a feat which but rarely occurs ; and so tired did they become to wards the close of the appointed time that at each halting they kept privately asking their friends about them how many minutes they had fought-out now. At the end of the fifteen minutes, the umpire cried, Silentium! 15 minuten ist gepaukt \" (the fifteen minutes have been fought out). \" Der Suite ist ex\" (the duel is at an end). And then the two were led off by their friends to undress and give their bandages and fighting-trousers over to the next couple. While the succeeding pair were getting ready, the crowd went below once more, and there you heard at the door how one of the boys had had an artery cut through, and had been obliged to be led off. You also learned during this interval the several laws of honour, as they are called, customary on such occasions, and how the combatants can say, if they please, after fighting for ten minutes (but not before),- \u2014 \"Ich biete Ihnen Satisfaction V (I ask you whether you have had satisfaction ?) To which, if the other replies \" Angenommen\" (Accepted), the duel is also pro nounced to be \" ex.\" Further, you are informed, if either is so wounded that he is blinded by the blood streaming into his eyes, or if the doctor pronounces the cut to be too dangerous for his man to proceed, then the umpire declares in like manner the affray to be finished, and the wounded lad is, as it is called, \" abgefuhrt \" led (off) to have the gash dressed. In about ten minutes after the first fight, another couple of lads were ready, \" got up \" for the next encounter ; while the Arminiaus about us said, \" Now you'll see some bloody work.''"], [346, "330 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. These two youths could not have been more than eighteen years old each; and directly the order to \"Let loose!\" was given, blood was drawn in the very first bout. Immediately the wound was felt, the one receiving it cried \"Halt!\" and the doctor came forward and examined the gash. It consisted of a long slash, across the cheek of the Westphalian boy, which seemed at first like the wheal left by the stroke of a whipcord lash. In a few seconds the blood began to flow from it in long crimson lines, trickling down the side of the boy's face, and dripping into his stock and shirt until they were nearly saturated with it. The doctor, however, bathed the wound with the stable sponge, and pronounced it of no moment. \" I knew our boy would give it him finely,\" said the Arminian at our elbow. \" He deserves all he'll get, for he thrashed a Fink the other day with a stick \u2014 the coward ! \u2014 and he will have to leave the university for that directly the matter is brought before the senate.\" (To say the truth, this Westphalian lad did not seem to be the most pleasant-natured youth in the world.) \" Our boy,\" continued the gossiping Arminian, \" knows how to give the deep fourth cut beautifully, and you'll see he'll make a beef-steak of the other's face before the fifteen minutes are over.\" In another second, the blades of the two lads were whistling in the air once more ; but in less than a minute after, the cry of \" Halt!\" was again raised, and the Arminians round about us said exultingly to one another, \" He's got it nicely this time, just over the eyebrow! It's as pretty a cut as ever. I saw in my life !\" \u2014 and the words were hardly uttered before the blood came streaming forth, running down the wounded man's nose, and trickling on to his shirt until the front of it was nearly as red as a sailor's flannel one. Despite this, after the wound had been once more inspected and washed as before, orders were given for the two to go \" loose\" again ; and then, after another minute's slashing, the West phalian received a third wound from the Arminian, the tip of whose blade was now like a bit of crimson tinsel-foil with the gore of the other. And so it went on every other minute\u2014 a fresh gash and a fresh stoppage ; until the Westphalian's boy's face seemed posi tively as red as a skinned sheep's-head, and ou the floor where he stood there was a pool of blood as if a pig had just been slaughtered on the spot, and which rendered it difficult for the"], [347, "331 THREE FIGHTS IN JENA. wounded man as he stood in it to prevent slipping about while he fought. Still the boys fought on ; even though the lads about us said the Westphalian would want no end of needles to sew up his hide \u2014 for it is the custom with the students to speak of the wounds inflicted as being so many needles long, according to the number of bits of silk that are required to be inserted in order to draw the flesh together. Despite this hacking of the Westphalian's face by the Arminian boy (every one of whose deep \"fourth \"cuts told with fearful force on the cheeks of his adversary), the two continued fighting for the full quarter of an hour. Nor would the wounded man ask the other if he had had his satisfaction at the end of the customary ten minutes. And while the fight went on, the Armi nians round about us were wondering how the other could lose so much blood without being led off \u2014 an event which they seemed to look forward to with the highest pride. Nor were they the less delighted with the idea that their boy, although he had cut the Westphalian's face almost to mince-meat,had not so much as a scratch upon his own. After this came the third and last pair of boys to have their faces hacked about in a similar manner. It is idle now to continue the disgusting details of such silly and barbarous affrays. Suffice it that this Arminian boy fought left-handed, which, of course, was a great disadvantage to his antagonist. Nevertheless, both suffered alike in the contest, several heavy blows being given on both sides, and the Arminian receiving, towards the end of the encounter, a cut on his nose that nearly divided the nostrils. Still, they both kept on to the end of the appointed quarter of an hour. At the end of the \"entertainment\" the other Arminians took us into the room appropriated to the dressing of their boys' wounds, and there we found the lad who had taken part in the last encounter, perched on a stool, and in front of him the doctor, with one of those ugly crooked needles in one hand, and the tip of the poor lad's slit nose in the other, as he proceeded to drive the triangular instrument slowly through the flesh \u2014 while the wounded youth did not so much as wink his eyes with the pain of the not-particularly-dexterous operation. As this was going on, another student sat at the piano before-mentioned, and played"], [348, "332 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. on the old cracked instrument Weber's \" Invitation to the Dance.\" The nose of the boy having been duly sewn up, the doctor pro ceeded to dress the tip of it with strips of linen, and then to brush them over with the collodion of which we have before spoken \u2014 an operation which brought the tears into the lad's eyes, owing to the biting of the ether into the raw flesh of the wound. While this was going on, one of the Westphalian boys came to the door to know how many cuts and of how many needles lone the Arminians had received in the course of the day ; all of which details these stupid boys think it worth while to record in a book kept by each of the clubs. And while the Arminian doctor was dressing the wounds of his patient, he begged of us to stand round, or else to keep the door shut, so as to prevent the people outside seeing the damage that their man had received."], [349, "CHAPTER XXVI ANCIENT RELIGION OF THURINGIA. To comprehend the old Easter-customs iii Eisenach, it is neces sary that the reader should first be informed as to what was the character of the belief and worship among the Thuringian pea sants in the Middle Ages ; for the local historians tell us that many heathen existed round about Eisenach, and remained un converted to Christianity even down to the end of the fifteenth century. Well : the primitive religion of almost every country is the adoration of the principle of Time, as being the element out of which all things proceed, and in which they have their being. \"To Time, the one prime Creator,\" the ancient people painted on their altars. \" The great Omnipresent ' I am,' \" said the pagan priests, \" for-ever chronicling the irrevooable re cords OF the past, and ordaining the inevitable destinies OF THE FUTURE.\" In ancient Thuringia the chronic principle of nature was wor shipped under the name of the god \" Sater,\" the day at the end of the week, which we still term Saturday, being the one specially consecrated to that deity, as Wednesday \u2014 the \"dies Mercurii\" of the Romans, and Mercredi of the French \u2014 was originally Wode nes-day, or that devoted to Woden (the Saxon equivalent of the Latin Mercury) ; Thursday \u2014 dies Jovis, or Jeudi \u2014 that given to Thor (the same as the Roman Jupiter); Friday \u2014 dies Veneris, or Vendredi \u2014 to Freia (the Venus of the north), &c. This Sater, who was the Saxon equivalent of the Roman Saturn \u2014 the father of all the pagan deities \u2014 Sharon Turner tells us, in his Saxon History, was the chrono-mythic deity, adored by the lower Germanic tribes under the name of Crodus, which is obvi ously a corruption of the Greek term Xpovos. An account of the"], [350, "334 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. figure of the ancient Saxon idol is preserved in one of the Bruns- wick chronicles It is said to have been that of au old man, clothed in a white tunic, with a linen girdle that had floating ends. The same old man was called by the Thuringians Eckart or Eckhardt, and was regarded as the guardian of the day and night, who sat for ever by the cleft in the lock on the Htirsel- berg. she head of the Saxon idol, we are told, was uncovered; his right hand held a vessel full of roses and other flowers swim- ming in water (as typical of the plants brought into existence by the rains of summer) ; his left hand supported the wheel of a car (indicative of the revolutions of the seasons); and his naked feet stood on a rough scaly fish, like a perch ( to symbolize that his empire reached even to the lowest depths of the waters) \u2014 Albinus, Nov. Sax. Hist., p. 70. This image, which was raised on a pe- destal, was found on Mount Hercinius, in the ancient fortress of Hersburg, which was formerly called Saturburg, or the fortified hill of Satur or Saturn. \u2014 Montfaucon, Ant. Exp. c. 10.) But the chronic principle of existence is essentially of a twofold character \u2014 it is destructive as well as creative. Time, mythically regarded, is not alone the Progenitor of all things, but he is the Annihilator of all things likewise. If every entity \u2014 every little summer insect, and every frafl summer flower \u2014 spring forth in time, they pass away and are consumed in time also. Hence the mythologists of old, who told the stories of the various phenomena of nature in the most cunning and poetical fables, represented Saturn not only as the great Father, producing everything, but .as the great Ogre too, devouring everytlung \u2014 the \" edax rerum,\" indeed \u2014 whose love of destruction was such that, according to the fine old fable, he ate his own offspring. Accordingly, with the view of appeasing the savagery of the destructive principle of the great pagan deity, all manner of sacrifices came to be offered up to him, and horses and sheep, together with every hundredth man among then prisoners, were immolated, as Herodotus tells us, every year by the ancient Teutoni, so that the blood might serve to mitigate the blood- thirstiness of a being who was regarded as the great God of Battles and Slaughter. Again, Lucian informs us that the gcd of the old Germanic tribes delighted in human gore ; that his image was carried into battle by the troops, who drank to his honour the blood of the first foe they conquered ; that they scalped all whom they slew in the fight, and made drinking-cups out of the ornamented skulls of their greatest enemies. \"In-"], [351, "ANCIENT RELIGION OF THURINGIA. 335 deed,\" concludes Sharon Turner, \"the most formidable feature in the ancient religion of the Teutonic tribes was its separation from the pure and benevolent virtues of life, and its indissoluble union with war and violence.\" On the column of another Saxon idol, described by the brothers Meibomii in their learned \" History of German Things.\" which represented the figure of an armed warrior of old, and which was long preserved in the Monastery at Corbey \u2014 in the district of Paderbourn, not far from Cassel \u2014 was printed the following in scription: \u2014 \" i was the leader and god of the saxons. People of war adoeed me. THE NATION WHO WOBSHIPPED ME GOVERNED IN THE FIELD OF BATTLE.\" The crest of the helmet of this figure was a cock; on its br was engraven a bear; and the shield on its shoulders w: = em blazoned with a lion in a field full of flowers. In its right hand it held a banner, on which a red rose was conspicuous, while from its left depended a balance. \"The military,'' says Henry Mei bomius (Berum Germ. Hist.), \" clothed in armour, and bran dishing iron cestus, rode round this idol on certain solemn days, sometimes dismounting to kneel before it, and bowing down as they murmured out their prayers for help and victory.\" In the hour of battle the priests took the favourite image from its pe destal, and carried it into the field. . Twice in the twelvemonth the chief judge (who was called Gravius) and the youngest (who was styled Frond) went to the temple of the deity \u2014 which was without a roof, like that of Jupiter Fulminans \u2014 and there made a placatory offering of two wax lights and nine pieces of money, these ceremonies being performed in the months of April and October in every year.\u2014 (Mei b. c. iii. p. 10.) The astronomical explanation of the above symbols and cere monies it is not very difficult to perceive : the crest of the cock was used as the well-known type of the herald of the morning ; the figure of the bear referred to the constellation of that name, which always remains above the horizon during night ; the lion in the field full of flowers was indicative of the sign of the zodiac, which the sun enters in the summer solstice, when the meadows are covered with blossoms ; while the balance depending from the left hand was obviously in token of the other zodiacal sigu Libra,"], [352, "336 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. which the sun reaches at the time of the autumnal equinox, when the days and nights are of the same duration. Moreover, the two lights, which the judges presented as placatory offerings to the idol, would seem to have been symbolical either of the sun and moon, as the two luminaries by which the days and nights are reckoned, or else of the morning and evening star. The reason of thes eofferings being made in April and October was because the great changes in the seasons occurred in those months, at which time the sun used to reach the vernal and autumnal quarters : for though the equinoxes fall at the end of March and September now-a-days, it is demonstrable, from what is termed the \"precession\" of them (by which the sun is made to arrive at the signs Aries and Libra 20 minutes and 23 seconds earlier each year than it did in the preceding twelvemonth), that, some 1 500 or 2000 years ago, the commencement of spring and h iimn must have occurred about twenty or thirty days later than iv does at present. Tu3 name of this idol was Irmendsul, or Hermendsul, or Her mansav.l (for it was variously written), and the title according to Sharon Turner, signified Saul, the pillar \u2014 of Herman or Herr- Mond, the lord the moon, whom the Germans of old worshipped as a male deity \u2014 typifying the nocturnal luminary as a great hunter, and making him the presiding deity of war and slaughter, probably because such excursions were generally carried on in the night. The title of the god Herr-Mond came, in course of time, to be abbreviated into that of Hermann \u2014 for we have seen above that the idol's pillar was called both Hermendsul, and Herman saul. This name the Romans latinized into Arminius, and hear ing that the ancient Teutoni fought under such a leader (the image, as we have said, being taken off its pedestal on the eve of war, and carried into battle by the priests), Tacitus describes the idol as a living personage, speaking of him as being a Cheruscan, and a great general who lived at the time of Tiberius. There is a picture of this old German war-god given in the Chronicles of Magdeburg. It is very nearly the same as that described by Meibomius, with the exception that it is represented as standing defiantly, with the legs wide apart, in a field of flowers that reach nearly to the knees, and it is there styled the Saschische pib-gott Mars. Now in Thuriugia we are \"told that the blood of slain horses was offered up to the god of Time on the tops of the hills, because the simple folk believed the chariot of the sun had fiery steeds"], [353, "337 ANCIENT RELIGION OF THURINGIA. harnessed to it ; whilst the Thunder-god Thor (the equivalent of the Roman Jupiter Fulminans), who was merely a personification of the destructive attribute of tbe Time-deity, had many a sacrifi- cial altar erected to him on many a mountain summit \u2014 the Thus- ingian people having originally been called, it is said, after the name of the god Thor whom they specially worshipped. More- over, it was popularly believed, when the snow flakes fell thick and fast, as if they were the fragments of some shattered white cloud descending from heaven, that the Frau Hblle, the goddess of death, was shaking out her bed from the peaks of the Horsel- berg ; and that the noises, which were heard in the air at night during storms, were but the yelping of the hounds, and the sounding of the distant bugles of the \" Wild Huntsman \" and his foresters, who then came sallying forth from the base of the long chain of barren hills beside the Hbrsel stream, mounted upon horses, many of which, runs the legend, had only three legs, whilst not a few of the demon huntsmen carried their head under their arm or had their face turned towards their back. \u2014 Thuringer Chronick, p. 244. The Frau Hblle in the ancient religion of Thuringia was re- garded as the goddess of death, and every Christmas-time she was said to come out of the Horsel Mountains, and to go through Thuringia rewarding the busy spinners and threatening those who broke their threads, or were lazy at the wheel. Every year, too, sacrifices were offered up to the Thunder-god Thor on the tops of the highest hills, where horses were slaughtered in honour of the chief deity of the air ; and cakes were baked at the same time in the shape of the sun's rays, the crumbs of which were strewn over the fields to make them fertile. Moreover, the Pagan priests taught the simple forest-people that the earth was a giant, whose name was Ymer, that the running streams were the blood circling in his veins, the rocks were his bones, and the stones his teeth, while the plants and the grass of the fields were his bah, and the firmament his brain. They also fabled, that out of the poplar and the ash the first man and woman were formed. But the phenomena of nature consist of something more still than merely creation and destruction. There is a principle of re generation also for ever at work in the world : the trees and plants, whose branches are like the bones of skeletons at the end of one year, become round again in form, and gay with their brilliant blossoms at the beginning of the next ; the winding-sheet of 22"], [354, "338 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. snow, in which nature has lain so long shrouded, is at last cast aside, and the young earth in the spring time seems to rise from the tomb, like a maiden after a long trance, smiling again with new life and beauty ; the rivers and the springs, which had been as stagnant as dead men's blood throughout the winter, begin to pulse and circulate anew, on the breaking-up of the frost, through the blue veins of the fields ; and the snowdrops are seen peeping out of the hedge-rows, at the return of the spring, white and beautiful as the morning star, as it twinkles in the dusk and tells of the coining sun. Hence our pagan forefathers came, in the course of years, to temper the crude savagery of their ancient creeds ; and Time got to be no longer merely worshipped and reverenced as the Creator, or dreaded and sacrificed to as the Destroyer, but grew at length to be welcomed, and had feasts consecrated to him as the Kege nerator ; so that the old bi-partite principle of good and evil, in the Manich\u00e6an-like faith, ultimately assumed a triune arrange ment, after the fashion of the Hindoo Chrono-niyth, which is made to consist of Bramah, the Creator, Seva, the Destroyer or Avenger, and Vishnu, the Preserver and Regenerator. Then more hopeful creeds began to be spread among mankind. Pythagoras commenced teaching that the souls of men and even brutes, instead of being annihilated after death, transmigrated from one sentient body to another, in a long chain of spiritual life ; and strange theories, as to the existence of man in an im mortal state, after his decease, got to be propounded by the priests of Egypt, where huge pyramidal piles, honeycombed with tombs, were built up for the garnering of the bodies of the departed against the promised resurrection. Then, even Paganism grew to be no longer a matter of despair and terror on the one hand, or of blood and slaughter on the other, wherewith to appease the god of thunder and turn aside the wrath of the great Avenger; but it became, comparatively speaking, a thing of gladness and the sub ject of continual feasting and holiday-making. Then wassail, or, more properly speaking, wecltsel-songs were sung at every Christ mas-time, because that was the great change of the year, the sun reaching the winter solstice towards the latter end of December, after which the days begin to lengthen, and thus to give signs of the return of spring. Then great fires were made, and \" yule feasts \" held round every hearth, in honour of the coming sun ; the halls of high and low were decorated with the sacred plant of the old Druids, the mistletoe, and with such other bright green"], [355, "339 ANCIENT RELIGION OF THURINGIA. leaves and berries as the season afforded, as reminders that the flowers aud fruits were soon to come again ; while merry-makiugs and revelry abounded in every Saxon home. Then wassail-bowls of spiced ale and apples were drunk, and carols were chanted within and without the houses by the old \" gleemen,\" who jour- neyed from homestead to homestead with their lutes, either singing of the joyous love-time that was soon to gladden the earth once more, or else hymning the praises of the brave warrior Wodin, who had battled with the elements, and put the northern or wintry host to flight. Then, too, the mummers went about dressed up as the goddess of death, with a sack at her back, and attended by her train of wild sportsmen, to carry off the wicked children from their homes. These were, and are still, called in Saxony the Morz-menschen (literally, the death-folk) ; and close after them came the good spirits, to save the pious boys and girls, who prayed to them, from the clutches of the Evil One, and to scatter apples, nuts, and all kinds of homely sweets as a reward for the prayers of the little ones. But the great pagan feast of all throughout the twelvemonth was that of Easter, for this (most people now-a days have to be reminded of the fact) was really the festival of the new year in the olden time ; since it was not till a.d. 1751 that New Year's Day was, even in England, appointed to fall by Act of Parliament, on the 1st of January, previous to which date the year always commenced on the 25th of March. So that the Novennial festi- vities which are now celebrated in every continental city, were, before the calendar was changed from the \"old style\" to the \" new,\" always carried on at Easter, seeing that at that time Sylvester fell, not upon the eve of the 31st December, but upon that of the 24th March instead ; and it was on Easter midnight that the church bells rang out a peal, once a twelvemonth, to welcome in the new year, and that molten lead was then cast into a bowl of water so as to foreshadow what would be the for- tunes of the different members of the household in the coming twelvemonth. It was at Easter too, that the folk appeared in the new clothes that were to last them through the year \u2014 a custom, indeed, which prevads in Saxony to the present day. Then the bonfires were lighted on every hill-top to welcome the advent of the spring, and burning wheels sent rolling down the mountain- sides in token of the coming of the fiery chariot of the sun ! whilst a straw figure was made up to represent the spirit of darkness, or the old god Thor, whose reign had come to an end ;"], [356, "340 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. and after being carried through the highways and the villages, was ultimately cast, amid general rejoicings, into the nearest river. Then garlanded poles were set up in the market-places, round which the girls and boys danced for very joy at the return of the sweet spring time ; whilst others in motley paper dresses sported about, and others got up as \" wild men, \" as they were called, rushed hither and thither habited in a dress of green fir-twigs. At the same festive season, moreover, came the German Minne-sdngers, the wandering love-singers, with their guitars in their hands, to tell, in the halls of nobles and in the homesteads of the yeomen, of the joys and eharms of the deity Eostre Ostrea, or Ostera, the Saxon goddess of love and beauty, in whose honour the feast was celebrated, and whose praises it was their special office to sing. The German Minne-sdnger is described in the dictionaries as an erotic singer, i. e. one who sang love-songs ; the word Minne being equivalent to Liebe, love, the root of which appears in the French mignon, a darling, and in the Welsh mwyn, tender, gentle. The English word minstrel, which comes to us from the French menetrier, or mene-strier, belongs to the same radix \u2014 the affix -sfri\u00abr being merely a dialectic mode of writing the Saxon termi nation ster, as found in pun-ster, game ster, spin-ster, lob-ster, web-ster, &c. The Minne-sdngers, it is said, were so called be cause their songs were originally dedicated to the Liebe-frau, or Blessed Virgin ; but, unfortunately, this explanation goes only half-way to the source of the title. This same Liebe-frau, to whom the Catholics have always paid such high veneration, was nothing more nor less than the pagan goddess of love, Ostera, the Magada \u2014 the maiden deity, Easter, adapted to those old papal rites, which may be described as a kind of transformed paganism. For the early priests, finding that the ancient Saxon people were wedded to the great Easter festival, which constituted the principal holiday-time of the year ; and that the young maiden goddess of love was the deity to whom their songs, their dances, and their revels were dedicated, soon took care to give the pagan orgies a kind of Christian rendering. They converted therefore the Saxon goddess, Ostera, the love-maiden, who was merely the mythic personification of the beauty and the joys of the spring, into the Liebe-frau, the virgin-mother of Christ\u2014 even as the ancient Romans had changed the Teutonic Wonne into the Latin Venus. It seems probable, we may add, that the tournaments of the Middle Ages had also their origin in these ancient Easter festi-"], [357, "341 ANCIENT RELIGION OF THURINGIA. vities. The Queen of Beauty, it is well known, originally pre sided at the chivalrous contest, and she was, doubtlessly, intended as the type of the beautiful maiden Ostera. the goddess of love and delight ; whilst the tournay itself would seem to have been emblematical of the mythic battle between summer and winter, such as was formerly enacted, though in a different form, at the Thuringian festival called \" the summer's victory \" \u2014 the sun himself being often personified as a handsome young minstrel knight ; even as we find him fabled in the old Thuringian legend of the loves of Tannhauser and Venus. Moreover, may not the romantic institution of chivalry itself have had the same mythic origin, and the knights-errant, who went forth with their lances, ready to do battle for love and beauty, have been primarily sym bolical of the sun fighting with the spirits of darkness for the sake of the young maiden goddess of delight? In after-years, of course, a semi-Christian turn was given by the priests to the objects of the chivahic order ; still, it would seem as if the old tradition of King Arthur himself, and the \" Knights of the Bound Table\" (probably another symbol for the sun) referred to some such mythic allegory. Again \u2014 the papal legend of the Wandering Jew is only another Christian rendering of the mythological fable, which spoke of the sun under the name of Abaris, as one destined to wander over the earth till the end of all time. Indeed, in the ancient system of fire-worship, the sun was always typified as the great wanderer ; and hence wandering, whether for the sake of minstrelsy, chivalry, or even pilgrimage, or beggary (as was the custom with the medi\u00e6val minne-singers, knights-errant, mendicant friars, pil grims, and bacchantes), came to assume a noble and sacred cha racter, and to be ultimately intermingled by the Papists of old with the forms of Christianity itself, This Saxon goddess of the spring bore also the name Mogoda (Gothic Magath), a title that was given to every young unmarried woman, so that the name of \" maiden,\" or \" Maid\"/>\u00abr excellence \u2014 which was afterwards abbreviated into simple May \u2014 came to be applied to this season of the year. In the old Chronicles of Magdeburg is a picture of this same Saxon goddess Ostera, who was also called Magada, the virgin deity, in which she is represented as standing on a car, drawn by two white swans and two doves. She carries a rose-bud in her mouth, and has a wreath of myrtle and roses on her head. In her left hand she bears an orb typical of the world over which"], [358, "342 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. she has supreme power, and in her right she holds three golden apples as a symbol that she is bringing fruit to mankind, while be hind her stand the three graces, Kindness, Love, and Gratitude. The month in which the spring festivities were held was termed Wonne-monath, or Wonne-mond, the time of love and delight ; for the young maiden deity of the spring was called also Wonne, the goddess of love, a name which, as we have said, was changed by the Latins into that of Venus ; and as it was the original vocation of the Minne-sdngers to frame verses in honour of the lovely young vernal-divinity, all kinds of fanciful allegories came to be invented by these ancient poets (who were to the Saxon priests what the bards of old were to the British Druids) as to how the beautiful golden-haired young sun-god was enamoured of tbe budding charms of the fair virgin spring \u2014 tales which the ancient Romans rendered as the loves of Venus and Adonis, and the less poetical Germans those of Tannhauser and Venus. In the Thuringian capital, moreover, Easter-tide is, to this day, the time in which the return of the spring is welcomed, with three successive \"rest-days\" \u2014 as they are happfly called \u2014 for then all work ceases, even down to bread-making by the baker ; and this season and Whitsuntide (the old Roman May-day) are still the principal periods. of the year for making excursions into the country, and enjoying the new beauties of the earth. On the Sunday called in the calendar Latare, which is a Latin word signifying to rejoice, and which falls always three weeks before Easter, the little town of Eisenach has, from time imme morial, been a scene of merriment and holiday-making ; for then and there has ever been, and is still, held the peculiar spring festival entitled Sommer Gewinuung \u2014 the Victory of Summer."], [359, "CHAPTER XXVII. THE OLD PAGAN FEAST OF SUMMER'S VICTORY, AS IT IS KEPT AT THK PRESENT TIME IN THE THURINGIAN CAPITAL. The art of periodical men-y-making has been lost in our nation for many years. We befogged Englishmen have only one really joyous day in the entire 365, and even that comes at the end of December, when the elements are diametrically opposed to every- thing like happiness al fresco. May-day has long ago been given over to our chimney-sweepers, and the Easter Greenwich Fair has at length disappeared from the British calendar ; while Midsummer-day, in the same record, is set down merely as the season when \" rents become payable,\" and \" insurances fall due.\" Better housing, perhaps, has made our folk less dependent than foreigners upon the sunshine and the fields for their enjoyment ; for certain it is that the seasons come round without the least sign of public exultation in England. With a snug English hearth, crimson with its glowing sea-coal fire, a thick velvet-pile carpet spread all over the floor, and the warm and heavy woollen curtains drawn close before the windows, winter is no longer regarded, by the Saxons in England, as the season over which the goddess of death and the spirits of darkness have special sway ; any more than the return of spring needs to be publicly welcomed, in a country where green peas and strawberries are to be had ah the year round, and the footmen on bridal-days carry nosegays as big as cauliflowers, made up of the choicest Damascus roses and lilies of the valley \u2014 ay ! even though the snow lies as thick as lamb's-wool on the ground. In the still primitive region of Thuringia, however, the great periods of rejoicing among the people are principally in celebra tion of the advent of the more pleasant seasons. Christmas, in Saxony, is regarded as a feast comparatively secondary to that of"], [360, "344 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the New Year; for though there are three days' holidays con- nected with the Nativity, still the feast of U'eihnachten, which signifies literally the holy or consecrated nights, from weihen, to dedicate to sacred purposes (Latin ven-eror) is by no means of the same joyous character as with us. Whereas New Year's Day in Germany, as in France, is regarded as one of the chief holi- days of the twelvemonth. There is no doubt, however, that our merry-makings at Christmas are merely the remains of the festivities in which our Saxon forefathers were wont to indulge at the change of the year ; even as the \" wassail songs \" and bowls customary with us on such occasions, and concerning the meaning of which so much philological nonsense has been written, were merely verses and drinks dedicated to the principal change in the length of the days at that period \u2014 the German word wechsel, as we have said, having come in the course of time to be thus corrupted. True, Christmas-trees are general in all Lutheran families throughout Germany ; but such trees, we know, are comparatively modern innovations, and the gifts which with us are usual on \" boxing day,\" are in Germany invariably reserved for the first day of the New Year. So, again, instead of any feast being held on Christmas Eve, the orgie is reserved among the Germans for the last night of the old year, when everybody thinks himself called upon to eat lentils and herrings, and to sit up drinking wassail-bowls till midnight, so that the New Year may be duly welcomed in ; while on the morrow, all who can in any way afford the expense, think themselves bound to make a \" Parties as it is called, or, in other words, to join in some excursion into the country. So again at Easter and Whitsuntide, the national rejoicings are more connected with welcoming the return of the spring than those religious rites with which they have been associated by the Fathers of the Church ; for on \" Green-Thursday,\" or the day before Good Friday, it is customary to collect the greenest moss to be found in the woods, and to shape this into birds' nests, or hares' nests as they are sometimes called, which, after they have been secretly filled with the sugar eggs that every confectioner's shop is crammed with at this period of the year, are hidden in all kinds of bye-places and corners about the house for the young children to find. Of the mythic meaning of this old pagan custom \u2014 and indeed of the Catholic Easter eggs themselves \u2014 we shall have occasion to speak hereafter. At tbe same season"], [361, "THE FEAST OF SUMMER'S VICTORY. 345 it is usual for all manners of cakes to be baked, as well as dou^h images of little hares to be placed in the nests, together with bright-coloured or sugar eggs, for the little ones. At the same period, too, long excursions are made into the country, and the highest mountain-tops visited, so that the sun may be seen to come up from behind the great chain of hills at day-break. Moreover, on Easter Eve the curious custom prevails among the girls of Thuringia to fetch water from the nearest brook (for unless the stream be a running one, the fluid it is said is of no avail) wherewith to wash their faces; for the belief runs that if the water be collected as the clock strikes twelve, on the night before Easter Sunday, without a word being spoken either at the brook-side or on the way home, it has the wonderful charm of beautifying all those maidens who may bathe their cheeks in it. Further: at Whitsuntide the holidays have more to do with the approach of summer than any moveable feast of the Christian Church ; for then large branches of newly-budding birch-trees are sold in the market-places, and these are stuck in pots in each corner of the room as a sign that the earth is once more bursting into leaf and blossom. At this season, too, almost all the families go out with their children long before day-light into the woods, so as to eat their breakfast there at sunrise, within some newly- made natural bower. Then the students flock to the Thuringian capital, and the hotel or inn at which they put up is made a mass of green for the occasion ; while the University scholars set out in a long procession with banners flying and music playing to the top of the Wartburg Hill, there to make the woods resound either with their student hymn of \" Gaudeamus igitur,\" or else to make the air reverberate with some other fine student-choral. Indeed, from almost every hill-top, for miles round about the city, the sounds of song and rejoicing are heard at this season us the year. Nor should we omit to state that at this period the same dancing round about a garlanded pole goes on in the Thuringian capital, as was formerly customary in our own country at May- day ; for outside of the Jrirgen Thor (George Gate) in Eisenach, the people, till within two or three years ago, used to dance in dresses decorated with bits of bright-coloured paper and tinsel, after the manner of our chimney-sweepers to the present day. But though the paper dresses have disappeared, the waltzing still continues ; and we ourselves went there with our family to"], [362, "346 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. see it but a twelvemonth back, when the master of the cere monies, in a cocked hat, was polite enough to inform us (after we had drunk to the people's health to the sound of a flourish of trumpets, and paid proportionately for the honour), that if our daughter would like to join the dance, he would find her as nice a young man as he could for a partner. Next ; at summer, there is Johannis-tag, literally St. John's day, when the little children are taken out to dance at some of the beer-gardens in the country ; and in the autumn there are the Eirmes, or village rejoicings, immediately the harvest is finished, when dancing goes ou under the linden trees from morning till night \u2014 whon the peasant-girls are dressed in all their new clothes, bought especially for the holiday \u2014 and the peasant-boys have fastened to their button-hole the long bright coloured neck-scarves that their sweethearts have presented to them on the occasion ; while some of the village Don' Juans make their appearance with two or three such gifts, dangling from their coats, evidently proud to show how many a maiden is anxious to win them. At such times crowds flock over to the villages to witness the sport; for then sheep are ridden for by the peasant-boys mounted on all the cart-horses of the neighbour hood ; and when the animal is caught, it is killed aud roasted for the feast ; while every visitor who attends the festival is ex pected to drink to the health of the villagers, the band giving a flourish of trumpets the while, and the peasants shouting \" Lebe hoch !\" (Live well !) as the glass of sour \" double beer \" is quaffed \u2014 a donation of some few groschens towards the ex penses of the entertainment being expected from the visitor for the honour thus paid to him. Finally, as the days draw in, and the falling snow-flakes tell of the coming winter, the Morz-menschen (literally the death folks) come round and visit the houses at night. These generally con sist of a party of lads dressed up for the occasion. One is attired as an old woman, to represent the Frau Holle, the old Thuringian goddess of death, who was said to inhabit the Horsel Mountains hard by, and, as the fable ran, to be shaking out the feather bed on which she had slept through the summer, imme diately the snow began to descend ; while another is costumed as Eckart, the guardian of day and night, in flowing robes and long grey beard. It is customary, during this November mummery, for the lads who accompany old Eckart and the Frau Holle to the house, to throw apples and sweetmeats on the floor for the"], [363, "THE FEAST OF SUMMKUS VICTORY. 347 good children ; and when the old death frau seeks to prevent the little ones getting them and to pick them up for herself, the others beat her off, and seek to drive her from the house, saying, \" she is not wanted there.\" Then she asks if there are any naughty children in the family, and if so, she says she has come to carry them away in her sack to the dark hole in the Horsel hills, never to see their parents again. The hag, however, is generally assured that none but good children are to be found in that house ; whereupon she is in a measure appeased, and ulti- mately dragged by the others from the dwelling. This ancient mythical comedy has at present sunk into a mere mumming farce, of which many of the Thuringian people them- selves are utterly ignorant as to the fabular meaning ; and it is now merely customary for the lad whose name can be guessed in spite of his disguise, to stop and take his supper with the family who have made the discovery, so that at last it has lapsed into a mere game and frolic rather than a fine old seasonable allegory. The above account includes all the principal feasts and cere- monies observed on the high-days and holidays at the different seasons of the year throughout Thuringia. True, many of them, at the present day, occur at the periods with which some Christian rite has come to be connected ; but history teaches us that such public rejoicings existed long before the introduction of Chris- tianity, and that they were essentially connected with that kind of paganism or mythology which consisted in the worship of the different brute forms and powers of Nature, rather than the om- niscient God of Creation Himself. And we know, moreover, that it was the custom of the early Fathers of the Catholic Church to give to those feasts and holidays, to which they found the heathen people of every country too strongly attached to be induced to forego them, some Christian rendering, or some religious connec- tion or other ; so that, while the old forms of rejoicing were main tained, a new meaning was attached to them. And thus the old Saxon Yule-festival at the change of the year, came to be trans lated into the feast of the Nativity ; the worship of the Saxon maiden-goddess Eostre, at the beginning of the spring-time, to be changed into rites in commemoration of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of the Saviour ; even as the old heathen holidays or rejoicings at Whitsuntide, in celebration of the approach of sum mer, came, in the course of time, to be connected with the feast of the Pentecost."], [364, "348 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. We have, however, in the above enumeration of the several Thuringian feasts, purposely omitted the mention of that curious relic of Saxon paganism which forms the subject of the present chapter ; because it affords us too profound an insight into the manner and faith of the ancient Saxon race to be passed over with a mere cursory notice. Moreover, within the last few years, it has been so stripped of the mythical ceremonies that were for merly connected with it, that it is sinking rapidly into a mere fair and scene of unmeaning revelry and riot ; so that some record is required as to the customs prevailing at present, and, moreover, as to what they were even in the time of the youthful days of the oldest residents still living in the Thuringian capital. This ancient pagan feast, which is called in Saxony Sommer Gewinnung, or Sommer Gewinn, and which, literally translated, means Summer's Victory, is held every year, on the Sunday which, in the old \" Volks' Kalenders,\" bears the name of Latare. In Eisenach, however, among the people, the day is familiarly known by the title of \" Dead Sunday,\" because, as we shall see hereafter, it was customary to carry the effigy of the defunct Winter-God through the streets of the town, and to bury him with all kinds of rejoicing, on that day. This \" Dead Sunday,\" or Latare, occurs three weeks before the movable feast of Easter, and the festivities, therefore, always take place somewhere about the month of March, according as Easter falls early or late in the year ; and it is not until some three or four hours after the mid day meal that the festivities are supposed to begin. The after noon service, however, has no sooner ceased in the churches, than the streets at the one end of the town are comparatively deserted, while at the other they are thronged with the number of men, women, and children, peasants aud soldiers, workmen and shop boys, who are all wending their way in a body, packed in the narrow thoroughfares as if they were a flock of sheep, panting along to the same fold. All the morning through, the peasant-women have been pour ing in from the neighbouring villages \u2014 the younger ones in their turbaned head-dresses and their short, closely-plaited skirts, and the old wives in their stiff, black, and tight-fitting \" snout-caps,\" as they are called \u2014 from the fact of their having a long, thin peak ou the forehead, reaching almost to the bridge of the nose. Others have come in long, narrow wagons, not unlike large pig-troughs, made in wicker-work, and with the peasant boys aud girls packed"], [365, "THE FEAST OF SUMMERS VICTORY. 349 in them as close as children in an excursion van. Some of the village wives have trudged in with their chiffonier-like baskets strapped to their back, and with one or two tiny heads of little children peeping over the top of the corb, and with the invariable bright-red cotton umbrella, too, stuck in the basket beside them. Gotha women are there, wearing high black silk coronals, orna mented with black feathers and lace, and with long, broad, black ribbons, reaching from the crown of the head almost to the heels; while the peasant-men thronging the streets are almost all in high jack-boots and habited in long, duffle, dressing-gown-like coats, with leg-of-mutton sleeves and the shortest possible waists, and with fluffy beaver hats that have been in their family, and worn only on Sundays and at funerals, for centuries. As the visitor approaches towards the Jdrgen Thor, the crowd grows thicker and thicker, and the streets are lined with serving maids, in shawls and bare heads, like the lower order of Irish girls with us, and with dim, dingy-looking, stunted boys of foot-soldiers, in their faded spinach-green and mustard-trimmed uniforms, and looking about as seedy and unwarlike as so many fire-brigade men off duty. Then there are the post-office clerks or secretaries, \"got-up\" like French Polytechnic boys (minus the cocked hat), with swords at their sides ; and railway officials, in suits of bright azure blue and silver, and students of the \" Forest-School,\" in Garibaldi hats and light grey Juppen (a kind of short paletot, drawn in at the back, and befrogged and braided with no end of bright green trimming). And as this motley and peculiar crowd jostles along down the narrow Jorgen-strasse that leads to the site of the fair, rows of heads are thrust out of all the windows on the shady side of the street ; and here, at every casement, lines of young ladies are to be seen lolling upon cushions ranged along the window-sills, and watching the mob of citizens, soldiers, pea sants, and serving-maids with their swains, on their way to buy at least a Eiichelhahn (a bantam cock) for their children or their sweethearts. On the opposite or sunny side of this same George-street, a far different custom prevails. There not a head is to be found at any of the windows ; and as you pass by the casements of the ground floors, you cannot help seeing the rooms filled with company, to whom coffee is being served out of the gaudy \"presentation cups\" that are kept only for high-days and holidays ; while the tables are strewn with all kinds of biscuits and cakes for the regalement of the guests. At these dwellings, time out of mind, it has been"], [366, "350 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the custom to keep open house, as it were, on this particular Sun day, and to invite all manner of people to join in the coffee-drink ings which then take place in every room on every floor of every one of tbe houses on that side of the street enjoying a southern aspect. These sunny-side houses, moreover, have the privilege of selling at this season any kind of \" bake-work,\" as it is called \u2014 that is to say, such cakes or confectionery \u2014 as they may for the time being, please to deal in ; the sale of such articles being, at other times, restricted solely to the licensed bakers and confec tioners of the town. This strange privilege was granted to them in return for the eggs which each house was obliged to contribute to the friars during Lent; and accordingly, as you wend your way, you see trays of biscuits, and cakes and sweetmeats set out at doors on this day where the business at other times is restricted to the sale of ironmongery or saddlery, or, maybe, of sausages and butcher's-meat. At some of the houses here, again, you find a live cock in a magpie-cage dangling from the end of a pole out of the first-floor windows ; while at others apples are let down by a string into the crowd for the boys to jump and bob at. And only a few years ago, we were assured by an old couple who lived in this street, that it was usual for all the persons on the sunny side of the way to ornament their houses with branches of fir, decked out with bits of bright-coloured chintz or paper, and with stained eggs attached at intervals to the boughs ; and these were festooned upon the walls until the houses were nearly covered with them. At the time of our visits to the scene, however, in the years 1862 and 1863, no such fir decorations were to be seen. Beyond the Jorgen Thor, as it is still called (though the George's Gate that once stood there has long since been re moved), stretches the broader thoroughfare of the \" fore-town.\" And here, again, on the sunny side of the way \u2014 and on the sunny side of the way only \u2014 are arranged, at the edge of the narrow foot-path, a long line of stalls and tiny booths for the sale of the different articles which are, for the most part, to be bought only at this time of the year. And as you elbow your way down the narrow path between the booths and the houses, the crush and the rush of unruly peasants and riotous boys remind one somewhat of the scenes at an English fan. Here you find one little table set out with a display of paper flowers in earthen pots ; then you come to a grander booth for the sale of sweet meats, coloured eggs, and cakes in the form of true lovers' knots,"], [367, "THE FEAST OF SUMMERS VICTORY. 351 as well as raw ham and sausage sandwiches, together with bright tinted drinks for the regalement of the lads and their sweethearts. Here, too, you will see a large, bright, brass urn, for the supply of glasses of hot grog for the more extravagant and uproarious of the visitors. Further on, is a small stall, covered with models of bantam-cocks (in natural feathers) of all sizes\u2014 from little things that are not nearly as big as humming-birds to great toys that are the size of full-grown thrushes. Subjoined is a photo graph of one of the largest as well as the smallest of these birds, which we purchased for our servant, and for which we paid a matter of fourpence for the one, and a halfpenny for the other. The purchase of these same Euchelhdhne, or bantam cocks, constitutes the principal \"fun of the fair\" at the present day. Every lad, who is old enough to have a sweetheart in the town or villages round about, thinks himself called upon to buy one of these toys for the damsel at the Sommer-gewinn ; and you will see the apprentices and bauer-boys strutting along with the mimic birds attached to their button-hole, or stuck into their cap, as a sign they have not forgotten the looked-for present on such an occasion. Now, time out of mind, this same bird has been reverenced as the herald of the morning, and there cannot be the least doubt that, taken in connection with the other mythical symbols which are sold at this time (and at this time only) in Eisenach, these same feathered images are there merely as types that the darkness"], [368, "352 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of the winter-time has been dispelled, and as emblems that the light of the summer's sunshine is about to gladden the earth. To the modern boors of Thuringia, however, the meaning of the pagan fable has long been lost, and the custom of welcoming the herald of the sun into the houses, has lapsed at length into a mere rude and stupid jest. In our own country we know that the custom formerly prevailed of throwing at the cock at Shrovetide, but what was the meaning of such a practice it is difficult to conjecture. The very custom, however, proves that this same bird was supposed to have some mythical connection with the season ; and probably the moral of the fable was that, owing to the darkness which prevails at the beginning of the year, old Chanticleer had become in a measure a useless creature, and was therefore fit only to be knocked off his perch at the commence- ment of the season of long fasting and penitence. Another peculiar article, that was purchased at such times, consisted of small decorated fir-boughs, hung with gilded nuts and glittering toys, as well as sugar ornaments and gaudilv- coloured eggs, for the special delight of the children to whom they were given. \" The inhabitants of the town,\" says Johann Wilhelm Storch, who wrote an \"Historical Account of Eisenach\" in the year 1837, \" buy fir- boughs at the feast of Sommer-gewinn, decorated with toys, sweetmeats, and other ornaments. To these decorated boughs the name of 'Summer' is given; and laden with them the Eisenachers return with their joyful children to their homes\" (p. 211). These ornamented fir-branches used to go by the name of \" Sommer,\" and it is obvious that the evergreen boughs of the pine tree were used merely as being significant of the verdure that was shortly to cover the entire earth ; while the bright- coloured toys and sweetmeats told merely of the beauty of the flowers and the delights of the coming summer time. For as in Rome, the myrtle was dedicated to Venus who, there is no doubt, was but the Roman form of the Saxon virgiu-goddess Eostre \u2014 the \" Maid,\" or Magath, as she was called in the old city of Magdeburg (a city which derives its name from the same deity from whom, indeed, springs the name of the lovely month of May itself \u2014 that month which the Germans term expressively Wonne monat, that is to say, the month of love and delight, or in other words, Venus' month \u2014 for there is not the least doubt that these same deities Venus, Eostre, Magath, and Maia, had but one common origin) \u2014 so, we say, as the myrtle was dedicated"], [369, "THE FEAST OF SUMMER'S VICTORY. 353 to Venus in ancient Rome, ic was but natural that the principal evergreen, the Tanne-haum, of Saxony should come to be con secrated to a cognate goddess of the same season. And that such was really the case, the old legends of Venus and Tann hauser (the word Tannhauser meaning literally one who lives in au evergreen house or bower) places the matter beyond the pos sibility of dispute. Here is a picture of such an ornamented \"summer bough,\" with its egg-garlands, and cakes, and bags of sweetmeats dangling from it, as used to be sold, a few years ago, at the Eisenach feast of the Summer's Victory. But the most peculiar of all the mythical toys still to be found on the stalls at this Sommer-gewinn, and which we believe are to be met with in no other part of the world, are the pith figures and dolls which are to be purchased at almost every other booth, ranged beside the footway. These figures consist of grotesque images of birds with two necks ; of models of Easter eggs ; and of puppets bearing either baskets of flowers on their head, or else 23"], [370, "354 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. carrying tiny nosegays in their hand. They are all more or less decorated with gold-leaf and pieces of bright- coloured paper, and cost but a few groschens apiece. Such toys are made by the poor people of the town, and though modern innovation has led to the manufacture of many other such figures out of the pith of the elder tree (we saw one that was said to be a model of the Emperor Napoleon on the stalls last year), it is beyond question that only a few years back such articles consisted solely of the old mythic emblems of the seasons. Here, for instance, is a copy of one of the pith figures we bought last year, and which we were assured was meant for the image of summer. Of course, in mere black and white it is im possible to give the reader a notion of the tinsel and colour with which the little doll was decorated. It cost us a matter of three pence to obtain possession of it, and was for such simple handi work by no means a clumsy performance. Still by far the more curious and illustrative of these pagan idols remains to be explained. These are the flying birds with two necks before spoken of, which even in this Lutheran country bear the irreverent name of \" Holy Ghosts.\" In the first house"], [371, "THE FEAST OF SUMMERS VICTORY. 355 in which we lived in Eisenach there was one of these ornaments hanging from the ceiling, and for a long time after taking posses sion of the premises we were under the impression that it was merely a rude form of fly-cage placed there for the preservation of the furniture. A laundress girl, however, who came to iron at the house, no sooner saw it than she informed us we did well to have that image of the \"Holy Ghost\" hanging in our rooms, for that so long as it was kept there, no harm could possibly befall any person under the roof With the same view the images are purchased by the more superstitious of the peasants and people of Thuringia year after year, and kept dangling from the ceiling of their sitting-rooms until the next twelvemonth comes round. Now, before proceeding to explain the significance of such em blems, let us refer the reader to the preceding picture, which is a copy of one of the most elaborate of the symbols that we could obtain at the spring fair \u2014 merely adding that the original was of about the size of an ordinary shoe, and highly emblazoned (though it cost but sixpence) with all kinds of colours and gold leaf. The figure when first seen appears so utterly unlike the remains of a pagan idol, that it requires some little patience, as well as knowledge of the ancient mythical allegories, to be able to unravel its significance. In London there is an old tavern-sign called \"The Swan with Two Necks,\" and because learned philologists were unable to understand the meaning of such a phrase, they jumped to the conclusion that it originally meant the swan with"], [372, "356 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. two nicks (i. e. with two cuts on its bill, from the Saxon nican, Latin, necare, to cut), urging with some little plausibility in sup port of the assumption, that it is still customary for the Court of Aldermen, when they go \" swan-hopping,\" as it is called, on the Thames every year, to place such nicks or cuts on the bills of the cygnets, as a mark whereby to identify them. But here we have the same two-necked bird exhibited to us as the remains of an old religious emblem. What then is the key to the mystery? Now, we have before shown that the early religion of the Thuringian people was merely a modified form of fire-worship. or rather that deification of the different heavenly bodies and invisible powers of the air and revolutions of the seasons which lay at the very foundation of all heathen mythology. Throughout Germany it is known to scholars that the moon was worshipped as a male deity, rather than under the form of the chaste goddess Diana as among the ancient Romans ; and that sacrifices were offered up to him under the title \" Herr Mond,\" the lord moon, the presiding god of battles and hunting \u2014 probably from such excursions having taken place in the night time. From the title, Herr Mond, came that of the great Ger man myth Hermann or Arminius, as the Latins rendered the name, and Herminsule, as he was afterwards called by the Saxons \u2014 the great Teuton warrior, who led his followers on to battle and conquest ; for it was inscribed on the pillars of this same Saxon idol that he was the leader of the people in battle ; and it is known that it was usual for the early German tribes to carry the wooden figure of Herminsule always with them to the field. In Greece and Rome, moreover, the sun was deified under the name of Apollo and Adonis \u2014 the gods of love, poetry, music, youth, re generation, and, indeed, of all that was graceful and perpetually young on the face of the earth. We know, moreover, that as the early religion of almost every race scattered over the globe, with the exception of the Jews, was merely a tabular and allegorical form of astronomy, so it was customary with the priests of old to keep everything secret from the vulgar; and that the wonderful fables and apparently miraculous myths which they preached to the people were merely the stories of the seasous and the stars told in mystic language. For instance, it was current among the Greeks that one Abaris was doomed to wander to all eternity all over the earth without ever growing old, or .without even tasting either food or drink. But Abaris was another name for the sun. and here we have the key, not only to this mystery, but"], [373, "THE FEAST OF SUMMERS VICTORY. 357 even to that Catholic legend in which the early fathers trans formed this same Abaris into the wandering Jew. Even so the ancient Hierarchs taught the people that there was one bird \u2014 and only one bird of its kind\u2014 which, after being burnt, was re created from its own ashes. This was the Ph\u0153nix, said they ; but the Ph\u0153nix, again, was only another title of the same lumi nary \u2014 from <p,aivit), I shine or appear. It would require many a page were we to recount all the won derful stories in which the courses of the heavenly bodies were metaphorically, and therefore, as it were, miraculously, described to the people. Suffice it to say, not only was the movement of the sun in the air symbolized as that of a bird ; or deified as the God of Music, because at the dawning of his beams the groves always resounded with the warbling of the feathered tribes ; but he was also typified under the name of Adonis, as the principle of regeneration, because at the spring-time his rays were the means of clothing the earth once more with verdure ; or else it was described as a ship sailing in quest of the golden fleece. Indeed, there is hardly a beautiful type, or elegant symbol, in which the course of this same luminary was not mystically spoken of to the vulgar. So that when we come to consider all these things, we find but little difficulty in solving the mystery of the old pagan emblem of the bird with two necks, which is to this day sold under the name of the \" Holy Ghost \" to the supersti tious peasant-folk at the feast of \" Summer's Victory\" in Thur ingia. The bird with two necks is then thus simply rendered into the twin luminaries, the sun and moon ; while the smaller bird with but one neck, pendant from one of the beaks of the double-necked bird, is symbolical merely of the morning or evening star, which heralds the coming either of the orb of day or night. The egg hanging from the other bill is nothing more than the type of those same Easter offerings, which, under all kinds of colours, still prevail among the Catholics, and, indeed in many primitive countries. What was the myth in connection with the gift of such eggs at Easter, or, rather, spring-time, is not immediately apparent. At first, we were under the impression that the little ball dangling from the left beak was typical^of the globe itself, over which these twin birds are destiued to hover ; but then we remembered that in the ancient mythology the earth was considered to be a flat plate, with its corners resting on mountains, and the whole sup ported on the shoulders of the giant Atlas below. Next we thought"], [374, "358 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. it might be the symbol of eternity, for the words ovum and \u0153vum are etymologically connected in all languages. Still, we had no recollection of eggs being used, and reverently regarded, as such symbols. The simpler explanation is, therefore, that the egg, particularly at Easter or spring-time, is the one special type of the new gene ration that is shortly to follow ; and for the celebration of, and rejoicing over which new generation, we know that the spring feasts dedicated to the virgin goddess Eostre were principally instituted. We have seen, moreover, that the custom still pre vails in Thuringia of hiding about the house birds' nests, filled with bright-coloured or sugar-eggs, or else with little hares, made out of cake, for the delight of the little ones. And all this appears to us to prove, that as the ever-green fir-boughs were reverentially regarded at this season of the year as the emblem of the coming regeneration of the earth itself, and as a token of the universal verdure and brightness which was to succeed the long snow and darkness of the winter-time ; so these same Easter eggs came to be held in the same reverence by the people of old, as being sig nificant of the new generation of birds which the warmth of the sun was shortly to call into life, and the sounds of happiness and song which were once more to waken up every grove and thicket in the country round. It is customary at the fair of the \" Summer Victory \" for the still superstitious peasantry of Thuringia to purchase hard-boiled eggs of all colours of the rainbow, and also eggs made out of sugar, from the size of the tiniest birds' eggs up to those of geese, and even swans. Many of these sugar eggs are tricked out with rib bons of the most vivid dyes, and made to open and reveal either a case of trinkets or figures of little dressed-up dolls. Annexed is the picture of such a sugar Easter egg, purchased in Eisenach, with the figure of a little baby inside."], [375, "THE FEAST OF SUMMERS VICTORY. 359 The more expensive articles cost not unfrequently over a thaler, while the cheaper commodities may be had for even less than a farthing. The more common and curious models of the Easter eggs, however, are sold at the fair, and made out of the same pith as the tokens before described, and ornamented with gold and bright colours after the same fashion. Here is a literal represen- tation of one, for which we gave a farthing at the last \"Summer's Victory.\" One other point still remains to be cleared up for the perfect comprehension of the symbol of the two-necked bird, before de- scribed. The reader on referring to the illustration at page 355, will (or rather, should be able to) discover in the shadow at the under-part of the bird's body, a tiny glass window, and the head of a little man peeping behind it. What can this mean ? Which particular pagan deity was it meant to typify? Upon this part of the problem, however, little doubt exists. The presiding deity of the Thuringians, we have before said, was Thor, the Saxon equi- valent of the Roman Jupiter, the Greek Zcvs, the great thunder- god inhabiting the air, who was supposed to delight in hurling his bolts upon the earth. And hence this little effigy of the old Thuringian deity is placed in the body of the two-necked bird, symbolical of the orbs of day and night that were continually floating through the heavens. ' Such is a faithful account of the more peculiar of the articles that are still to be purchased at the stalls of the Sommer Gewinn festival in Eisenach ; and if we add that the early spring flowers \u2014 such as hyacinths, crocuses, snowbells and violets \u2014 are also sold there, as well as little baskets filled with nosegays, made out of many-coloured immortelles ; and that there are one or two petty"], [376, "360 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. gambling booths generally to be found at the fair \u2014 although it be Sunday\u2014 for the peasant boys to squander their pfennings at in the silly sport \u2014 we shall have almost exhausted this part of the subject. It should, however, be stated that drinking, and, in deed, rioting, seem to constitute now-a-days the chief attractions of the gathering; for as you push your way through the uproari ous crowd, you hear the sounds of music booming forth from the suburban taverns : and if the visitor think it worth his while, as we did, to enter the petty hostelry of the \"Angel,\" in order to have a peep at what is going on there, he will find the low and dirty little rooms of the inn filled to suffocation with Bauer-leute \u2014 all drinking beer or schnapps as hard as they can, and some of the peasant girls being treated, as a special mark of favour, by their sweethearts, to a glass of egg-punch ; while, in the farther chamber where the village girls and boys are spinning round in couples \u2014 as thick and fast as the eddies in a rapid \u2014 to the sound of a noisy blatant brass-band, he will see, in a niche in the wall, the figure of a man, nearly the size of life, dressed out in a com plete suit of the green boughs of the fir-tree ; for, as the tradition runs, it has been customary for the Thuringian folk to dance in front of such a green man at this same feast of the spring-time time out of mind."], [377, "CHAPTER XXVIII. THE FEAST OF \" SUMMERS VICTORY,\" AS FORMERLY CELEBRATED IN EISENACH. Nevertheless, those who may be incredulous as to the persist ence of such a pagan institution as that before described, in the very heart of Saxon Germany, down to the present day, may \u2014 despite the old mythical title of the festivity \u2014 rather choose to believe that the explanations above given, as to the mystic mean ing of the several symbols that are still to be purchased there, are merely high-flown conceits on the author's part ; and may be they would as soon think of connecting the tavern-sign of the \" Goose and Gridiron,\" or \" Cat and Fiddle\" with some ancient mystery as they would dream of associating that of the \" Swan with Two Necks\" with the petty pith tokens that are still sold in Eisenach under the name of \" Holy Ghosts.\" But when we come to relate what were the ceremonies carried on at this same feast of the spring-time, even within the memory of those still living in the town, we are satisfied all such doubts will cease, and that then the most sceptical or bigoted reader \u2014 for your extremes ever meet \u2014 will be forced to wonder with us at the long, tenacious preservation of this old heathen holiday. We have before said, we made it our special business, for the due unravelling of this part of the subject, to consult two of the oldest and most intelligent inhabitants in the Thuringian capital ; and from them and others we derived the greater part of the information of the now extinct ceremonies which, even within their own memory or that of their fathers, used to be connected with the spring-feast in the course of the last century. In the olden time, we were assured, it was customary for the boys and workpeople of the town to fashion the figure of a man out of a bundle of straw \u2014 after the manner of the effigy of old"], [378, "362 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Guy Fawkes that the lads of London delight to carry about on the fifth of November \u2014 and which ceremony, we are inclined to believe, is a remnant of the same old Saxon practice, to which a modern application has been given ; for we shall presently see that our \" Jack in the Green'' has its coguate custom in modern Saxony. This straw figure, or Popanz (literally, bogie), as it was called, was dressed up so as to represent the old god Thor ; but in what manner this was made out we were unable to leam \u2014 whether the deity held a bundle of brimstone matches in one hand (like the London boys' Guy Fawkes), as significant of the thunderbolts he wielded, we cannot say ; but no doubt some such rude means were adopted to express the attributes of the thunder-god. The figure was borne through the streets of the town by lads who had delighted in the manufacture of it, with a large crowd at their heels, one and all shouting with joy, and singing : \u2014 \" Old Thor we carry far away ; His grave shall be the stream to-day.\" or else the song was varied with the following couplet : \u2014 \" Old Winter's course is fairly run, Tor Summer hath the battle won.\" WThile such pagan rejoicings and rude songs were going on, it was also customary for \" wild men,\" as they were called, to go dancing and shouting through the thoroughfares, dressed from neck to foot in fir-branches, as a token that the woods were soon to be green once more, now that the terrible deity of the air had been driven from his throne. That such was the meaning of these wild men there can be no doubt, for they were merely archetypes of our own \" Jack in the Green\" at May-day ; since, it was usual, till within a few years ago, for the people of Eise nach to dress up such a green figure at Whitsuntide and to lead him through the streets with music, collecting such small coin as they could from the citizens by the way ; while others, in dresses decorated with bits of bright paper and tinsel, danced under the lindens outside the Jbrgens Thor, after the fashion of \"my lord\" and \" my lady\" of our chimney-sweepers to this time. At the same period it was customary to decorate the wooden statues of the Twelve Apostles in the Chapel of \" the Holy Ghost\" outside the George's Gate, and to range them in front of the church door, with wreaths on their heads and garlands in their"], [379, "THE OLD FEAST OF SUMMER'S VICTORY. 363 hands, for the delight and admiration of the boorish multitude. But how the Apostles came to be dragged into the pagan cere- mony it is difficult to determine, unless by supposing that formerly this same chapel of the Holy Ghost was the temple in which many of the pagan Saxon idols, such as Eostre, Hirminsul, Crodus, Eckardt, Holle, and others, were wont to be tricked out in a similar manner at such times ; and that after the introduction of Christianity the Catholic priests substituted the figures of the Apostles for those of the obsolete heathen gods \u2014 in the same way as they transformed the god of the whirlpool (German, Gewirr) into St. Goar \u2014 pronounced Go-war \u2014 and changed him into a hermit living in a grotto and teaching Christianity for the first time to the fishermen on the Rhine ; for such, it is well known, were the \"pious frauds\" with which the early Fathers delighted to impose upon the vulgar. While these festivities connected with the mythic burial of the old god Thor were going on in Eisenach, the exterior of the houses were mostly decorated wih fir-branches hung with garlands of gaudily-coloured eggs and even live snails (though why snails should have been introduced we are at a loss to conjecture) ; while at the top of such branches there invariably dangled one of the pith birds with two necks before described, and which, at the present time, are known only by the name of \" Holy Ghosts.\" This custom of decorating the houses with green boughs at the commencement of the vernal season continued down to within ten years of the present day ; and it is questionable whether the Fete Dieu of Catholic countries \u2014 which occurs at the beginning of the month of June \u2014 is not the remains of the same old pagan custom of welcoming in the summer, and burying the corpse of the dead god of the winter-time. We happened to be resident in Coblenz during one of these festivities, and there we saw the streets strewn with flowers, the houses covered with green leaves and boughs up to the first floor windows, and altars set up in all the public places, for prayers to be offered up there by the high priest, who walked under the silken canopy, called the \" heaven,\" that is used only on such occasions ; while the figures of the Virgin Mary that were set in glass cases at the corner of almost every thoroughfare in the town were newly decked out in white muslin and flower garlands for the feast. And when we asked what Christian ceremony all this pomp and parade was meant to celebrate, the only answer which we got was that it was the Leichnams-fest (literally, the dead-body feast); and until we came"], [380, "364 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to Thuringia and heard of these same old heathen rejoicings over the burial of the corpse of Thor, the god of the winter-time, we could never, for the life of us, comprehend what was the meaning of that empty Catholic parade. Towards the close of the ancient Thuringian feast, it was usual to carry the straw effigy of the defunct pagan deity down to the banks of the Horsel, and there to cast the bogie into the stream, amidst shouts of the wildest joy and boorish cheers ; and when the dusk drew in, a burning wheel that had been previously coated with pitch, and to which another such Popanz, or old bogie, made of straw, was attached, was sent rolling down a-flame from the summit of the mountain called the Madelstein (literally, the Maidens stone) into the very midst of the crowd who were assembled below in the \"fore-town\" to witness and exult over this exciting part of the ceremony. Now, time out of mind, such a burning wheel has been oue of the symbols by which the fiery chariot of the sun was mythically represented ; so that, taking this part of the festivities in con nection with the others previously mentioned, surely none can be found ready to dispute that the token was meant to signify that the heathen god of the winter was now about to be con sumed by the heat of the approaching summer's sun. Of these pagan festivities there are, unfortunately, but few records to be found in the chronicles of Thuringia ; and even in the latest \" Topographical and Historical Description of the Town of Eisenach,\" by Johann Wilhelm Storch, we have merely the following brief account: \u2014 \" An old custom (Sommergewinn), the origin of which is not to be discovered, and which may have its source in heathen practices, remains still to be mentioned. It is highly possible,\" says the author, \" that, as the name implies, the ancient custom was designed to celebrate the end of winter and the beginning of summer, This feast was always held, on the Suuday called L\u0153tare, in the long fore-town outside the George's Gate, where booths were erected for the sale of confectionery, cakes, and toys. A large multitude of the citizens, with their children, visited, in the afternoon of this day, their friends and acquaintances dwelling in that part of the town for the purposes of enjoyment and purchasing fir-boughs decorated with sweet meats, toys, and other fancy articles. Laden with these same decorated boughs, to which the name of \" summer\" was given, they returned towards evening, with their joyful children, to their houses. Formerly, far different customs have been known to be"], [381, "THE OLD FEAST OF SUMMERS VICTORY. 365 connected with this feast. The grown-up lads then were wont to make a wheel, to which a Popanz, or figure of straw, was fas tened, and to let this run burning down from the top of the Madelstein into the ' fore-town.' In the Lausitzer and Meiss nischen countries, it was customary in many places,\" adds the writer, in a note, \" to carry round such a dressed-up straw man with song and rejoicing on this so-called Dead Sunday, or L\u0153tare, aud then to cast the figure into the water. Further, the same youths were wont to set up a peeled fir-pole, hung with boughs, that was decorated with ribbons and scarfs at the top, in one of the open places in the ' fore-town,' and this the lads had to climb in order to get possession of the prizes at the summit. These dangerous practices, hewever, led to so many evils and accidents that they have long since been prohibited by the authorities of the city.\" \u2014 Topographische-Historische Beschreibung der Stadt Eisenach, pp. 210, 211. At the same time as the burning wheel was sent rolling down the steep sides of the Madelstein hill, the Johannis-feuer was lighted on every hill-top round about. This Johannis, or John's fire, was literally the summer's-fire ; for what we call Midsum mer-day goes by the name of Johannistag in Germany ; even as the beautiful little fire-flies that flit about in the woods of Thurin gia at nightfall during the hot weather like so many winged gems of the brightest colours, are termed Johannis-wurme. \" The so called Johannis-fire,\" says the authority above quoted, \" which was burnt on the hills at the feast of the Sommer-gewinn, may, like the other customs usual on that day, have been the remains of the old Sorbish paganism.\" \u2014 Top.-Hist. der Stadt Eisenach, p. 211. In the older Thuringian chronicles we find no mention of the customs common at this feast, and indeed, there is little or no book-knowledge to be gained upon the subject. The only written account that we have been able to lay our hands upon, is that given in the curious collection of modern and ancient practices, known as \" Hone's Every-Day Book,\" and, in which, so far as our information goes, there appear to be many inaccuracies ; for though the title of \" Summer's Victory,\" which the feast retains to this day, would seem to imply that in the olden time some such battle as is mentioned in Hone's book was in former times enacted tor the sport of the attendants at the festival, we have been unable to hear of any such tradition even among the oldest inhabitants of the city ; and after our inquiries into the matter, we are disposed"], [382, "366 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. to believe that the title \"victory \" was meant to refer more to the metaphorical strife of the elements than to any actual encounter represented by mummers at this season of the year. Nor would this account of the old heathen festivities that were wont to be held in almost every country in the olden time be complete without reminding the reader of the practices common at the same season, in the early days of the Catholic church ; for we know that on the introduction of Christianity into Pagan countries, it was the wont of the priests of old to transform the holidays, to which they found the people attached, beyond the power of weaning, into festivities of a pseudo-Christian character ; so that it is a matter of history that, at this same Easter-tide, even the preachers themselves were wont to indulge in all kinds of buffoonery in the pulpit, merely with the view of contributing to the merriment which the old heathen folk had always associated with the spring-time of the year. For Hagenbach, in his \"Lec- tures upon the Reformation,\" assures us that the Easter laughter (Oster geldehter) common in the Catholic pulpits after Lent, was specially characteristic of the period preceding the Reforma- tion. And \u0152colampadius, who was an eye-witness of these bar- barous desecrations, tells us, in his \" De Risu Paschali,\" there were preachers who, to raise a laugh among their hearers at this season, imitated the sounds of animals during their sermon. One cried like a cuckoo, another cackled like a goose, aud another narrated the legend of the Holy Petrus, while a fourth, in order to create no end of fun out of the tale, recounted how the keeper of the gates of Heaven had, in a tavern, cheated the landlord of his reckoning. Other preachers resorted to all kinds of vulgar and obscene jokes ; so that, according to the same authority, earnest-minded Christians were constrained to keep away from the Churches at this time, so as not to be offended by the ribaldry, whilst others who went thither, were forced to quit the edifice for very shame and anger. The legend of the Holy Peter here re-\" ferred to, which was extremely popular among the funny preachers of the Middle Ages, during the sanctioned church-merriment at the Easter feast, was to the following effect: \u2014 The figure of the holy St. Peter, disguised as a beggar, appeared before a knight named Brother Lustig, and solicited alms from him. The good natured kuight shared his last pfenning with him, and, by such means, obtained a claim upon the good wishes of the Apostle, as well as the mercy of Heaven. After this the knight lived the"], [383, "THB OLD FEAST OF SUMMER'S VICTORY. 367 sime life of pleasure as his name Lustig signifies, and gave him self up to all kinds of sin ; for, to save him from the possibility of want in the future, Peter, in return for his charity, had given him a travelling pouch, telling him that whatever he wished to have in it, the bag should immediately be found to contain. In a few years, however, Lustig died, and came to sue for admission at the gates of Heaven, and then Peter bade him begone on account of his sins. \" Well,\" says the knight, \" if you will not let me in, do you take back your bag, for I do not wish to have anything belonging to you.\" Thereupon Peter lays hold of the pouch and hangs it upon the back of his chair ; and no sooner has he done this than the cunning knight cries \" I wish that I was inside that bag,\" and \"Husch!\" (says the old German story) \"he was immediately transported to the interior of the sack, and sat in Heaven for ever afterwards ; for the holy Peter had no power to turn him out when once within the gates.\" \u2014 Die Grafschaft Mans field in the old Beformation time, by the Bev. K. Erumhaar, Pastor of Helbra, p. 37. Moreover, we are assured in the work last quoted, that over the organ in the Cathedral of Strasburg, there was formerly a gro tesque figure, which was called the \"roaring ape;\" and behind this, it was the custom of the more lively journeymen of the city to hide themselves during the spring festivities, and to delight the multitude either by their howling, or else by their coarse wit and merry songs. \u2014 Idem, p. 32. The Easter comedies, again, which were sanctioned by the Catholic Church at the same season of the year, all tend to show that these same pseudo-Christian customs of the Middle Ages were but the remains of the old heathen rejoicings which at one time prevailed, in almost every land, at the commencement of spring, and the consequent termination of winter ; for what con nection the merry-making could possibly have with Christianity, and especially at a time commemorative of the Crucifixion of the \u25a0Saviour, it is beyond human reason to conceive ; so that there is no other way left for us to explain the introduction of such revelry into the rites of the Romish Church, than by assuming that it was the relic of the old heathen forms and ceremonies \u2014 such as we obtain a glimpse of, even to this day, in the feast of the Sommer Gewinn at Eisenach. One other curious point has to be mentioned, and then we have exhausted our present theme. We have before stated how the people on the sunny side of the street leading to the George's"], [384, "368 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Gate are allowed the privilege of selling all kinds of \" bakework\" \u2014 that is to say, sweetmeats as well as biscuits, &c. (for the com prehensive German term includes confectionery as well as cakes), at the time of the spring festival, in return for the eggs they were formerly bound to give to the monks during Lent. The same practice of forced contribution by the citizens to the several monasteries and nunneries throughout the town would appear to have prevailed also in other parts of Eisenach ; for to this day a certain proportion of the taxes levied upon every house consists of what are termed \" cock and hen or geese taxes,\" as the case may be ; and though such imposts are now never paid in kind, a certain equivalent sum of money has to be given in lieu of them. True, the monasteries have long since been abolished ; and though Catholicism has disappeared, the burdens which it imposed upon the people still remain, and go to swell the revenue of his Pro testant Royal Highness the Grand Duke. One house has to pay 20 groschens (or 2s.) a-year to his Serenissimus instead of a couple of geese which the fat Fathers of the Church formerly claimed from the proprietors of the dwelling. Another person whom we knew had to give as many times 2J pence as his house had been destined to supply cocks and hens to the Mendicant Friars in the course of the year. So again, at the feast of Martinmas, or Michaelmas as we call it, it was customary in the olden times for the villagers to bring to the priest offerings of geese and cakes ; but though the mass in honour of St. Martin or St. Michael has passed away, the parsons still expect the same toll ; for it is far more easy to reform a creed than to put an end to the plunder which was formerly connected with it. While speaking of these goose-days, it may be as well to men tion that the anecdote which refers the custom with us of eating roast goose at Michaelmas-day to the circumstance of such a dish having constituted the dinner of Queen Elizabeth, when the news of the destruction of the Spanish Armada arrived in England, has not the least foundation in fact ; since the dish is as generally partaken of in Saxony at the same season of the year, and we cannot possibly suppose that the conquest of the Spanish fleet could in any way have influenced the Germans in their choice of such food at such a period. Moreover, the story is current in Thuringia that the reahon why Gdnsebraten (baked goose) forms the staple food of the Lutherans at Martinmas is, because the great German Reformer, while visiting Nordhausen"], [385, "THE OLD FEAST OF SUMMER'S VICTORY. 369 in secret (at the time his catholic persecutors were in quest of him), entered the house of a shoe-maker in that town, and was feasted with the same dish by the son of Crispin gratuitously ; whereupon Martin Luther is said to have made it a rule ever after to eat the same food on the same day, and his followers to have observed the custom after him. Moreover, we are assured that so general is the belief in this tradition in Nordhausen, that any stranger who visits that city on the day of St. Martin can claim, as a right, a dish of roast goose of any of the inhabitants. Now these two opposite reasons assigned for the same event, prove to our mind that there is no truth in either ; and that the custom arose, more probably, from the peasants having to pre sent each a certain number of geese to the heads of the Church at this particular season of the year \u2014 a practice which doubt lessly led to the pastors being overwhelmed with such a multitude of these birds that they were glad to get rid of them for the smallest-possible sum of money; and hence, the savoury food, being cheaper then than at any other time, came to be generally partaken of at that period. \" The holy Martin,'' says the Rev. K. Krumhaar, in his \"History of the Countship of Mansfeld at the Time of the Reformation,\" \" was der Lieblings-heilige \u2014 the beloved saint of Thuringia. The Martin's feast, however,\" he adds, \"has ceased, but the Martin's geese and the Martin's Hornchen (little rolls of white bread, made in tbe form of cres cents) still remain among us.\" \u2014 (P. 39.) 24"], [386, "CHAPTER XXIX. THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEGENDS. These, like most of the old traditional tales in connection with places of special interest are generally of an historic, mythic, elfin, or miraculous character. The historical stories are mostly simple narratives of the events which have occurred at some particular spot in connection with the family of some one of the old Landgraves or dukes of Thuringia. Of this class of legend the story of the \" Stolen Princes \" (given hereafter), as well as that of \" Frederick with the Bitten Cheek,\" may be cited as average examples. The mythic legends, on the other hand, are mostly crude Teu tonic versions of the elegant Grecian and Roman fables \u2014 as in the celebrated tradition of the \" Loves of the minstrel Taun haiiser and the enchantress Venus.\" The Thuringians, indeed, to this day seem to have the same faith in the existence of the hero of the Pagan parable as their forefathers, or the Romans of old, had in the reality of the thunder-god Jupiter, or Thor ; for on the wall of the \" Sangersaal \" (singers'-hall) at the Wartburg, there is a large fresco recently painted, in which the said Tann hauser is represented as a foxy German troubadour taking part in the famous \" Singers' Contest.\" The elfin legends again are of various kinds, and, more or less, peculiar to the country. Many of them are mere nursery tales about the doings of \" Nixes ' or water sprites, in whose existence the ancient Germans appear to have had a devout belief. Others are stories of Eilkropffs, or devil's changelings, as they were called, in which Martin Luther himself had no slight faith \u2014 though these same kilkropffs, so far as we can make out, seem to have been nothing but wretched little ugly children with inordi nate appetites."], [387, "371 THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEGENDS. Here, for instance, is a story which the great German Re former tells, in all gravity, concerning one of these Wechsel-bdlije, and which, assuredly, no old washer-woman of the present day would venture to narrate. \" In Saxony, not far from Halberstadt, there was a man who had one of these kilkropffs in his house, This demon-child could exhaust at one meal the whole of his supposed mother's milk, and that of five other women ; and would devour, besides, whatever was presented to it. The man was advised to take the child a pilgrimage to Holschelstadt to the shrine of the Virgin there, so that he might dedicate it to the Blessed Mother of God, and leave it, to be nursed in the immediate vicinity. The pea sant, adopting the advice, was on the way to the shrine, carrying the child in a basket, when, on passing a bridge, another devil, in the water below \u2014 a Nix\u2014 cried out ' Kilkropff ; kilkropff!' The child in the basket (who, until that moment, had never said a single word) replied, ' Oh ! oh ! oh ! ' The devil in the river continued, ' Whither art thou going ?' The one in the basket replied ' Oh ! oh ! I'm going to the Blessed Mother of God, at Holschelstadt, to be nursed.' The countryman, aghast at this dialogue, threw the basket and child into the river, and imme diately two devils rose from the water, and flew through the air, crying, ' Oh ! oh ! oh ! ' and turning one over another, in sportive mockery of the countryman.\" \"The devil,\" says Martin Luther again, \"delights to steal human children ; and it is by no means unfrequent for him to carry away infants within the first six weeks after their birth, and to substitute in their place imps, called in Latin supposititii, and by the Saxons, Kilkropff. Eight years ago, I myself saw, at Dessau, a child of this sort, which had no human parents, but had proceeded from the devil. He was twelve years old, and in outward form exactly resembled ordinary children. He did no thing but eat, devouring as much every day as four hearty labourers or threshers could. In most external respects he was, as I have said, just like other children ; but if any one touched him, he yelled out like a mad creature, and with a pecu liar sort of scream. Whenever anything went wrong in the house, if there was any misfortune or accident, he would dance about and shout for joy ; but when, on the other hand, matters proceeded smoothly, he was always weeping. I said to the Princes of Anhalt, with whom I was staying at the time,\" con tinues the Reformer, \" I would have the child thrown into the"], [388, "372 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Moklau, at the risk of being held its murderer. But the Elector of Saxony and the Princes were not of my opinion in the matter. I then told them to have prayers, at all events, offered up in the churches to God, that He would be pleased to remove the demon. Prayers to that effect were accordingly said every day for a year, and at the end of this time the child died.\" When Martin Luther had finished relating the above story to some friends, some one, he tells us, asked him \"How he could have made up his mind to advise that the child should be cast into the river?\" \" Why,\" he replied, \" children like that are, in my opinion, a mere mass of flesh and bone, without any soul. The devil is quite capable of producing such things; just in the same way as he annihilates the faculties of men, when he possesses them cor- poreally so as to deprive them of reason, and render them men- tally blind and deaf for a period\u2014 just in the same way, I say, does he inhabit these masses of flesh, which seem to us children, but of which he himself is the soul, and the only soul they have. How often too,\" he says, \" have the demons called ' Nixes ' drawn women and girls into the water, and there had commerce with them, with like fearful consequences \u2014 the result being generally an imp of darkness, half-mortal, half-demon. \u2014 \"Luther's Table Talk, p. 216. These \"Nixes\" or water-demons (about whom the great German Reformer discourses so knowingly), seem to have been merely a grim goblin form of the more graceful Grecian Naiades, and of even the celebrated German river nymphs, Undine and Lurlei, the legends concerning whom are known all over the world. Besides the above kind of lore, there are legends concerning the \" Kobolds,\" or goblins of the mines, who are said to derive their name from the Latin cobalus, a spirit that was supposed to thwart the labours of miners by exciting false hopes, and render- ing their work fruitless. Mathesius, in his tenth sermon, speak- ing of the ore called cadmia fossilis, says, \"Ye miners call it 'cobalt,' the Germans denominate it the 'black devil,' and the ' devil's hag,' the old and black ' kobel,' which by witchcraft do injury to people and to their cattle.\" Indeed, so general was the belief in Germany as to the evil doings of these goblins of the mines, that Beckmann, in his \" History of Inventions,\" tells us it was once customary in that country to introduce into the Church service a pra; er that God would preserve miners and their works from kobolds and the like evil spirits."], [389, "373 THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEGENDS. Than, again, we have Sagen (legends) concerning the Wichtel mdnnchen, or Puck-like pigmies, who lived under the ground, and for whom the housewives were in the habit of placing food in dishes on certain nights of the year, lest in case of their omit ting to do so, the \"little men\" should break all the crockery out of spite at the neglect. Many are the traditions concerning the doings of this tiny goblin tribe among the Thuringian and Werra peasants ; some telling how the little folk delighted to hide them selves in the butter-tubs, and abscond with a good part of the contents in the night ; and others how they had sometimes taken up their dwelling underneath some stable, whereupon every hor-e that entered the place was sure to die in a few weeks \u2014 for the puny creatures are said to have had a special aversion to team sters of all kinds ; and how, too, the little round fossils, which are to this day found in the neighbourhood of the Brandenburg, constituted the pence which they delighted to gamble for among the rocks. Another peculiar story illustrative of the character of these Wkhtel-mdnnchen is one in which we are told how a certain poor ferry-man, on the banks of the Werra, was once hailed, while waiting for a freight, by two little men no bigger than one's forefinger, who were dressed in long cloaks about the size of the extinguishers to wax tapers, and asked by them whether he wanted a job. On the ferry-man answering that he was always glad to have work, the mannikins sprang into the boat, and when the boatman had taken his seat he could feel the punt sinking lower and lower, as if the gunwale were being gradually forced down to the water's edge by some heavy load ; but though it was broad daylight he could see nothing but the two little people who had originally accosted him. Presently he was told to push off, and make the best of his way to the opposite shore ; and when he had reached the bank on the other -side the gunwale of the boat began to rise up slowly above the water's level, as if some heavy freight were being as slowly removed from it. Whereupon the boatman, who now knew that his craft was once more emptied of its invisible cargo, was ordered by the two little \" hop o' my thumb \" gentlemen to make his way back and bring over a similar elfin burden. Nor was it until the crossing of the stream had been repeated some half-dozen times that the boatman had any knowledge of what he had been engaged to carry. For then he was told, if he wished to see the freight he had brought over, he was to look over his left shoulder ; and immediately on so doing he beheld the grass swarming with thousands of little human"], [390, "374 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. beings hardly bigger than May-bugs, and the meadow glittering with the bright colour of their dresses, as though it was dappled all over with buttercups, snowdrops, and violets ; while every one of the little things was laden with some tiny cooking vessel \u2014 some bearing silver frying-pans no bigger than spangles, others carrying copper saucepans about the size of a percussion cap, and others gilt kettles hardly larger than gold-beads \u2014 all on their way for a day's feast and merry-making in the woods. \"What reward would the ferry-man wish?\" asked the little head of the elfin tribe: \"would he be paid in money or salt?\" But the boatman knew that the Wichtel-pfenninge, or goblin money, con- sisted merely of little flat round bits of stone, so he said he preferred the latter form of remuneration. Whereupon he was directed to recross the river, and enter one of the caverns in the rock hard by, where he found pillar after pillar of salt as bright and clear as crystal, and which, in those days, when the savoury condiment was as dear as sugar, brought the poor ferry-man many a hundred of golden ducats for his day's labour. Another class of Thuringian legends consists of those wild tales of diablerie which the German ballads and story-books have made popular among the literature of almost every country. Of course, tales of the wild huntsman form a large share of the legendary lore of Thuringia; for we are told that whenever a storm rages at night, the demon \"Jager\" sallies forth with his spectral crew from the Horsel Mountains, some of them having their faces turned to their backs, and all being mounted upon three-legged steeds, and followed by biped dogs that are half birds, half blood-hounds. Then there are grim fables about the Frau Holle, the goddess of death, telling you how she wanders through the country at certain seasons, rewarding the good spin- ners, and threatening with the pangs of purgatory those who have been idle or careless over their work ; and how when the snow falls thick and fast, the dark old bag is shaking out her feather- bed from the tops of the hills, and eager for the death of other birds so that she may rest with ease on her stony bed at nioht. Then -there are the Morz-menschen (literally the death-folk) concerning whom, though no legend exists at the present day, a custom still prevails, which is quaintly typical of the ancient religious notions prevalent among the Thuringian peasants, as to. the perils of the winter time. In the first week in November it has long been, and still is, the mode in the different forest villages for the boys to dress up in masks, and with one of the party dis-"], [391, "375 THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEGENDS. guised as an old woman, to visit the various houses in the com- munity, on entering which they proceed to throw apples and sweetmeats on the floor for the good children. These the old crone, who is the representative of the Frau Holle, the death deity, endeavours to appropriate to herself, while the attendant mummers belabour the hag with their cudgels, to the great delight of the little ones present on the occasion. After this peculiar ceremony has been gone through, the old woman draws a sack from under her arm, and inquires if there are any naughty children in the establishment, saying, \" If there be, she has come to carry them away with her to the Horsel hills, never to see their parents again;\" whereupon the crew are generally informed that none but good boys and girls are to be found in that family ; and accordingly the Morz-menschen take their departure to visit some other house in the neighbourhood. As at present con- ducted, the ceremony is stripped of almost all meaning, and in- deed, you may question many a Eisenacher, who is unversed in the pagan antecedents of his country, and get only an innocent shrug of the shoulders by way of an answer ; for now the mode is, merely for the mummers to appear in unmeaning masquerade, and to scatter bon-bons on the floor \u2014 the fashion being, that those whose disguises are detected shall remain to pass the even- ing with the family who have recognised them through their masks. We happened to see the pantomime, however, performed in the primitive Httle village of Mohra, and we have described it as there enacted, adding such elucidatory details, obtained from the old chronicles, as will enable the reader to comprehend the meaning of the mystery. In Thuringia, again, every other nook in the rocks goes by the name of the \" Devil's Pulpit,\" and there are grave records as to how the old gentleman preached at the spot to crowds of gaping peasants, making converts of them all ; till the Holy St. Boni- face made his appearance on some neighbouring stone, and, re- futing all the Evil One's arguments, sent him off howling through the air, followed by the most vivid crash and flash of thunder and lightning ever heard in the neighbourhood. Moreover, there are \" Devil's Caves \" and \"Virgin's Caverns \" without number; and connected with one of the latter there is a curious tradition that a young girl is imprisoned in the recesses of the mountain, and that whoever shall hear her give seven sneezes, and will be good enough to cry \" God bless you ! \" after each, for the same number of times, will be the means of liberating the poor damsel."], [392, "376 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Further, the Werra and the Thuringian chronicles teem with duly-authenticated ghost-stories without end \u2014 one of these being to the effect that a naughty nun, who was frail enough to elope from her cloister with some gool-looking scapegrace of a knight, has been doomed ever since her death to pace the meadows in the neighbourhood of Gerstungen so many times by night every seven years ; and that she is still to be seen at the appointed period walking about the fields, clad in grey, her hair streaming down her back, and with a heavy bunch of keys attached to the hempen girdle around her waist. Whoever has courage enough to seize the phantom nun, we are gravely told, and carry her to the Gerstungen market-place, will be the means of absolving her from the penance. As yet, however, none have been found bold enough for the feat, though the figure, we are informed, was seen but a few years back by a butcher of the name of Martin, who died \" grass-green\" shortly after encountering the apparition : the said unhappy butcher, moreover, having been the cousin of a needlewoman resident in Eisenach, who assured the members of our own family that she herself could vouch for the truth of the narrative. Of witch-stories, on the other hand, it is but natural to sup pose that the chronicles of so primitive a country as Thuringia \u2014 a large part of which consists of forest land, even to the present day \u2014 should contain a vast store. Indeed, it is a popular belief among the peasants of the present day, that on Walpurgis-nacht (May-day night) all the witches in the country are wont to assemble on the summit of the Blocksberg, a mountain situate in the Hartz, on the frontiers of Thuringia and Brunswick, and which can be seen sixteen miles off. Thither, you are told, the witches and sorcerers throughout the whole Thuringian district are in the habit of riding, at midnight on the first of May, through the air on broom-sticks, oven forks (Ofen-gabeln), and he-goats, and that when they have reached the mountain-top, they hold a feast there with the devil \u2014 the entire assembly dancing through the night, along with his Satanic majesty, round about a young buck. In fine, so general is the belief among the boors in this kind of supernatural agency, that those spasmodic or rheumatic affections of the muscles of the neck or back \u2014 affections which we term \" crick,\" or lumbago \u2014 the Thuringians are in the habit of denominating Hexen-schusse (witch-shots), under the impression that the darts of witchcraft alone can account for their sudden imposition."], [393, "377 THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEGENDS. Many of the stories, too, refer to the superstitious observance of Sglvester-nacht (New Year's Eve) ; for on that occasion it is still customary, even in the houses of the citizens, to pour molten lead into a bowl of water, in order to discover, by the forms taken by the little clots of solidified metal, what are to be the fortunes of the assembled company throughout the year. In order that the charm should be properly worked, it is necessary, we were assured, that the bowl containing the water should be one that some person present has received as an heir-loom from their grandfather, and that the key through which the molten metal has to be poured should be an Erb-schSssel, as it is called \u2014 that is to say, a key which has been in the possession of the family for many generations. On such occasions it is by no means uncommon for the drops of liquid metal, on falling into the water, to assume the form of hob-nails \u2014 a sitm which is said to foreshadow that some of the young ladies present are to have shoemakers for their bridegrooms before the expiration of the year. Sometimes, too, the fragments of the suddenly-cooled lead are found to bear a rude resemblance to cow-s, aud this is said to denote a marriage with a farmer or cowherd. Another custom on the same evening is, as we have before said, for the girls in the town to fetch water at midnight from the nearest running spring, and to bring it home without speaking a word by the way, it being generally believed that, provided all the injunctions are strictly carried out, the damsels who wash their faces in the liquid thus obtained will be rewarded with fair complexions and rosy cheeks for the remainder of the year. Nor should we omit to add, that it is the special delight of the roguish boys on such occasions to hide themselves in the neighbourhood of the brooks which are most generally resorted to for this purpose, and to rush out in the darkness of the night upon the girls as they are dipping their pails into the stream, so that the scream which the startled maideus are sure to utter in their alarm may be the means of breaking the spell. Indeed, New Year's Eve in Thuringia is still one of the most festive times throughout the year. Hardly a person then \u2014 not even the youngest child \u2014 thinks of going to bed until they have heard the clock strike twelve ; and in the town of Eisenach, where there is scarcely a light to be seen in a house on other nights after the hour of ten, (for to this day is observed there the old curfew practice of the night-watch bidding the citizens at that hour in doggrel rhymes to"], [394, "378 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. \" Put out each fire and douse each hght, So that no harm the town affright. And praise ye God the Lord,\") it is curious to observe how on Sylvester-night every window pane shines like a sheet of gold with the lamps within, and to see the heads thrust out of the casements as the time draws near for the midnight chimes. Then, as the clock of St. Nicholas and St. George are heard to boom forth the hour of twelve, everybody suddenly starts up to shake hands with everybody ; while little children and grown men rush out into the streets, crying aloud, some as if shouting through a speaking trumpet, and others in the shrillest and yet prettiest infantine treble, \" Prosit New Jahr!\" (Bless you on the New Year!) Then imme diately afterwards all the bells of the churches in the town begin to ring out the merriest and loudest peal, while the streets are all agog, as though it were a \"year-market's day,\" rather than the middle of the night. The first day of the New Year is to the Thuringian people what Boxing-day is to us ; for then the houses are beset by gang after gang of the poorer classes, who come to wish you a blessing, in the hope of getting a few pfennings in exchange. Almost every ring at the bell (for remember there are no street-doors and no kuockers in Eisenach) proceeds from some such begging wandering tribe ; and immediately the summons has been an swered the mendicant troop push their way into your Vorsaal (literally, the fore-hall, leading to the chambers on every flat \u2014 there is no equivalent English word for it), and begin to shout out at the top of their voices : \u2014 \" Greet we the household for the Tsew Tear! Union, peace, and health, and everlasting happiness to you all ! Not alone for this year, But for many years to come, So praise God the Lord ! \" Another peculiar traditional custom of Thuringia is observed by the girls on the night of St. Andreas, which occurs on the last day of November ; for it is believed that on that night any damsel who retires to bed invoking the aid of the patron saint previous to putting her head upon her pillow, will be sure to see in her dreams the apparition of the swain to whom she is destined sooner or later to be united. Accordingly, it is tbe wont of the lasses in and round about Eisenach to chant certain"], [395, "THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEGENDS. 379 verses to their Schutz-patron (guardian angel), of which the following may be given as a free translation .\u2014 \" Andreas ! Pandreas ! Of maidens the heavenly patron, Oh ! gladden my sight With a glimpse on this night Of the man who's to make me a matron. Cause his form to appear ; Let me look on the dear, As he dangles and jangles the gold in his purse ! He'll say, too, perhaps, What time must elapse Ere he'll share it all with me for better or worse; Nor is the charm complete until the maiden, on covering her self with her feather-bed, has kicked the bed-board three times at least ; after which, we have been credibly informed that many a future husband has been discovered \u2014 as distinctly as by the casting of the molten lead itself. Finally, a large class of the Thuringian legends is made up of those religious fairy-tales with which the Catholics of old de lighted to store the annals of the early Christian Church. Everybody is acquainted with the Papal legend of St. Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Virgins. We all know how the saint is said to have been the unmarried daughter of a Cornish king named Dioneth Maur (literally, Dioneth the Great), who, history tells us, never reigned at the period referred to in the legend. We all know, too, that this so-called Princess Ursula is said to have set out with eleven thousand young Cornish girls, in a fleet of ships, on a voyage up the Rhine, on their way to the holy city, to visit Pope Cyriacus \u2014 a Pontiff, who, history likewise teaches us, never occupied the chair of St. Peter. It is further well-known to all how the whole of this same virgin band is said to have been slaughtered on its way home from Rome by a barbarian horde from the East, who encountered it at Koln, where the entire eleven thousand skulls are to be seen to this day \u2014 some gilt, others silvered, aud others adorned with em broidered and jewelled mouthpieces \u2014 like Turkish yashmaks \u2014 in the Church there, dedicated to Saint Ursula herself. It requires, however, some little knowledge as to the mode in which these early legends of the Church were generally framed, to be able to find a key to the mystery. The greater part of the mythological fables of every country, we say again, are merely"], [396, "380 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. stories of the heavenly bodies, or of the seasons, told as if they were the movements of living divine beings. The planets, Mer cury,-Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, and Mars were all personified, and their courses respectively chronicled, as though they were the actions of so many intelligent creatures ; Mars, from his fiery colour being made the god of war and slaughter \u2014 Mercury, from the rapidity of his course, the messenger of the gods, and the presiding deity of thieves \u2014 Venus, owing to her occasionally appearing as the evening star, being fabled to have risen from the froth of the sea, and to be the goddess of love and beauty \u2014 Jupiter, on account of his greater distance from the earth, typi fied as being the presiding deity of the air, and the god of thunder and lightning ; while Saturn, because he was the farthest removed of all the then known planets, was made the god of Time \u2014 of Time, the great Creator, as well as Destroyer of all things. In like manner, the sun was represented as the god of music, because the warbling of the birds always accompanied his advent ; even as the Moon was personified as the goddess of hunting,' on account not only of her bow, but because of such ex peditions having been generally performed in the night, when the beasts of prey were mostly abroad. So, too, the story of St. Ursula is nothing more than the story of the Little Bear (for the lady's name is but the Latin title of the constellation) ; a constel lation which never sets ; while the eleven thousand virgins are merely typical of the host of attendant stars which, in the course of their revolution, would have appeared to the people on the Rhine to have come up from England, and to have travelled towards Rome iii the south, and on their return from that quarter, to have been utterly extinguished by the light of the east, which in the fable is represented as a barbarian horde, coming from that direction. In the same manner, the Catholic legend of St. Goar (pro nounced Go-war), who is represented as having been a hermit resident in a grotto near the Lurlei rock, and the first to teach the Pagan boatmen in the neighbourhood the truths of Christian ity ; and who, to prove his divinity, is said to have performed the astounding miracle of hanging his cloak upon a sunbeam \u2014 this legend becomes extremely simple when we understand that the name of the saint is merely a corruption of the German word Gewirr, which signifies any confusion or mingle-mangle, such as is found to exist among the conflicting currents of the Rhine at this point. So that the name of Gewirr or Go-war was probably"], [397, "381 THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEGENDS. merely the title given to the pagan god of the rapids there, who was supposed to inhabit the caverns at the bottom of the river, and whose form was said to be mantled by the mist which seems always to hang on the sunbeams at this part of the stream. To this day it is the custom of the simple raftsmen on the Rhine to doff their caps and pray for help on passing any such dangerous locality ; and the priests of old, having found that the god of the rapids by the Lurlei was held in special reverence by the simple people thereabouts, did not fail to transform the Pagan idol into a Christian hermit, and to hold him up as the first preacher of the new commandment to the boatmen aud fishermen living in the neighbourhood. It will be seen hereafter, too, by the legends given in the fol lowing pages, that even the Thuringian myth of Tannhauser and Venus has had such a miraculous papal transformation introduced into it ; and that a Pope Urban \u2014 who never lived at the time when the \" Singers' Contest \" at the Wartburg is said to have taken place \u2014 is made to denounce the minstrel knight on account of his sinful dalliance with the enchantress Venus, telling him that there was no more chance of his salvation than there was of the peeled osier wand, which he then carried in his hand, budding and putting forth leaves within three days. Ou the third day, however, to the great astonishment of the so-called Vicar of the Almighty, the bare, barked rod began to sprout, we are gravely informed ; whereupon his repentant Holiness sent out messengers to every quarter of the earth to seek the accursed Minnesdnger, and to tell him of -his forgiveness. But though each part of the globe was searched, the minstrel was nowhere to be found, and the trumpery bit of religious magic, therefore, had been wrought to no purpose. In the same way with the tradition concerning the Holy Elizabeth \u2014 the young Saxon Princess who appears to have played the part of Florence Nightingale in the Middle Ages \u2014 nursing the sick and helping the poor, and being duly canonized in return \u2014 has been tampered with by the fathers of the Church ; for the priestly interpolators could not allow even the simple story of the young Landgravine's charity to pass without a \"pious fraud\" being mixed up with it. Accordingly, we are told, that when the good Elizabeth was surprised by her husband, on her way from the Wartburg, while carrying home some 1 roken victuals in her lap to distribute among the poor during the famine in Eisenach, she said, on being questioned by her lord as to what she had cot.-"], [398, "382 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. cealed under her mantle, that she had \" Merely flowers ;\" where upon her lord demanded to inspect the contents of the bundle, and lo ! it was found that the good angels who watched over her, had changed the fragments of bread and meat into roses and lilies \u2014 this being a fine Romish example of the said angel's love of truth, and a striking instance as to how the priests of old thought lying for a good object an offence at which even Heaven itself would not hesitate to connive. Another of these Pago-papal legends is to the effect that the villeins and vassals attached to one of the feudal barons in the neighbourhood of the Brandenburg were in the habit of wor shipping the Saxon deity Heerda, long after the baron himself had been converted to Christianity ; and that one day, on return ing to his domains, his lordship found that all his serfs had left their work in the fields, and were congregated together in front of the neighbouring shrine, where they were all on their knees, offering up prayers to their favourite idol. Enraged at the silly adoration of a mere block of painted and gilded wood, the baron rushed up to the altar, and with his sword cut the graven image into a thousand pieces. The seeming profanity of such an art caused the vassals and villeins to rise in a body against their master, and binding him hand aud foot, they were about to offer him up as a sacrifice to the offending deity on the spot. His lordship, however, cunningly observed to the Pagan mob, that if the idol really possessed the power they supposed, it would be able to avenge the wrong itself, by putting him to death ere many days were passed. But if, on the other haud, he was allowed to live, then it would be a proof to them how impotent such a carved log really was, either for good or evil. The test was willingly accepted by the hinds, and though they watched for many days in anxious suspense, expecting their master to be either stricken down by a thunderbolt from Heaven, or swallowed up by the rapids in the Werra, the baron lived on an unscathed life ; and the people consequently seeing the helplessness of the image they had formerly worshipped, became gradually converted to the Clnistian religion, while their master got to be known as the Baron von Heerda \u2014 a title that his descendants, who are still resident in the neighbourhood, bear to this day. The origin of such legends is due to many different causes Some, of course, are merely historical records of the romantic incidents in the lives of the old princes of the country. The"], [399, "THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEGENDS. 383 greater part, however, are merely myths, invented to account for the wondrous action of those \" imponderable agents \" and subtle powers which constitute the invisible forces for ever at work in the world about us. In the ancient pagan religion such hidden causes of the great changes produced in nature were severally personified and worshipped ; so that there came to be as many gods, almost, as there were external agencies in nature aud even iuternal passions of the soul. Not only was there a god of light ning and thunder \u2014 a god of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes \u2014 gods of the winds and storms \u2014 gods of the sea and whirlpools \u2014 gods of the seasons, of the harvest and the fruit-time \u2014 gods of light and darkness, of morning and night, of time and death ; but the whole earth, every stream and forest, was fabled to be peopled with its spirits in the shapes of dryads, naiads, and satyrs, to account even for the stirring of the leaves, the murmuring of the brooks, aud the wild sylvan tribe that inhabited the uncleared portion of the globe. While, ou the other hand, there were gods of love and beauty, and even of wealth, invented to explain those mysterious stirrings of the human heart which at the dawn of philosophic inquiry required a special invisible agent or deity to account for them. Such is the simple explanation of those tales of diablerie \u2014 of \" nixes,\" of \" kilkropffs,\" \u2014 devil's changelings, and even \" wichtel-mannchen \" and \" kobolds \" \u2014 all of which are merely the ignorant attempts of the first thinkers to solve some curious and difficult problem of nature by means of some stupid superstitious hypothesis, \u2014 a creed adopted even by the wisest men, up to within a few hundred years ago, as the only rational means of accounting for the more mysterious processes of Nature. We have seen that Martin Luther himself, who was the first to break down that mixture of paganism and fanaticism which made up the Catholic creed of the Middle Ages, did not hesitate, as he tells us, to recommend to the Saxon princes of his time \" that they should order a poor child to be thrown into the river Moldau,\" merely because \" he did nothing but eat, consuming as much every day as four hearty labourers or threshers could,\" and because the Reformer assumed therefore that he was \" a mere mass of flesh and bone, without any soul, which had proceeded from the devil.''\u2014 Table Talk, p. 216. Nor should we fail to add, that even among our own judges it is comparatively but a few year3 back that the wise Sir Matthew Hale, in condemning some poor old maniac woman to be burnt for witchcraft, entered into a learned disquisition to prove that there was no other way of"], [400, "384 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. accounting for the acts of the half-witted old crone, excepting on the assumption of direct intercommunion with the Evil One. Most of the legends of every country have some such origin as those above referred to. A large class, however, consist merely of stories, which have been invented in later years, to account for the ancient names of the places to which they refer. It is a well-known principle of etymology that foreign words which are incomprehensible to the people of a country speaking a different language, are invariably altered into the nearest possible signifi cant terms to be found in their own tongue. Thus, the old Saxon tavern sign of \" Gott ymbutes,\" the literal translation of which is \" God encompasses,\" and which, as the Saxon language became, in the course of years, lost to the English people, seemed to convey no meaning whatever to then- ears, got at length to be corrupted into the more significant title of the \" Goat in Boots.\" So again, the old Norman-french phrase of \" hobe sans choix,\" or take without choice, has come to be changed into the modern English idiom of \" Hobson's choice ;\" to explain the origin of which an absurd anecdote is generally related by would-be philo- logists. In the same manner, too, the French words c'est une outre chose, have been transformed by the vulgar of our land into \" that's another pair of shoes,\" even as the German term Hausen- blase, which, literally rendered, is \" Blase,\" the air-bladder of \" Hausen\" \u2014 the \" huso,\" or sturgeon \u2014 has come to be converted into the modern English term isinglass : a word which even the learned lexicographer, Noah Webster, tells us is derived from ice and glass ! \u2014 because of its resemblance to those two substances. This curious but natural principle of language (for the mind has an innate aversion to the use of unmeaning terms) enables us to explain many of the so-called historic legends of places ; and to prove that they have been invented, in comparatively modern times, merely to account for the local name, the original signifi- cance of which has become lost in the changes it has undergone in the course of years. Even the popular Rhenish legend of Roland and Hildegund may be shown to have had such a pseudo- nymous origin ; for there is no doubt that, owing to the ruffled state of the water at this turn of the river, it anciently bore the name of the Bollendes-ecke \u2014 from the rolling waves into which the current is there broken up \u2014 the raftsmen, indeed, being in the habit to this day of baring their head and crying for Gottes-hiilfe (God's help) on nearing this dangerous part of the stream. In the course of time, that love of stenoepy which induces mankind"], [401, "385 THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LEGENDS. to clip words of their fair proportions, and to change e7rio-Kcm-os into bishop, and Eboriacum into York, even as the modems abbreviate omnibus into 'bus, and cabriolet into cab', or the poli- tical and legal terms, nemine contradicente into vein, con., and capias ad satisfaciendum into ca. sa.. \u2014 such a lingual principle would naturally have contracted the original Bollendes-ecke into Bollends-ecke, and ultimately into Bolands-eck ; whereupon any ingenious gentleman who delighted to trouble his head with the derivation of the names of places might easily have cheated him- self into the belief that this same Ecke, or bend, of the stream originally belonged to one Roland. And thus stories would get to be framed as to the history and fate of the fancied first lord of the soil thereunto appertaining. Accordingly, the said Roland has been fabled to have been one of the sons of Charlemagne \u2014 though the ancient Emperor is known to have had no child of that name \u2014 and to have become enamoured of the daughter of the loid of the opposite Castle of the Drachenfels. The young lady, however, hears of the death of her lover in the Holy Wars (though with the usual anachronism of such fables, the Crusades did not occur till many years after Charlemagne's time) ; and is then made to enter the convent, situate on the island of Nonnen- werth, where poor Roland was delighted, we are told, to watch the movements of his cloistered bride from the window of his castle on the rock above; till at length, having heard of his beloved nun's death and beheld her burial, he was found dead imme- diately after, seated at that same castle window, on that same rock. Another of such legends is to be found in the elegant story of the Lurlei or Loreley rock, but this is known to have been the invention of one of the German writers of the present century ; and it has evidently been constructed upon the fancied meaning of the name of the place, the rock being supposed to have de- rived its title from the word Lauer, which signifies merely a lurking-place \u2014 the verb lauern meaning to watch, to listen, to lie in wait, to lurk. Hence that part of the river in the fable has been represented as the lurking-place of the water-syren Lore : an enchantress who, by the attractions of her voice, is said to entice the boatmen into the gulf of the whirlpool beneath which she lived. The latter part of the story, however, is merely a poetical myth to account for the reverberations of the celebrated echo which may be heard at this part of the Rhine ; for the syren in the legend is made to answer the songs of the boatmen 25"], [402, "386 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. in so bewitching a manner in the night-time, that the course of the craft is forgotten by the oarsmen, while listening to the spell of the enchantress above, and all within the vessel are conse quently hurled to destruction in the rapids among the rocks. In some of the legends hereafter given we are strongly led to suspect a similar etymological origin. That, for instance, con nected with the \" Limpert's-stone, in Gerstungen, we imagine to have been fabricated by some ingenious story-teller, merely to account for the existence of a curious monument still to be seen in that village, and to which the name of \"Limpert\" \u2014 Heaven knows why or wherefore \u2014 has come to be attached ; for it seems to us, that the unhappy hero of the tale has been made a cripple merely because the name appeared to suggest some connection with limping or lameness. Even so, the last of the stories here appended, and which we have entitled \"Cock-crow Farm\" \u2014 merely for the want of a better way of rendering the German title, \"Hahnhof \" \u2014 cannot fail to give those who have paid the least attention to the origin of such traditions the impression of having been framed merely to account for the singular title of a particular homestead. With these few hints as to the origin of such ingenious con ceits, we now leave the reader to the solution of the several interesting riddles himself ; and proceed to quote in full some one or two of each class of the best Thuringian legends that we have been able to find in the Chronicles of the country."], [403, "CHAPTER XXX. THE STORY OF THE WONDERFUL LOVES OF TANNHAUSER AND VENUS, AND OF THE SINGERS' CONTEST AT THE WARTBURG. This legend, as narrated at the present day, is a curious in- stance as to how the early Catholic priests always managed to give a papal turn to the folk-lore of the country to which they came ; for in no national tradition is this priestly tampering more evident than in the following mythic tale. When the day greys, the story runs, and the cock crows, the wild huntsman's spectral train hurries back into the Horselberg ; where the old guardian of the day and night, Eckart by name, sits in a gloomy cleft of the rock, warning those who seek to enter the enchanted cavern of the mountain, within which the Frau Venus holds her court, and bidding them pause ere they peril their eternal happiness for a few brief hours of worldly pleasure. Now it so happened that a young noble from Frankenland, who was a Minnesanger as well as a gallant knight, and had met with many an adventure in his chivalrous and minstrel wander- ings, which had stretched far and wide, passed by the Horsel- berg on his way to the Wartburg ; for he was anxious to reach the castle before night-fall, as the Landgraf Herrmann had in- vited him thither to take part in the Singers' Contest. Near one of the peaks of the rock he beheld a female form of most supernatural beauty, and robed in the gauziest garments, with the choicest taste. Out of the depths of the mountain-chain came gusts of music, now soft and now wild as the swelling and dying strains of the wild-harp. The sweet witchery of the sounds infa- tuated him like a spell ; so, paying no heed to the faithful Eckart's warning, he scaled the cliff, and brushing by the grey- beard, entered the mouth of the cavern. Then he groped his way to the inmost recesses of the mountain, and there in a crystal"], [404, "388 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. chamber glittering with stalactites, he found the beautiful \"Frau Venus \" \u2014 for it was she who had enchanted him : and so fasci nated did be become with her charms that he remained with her, rapt in the passionate delirium of her embraces, until a whole year had passed. At length, satiated with voluptuousness, he grew indifferent to the graces of the sorceress, and an unconquerable longing to leave the sinful place fastened upon him. Frau Venus, how ever, strove strongly to win back his love for her ; nor would she let him go until he had sworn, by his honour as a knight, that, in case the Church should refuse him forgiveness for his dal liance there, he would return and abide with her for ever after. The troth being plighted, Frau Venus, sore at heart, allowed the knight to go his way ; and no sooner had he quitted the en chanted cave of the Horselberg than he bent his steps towards Rome. There, he sank down on his knees before Pope Urban, and kissing the holy Father's feet, confessed the heinous sin of which he had been guilty; but his Holiness cast the wicked minstrel-knight from him, reviling him bitterly for his misdeeds. Now Pope Urban chanced to have in his hand at the time of the knight's visit to him, a hermit's white cross, made of peeled osier twigs, and he cried, \" Lo ! as little chance as there is of these dead sticks becoming green again in three days, even so little hope hast thou of obtaining forgiveness from either God or man.\" The hard words touched the knight to the quick, and he begged to be allowed a year for penance and penitence ; but to no avail. So, despairing of the grace of God and his Saviour, he wended his way sorrowfully back to the Horselberg, where he was received with the greatest fondness by the enchantress Venus herself. It so fell out, however, that on the third day after the knight had quitted Rome, the dead osier twigs of the Pope's white wand began to bud and put forth green leaves ; and the sight of this marvel of Almighty power so moved the Holy Father that he sent out messengers to every country throughout the world, in order to recall the knight, and let him see by what wondrous tokens Heaven forgives the repentant. But though every corner was searched, the gallant minstrel was nowhere to be found ; for he was doomed to remain in the Horsel mountains till the end of the world. Then went the wondrous tale of Tannhauser (for so the"], [405, "TANNHAUSER AND VENUS. 389 minstrel knight was called) forth, from mouth to mouth, through the whole of the Thuringian land. Such stories as the above never bear the test of dates : e.g. Landgraf Herrmann ruled in Thuringia between the years J 190 and 1216, and between those periods there was no Pope of the name of Urban sitting in St. Peter's chair. Pope Urban I. for instance, occupied the Papal throne from ad. 223 to 230 ; Urban II. from 1088 to 1099 ; Urban III. from 1185 to 11\u00bb7 ; and Urban IV. from 1261 to 1265. Again : how finely inconsequential is the Papal justice of the legend ! The Holy Father will not forgive the knight because of his great siufulness, but he will because a stick, which he thought to be dead, puts forth buds within an appointed time ; but \u2014 notwithstanding we are told that by these \" wondrous tokens Heaveu forgives the repentant\" \u2014 the minstrel-knight is doomed to remain in the Horselberg to the end of the world. There is, however, far more elegance in the Roman fable, where the beautiful young hunter-dog is made to be enamoured of the charms of the vestal goddess, than in the German myth, which changes him into a minstrel, and Venus, herself into a Frau and a witch as well ! In the fresco painted on the walls of the Sangers'-saal at the Wartburg, which pretends to be a repre sentation of the \"Singers' Contest\" under Landgraf Herrmann, Heinrich von Ofterdingen, the minstrel burgher of Eisenach, is made the successful competitor among the assembled Minnesdn gers; and it is he we are told who passed by the name of Tann hauser. In the opera, too, founded upon the same subject, the same mistake occurs ; for it is clear, by the legend above given, that Tannhauser himself was never thought to have taken part in the contest \u2014 he having been enchanted by Venus while pass ing the Horselberg, on his way to the meeting at the Wartburg, and forced by the sorceress to remain with her a twelvemonth after, secreted in the mountain ; where, according to the be.^t authorities, he still continues, and is to continue till the end of time. That the above legend is merely a clumsy German transforma tion of the elegant Roman myth of the loves of Adonis and Venus, no scholar can have the least doubt ; the very name of Venus is so un-Teutonic in its character, that this alone would lead us to question the Dutch origin of the story; while the title Tann hauser signifies literally a \" green-bower,\" or hut, decorated with"], [406, "390 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. branches of the \" Tannebaum \" or fir-tree. This style of decora tion is the custom with the Thuringians to the present day ; for, on the occasion of any rejoicing, the walls of the houses are either hung with garlands made of the boughs of this same Tannebaum, or else the entire hall is converted into a large green arbour by covering every side of it with the evergreen ornament. Many of the Thuringian songs are in praise of the sempervirent graces of this same tree. \" Oh, loved fir-tree ! oh, loved fir-tree ! runs one of the most popular of the Thuringian ditties, \" How green are all thy branches ! Green, not alone in summer-time, But greener still 'mid winter's rime. Oh, loved fir-tree! oh, loved fir-tree ! how green appear thy branches !\" Hence it would seem, from the mere etymology of the words, that the Herr Tannhauser was simply a mythic impersonation of that principle of regeneration in the universe, which it is well known the classic boy-god Adonis was meant to symbolize ; and that the green of the fir-tree was used merely to foreshadow, in the early spring-time, the verdant state that all nature was shortly, through this same principle of regeneration, to assume. On the other hand, the Thuringian Venus, even though she is distorted into a sorceress and a vulgar German Frau in the boorish Teutonic legend, was clearly none other than the Grecian Aphrodite \u2014 or the Roman Venus \u2014 who was the elegant imper sonation of the evening star, as it appeared to rise out of the froth of the sea ; and who, consequently, was typified as the god dess of love and beauty \u2014 the Welsh meaning of the Latin name (for the word is of ancient British origin) being that which is white and fair, or affords happiness : ' Welsh gwener, which is the feminine of the adjective gwen, or gwyn, white, fair, beautiful); and hence she was fabled to have enchanted, with her exquisite grace and beauty, the sun, who, time out of mind, has been re presented as the god of music. But the Thuringian folk, in order to give all the corroborative evidence of time and place to the legend, not only tell you either that this same Tannhauser intended to have taken part in the Singers' Contest at the Wartburg, in the reign of Herrmann, at the end of the twelfth or beginning of the thirteenth century ; or"], [407, "391 TANNHAUSER AND VENUS. else that he really did join in the competition of the minstrels there, under the guise of Heinrich von Ofterdingen (as shown in the large fresco which has been recently painted on the walls of the Stingers' -saal at the castle ; but they point out to the visitor, to this day, the very entrance to the cavern in which the said Frau Venus and Herr Tannhauser are confined, and are there to remain imprisoned to the end of the world. The Venus-loch, as it is called, is situate at the Eisenach end of the long mountain ridge, which stretches very nearly from the Thuringian capital to Gotha ; and as the stranger walks along the Fischbach road, past the village of that name, he can see the bluff cliff, which forms the termination of the conical mountain chain, rising almost perpendicularly out of the valley ; and high up, nearly at the top of this, he may discover a small fissure in the crags, somewhat like a rude and narrow little Gothic gateway. Within this mountain recess, it is said the Frau Venus was wont to hold her court, while the old grey-beard Eckardt (the guardian of day and night) sat at the corner, ready to warn all comers against the witchery of the sorceress. The tradition concerning the famous \" Singers' Contest,\" which was held at the Wartburg, at the beginning of the thirteenth century, is thus narrated in the Thuringian chronicles ; and it will be seen that this same mythic Tannhauser is in no way mentioned or even alluded to as having taken part in the minstrel strife. The Landgraf Herrmann, runs the story, had been educated at Paris, and in the French capital he had made the acquaintance of many troubadours, and had thus grown up to be a great lover and patron of the arts of poetry and music. Now it so happened that in the year 1207, six of the greatest masters of song in those days were assembled at the court of the Wartburg. The first of these singers was the Landgraf 's Eanzler (Chancellor) \u2014 Heinrich von Rispach \u2014 known as the \"graceful writer;\" the second, Wolfram von Eschenbach, out of Switzer land, and afterwards much-famed for his poems ; the third, Rei marvon Zweter, born on the Rhine, but who, after his return from the Holy Land, chose Bohemia for his abiding-place ; the fourth, Walther Von der Vogelweide, out of Thurgau, who had also been with the crusaders, and encouraged them with his songs in battle. These four were all of knightly standing, and each entitled to bear arms. The fifth minstrel, however, was one Bicterolf, a servant"], [408, "392 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of the Landgravine Sophia; and the sixth, Heinrich von Ofter dingen, one of the retainers of Leopold VII. of Austria, and who was a burgher of the town of Eisenach. The minstrels then assembled agreed to hold together a sort of friendly poetical contest, which to this day is known as the Sdngers'-krieg (Singers' war), in the hall, which still bears the name of the Sdngers'-saal (Minstrels' chamber) at the Wart burg. Encouraged by Heinrich von Rispach \u2014 the graceful writer \u2014 the first minstrels praised in their songs the hospitality and generosity of the Landgraf Herrmann; and, above all, they com- mended him for his enlightened love of the noble art of poesy. Heinrich von Ofterdingen, however, when it came to his turn to strike the Zither, sang only of the virtues of his master, the Duke of Austria, extolling him above all other rulers, and hymn- ing his courage, his nobility, and his kindness, as superior to that of all sovereigns upon the earth. Upon this, the other minstrels grew so irate that a quarrel ensued ; aud it was finally agreed that an umpire should be chosen, and that whoever should be surpassed by the other in singing, at the expiration of a year, should be handed over to the executioner Stempel, and have his head struck off in front of the Nicolai-gate of Eisenach ! Now there lived at the court of King Andreas IL, of Hungary, a wonderful man named Master Klingzor, of whose craft the king was so proud, that he gave him every year 3000 marks out of his rich mines, besides maintaining for him the best table, and pro- viding him with the richest clothes ; for Master Klingzor not only had knowledge of the seven noble arts, but above all, he had the greatest skill in song. Moreover, he was deeply versed in astro- logy, and could read the signs in the heavens as easily as a \"horn-book;\" while, by means of all kinds of sorcery and necro- mancy, he could make the mighty spirits of the world of shadows do his bidding as readily as hounds. This same Master Klingzor was known as the greatest master of minstrelsy throughout every laud, and the singers at the Wart burg one and all agreed that upon his decision their fate should rest. Accordingly, Heinrich von Ofterdingen hastened to the Court of Austria, and there obtained letters of recommendation from the king to the great magician of that country, by whom he was received in the friendliest possible manner ; for the songs which Henry sang to him pleased him beyond measure, so that Master Klingzor promised to return with him at the year's end"], [409, "TANNHAUSER AND VEST/S. 393 to the Wartburg, and to put an end to the unseemly strife of the minstrels. But when the twelvemonth had nearly passed, Kling zor was so taken up with his incantations and his necromantic arts, that he had given little heed to the journey to Thuringia. Hein rich von Ofterdingen was filled with fear, as he saw day after day go by, and the appointed time drew near; for he knew it was im possible to travel such a distance in so few hours as remained for him to keep his faith, and he was distracted with the thought of losing honour and fame for ever. Klingzor, however, consoled the sad minstrel, saying, \"Quiet thyself, Heinrich! I have not been unmindful of thy plighted troth, and I have still power enough over the spirits of the air to carry thee to the Wartburg before the year is up.\" Accordingly, after supper on the last night of the year, when Heinrich had suuk into a deep slumber, Klingzor laid down be side him; and wrapping himself and the minstrel in a magic coverlet that he had obtained from Arabia, ordered the attendant sprites, who stood ever ready at his command, to bear the pair of them that same night to Eisenach. When Ofterdingen woke on the morrow he was astonished to find himself located in the well known inn at the St. George's Gate, and with the host. Master Hel'.graff at his side, anxious to know what he would take for his breakfast. Then Heinrich and Klingzor bent their steps to the Wartburg, where they were alike received by the Landgraf with great ho- nour; and Klingzor, who possessed the wonderful gift of reading events in the stars, revealed to the Landgraf Herrmann the grate- ful news that in the past night King Andreas of Hungary had had a daughter born unto him, who was destined, in the course of time, to become the bride of the Landgraf 's eldest son, Ludwig; and who would grow up to be a princess of the greatest piety and kindness. Then a feast was given at the Wartburg in honour of the great magician, and the prophecies he had uttered were spread with joy through the whole of the Thuringian land. After this, the Singers' Contest, for which Klingzor had been brought from Austria to be the umpire, began anew ; and, owing to the power of the sorcerer, nearly all who strove to be the masters of Hein- rich von Ofterdingen were subdued in the strife. Wolfram von Eschenbach alone remained unvanquished. Klingzor then sum moned an evil spirit named Nasion to his aid, but Wolfram sang of the creation of the world, of the everlasting truth, and of the miraculous changing of the sacramental bread into the body of"], [410, "394 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Christ ; whereupon the evil spirit remained dumb, and did not attempt to answer a word. Now, Master Klingzor was resolved to test whether this same Wolfram von Eschenbach was a clerk or a layman. He, there- fore, sent his spirit Nasion to Wolfram's bedroom in the night. The minstrel lived on the Bread Market, near to the \" Salt-lick\" brook, at the house of a citizen named Gottschalk ; but when the evil spirit questioned the Minnesdnger as to the course of the stars, the motion of the planets, and the nature of the firmament itself, the minstrel could render no answer ; so Nasion wrote on the walls of the chamber, before quitting the room, \" Thou art a layman! Snipper-snap!\" \u2014 and there, long afterwards, as the tradi- tion runs, were the fiery characters to be seen. Thus concludes the legend ; Wolfram von Eschenbach and all the other minstrels were defeated, \u2014 Heinrich von Ofterdingen, to the great delight of the Eisenachers, being declared the victor of the celebrated \"Singers' Contest\" at the Wartburg. Klingzor, on quitting the Wartburg, had many rich presents given to him, both by the Landgraf and the citizens ; while the noble art of poesy, of which Landgraf Herrmann was so ardent a patron, gained new friends and adherents even among the members of the Landgraf's own family. His son-in-law, Graf Heinrich von Anhalt, and his grand-child, Heinrich von Meissen, were both minstrels ; and it is said to be owing to Herrmann's love of minstrelsy that the inhabitants of Thuringia possess to this day so devout a love of song \u2014 singing through the winter in their spinning-rooms, and carolling ever, hke the birds, in the fields in summer-time. This curious story of the \"Singers' Contest,\" the reader can, if he please, put as little faith in as the writer. The details con nected with the sorcerer, Master Klingzor, are so obviously a matter of fable, that one is naturally led to question the truth of the entire tale, and to doubt whether such singers' contest ever took place at all. The tradition in Eisenach seems to be that Heinrich von Ofterdingen and the minstrel Tannhauser were one and the same person ; but this is an assumption which the old chronicles by no means warraut. For it is evident from the stories above given (and they are copied almost literally from the Thuringian chronicles), that Tannhauser himself took no part in the strife, while Heinrich von Ofterdingen appears to have carried"], [411, "395 TANNHAUSER AND VENUS. off the palm in no very creditable manner \u2014 betaking himself, as he did, to Master Klingzor, immediately he was appointed umpire of the contest, so as to curry favour privately with the judge. For why on earth the minstrel Wolfram should have been de clared a loser merely because he could not tell the evil spirit Nasion what was the course of the stars, it is difficult to conceive; or how could it happen that the minstrel's ignorance of astronomy, or the fact of his being a layman \"Snipper-snap!\" could have led to the decision that Henrich von Ofterdingen was the best Minne sanger then assembled at the court? Our own impression is, that the entire story is a crude Teutonic jumble of the fable of Apollo's musical contest in the presence of King Midas."], [412, "CHAPTER XXXI. STORY OF THE CHARITY OF THE \" HOLY ELIZABETH.\" To this day the virtues and the loving-kindness of the young Landgravine of Thuringia, who lived at the beginning of the ] 3th century, and is now known by the name of the Holy Elizabeth, are affectionately spoken of by the people of the country. Indeed, the good wife of Ludwig IV. seems to have been as careful and thoughtful of the poor of Eisenach as was the late Duchess of Orleans during her stay in the town ; and one has but to speak with any of the half-starved folk in the Thuringian capital to find how the memories of those two tender hearted women are alike worshipped by the needy. The young Elizabeth was betrothed to her after-husband when she was but four years of age ; for Landgraf Hermann, her father-in-law, had fought side by side with Andreas II. , King of Hungary, in the Holy Land ; and on his return from the crusade he sent an embassy to the Hungarian court to solicit the hand of King Andreas' daughter for his second son, Prince Ludwig, who was then in his eleventh year. The Hungarian King was pleased with the honour offered him, and after making rich presents to those who were the bearers of the proposal, not ouly gave his consent to the alliance, but conferred upon his child, in the words of the old chroniclers, the \"munificent dowry\" of 100 marks of silver (about 101. English), which was sent in a silver cradle, accompanied with a silver washing-tub. The Landgraf Hermann had further requested that the young couple might be allowed to grow up together, and that the baby Hungarian Princess might be entrusted to his care and schooling at the Wartburg \u2014 a request which his Hungarian Majesty was also pleased to comply with ; and accordingly the little baby-bride"], [413, "397 THE HOLY ELIZABETH. was transferred from her home to the castle adjoining the Thu ringian capital. Now, Landgraf Herrmann had been educated in the schools of Paris, and there he had got to know many of the French trouba dours, so that he grew to be a great lover of the arts, and of minstrelsy in particular. Indeed, he afterwards instituted the celebrated \" Singers' Contest,'' at the Wartburg, at which the mythic Tannhauser is said to be carried off the palm. Reared amidst song and the softer graces of the world, the young Eliza beth's heart-strings came to be so delicately attuned, that never was the sound of sorrow heard by her but they were sure to vibrate in unison. Her earliest playmate, we are told, was Agnes, her future sister-in-law. and the after wife of Henry of Austria ; and as the two girls played their game of \" tables,\" for sweetmeats, the young Elizabeth would, whenever she was the winner, put aside her gains for some poor child who had never yet known the taste of sweets, and ask only an \" Ave Maria \" from the little grateful lips in return. Beyond such graceful and thoughtful acts, the records tell us that the child, who was destined to become the special friend and guardian saint of the poor of Thuringia, exhibited no distinct signs of that high Christian charity and self-sacrifice which marked her after-life. Nor was it till she had nearly reached her teens that the salient piety of her character came to be de veloped. \" It was then,\" the story runs, \"that her mother, who had been condemned to be beheaded by her father, Andreas II. , of Hungary, appeared to her in a dream, and said to her, ' Dear child, I am about to die and suffer for my sins ' (though what the said sins might have been the chroniclers give us no in formation), ' so pray thou ever for the rest of my soul.' Where upon,\" we are told, \" the little girl woke, and offered up long and earnest supplications to Heaven, that her mother might be saved;\" and when an hour had been passed in such entreaties, the spirit of the maternal form again stood before her, and, thanking her for her prayers, told her she was on her way to eternal life. From this time forward the holy young Elizabeth appears to have devoted her days to the performance of those acts of charity which, in the olden times, when the belief in good works constituted the entirety of religion, were considered to be the special will of Heaven, and the only way by which to ensure immortal happiness. The subsequent humility of the young Hungarian princess,"], [414, "398 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. coupled with her continual desire to visit the abodes of the poor rather than the rich, now raised up many enemies against her, among the proud and silly courtiers at the castle of the Wart- burg. The Landgraf Herrmann died when Elizabeth was in her eleventh year, aud when her future husband came to the throne he was a boy of sixteen years of age ; and then every means was used, and every petty court intrigue put in practice, by which to dissuade him from uniting himself with one who went about dressed in the meanest attire, and who preferred to visit the houses of the lowly and the suffering, rather than the halls of the great and the rich. Her dress, indeed, we are told, was of the plainest-possible kind, and she loved to sit and spin the wool and flax for her own garments, instead of wasting her means in the purchase of costly brocades and the fine linen which the courtiers delighted to wear. But Ludwig had been brought up in the same gentle and graceful school as Elizabeth herself, and no words and no artifices could turn his heart from the kindly and loving girl. Once, on a journey to Reinhardtsbrunn, the young Thuringian monarch was informed by his attendant, Schenk von Vargula, that Elizabeth was in great fear lest the venom of her many enemies at court should poison his mind against her ; where- upon the boy-prince is said to have made answer, as he pointed to the towering mountain of the Inselsberg \u2014 one of the highest in the Thuringian forest \u2014 \" Do you see yonder mighty-great hill ? Well : if that were made of virgin gold, I would not take it in lieu of my dear Elizabeth.\" Now, Schenk von Vargula, who was one of the few friends the simple-minded young princess had won for herself among the Wartburg courtiers, asked whether he might be allowed to carry the speech back to the anxious bride herself, when Ludwig not only assented, but bade him give the Princess a small hand-mirror which he drew from his bosom, and which had a picture of Christ on the Cross set in jewels at the back of it ; saying, \" Tell her, moreover, that I will be as true to her as this same glass I now send her ; and when her heart is troubled, let her first look at the token on the back, and think how He suffered for the world's reproaches, and then gaze into the front of it, and see whether she hath the image of a true and steadfast Christian before her.\" After this, the young bride elect appears to have had no longer any misgivings as to the devotion of the young Landgraf ; and before she was even a young woman (for she was but fourteen"], [415, "THE HOLY ELIZABETH. 399 years old at the time), she was married at St. George's Church in Eisenach, in the year 1821, to Ludwig. the sovereign lord of Thuringia, who had then but just reached his twenty-first year. And great were the rejoicings, we are told, which ensued in the town : the people were feasted for three days and nights \u2014 bon fires burnt on every hill \u2014 troubadours came from every land, and peasants flocked in from all the neighbouring villages ; and while the poor were fed aud clothed, the master-workmen and their apprentices drank, danced, and sang for joy at the wedding. For Ludwig himself had, boy as he was, already done much good to the town, and Elizabeth, though but a mere child, had made many friends among the poor by her kindly visits to their homes, as well as the relief she had given to their privations ; so that never was a young couple's union more truly rejoiced in, or their future happiness more devoutly desired. For a time all went happily ; but after a while the same re proaches were cast against the young princess, for her utter dis regard of the pomp and state which the courtly world expected of her. Her mother-in-law often chid her for the extravagance of her piety, and said she was more fit to live in a cloister than a palace ; and her sister-in-law Agnes would reproach poor Eliza beth with the mean offices she delighted to perform for others' sake, telling her \" that she had the spirit of a serving-maid rather than a princess;\" while the brothers of Ludwig would upbraid him with the lavish charity of his wife, adding \" that she who was so much in love with beggars would end by making the Landgraf himself a pauper, unless he kept his purse-strings tighter drawn against her ever-open hand. To which her hus band would reply, good huniouredly, \" Let my dear Elizabeth do as she will ; so long as she leaves me Eisenach, the Wartburg, and Neuenburg, I am content.\" Some few years after her marriage there was a great flood, foUowed by famine and pestilence, in the land ; and as it had been the custom of the young Landgravine to feed the starving daily with her own hands at the castle gates, she now had a hospital erected at the foot of the hill, to save the poor emaciated creatures the labour of the steep ascent ; and there it was her delight to nurse the sick, to feed the hungry, as well as to comfort the sorrowing. Indeed, the well exists to this day, wliich she caused to be sunk in the rock adjoining the \" Spital,\" and where, according to the tradition, the pious Elizabeth herself was wont to wash the clothes of the pest-stricken townsfolk."], [416, "400 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. It was only to please her husband, too, that she could be in- duced, even on the occasions of great ceremony, to put on her robes of state ; and then she would say, \" It is not for the pride of the flesh that I adorn my body with these gaudy trappings, but because it is the will of my lord, and because worldly-minded courtiers cannot comprehend the majesty of Him who had but one coat to His back.\" And even beneath her royal robes (as well as under her ordinary plain garments) she would wear a coarse hair-shirt to mortify her personal vanity. Indeed, on one occa- sion, when she had to accompany her husband and the court in state to the Marien Church in Eisenach, she no sooner set eyes on the figure of Christ with His crown of thorns above the altar, than she tore the diadem from her brow, saying, \" It ill becometh me to wear these costly jewels in the presence of Him who hath so sorry a head-wreath.\" During the famine too, in Eisenach, we are told that the Holy Elizabeth subsisted for the greater part of her time upon dry black bread, and that it was her daily custom to carry down from the Wartburg, concealed beneath her mantle (so that even the servants of the castle might have no knowledge of the act), the dainties that had been prepared for her own table, in order to distribute them among the starving people of the town. And the story runs, that once, while descending the castle hill bent on such an errand, she was met by her husband, who, ob- serving that she carried some bulky burden beneath her cloak, inquired of her, in a pretended sharp tone, what she had con- cealed there. Whereupon, growing frightened at the unwonted harshness of the Landgraf 's manner, the timid young girl stam- mered out \" Flowers . sweet gatherings from the garden of Geth- semane.\" However, her husband, who knew her ways too well to believe that she would carry flowers to those who wanted food, threw aside her mantle, when to his surprise he discovered her apron to be really filled with the sweetest roses and lilies, into which the treasured morsels had been suddenly converted by the miraculous power of the good angels \u2014 who, say the old chronicles, \" always attended upon the pious Elizabeth.\" Ursinus, a writer who lived at the time, has left the following description of the good young Landgravine. He says, \" she was a beautiful brunette, of middle, or rather short, stature, and with a fine olive complexion.\" But this hardly tallies with the portrait in a picture which is said to be many hundred years old, and is still preserved at the Wartburg; for in that she is represented"], [417, "401 THE HOLY ELIZABETH. as a tall and slim figure, with an oval face, raven black hair, and nut-brown eyes ; and as having a fine Grecian nose and exquisitely formed little red mouth. But the married life of Elizabeth was destined to be but of short duration, for after six years of brief happiness, another crusade was preached throughout Germany, and all the princes and nobles hastened to join the banners which the Church had set up. Nor did the young Landgraf Ludwig hesitate to enrol himself among the band, even though he seems to have had the gloomiest forebodings as to the result of the expedition to himself; for the records of the time tell us that he \" parted with his wife and little ones as though he was never to see them again.\" The eldest of the royal children that Elizabeth had borne him was but four years of age at the time, while the three others were mere infants \u2014 far too young to understand the tears of their mother. Little Prince Herrmann, however, as well as the baby princesses, Ludwig handed over to the guardianship of his brother, Heinrich Raspe, whom he made regent of Thuringia in his absence, enjoin ing him to watch over them as if they were his own, and to pro tect his dear young wife as he would his own sister. Then leading Elizabeth on one side, he showed her a golden ring, with the Lamb of God engraved upon the jewel with which it was set, saying, \" When you receive this token, dear wife, it will be a sign that I shall never kiss you more;\" and then folding her in his arms, he embraced her as though he felt he was doing so for the last time. Nor were the sad presentiments of the young Landgraf with out foundation ; for only a few months after the leave-taking, he died at Otranto, in the twenty-seventh year of his age, on his way to Palestine. When the news of the Landgraf 's death reached the Wartburg, the dowager Landgravine, Sophia, who was the mother-in-law of Elizabeth, feared to break the sad tidings to her son's young wife. So she told her at first that a messenger had arrived with the intelligence that Ludwig had been made prisoner; where upon the pious-minded girl (for she was but twenty years old at the time) is said to have exclaimed, \" Woe to me ! Woe to me and mine ! But I must be patient, and look to my Father in heaven to help the father of my babes.\" The resignation of Elizabeth gave her mother-in-law fresh courage ; and then, show in\" her daughter the ring with the Lamb of God engraved upon it, she asked her if she knew what that token meant. \" I do,\" 26"], [418, "402 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. cried the desolate young wife. \" Dead ! oh, dead !\" she exclaimed, bursting into a flood of tears ; and when the first paroxysms of her widow's grief had passed, she stood up, and lifting her brown eyes to the sky, said, \" Now comfort me, ye who stand by the side of the widows and the orphans !\" When Heinrich Raspe and the rest of the Landgraf's family heard that Ludwig was really dead, they began to manifest the dislike they had secretly felt for the simple, unpretentious, and pious wife of their elder brother; and it was not many days before the regent, Heinrich, Raspe, who now knew that he had no one to account for his acts, carried the spleen of his pride so far as to eject the poor young widow and little orphan princes from the gates of the Wartburg. And the story runs that, so great was the young mother's distress, that she could find no shelter at so late an hour but in a dirty little tavern in Eisenach on the place called the Bolle. Here she sat with her young babes around her till the bell began to toll for the midnight mass in the neighbouring Franciscan cloister; and then, entering the chapel, she remained there prayhig for comfort and for help in her lone liness till the morning \u2014 \"not knowing,\" say the old chroniclers, \" where else to put her head.\" On the morrow, we are told, a monk, who knew her goodness. took pity on the young widow, and, without fear of the wrath of Heinrich Raspe, procured her an humble lodging in the town, where she might live for a time in secret. Mean and comfortless as was the dwelling, Elizabeth, nevertheless, remained there with hardly a murmur ; and, on the first opportunity that offered, she bent her steps towards the Katharina Church, which then stood near the St. George's Gate, and there made a vow at the altar that she would know none other husband than her own dear Ludwig, and that she would wait patiently for their reunion in Heaven. Still Elizabeth had many a hard trial to bear ; for now that her brother-in-law, Heinrich Raspe, was the sovereign lord of Thu ringia, and she and her children but mere outcasts of the ruling family, many of the more servile and base of the towns-folk got to revile and scoff at her in her misery ; aud it is upon record that once, whfle walking outside the walls of the city, so that she might be unnoticed by the people, she met an old crone whom she had many times befriended when her husband was lord of the Wartburg, but who, in the slavishness of beggary, thought to eurry favour with those in power by heaping insults on the head"], [419, "403 THE HOLY ELIZABETH. of the poor destitute widow. So, as Elizabeth passed the ingrate beggar-woman, the old hag pushed against her, and forced her into the mire of the little stream which still encompasses the town. According to some of the chronicles, this happened at the corner of the Knife-smith's Lane ; but Paulinus tells us that it occurred near the Felsen gate, at the point where the Tanner's brook enters the city in its course through the Nicolai place ; and so indignant were the majority of the better-natured citizens at the heartless outrage committed against the good Elizabeth, that a monument was afterwards set up there in record of the wrong. At length, however, help came to the poor widow and her orphans ; for Elizabeth's uncle, who was the Bishop of Bamburg, no sooner heard of the misery in which she was living, than he gave up the palace at Bodenstein for the use of herself and the young princes ; and thither the dowager Landgravine retired with her infants to dwell in the privacy of her grief. It was while residing here that Elizabeth heard that the remains of her husband had been brought to Reinhardtsbrunn for internient ; for Ludwig had left special injunctions before his death that the flesh should be stripped from his bones, and that these were then to be sent to the pretty little Thuringian chapel for burial. And no sooner did the news reach the young widow than she hastened to the spot to pay her last tribute of respect to her dead lord and master. Now many of the Thuringian nobles who had accompanied young Ludwig in his expedition to the Holy Laud, returned with the jewelled case in which his bones had been deposited ; and when they heard how the late Landgraf 's \" dear Elizabeth \" and his young children had been treated by Heinrich Raspe, they swore they would see her righted \u2014 the vow being made over the grave of him they had come to bury. The faithful Von Vargula, however, begged to be allowed, ere they proceeded to violence, to visit the Wartburg, saying if he could not touch the courtiers' hearts with the words he had to tell them, the swords of Ludwig's followers must bring them to their senses. Aud accordingly we are told that this same Von Vargula related the story of the last moments of Ludwig, and his dying injunctions concerning his dear wife and children, in so touching a manner to the Landgra vine mother, Sophia, as well as to Heinrich Raspe himself, and contrasted these so forcibly with the sufferings and indignities that the widow and orphans had been left to undergo, that the mother and hard-hearted brother, in the words of the chroniclers,"], [420, "404 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. \"were moved to tears,\" and immediately consented that Elizabeth and her young family should return to their former home. Here, however, she remained but a short time, for, when the territory of Marburg was given to her as her widow's portion, she retired thither ; and, after founding a hospital in the neighbour hood, died in the year 1231, in the twenty -fourth year of her age \u2014 \"from weakness,\" say the old writers, \"brought on by her privations and long watchings on behalf of the sick and the poor.\" Four years after her death Elizabeth was cononized by the Pope ; and, some three centuries later, Philip the Generous, the then Landgraf of Hesse, had her body disinterred, so that it might be laid in the new shrine at Marburg. Her bones were found wrapped in red damask, but the head was missing ; and this, after long search, was discovered secreted in a cupboard of the sacristy, and decorated with a golden crown of the value nearly of 500 ducats. The head was buried with the bones in the chapel of St. Elizabeth in that town ; but the crown of gold Philip the Generous (most generously) took to himself The stone steps round the shrine are now worn hollow by the knees of the many pilgrims that have resorted to it for ages ; for throughout all Germany, Protestant as well as Catholic, there is not a name that has more graceful associations connected with it than that of the good young Landgravine of Thuringia \u2014 known as the Holy Elizabeth."], [421, "CHAPTER XXXII. THE STORY OF THE STOLEN PRINCES. The Electress Margareta. who was the wife of Frederick the \"Mild,\" the sovereign lord of Thuringia in the middle of the fifteenth century, dreamt, on the night of the 6th of July, 1455, that two young oaks, growing in the forest near the Castle of Altenburg, where the court was then residing, had been torn up by a wild boar. Now, what with the Hussite battles, the feudal burdens, and the growing desire for freedom among the towns folk, the times were fraught with danger. So the mother's heart of the Electress led her to believe that such a dream foreboded some danger to her two little children, Ernst and Albrecht, who were still mere babes. Though Frederick was surnamed the Mild, he had been at war with his brother, Duke Wilhelm, as was usual in those rude days, about some disputed lands. Among the troops who had fought on the side of the Elector Frederick was a certain Conrad, or, as he was commonly called, Kunz of Kauffangen. This man had formerly been commandment of Altenburg Castle, and had distinguished himself as a brave soldier, fighting fearlessly hand to hand with the \"fantassins\" of Duke Wilhelm. But Kunz was, on the other hand, as revengeful and rash-blooded as he was big in build and high in stature ; indeed, he was known as the Giant Knight of Kauffungen. At the storming of Gera, Kunz had been taken prisoner; but, being rich, he had ransomed himself for the sum of 4000 gulden. Moreover, he had lost in the war several villages, of which he was the feudal lord, and had been given some other lands as a set-off, on the understanding that he was to receive the rents until his own property was restored to him. In the Easter week of the year 1449, Kunz set his seal to the"], [422, "406 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. above contract; but soon after, on the cessation of the war, his former possessions were given back to him, and he was called upon to resign the lands that had been entrusted to him. But his own property once again in his holding, he swore he would not give up the other till the Elector had made good to him the 4000 gulden which he had paid as ransom for his liberty after the storming of Gera. Frederick, however, refused to recom pense him, and then, fretting under the loss of the money, Kunz broke out into threats against the Prince Elector, to which the mild monarch answered jestingly, \" Do not try to burn the fish in the ponds, Kunz.\" Angry at being obliged to restore the other lands, aud finding there was but little hope of the ransom-money being repaid him, Kunz at length planned a means of bringing the matter to a speedy issue. He bribed one of the palace kitchen-boys, named Hans Schwalbe, to consent to admit him and nine sworn friends into the castle by night. This fact is well known, owing to a letter (that was afterwards discovered), written by this same kitchen-boy to the giant knight, wherein the traitor Hans says, \"The Elector is going to Leipzig early to-morrow (Sunday), with most of the Court people ; and I plight thee my word that I will have the palace casements above the castle-rock open for thee on the night of Monday next.\" Moreover, Kunz had heard that a feast was to be given that same night by the Chancellor of the Elector, and that nearly all the retainers in the castle would be regaling themselves until a late hour in the town ; so that the time was well fitted for the ends of the plot he had planned. Accordingly, towards midnight, on Monday the 7th of July, 1455, Kunz of Kauffungen, accompanied by Wilhelm von Mosen, aud Wilhelm von Schonfels, and some half-dozen other hire lings, halted under cover of a wood \u2014 which then existed where the pleasure-gardens are now laid out \u2014 at the foot of the castle ; aud lay there in ambush until the chapel-clock tolled twelve. Then, finding all still, they crept from their hiding-place and discovered that Hans Schwalbe, the kitcheu-boy, had fastened the rope-ladder, as agreed, to the window over the steep mountain side (for the palace was built on an escarped rock), and that the end of it reached to within a few feet of the topmast crags. In an instant, Kunz of Kauffungen, followed by Wilhelm von Mosen, began to scale the high bare walls, and then, entering the castle by the window above (where now a bricked-up casement marks"], [423, "407 THE STOLEN PR1NCI-JS. the spot), hastened at once to the sleeping-chambers of the young princes. The Electress had been in alarm all the evening, on account of her dream, the night before, about the wild boar having torn up the two young oaks in the neighbouring forest ; and as soon as she heard the noise in the Castle, at that unseemly hour, she knew that her presentiments had come true. She ran in her fright to the window, and throwing open the casement, saw Kunz descending the ladder with her little son Ernst in his arms. The distracted mother implored the giant knight to give her boy back to her, and promised she would plead for all he wished at the hands of the Elector. But her bewailings and beseechings fell upon deaf ears, for Kunz kept on descending as the heart-broken Electress cried to him from above ; and hardly had he reached the rock before she beheld Wilhelm von Mosen emerging from the casement with another child in his arms. The frantic mother shrieked to Heaven for help, and ran to the door of her sleeping-chamber to have the alarm-bell sounded before the robbers had time to escape with their booty. But Kunz had, on his entrance into the castle, cunningly drawn the bolt of the door from without, as she slept ; so there was none but Heaven to hear or help her in her agony. On alighting from the ladder, Kunz discovered that Wilhelm von Mosen had mistaken the chamber of the young prince Albrecht, and had carried off in his stead the little Count von Bardi \u2014 a playfellow of the princes, who chanced to be staying at the Castle at the time. The giant knight swore an oath, and handing the prince Ernst, whom he had brought down, over to the care of Wilhelm von Schonfels \u2014 one of the robber-band that was waiting on horseback at the foot of the rock \u2014 he snatched the terrified young Count out of Von Mosen 's arms, and hastened to mount the ropes a second time ; while he bade Von Schonfels not to wait for him, but to put spurs to his horse, and carry off Prince Ernst to the wilds they had agreed upon Again the mother from above beheld the giant Kunz scale the walls ; again she begged her little ones of him ; and again her entreaties and her promises of redress were in vain. For in a few minutes she saw him come from the window once more, bearing her darling Albrecht in his arms \u2014 for the moon suddenly burst forth at the time, \u2014 and as the mother and child recognised each other by the light of the beams, they shrieked to one another till the stillness of the night was pierced with their cries, and the dogs began to bark all around."], [424, "408 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. However, before the soldier on guard at the gates could be made to hear the alarm, Kunz had snatched the bridle from his servant Schweinitz' hand ; and then leaping into his saddle, dug his spurs deep into the flanks of his steed, and was off towards the wooded mountains of Bohemia, bearing the terror-stricken Prince Albrecht in his lap. But rapid as was the flight of the robber crew, it was not more swift than was the spread of the alarm on every side, when once the news of the abduction became known. No sooner was the mother set free from her chamber than she sent off messengers mounted on the swiftest steeds to carry the sad tidings to the Prince Elector at Leipzig. Then the bells were set tolling in every town and village, and fires burnt on every hill ; and as the news spread from hamlet to hamlet and city to city, peasants and burghers were upi in arms against the robbers ; and a summons went forth from all the officials throughout the length and breadth of the Electorate, that every liege subject and true friend of the Elector was to lend a hand in seizing and securing the thieves. Great, too, were the promises of reward to the captors. Mosen and Schonfels, with the rest of the band, were already far ahead with their prize \u2014 the young Prince Ernst safe in their arms ; while Kunz and his servant Schweinitz followed as fast as their horses could carry them, with young Albrecht sleeping in the giant's lap. On and on, faster and faster, they pushed, in the hope of overtaking the others ; but, swift as was the flight of Kunz and Schweinitz, still Mosen and Schonfels fled as rapidly \u2014 for they knew that the alarm was up, and it was death to delay. If Isenburg, on the frontiers of Bohemia, could be reached be fore they were overtaken, the foxes, with the goslings they had stolen, would be safe in their holes ; for this same Isenburg belonged to Kunz of Kauffungen, and its castle had held out against many a siege. So on they galloped till their horses were all a-foam, with their flanks as white as sea-froth with the lather that covered them. Away through the wide and desolate Raben steiner forest, in the darkness of the night, and along rucked and narrow ways, where their horses stumbled and floundered in the muddy ruts; for they were forced to choose the wildest and least trodden paths, as the dogs were barking all around, and a knell ringing in every village to warn honest men that knaves were abroad. Thus the night was passed, and shortly after daybreak Kunz,"], [425, "409 THE STOLEN PRINCES. who was sorely cramped with the long journey and the weight of the armour he wore, was delighted to see that he was within a few miles of the haven to which he was bound. He had reached the wood near the village of Eterlein, in the neighbourhood of the cloister of Griinheim ; and being so close home, he grew bold as the sense of comparative safety came over him. So when the young prince begged for the love of God for a draught of water to moisten his lips \u2014 for the poor little fellow was tired and feverish from the want of rest and the constraint of limb he had suffered for so many hours \u2014 the giant knight reined in his steed ; for he, too, was glad of the opportunity of stretching his limbs, even for a few minutes ; so, dismounting, he handed the bridle and the little prince over to the charge of his servant Schweinitz, while he himself went into the wood to look for some \"earth-berries\" (wild strawberries) for the boy. Now, the noise of the pattering of the horse's hoofs in so still a place chanced to awaken a charcoal-burner, one George Schmidt hy name, who was dozing, after his night's work, in front of his kiln in the forest. He, too, had heard the alarm-bells through the night ; and, struck by the glint of the knight's armour be tween the trees, he went towards the halting-place, when he knew in an instant, by the dust and foam about the horses, that they must have been travelling all the night through. At sight of the Eohler, the young Prince Albrecht, who lay stretched upon the grass beside the grazing steeds, seeing that the vassal Schweinitz was dozing in his saddle, started up ; and running towards the man, said hurriedly, in a whisper: \u2014 \" I am one of the princes of Saxony. These wicked men have stolen me out of my bed. Save me ! and my father, the Prince Elector, will not let thee go unpaid for thy pains.\" The vassal, tired as he was, could do no more than doze in such a position ; so, startled by the sound of the footsteps as the little fellow ran towards the charcoal-burner, he woke up in time to hear the Prince's speech ; and no sooner were the words uttered than Schweinitz jumped to the ground and aimed a blow with his poleaxe at the skull of the royal lad. The charcoal-burner saw the murderous intention of the fellow, and raising his stoking pole above the head of the young Prince Albrecht, cunningly warded off the stroke that would otherwise have laid him dead on the ground. Then, grasping the boy by the hand, he dragged him back, while he held his formidable stoking-pole at arm's length, ready to parry any fresh blow from the axe of the ruffian;"], [426, "410 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. and as he did so, he set the big mastiff that was at his side upon the vassal, for at a single word from his master the faithful hound sprang, with a loud bark, at the other, and seized him by the throat before he had time to defend himself against the animal. The noise of the barking dog brought Kunz quickly to the spot. The whistle of the charcoal-burner, how-ever, as quickly summoned a gang of his swarthy and stalwart comrades. The giant knight finding himself surrounded, tried to jump on to his saddle, so that he might dash with his horse through the ranks. In his haste to mount the steed, however, his spurs became entangled iu the stirrup, and the startled animal began first to plunge and rear, and then to gallop off, while Kunz had but one foot from the ground ; so that the robber-knight was dragged along for some distance with his head on the earth. In this manner Kunz the giant knight was easily taken pri soner, and being bound hand aod foot by the gang of charcoal burners, was quickly carried off, with his vassal Schweinitz, to the neighbouring monastery of Grunheim. Here he was handed over to the safe keeping of the Prior of the cloister, and afterwards sent to Zwickau there to be dealt with as the law might doom The young Prince Albrecht was then regaled with milk, bread, and honey, at the hut of George Schmidt the charcoal-burner ; and on the 9th of July in the same year, he was brought back to the castle of Altenburg \u2014 all the townsfolk and peasantry rejoicing by the way \u2014 and there handed over by the proud Ebhler to his well-nigh heart-broken parents, the Electress Margareta, and the Prince Elector himself. The fate of the giant knight was death as a felon. From Zwickau he was borne, heavily ironed, to Freiburg, and there beheaded on the market-place on the 14th of July, 1455, at the spot where a flat round stone marks the site of the execution to this day. The Elector. Frederick the Mild, however, true to the surname descriptive of his character, was anxious to spare the life of the robber of his children. But the pardon he sent reached the spot some few hours after Kunz had paid the penalty of his crime. The giant knight's head is still to be seen, cut in stone, over the door of the Rathhaus at Freiburg. Schweinitz, the vassal of Kunz, was hanged; and Hans Schwalbe, the traitor kitchen-boy, was torn to pieces with red hot irons. But still the little Prince Ernst was nowhere to be found. He remained, indeed, in the power of Wilhelm von Mosen, and Wil-"], [427, "THE STOLEN PRINCES. 411 helm von Schonfels ; and they had hidden themselves in a rocky cave called the \"Devil's Cleft,\" not far from the castle of Harten stein, on the right bank of the river Mulde, and about half-way towards the Bohemian frontier. Now the woodmen in those parts soon heard and spread the news that Kunz, the giant knight of Kauffungen, had been seized in the forest, near Eterlein, and sent heavily ironed to Zwickau to be tried as a traitor. Upon over hearing some peasants tell the wonderful new tale to each other within a few yards of the cavern in which Mosen and Schonfels lay secreted, the robber knights grew frightened, and dispatched a messenger to Frederick von Schdnberg, the head official in Har tenstein, offering to give up the young Prince Ernst, if the com mandant of the castle would but pledge them his word that no harm should come to them. The terms were immediately granted, and Schdnberg, when the young prince was given over to him, had him carried to Chem nitz, whither the Prince Elector, on receipt of the glad tidings, had hastened to clasp once more in his arms the child he had fancied was lost to him for ever. On th; morrow a public thanksgiving was offered up in the little church at Ebersdorff, not many miles from the scene of the rescue. There, the garments of the royal youths were hung in front of the altar ; and close beside them was placed the grimy smock of the charcoal-burner, in memory of the carrying off of the young princes, as well as of the bravery of their humble deliverer ; and there the now-moth-eaten tunics may be seen to this day. A walled-up window in the Castle of Altenburg, on the side towards the \"Paritzer Pond,\" now marks the place where the robber knights entered. In the forest of Eterleiu the \" Prince's Oak,\" under which young Albrecht lay, while Kunz was searching for the earthberries for him, is still pointed out by the woodmen; and the hole in the rock, in which young Ernst was hidden, no longer goes by the name of the \" Devil's Cleft,\" but is now called the \"Prince's Cave\" instead. As for the charcoal-burner himself, he had but to speak his wishes to have them straightway granted by the Elector, Fre derick the Mild. All the simple fellow asked, however, was to be allowed to cut and burn wood near the spot where he had found the young prince Albrecht. But the Elector, in the grati tude of his heart, made over the fee-simple of a piece of land, besides, hi the village of Ebersbaeh. The charcoal-burner's great delight, ever after, was to recount"], [428, "412 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. the story how he had saved the young Prince from the clutches of the robber-knight ; and, whenever he did so, he never failed to say, while describing how he laid about the thieves with his stoking pole, \"I trillirt the knaves right well, I can tell thee,\" and from this odd forest phrase, the honest, sturdy fellow came to be known as George Schmidt \"the Triller.\" In the year 1855 the 400th anniversary of the rescue of the stolen princes by the \"Triller\" was celebrated at Altenburg, Hartenstein, Griinheim, and Zwickau, on the same day. At the last-named city a long procession walked, under triumphal arches, out towards the \" Triller Brewery,\" which had been erected on the spot where the charcoal-burner formerly tilled his fields and reared his family. The procession consisted of a troop of charcoal burners in their forest garments, and a long line of the members aud friends of the Brewers' Company, on foot and in carriages, accompanied with bands of music and flying banners. At the head of the troop of charcoal-burners were the three \"Trillers\" who were then the only remaining descendants of the family. Since that time, however, a paragraph has appeared in the news papers, announcing that the \" last of the Trillers \" is no more. In Thuringia the place is still shown where the \" Triller\" surprised the giant Kunz, and an elegant though simple monu ment has been erected on the spot, which is situate in the Fran kenwald \u2014 one of the prettiest and most romantic parts of the Thuringian forest. In the armoury at the Wartburg, moreover, visitors are shown the coats of mail worn by the giant knight and the little princes. But after the sham relics of the Luther Chamber, one naturally is led to doubt the authenticity of these old curiosities likewise ; and to enquire how it came to pass that the royal youths were put to bed in a suit of armour on the night when Kunz of Kauffungen ran off with them ; or how, if these were the garments the princes really wore, they were not hung up in the church at Ebersdorf instead of the simple tuuics that are there to be seen ? Finally, it should be added that the late Prince Consort of England was said to be descended from Albrecht, the younger of the stolen Princes of Saxony."], [429, "CHAPTER XXXIII. THE STORY OF FREDERICK WITH THE BITTEN CHEEK. Margaretha, the wife of Albrecht, surnamed the Unnatural, who was the Landgraf of the Wartburg at the end of the thirteenth century, had borne her husband two sons, named respectively, Friedrich and Deitzmann. But Albrecht's heart had wandered from Margaretha, for he had gazed upon the charms of Kunigunde von Eisenberg, and he grew to hat:, his faithful wife the more as his love for the pretty Kunigunde became the more ardent. Indeed, his hatred at last rose to such a pitch that he sought to compass the life of her whom he had sworn to foster and protect for the rest of his days. With this view, Albrecht took into his confidence a poor man, who gained his livelihood by carrying wood, water, and meat on his donkeys to the castle on top of the great hill of the Wartburg. Albrecht promised the water-carrier great rewards if he would strangle Margaretha in the dead of the night ; and he made the man swear never to break the secret of his murderous plans to mortal ears. But after the donkey-driver had taken the oath he became alarmed, and would willingly have followed the advice of some friend, but he feared to speak on the matter ; so he talked it over with himself while his barrels were filling at the running spring, saying: \u2014 \" If you kill your mistress, Fritz, you are sure to be punished by God ; and if you act against your master's bidding, not only will Albrecht the Unnatural assuredly kill you, but you will not save your mistress Margaretha by so doing, for she is sure not to escape long the Landgraf's ill-will.\" In this wavering manner the poor man went on for fourteen days ; so that when Albrecht saw how he tarried over the deed, he sent for the water-carrier and chid him as he reminded him of"], [430, "414 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. his promise. Whereupon the simple fellow said to himself again as he descended the hill with his donkeys : \u2014 \" Hang back thou canst not any longer, Fritz.\" So on the morrow, when he came again with the water and the meat to the castle, he went to the Landgraf and said \" Dear lord, I will do what you bid me, and this very night, too.\" Now, it was late on the evening before the feast of John the Baptist that the donkey-driver opened softly the door of the Landgravine's sleeping-chamber ; and then, awakening her as gently as he could, he quickly told her his name, as well as the ugly errand he had been sent to do at that dismal hour, saying : \" Noble lady, your lord the Landgraf did bid me strangle you as you slept ; but I had not the heart to do so, although I did vow to him with a heavy oath that these hands should smother you.\" When the Landgravine heard the words she was sorely fright- ened, and doubted whether the man were in his senses or not. However, in her distress, she sent for her chamberlain Schenk Vargula, to hear what her trustiest officer would advise her to do ; and as she begged him, with elapsed hands and the tears streaming down her cheeks, to help her in her hour of danger, Von Vargula strove to soothe her, and counselled her to collect her jewels and all the money she could, and fly from the castle as quickly as possible. When the poor, distracted Landgravine had done this, she hastened, with her faithful servant, Schenk von Vargula, into the \"painted house\" near the tower, where slept her two little boys \u2014 one of whom was three years old and the other but eighteen months \u2014 to take a last leave of her child- dren. Then she sat down on their bed, hugged and kissed them one after the other as if the headsman were waiting for her; and as she pressed her eldest son Frederick to her bosom once more, she put her lips to his cheek aud bit him -through the flesh, till the blood streamed down the little fellow's neck ; and she would have done the same to her little baby-boy, young Dietzmann, but Schenk von Vargula dragged her from the child, till the mad dened mother cried in her anguish, \" Oh, let me mark them both, so that my poor children shall remember this parting with their mother as long as they five ! \" Indeed, the wound on the elder prince's face left a scar that remained for the rest of his days, and for that reason he was called ever afterwards, \"Friedrich mit der gebissenen Wagen\" (Frederick with the Bitten Cheek)."], [431, "415 FREDERICK WITH THE BITTEN CHEEK. Margaretha, with Von Vargula and the donkey-driver following her, escaped from the castle window by means of ropes ; and wheu they were safe at the bottom of the steep rock on which the castle is built, they roamed through the neighbouring forests for the rest of the night with heavy hearts. On the morrow Marga retha fled to Kraienburg, and soon after that entered the cloister of the holy St. Catherine (for the world had now no charm for her), and died on the 8th August, 1268. No sooner had Margaretha breathed her last than Albrecht the Unnatural was married to Kunigunde von Eisenberg; for she had already borne him a son, who had been christened Albrecht the Younger, but who, nevertheless, was generally called Prince Apitz ; and this child she held under her mantle while the marriage ceremony was going on \u2014 for, according to an old belief, \"mantle children,\" or those who had been born before marriage and were kept beneath the cloak of their mother at the wedding, were in that manner made honourable and lawful kindred. After this Friedrich and his younger brother went to live with their uncle Dietzmann ; and finding,' when they had grown up, that their father, Albrecht the Unnatural, wished to make over Thuringia to his bastard son Apitz, and to disinherit his lawful children, they began to feel angered against him ; so that when the two boys became of age, and Friedrich had already fought against Poland and Hungary, they declared war against their parent. In a battle near Weimar, however, Friedrich with the Bitten Cheek was taken prisoner by Albrecht the Unnatural, and afterwards imprisoned in a dungeon at the Wartburg. Then Albrecht tried to starve his son, but friends brought the young prince food in secret, and through their aid he was ultimately enabled to escape after a year's confinement. In 1293 Albrecht the Unnatural sold his possessions in the Thuringian and other lands to the Emperor Adolph, of Nassau, for 12,000 marks of silver (about \u00a324,000), and when his sons, Friedrich and Dietzmann, heard of this, they vowed vengeance on their father for it. Albrecht, however, in this bargain with the Emperor, had reserved to himself the Castle of the Wartburg, and continued to reside there. But in the interim he had married a third time, and lived in the same dissension with this spouse as with the first ; so that the third wife sent to Friedrich with the Bitten Cheek (who was also her son-in-law, for Prince Friedrich had carried off her daughter from the Wartburg when she was but fourteen years old), and told him how it would be easy for"], [432, "416 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. him to surprise and take possession of his father's castle by night. Friedrich der Gebissener no sooner received the glad tidings than he set out with fifteen attendants ; but reaching the neighbour- hood of Eisenach while it was yet daylight, he lay in ambush in a neighbouring ravine (which has borne the name of the \" Land- graf en s loch \" ever since), until it became dark, and the hour was ripe for the success of his plans. When night had set in, he started for the Wartburg by an un- frequented way, and on reaching the hill-top climbed over the walls at the back of the castle. All were asleep in their beds, and the doors of their chambers left open, as had been arranged. Whereupon Friedrich took his father prisoner without, as the chronicles say, a blow being struck on either side. On the morrow, Friedrich soon negotiated with Albrecht ; and the end was, that the old man consented to give up all his rights to his son, and left the castle the next day, retiring to Erfurt, where the burghers granted him free living for himself and twelve people to the end of his days. His wife, however, preferred to remain behind at the Wartburg with her daughter and her son-in-law, Frederick with the Bitten Cheek. The Landgrafenschlucht, or Landgraf's ravine or gorge, above referred to, is one of the most beautiful spots in the neighbour- hood of Eisenach ; and though we have seen many lands in our time \u2014 for our travels have stretched as far as India \u2014 we never met with such exquisite mountain and valley walks as are to be found close in the vicinity of the Thuringian capital. These walks were originally planned and executed by the \" Oberforst Rath\" Konig, at the beginning, of the present century; and at the entrance to this same Landgraf's ravine is a large stone tablet let into the tall steep rock, which flanks the north of the gorge like a mighty cliff of old red sandstone. The ravine itself is nearly an hour's walk long, and consists of a narrow, winding pass, not much wider than a country lane, between rocks that are as high as the cliffs which gird our own shores. These rocks are beautifully wooded, with trees growing to their very summit, and sprouting from between narrow fissures in the bare stone walls, so that you wonder how they can possibly derive the least nutri- ment from the barren spots where they have vegetated. The overhanging stems slope in the most admirable variety of line, while the foliage forms a beautiful light-green canopy, through"], [433, "FREDERICK WITH THE E1TTEH CHEEK. 417 which the sun's rays, in the most glaring summer's day, come down softened into a deliciously-cool and genial light, till the path below is speckled with tiny gouttes of sunshine, like the mottling of a deer's back ; and the clear brook meanders at your side, gurgling over the stones, so that the sound of it among the rocks of the narrow defile murmurs as though it were some wind- harp in the distance. Now the pathway is so confined that you seem to be walking at the bottom of a deep narrow cavern ; then it breaks into fine open places that are as still, as exquisitely- shady, and as delightfully-cool, as the narrower passages, and here are rustic seats set round the tree-stems for the rest and refreshment of the wayfarer. In such shady spots many a plea- sant picnic is enjoyed by the Eisenachers, and many a dance extemporized in the evening at the conclusion of the summer's holiday. Here we, ourselves and our family, have passed many a bright and joyous day. Here our mid-day meal has been eaten amid all the beauty and freshness of the wildest natural scenery, and we still look back to those same lovely holidays of our life as some of the brightest spots hi memory's waste. Such is the Landgrafen-schlucht. But, on the other side of the steep roadway leading to the Hohe-Sonne, is another deep pass of even greater natural beauty than that of the Landgrave's ravine. This is now called the Anna-Thai, after one of the Grand Duchesses of late years, but was formerly styled the Ge- hauenestein Thai, or, in other words, the \"hewn-stone valley.\" To comprehend the situation of these two ravines, the reader must conceive a roadway to mount up the sides of a mountain mass that is almost as high as the Shakespere Cliff at Dover ; and that deep down at the bottom, on either side of this, there is a narrow pass, formed out of a mere cleft or fissure in the adjoin- ing rocks, that seem in some places to have parted but some two or three feet asunder ; so that, as the stranger looks up at the straight wall of cliffs on either side, he seems to be walking at the bottom of a mere crack or chink in the crust of the earth. So narrow, indeed, is the passage at the bottom of the rocks in the Anna-Thai, that the traveller is often constrained to walk sideways between the crags, in order to thread the mere crevice in the rocky defile ; while, under the feet \u2014 for the pathway here is boarded \u2014 the mountain torrent that traverses the bottom of the gorge is heard roaring away, as though it were a cauldron boiling underneath. Nor can the stranger help fancying, as he squeezes through the opening in the crags, what would be the fate 27"], [434, "418 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of him and his companions if, by some violent convulsion of nature, the rocks were to close again, as suddenly as they must at one time have parted. In this same Anna-Thai there are some five or six of these narrow rocky passes, where the pathway winds and winds, so that they seem to be almost interminable while you are in them. The feelings which such a walk begets in the mind are sub lime almost to awe ; and, compared with such natural beauty, the tawdry, tinsel decorations of the halls of the Wartburg strike the mind as the delight of savages. At the top of the mountain, flanked by the two defiles of the Anna-Thai, on the one side, and the Landgrafen-schlucht on the other, is a small cottage-tavern, known as the \" High Sun,\" with a little rude tea-garden arranged in front of it. Hither the Eiseu achers love to wander, and drink their beer and eat their sausages in the summer-time ; and, though the entertainment be rude almost to primitive nature, the walks leading to the spot are sufficiently graceful, and the way arduous and steep enough, to whet the appe tite, so as to make one thankful even for the homeliest fare."], [435, "CHAPTER XXXIV. THE STORY OF \" LUDWIG THE IRON.\" Lcdwig, who was the second Landgraf of that name ruling over Thuringia, and who reigned in the middle of the 12th century, no sooner came to the throne than he gave himself up to the pleasures of the chase, and neglected the more important state affairs of his country for the delights of such wild sports as the forests then abundantly afforded. Accordingly he proposed to his courtiers one day, shortly after he had attained his majority, and the regency of his widowed mother Hedwig had come to an end, that they should set out upon a boar-hunt in the neighbour hood of the vast woods surrounding the valley, which was then called Wintershausen, (on account of the bleakness of the north wind continually raging there) but which has since been styled Wilhelmsthal \u2014 after the Duke Johann Wilhelm, who first built a hunting palace in that quarter. Nor would the young Landgraf listen to the advice of his friends or councillors. In vain did his father-confessor speak to him of the danger of passing through the Hewn-Stone Valley (or Anna- Thai, as it has since been named) which was then the only foot path leading to the summit of the High-Cross Hill (now known as the High Sun); and assure him that the mountain Wine-Road, (which had been made by Charlemagne,) was the sole highway by which it was possible for himself and horse to travel. In vain, too, did his mother beseech him not to abandon the government of his country and the welfare of his subjects for such perilous pursuits ; for the young and careless prince turned a deaf ear to all counsel, temporal as well as spiritual, and hurried off to the chase, despite the warnings of the holy father and the entreaties of his widowed mother. So without the least compunction as to what became of his people or his land, he handed over the reins"], [436, "420 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. of government to his mercenary ministry, while he seized those of his steed, and dashed off towards the forests, thinking far more of the wild animals of the woods than he did of his subjects, and showing greater anxiety for the capture of the one than for the liberty of the others. Now these same ministers and government officers, to whose tender mercies the young Ludwig had confided the care of his country, were many of them relatives of the Landgraf himself, and therefore not likely to have any dread of incurring the anger of the German Emperor ; so that, finding they were one aud all left to carry on the government as they pleased, without any supervision on Ludwig's part, they took advantage of their sove reign's continual absence at the chase, to neglect every duty they owed to their lord and his subjects, and got to ruie over the country with intolerable despotism. For, owing to the softness and easiness of Ludwig's nature, as well as the familiarity with which he treated every one of his underlings and retainers, none cared for his censure ; so that all got to think that they could deal with the townsfolk and peasants as they chose. Accordingly the country was governed without justice ; burden after burden was imposed upon the people that pressed upon them with insuf ferable weight ; robberies were committed daily by the \" mousing lords \" in the district ; merchants plundered, and towns pillaged, by the baronial banditti, without the possibility of redress ; all manner of compulsory service, and forms of feudal bondage in stituted, so that the peasants had to work without wages for the lords of the soil ; till the prosperity of the country was under mined, and the liberty of every class trampled upon, on every side. In fine, the effrontery and unconscionableness of the Landgraf's delegates went to such lengths, that even when Lud wig commanded them to deal more justly with the folk, they laughed at his injunctions ; for, finding the nation given over to them to rule as they thought fit, they not only subjected the industrious portion of the community to indignity and oppression, but they treated the orders of the Landgraf himself, at least with marked disrespect, if not with bare-faced contempt. The young Landgraf, as we have said, loved to pass the greater part of his time in the woods, and, surrounded by flatterers, found a greater pleasure in killing an Auerhahn (Scottici, Capercailzie) at sunrise, or spearing a wolf by moonlight, or in stalking after deer all the day long, than he did in listening to the grievances of his subjects, or in attending to such matters as might benefit"], [437, "LUDWIG THE IRON. 421 their condition; until at length, from his long indifference to their welfare, the peasantry in every part came to be ground down to the earth by their feudal lords, to the very extreme of humaii endurance. An accident, however, which occurred to the light-hearted, though not bad-hearted, young Landgraf, at length woke him out of his senseless dream. One day, while on a hunting excursion from the Wartburg towards the forest near Ruhla \u2014 {where in the olden time a pecu liar tribe of people had long been located, and which is now one of the principal manufacturing towns of Thuringia) \u2014 Ludwig lost himself in the woods, and became separated from his followers ; so that, though he blew his horn for his attendants, the rocks of the Drachenstein, the Wachstein, and the Schwalbe-nest, alone responded to the sound of his bugle. On and on he wandered alone through the desolate forest ; until at length, as the shades of night began to render the way still more difficult, he espied a small red light glimmering in the distance, like a star low down on the earth ; and following this, as a mariner cast adrift without chart or compass follows the little pole-star in the heavens, he at last arrived at the hut of a knife-smith, situate in the neighbour hood of the little town of Ruhla itself. Ludwig lifted the latch of the door and begged shelter for the night ; but, no sooner had he announced himself as one of the Landgraf's hunters who had become separated from the train, and lost his way in the woods, than the knife-smith commenced railing at the whole court ; saying that the Landgraf and his retainers were but little better than the hounds with which they hunted, and that the poor people throughout the land were wor ried like the timid deer which he and his vassels delighted so much to chase and slaughter. Nor did the simple knife-smith cease denouncing the government until he had pictured the wrongs of the folk, and the tyranny of their rulers, in language as rude and blunt, and yet as fiery, as the metal he was wont to fashion into blades ; adding, that if he had as little care for the destitute as the Landgraf Ludwig himself had, he should turn the wanderer who had sought shelter of him, from his door with out food, and leave him to know the pinch of want and misery for once in his life ; so that he might be able to tell his master on the morrow what the pain of schwer Noth (bitter need) was like. However, to let the Landgraf see that even the poorest of his subjects could read him a lesson in the matter of kindness,"], [438, "422 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. and teach him how to be generous to those in misfortune, the knife-smith said, he would not ignore the duties of hospitality, but make the stranger up a litter for the night in the shed next his workshop. On the morrow the hard-working village Cyclops was at his forge by day-break \u2014 long before the young prince, indeed, had opened his eyes, worn out as the Landgraf was with the long wandering of the previous evening. But the mind of the blunt and earnest handicraftsman was too full of the subject which had roused his anger over-night to be able to get the wrongs and miseries of his country out of his brain ; so, as he hammered away at the metal on his anvil, he kept talking to himself, and wishing, in his wrath, now, that he had the head of some one of Ludwig's rascally ministers on the block before him ; and, then sighing, \" Oh, that he could harden the heart of the Landgraf against his courtiers as easily as he could a bit of steel iu the fire \u2014 and then something might be made of him.\" With the repeated ringing of the blows on the anvil it was impossible even for the weary Landgraf himself to continue sleep ing. So, as he stretched his limbs and rubbed his eyes, he over heard the angry knife-smith talking to himself over his work in the adjoining shed. \" Become hard, Ludwig ! \" cried the grimy but earnest fellow as he still thwacked at the rough bar of iron he was busy fashion ing into knife-blades ; \" hard as this bit of metal will be ere it leaves my hands. Become hard, Ludwig ! and then there is some hope for the country. Let your heart be as steel against the ill doings of your knavish courtiers, and yet as finely tempered to the sufferings of your wretched people as the blades here shall be before I've done with them.\" And, as the man smote the iron again and again, he sighed once more, \" Oh ! that I could fashion the metal of your nature, Landgraf Ludwig, into shape as easily as this bit of iron ! What a fine blade then I would make you. Become hard, I say !\" he went on hammering still \u2014 \" Hard as steel against your unworthy ministers, or there is no salvation for your land or your subjects.'' The words of the honest, plain-spoken knife-smith, say the chronicles, impressed themselves deeply upon the naturally-good disposition of the young Landgraf. He had, by a mere accident as it were, become acquainted with the disaffected state of his subjects, and he inwardly resolved, before quitting the knife smith's roof, to ascertain for himself whether the grievances of his people had any real foundation."], [439, "423 LUDWIG THE IRON. A minute investigation into the conduct of his ministers was the consequence ; and then, to his astonishment, the Landgraf found that the complaints of his rough host at Ruhla. were fully confirmed \u2014 the treachery and tyranny of those to whom he had entrusted the government being made manifest after the briefest scrutiny. Ludwig now began to feel that he had been too soft and easy with those in whose hands he had placed the guardian ship of his country ; so he determined to follow the advice of the smith, and to become hard for the future. His first step was to set about punishing the principal offenders; but as these consisted, more or less, of the heads of the nobility, they resisted his authority by exciting the people to rebellion against a monarch whose weakness all were ready to condemn ; so that open warfare was the result. Ludwig, however, was ulti mately victorious. Then came the question, What was to be done with the offenders? for the before-weak-hearted Ludwig had now behome hard enough to devise other than ordinary retribution. Penalties in the form of money \u2014 imprisonment \u2014 or even death \u2014 appeared to his altered nature but ill-adapted to compensate for the enormity of his ministers' crimes. The nobles were rich enough to liquidate the one, and proud enough to submit even to the headsman's axe, without the least struggle or compunction. His heart, indeed, had at length become steeled against them all ; so he sought to hit upon some form of torture that should be more terrible to their haughty nature than either the confiscation of their estates, or the forfeiture of their lives. Accordingly, the Iron young prince ordained that eight of the worst offenders among the nobles should be yoked, like oxen, to a plough, in a team of four at a time, and that they alternately should be forced to turn up a field of a square acre in extent ; while the Landgraf himself, armed with a cart-whip, prepared to follow in the wake of the human team, to make them do the oxen's work with something like the oxen's energy. This severe and degrading punishment was carried out, we are told, in a field in the outskirts of the city of Freiburg, near Dresden \u2014 a city which long constituted the Residenz-stadt of the old Saxon princes. The field, after having been so ploughed by the delinquent nobles, was marked with stones, and made free from all taxes for the future ; whilst, to this day, it bears the name of the Nobles' Acre. At the Wartburg, moreover, one of the frescoes recently'painted upon the walls of the restored castle,"], [440, "424 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. represents the degraded noblemen harnessed to the plough, and Ludwig the Iron superintending the work. Not that this painting has much weight as a matter of historical evidence ; nevertheless, a tradition exists among the people of Eisenach, that, up to the time of Ludwig the Iron, the despotic lords of the soil were in the habit of yoking the peasants, from whom they claimed work without wages, like beasts to the plough ; and that it was to put an end to so barbarous a practice that Ludwig forced some of the more tyrannic of his nobles to do the same brutal work, so that they might see how they liked it. Some historical writers, we should add, have questioned the authenticity of the above story ; Herr Wilhelm Storch, the his torian of Eisenach, however, affirms the punishment to be thoroughly in keeping with the barbarous state of the age ; and says \" it was, doubtlessly, owing to the revenge which this mode of punishment excited in the breasts of the nobles at the time, that many designs were formed upon the Landgraf Ludwig's life, so that he was forced to wear a suit of mail \u2014 a circumstance which caused him to bear the nick-name of ' Ludwig the Iron ' ever after.\" This \"identical\" suit of mail, it is pretended, is still preserved in the armoury at the Wartburg ; but, as that is the great \"cook-shop\" for ancient curiosities and historical relics of all kinds, \u2014 from Martin Luther's blacking-brush to the giant Kunz of Kaufungen's tooth-pick, and the Stolen Princes' go-cart \u2014 there is no more faith to be placed in such jimcracks than there is in the \"feather from the wing of the archangel Gabriel,\" or the \" splinter of Noah's Ark,\" exhibited at the several Catholic show-shrines throughout the Continent."], [441, "CHAPTER XXXV. THE STORY OF THE CRIPPLED MEAT-CARRIER OF THE BRANDENBURG. The lord of the castle of Brandenburg (a castle that now forms one of the finest ruins in Saxony, and is situate some three hours' walk from Eisenach) had, in the Middle Ages, the right of imposing taxes ou all the meat sold by the butchers of the neighbouring town of Gerstungen ; and he had, at the same time, the right to demand, for the requirements of his own kitchen, two or three of the best pieces to be found in the market on each of the days appointed for the sale of meat. The messenger, who was sent from the castle to fetch the joints from the butchers' market for the use of his lordship, was a cripple of the name of Limpert, whose wont it was to ride to aud fro on a donkey be tween the panniers which dangled on either side of the animal, and wherein the provisions were usually stowed. Now, according to the ancient baronial rights, the butchers were forbidden to sell any meat from their stalls until the servant of the lord of the Brandenburg had been there to select the primest parts for his master's table. But the crippled messenger, who had been chosen for that purpose, always came with his donkey so late to the market, that the delay was most annoying to the citizens, but more particularly so to the butchers' corpora tion. Indeed, the continual tardiness of the messenger became at length intolerable to the several inhabitants of the town. In vain they had implored the cripple, over and over again, not to keep the entire citizens waiting for hours ere they dare buy the meat which thev required for their soup at the mid-day meal. But the cripple was as impudent as he was slow by nature ; so the only answer the people could get from him, was that \" his lord and master had the right, as well as the might, to open the"], [442, "426 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. market at whatever hour he liked, and, indeed, to do just as he pleased.\" At this time it so happened that the master of the butchers' guild was a proud and firey-tempered man. Accordingly he spake with his brother master-butchers, saying, \" We will not put up with this insolence any longer ; and, if ye be of my mind, we will do a deed that shall not be forgotten for many a year.\" So, the next time that the lame messenger made his appearance at nearly noon-day in the market, he was as usual lifted by the men from the donkey's back ; and then, while he was standing by one of the stalls picking out the choicest pieces for the lord of the castle, the guild-master came behind him and dealt him the first blow on the head with his chopper. Whereupon all the Other master-butchers came with their choppers, and cut at him until the cripple's body was hacked into bits no bigger than the pieces of meat which his lordship left for the poor ; after which the fragments of human flesh were thrown into the panniers, and the donkey driven towards the castle road and there left to carry the human remains home to his master. When the proud lord of the Brandenburg heard from his cook that, instead of the expected baron of beef, the donkey had brought home to the castle merely the hacked remains of the corpse of his messenger, the Graf vowed bitter vengeance against each and all who had been concerned in the bloody deed. But the citizens of the town, whose patience had been worn out with the repeated delay as well as the insolence of the late messenger, sided with the butchers and refused to give up the perpetrators of the act : whereupon the lord of the Brandenburg declared war against the city. Now, this war was a source of great suffering to the Ger stungers ; for their powerful neighbour, the Graf, had up to that time continually defended them against the marauding incursions of the petty robber-barons with which the country then abounded; and indeed had acquired for himself the title of the \" town's pro tecting steward.\" Accordingly, the town-councillors assembled together, and agreed to send to the Graf a mediator, whose office it should be to endeavour to soothe the anger of his lordship by fair and gentle words. The peacemaker represented to the Baron the sorrow of the townsfolk for the brutal murder that had been committed, urging at the same time that the entire butchers' corporation had long been exasperated at the scornful behaviour"], [443, "THE CRIPPLED MEAT-CARRIEK. 427 of the cripple, and the obviously-wilful delay of the man in coming to open the market. He added, moreover, that, if blood was to be paid for with blood, the entire guild of butchers must be destroyed, for there was not a man among them who had not taken part in the savage act of vengeance. His lordship was implored to consider how, if the war con tinued, most of the houses in the city must be laid waste, and the unoffending widows and orphans be left to mourn in long suffering for the act of one single class of the townspeople. The citizens were ready, and willing too, the mediator continued, to pay any sum, or to undertake to do anything the Graf might please, as recompense for the wrong that had been done to him. Then the lord said to himself, \" Well, be it so. I will set them a task that no man on earth shall ever be able to accom plish.\" Accordingly, the Lord of the Brandenburg made answer to the delegate of the Gerstungen citizens, \" If the blood of the meat-hackers is of such worth in the eyes of your townsfolk, I will grant the people an amnesty on the fulfilment of the follow ing conditions ; and they are the only terms I will listen to. Procure me a bushelful of half-farthing pieces made of the finest silver \u2014 three greyhounds of a pure azure-blue colour \u2014 and three oaken sticks of my own height without a single knot on either of them. If the town can do this,\" said he, \" before the expiration of five years, the feud between us is ended, and I will give up all right to the control of the meat-market in Gerstungen for the future : for I have no longer any desire to receive my food from murderers' hands. But mark me,\" he added ; \" if, at the end of the appointed time one of the three aforesaid things be wanting, the town must undertake to deliver over to me every member of the butchers' corporation, man by man, so that I may deal with them as it may please me.\" W7ith these unsatisfactory conditions the mediator was obliged to take his departure, for to no other terms would his lordship consent. When the peacemaker returned to the town all were horrified to hear the injunctions which the Graf had imposed upon them ; \" For where,\" they one and all said, \" was it possible to find such a quantity of half-farthings coined in silver ? Where in the world were sky-blue greyhounds to be met with ? And who had ever heard of oak saplings growing to a man's height without a single knot on the stem?\" At last, however, the citizens took courage ; at least, they had"], [444, "428 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. gained time \u2014 five years' time \u2014 and they could but try in the interval to accomplish the task imposed upon them. Accordingly, a messenger was sent out to every land to collect the smallest silver coins from the merchants and the Jew money changers. Next, sixty strong young oak-shoots that had just risen above the earth were selected and carefully transplanted to a garden, the soil of which had been expressly prepared for their growth. These were surrouuded by tightly-fitting glass tubes, so that it was impossible for them to put forth any buds at the side, or grow otherwise than upwards as they increased in size. And, when the young stems grew taller and thicker, broader and longer glass tubes were ready-prepared to encompass them. At the same time, a chamber was fitted up of which the walls, the ceiling, and the floor were all alike painted of the purest azure blue colour ; the light, too, admitted to this room was allowed to enter only through sky-blue window panes, and the curtains before the casement were of sky-blue also. In this chamber a male and a female greyhound of the whitest possible hue were confined ; and, so that they should see nothing but blue, the attendant who was put to feed them was dressed in blue likewise, while their drink and the food that was given to them was stained with harm less dye stuffs of the self-same tint The first litter of young thus came to have small blue spots dappling their white coats, while the young ones cast by these again were marked with large patches of blue ; with the third fitter azure-blue was the prin cipal colour, with merely spots of white to fleck their skins, while the fourth generation, at the end of the fifth year, produced three puppies that were azure-blue all over, without a single white mark to be seen from head to foot. The oak saplings progressed in the same mauner. True, many of the shoots died under the compression of the glass tubes, while many others, notwithstanding the constraint, put forward little side-shoots, which burst the tube in pieces. Neverthe less, after continual care and watching, three saplings remained which were of the height of an ordinary man, and each, not only without a single knot, but as smooth as the glass tubes in which they had been confined ; so that these were as great a wonder to all who beheld them as the azure-blue greyhounds themselves. Further, the messengers who had been sent out among the money-changers and coin-collectors of every land, to collect the little silver half-farthings, had returned each year, and delivered"], [445, "THE CRIPPLED MEAT-CARRIER. 429 up a greater or less quantity. On the day before the last of the fifth year, they one and all came back to the town once more with their burdens ; and, on rejecting the base coin from among the number, and measuring the pure silver pieces which remained over, it was found that the bushel was exactly filled \u2014 ay, and filled, according to the terms of the injunction, with the smallest known-coins of the finest silver. Thus the three conditions imposed by the lord of the Bran denburg were fulfilled ; and, so that the justice of Heaven might be appeased, the butchers' slaughter-houses were converted into a hospital for poor cripples, the ground of which to this day forms part of the New Hospital Garden, On the spot where the murder had been perpetrated, a broad slab was let into the pavement of the town; and there to this time it remains, and is known by the name of the \" Limpert's Stone \"\u2014 the simple, unlettered monument of the cruel death of the crippled messenger of the Brandenburg. \u2014 Sagen aus dem Werrathale, von G. Heusinger, pp. 14-19. The castle of Brandenburg, which constitutes the scene of the above legend, is now one of the most picturesque ruins in all Germany. At present there remain but two tall round towers, surrounded by a broken shell of walls, and crowning tbe summit of a steep, conical hill, almost at the foot of which nestles the little village of Lauchroden. When the barons of Brandenburg died out, the property came into the possession of the Landgraves of Thuringia ; and at a later period the western part of the castle belonged to the feudal knights of the Weimar princes, while the eastern portion appertained to the old family of Von Heerda, whose descendants still reside in the neighbouring village of Lauchroden, and many of whose ancestors are buried in the chapel of the castle itself. The view from the ruins of the Brandenburg is a scene of exquisite beauty. To the north-west is seen the noble Brandenfels, with its tiny ruin on top ; while the lovely green Werra valley at the foot of the hill is dotted with many a village, among which are those of Wartha and Spichra, where the people suffered so severely from the tyranny of Henry IV. after the battle of Lupnitz. In the caverns near Spichra are still to be found the so-called Wichtel-pfenninge (elfin coins), which are merely small flat round stones, with which the elves of old are said to have played in these parts. Near the"], [446, "430 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. village of Wartha is the farm of the Baron von Rothenhahn, called Neuenhof, attached to which are the celebrated \" rock cellars,\" whither the Eisenachers love to journey in the summer, to feast upon the far-famed ale and cheese, and where the German guide - books are particular in impressing on the German tourist that \"a glass of the most heavenly beer can be obtained.\""], [447, "CHAPTER XXXVI. THE STORY OF \" COCK- CROW \" FARM AND THE BLACK MASON WHO BUILT IT The soldiers of Duke Henry of Brunswick had been compelled to retreat before the troops of the Prince-Elector and the Land graf Philip, who had united their forces against them in Eise nach. The victors had laid waste every village that fell in their way along the left bank of the Werra, so that only high heaps of ruins remained to mark the spots where, a little while before, the finest and largest homesteads were to be seen. At one of these, nothing but a little cabin was left standing, at a short distance from the still-smouldering embers of the fired farm-buildings. The times were so disturbed that none could be found bold enough to offer to re-occupy the farm ; even though it had been one of the most profitable for miles round, and it could be had at a\u00bbmerely nominal rent for many years, on the condition that the new tenant would rebuild the homestead and the outhouses. At length, however, a young farmer who had been but some few months married, and was anxious to start in life ere a young family grew up about him, undertook to reconstruct the home stead ; but, though he had agreed to give but a few dollars a-year for it, he soon began to see that, low as the rent was, he had undertaken to pay too large a sum ; for already the harvest-time was approaching, and, though he had worked early and late, there was only one barn ready for the garnering of the corn, while the ground was barely cleared and laid-out for the rest of the out buildings. The farmer and his young wife were forced to live in the little cabin before spoken of, for as yet there had been no time to think of re-erecting the dwelling-house. Most of the labourers, indeed, had been drafted off for soldiers ; and already the nights were growing so cold, that the cattle left out in the fields were suffering from want of shelter."], [448, "432 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Cheerfully did the young farmer encourage the few workmen he could get to help him; and well and arduously did they labour with their pick-axes and their trowels, so as to get the buildings up before the winter came round. Indeed, it was long after the chapel bell at Herleshausen had tolled for vespers, that the men were wont to lay down then tools for the night. One evening, after the workmen had left, the young farmer stood alone under the broad doorway of the only barn that yet had a roof to it, pondering over the difficulties which beset him. There he remained, with his arms folded, now looking gloomily at the threatening sky, then casting his eyes towards the crops that were already cut in the fields, and then glancing at the unfinished granaries beside him. Nor was his dejection lessened when he noted how the cattle and the sheep in the meadows were obliged to huddle together under the lea of the hills, to protect themselves from the wind and the rain. When he saw, moreover, that there was not so much as a shed commenced for the proper housing of them, he shook his head sorrowfully, and then strode through the twilight towards the cabin where his young wife, who had long noticed the increasing anxiety of her husband, was already waiting for him. He was in the act of passing the ruins of the old shepherd's house, when a tall figure appeared before him, habited as a mason, with the exception that his clothes were entirely black, and that the long apron he wore in front of him was of the same dark hue, while from the little cap that surmounted his high forehead floated in the wind a long red feather, as though he were the captain of the builders' guild. A twinkling pair of coal-black eyes sparkled beneath his penthouse-like brows, while his mouth was drawn up into a half-scornful smile, and the nostrils of his aquiline nose ddated with inward pride. \"Good evening, cousin,\" he said, addressing the young farmer, as he flung his bag of tools from his shoulder on to the ground till the iron chisels clattered amongst the heaps of stones; \"Why so sad ? Why vex yourself with trifles ? If you want hands to help you finish your buildings before the harvest-time, I'm a mason, and will do the work for you for the smallest thing be longing to you.\" The startled farmer drew nearer to the speaker, so that he might have a good look at him in the twilight; and then, thinking that some one in the neighbouring villages had sent him to make sport over his distress, he answered moodily, \"What do vou call"], [449, "\"COCK-CROW\" FARM. 433 a small thing, friend ? I should like to see the man who would undertake to finish the outbuildings \u2014 leave alone the farm-house itself \u2014 before the autumn is over, even for a few score ducats; I would not be long ere I closed the bargain.\" \"Done, cousin!\" cried the other, eagerly; \"I have helped others from worse trouble than this ere now. As I said before, I want only the smallest thing belonging to you for my reward ; and to-morrow your cattle shall stand in roomy and airy stalls, your sheep be well and warmly housed, and your crops \u2014 even though they were tenfold as plentiful \u2014 shall have barns to garner them in, as durable as the rocks ; aye, and you yourself a home stead whose buttery, whose cellars, and poultry-yard shall be the envy of all the peasants for miles round.\" \"And all this, you say, you will undertake to have finished by to-morrow?\" ejaculated the young farmer with a sneer. \"Yea, indeed,\" returned the other, with a self-satisfied chuckle; \"to morrow, I promise you, before the first cock crows, the work shall be done.\" \"And this you will bind yourself to do for the smallest thing belonging to me?\" added the young farmer scoffingly. \"Aye,\" repeated the other, with all the emphasis of earnestness, \"for the smallest thing belonging to you, friend.\" \"Then you must be the devil incarnate!\" exclaimed the young yeoman, as a light suddenly broke in on his mind; whereupon a shudder passed over his frame, and he stepped back, saying, \"Get thee behind me, Satan; I will have no dealings with such as thee.\" The black mason, however, was not in the least discomfited by the revilings of th$ countryman ; on the contrary, he drew nearer to the young man a whispered in his ear in the softest-possible voice, and in the I i , winning tones, \"Nay, never turn thy back upou one who is v. to serve thee for a mere bauble. I do not come to play \\he devil with thee, friend, but to save thy crops from rotting in the fields ; and to prevent thy cattle from dying in the open air during the coming winter nights.\" \" Get thee gone, arch-fiend, I say,\" was all the wavering farmer could answer to the speech. \"The rain and the frost will play the devil with thee and thine ere a month passes over thy head ; and where is thy young wife to sleep when the snow lies deep upon the ground?\" asked the gentleman-in-black in his most insinuating tone, as he still whispered over the shoulder of the other. \" Remember, all I 28"], [450, "434 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. ask is but the sandiest thing belonging to thee \" and he added, as he saw the fanner growing more and more irresolute, \" Grant ine this, and I say again that the whole of the buildings you desire shall be erected before the cock crows for tbe first time ou the morrow. \" The smallest thing belonging to me,\" echoed the farmer, as he mused over the conditions \" Wbat may that be? Thy terms are too vague, fiend, for me to have any dealings with thee \u2014 even though I am sorely pressed to have the work done, aud the price you name certainly seems to be the least return that could be made for it \" \" Tut, tut ! man ; do not vex your brains about so small a thing as the smallest belonging to you,\" returned the arch impostor, as he patted the other on the back till he thrilled him to the very marrow with every stroke. \"When the buildings and the homestead are finished to-morrow moruiug, as I promise, all I shall require is the youngest thing on the estate.\" \"Soh!\" mused the farmer, \"some calf or colt is all he ex pects. That I will willingly consent to give. So let it be agreed, then, between us.\" Whereupon the devil cried, \" Topp ! it is done,\" and stretched out his right hand in token of the bargain being complete be tween them, while a flash of fire shot from his eyes ; and then, with a sardonic chuckle, he turned upon his heel, and was lost in the darkness before the farmer had time to recover his senses. The wife, who had been long awaiting the coming of her husband, began immediately on his return to question him as to the cause of his delay, saying \" she had seen the workmen leave full half-an-hour ago, and the soup and potato-dumplings were nigh cold for supper.\" But the young farmer hardly gave heed to what she said, and passed her gloomily, as he entered, with merely a curt \" Good evening.\" If, too, while at the supper- table, he spake to his spouse, it was only in disjointed sentences, or else he gave no more than a simple yea or nay in answer to her questions. And when he had eaten but, one of the \" Antie- leute \" (a favourite dish with peasant folk, consisting of potatoes and flour fried into small cakes) which his wife had especially prepared for him, the restless farmer pushed the dish from him, and began to pace the room moodily, saying repeatedly to him- self, first, \"the smallest thing belonging to me,\" aud then, \" the youngest thing ou the farm,\" until it was time for retiring to rest."], [451, "\" COCK-CROW \" FARM. 435 But the farmer was too deeply troubled to sleep ; and, when he did doze, he tossed from one side of the bed to the other, dis turbed by the most frightful dreams. Now, the anxious wife saw plainly that her husband was suffering from the burden of some mysterious secret that he dared not even confide to her. So she nestled fondly up to his bosom, and, laying her cheek next his, entreated him, if he ever loved or cared for her, to tell her what was the trouble that had come upon him, and to let her share his distress, even as she had always participated in his joys. And then the loving woman coaxed and caressed, now promising to soothe and comfort her partner, and now to get him pardon of the priest for any sin he might have committed; so that at length the poor, distracted farmer was unable to hold out any longer against the kisses and the entreaties of his fond young wife, and communicated to her the bond he had entered into with the arch-fiend on the previous evening. But no sooner had the secret been confided to the simple, God-fearing woman, than she was seized with such a fright that her husband should have perilled his soul by listening to the temptations of Satan, that she began to feel that she herself was about to become a mother before her time ; and that her own child would be the youngest thing ou the farm for the Prince of Darkness to claim as his own on the morrow. \" Impossible ! \" cried the horrified husband, when the wife had told him of what was about to happen. \" Unsay thy words, wife ! \" he cried, as he stared at her in the wildest despair ; and then, starting from his couch, cried aloud, \"Oh, God! save my child ; for this, I now see, was the smallest thing belonging to me that the foul fiend wished me to make over to him. Oh ! woe to me, and woe to you, poor, unhappy woman ! \" and, so lamenting, he rushed to the window, and, looking out into the darkness, listened in the stillness of the night. It was now not far from the hour of midnight ; and in the large court-yard, facing the little cabin in which they lived, heavy strokes of hammers and chipping of stone and wheeling of barrows could be heard, as if a thousand workmen were busy ou the spot ; and wall upon wall could be seen standing out amidst the darkness, as the buildings rose up and came to be dimly lighted by the rays of the waning moon. Already two sides of the large quadrangle were nearly finished, aud it was plain, from the rapidity with which the work progress. d, that the whole would be well completed before cock-crow on the morrow."], [452, "436 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. \" The poor babe is lost to all eternity,\" sighed the farmer, despondingly \"Not so,\" cried the wife, as she shuddered at the words, \" the sense of such a doom has given me new heart, husband;\" and then, springing up from her bed, she added, \" pray for your soul, and that of our child ; and if the God in whom I put my trust so wills it, everything still shall come right ; and the arch-impostor himself, who would have tricked us of our little babe s soul, be himself tricked as he never has been before. The clever housewife, then, without saying more to her husband, stepped out into the hen-yard, and there, after clapping her hands three times, imitated the crowing of a cock ; and so well was the cry mimicked that immediately afterwards tbe nearest cock clap ped his wings thrice and answered the call. Then a second followed, and then the fowls in the fields without took up the cry, until the cocks in all the surrounding villages were crowing away one after the other. Just at this time the black mason was flying from the Viel stein across the Werra, with a large lump of rock resting on his shoulders between his wings. \" He listens ! Did his ears deceive him? No! there is the sound again, shriller and louder than before. It is the crowing of some early rooster.\" Yes ! and hark ! now the night wind has carried the cry of chanticleer to the neighbouring hamlet of Herleshausen, where, in a few minutes, it is iterated and reiterated by all the cocks in the village. Then a wild scream of fiendish rage was heard in the ah, and the huge mass of rock was suddenly let fall with a tremendous crash into the bed of the Werra, where it so blocked up the channel that the foaming water was driven over the banks, and flooded the land far and wide ; while Satan himself, stung with shame at having been conquered by a woman, flew off and hid himself so deep in the dark caves of the Vielstein, that, say the old chronicles, \"he has never been again seen in the neigh bourhood.\" Then, as the day began to dawn, the walls of the granaries, and the farm-buildings, aud the new homestead, that the mason-imps had run up in the night, fell together with a terrible noise \u2014 at the very moment of the birth of the httle babe whose soul had been bartered for the building of them. Industry, perseverance, and trust in God, afterwards brought that, which the dispirited young farmer had before considered to be an impossibility, within the compass of human exertious ; for"], [453, "437 \" COCK-CROW \" FARM. before the next winter the more needful of the outbuildings were finished, and a neat new homestead erected by busy human hands. And then, with the consent of the landlord, who had heard with wouder, say the old monkish historians, the story as to how the Prince of Darkness had been tricked of his bargain by the cunning of the farmer's wife, the estate received the name of Cock-crow Farm \u2014 a title that it bears to this day ; for, as the author of the \" Legends of the Werra Valley \" tells us, the farm and the out-buildings are still standing."], [454, "CONCLUSION. CHAPTER XXXVII. WHY IS GERMANY SO POOR? There should be a moral to every story: a moral either sug gested, or expressed. True, it is but poor literary artistry that has to enforce its object by direct preaching. Your real dramatist speaks from a pulpit as covert as Punch's show, and leaves the puppets to set forth, as pleasantly as possible, how devilry seldom triumphs in the long run \u2014 the preacher himself remaining hidden under the baize all the time ; teaching, while the figures he in troduces on the stage are apparently jesting ; and prosing (with out the least ostensible prosiness) from his unseen rostrum below, while his vagabond hero is singing and rioting above. In descriptive writing, however, it is difficult to exhibit scenes and manners as pointedly, and yet within the same narrow com pass, as Hogarth painted them. Words want the flash and form of colours ; and a painter can tell a story, with a few dabs from his palette, which an author often requires many a penful of ink to make out. In the preceding chapters, we have endeavoured to give the English reader merely a surface-view of such little bits of hfe as meet the eye during a lengthened term of residence abroad. We have left the pictures to tell their own tale, by the marked contrast they present to the manners and customs of our own country. No \"chorus\" was needed to point out how many hundred years behind us are the people, in all the requirements of decency and civilization, among whom such a comfortless and boorish form of existence can continue to the present day ; and,"], [455, "WHY IS GERMANY SO POOR? 439 therefore, scene followed scene, without a word to check the current of the story. But, now that the ethnological \" galantee-show \" is at an end : now that our stock of pictures is exhausted, and the \" midnight oil\" which cast the shadows on the wall is well nigh burnt out, let us turn up the lights, and see whether it is not possible to illumine the darkness, as to the reason why Germany and the Germans \u2014 despite all the schooling of the people and the learn- ing of their professors \u2014 should be and remain in such a state of political and social, if not moral, degradation. It is impossible to live in a foreign land for several years, and note how essentially the inhabitants differ from your own country- men, without framing some theory as to the cause of the diversity. To see the country and the natives, as a tourist sees them \u2014 through the magnifying glasses of a lorgnette \u2014 conveys but an exaggerated image, without the least intellectual perception, to the mind. The substrata of a nation's character are not as readily discovered as is the geological constitution of the soil ; and it is more easy for a Sir Charles Lyell to tell, even with a scamper over the land, what subterranean influences have been at work to give the earth in a certain quarter its present con- figuration of valley and mountain, than it is for the political economist, or the moral philosopher, to ascertain, even after a long course of communion with the inhabitants, or years of resi- dence as a \"protected citizen\" in the capital, to what different laws, or to what peculiar form of ethnological or political consti- tution among the people, are to be ascribed the marked dif- ferences between one race and another ; either in the general wealth of the country \u2014 the energy and industry of the working population \u2014 -the enterprise of the merchants \u2014 the tidiness and decency of the women \u2014 the temperance, probity, and honour of the men \u2014 the comfort of their homes, or the nutritive quality of their food. Ever since the days of Malthus, there has been but one fashionable theory by which to account for the poverty of every nation : there are too many guests, say the political economists, to partake of the feast which Nature, or the arts of civilized life, has spread for the great mass of the people ; and, therefore, while the more favoured of the company, to whom special places have been assigned at the board, are permitted to have their fill of the good things, the less lucky portion must, some of them, consent to be satisfied with the crumbs that fall from the table,"], [456, "440 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. and others be content even to go without. But assuredly the over-population fable has no moral applicable to Germany at the present day ; for it is not that the people there are too plentiful for the feast (since there are, by no means, so many inhabitants to the acre in Deutschland as with us) ; but rather that the feast, as compared with that of other lands, is too scanty and poor to feed and nourish the assembled guests. The history of every German city teaches us that the population of it stagnates, at least, if it does not absolutely retrograde, in number ; while many an ancient commercial emporium in Germany, which was the pride and wonder of the Middle Ages, for its bustle and its wealth (like Koln, Magdeburg. Lubeck, and the majority of the Hanse towns of old), has long since lapsed into a state of com parative desolation and inactivity. Moreover, such a vast colony of \" outwanderers \" is continually pouring across the Atlantic, year after year, that already a great Foster-Fatherland has been founded in the new world by the Germans, who have fled their own wretched native homes for the more hospitable shores of America. Nor can it be said, on the other hand, by way of com pensation, that any new centres of industry and commerce have sprung up iu Germany within the last century : such as Man chester, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Liverpool, and a host of other large towns with us, where the population has risen, within a few years, from that of hamlets into a concourse of souls almost as great as that of Berlin, or as that indeed of many a German grand duchy. Further, why is it that Switzerland, with its long chains of barren mountains, is \" the labourer's Para dise,\" as it is termed, and Germany, with its miles upon miles of fertile plains, the working man's Pandemonium, where there is for ever \" gnashing of teeth \" among the poor, and only a crust of black bread, occasionally, to grind in them? The population theory, we repeat, will in no way help us to understand the reason of the difference : no more than it will enable us to com prehend why the ordinary fare at the national feast of England should be white bread (which the Germans regard as cake, from its superiority to their own old-oaken staff of life), and roast beef (aye, and such beef as grand-dukes themselves never tasted), with plum-pudding occasionally to follow ; whereas the charac teristic cheer of Deutschland consists of black bread, and potatoe soup, with, by way of a great treat, a dish of rotten cabbage, seasoned with fat, as an addendum. The common drink, too, at morning and evening, amorg the German gentry and work-"], [457, "WHY IS GERMANY SO POOR? 441 people, is a cup of the infusion of burnt carrots at threepence per pound (as a make-shift for coffee), without either milk or sugar. Again, we ask, why should the great mass of the people of the one country be in a state of such comparative squalor, and those of the other live in such relative luxury ; so that a working engineer earning his three pounds a-week in England, is not only as well paid as the Chief Judge of the assizes in Eisenach, but infinitely better housed and better fed than the first legal digni tary in the Thuringian capital ? Aud again we answer it is not because there are too many people in Deutschland among whom to share the national wealth ; but it t's, on the contrary, because there is too little wealth in the country to be divided among even the few wretched inhabitants who are still content to vegetate in it. Then comes the question, why should Germany be so poor ; and what is the cause of national riches in general? \u2014 a question which seems to require au entire treatise rather than a few pages by way of \"conclusion,\" to answer it. And vet tho circum stances which lead to the enrichment of private individuals are, in the aggregate, but the self-same as those which conduce to the wealth of nations. Hence, the larger inquiry narrows itself into the smaller one\u2014 how did James Watt, the poor rnathematical instrument maker, rise to be the principal manufacturer in Bir mingham, if not in the entire world? How was it that the penny barber, Richard Arkwright, got to be the richest commoner in England ? How came George Stephenson, the miner's boy, originally earning but his fourpence a-week in the coal-mines of the North, to be the first engineer in our country, and to live to amass a considerable fortune ? (And, by way of parenthesis, let us remark what a large share of the general riches of England is due to the individual genius and enterprise of each of the three illustrious examples here cited.) Or \u2014 to take a purely commer cial instance \u2014 how did it happen that Morrison, the small linen draper, to whose little shop in Oxford Street we remember going in our boyhood with our mother, over aud over again, to buy ribbons and tapes, got to be a millionaire iu his latter days ? There is a cant abroad that saving is the main means to future wealth. If such, however, were the fact, Germany, for that very reason, should be the richest country on the face of the globe ; for almost all the people there, as a rule, put by a certain portion"], [458, "442 GERMAN LIFE AM> MANNERS. of even the little they earn. So general indeed is this custom, that tbe English chaplain at Coblenz told us that he was once solicited to give a few pence, by way of alms, to a beggar in the outskirts of the Rhenish capital ; and on his excusing himself on the score that be had no \"small money\" with him, the frugal mendicant exclaimed, \" That won't matter (dass schad't nicht), I can let the gentleman have change for a thaler, if he wants it.\" One family of six, whom we knew, and who possessed a couple of carts and teams, so that they earned near upon a dozen thalers a-week among them, nevertheless, made a rule of living upon Is. Gd. a day for the entire lot of them, and laying by all the rest ; and whenever either of the girls went out to work at the houses of gentlefolks, she would cany the scraps of bread, meat, or cheese-parings back home with her, as if the whole tribe were starving. Indeed, so general is this habit of saving, that even the poorest people have, mostly, some few score thalers treasured in their houses. It is, however, this universal propensity among the Germans for saving, as well as stinting themselves of the commonest necessaries of life (aftei the men have wasted, as before shown, the greater portion of their means in brutal extravagance), which presents us with the real solution of the problem we have in hand. The simple fact is, that Germany is a nation of misers, who believe in the hoarding of money, rather than the profitable investment of it, in any industrial or commercial enterprise; and hence the utter degradation \u2014 socially, morally, and politi- cally speaking \u2014 of the people. A country of Daniel Dancers or John Elwes could never, by any possibility, rise to national greatness ; for where universal meanness and parsimony prevail, it is beyond the natural order of things that there should be large commercial undertakings, or anything approximating to national dignity. As well might a community of squirrels hope to take rank among the higher Powers of Europe. Such, indeed, is the greed for money in Germany, that the people are ready to stoop to any meanness to get it; and having got it, to practise any meanness rather than part with it Hence the scantv and filthy fare, the miserable housing, the bad wages, the trumpery finery worn on high-days aud holidays, the servile toadyism of the rich, the insolent and grinding treatment of the poor, and in fine, the thousand and one dirtinesses and pettinesses which Germans are ever ready either to adopt or submit to. \" Geiz ist die Wur zel alles Ubel \" (avarice is the root of all evil) is a proverb of the"], [459, "WHY IS GERMANY SO TOOK ? 443 country; and though every German knows, by his own expe rience, the truth cf the saying, and feels the baseness of the stinginess when exercised against himself, every German, never theless, is just as base and stingy in his dealings with others. Those, therefore, who have money to part with, will stand hag gling and chaffering at the market and in the shops by the hour, in order to dispense as few pfennings as possible ; and those, on the other hand, who have money to get, will submit to any amount of grinding-down rather than let a pfenning go from them ; so that though consumers give never so little, producers will produce for as little, and merchants sell for as little, as the others choose to give ; and though employers pay the smallest wages, workmen are still to be found ready to accept even the smallest sum, and to live on the very scantiest fare in exchange for their labour. \" Why don't you fatten your cattle and your poultry for the table?'' exclaims the Englishman, when he sees, for the first time, the wretched meagre bits of beef or mutton in the lutchers' shops, and the half-starved fowls that are brought to n ar.\u0153t. \" Oh, it will not pay,\" is the answer ; \" people will not give the money for it here.\" \" WThy do you kill your calves when they are a day or two old ?\"is the next question. \" We cannot afford to let them have the milk. No one would buy the veal at the price it then would cost,\" runs the reply. \" Is there no such thing as a joint of lamb to be had in the country?\" then you ask. \" Lamb, indeed ! \" is the exclamation, \" do you think our people would ever pay to have such food killed for them?\" \" Have you no better fruit than these apples, pears, and cherries, which grow by the roadside, and strawberries which are gathered wild in the woods, and about the size of pimples ?\" you go on. \" It does not answer here to grow any better,\" you are told. \"Nor any turnips other than these swedes, which we give to sheep in England ; nor peas a whit softer or sweeter than such as we dry for our pigeons ? \" \"No, no,\" the answer runs, as per last, \"our people would never give the money, even if we produced anything better for them.\" In the same manner every article of manufacture is 0f the"], [460, "444 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. rudest possible description : knives that are no better than bits of old iron hoops, with two strips of black wood nailed on to the end of them ; scissors that cut about as well as nippers ; crockery, the forms and colours of which seem to date as far back as the Etruscans ; decanters and water-bottles as thin and fragile as soap-bubbles ; calico that you might sift through ; table-linen like jack-towels ; flanuel about as harsh and coarse as serge ; silks as flimsy as tissue-paper ; newspapers as large, as neatly printed, and as highly informed as \" last dying-speeches and confessions \" with us; wagons as solid and as well put to- gether as glass-crates; \"gold\" watches and showy massive bracelets, and big siguet-rings made of Dutch foil; pianos as tuneful as hurdy-gurdies ; and, indeed, every article fabricated out of the trumperiest possible materials, and wrought with the trashiest kind of \"slop\" workmanship. Yet, when you ask in the shops, as before in the markets, \" Have you nothing better than this ? \" the answer you get is invariably the same, \" Oh, no ! if we were to have anything superior, our pejple would never buy it.\" In fact, it is only at the first-class hotels, which are fre- quented by strangers, that you see anything approximating to the elegant domestic appliances of England or France. But it may be said, if Germany be so poor, the people, most likely, cannot afford to purchase the more expensive kinds of commodities. The true reason, however, is not that the people cannot, but rather that they will not give the money \u2014 for any thing but beer aud amusement ; since, not alone the poor, but those who are better-to-do are wont to live in a style but little beyond that of a farm-labourer in England. Even the Geizhals, who are looked up to as the millionaires of Thuringia, have work shops like a row of mud-hovels in Ireland : aud one of these worthies dwells in a house on the \" Saturday \"s market-place,\" about as elegant as a London \" Refuge for the Destitute,\" with chintz window-curtaius to the best room in the place, after the fashion of au English dormitory, rather than a gentleman's drawing-room. Again : the Lord of Neuenhof, who is said to be a small Cr\u0153sus in his way, has a \" palace \" at the little mud village of which he is the Seigneur, not half so respectable or so tidy as a suburban villa in the neighbourhood of Clapham ; aud keeps his two score of kine stabled in au old barnlike building that is about as clean and sweet as a slaughter-house, and where the cattle at the time of our visit were everyone suffering from disease for want of fresh air. Moreover, the bauers, though they"], [461, "WHY IS GERMANY SO POOR ? 445 are mostly thriving folk enough, and are said, many of them, to have some thousand\" or two dollars stored in an old stocking, will go to no expense in the culture of their acres, so that such things as guano, phosphates, sub-soil ploughs, or threshing or reaping machines are utterly unknown in the land ; and any one who has seen high farming, as in Scotland and the best dis tricts of our own country, is bewildered with wonder at the sight of the crops in Germany. An Englishman never beheld such mangey corn-fields in his life; nor wheat with such stalks \u2014 as lanky, indeed, as a Life Guardsman's penny eane- and with ears more like wild gr'un'sell than a cultivated cereal. The stones, too, lie as thick in every field almost as shingles on the sea-shore, and there are more weeds among the barley or the oats, than are to be found in the courtyard of some ancient ruin. The grass, again, in the meadows, is as rank as that of a bog (for draining is never dreamt of) ; indeed, the fine short velvetty turf of our lawns and plains is never found in Germany, for there the green sward of even Grand-dukes' \" parks \" and gardens is about as coarse and threadbare as the herbage on an English heath or common. Admitting, then, the poverty of Germany, still that very poverty we affirm is but the natural consequence of the national niggardliness (as well as wastefulness \u2014 in the matter of amuse ments \u2014 for extremes always meet). What little capital there is in the country is hoarded rather than used ; and hence, the chandler's-shop-like commerce \u2014 the trashy manufactures \u2014 the bad wages \u2014 the \" slop \" workmanship \u2014 the wretched farming, and, indeed, the low state of the technic products in general. Think what encouragement there is likely to be for trade, where the whole race is but a nation of \" skinflints \" \u2014 what chance of great speculations being undertaken when almost every man of money in the land is a \" pinchfist \" at heart, and beset with the same dread of losing his gold, as Moliere's L'Avare \u2014 what hope of liberal wages to the poor, where there is no liberality of nature \u2014 what incentive to manufacturers to produce better goods where the consumers are as niggard as relieving officers, and the ladies as mean in their finery as sweeps on a May-day \u2014 what reward for inventors where the commercial enterprise is about on a par with that of an old rag and bone store in our country\u2014 or what prospect for more enlightened political institutions where there is no public spirit, and where universal private interest and individual selfishness, swallow up all notions of the general good."], [462, "446 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. In fine, it is indisputable (and any one who has suffered a lengthened residence in the country will confirm the assertion) that the poverty of Germany is the poverty of parsimony \u2014 the squalor of stinginess rather than need \u2014 the self inflicted misery of the miser, rather than the fenced privations of the pauper \u2014 starving for the mere greed of hoarding, and hoarding solely to prevent starving at some distant day, \u2014 ready to do anything in order to get mone}-, and ready, too, to submit to anything rather than part with it\u2014 fawning and cringing, bowing and scraping, smiling and slavering to those whom they think they can get a penny out of, and, ou the other hand, whining and raving, bully ing and browbeating, towards any one who has a penny to get out of them. Nor can it be said that the poverty of the country is due to the natural poverty of the soil, \u2014 to barren hills and sandy plains ; or that the rigours of the climate compel the people to live almost as hard as the denizens of the Arctic regions ; for the fields might be made as fertile as our own, had the Bauers and the Bitter-gut-besitzers (yeomen) but the spirit to farm them as well, and the petty princes the generosity to clear the forests for the grazing of cattle rather than to plant fresh woods year after year for the feeding of game. True, the winters are colder, but then the summers are warmer than ours ; nor can that climate be said to be very ungenial, where vineyards are almost as common as hop-gardens with us. Moreover, geologists believe that the mineral treasures of Deutschland are almost equal to those of England, and yet they are allowed to lie unburied beneath the earth for the want of the pluck to seek them, the speculative energy to dig and delve for them ; while the few mines that are worked are mostly kept going by English enterprise and English capital. Even so new inventions and new processes of manu facture can find none to foster them in the cruel Fatherland ; for it is part of the history' of our own time, that when Herr Kdnig had perfected his plan of the steam-press (an invention, by the bye, which makes not only the discovery, but the perfection, of the printing art of German origin), he was obliged to come over to England to get a purchaser for the scheme, \u2014 the pro prietors of the Times writing the German a cheque for \u00a310,000 on the morning when their paper was first printed by steam machinery. The meanness and miserliness of the German people, however, will hardly be credited by open-hearted English folk. We all"], [463, "WHY IS GERMANY SO POOR? 447 know how filthy old Daniel Dancer, when his friends sent him some soup in the winter-time, was wont to take the dish into bed with him, and put it under the blankets to thaw for his second-day's dinner, rather than light a fire to warm it up again. True, the parsimony of the Ger-nans can hardly be said to run to such lengths as the above ; nevertheless, it does not fall far short of it. Not only is it the common custom with soi-disant gentle- folks to let their servants have nothing but the coffee-grounds boiled up a second time (without either milk or sugar) for their breakfast ; but we know, for a fact, that it was the practice with one family to sell these grounds afterwards (even though they had been thus twice cooked) to a poor washerwoman to get a third decoction out of theni\u2014 and even though they were nothing but burnt carrot pow-der, at threepence the pound, to begin with. Indeed, in respectable German households everything is sold by the master and mistress \u2014 everything, which we in England either regard as a servant's perquisites, or which our servants would be too proud to seek a purchaser for: the hogwash, even though it fetches but a halfpenny the pailful \u2014 the wood-ashes, though they get but sixpence for as much as a sack of them \u2014 the night-soil in the back-yard, though it yields but a few shillings for a cart-load, but which is, nevertheless, so highly prized that there is often a battle between the landlord and his many lodgers as to who is the rightful owner of it \u2014 the sawdust arising from the cutting of the stock of wood, though a \"klafter\" produces only a hand-basketful, and this is worth but a penny \u2014 the old rags, the old bottles and broken glass, the old metal, all are hoarded by the elegant lady of the house, and duly sold when the stock is sufficient to get a few pence for it fro ni the marine-store dealer. In fact, a true German lady gives nothing away; her old clothes and boots she invariably sells either to her maid- servant, if she can screw money enough out of the poor wench for them, or else to the Trodler (dealer in slippery), who makes a point of paying periodical visits to the nobility and gentry to purchase their rags of them. We know not whether this same Tiddler was in the habit of buying the old royal robes of the Grand-duke himself; but we do know that it was the custom at the palace for the house steward to go round the table, after a dinner-party, and empty the remains of the wine left in the glasses by the guests into a bottle kept for the purpose, and that such drai'nings were used in the royal kitchen for the flavouring of the royal sauces."], [464, "448 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. Moreover, well-to-do people, when they come to your house, and chance to see any ends of string or old nails lying about, will proceed to stow them away in their pockets before your eyes, with a nod of the head, as if they thought their prudence particularly praiseworthy. You will see, too, decently-dressed females follow a wood-cart in the streets, and pick up the little bits of twigs that keep dropping from it, as it goes jolting along over the stones ; and these they will stuff into their carpet-bag-like reticule without a blush, for it is a saying with the Saxon ladies that the droppings of the wood-carts boil the coffee of a morning. The same thing goes on with the cart-loads of straw : every stalk that falls by the way is duly gathered by the dames who walk in the wake, it being a wise-saw among the people that \"this gives mixen.\" Again, immediately after the corn-market is finished, you will observe a swarm of small children, who have been sent out by their sweet mothers with a goose-wing in their hand, to sweep up the grains that have been spilt on the stones ; for this feeds the chickens, is the proverb among the towns-folk. In the morning, too, you will find other boys and girls in the streets, with a barrow, broom, and shovel, gathering up the horse-dung for the increase of the much-prized muck-heap at the back of every dwelling. Of course, after the recital of such beggarly practices as the above, it would be idle to tell the reader that every one in the land \u2014 great as well as small \u2014 who orders a penny cup of coffee at a \" Restauration,\" as it is called, makes an invariable point of pocketing, before he leaves, the remains of the sugar in the little dish brought with the cup ; or, that those who call for a penny cheese, as a relish to their penny glass of beer in tbe beerhouse, always wrap up in paper the pieces left, to carry them home with them for the family's supper. The Englishman, however, will hardly be prepared to hear, that it is the custom throughout Germany, immediately the summer is at an end, to take the shoes off the donkeys which are kept for the use of the tourists ; and that the children of many an artizan, on the other hand, directly the warm weather commences, are forced by their parents to go about barefoot, so as to save their shoes and stocktnss for the winter. Now the natural result of all this stinting, pinching, and griping \u2014 of all this hoarding and grubbing, is, that the people, like misers in general, live the life of beggars from the mere dread of beggary, and suffer continually the privations of poverty,"], [465, "WHY IS GERMANY SO POOR? 449 in order to avoid being poor \u2014 starving themselves to prevent starvation, and hungering after pence with all the greed of the penniless, even while they have a store of silver treasured at home. Hence, never was such a lanthorn-jawed, sallow-faced, hollow-eyed, herring-gutted, spindle-shanked, goitre-necked, sore mouthed, sad-looking, half-clad, tatter- demalion race of people, as the working population of Saxony, seen in any other part of the civilized world. The poor Irish are thought by English folk to represent the very extreme of human misery ; and yet the denizens of our St. Giles' have an air of comfort with them \u2014 a thriving, well-to-do, happy-go-lucky look \u2014 in comparison with the gaunt and wretched pariahs of Saxe-Weimar ; and no wonder, since an Irish beggar is infinitely better fed and better housed than a Saxon mechanic. For what with the meat soup, the potato soup, the rice soup, the sorrel soup, the lentil soup, the green-wheat soup, the dogrose-berry soup, and Heaven knows how many other watery soups besides, the Saxon work-people seem to have as little life and energy as reptiles in the winter time : since, no matter how little they get, they will manage, somehow or other, to live upon less. Hence, never tasting meat, nor even white bread \u2014 no ! nor coffee, nor tea, nor milk, nor sugar, nor butter, nor even beer, except on high-days and holi days \u2014 and having often nothing but an infusion of burnt carrots and black bread for dinner, and a bowl of potatoes, or handful of green meat, by way of salad, for their supper \u2014 it is no marvel that their labour is hardly worth even the few groschens a-day that is given for it. At the time of the construction of the railways in Denmark, the English contractor who had the laying down of the line, brought over his own wagons, horses, tools, and even \"navvies\" to the country ; and one and all were the admiration of the people in Copenhagen, who used to run in crowds after them, to look at the wonderful English carts, cattle, and workmen! A Saxon labourer is just as amazing to an Englishman\u2014 but for directly the opposite reason. Our navvies astounded the Danes by the prodigious amount of work they did ; whereas a Saxon startles us with the little he can manage, somehow or other, to get through from sunrise to sunset. The Germans, themselves, have a say ing that a drop of sweat from a Maurer (a bricklayer or mason) is more precious than a pearl ; and we certainly never saw builders keep themselves so perfectly cool in the summer in all our lives. During our stay in Eisenach, the authorities thought 29"], [466, "450 GERMAN LIFE AND MANNERS. it about time to begin laying down the foot pavement in the principal street of the Thuringian capital. Accordingly, three men and a boy were put on to the job ; and though we watched these worthies from our window, in the Carl's Platz, at work day after day for three months at least, they finished the trottoirs, in front of only twelve houses in the whole of that time ! ! And then, as if their united energies required recruiting after the superhuman labour, the work was discontinued ; so that the middle of the road still forms the principal foot-way in the prin cipal street of the principal town of Thuringia. Nor are the ground-workers a whit more industrious than the masons ; while their tools seem to be more like the gardening implements made for children, than shovels and barrows intended for men. The spade commonly used in Germany, indeed, has a handle as long nearly as a baker's peel, and a blade at the end of it about as big as a racket ; and with this \u2014 after having pecked a bit at the earth (for digging is unknown) with a pick like half a cross-bow \u2014 they proceed to ladle the loosened soil out, literally, by table- spoonfuls at a time. \"Why don't you work, you lubberly lout?\" said an indignant traveller to a stalwart Spanish mendicant who begged alms of him; \"Ah, senor ! you don't know how lazy I am,\" was the honest rejoinder. The Saxons, however, can hardly be said to be as lazy as they are listless and powerless ; though, from the utter want of energy among the people, there is a general indis position to labour throughout the whole country. From twelve till two, every Government office, even down to the post-office, as well as the bankers' and the lawyers' are all closed ; so that work comes to an utter stand-still, and business ceases for two hours in the middle of the day. Again, looking out of the window is one of the recognized recreations of the citizens ; and professional men and others, while telling you what are their daily occupa tions, will be sure to mention how, from such a time till such a time, they are engaged in lolling out of the car .ment, watching the people pass in the street. But the defective food and general stinting and starving of the people of Saxony, not only produce an utter incapacity for labour, but they serve to stunt the physical powers of the entire race itself; so that, by the continual interbreeding of the ill-fed with the ill-fed, for generation after generation, the stock has dwindled rdmost to dwarfs. A more striking proof of this cannot be cited"], [467, "WHY IS GERMANY SO POOR? 451 than the fact that there happened to be one man in the town who was considered such an enormous size, that he was known by the nickname of the Bachuner \u2014 the title of a large kind of Hungarian pig. But even he was hardly bigger than the writer of these pages, who, for an Englishman, is by no means a giant. Now this Bachuner happened to be drawn for a soldier, but when he went to the barracks to be fitted with his uniform, though the very largest regimental suit was given out to him, he made his appearance on parade with the sleeves up to his elbows, and the legs of his trousers reaching only to his knees, while his coat was unbuttoned, and Iris nether garments in the same unseemly state. The officers, themselves, could not help laughing at the comical figure he presented ; and as the Grand Duke could not afford to have a suit made expressly for him, the Bachuner had to be dis missed the service \u2014 to his great delight, of course. In the army, the men get meat-soup every day \u2014 but never a solid bit of a roast joint, nor even a steak or chop falls to their share ; and the reader can form a notion as to how substantial must be the Saxon soldier's daily fare, when we mention that, by way of a grand feast on the Grand-Duke's birthday, the whole of the one battalion are treated to a fried sausage each, and a quart of twopenny ale! \"Ah, sir,\" said one of the troops to us, \"in France, the Emperor gives each man a good piece of roast beef, and a litre of wine on such an occasion ; but here, our Duke is so poor, he searches in his porte-monnaie for a groschen, and cannot find one.\" On the same day, it is customary to march the whole of the soldiers to grand parade on the market-place, and though the open space there is no bigger than Gray's Inn Square, and the men are made to spread themselves out, after the fashion of Yates' supernumeraries at the old Adelphi Theatre, the entire army, when drawn up two deep, does not reach half across the market. Indeed, this feeble little \" force \" is called by the citizens, who delight to make sport of the display at such grand periods \u2014 the \" Handvoll Bataillon\" of his \" kbnigliche Hoheit \" (kingly highness).
