But he, whose verse records the battle's roar, And heroes' feats, and demigods of yore ; The' Olympic senate with their bearded king ; Or howls, that loud through Pluto's dungeons ring ; With simpler stores must spread his Samian board, And browse well-pleased the vegetable hoard :"], [34, "Close at his side the beechen cup be placed ; His thirst by Nature's limpid beverage chased ; And still to vice unknown, unchanged by art, His be the guiltless hand, the guileless heart ; Pure as, with lustral stream and snowy vest, The priests of Jove his lifted bolt arrest. 'Twas thus the sightless seer Tiresias fared ; And Linus thus his frugal meal prepared : Such the repasts prophetic Calchas knew ; And he, whose lyre the listening tygers drew. On food like this immortal Homer fed, Whose Muse from Troy the ten years' wanderer led ; Safely through Circe's wizard halls convey'd, Safely through seas where wily Sirens play'd, Safely through death's dark waste, and dreariest hell, Where thronging phantoms linger'd at his spell. For shielding Gods the bard, their priest, surround, Jove swells his breast, his accents Jove resound. But thou, should interest, kind or curious, bend, Anxious to ask what toils employ thy friend ; Know that the Son of heaven's eternal King *, By holy sages sung, he dares to sing ; All meanly wrapt in the rude manger laid, The infant Godhead, and his mother-maid : Harping in solemn quire, the cherubs helm'd, And new born stars, and fanes with their dumb idols whelm' d. A solemn tribute on his natal day, Or ere the point of dawn I framed the lay. And thee, my friend, awaits the English strain : Thy critic ear shall judge, nor I recite in vain. * The reader need not be informed that, in these lines, Milton alludes to his Ode on Christ's Nativity.

Stranger ! whose curious glance delights to trace What Heaven and Nature join'd to form most rare Here view mine eye's bright sun : a sight so fair That purblind worlds, like me, enamour'd gaze. But speed thy step ; for Death with rapid pace Pursues the best, nor deems the bad his care. Call'd to the skies, through yon blue fields of air, On buoyant plume the cherub-child * obeys. Then haste, and mark in one rich form combin'd (And, while surpassing lustre pains thine eye, Chide the weak efforts of my trembling lay) Each charm of person and each grace of mind.
