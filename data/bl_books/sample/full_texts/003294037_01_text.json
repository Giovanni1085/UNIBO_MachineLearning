THERE is a class of stories written nowadays for the amusement of light-minded schoolboys, in which much sympathy is shown towards the woes said to be suffered by them at the hands of domineering pedagogues. Something too much of this, in my opinion ; and I have long wondered why somebody should not write stories for. school- masters, putting the case for them in a vice versa point of view; nor would it be ill that the public gained some notion of the seamy side of their occupation. They, too, have wrongs and sufferings, especially those of them who, like myself, make their living not so much by the more or less delightful task of teaching the young idea hoAV to shoot, as by furnishing, at various scales of profit, board, lodging, and parental care to the juvenile body. Few laymen know how bitter the bread you must share with others, and how noisy the stairs you can never call your own, except in the holidays. The following reminiscences aim at throwing some light into 1 A"], [14, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 2 the secrets of a prison-house with which, man and boy, I have had over thirty years' acquaintance. It is a palace of sorts, as Avell as a prison, Avhere are to be enacted the scenes of my comedy, that might seem less fitted for the sock than for the buskin. Schoolmasters always appeared to be great men in a small way, as witness the fact that this congenial occupation has been so often taken up by sovereigns out of place, such as Louis Philippe, Dionysius, the ex-Grand Mogul Shah Jehan, and others whose names are buried in oblivion, for want of contemporary educational writers to record them. At the present day there is some reason to think an English headmaster the most manifest potentate extant in our civilised world. He is certainly treated by his subjects with an outward observance and etiquette quite royal ; and no European monarch retains such an apparently absolute power of veto, un trammelled by fear of majorities or of dynamite. Yet, when closely examined, this sway is found to be largely limited by constitutional checks and other restraining circumstances, which keep the crown of authority from fitting with too easy firmness. Your scholastic hero, considered as king, has commonly to double his regal functions with those of police inspector or detective, as well as licensed victualler, head book-keeper, and general server of tables ; in the most favourable circumstances, he must act alternately as the Jack Ketch and the Pope of his dominions. And, unless he be a truly \" canning \" man, his kingdom"], [15, "The Vice-Principal. 3 tends ahvays to become a title pour rire, like that of the stoic philosopher \u2014 \" \u2014 Vellunt tibi barbam Lascivi pueri, quos tu nisi fuste coerces, Uigeris turba circum te stante, miserque Rumperis et latras, magnorum maxime regum ! \" The indulgent reader must please make up his mind from the outset to wink at my trick of quotations ; for, indeed, it is a most cuckoo-like Avay I have, to lay the eggs of my experience in other men's words \u2014 a metaphor more to the purpose than that usual one of the jay in borrowed plumes. Also, I hope he will pardon me if ever I seem unduly long in getting to the action : let him but be patient while I tumble out my materials before his eyes, and he shall soon see them taking shape as a history of \"doleful matter merrily set down,\" that should prove, if I mistake not, to be educational philosophy teaching by examples. I. EVERYTHING must have a beginning ; and my dtbut on the scholastic stage was a singularly unpropitious one. When I left the university with a respectable but not very brilliant degree, I found myself in the common case of hardly knowing to what profit I should turn the acquirements of an expensive education. I had thought of the Church, but now saw reason at least to delay seeking orders till after fuller consideration."], [16, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 4 Teaching boys was the only other work I seemed fit for \u2014 I say seemed, because I had never given the subject a moment's thought, but took it for granted one must be able to teach what one had spent years in learning. Thus, like many other men in the same hazy circumstances, I saw nothing for it but a post as assistant- master at some school, Avhere I should be able to earn a livelihood while looking about me for a year or two, and perpending how best to take the Avorld by the horns for a serious struggle with fortune. I am writing of a generation ago, when the market was not so overstocked with somewhat aimless university men, and masterships were less run after by young graduates, our main difficulty being a certain social stigma that still marked the usher, for long largely recruited from the leavings of other occupations. Scholars and gentlemen might Avell think twice before marching through Coventry with such comrades as the intellectually ragged regiment into Avhich I had the ambition of enlisting, when even my small pretensions gave me a right to enter the service on terms of superiority, or in a compagnie d'ilite. The junior ranks of the scholastic army are not yet all they might be ; but every day now sees them more and more closed against the class of nondescript subalterns Avho used to peddle their inefficiency from school to school, till they either fell into the more profitable Avays of some other trade,' or lost themselves in heaven-knows-what"], [17, "The Vice- Principal. 5 quicksands. One has often puzzled over the latter end of school-assistants in that generation, for the most part without means or hope to start a school of their own, yet a dead donkey Avas not such a rare sight as a grey-haired usher. I might have aspired, then, higher than I did; but I Avas oppressed by the modesty of inexperi- ence, and by a becoming respect for the dignity of education. So, instead of applying for the help and advice of those who would have put me in the right way, I entered myself on the books of a scholastic agent, even as Gil Bias, seeking a post as footman, betook himself to a man of business, who, in consideration of tAvo ducats, allowed the impecunious youth to consult his register of vacancies. The agent received me with a lofty condescension which still further impressed upon me the sense of my deficiencies ; and so great was my ignorance and self-distrust, that I felt it almost presumptuous in me to have sought his aid, when I had to fill up a list of acquirements and abilities suggesting a clientele of senior wranglers and polyglot linguists. I hesitated in choosing the at once most respect- able and most good-natured of my acquaintances to bear testimony to me, but I need not have troubled on that score, as I afterwards learned that not the least application was made to these references of mine, so I might as well have set down the Prime Minister and the Archbishop of Canterbury Avhile I was about it. A more important matter of form was the signing an"], [18, "6 A Schoolmaster's Stories. obligation to pay the agent five per cent, in advance on the amount of my prospective salary. \"Very good,\" said the dealer in educational talent, glancing over my list of qualifications. \"We have the best schools in England on our books, and I think I can promise you a first-class post.\" This seemed too good to be true. The best schools in England, I understood, were such as Eton, HarroAV, Winchester. Was it possible that they stood on my agent's books? If so, I could only hope that no headmaster of such a school might Avaste his time nibbling at my poor bait, for in that case I should feel like any gudgeon fisher who might chance to find himself with a twenty pound salmon on his hook. I was not even prepared to land an engagement off-hand. I had delayed my application till the middle of a scholastic term, supposing that weeks must pass before it attracted notice, and weeks more in persuading some actual pedagogue to avail himself of my questionable services. But to my surprise, I had hardly throAvn a line into those untried scholastic waters when I got a decided bite. Two days after registering my name and address at the agent's, a letter reached me from one Dr Spick, LL.D., Principal of the \" Royal Southern Collegiate Institution \" at Brighton, as I learned from the heading on his note paper. He explained himself to be in immediate Avant of a Vice-Principal for this high-styled establishment, demanded my terms"], [19, "The Vice-Principal. 7 and testimonials, and particularly requested to see my carte de visile, as, owing to the sudden resignation of his \"late colleague,\" he found himself unable to come to town for a personal interview. I lost no time in forwarding him my papers and photograph, Avith a letter in Avhich I Avent more than half Avay to meet his probable contempt, hinting that I had not aspired to such an important vacancy. Again to my utter astonishment, by return of post, Dr Spick pro posed that I should come at once on a month's trial, after Avhich, if we proved mutually suitable, the question of terms might be settled. I was so innocent that I did not even think to inquire of what university he Avas an LL.D., but closed with his offer, still unable to trust my good luck, and in painful doubt that I might be unmasked as an impostor, unworthy to have the greatness of Vice-Principalship thrust upon my blushing in competency. I had not even prudence to consult that agent of mine, who, no doubt, would have given me sound advice here, since the vagueness of arrangement as to my salary would naturally extend itself to his prospect of commission thereon. Down I Avent to Brighton upon a raw and gusty afternoon, that seemed too much in keeping with my ill-assured fortunes. Unwilling to disturb Dr Spick at his dinner, I Avaited an hour or two at the station to refresh and compose myself for the important introduction. Then, after some difficulty, I found a flyman Avho professed to know where the Royal Southern Collegiate Institution"], [20, "8 A Schoolmaster's Stories. was. I had pictured it as a spacious, stately, possibly gloomy building in large grounds, and was rather taken aback when my Jehu's stumbling beast stopped before a detached house of no great size, at the corner of an unfinished street by the back of the town. I thought he must have made a mistake, the more so as a gas lamp lit up a board running along the side of the house, on which Avas legibly inscribed, \" The Sussex Lyceum,\" Avhile a large brass plate on the door proclaimed it to be a Collegiate Establishment for the Education of Young Gentlemen. The fly man, however, stuck to it that this Avas Dr Spick's, and a slipshod girl who opened the door confirmed him, though in a feeble manner that seemed due to a cold in her head. On paying him off, I felt as if I Avere burning my ships behind me. But I had screwed my courage to go through with this adventure, and with stifled misgivings I let that sniffing damsel introduce me into the presence of the Principal. My preconceptions of a Brighton schoolmaster having more or less unconsciously taken Dr Blimber as model, I had looked to find him elderly and dignified, if not severe and formal. Again was I to be undeceived. Dr Spick turned out a smooth-faced, unimposing man, not much above my own age, dressed in a suit of black that might have made pretensions to a character for sobriety, had the effect not been incongruously marred by a rather dirty white waistcoat and cheap satin neck-tie. Further, I noted him as a"], [21, "The Vice-Principal. 9 podgy young man, at once flabby and florid, who, when I entered, sat poring over a very large book; and I knoAV not Avhat in his air or attitude suggested that scene Avhere the Vicar of Wakefield makes acquaintance Avith Mr Ephraim Jenkinson. It Avould, somehow, have seemed natural for him to receive me with a remark that \" The cosmogony or creation of the world has puzzled philosophers of all ages,\" and go on to quote \"Anarchon ara kai atelutaion to pan,\" or some other fragment of recondite scholarship. Instead of which he opined that I must have had a cold journey, and asked if I Avould not like any tea. Declining this offer, I sat down, and the Doctor opposite, examining me with shifty looks as if anxious to knoAV how I took him, myself not less concerned to make a favourable impression. For a minute or two we fenced with mere civilities, till, taking heart to find my Principal no such austere personage as I had pictured him, I ventured a hint as to the inexperience Avhich I hoped to make up for by readiness to be instructed. \" I do not doubt you will prove competent, Avhen once you have fallen into my routine,\" said the Doctor, with gracious condescension. \" I propose to assign as your department the teaching of classics and modern languages. I myself attend principally to the English subjects, Avhich I judge to be of paramount importance at the present day. I cannot consider a youth Avell educated Avho is not acquainted with his OAvn language. That is my opinion.\""], [22, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 10 \" Very true,\" I assented cordially, while it began to daAvn upon me that Dr Spick's grammatical exercises were much in the first person. \"I am, above all, a practical schoolmaster; still,\" he went on, \" I have my ideas on classical educa tion. I have frequently meditated bringing out a book on the teaching of Latin. Has it ever occurred to you that the translation of the classics would offer much less difficulty if the words Avere printed straight on in the order of meaning, instead of being jumbled up in the extraordinary way affected by ancient writers ? Why confuse a pupil's ideas by separating an adjective from its substantive, and a verb from its object? Anna virumque cano for example : surely cano should logically stand the first word of the sentence ? Perhaps, some day, we may collaborate in bring ing out an edition of Virgil on this improved principle.\" I sat dumbfounded by such a suggestion, but the Doctor seemed to take my silence for assent to his theory, and went on in a gush of con fidence. \" I know, by my own experience, that there must be some radical defect in the present method. Now, I have great facility in Latin composition, but I confess to a difficulty in construing an author \u2014 unless I happen to be familiar with him,\" he made haste to add. \"Where on earth did you get your doctor's degree?\" I thought to myself, but did not say; then, as if he read my thoughts, Dr Spick"], [23, "The Vice-Principal. 11 remarked, in case I might misunderstand his pretensions: \"Classics are not my strong point. I look on this as an obsolete subject. My degree is a German one, I should inform you.\" \"Do they give LL.D.'s in Germany?\" I asked, and a moment afterwards wished I had held my tongue. \" Not precisely. Ph.D. is my precise title; but I have thought Avell to anglicise it by the corre sponding equivalent,\" quoth the Doctor, Avith the air of one who would pass lightly over a delicate point. \" I am beginning to Avork at German, and should be glad of your assistance,\" said I, in the char itable intention of putting him at ease under this aAvkward admission. \"Certainly \u2014 by all means \u2014 I don't know German \u2014 at least, not colloquially,\" he replied in some confusion, and hastened to change the subject. \" You need not fear any undue interference with your methods, on my part. I regard the Principal's main duty to be that of preserving discipline, which appears to me of first importance. Without firm and judicious discipline, it is my theory, the best disposed lads would soon degenerate into a band of 'Ottentots \u2014 Hottentots,\" he caught him self quickly up, peering askance at me to see if I had noticed the slip. I, for my part, looked down upon the well-worn carpet, not to catch his eye. My respect for this pretentious preceptor was fast vanishing under the"], [24, "A Sclwolmaster's Stories. 12 revelations of his garrulity. With all the sim plicity that makes me inclined to take people at their own estimate, I am blessed with a certain sense of humour that often stands one in good stead in dealing with a humbug. What will this man be at fifty if he is so prematurely pompous at little more than twenty-five? I could not help wondering, Avhen he rose, sAvelling himself like a bull-frog on the shabby hearth-rug, and putting his hands under his coat tails, in which dignified attitude he delivered himself as folloAvs: \"The discipline of my establishment you will find admirable. I have introduced the system borrowed from the late Dr Arnold and from Tom Brown's Schooldays\u2014 -a work no doubt familiar to you \u2014 the system, I mean, of appealing to the higher instincts and trusting the gentlemanly feel ings, as practised in our great public schools. My pupils love and respect me as a father and a friend. No severe punishments, no violence, no outbursts of temper, are sanctioned on the part of my masters, Avhom, nevertheless, I am ahvays ready to support Avith the full weight of my authority in maintaining order. You will bear this in mind ?\" \" Certainly,\" I murmured, feeling as if I had already been found guilty of harshness. At the same time, it apprehensively occurred to me that if the Tom Brown tone Avere cultivated in this school, I might find the boys rather a restive set to drive in harness, who would need the curb, not to say the whip. My new Principal little knew"], [25, "The Vice-Principal. 13 me, if he judged it necessary to caution me against over-masterfulness. But his precepts had no such personal application as I was inclined to give them. All he wanted was the hearing himself hold forth. \" I have often thought and said,\" he resumed, with the weighty manner of one who would enun ciate some new truth, \" that a schoolmaster's first qualities should be sympathy, patience, gentleness. He must consider those innocent and tender natures given over into his charge.\" At this point the door burst open, and there bounced in a boy with a very dirty face, portentous as his who \"drew Priam's curtain at the dead of night,\" and stood panting and staring, in act to speak, Avhen the Doctor turned sharply upon him, nettled at having his OAvn mellifluous eloquence thus cut short, \u2014 \"Wilks Major! How dare you, sir, intrude in this unmannerly way upon my private apartment ! How often have I told you always to knock at the door and obtain permission before entering ? Go out, you unmannerly lout, and present yourself properly.\" Deeply abashed, Wilks Major retired in haste. \" Stop a moment ! \" cried the Doctor. \" Shut the door quietly, \u2014 our Prefect of Hall for the week,\" he explained to me. \" Responsible for order out of school hours.\" A loud knock followed, in answer to which the Prefect of Hall received leave to enter in due form."], [26, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 14 \" Now then, what do you want ? It is very annoying I can't have a moment's leisure without being pestered by you felloAvs. And why don't you wash your face before you come here? Go and do it this instant, then Avrite out a hundred times, Cleanliness is next to Godliness. After that I will hear what you have to say.\" \" Please, sir, I want to t-t-tell you ,\" stam mered Wilks, in high excitement, but Avas overawed into silence. \"Not a word, sir! Obey me this instant, or I double your imposition,\" cried the Doctor, frowning and puffing himself out like a dwarf Jupiter. \" Leave the room ! \" But still the boy held his ground, and again opened his mouth to speak. Struggling with breathless confusion, he at last managed to blurt out, \" Please, sir \u2014 the house is on fire ! \" \"Why didn't you say so before, you donkey?\" roared Dr Spick, and, suddenly startled out of his Olympian attitude, he made a dart through the door, followed by the young messenger of evil, then more deliberately by myself, who, after short reflection, judged this no occasion for standing upon ceremony. Guided by a great hubbub of voices, I came into a room at the other end of the passage. It was full of smoke, through which I saw a group of boys crowded about the fireplace. One, who should rather be called a young man, for he had whiskers and a tail coat, was routing up the chimney Avith a broom-stick, bringing down heaps"], [27, "The Vice-Principal. 15 of soot, to darken the clouds that belched forth and set the Principal coughing in his anxious demands as to Avhat might be the matter. \" It's all right, sir,\" said the whiskered youth, coming out of the fireplace. \" Some fellow sent a paper bag up the chimney and it stuck, that's all. But I think the vent is open now.\" Indeed the smoke began to take its proper course, and, relieved from the fear of fire, I could look about me, wondering if I saw the whole of the Royal Southern Collegiate Institution. The room was an ordinary parlour, barely furnished with desks and benches. There Avere about a dozen boys in all, from flaxen-haired urchins in knicker bockers to that big fellow, who towered above the rest like a son of Kish. Noticing my presence, Dr Spick made an effort at commanding himself, and introduced me to the whiskered one. \" Mardon, the Captain of the School \u2014 my new Vice-Principal.\" Master Mardon looked me all over from head to foot, and stood loutishly silent, as if not sure what to do about it. Finally, he decided on holding out a sooty hand, which I took, murmuring an expres sion of hope that we should get on together. I had looked forward with some nervousness to meeting my pupils, and now the Captain's budding whiskers were altogether too much for me. But Dr Spick soon helped me out of my embarrassment by entering upon an inquisition as to the stopped up chimney. \" I insist on knowing who has played such a"], [28, "16 A Schoolmaster's Stories. mischievous trick. Fooling Avith fire is not to be tolerated. I take this matter out of the hands of the Prefects. The boy shall be flogged. Let him give himself up without delay.\" None of them showed any forwardness to respond to this invitation, though the master repeated it in his loudest voice, ruffling like a turkey-cock. He was evidently Avorking himself up to violence, and a scene of corporal punishment seemed like to be enacted at my first appearance upon the scholastic stage, the prospect of which made me feel very uncomfortable. Sooner or later, I supposed, I should have to steel my nerves to the infliction of such \" Avholesome anguish,\" but this Avould make a painful beginning. Perhaps it might even enter into a Vice-Principal's duties to hold the victim down. \" I am determined to have his name,\" cried the Principal. \" Mardon, it is your duty to report a case of flagrant misconduct. Who, I demand, I request, I insist, who sent a paper bag up the chimney?\" \" I think it was Pereira,\" muttered the Captain of the School ; and the others shoved to the front an oily-looking, dark-skinned youth of fifteen or so, Avho at first sight could be told for some kind of half-caste. \" I Avas only trying to make a balloon,\" he muttered sulkily, and one or two of his companions giggled. \" Pereira, I am astonished at you,\" said the Doctor, suddenly lowering his tone. \" After my"], [29, "The Vice-Principal. 17 promoting you to the position of senior Prefect, you should give up such lower school puerilities. Don't do it again. For the present you will come Avith me to be kept out of mischief. Mardon,\" he added in a confidential tone, \"Ave need not mention this little matter to Mrs Spick \u2014 it would annoy her too much. Perhaps you can get some one to sweep and dust out the room. The Prefect of Studies ought to see to it.\" I thought I saw a wink and a faint grin pass among the boys at the mention of Mrs Spick, Avhose acquaintance I felt the more curiosity to make. These signs the Principal did not notice, but strutted out as consequentially as a field marshal, I coming after him, and Pereira a little Avay behind. I could scarcely be sure Avhether this youth Avere not still being led off to execution, till Dr Spick, premising that Ave were now to have supper, explained in a whisper his accompanying us \u2014 \" A peculiar case \u2014 a native of a tropical country, for whom his friends have desired a more intimate association with the comforts of our home circle.\" \" Oh, a parlour-boarder ! \" said I, translating this fine phrase. \" H'm \u2014 not precisely,\" mumbled he, but here we entered another room, in which Mrs Spick was sitting in state. \" The Vice-Principal, my dear ! \" The mistress honoured this introduction Avith a mincing simper. I know not what change in her husband's manner at once gave me the idea that li"], [30, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 18 she was in every sense mistress here. At first sight, moreover, I saw that she was a good deal older than he, dressed with a ridiculous mixture of pretentiousness and dowdiness which could not escape even my uncritical eyes, and her manner a painful affectation of airs and graces much out of keeping with her commonplace looks. She was short and dumpy, with small screwed-up eyes and a sharp little nose upon the pasty, puckered face of a woman Avho has spent many years in making stretched ends meet, yet she seemed to be imitating some duchess in the elaborate graciousness of the reception she accorded me. \" This is not your first visit to Brighton, sir ? \" she said. \"You have come at the most fashionable season.\" \" I am afraid it is ; I have never been here before,\" I had to admit, feeling that I already sunk in her estimation. \" Never !\" she exclaimed, casting up her eyes, as if calling heaven to witness that such things Avere ; and now she reminded me of Angelo Cyrus Bantam, Esq.,expressingsimilar astonishment toMrPickwick under similar circumstances. \" Pereira, ring the bell for Ditcherly.\" Master Pereira, still looking sulky, showed no readiness in obeying this command ; then the Principal rang the bell. I expected to see it answered by a footman or a boy in buttons at least ; but Ditcherly turned out to be no other than the maid-of-all-work that had ushered me into the establishment, the imagined proportions"], [31, "The Vice-Principal. 19 of which were so fast shrinking in the light of near acquaintance. \" Ditcherly, supper ! \" quoth Mrs Spick with the air of a tragedy queen. Supper was already on the table in the shape of bread and cheese and the end of a cold leg of mutton ; but the lady accompanied her command by secretly slipping a key into Ditcherly's hand, Avhereupon this discreet damsel retired, and pre sently returned with a small jug of beer. \"Supper is served, m'm,\" she said, with a' gravity no doubt schooled upon her ; but I saw how she hardly choked down a giggle when Pereira winked at her Avith his tongue in his cheek. I began to dislike this dubious fellow-countryman. Evidently Mrs Spick had no suspicion of being laughed at, for an empress could not have sat down with more stateliness than she did to preside over the cold mutton, to Avhich she helped us sparingly, and made Ditcherly hand round the pickles with a silver fork upon a japanned tray, in due form. Her husband, I noticed, had not nearly so much to say in his wife's presence. She led the conversation, direct ing it to such high themes as the Court, the Fashions, Society ; and the Principal seemed hardly more at home than myself in that genteel tittle-tattle. I, indeed, had very little to say on any subject, being tired and put out by the disenchantments that kept encountering me. Mrs Spick soon gave me up as having no familiarity Avith the lofty circles in which her ideas moved,"], [32, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 20 and addressed herself chiefly to Pereira, who came out of his sulks, and seemed to me to show a certain Oriental readiness in flattering the good lady to the top of her bent. If I disliked him, he was clearly a favourite in this quarter. Her ogling and simpering manner towards him put me in mind of a motherly Titania all but fondling a dusky Bottom ; and when the creature asked for a second help of cheese, I had a notion that if he expressed a mind to a pottle of anything more costly, she would have forthwith ordered Ditcherly to bring it on a German-silver salver. Towards myself, the mistress no doubt meant to be kind, for, supper soon over, she suggested that the boys might be sent to bed Avithout my assisting at the ceremony, and that, presently, I should no doubt be glad to see my room. Dr Spick's spirits visibly rose at the call to perform his pedagogic functions. \"Ditcherly, open the door for your master.\" The Principal, having vested himself in a cap and gown hanging behind the door, now stalked forth Avith much dignity, followed by Pereira, after he had exchanged an affectionate good-night Avith his elegant patroness. When the snuffling Ditcherly had cleared the table, I found myself left alone with Mrs S., and for Avant of anything else to say, remarked that her maid appeared to have a bad cold. \" Yes,\" she answered, in a tone of languid complaint. \" These people are the trouble of my life. I can get on with the boys well enough \u2014"], [33, "The Vice-Principal. 21 they are a very gentlemanly set. This young gentleman who has his meals with us at the high table is an officer's son.\" \" Indeed !\" said I, seeing that some such assent was looked for. \" Yes,\" she proceeded, complacently, \" and several of our parents have very high connections.\" After pausing to let this statement sink into my mind, she Avent on to inform me \u2014 as if I might be surprised to find such elegant refinement in a so commonplace position \u2014 that she had always been accustomed to boys. Her family were in the scholastic line, but only in the higher branches, she would have me know. One of her brothers was a Dublin University man, and second master at a grammar school ; another, professor at a college in Belgium, \u2014 by this statement she clearly meant me to be much impressed. Her mother had been principal of a fashionable seminary for young ladies. Her father was once well known as head of an establishment for young gentlemen at Camberwell. In his later years, he had removed to Brighton for the benefit of the air and the society. From this hint I at once constructed, in my imagination, the Avhole story of her marriage, which proved to be not far from the truth, a parody on that old romance of the king's daughter and the squire of low degree, \u2014 a vain and foolish woman who saw herself verging on hopeless spinsterhood, an aspiring usher who had seized this chance of succeeding to the business, a fond couple Avho"], [34, "A Sclwolmaster's Stories. 22 were both humbugs in their own way, but, perhaps, without shreAvdness enough to see through each other's folly. Ignorant as I was of real life, I had a tolerably large acquaintance with men and Avomen in books, and could put .this and that together not so short-sightedly at times ; so now I guessed how Dr Spick had become Principal of a school at his age. How he came to be a doctor of any kind, I was still too simple to do more than wonder. But his mature helpmeet had no notion of all the confidences being on her side. I presently found myself put through an examination as to my antecedents, relations, and experiences of the Avorld. To such catechising, hoAvever, I was in no mood to respond. This vulgar woman's blandishments and affectations made me draAV back all the more into my shell. And she, disgusted at my uncommunicativeness, gave me up as a rude despiser of good manners. So conversation flagged between us, and to me, at least, it was a relief when the Principal came back. Mrs Spick simpered out she was sure I must be tired. I hesitated in taking the hint, only because I should have liked a little turn in the open air, to think over my disillusions. Her husband observed this, and, perhaps not unwilling to give me another innings of his own eloquence, suggested that I might want to have a smoke before going to bed. \" Dr Spick ! \" rebuked the lady in such an awful voice, that, disclaiming any desire of the kind, I"], [35, "The Vice-Principal. 23 hastened to say good-night, lest I should excite domestic discord. \" H'm, my Avife doesn't like it; and it is a bad example to the boys,\" said the Principal, as he shoAved me upstairs ; but I set his mind at rest by assuring him I had no habits that might not become a Vice-Principal. When he introduced me into my room, his manner betrayed a certain apologetic doubt as to Avhat I might think of it; and indeed, a Vice- Principal should have been better lodged. It Avas a narrow, scantily-furnished den, partitioned off by thin boards from the next room, in which could be heard the noise of boys going to bed. \" You have here under your immediate super intendence one of the dormitories \u2014 -'Carthage,' Ave call it. The other dormitory, ' Rome,' is on my floor, and Mrs Spick and I are responsible for its discipline. The Captain of the School sleeps in his OAvn study. We breakfast at eight ; and, during the Avinter term, early morning school and chapel are done away with. Good-night.\" With this, he suddenly took himself off, as if afraid I might begin to complain of my accom modation. At the sound of his voice, the chatter ing boys had fallen silent, but now I heard them tittering in subdued tones, and fancied they must be making fun of me. I was in the mood to fancy everything unpleasant. There was nothing for it but to undress and go to bed, not without carefully examining it to be sure the boys had played no tricks; I had heard"], [36, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 24 of such things. I lay down with the most dismal anticipations of what would come from having bound myself a slave to this pair of pretenders. Yet there Avas a humorous side to the predicament. In my own mind I nicknamed them Admetus and Alcestis, and presumptuously compared my case Avith Apollo's in the service of mortals. This idea tickled me into a little sense of comfort. My employers were, at least, not a couple to be much afraid of. But the boys \u2014 if they turned out to be unruly flibbertigibbets, Avas their vainly pompous Principal the man to shield my meekness against them ? I had always been conscious that I was a little afraid of boys. Now that my preconcep tions of a headmaster failed me, I feared sorely to be left naked to such natural enemies. But if these boys were laughing in their sleeves at me, it did not last long. I heard a gruff voice bidding the others \"shut up,\" and presently soft-winged silence settled upon all \" Carthage.\" Could they guess how uneasy lay the head that wore Avhatever emblems might befit a Vice- Principal ? On my side of the partition I tossed and tumbled for an hour or two, till at length I also fell asleep, to dream of the crystal caves and mossy grots with which I had filled my head by reading Keats on the downward journey. My last conscious thought was a line from Endymion \u2014 \" Why should I tarry here ? \""], [37, "The Vice- Principal. 25 II. NEXT morning I awoke before any but the faintest patch of daAvn stole in through the sky light, that was the only Avindow of my chamber. I could not consult my watch ; but the ringing of a bell presently suggested that it Avas time to get up, as I did forthwith, having no mind to lie still in this stifling den. Then the boys in the next room began to bestir themselves, and I heard them splashing, chuckling, and chevying one another about in a subdued way, that showed some recognition of my being within ear-shot. Not Avishing to be any restraint upon them, I quickly finished dressing and found my way doAvnstairs, thence out of doors to a puddly gravelled en closure, Avhich a small show of gymnastic bars in one corner proclaimed to be the playground. Looking at the house by daylight, I saw hoAV the back of it Avas painted in huge letters Avith the name that had so much imposed upon me, Royal Southern Collegiate Institution. Its names seemed to be the strong point of this establishment. Now that I could examine its proportions, the Avonder Avas where even so feAV as a dozen boarders might be stowed away in it. My eyes were opened to the imposture of Dr Spick's prospectus. His many-titled seminary was nothing but an adventure school on the smallest scale, and I, the Vice-Principal, would probably compose his whole staff in my own"], [38, "26 A Schoolmaster's Stories. inefficient person, he himself little better than an ignorant quack. In the plainest light I saAV the position into Avhich that scholastic agent had sent me, like a pig going to a bad market. But at least the Brighton air was fresh and invigorating ; and on a clear morning one can get the better of apprehensions and regrets that loom hugely oppressive through the shades of night. I am not given to entertaining Ioav spirits for long \u2014 nisi quum pituita molesta est. Now, as I paced the narrow playground and sniffed the anti-bilious sea breeze, I found myself able to take a less downcast view of things. Dr Spick might be a bit of a humbug, but it remained to be shown that he was an impostor of the darkest dye \u2014 a Squeers or a Creakle. If I had judged him aright, he at least believed in himself, and seemed more likely to play the bore than the tyrant. And Avho Avas I that should pretend to any but the lowest offices in the scholastic priesthood ? After my dread to be found wanting in this vocation, I ought even to feel thankful that I had a chance of learning the business of a teacher from small beginnings. The school might not come up to its pretensions, then all the better for my inexperience. I must give it a fair trial, trying to do my duty to this little flock, and fitting myself to act the schoolmaster some day on a better stage. \" Makes that and the action fine ! \" was the last line of a familiar verse that occurred to me as very appropriate, along with several other moral maxims much to"], [39, "The Vice-Principal. 27 the point. I would do my duty, I vowed to the sun, as he rose redly over the chimneys of Brighton and the rubbish heaps and \" Eligible plots of Building Land,\" that chiefly formed the scenery of this suburban quarter. His hopeful light so much inspirited me, that I had almost caught myself whistling \" Cheer, boys, cheer ! \" but repressed such an ebullition when some of the boys came dropping out by tAvos and threes. The sight of them threw a shade over my changing mood. They hung together in a knot at the farther end, glancing toAvards me sideways, and, no doubt, discussing my personal appearance and the chances they augured of being able to come over me. I remembered enough of my own boyhood to enter into their feelings. Indeed, my present plight took me vividly back to my first day at school : it seemed as if I were a new boy once more, and as if these fellows might presently press round me asking my name and who was my father. Since they hung back, I felt it incumbent on me to take the initiative of sociability. Boldly I walked up to the group, in which I recognised my acquaintance of the evening before, Wilks Major, to whom I addressed myself, asking pleasantly if he had got over the scare of the house being on fire. Wilks was evidently a shy lad, for at this simple question, he blushed up to the roots of a very fine shock of curly hair, that for long could not have \"known the barber's shears.\" Then another boy undertook to answer for him."], [40, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 28 \" He's all right, sir. We shoved Wilks up the chimney to sweep it with his head. All the sweeps in Brighton are always trying to steal him\u2014 he makes such a good brush for smoky chimneys.\" This personality in the true schoolboy style set the others tittering, Avhile I looked hard at the communicative youth, a saucy-eyed fellow with the air of being on very good terms with himself and all the world. \" What is your name, please ? \" I asked him, since he seemed so disposed to introduce himself. \" Walker,\" was the answer, in such a roguish tone that I regarded him severely, as who would have him knoAV I Avas not one to be made game of. Why this common name should have been appropriated to the genius of disbelief and departure, I know not, but so it is. The boy hastened to meet my suspicion. \" Honour bright, sir \u2014 it is Walker, right enough. The fellows call me Hookey, but that's only their cheek.\" \" And Avhat are you called ? \" I asked another, a lank, lean boy with his sleeves and trouser legs too short for his limbs, and the doleful look of one for whom all the world was out of joint. \" Skinny,\" Walker answered for him, at which the boys laughed, and I, making a mental note of it, was half sure I had got hold of a nickname this time, but thought well to take no notice of the familiarity. \"You have come to teach us Latin and such like,\" Master Walker went on in his jovial Avay."], [41, "T/te Vice-Principal. 29 \"Well, it isn't easy work, sir. Takes a steam roller to get the irregular verbs into me. The last master but one drowned himself because Wilks stuck so fast in the first declension ; and two more of them are in the asylum \u2014 Skinny's exercises drove them mad.\" \" I Avish the man that invented Latin had been drowned before he was born,\" muttered the so called Skinny, gloomily. \" But I Avant to learn Latin,\" laughed a bright little chap. \" I should like to be a schoolmaster myself when I am big. Won't I make the boys slave at it ! Such fun to pitch into them ! \" \"You'll have to slave yourself first, then \u2014 unless you pay a fellow to come and teach for you,\" quoth Walker, glancing at me to see how I took this allusion to Dr Spick, so I guessed it to be, Avhich was received with a general grin. \"Ah ! but you needn't know anything yourself; the boys have to tell you,\" said Skinny, with a bitterness as of experience. This talk made me rather uneasy, both because it seemed to trench on the respect due to a Vice-Principal, and because it Avent to my heart to find that these boys looked on me as the stoker of some hateful engine of mental torture. But now a bell rang long and loud, which I understood as summoning us to breakfast, with such alacrity was it obeyed by the boys. I went with them, and at the door met Dr Spick, already arrayed in cap and gown and a pair of carpet slippers."], [42, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 30 He greeted me effusively, then drawing aside, passed his little flock in revieAv, as if willing to find some occasion of exercising magisterial functions. He found one in the unfortunate Skinny, who happened to have a faded chrysan themum in the button-hole of his threadbare jacket. \"Where did you get that, sir?\" asked the critical pedagogue. \" Pereira gave it me,\" mumbled the boy, casting down his eyes. \" I detest such foppery in fags,\" quoth the Principal, Avith all the ipse dixit air of a Samuel Johnson. \"Throw it away, and understand that you are gated for a week.\" Skinny sullenly obeyed ; but his depressed looks must have been more a matter of manner than of grief, for this punishment of \" gating \" could be no very serious one Avhen, as I soon learned, the boys were never allowed to leave the premises Avithout special permission. Into the \" hall,\" as Dr Spick called it, they all filed to range themselves along the board spread Avith plates of bread and butter, at the head of Avhich was a cross-piece knoAvn as the \" high table,\" where he indicated my place beside his own presidential chair, Pereira and the \" Captain of the School \" being on each side of us. Thus we stood silent for a minute or tAvo and nothing happened. I wondered Avhat we were Avaiting for, till Ditcherly, her arms filled with a huge coffee urn, kicked open the door to admit Mrs S., who"], [43, "The Vice- Principal. 31 Avaddled up the room with her Brummagem duchess mien, bowing condescendingly in acknow ledgment of perfunctory bobs from the boys. Reaching the head of the table, she saluted the principal personages of the assembly, on some such graduated scale of courtesy as Hamlet shows in the welcome of his friends, giving me as stranger the lion's or Horatio's share of her wrinkled smiles. Then the Principal knocked with a knife handle, at which signal, Wilks Major as \"Prefect of Hall \" mumbled a short Latin grace, perpetrat ing more than one false quantity that would have made some of our scholastic Quintilians stare and gasp, but had no such effect on Dr Spick. All ceremonies being thus complied with, we sat down to our meal, consisting of bread and butter, with the remnants of the cold mutton from supper for us high-table guests, among whom it seemed to me that Pereira had Benjamin's portion in the knuckle end. I don't wish to give any false impression of the fare at Dr Spick's establishment. The bread was coarse, the butter Avas salt, the coffee was thin ; but, so far as I could see, there was no desire to stint the boys in these victuals, such as they were, nothing of the Dotheboys' Hall style. As before, the Principal sat comparatively silent in presence of his wife, Avho, under the effort to be genteelly civil to me, puckered her puffy face into the most absurd dimples, while she dispensed the coffee and kept a watchful eye along the table for any signs of waste or wantonness."], [44, "A Sclwolmaster's Stories. 32 \"So vulgar!\" she exclaimed, with a look of disgust, when she caught one of the boys spilling his coffee in the act of pouring it into the saucer ; and her husband, acting on the hint, at once ordered the culprit three days' \"gating.\" After breakfast, and a short interval which Dr Spick spent in holding forth to me on the excellence of his methods and the high \" tone \" of his school, the trying hour came on when I must be introduced to my pupils. The Principal seemed much concerned to find that my scholastic garb had not yet arrived in a trunk despatched by goods' train ; but, that I might make a proper appearance, he lent me a gown of his own, \"the one I use for teaching science in,\" he explained, as if a change of vestment were necessary for this function. It bore marks, indeed, of applied science, and was somewhat scrimp for my stature, so that I felt rather like a raw undergraduate, as I formed the tail of the procession of two which entered the schoolroom at the summons of the bell, tolled in an outhouse by the hands of that generally useful Ditcherly, Avho, to-day, Avas mani festly suffering from toothache. The schoolroom turned out to be a long, Ioav excrescence at the back, which I had already puzzled over; I fancy this must have been built for a doctor's house, and that his surgery or waiting-room had been adapted to scholastic purposes. At the farther end was a lofty throne for the Principal, Avhere, his head almost touching the ceiling, he took his seat in state against a"], [45, "The Vice- Principal. 33 background of black board, after I had been inducted into the humbler rostrum, where I felt uneasily how all eyes were turned upon me. The boys were already standing at their desks, some score of them at the most, their numbers increased by a few day-scholars. Proceedings began with a prayer in Latin, delivered ore rotundo by the Principal, Avhile I fear my edification was spoiled through Avondering if he could construe it. Then the Captain of the School, Master Whiskerandos, called the roll, to Avhich each boy stood up and answered adsum, a very unnecessary ceremony it seemed to me, since it need take no C\u00e6sar to recognise at a glance the presence of so feAv soldiers. But my employer was evidently nothing if not scholastical in his ideas. Finally, he made a speech presenting me to the boys, Avho more than once broke out in applause, to my modest confusion. They seemed quite aware of their preceptor's weakness, and well disposed to encourage him in Avasting their school time on wordy orations. He, for his part, appeared to be in his element so long as he heard himself talking to a respectful audience. \" Let me see,\" he concluded, examining a time table which hung over his desk, as if the smallest boy in the school must not have known it by heart. \" The modern side and the fifth and sixth forms come up to me. The fourth and the shell do classical work this morning with the Vice-Principal.\" The sixth and fifth forms consisted respectively of Mardon with his Avhiskers and of Pereira, unless c"], [46, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 34 may be counted another youth, a day boy of shabby and subdued aspect, acting in part as a sort of pupil-teacher to the half-dozen smaller boys who, inasmuch as they did not learn Latin, were dignified with the title of the \" modern side.\" These latter the Principal at once set to doing sums, that at least kept them quiet ; while the big fellows were supposed to work at something of the same sort, which he called \" mathematics,\" though for all he knew to the contrary, I fancy, they may have spent the time in writing letters to themselves, like Mr Toots, or in drawing skeletons like Tommy Traddles. The rest of the school I found handed over to me ; and my superior, after making them bring up their books to my desk, fled to his own, as if afraid to be called upon for inconvenient explanations. I doubt if a conscript for the first time under fire ever felt so nervous as did I when now I saw this semicircle of boys ranged before me like hungry sheep, looking up and like not to be fed. On consideration I am not sure that they were hungry, unless to note hoAV I should deport myself. The first step is the one that costs, and mine stuck for a minute or two at turning over their books with a critical air meant to hide my hesitation. I had understood my flock to be differentiated into two parts, and Master Walker, who put himself forward as my mentor, informed me as to an elementary matter of organisation. \" One lot sits down and learns something, you know, sir, while the other is saying.\""], [47, "The Vice-Principal. 35 \" Of course,\" said I, glad of the hint, upon which I acted by ordering the lower division to sit down and learn the verb amo off by heart. Then I turned my full attention to the seniors, who had Henry's First Latin Book, or some such manual, with scraps of Latin and English for translation, in alternate paragraphs. \" Now, what have you prepared ? \" was my first question. \" Nothing,\" replied Walker, cheerfully. \" You see, sir, Ave haven't done any Latin since the last master left. He left in a hurry. But I'll show you hoAV far Ave had got.\" I came to understand afterwards that my pre decessor's \" resignation,\" as Dr Spick put it, had indeed been sudden, and not altogether uncon nected Avith the police. At the mention of him a subdued grin went round among the boys. I saAV the Principal looking our way Avith a magisterial frown, and to show that I could keep order for myself, determined to come down on the very first sign of disorder. Just then I caught a little flaxen haired urchin tittering outright at a whisper from his neighbour. \" What are you about, sir ? \" I said in my sternest tones. I was at no loss how to bear myself in such an emergency, having taken care to sketch out in advance how I should treat any attempt to presume on my inexperience. For answer the untimely laugher's face twitched anxiously, overcast with terror and shame, and he had not a word to say for himself."], [48, "36 A Schoolmaster's Stories. \" What is your name?\" I demanded, giving him a little shake. \" Downes, please, sir,\" he gasped out almost inaudibly, and forthwith burst into tears. This emotion put me out of all my severity, prepared as I was for dealing with some hardened offender. Now that he stood weeping and trembling before me, I had no heart to play the tyrant over him. \"Why were you laughing in school?\" I said in milder accents, as willing to make excuse for myself. Still Master Downes wept sorely, the tears rolling down his snub nose and ruddy cheeks, and seemed incapable of offering any defence. Then Walker volunteered to be his advocate. \" Downes is always laughing at nothing, sir. He can't help it any more than a dog wagging its tail. He would half choke himself if you told him tAvo and two make four.\" \" Oh ! \" said I, gladly accepting this apology, for I felt rather ashamed of having made a boy cry on such slight cause, and took a mental memorandum not to let off my big guns again till I were sure a popgun Avould not meet the case. But how was I to have knoAvn this boy had his feelings thus set on a hair trigger ? \" That will do, Downes. Never mind, but don't laugh again when you ought to be listening. I am not angry with you, my boy : there is nothing to cry about.\" But the shower-bath whose string I had pulled,"], [49, "The Vice-Principal. 37 went on pouring more than ever, till I seared the Principal Avould see it and tax me with bullying. Luckily his attention was taken up at the other end of the room in setting copies or something of that sort for the \" fifth form.\" Then Walker again put in his word. \" You mustn't mind DoAvnes, sir. When he isn't laughing he is ahvays crying; it is his nature to. We have measured fifty-four inches of tears per annum, not counting Sundays, when he cries all day long over his letters home. That's Avhy the sea is so salt at Brighton, because Downes weeps into it Avhenever he gets a chance.\" At this all the boys giggled, and even the sobbing Downes' face began to clear up with an April change. I looked rebukefully at the over-familiar youth, and, to silence his facetious ness, set him \" on \" at the first sentence of one of the exercises. Clearing his throat with a great air of importance, he confidently read out the English, then began to translate. \" Balbus\u2014 Balbus.\" \" Very good.\" \"Balbus\" repeated this advanced scholar, and stuck fast. \" So far, so good. Balbus was shutting the gates of the city. What is the Latin for was shutting ? \" \" Esse,\" hazarded Walker. I stared at him to make sure he Avas not making fun of me; but his countenance expressed genuine ignorance."], [50, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 38 \" That's not the way we do,\" he volunteered to instruct me. \"The last master always told us the Latin; then we said it.\" \"Is that all you know?\" I exclaimed in dis gust. \"Well, sir, if I knew Latin, do you think I would come to school to learn it ? \" retorted Walker. After all, there was something in this way of putting the matter, so, overlooking the imp's pertness, and resolved to proceed by degrees, I now laid myself out to explain in a style which, I judged, should bring the mysteries of translation down to the meanest capacity. The boys listened with natural interest in the utterances of a new master, and seemed to be drinking in my lucid instructions with profitable attention ; but, when I invited them to put these precepts in practice, it Avas another story. Such a bungle of blunders as they made of Balbus, Caius, and tout le tremble ment! Such concords \u2014 such a muddle of masculine adjectives stuck on to feminine substantives \u2014 such a mess of nominatives that ought to have been accusatives, and singulars for plurals \u2014 such an utter bewilderment between subject and object, verb and noun ! All my grammatical conceptions were at fault, and I kneAv not how to make these ignoramuses understand that if Balbus irritated a wasp, they must catch the wasp by its accusative to put it properly into the sentence, that it did not take a plural slave to shut the gates of the city, that, when Caius was praising Balbus, he"], [51, "The Vice-Principal. 39 did it Avith one Avord in Latin to two in English, and so forth. Like so many parrots, the boys repeated anything I told them, but seemed no Avhit the wiser in applying my rules to the next case of a poet's daughter's gender, or the genitive of her papa. After half an hour of such Sisyphus work, I began to hate the very names of Balbus and Caius, as much as some one else must have done, who, on the dog's-eared page before me, had scraAvled in pencil, \"Balbus est unus stultus et Caius alius,\" as, to his mind, the upshot of the Avhole matter. To make my task harder, the Principal had begun to give what he called a lecture upon history, and as he spoke in a somewhat loud voice, I could not help being distracted by the dogmas he was laying down under that name. I heard him thus inculcating upon the trustful minds of youth, that Archbishop Laud Avas a blessed martyr, who suffered through his zeal for the principles of the Reformation, that Crom well was once his secretary as Avell as a wicked man, who, from childhood, had desired to make himself king, that the Quakers originally came from America to stir up republicanism at home, and that Paradise Lost was written to solace the poet's grief for the execution of Charles I. ! What puzzled me was how the man had such a floAv of Avords, and such a belief in his own wisdom along Avith so flagrant ignorance. He showed no suspicion of himself; indeed, I fancied that he was pitching his voice a little higher that I, too,"], [52, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 40 might have an opportunity of admiring such erudition ; but the effect was to Avorry me even more than did the honest crassness of my pupils. After a time, Dr Spick set his \"modern side\" Avriting, and came to stand by my prelections with a critical air that made me quite nervous, though I was now rather afraid of his exposing himself than finding fault with me. \" Very good, very fair,\" he said, encouragingly. \"But you should make them parse more. Parsing is the root of sound grammatical knowledge.\" I looked away from him, and my averted gaze fell on Walker, who distinctly Avinked at me Avith one of his sharp black eyes. This would never do ; I could not take the boys as accomplices in my knoAvledge of their headmaster's ignorance, so I answered the wink with a froAvn, and Walker's countenance at once assumed a shade of preter natural gravity. \" I am sorry I must leave the school in your hands,\" said Dr Spick, \" I have an important engagement in the town. In half an hour they go out into the quadrangle for a short recreation. Second school begins at eleven.\" With a few more instructions as to the employ ment of the various forms, he stalked out, leaving the whole burden of office on my shoulders. I had afterwards reason to believe that his engagement was, indeed, an urgent one, being nothing less than a summons to the county court ; but, at the time, I thought it most inconsiderate of him to trust an untried Vice-Principal so far."], [53, "The Vice- Principal. 41 No sooner was his back turned than first Mardon, then Pereira, shut up their desks and slipped out of the room Avithout a word to me. The disrespect implied in this breach of discipline hurt me a little, but I was not sure whether I ought to stop them, and felt, on the whole, rather Avell pleased to be rid of these big fellows, that I might turn my undivided attention to my backward classical scholars. I now discovered that they had another book called Delectus, in which I hoped they might show more proficiency. Selecting a Avell-thumbed page, Avhich looked as if it ought to be familiar to them, I first of all translated one of its Latin sentences, then called on the boy to whom I had been introduced as Skinny. \"Nox \u2014 it was,\" he began in a drawling, discon solate tone, \" erat \u2014 night.\" \"Stupid fellow ! \" I interrupted him, almost losing my temper, and he shrank back as if expecting a blow. \" What am I to do with a boy who can make such blunders ? \" \" Put some more sense into me,\" mumbled Skinny, in an almost inaudible voice ; but I caught the words, and they Avent to my heart with a recollection of Dr Arnold and the triste lupus story. After all there Avas nothing for it but patience. Why should I be angry with these boys, because they Avere dense and ill taught ? So I restrained myself Avith an effort, floundering on through the wilderness of their blunders, while I had, at the same time, to look after the other division, who,"], [54, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 42 having made a pretence of learning their lessons, were engaged in playing tricks on each other. Daniel in the den of lions had probably not two sets of young cubs to keep an eye upon, else I pity his case. What irony seemed to lurk in these simple sentences Magister docet \u2014 Pueri discunt, Avhich we duly translated, discussed, and parsed \u2014 that is, I did so and the boys after me. Presently I set doAvn what Dr Spick termed the \" shell \" to learn amo in their turn, as they were evidently in much need of it, and called up the \" fourth form \" to \" say,\" which they did in a fashion that at some schools would have led to an active conjugation of the verb tupto. Heartily glad Avas I, Avhen that cool fish, Walker, who had taken on himself to coach the neAV master in the ways of school life, informed me that it was now playtime. I willingly let them go, and, as romping and shouting they rushed out, I sank back with a sigh into my magisterial chair, the back of Avhich suddenly cracked, nearly throwing me on to the floor. It was just as well the boys had not witnessed this little accident, since already I found myself so hard put to it to keep up my dignity among them. I turned their absence to profit by trying to remember how matters Avere managed by the instructors of my OAvn youth. I found my mind very blank on the subject, beyond a vague impression that our giddy wits had been kept humming by frequent applications of the same kind as are made to a top. Details had escaped"], [55, "The Vice- Principal. 43 me; somehoAV or other thus the master taught, the boys learned. Noav, had I been ever so much of a Busby at heart, Dr Spick's establishment Avas too highly infused with the spirit of the age to admit the whipping-top theory of pedagogics. \" Wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.\" The modern teacher, I recognised, must cudgel his own brains and no longer the bodies of his pupils. By dint of rubbing up my memories, I struck out a spark of light. I recalled an old north country dominie who had a capital way of teach ing us Latin grammar through artfully disguising it as sport. Taking a given verb or declension, he would allow the boys to puzzle one another Avith challenges upon it ; or he would ask a cunningly contrived question, for instance, Avhat was the first person singular imperative passive of amo, and after pausing a moment to let us all think of it, would name a boy, who, if he did not at once come out with the answer, might have it snapped from his mouth by the next beloAv him, and be duly taken up, losing his place to the readier neighbour. This game of \"first outs\" had lent a certain excitement to our dull school hours ; and I resolved to try how it would work here. Eager to begin my new experiment, I sat Avaiting for the boys to come in from their play, impatiently and in vain, till it occurred to me they would not come till I went to call them. So I did, and in they came, rather reluctantly, as was hardly fair on their part, seeing I had let them"], [56, "A Schoolmaster s Stories. 44 have tAvice as much play as they had any right to. \" Oh, sir ! \" expostulated the pert Walker, \" I had an idea you Avere going to give us half an hour longer, because it is your first day.\" \" There are various respects in which your ideas require correcting,\" quoth I, with a Aveak attempt at repressive sarcasm. Setting the \"modern side\" to write copies, \u2014 what an occupation for a Vice-Principal! \u2014 I ranked all the others in a circle around me, and explained the nature of the drill they were about to be put through. They listened suspiciously, as if fearing some gifts of the Greeks in my proposed pastime ; and for a time it hung fire. But, presently catch ing the spirit of the thing, they began to groAv lively over it, rather too lively, indeed. I had made a mistake in placing myself the centre of the circle, where half these boys Avere always out of my sight, and took a mischievous delight in treating me as the choragus of a game at \"hunt the slipper.\" Nor did they long content themselves with sly pushes, pinches, and general restlessness behind my back ; before my face they gave way to a commotion encouraged by the very nature of the exercise to which I had rashly invited them. The competitors in my trials of quickness found plenty of occasion for quarrelling openly as to which was the winner; two or three boys, when I put a question, would rush out to draw my attention to their readiness ; half a dozen would bawl forth some answer, right or Avrong, all at"], [57, "The Vice- Principal. 45 once, till it came to this that not the dullest of them cared to stand still or to hold his tongue, when so much noise and bustle was going on. In vain I sought to repress their exuberant zeal ; in vain I shouted for order above the din ; in vain I threatened terrible things which I knew not how to perform. That excited crew, their spirits once let loose at my own unlucky instigation, were not to be restrained. Every moment they greAV more uproarious, dancing, screaming, spring ing about the room, till all pretence at minding me was droAvned in the tumult, and the school room seemed about to become the scene of a general bear fight. As I stood in the height of helpless perplexity, the door Avas flung open, and I half hoped, half dreaded to see my Principal appear to the rescue of his incompetent deputy. But it was only Mardon, the \" Captain of the School,\" Avho strode in to fetch something he had left on his desk. Without troubling himself to remove his cap, and taking no more notice of me than if I had been the stove, he threw a prompt rebuke at the rioters. \" Sit down and shut up, you little brutes, or I'll give you all a good clouting.\" This word of power worked like a charm. The whole Comus rout, hushed in a moment, slunk to their desks, and I mounted mine, looking rather foolish, I fear. I can't say I was properly grateful to the timely champion, who made so light of my authority ; and Mardon did not even wait to see"], [58, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 46 that his orders were obeyed, hurrying out as unceremoniously as he had come. But a moment of his presence had been enough to restore order. And now that I had got my unruly geniuses bottled up again, like the fisher man in the Arabian Nights, I did not give them another chance of perilous expansion. I set them down to writing out amo instead of saying it, for I had already learned this first lesson in school craft, to study the means that save the master trouble. Thus, by finding something for their idle hands to do, I managed to preserve a show of quietness and diligence, till the bell rang its welcome summons of dismissal. At the first note, Walker threw down his pen and jumped to his feet, the rest all following the example of this bell-wether ; nor had I the heart to stop their sudden breaking-up. Eagerly as they streamed forth into the \" quadrangle,\" my relief must have been greater than theirs, when I found the fresh air on my flushed face, and left that stifling school room, a line from WordsAvorth leading the tumult in my dazed head, without my quite knowing how it came there \u2014 \" The youth resigned A task he was unable to perform.\" III. After my first essay at school teaching, I had a dull headache, the natural effect of breathing so much bad air, ventilation being ill provided for in"], [59, "The Vice-Principal. 47 Dr Spick's \"system\"; and I felt fit for nothing but to go and lie down on my bed, which had not yet been made. Most unwillingly was I called down stairs by the sound of the bell, no doubt announcing dinner \u2014 a supposition made certain by Master Walker, Avho, as I passed, confidentially remarked to me with a cheerful grin \u2014 \" Pudding day-! \" Outside the dining \"hall,\" I found Mrs Spick, apparently awaiting me. \" The Principal is engaged,\" she said. \" May I trouble you ? \" \" Indeed,\" said I, foreseeing fresh responsibilities ; but did not guess what she would be at till she put her requirements more plainly \u2014 \u2022 \" Will you give me your arm, sir ? \"Oh!\" I made haste to mend the want of manners of Avhich she seemed to accuse me. Then we made our entry in state, I feeling very like a fool as I minced my steps to keep pace with hers, and taking care not to look if the boys were laughing at me. \" We are particular about observing the habits of good society,\" she simpered behind a fan with which she had equipped herself for Avhat she called \" luncheon.\" Just as Ave had finished our progress, and I was handing the lady to her seat, she suddenly made the room ring with a scream of alarm. I thought she would have fallen sainting into my arms. What is it ? \u2014 the horrid thing ! \u2014 take it away! \""], [60, "48 A Schoolmaster's Stories. she gasped, pointing Avith her fan to a part of the table where I could see nothing to excite such agitation. \" Is it a spider ? \" \" No, m'm \u2014 it's only a hole in the cloth,\" grunted Mardon. \" Ah ! \" sighed the lady, dropping into her chair, and turned to me to explain this outburst. \" My poor nerves ! \u2014 you will excuse me \u2014 but all my family are short-sighted. It seems to be a mark of the educated classes.\" \" You may be sure, Mrs Spick, we should not let a spider come near you,\" quoth Pereira, gallantly; and she rewarded him with one of her most high class smiles, though the impudent scamp was almost laughing in her face. After thus escorting the mistress to the head of the table, I found it was now my part to return to the lower end, there to help a huge dish set before me by Ditcherly, whose swollen face, bound up with a handkerchief, did not present an appetising sight. Grace having been said, I set to my task energetically, which indeed this time was no difficult one, for the dish contained a mass of scraps buried beneath a paste of potatoes \u2014 Avhat is known in schools as \" resurrection pie.\" I went on ladling out large platefuls, briskly carried off by my suffering aide-de-camp, till Mrs Spick sent the small maid at her end Avith a whispered message to Ditcherly, who passed it on to me \u2014 \" Please, sir, you are giving them too large helpings for the first time.\" So it seemed, for, though I henceforth exercised"], [61, "The Vice-Principal. 49 economy, when I had gone all round my clients, the dish stood almost empty, Avith nothing left for me but a bit of burned potato crust, which I munched resignedly, telling myself that by degrees I should come to understand the business of school keeping. Presently, however, this dish Avas relieved by a piece of cold salt beef, as to which my monitress whispered me that no boy must have any who had not eaten up all his share of the pie ; then, that Mrs Spick presented her compliments, and requested I would not cut it too thick. I Avas not a practised carver, and the claimants for a second helping soon kept me so busy that I had hardly time to make my OAvn dinner. Next came on the pudding, the entrance of which the boys watched with expectant eyes, and a stifled hum of approval ran round as they saAV deposited at the head and foot of the table, two globes of suet set with raisins by no means so thick as leaves in Vallambrosa. This viand, I believe, is known as \" Stiff Dick,\" or more elegantly as \" Inflexible Richard.\" \" Let me lie heavy on thy soul to-morrow ! \" was the quotation that rose to my mind as I shared it out ; and, indeed, Avhen I had manfully eaten a slice of it from sense of duty, such virtue of setting a good example was rewarded by a bilious indigestion that went far to darken my scholastic prospects. But the boys seemed to enjoy this tough, heavy stuff, a piece de resistance from which their sound jaws and unpampered stomachs snatched a fearful joy, though Walker, I noticed, picked out a rather large lump of D"], [62, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 50 undisguised suet, which he was exhibiting to the derision of the rest. \"What have you got there?\" I asked in a suppressed tone of rebuke, fearful to draAv the notice of Mrs Spick, and have her accuse us all of \" vulgarity.\" \"The Koh-i-noor, sir, I think it must be,\" ansAvered the saucy wag, with that air of taking me into his jokes which I rather objected to as unbecoming the dignity of a Vice-Principal. All, except myself, having had their share of the banquet, the boys adjourned to the playground, while Mrs Spick remained behind in consultation Avith her staff. I seized the occasion to gain my liberty. This was Saturday afternoon, a half holiday; and I did not care to inquire too curiously whether any extraneous duties were required of me, but slunk out of the front door and took my way into the town. I felt as if I must have a breath of fresh air after the morning's depressing experiences. No daring truant ever more Avillingly turned his back on school life. And yet there was little even of the anxious glee of truancy in that half-stolen ramble. Boys, as they run from their troubles, do not always look behind ; but man, we know, looks before and after, and I was ahvays a susceptible creature, apt for fortune to play what tune she pleased on. With the fresh sea breeze for my only guide, leaving the dismal unfledged suburb, I wandered almost at random into the livelier parts of Brighton, then after a time came out upon the"], [63, "The Vice- Principal. 51 sea front, crowded Avith carriages and promenaders. The season here was at its height, but I found myself in no mood to enter into the spirit of the place. \" Kind, cheerful, merry Dr Brighton,\" as Thackeray has it, could not minister to my disease ; rather Avas I in a Paul Dombeyish mood, and Avhat the wild Avaves said to me was \u2014 how am I to get out of this wretched school ? It was a bright, blowy afternoon, as, silent and sad, I went by the shore of the much sounding ocean, and hardly knew whither to turn my irresolute steps. I strolled out along the pier, Avhere the band Avas playing, but never did I feel less merry to hear sweet music. I rambled on past a dreary succession of terraces and crescents, as far as the cliffs leading towards Rottingdean. I turned aside into the fields, thinking to shake off my troubles by the exertion of a sturdy tramp. But the country Avas sticky, soaked, and uninteresting ; and after loading my boots with mud, I turned back to the road Avith a heart heavier than ever. Once more I came sauntering along the pro menade, and mingled in the throng of pleasure seekers, at Avhose sociability I caught myself scowling like a Timon of Athens or an involuntary Manfred. Not one face did I know among all that mob of friends and acquaintances. I, only I, seemed to be walking alone. How could I hope to make any friend Avorth having in Brighton, so long as I remained the mock Vice- Principal of a quack college ? Never before had I realised"], [64, "A Sclwolmaster's Stories. 52 what it was to feel a pariah among one's fellows. At length, I did see a known face. Mardon and Pereira were strutting along arm in arm, with their best clothes on, apparently, and short pipes stuck in their mouths. Another minute and we should meet on the pavement, then I supposed it my duty as Vice-Principal to call them to account for smoking so shamelessly. But I had not the heart to encounter them. Trusting they Avould not have seen me, I bolted into the nearest shop, which happened to be the famous Mutton's. I remembered a schoolboy attempt of my own at smoking, and how, hardly Avith less alarm, I had shirked out of the way of a master. As excuse for taking refuge here, and to pass the time, I indulged myself in a slight refection at Mutton's, which, indeed, came in not unwelcome after the poor dinner I had made. Darkness was drawing on as I turned my slow footsteps toAvards Dr Spick's. A chilling, blinding rain blew in my face, making me ask savagely Avhat people meant by speaking as if Brighton enjoyed perpetual summer. Not that I minded this change in the weather \u2014 \" Welcome, kindred glooms ! \" I simply felt tired and cross. Then I lost my way, trudging through unfamiliar streets, and it was some time after nightfall before I hit upon the half-made road where my hateful home stood forlorn in the flickering light of a broken gas lamp opposite. The door Avas opened by poor Ditcherly, holding her hand across her mouth to keep out the night"], [65, "The Vice-Principal. 53 air. As I stood Aviping my boots on the mat, out popped Mrs Spick upon me, and forth- Avith began to take me to task before the maid, in a querulous tone that seemed more natural to her than those simpers of gentility. \"Why, sir, wherever have you been all this time ? \" I murmured something about taking a Avalk, and losing my way. \" But this is no time for taking walks. The Vice-Principal must be Avith the boys always, especially on a half-holiday. This is the day when Carthage dormitory has its weekly bath, which you are expected to see to; please remember that for the future. The juniors never will use soap, unless you stand over them. And, in the absence of the Principal, it is your duty to preside at the tea-table. Pray excuse my mentioning it ; but, of course, you have had no experience.\" Her voice rang so sharply that, now, I could well understand how the Doctor stood in awe of her. Accepting the rebuke with meekness, as became one whose duty was to look after the ablutions of small boys, I turned away, and, not knowing where else to seek refuge, betook myself to the \"hall,\" where I found all the boys except Mardon, who appeared to be treating himself to a half-holiday. Pereira, however, had come home, and was seated beside the smoky fire upon one of the only two chairs to be seen in the room, with his legs cocked over the other. At my appearance,"], [66, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 54 he did not move, nor did any of the others, lolling upon a form before the fireplace, offer to make room for me. \" I hope I don't intrude,\" was what my looks should have said, for I was only too conscious of playing Paul Pry, as I approached this chatter ing group, that at once made me the cynosure of their eyes. \" Been out seeing the beauties of Brighton ? \" asked Master Pereira in an off-hand tone, some thing between familiarity and patronage. He was looking me all over as if to judge how far he might venture to go in impertinence. Finally he took his legs off the chair, and kicked it over to me; but made up for this concession by beginning to whistle, by way of showing that I must not expect him to mind me much. I sat down meekly, only Avishing I could let these boys know how it was by no will of my own I thus became an invader upon their privacy. It was as if a tame wolf made his bow in a circle of sociable lambs. My arrival threw a significant silence on the party, Avhom, outside the door, I had heard talking and laughing loudly enough. I tried to break the awkward pause by remarking, in a tone of forced joviality, \u2014 \" Is nobody going to say anything ? \" Nobody spoke, one or two faintly smiled in recognition that I was pleased to be facetious ; then I overheard Pereira whispering to his neigh bour, \u2014 \"Why doesn't he say something himself?\""], [67, "The Vice- Principal. 55 \" Come ! \" I said, making a great effort at friendliness. \" I don't Avish to play the bogey. In your play hours you must not mind me. But, are there no lessons to be done in the evening ? \" \" Oh, sir ! \" cried Pereira. \" You are not going to make us do lessons on a half-holiday ? \" I Avas not prepared for this way of putting it, and, though I suspected he meant to deceive rne as to the routine of the establishment, since my Principal had given me no positive instructions, I did not press the matter, evidently to the relief of these urchins. \" You didn't come to see us playing hockey this afternoon, sir,\" said Walker, not the boy to sit silent long. \" The masters always look after us Avhen we are playing.\" \" There aren't so many masters in this school, are there ? \" remarked I, for something to say. \" Ah ! but Ave get a new one every three months, don't Ave ? \" Walker appealed to the rest, who recognised with a broad grin the transitoriness of Vice-Principalship at Dr Spick's. \"We all thought you had run away, sir,\" went on this saucy youth. \" I am sure I should run away the first day, if I were a master, and had to teach Skinny things. Did you ever see such a dunce, sir ? \" \"You're another,\" retorted the slow-witted Skinny, after a little consideration, whereupon Walker poked him in the ribs, and they began to shove each other in a good-natured way, till"], [68, "56 A Schoolmaster's Stories. both of them fell off the form, wrestling together, with bursts of laughter, on the dusty floor. This little disturbance broke the ice. Some of the boys took to chasing one another about, then to playing leap-frog round the room, without letting me be any further restraint upon them. A loud buzz of conversation burst forth, rising some times into shrieks, whoops, and cackling laughs, of Avhich I trusted I was not the object. Pereira, who had the warmest seat by the fire, stuck his feet in the fender, and took to reading a novel, Avith his back turned to me. The rest transformed into heat the various modes of motion in Avhich they worked off their superfluous energies, giving themselves up to jest and youthful jollity, while \" The Usher sat apart from all, A melancholy man.\" To keep myself in countenance, I took up a book which had been left lying on one of the forms, and made a show of reading. It was Sandford and Merton, not an inspiriting work for one who found it so hard to play Mr Barlow. My reading was, moreover, made uneasy by peas that came rattling near my head two or three times. Three or four idlers were spouting them at each other, and I seemed to be dangerously near the line of fire, till one hit Pereira's book, whereupon he looked round with a groAvl and silenced that artillery. I fancied the shots must have been sent my way on purpose ; but this was probably a mistake of mine. I think the boys"], [69, "The Vice-Principal. 57 were rather sorry for me, on the Avhole. One at least of them even took pity on my forlorn plight, for, after a time, young Downes, the boy I had set off crying at morning school, drew near and blushingly offered me a double apple, hard and green, as if in token of reconcilement. I took it thankfully, and eat it bravely : and that sour apple seemed as sweet refreshment to me, as Avas the blessed rain from heaven to the Ancient Mariner. Then another little fellow stole up to show me his collection of stamps; and yet a third, encouraged by my gracious reception of these, ventured to ask if it were true that I came from London, confiding to me that he was a Cockney, and hoAV he pined for the lost joys of Haverstock Hill. I Avas winning my way in this juvenile society. Even the players at leap-frog, whose game had by this time sublim ated itself into a more elevated and complicated form of vaulting ambition known as \" High cock alorum jig,\" a fierce quarrel of ritual having arisen over this pastime, broke away to refer the important question to me, whether the word jig behoved to be repeated three or four times after the mysterious formula, High Cockalorum ; and they seemed sur prised, trustful souls, at a confession that they had overestimated the extent of my knoAvledge. The great Pereira himself, after a time, laid down his book, and yawned in my face, as an apparent preliminary to opening a conversation. I rejoiced to see a chance of persuading this urchinry that I had no desire to play the spy or oppressor among them."], [70, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 58 But just as the fun was at its height, an inter ruption took place, such as forms the catastrophe of the fable of the town mouse and the country mouse. The door opened, and framed in the doorway stood the dumpy form of Mrs Spick, dressed in bonnet and shawl, an umbrella clasped in her arms, amazement, wrath, and reprobation depicted on her face. As if a Gorgon's head turned them to stone, at the sight of her, the rollicking boys at once fell still and silent, whereby I perceived that these revels must be unlawful or untimely, to which I had lent my countenance. One moment she stood in speechless eloquence, raising her eyes, as if to call heaven to witness such things were ; then she took three waddling steps into the room, and thus delivered herself in a tone of breathless indigna tion, that might have befitted a sentence to penal servitude : \" Boys ! what do I see ? You take advantage of your Principal's absence to neglect Preparation ! What will Dr Spick say ? I blush for you. You should blush for yourselves ! \" Some of the idlers were looking sheepish enough ; and, by way of excuse, they could only steal sidelong looks at me, as if to say that it was all my fault. Mrs Spick hardly vouchsafed me one glance of scorn, and did not hesitate to take the impaired discipline of the establishment out of my weak hands.

Every one of you ! \" Even as the roisterous stragglers of a pack of hounds lower their tails before the huntsman's rate, and are recalled to the path of duty at the crack of his Avhip, so these boys owned her mistressfulness. They slunk out in single file under the dame's angry eye, before which Pereira himself quailed for the nonce. No sooner were their retreating steps heard clattering up the stairs, than she turned her displeasure upon me. \" And their boots not changed yet. Oh, sir ! This is not a school of ploughboys.\" I stammered my apologies, pleading ignorance, want of orders, \"something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose,\" which the mistress received coldly, and gave me command, \" You must be good enough to see them all safe in bed after a quarter of an hour, and take away their candles, as I granted the Captain of the School permission to be out till ten. I myself have some business in town.\" With this she turned out all the gas lights but one, before withdraAving to leave me alone, her spoken and implied rebukes ringing in my ears Avith some suggestion of a verse from Milton, \" Back to thy punishment, false fugitive ! \" Annoyed with her, annoyed with myself, annoyed with the boys who had tricked me out of a lesson hour, I could find no pleasure in Sandford and Merton, but chucked it to the other end of the room, and sat savagely poking the feeble fire to"], [72, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 60 work off on it my vexation against the fate of a schoolmaster, \"downbent, broken-hearted, under foot martyr,\" as Carlyle, I now perceived, so well calls him. It seemed that the lady meant me to go to bed also, for, as an apparent hint to this effect, Ditcherly presently brought in a small plate of bread and cheese, and a glass of beer on a tray, with the message that Missis had gone out, that Master Avasn't come home, and she had to sort the washing, and would I please have my supper now. The poor girl's face was swollen like a turnip by this time, so that she could hardly speak. I said a few words of sympathy, and she mumbled out that she thought of going to the dentist the day after to-morrow, then went off to sort the Avash ing like one who had no time to waste in idle complaints. The stoicism of this fellow-sufferer on the scholastic treadmill was a reproof to me. When she went about her duties so bravely though in such evident pain, could not I, too, suffer and be strong till at least the day after to-morrow ? Having swallowed a few mouthfuls of the scanty meal, I girded up my loins to go about that task of seeing those troublesome imps tucked up for the night. I could have wished, indeed, that my Dogberry had given me a straiter charge, for if found frolicsome, I hardly kneAv how I might overawe the rioters as effectually as their mistress, \u2022I, who would not hang a dog by my will. As I approached the first dormitory, that Avhich"], [73, "The Vice- Principal. 61 it was Dr Spick's humour to call \" Rome,\" I became aAvare of a scandalous disturbance within, shrieks of half-choked laughter, sounds of thump ing and jumping, and the pattering of bare feet, clearly to be suppressed by virtue of my office. Now or never must I shoAV myself worth my salt as a Vice-Principal. Hesitating no longer than in an attempt to steel my features to the awfulness of Mrs Spick's, I prepared to enter like the ghost in Hamlet, and suddenly flung open the door, but started back as a wet sponge caught me full in the face, blinding me for the moment, and bedabbling my shirt front. One incontinent cackle hailed this discomfiture, then fell a hush of dismay and utter silence. As soon as I could wipe my eyes, I darted back into the room, now to find all there \" As peaceful and as still As the mist slumbering on yon hill.\" The wave of Roderick Dhu's hand had not brought about a more speedy vanishing of each warrior where he stood. The roisterers had bolted into bed, all but one or two Avho judged better to finish undressing in sheltered corners. While they were hurriedly disrobing, I looked about for some representative official in Dr Spick's hierarchy, to whom I could fitly communicate my displeasure. I caught sight of Wilks Major's curly head half buried under his pillow, and to him I addressed myself. \" Wilks, sit up, and listen to me.\" He showed no readiness to obey, and a stifled"], [74, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 62 titter ran round the room, which swelled to an outburst, when, at my repeated command, he reluctantly raised himself and revealed good reason for lying low, \u2014 \" Behold ! his bosom and half his side!\" \u2014 in short, taken by surprise, the Prefect of Hall had evidently scurried into bed Avith nothing on. \" It Avas an accident, sir,\" he faltered forth. \" We didn't mean to hit you. I Avas throwing it at Walker.\" \" Indeed, indeed, sir, that's how it was,\" corro borated the latter, keeping himself carefully out of sight in, no doubt, a similar state of nakedness. \" We were only having a little fun.

So ! Now that I was thoroughly roused, I felt there would be some satisfaction in letting that spoilt half-caste have a bit of my mind. I strode up to the bed, in which nothing of its occupant Avas to be seen but a vague outline of his form beneath the counterpane, and thus began my homily after the best manner of one of my own old schoolmasters, before Avhose slightest rebuke Ave used to shake in our shoes."], [75, "The Vice-Principal. 63 \" Pereira, you have been placed in a position of responsible authority over your schoolfellows, and of this trust you show yourself disgracefully unfit.

What can Ave say of a Prefect who makes himself accomplice in the tricks of foolish small boys, far less to be blamed than he who so \u2014 so \u2014 so cowardly neglects his duty ? \" To these rhetorical questions Master Pereira returned not the slightest answer.

So far as I could judge, the boys were struggling between a certain respect for my displeasure and an over powering itch of the ludicrous, the cause for which remained hidden from me. They buried their heads beneath the bedclothes to stuff down their amusement ; more than one couch was visibly shaking from the same effort ; and I saw how Walker's body Avrithed, as in torment, under the counterpane. What had I said to laugh at, when"], [76, "64 A Schoolmaster's Stories. terror and dismay were rather called for? At length, on my once more solemnly adjuring Pereira to unfold himself, under penalty of a long imposition, it was Walker who first burst forth into an agony of muffled laughter ; then the rest broke loose ; and the Avhole room rang Avith irrepressible guffaws, even as Avhen Vulcan, trying to emulate the graces of Hebe, roused the mirth of high Olympus. Irritated out of self-possession, I seized Pereira 's blankets and tore them aAvay from the false slumberer. And what did I see beneath ? Nothing but a bolster artfully arranged to deceive, as Michal deceived Saul. He who should have slept here was gone, doubtless on no good errand, and it was a deaf image I had been so vehemently apostrophising. \" Very well, I shall speak to Dr Spick about this,\" quoth I ; and that threat was effectual in throwing a chill to the heart of the boys' merri ment; though still, as I walked glumly out, leaving them to sobered reflections, a dropping chuckle here and there testified to the excitement of the comedy just enacted before them. I now betook myself to \" Carthage,\" where I found all quiet as if Marius were sitting among its ruins. Perhaps, indeed, they had taken Avarning from their comrades' peril, to judge by the suspiciously demonstrative snores that attended my removal of their candle. Now I heard Dr Spick's voice down stairs, and hailed his arrival as gladly as Wellington did Blucher's at Waterloo. I went straight doAvn to"], [77, "The Vice-Principal. 65 make my report, to which he listened without show ing the pedagogic wrath to be expected, though I confessed how I had let preparation slip, and de nounced the tumult in the dormitory, and wound up Avith the crowning scandal of Pereira being out on the loose. The Principal seemed tired and dispirited. \" I have been to Lewes on business \u2014 pecuniary business,\" he had explained; and now he said, with an effort at polite interest in my tale of lawlessness, \" I am sorry the boys have given you so much trouble. I will deal Avith them severely to-morrow, or rather on Monday morning, for in matters of discipline Sunday is always Avith us a dies nefas.\" I think he was making a shot at dies nou.

There I spent a Avretched night, haunted by night mare bodings that in the dark swell up to such a size, and kept awake by stifled groans from an adjacent room, in Avhich I guessed that poor Ditcherly must be wrestling Avith her lonely agonies.

He himself took a good deal of pains in playing the paternal among them, so that I had example not to shirk that part of my office. He asked me if I had any objection to going to chapel, which I took to be a term of his scholastic bounce, but found he meant a real conventicle. \" I and Mrs Spick accompany the church boys; and the Vice-Principal usually superintends the non-conformist division.\" \" Of course somebody must go with the chapel lot,\" added Mrs S., as if a Vice-Principal's de votions Avere a cheap matter. \" For my part, I don't understand how respectable families can allow their sons to be brought up in these vulgar forms of religion; and I have always noticed that the dissenting boys tear and dirty their clothes much faster than the others.\" So, after an hour spent in hearing catechisms and such-like, at church time I betook myself Avith softie four or five boys, duly endimanches, to a brick tabernacle not far off, Avhere we sat through a very skimpy service, and a very long sermon containing certain propositions, dubitable"], [79, "The Vice- Principal. 67 and indubitable, that might have been reasonably stated, argued, and illustrated in five minutes. I am not intolerant, but I confess myself to have been little edified under \u2014 \" The pig-of-lead-like pressure Of the preaching man's immense stupidity.\" Perhaps I did him an injustice, for I sat no very attentive hearer, too much distracted by putting it to myself, like Lancelot Gobbo, Avhether my conscience Avould serve me to run from the quack, my master. Nor, I think, did the boys receive much benefit, though they got a little unexpected diversion in the accident of the worthy orator Avaxing so vehement over shouting out the same thing again and again, that he knocked down a glass of water on his pulpit cushion, which struck my charges with such comic force, it Avas all I could do to frown them back into decorousness. The only other incident of that morning was my overhearing a conversation, wherefrom I learned how I had already acquired the nickname of Span, Avhich, indeed, I suspect, must have been a title of office, like C\u00e6sar or Pharaoh, generically applied, by schoolboy wit, to all Dr Spick's assistants, short-reigned race as they Avere like to be. At dinner, Mrs Spick appeared in a Avonderful array of frills and flounces, more disposed to jig, amble, and lisp than ever; and, as if a Sabbath spirit softened her towards my shortcomings, sent"], [80, "68 A Schoolmasters Stories. elaborately artificial smiles to where I sat, at the bottom of the board, conscientiously dividing the Yorkshire pudding upon lines already marked out for my guidance. The Doctor himself, much taken up by his duties as carver, seemed unusually subdued, which I put down to the absence of his favourite exercise of hearing himself talk. Like Crabbe's schoolmaster \u2014 \" Half the ease and comfort he enjoys, Is when surrounded by slates, books, and boys, But, as I was soon to know, the poor man had good reasons for being out of spirits. After dinner, he very civilly invited me to \" wine \" in the parlour. \" On Sundays, we make a practice of seeing one or two of the boys in a sociable manner,\" he said ; and Mrs Spick struck in Avith \u2014 \" But I was obliged to find serious fault Avith the boys last night, so, to-day, I have asked no one but Pereira.\" Her husband stole a guilty look at me ; and I perceived that he had not thought fit to com municate to the good lady my charge against that young gentleman, who presently joined us, as cool as if he were unconscious of any over hanging accusation, though I noticed in him a peculiar cat-like observation of me, Avhich seemed to be silently inquiring whether I had reported his delinquency. Putting a good face on his presence, Dr Spick poured out a glass of ginger-wine for his guests,"], [81, "The Vice-Principal. 69 and a half one for himself, the bottle being at an end ; then we each took a gingerbread biscuit, and munched the sweetness of dissipation in loco. But any convivial sense on my part was marred by the stealthy stares of Pereira. I wish this tawny youngster could have sat for his portrait to Mr Rudyard Kipling. I find myself unable to depict that sallow, pimply, unwholesome face, with its mingled expression of sneering and fawning. I misliked him not so much for his complexion, as because I knew him to be an artful rogue, obsequious or insolent as it might appear Avorth Avhile. Yet, if imitation be the sincerest flattery, I ought to have been conciliated by the sharp, sly eyes, which were critically fixed on every detail of my appearance. At breakfast, Master Pereira had Avorn his necktie in a bow, but, since seeing mine, Avhich happened to be tied in a sailor's knot, he had altered accordingly the fashion of his. Here Avas a reminiscence of Toots and Mr Feeder, B.A. If only Dickens could have known how often, during my ordeal in that school, I tickled myself out of depression by recalling parallel instances from his works ! There Ave sat, genteelly carousing in sips, like that celebrated silent party in a parlour ; but conversation languished among us, even though the Principal tried to start it by offering a proof of wisdom no less profound than that of the scholar who established how Athenian boys cried when they were whipped. \" I have been all my life a careful observer of"], [82, "70 A Schoolmaster s Stories. the Aveather, and I have noticed that at this season it is apt to be changeable.\" \" You should write to the papers about it, sir,\" suggested the flattering Pereira, Avith that che-che accent which puzzled me, unaccustomed as yet to meet natives of the East. When this subject fizzled out like a damp squib, Mrs Spick went to her jingling piano and played some hymn tunes, badly enough, as even my unmusical ears could detect ; but Pereira sat apparently drinking in the sounds, his eyes fixed on her, a statue of rapt devotion. This shoAV of admiration seemed to tickle the lady, who, as she Avent on strumming with much self-satisfaction, could not see what I saw, how her young connois seur more than once put up his hand to hide a hideous yawn. I was ready to go to sleep myself, though the Principal sought to keep me awake by expounding a scheme of his' for the abolition of dissent, which, however, proved less anti-soporific than those false notes Avhich the performer slipped out now and then. Much as Mrs Spick seemed to \"fancy herself \" as a musician, this did not prevent her from attending to business, and presently she stopped to give a broad hint aimed at me. \"Is it not time the boys were going out for their promenade ? \" \" Ah, yes ! \" assented her husband, and explained to me delicately, \"We send them out on fine Sunday afternoons, accompanied by the Vice- Principal, Avhose authority may be useful in"], [83, "The Vice-Principal. 71 backing-up that of the Prefects. Brighton is not a town where boys can be trusted alone.\" \" You will, please, see that the little boys arc tidy, and don't let them get off the pavement,\" commanded the lady, going on to instruct me further as to my duties. \" When you come home, you must sit with them till tea-time, and take care they don't read any books that are not fit for Sunday. We had a Vice-Principal last year, who set the very worst example. He used to read a book called Dant, all about most improper subjects that should not be men tioned except by clergymen. Luckily it was written in Italian, so it could not do so much harm.\" I hardly restrained a smile at her insular estimate of Italian souls as being of no great consequence, and I could not help noticing that with all the good lady's horror of un-sabbatical literature, she now took up a magazine with fashion plates for its chief attraction. But she had still another charge to give me. \" Then, there's the letters home, which have to be written on Sunday evening, and the Vice- Principal should rule lines for the younger boys, and read them over when they are done.\" \" Read their letters ? \" \" Of course. For the credit of the establishment, it is well to see they Avrite no nonsense, besides spelling properly.\" \" I am afraid I can't undertake to read boys' private letters,\" said I, putting my foot down for"], [84, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 72 the first time. \" I never Avas at any school Avhere such things Avere done.\" \" Only as a precaution against crudeness of expression \u2014 standing as Ave do in loco parento,\" Dr Spick said, nervously; but his consort snorted for scorn of my scruples. Looking out of the window, with her eye bent on vacancy, she uttered a speech of Avhat Avas meant to be freezing rebuke. \" I name no names \u2014 I make no allusions \u2014 I don't hold Avith being personal \u2014 ahem ! \u2014 but it seems to me that some people have no call to think themselves too big for their business.\" At this sufficiently pointed sarcasm, the Prin cipal softly ejaculated \" My dear ! \" but that Pereira grinned like an ill-conditioned ape, and I turned very red under his evident delight to see me snubbed. Since it behoved me, as it did Sir Gareth of old, to suffer a lady in all her moods, without a word I walked out of the room, followed by Dr Spick, who seemed distressed on my account, and strove to make up for his wife's rudeness by extra civility. \" These little details of scholastic life are no doubt repugnant to a man of your education, but you Avill soon come to look on them as matters of course,\" he insinuated, with a thin, hard laugh, which was his best attempt at geniality. Here was the chance to pick a quarrel with my Vice-Principalship ! If these details be matters of course \u2014 \" Let me be no assistant to a school, But keep a farm and carters ! \""], [85, "The Vice-Principal. 73 That was what I thought, but I said nothing, hesitating to make his Avife's conduct a casus belli. Before I could bring myself to speak out my mind, we were among the boys, ready and apparently eager to set out on their walk. I had really been most willing to go with them, no longer so much afraid of this crew, and welcoming any change from the dulness of the parlour; but now I was a little taken aback to find that we were to march in a formal procession, two and two, like the beasts of a Noah's Ark, I, in the part of Shem or Ham, bringing up the rear \u2014 ''the custom of all the best schools in Brighton,\" Dr Spick assured me. In this array we set out promenading ourselves through the streets, which seemed to be a treat for the boys more than for their pedagogue. They could talk and laugh with their cronies ; I had my dignity to keep up, ill-coupled in fellow ship with the \" Captain of the school,\" Avhom, for all his Avhiskers, I found such a sulky or a stupid lout that I could hardly get a word out of him ; but I was as Avell pleased to be left to the company of my own thoughts. Once Ave met a girls' school, to whom of course we gave the wall, and I was fain to fix my eyes on the ground as we passed along their tittering ranks. Again we encountered another school of boys marching in like order. They and my flock showed a disposition, restrained chiefly by the consciousness of being in their Sunday clothes, to hustle one another off the pavement. As we"], [86, "A Schoolmasters Stories. 74 cleared each other, I stole a look at their \" Vice- Principal,\" hoping to catch some glance of sympathetic brotherhood, but he rather surveyed me critically, as if my appearance betrayed my rawness in the scholastic army. Yesterday, walking out by myself, I had been sad to see no familiar face. To-day, my concern Avas the fear of meeting anyone I knew, and being seen at the tail of such a string. Why this false shame ? I asked of conscience and of reason. Your man of the world Avould not mind gambling, cursing, or doing in public many another act with no more relish of salvation in it, yet would shrink from the open disgrace of playing guardian to a pack of tender youth. Should I let myself be a slave to conventional ideas of the becoming, when a hundred gentlemen in Brighton were perhaps less praiseworthily occupied that afternoon, yet not afraid to be seen by their friends ? But so it is \u2014 alas, that it is so ! I had to admit to myself how, like the mass of my kind, I was still far from that highest moral state \"in Avhich the supreme and most powerful sentiments are those called forth by contemplation of conduct itself, and not by contemplation of other persons' opinions of conduct.\" Herbert Spencer's philosophy could not comfort me, nor did I take heart to think hoAv I might do my little part in the evolution of the moral sentiments that is to bring human nature into complete fitness for the social state. I loathed the state of being usher to a sham Socrates and a foolish Xantippe; and all my thoughts kept running"], [87, "The Vice-Principal. 75 on one question \u2014 how might I find an excuse to throw up my post without hurting anyone's feelings or my OAvn honour? Out on the vanity of human Avishes ! I had judged it a great thing to get a post as under-master, \u2014 sed revocare gradum ! To spare my self-consciousness, I would will ingly have made the boys sneak through back streets, but, not knowing the way, had to let them take the lead, and they dragged me behind them, downcast as the chained victim of a triumph, through all the best parts of Brighton. I tried to rouse myself to a stern satisfaction in this ordeal, \" Let me taste the whole of it, fare like my peers ! \" But I Avas much relieved to get home again, without meeting anyone I knew, and with no more unpleasant incident than the vivacious Walker pushing his yoke fellow into a gutter, for Avhich I felt bound to order him a week's \" gating.\" Already I found the judicial sternness of a Vice-Principal becoming a property of more easiness to me. At tea, Mrs Spick preserved towards me a manner of frozen hauteur, and emphasised her displeasure by being particularly gracious to Pereira, Avhich did not prevent him from filching tAvo or three lumps of sugar off the table, as soon as her back was turned. Afterwards, I expected Ave should once more attend public Avorship ; but Avhat Dr Spick called \" Evening Chapel,\" turned out this time to be a domestic function held in the schoolroom. He himself officiated, arrayed in a surplice to read the church prayers, I"], [88, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 76 modestly declining any part in the function ; Mardon and Pereira, as prefects, stumbled through the lessons, and Mrs Spick, with her best bonnet on for this occasion, led the musical efforts of the little congregation on a creaky harmonium. Then the Principal gave us a sermon of his own, extempore of course, as to Avhich I could only say to myself, \" Why, this is a more excellent song than the other ! \" I don't think I eA-er sat through such an intolerable deal of Avords to so poor a pennyworth of matter. Yet this lay preacher appeared to have a flux of good intentions, for the sake of which I strove to stifle criticism. He had at least one appreciative hearer in his wife, whom I saw actually shedding tears at a piece of fustian sentiment worked up into the peroration. One knew not Avhat these idle tears could mean, unless that she really believed in her glib-tongued spouse, albeit she ruled over him rather as a mother than a wife. After \"chapel,\", Mrs Spick, vanishing for a moment, returned with a basket on her arm. I thought of brimstone and treacle; but what she proceeded to serve out all round was a sheet of paper and an envelope, gaudily embossed with the \"college arms,\" a device in which a griffin rampant rose above a scroll bearing the incon gruous motto, Knowledge is Power, surrounded by the grandest name of the institution, Avhereto was added this legend, \"Terms on Application.\" Before leaving the room, she announced, Avith a significant glance at me, that no letter was to be"], [89, "The Vice-Principal. 77 posted till it had been submitted to her censorship. Then all the boys industriously set about that Sunday exercise, Avhich I resigned myself to superintend. The occupation, the spirit of the day, and thoughts of home could not fail to soften their manners for the nonce, nor suffered them to be so rough, and in this mood I found it easier to get on Avith them. It was a relief not to be looked on as a harsh task-master; then all my latent paternal feelings went out towards those urchins Avho so confidently sought my advice on questions of spelling or the dissembling of blots. Some of them even consulted me as to what they ought to say, and Walker opened a Aveak spot in his heart, telling me about the little sister at home, for whose benefit he was making a collection of riddles ; he asked me for a con tribution, but the plea of its being Sunday served to excuse my lack of ready wit. My bete noire, Pereira, was kept quiet by his evident difficulty in Avrestling with the duty of literary composition. Those Avho had more readily accomplished their epistles, fell into a subdued buzz of conversation, with which Mrs Spick herself could have found no fault. In short, for half an hour or so, we all got on Avell together ; and, for the moment, I felt a Vice-Principal's lot not so intolerable. I had left my desk, and Avas sitting in an ill lighted corner of the room beside Downes, who after giggling a great deal over a row of crosses, with Avhich he had the idea of beginning his"], [90, "78 A Schoolmaster's Stories. letter, and explained to me that they stood for kisses, now looked ready to cry because I told him there were not two Us in holidays. I was helping this little fellow, I say, to express his filial affection, when the door opened and in walked the boy I have called Skinny, \u2014 whose real name Avas Smith. He had been out upon what our Principal termed an Exit, spending the day with an aunt, grandmother, or Avhat not. Now, casting a look at my empty desk, he exclaimed, \u2014 \" Hallo ! Have you kicked out old Span ? \" It was my nickname I heard spoken in this off hand fashion. I might Avell start, and the boys look up with a chuckle that should have enlightened the unfortunate Smith ; but his attention was taken up Avith tugging at something in his pocket ; and he went on, unconscious of my presence. \" Here's your cigars, Pereira ; but the man says you must send the money next time, or \" The general grin had enlightened him, and his eyes following all the others to that corner where I sat, he suddenly pulled himself up as short as Harpagon caught talking of his buried treasure, and ended, half laughing, half-shamed, with a mumbling apology \u2014 \" didn't know \u2014 didn't mean \u2014 didn't see you, sir.\" \"Never mind, but Avhat have you got there?\" said I, coming forward to meet him. Attention was now transferred to Pereira, who started up with a very naughty word on his lips. Mardon gave a great horse-laugh at the discom fiture of his crony: and Walker, rubbing his hands in keen enjoyment of the humorous side of the"], [91, "The Vice-Principal. 79 situation, uttered a schoolboy phrase once not unknown to me \u2014 \" Fair lick ! \" I took the cigars from the messenger's unwilling hands, and flung them into the middle of the fire. Then, as resolutely as if the spirit of a Keate or an Udall were incarnated in me, I turned upon Pereira with \u2014 \" Does Mrs Spick allow you to send the younger boys on such errands ? \" \" That's no business of yours,\" snarled he, nettled by the sarcasm, which was not thrown away upon the intent audience. \" Very good. It is my business to ask Dr Spick's opinion,\" quoth I, witheringly, and stalked out of the room. This incident had come in the nick of time to Avhet my almost blunted purpose. I Avould seek \u2022out the Principal forthwith to denounce that unwholesome half-caste, and Avould work myself over it into the mood for resigning my charge as deputy shepherd of such a flock. Though ordi narily I am pigeon-livered enough as to giving offence, I do not lack gall when roused ; and for the moment I felt capable of being round Avith my Brummagem Busby. I found him alone in his sanctum, reading what looked suspiciously like a yellow-back novel, which he tried to shuffle out of sight at my appearance, and hastened to anticipate any censorious judgment. \" On Sunday evenings I usually indulge in a little light reading to calm my mind. The bow of Cupid must not always be bent, as Virgil says."], [92, "80 A Schoolmaster's Stories. But I am glad to be interrupted, if I can be of any service to you.\" At once I laid before him my fresh accusation against Pereira, to which he listened with darkening countenance. \" That fellow is the plague of my life \u2014 I Avonder you did not box his ears ! \" he broke out, quite forgetting his own principles of public school government. \" He certainly seems to me to deserve some severe punishment.\" \" H'm,\" said the doctor, doubtfully. \" This is a peculiar case \u2014 a very sensitive boy \u2014 and one in whom my Avife feels a singular interest. Pray sit down. Yes \u2014 I will deal Avith him to-morrow; you may depend on my being firm. Perhaps you will not mention this little matter to Mrs Spick. She takes these things so much to heart.\" His nervous glance tOAvards the parlour, and the appeal ad misericordiam which he seemed to make, shook my stiffness 'a little, but I went on to say \u2014 \" If there is a boy I dislike and distrust in the school, it's him.\" \" It is he, you should rather say. Excuse me \u2014 a schoolmaster's habit of making corrections ! Then the constant practice of literary composition makes one attentive to grammatical niceties.\" I winced painfully to find myself corrected for a colloquialism by such a shallow pedant. Noav would I have paved the way to that other delicate business; but before I could recover from my"], [93, "The Vice- Principal. 81 confusion, Dr Spick had got his hand in, and was giving a new lead to the conversation. \" There is, indeed, much to try one's temper in a schoolmaster's life. That point I have handled at some length in the twenty-fifth chapter of my book \u2014 were you aAvare that I write for the press ? \" \" No,\" said I, dismayed to see him open a draAver, from which, of course, he drew forth his manuscripts. If he Avas going to talk about them, how could I introduce the subject Avhich had risen to my lips, Avhen that slip threw me out. I must humour him by listening for a little, and judiciously draw him back to the question of my own affairs. So I silently submitted to be bored. \" Yes,\" said the disclosed author, complacently. \" At odd moments I find relief from the cares of office in jotting down my thoughts as they occur. Mrs Spick, though she admires these literary efforts, complains that my mind is too active, but it is better to wear out than to rust. Your pre decessor, who Avrote an excellent hand, was good enough to copy several of my essays, Avhich I have submitted to the chief magazines and reviews.\" \" Have any of them appeared in print ? \" asked I, wondering if this were a hint to me of a new feature in my duties. I write a bad hand, a defect that now for once might do me yeoman's service. \" Well \u2014 no,\" confessed this pundit, rubbing his nose. \"There is so much jealousy and cliqueism in literary circles. Nothing goes down but vulgar flippancy and pretension. Editors have a dread of solid, thoughtful writing, unless spiced by a F"], [94, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 82 kind of meritricious ornament to which I cannot prostitute my pen. I am now, however, engaged upon a magnus opus that is likely to startle the educational world. I myself should prefer to remain a humble unknown teacher, but I think it every man's duty to lay before the public the results of his reflection and experience. The History and Theory of Education is the title I have chosen \u2014 suggested, indeed, by Mrs Spick, on whose literary judgment I place great reliance.\" The modest author Avas now fingering a small pile of close written copy-books ; and, little as I yet knew of this race, certain automatic instincts recorded in the consciousness of the species, gave me a guess Avhat would come next. \" If you are at leisure for a few minutes, perhaps you Avould like to hear the opening of my first section ? \" What could I say? I must only hope that the reading of his own composition might bring him into a good humour and lead up to some favourable time of speaking on my own matter. So I murmured assent, resignedly disposing myself to listen. The doctor cleared his throat, opened his manuscript, and began \u2014 \" Education,\" \u2014 but surely the intelligent reader need hardly be told how he began or how he went on. \" Education,\" he repeated, dwelling lovingly on the resounding syllables of his blessed Avord Mesopotamia, \" is at once the most important, the most Aveighty, and the most momentous subject that can engage the attention or the consideration"], [95, "The Vice-Principal. 83 of an intelligent, rational, and reflective human being.\" Thus on he went, sailing full before the wind of his own complete satisfaction, reeling out a string of wordy platitudes, which set me reflecting how one good of an university education is to teach you what other people know and what you yourself do not know. The poor man was not only dull in himself, but the cause of overpowering dulness in his hearer. For a few sentences, I tried to follow what he called his train of argument, then gave it up in despair, content to catch his eye from time to time when he glanced at me to emphasise some special truism, Avhile I all the Avhile was wondering whether he would exhaust himself before supper and give me the chance of coming to an explanation. I caught myself thinking of other things \u2014 of what a fool I had been to accept this post Avithout making fuller inquiries \u2014 of how much editors were to be pitied who had to wade through reams of such stuff \u2014 of how glad I should be to get to bed after a day of the powerful Brighton air \u2014 how much more glad to shake off the burden of Vice- Principalship, which a flash of sleepy fancy showed me laying down at the railway station and asking the porter to ticket myself for London ; then Dr Spick's monotonous voice became the rattle and drone of the train carrying me away for ever from this dismal quackery of a college, at which I seemed already to have spent years of anxious slavery, and now at length Avas I released, speeding to a lotus land where Mrs Spick would cease"], [96, "A Schoolmasters Stories. 84 from troubling, and the victims of her husband's eloquence be at rest. Suddenly I started up. Dr Spick, fallen silent, was regarding me Avith an astonished stare, as I rubbed my eyes. I had been fast asleep. Unable to look him in the face, when I realised my offence against authorial vanity, I could do nothing but snatch at excuses \u2014 I was tired \u2014 I had a headache \u2014 would he mind my going to bed ? More in sorrow than in anger, apparently, the Principal received my apologies, assuring me that he Avould see after the boys for the rest of the evening. After that, there was nothing for it but to slink to my room, like a naughty child, without any supper; and, this night, I did have a good sleep, yet not without some disturbing consideration of the question \u2014 how far it might beseem a Vice-Principal to run away from school. V. Next morning, I got up disgusted with my own Avant of will, that yet I lived to say, \" This thing's to do.\" And the sooner done, the better, lest I found myself giving in to craven scruples through the enervating force of custom. My resolution to resign Avas confirmed by a dispute I, in part, overheard going on at the side door between Ditcherly and the milkman, Avho loudly declared that not another pint would he deliver Avithout payment of his bill. I registered an"], [97, "The Vice-Principal, 85 inward vow that not another sun should go down before I had taken steps to sever all connection with this unsatisfactory establishment. Intently I watched the first opportunity of coming to a private explanation with my em ployer. But, as soon as breakfast was over, he summoned us all into the schoolroom to hold a grand bed of justice over Saturday night's doings. This function he discharged with apparent gusto, like a Cato only too ready to give his little senate laws. So loud Avere his denunciations of their trans gression, and so lengthy his threats of the punish ment about to be pronounced, that I felt quite sorry for having got the boys into such a scrape, half-minded, indeed, to intercede for them on the score of it being my \"first time.\" But, after all, the parturition of his mountainous reproaches turned out a case of ridiadus mus. He wound up by sentencing all the boarders to be \" gated \" for a week. The Prefects were, furthermore, for the same time deprived of their \" privileges,\" what ever these might be. I had already found out how Prefects were so numerous here in pro portion to their non-official fellows, as to suggest that famous army of \"four and twenty men and five and thirty pipers.\" But the occupants of the riotous dormitory came worst off, for they, in addition, were ordered an imposition of six hundred lines, Avhich sounded truly imposing, till the Principal explained that it was to be divided among their guilty hands in equal proportions."], [98, "86 A Schoolmaster's Stories. Dr Spick, whatever one might think of him, was no very cruel tyrant. When the common herd had thus been tried, condemned, and sentenced, a process which took nearly a quarter of an hour, girding his toga about him, as if for some high act of Roman severity, he bid Pereira follow him into the \" study.\" As Mrs Spick's favourite slouched off to this private inquisition, his school-fellows exchanged significant Avinks and nods, raising my curiosity, which, however, I thought it proper to repress. Not only did dignity forbid me to discuss Avith the boys their Head's administration of discipline, but I took it they would be in a high degree resentful for the hand I had had in bringing them under punishment. Yet no such feeling was manifest in Walker's manner, when, treating me rather as an accomplice than as an agent of the law, he remarked, with a gleeful Avriggle, that they had got off cheaper than he expected. \" I hope it will be a lesson to you,\" quoth I, magisterially; but I was so much relieved by this unlooked for friendliness, that I let myself fall into his confidential tone, and asked him if Pereira was going to be flogged. At this suggestion there was a smile. \" No such luck ! \" said Walker, a sentiment that seemed to meet with general approval. \" Mrs Spick wouldn't let him,\" grinned another. \" You see, sir, Pereira pays extra to be a fifth form fellow. And if they thrashed him he Avould hoAvl loud enough to bring down the house, and"], [99, "The Vice- Principal. 87 then write home about it. There are only four fellows in the school allowed to have corporal punishment. I am one of them \u2014 isn't it a shame ? My father told him,\" a jerk of Master Walker's thumb towards the study, \" that I required a firm hand. I call it beastly unfair. Did you ever see a boy so well-behaved as me, sir ? \" \" Shut up, you kids,\" growled Mardon, who sat like a bear with a sore head under a reproach the master had thrown out against him for being absent on Saturday night from his important post. Well enough pleased to have the saucy chatterer snubbed for me, I didn't admire the Captain of the School giving orders thus before my face ; but I thought it not worth Avhile to find fault, since some how or other my tenure of office was soon to be cut short. Yet how ? I had half hoped the Principal might forget himself so far as to launch some of his thunders at me, which would have been a Avelcome excuse for picking a quarrel. Pereira's ordeal was soon over. Presently Dr Spick brought him back into the schoolroom, looking like a Avhipped cur, and I noticed him scowl at Skinny with a threatening gesture. What could this mean ? I bethought me how that Smith with such an alias had been the involuntary agent in betraying his contraband goods ; and no doubt, if he durst, this half-caste would have mani fested his spite against me. But my attention was now taken off by the Principal, who, so far from blaming me, said most politely \u2014 \" I have long ago come to the conclusion that"], [100, "88 A Schoolmaster's Stories. firmness is the backbone of authority. After the example I have made I trust my boys will not again fail in respect for you. But \" \u2014 this spoken aloud for all the room to hear \u2014 \" if they should give you any further cause for complaint, let them remember that they have ME to deal with ! \" How was I ever to take occasion for falling out with such a self-satisfied and well-intentioned Squeers? One might as well attempt to twist the tail of a greased pig, or to swim against a stream of treacle. I myself am not one to find quarrel in a straw, and with dismay I foresaw that I might have to stay on till Christmas before any fair excuse offered itself for breaking my rash engagement. We noAv resumed our studies, as Dr Blimber would have said; Dr Spick called it \"going into second school,\" as if there had been any first school. To-day the boys seemed all in league to afford me no grievance. For an hour or so, indeed, I had only a few of the smallest ones to take in \" mathe matics,\" i.e., the multiplication table, while the Principal gave the rest a lecture on Avhat he termed \" Ethics and Moral Philosophy.\" But even when the \"classical side\" came to me for their Latin, they were respectful and attentive to a degree that enfeebled my purpose of deserting them. I had not ventured to sit down without looking for cobbler's Avax or some such snare on my seat of office; but nothing of the kind! Surely the schoolboys of this generation have groAvn milder and of less mischievous manners since the days when, as books tell us, they were in the Avay of"], [101, "The Vice-Principal. 89 playing those time-honoured tricks on their masters. I have now been a schoolmaster for a quarter of a century, with \u2014 so far as I can remember \u2014 but one solitary experience of any scandalous attempts on my dignity. Perhaps the improved dominie of our day has himself to thank if his pupils no longer delight to lay \" knives under his pillow and halters in his pew.\" At all events, my little band of pupils, duly sobered by their Jupiter's fulmination, were that morning in no mood to be frisky. I fancy these boys hardly yet knew Avhat to make of me, an usher of a kind somewhat out of their sphere, who actually had supines and subjunctives at his finger- ends, Avithout having to look for them in the book. And I, for my part, had hit upon an ingenious method of preserving discipline. I opened a register in Avhich I announced that I Avas going to keep a list of good and black marks against each name ; then I found the boys all agog to deserve a good mark or to escape a note of censure. It did not seem to occur to them that my good marks were a mere paper currency, while for the bad ones nobody would be one penny the worse. Such is human nature, which, even when grown up, makes as much of a few honorific letters after its name as of any reward in solid pudding. Possibly my notes Avould have soon been at a discount, when their real value appeared. But they served for an hour, after Avhich deliverance was at hand for me. This hint is to warn the reader of an approaching catastrophe. \" If you have tears, prepare to weep them now.\""], [102, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 90 Once that I had settled I was not meant to be a teacher, I found teaching come more easy to me. Dr Spick left me entirely to myself; and I might have been instructing the class in Chinese meta physics Avithout his being much the wiser. The boys seemed interested in my efforts to bring home to them that Latin was no mechanical contrivance for their affliction, but a language like their own, in which youngsters once Avere merry and sad, and asked for apples and swopped playthings, besides building walls and shutting the gates of cities ; and I also took an interest in explaining mildly to Downes that he need not cry because the verb esse was irregular, or in reasoning Wilks Major out of a rooted suspicion of accusatives, or in fixing Walker's playful wits to the consideration of the difference between noun and adjective, or in criticising such free translation as Dura est via, \" the door is away,\" dubiously offered me by Skinny, for Avant of a better. So well did we get on together that I was almost sorry when the time came for a short interval. The Principal took himself off, with this injunction in his grandest tones \u2014 \" It is raining hard, so you must play here, the Prefects being responsible that no damage is done to the school furniture.\" I lingered behind a little, for I hardly knew what to do with myself. But, presently I followed him, thinking it fair to leave the boys to their romp, and now seeing a chance for the private interview I desired Avith their Principal. Pereira,"], [103, "The Vice- Principal. 91 I noticed, had an eye on my movements, and I feared he wanted to make himself offensive. To my surprise, he stepped forward, holding the door open for me with an obsequious smirk, then slammed it to as soon as I was out of the room. This sudden civility seemed too good to be true ; and I could not help asking myself what might be at the bottom of it. I had a guess, not very far from the mark, which made me turn before I got to the end of the passage, and walk back into the schoolroom. \" I'll teach you to be such a fool, \u2014 getting me into a scrape ! \" Avere the Avords that struck my ears as soon as I opened the door ; then this spectacle met my eyes. The Captain of the School was holding Smith fast, while Pereira put the helpless boy to torture by twisting his arm. It was for this he had been so willing to get me out of the way. \" You daren't touch me by yourself, you black bully!\" their victim Avas crying, roused out of his usual lackadaisical mood. Mardon, the first to catch sight of me, let him go like a hot potato. As soon as he found himself free, blind with anger, Smith flew at his tormentor, and planted a warty fist in Pereira's eye, so vigorously as to send him staggering backwards, bumping his head against the corner of my desk. The persecuted Skinny had the passions of his kind ; and I for one did not blame him."], [104, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 92 It all passed in a moment. I was hurrying forward to stop them ; but Pereira did not await a second bloAV. HoAvling for pain and rage, he fled before his desperate adversary, half a foot shorter as Smith was, and rushed out of the room, pursued by the hoots and jeers of the other boys, whose sympathies Avere not to be restrained by Mardon's presence or mine. I gave that loutish oppressor a bit of my mind, hot enough to send him slinking off ; and the rest, finding me on their side, did not hesitate to speak out. Walker, who was always as good as a chorus to me, explained the situation, pointing his else indefinite pronouns with significant emphasis and gestures, as Polonius, Avhen he says, \"Take this from this!\" \" He has gone to tell Mrs S. He will make a row. He will catch it.\" \"Yes, Avhat Paddy gave the drum ! \" said Wilks, with a glum chuckle, as if to encourage that hero of the moment. \" I don't care,\" broke out Skinny, his eyes still shining, and his cheeks glowing from the strife. \" It doesn't hurt when you don't deserve it.\" \" And if you can get it over while you are still in a stew,\" added Walker, with the sageness of experience. \" Anyhow, that stuck-up nigger will think twice before he tries to bully me again. I don't mind taking it for that,\" declared Smith, in the elliptical style that often serves to express schoolboy thought. \" Surely you have no reason to be afraid,\" said"], [105, "The Vice-Principal. 93 I. \" Dr Spick will not punish you when he hears hoAV it was. You have only to tell him what Pereira did to you.\" \" That's all you know about it ! \" the boys looked, if they did not say ; and Walker confi dentially informed me : \" You see, sir, Skinny is a much better hand with his fists than with his tongue. It Avags like a donkey's ears among the other fellows; but when he gets hauled up for anything, he is as dumb as a stuffed owl, and what he does mumble out is sure to be all Avrong, and only makes it Avorse for him.\" \" If that be so, he shall not Avant a Avitness and an advocate,\" vowed I to myself, tickled to remember how Nicholas Nickleby's scholastic career included some such episode. Smith had at least the benefit of being soon put out of suspense. While Ave were still talking over the incident, in strode the Principal in such haste that he had forgotten to crown himself Avith his mortar board, shoved on rather than attended by Mrs Spick, clamorously demanding justice, like Bruin the Bear before the judgment seat of King Lion. \" A shocking black eye, poor fellow, and a lump on his head as big as a sausage,\" she vociferated, unmindful of gentility in the wrath with which she pleaded her indictment. \" It is infamous ! It is abominable ! It is a mercy they have not killed him among them. But I will not allow such disgraceful doings \u2014 oh, you naughty boy!\" she"], [106, "A Schoolmasters Stories. 94 broke out at Skinny, and seemed ready to scratch him. \" To your seats ! \" commanded our dictator, in his most awful voice, beneath which I thought I could detect that he was feigning a height of dis pleasure he did not feel. Then, ascending his throne, he made solemn summons, \" Smith, stand forth ! \" Out came the accused, his hands now hanging awkwardly by his side. The short heat of that fray had given place to his usual tainted Avether-of the-flock look ; but he did not hang his head before the master's frown, though he turned away from the lady's vehement reproaches. \" Yes, you little ill-natured brat, I'll teach you to strike boys in school. It was you that spilt the ink, too, last Monday, over the dining-room table. You are the worst of the whole lot. But all this must be put a stop to. To fight Avith a harmless lad Avhose parents are in India, and he has nobody to protect him ! I hate a bully.\" \" Allow me, my dear,\" said Dr Spick, taking the matter out of her hands, to be treated in a more judicial spirit. \"William Smith, I am sorry to find that you have allowed your angry passions to carry you into an act of brutal A'iolence, rare, I trust, in this establishment. Have you any excuse to offer for breaking the rules of the college ? \" \" He must be whipped, of course,\" stormed our mistress, taking the culprit's defence out of his mouth, had he been able to make any. I judged it high time to interfere."], [107, "The Vice-Principal. 95 \" If you will allow me, I think I can show you that there is a mistake.\" \" The only mistake is your speaking when nobody asks you ! \" snapped she. I turned to her husband, and briefly gave my testimony as to what I had seen of the affair, and how Pereira was really in fault. The lady Avho had so hotly taken on herself the office of prose cutrix hardly let me finish my story. \" Pack of nonsense ! Where has Smith got a black eye to show \u2014 tell me that ! You mind your own business, and don't meddle, sir.\" At this slap in the face, I am afraid I bit my lips and allowed myself to be struck dumb. Braver men than I have quailed before a woman's tongue. I did venture to call upon Mardon for confirmation ; but he only growled out something about a \" piece of fun,\" like the lying bully he was. In indignant disgust I held my peace, afraid, indeed, of doing more harm than good to my client, who, at least, gave me the comfort of looking not too much concerned. Perhaps he knew Dr Spick Avas not likely to hurt him very much. He was a tough Smike or Smallbones, this, Avho bore himself like -one armed to suffer, standing silent, yet in an attitude that seemed to say \u2014 \"With all brief and plain conveniency Let me have judgment.\" And judgment our Solomon proceeded to deliver Avith the uncertain voice of one not fully persuaded in his own mind."], [108, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 96 \" You have engaged in an unseemly brawl.

But I cannot overlook such a flagrant case of disobedience.\" So he went on for a minute or two, evidently trying to work himself up to Rhadamanthine severity. His hesitation in enlarging upon the text of \" It must be, and yet it moves me, Romans ! \" encouraged one more effort on my part. \" If anybody is to be flogged, sir, it ought to be Pereira, as he began the affair.\" \" Are you the master here, or who is ? \" cried Mrs Spick, now in the part of Lady Macbeth, for her looks said plainly, Give vie the daggers I if that faint-hearted partner of hers could not be brought to the sticking point. He silenced her with a wave of his hand, as if assuring that he dared do all that might become a schoolmaster; then began to fumble Avith the lock of his desk. \" If Pereira broke the rules, he has suffered for his fault. Smith, I am always reluctant to birch a Sub-prefect, but there is no help for it.\" \" I should think not ! \" exclaimed his better half, who evidently meant to stay and see it done, to"], [109, "The Vice-Principal. 97 my confusion. Modesty, the custom of the classic stage, as of most public schools, and the precepts of the Ars Poetica alike prescribed that such tragic deeds should be enacted behind the scenes, and certainly not before a lady. But I was relieved when the Principal took out of his desk what seemed a strip of gutta-percha, flattened into a spoon-like shape at one end. Seeing, moreover, how the experienced Smith kept his hands clasped round the iron bar of a form, to numb his palm against the coming smart, I perceived that Dr Spick's birch, like his other collegiate institutions, was but a manner of speaking. This Aveak-kneed Orbilius descended from the rostrum where he was more at home, and gathering up his gown behind him with one hand, prepared to play the part of executioner. Skinny, Avithout a Avord, stood forward into the middle of the floor. In the part of injured innocent I Avas surprised to see how he bore himself with a certain dignity, as if the excitement of what was at hand roused him out of the dolefulness that seemed his natural mood. \" Since he stands obdurate, And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose My patience to his fury, and am armed To suffer, with a quietness of spirit, The very tyranny and rage of his.\" \" Hold forth your hand, sir,\" said the Doctor, awfully, and drew back to measure his distance. \" ' Oh, ye mistook !

But the age of chivalry is past. I thought rather of Don Quixote and Avhat happened to the lad Andres, so vainly delivered by him from the hands of a cruel master. I contented myself with sitting doAvn, as George III. did at the Athanasian Creed, and turning away my head in sign of protest, fully determined to make this injustice a handle for my own deliverance. But as I sat bridling my indignation, my nerves on edge for the sound of smacks and sobs, there came instead a startling knock at the door, Avith even more dramatic effect than that in Macbeth. \" Please, sir, a gentleman to see you,\" announced Ditcherly of the swollen cheek, Avhich made her no Venus, yet she appeared in the nick of time to save this Paris from his enemies. The visitor did not stand on further ceremony, but had already pushed in, and was walking up to the Principal's desk with an assurance few young men feel in a schoolroom. This Avas a lanky, cadaverous old man, as little of a gentleman as might be, dressed in greasy black, suggesting an undertaker on the look-out for a job. He kept his well-worn hat upon his head, and in his hand he carried certain official-like papers. Behind him, through the open door, appeared another ominous figure, still more lean, more shabby, but red-nosed rather than pale. I know not what impression of calamity was at once conveyed to me by the very faces of these unknown visitors."], [111, "The Vice- Principal. 99 As for Dr Spick, no sheeted ghost could have worked such immediate dismay on him as this apparition in broad daylight. The instrument of correction fell from his unnerved hand, amid a silence in which you might have heard a pin drop, but for the creaking of the stranger's muddy boots. With eyes fixed on him as if fascinated, white as the chalky signs on the blackboard, the poor Doctor shrank back to his desk, where he would fain have taken sanctuary, but stood fast like one palsied, awaiting a stroke more dire than any he had been about to bestow. All his swelling dignity had collapsed, and he seemed to wither up, blighted by the approach of that dark shadow on his pride and power. It may have been with me as Avith Partridge at the play : \" When I saw the little man so frightened himself, it was that which took hold of me.\" \"Who is this? What does he want?\" demanded Mrs Spick ; but in a voice that showed how her stern spirit, too, had caught the infection of alarm. Heedless of froAvns as of terror, the intruder approached, exhibited his papers, and spoke certain Avords in a low tone ; then if ever I saw a man's jaw drop, it was my Principal's. So painful was the sight, I looked aside, as I heard a shrill scream proclaiming that Mrs Spick threatened to faint away. At once all became commotion : and the next thing I was aware of was the Principal standing beside me, muttering in broken despair \u2014"], [112, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 100 \" You can't lend me fifteen pounds, can you ? \" I shook my head in silent pity. I had an inkling now of what was the matter, and made for the door, feeling myself de trop in such a scene. The last I saAv and heard of Dr Spick was his feeble effort to man himself into a \" Take an inventory of all I have\" mien, while his wife alternately wrung her hands and abused the ministers of the law in querulous tones ; and Smith still stood out on the floor like the Pompeian sentry who Avould not, without command, leave his post, when all around him Avas falling in ruin. Ah, Skinny, my boy, two minutes more and you Avould have been the hero of the tragedy; but even if scourged to a Fury's content, you might Avell have refused to exchange lots with that unhappy pair ! \" I have done my best. Everything has gone Avrong,\" stammered the unhappy Principal, and there Avas infinite pathos in his feeble command \u2014 \" Boys, you can go ! \" In the days of his greatness, he was Avont to dismiss us Avith Licet, Avhich he had picked up as a form in use at some public school.

What are we to do ? \" \" I don't know.\" I could answer him only in these words, Avhich some philosophers have con sidered an expression of the highest Avisdom. As for me, I had taken a sudden decision what to do."], [113, "The Vice-Principal. 101 Thinking over it, I see a Vice-Principal might have stood by his wreck a little longer ; but at the time I was too excited to lose such an oppor tunity of leaving the sinking ship. I ran up to my room, and packed my bag. Luckily the trunk containing most of my impedi menta was not yet come from the railway. Five minutes served me to make ready, and five more to write a hurried note to Dr Spick, in which you may guess what leave I took of him. This, and half a crown, I gave to Ditcherly, Avhom, more faithful servant than me, I found weeping over her employers' misfortune. As I passed out, I saw Pereira's salloAv face peep for a moment from the door of the \" study,\" Avhere he had betaken himself, perhaps scared by the revolution, perhaps unwilling to trust himself among the other boys Avho had gathered in the playground, strangely silent for once, Avhile Mrs Spick's hysterical screams could now be heard all over the house. He did not speak, but rolled at me his stealthy black eyes, dilated by fear or hatred. Resisting the temptation to let this fellow know what I thought of him, with no more ado I shook the dust off my feet against the Royal Southern Collegiate Institution, and bid farewell to all the greatness of Vice-Principalship. \" Forfend thilk days should e'er return !\" Fortune favoured my flight. At the station I found a train about to start for London. I had come down first class, as became a Vice-Principal. Now I took a third-class ticket, to suit my altered"], [114, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 102 prospects; and, in such haste was I to catch the train, that I jumped into a compartment reserved for certain jail-birds. In every respect, but that of dismal weather, my experience was the reverse of Eugene Aram's. His scholastic career, Ave remember, ended in his setting out from Lynn, handcuffed between two stern-faced men. My lot was to travel as far as Lewes in company with one very jovial and chatty minister of the law; and the gyves Avere upon the wrists of two miserable wretches in his charge, no doubt on their way to prison. I felt as if I had just got out of one. This circumstance is connected, in my mind, with the next I heard of \" Dr \" Spick. A year or two later, the newspapers told how he had set up as a practitioner of medicine, Avithout providing himself with the desirable qualifications, \"being too tender hearted to go through the usual course of hospital studies,\" as his counsel put it to the jury. For one of his first patients happened to be an elderly lady, Avho died too soon under his hands ; and the self-dubbed doctor utriusque juris was thereupon brought to trial, and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. I Avas sorry to learn that he thus fell on evil days. Whatever his faults, the man showed himself friendly and not incon- siderate towards me during our brief acquaintance, and I had no personal complaint to make of him, except as in being the Vice of such a Principal, both of us the wrong men in the wrong place."], [115, "103 THE NEPHEW AND THE UNCLE. I. After my brief career as a Vice-Principal, I came back to London lodgings, but did not long remain there. To live in London is a liberal education, an advantage which I have enjoyed only by dearly prized snatches, dreaming rather than doing amid its fumum et opes strepitumque, a reverent and envious outsider. As Charles Lamb in his vacation visits to Oxford, I have often conferred on myself in imagination the freedom of the City, or taken my degree ad eundem in the honour lists of the West End. \" When the peacock vein rises,\" I strut an habitue\" of the Row, at least a Templar; in my moods of humility I inhabit an industrious Grub Street attic, or return punctually to tea by the Camden Town or the Clapham 'bus.

I had not intended seeking another post as schoolmaster. Scholastic ambition, it seemed,"], [116, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 104 should be made of sterner stuff. Yet now oppor tunity came thrust upon me. A certain prominent citizen of a rising town in what were then the further outskirts of Canada, had conceived the idea of founding a college, upon a scale proportioned to the hopes rather than to the needs of the neighbour hood. This munificently-minded educationalist was minded himself to be the first Principal; but to give eclat to the enterprise, he had commissioned certain pundits of the mother country, one of them my old college tutor, to send out two English university men as classical and as mathematical masters for the new institution. I believe the first of these appointments had already, upon inquiry, been declined by more deserving nominees, when it was proposed to me, saute de mieux. In per plexity and doubtful dilemma what to do with myself, I could not refuse this unexpected offer; and westward, now, the star of my fortunes took its way. But story I have none to tell at present of adventures in Canada. Once more, as ill luck would have it, I turned out to have brought my talents, such as they Avere, to a bad market. That contemporary fundator noster died suddenly while I was still on my voyage across the Atlantic, leaving his heirs ill-disposed to fulfil ambitious intentions which had already suggested to them a commission of lunacy. The shell of the college stood already visible in a wilderness of blackened stumps and undrained bog-holes; but there Avere no pupils, no furniture, no books, and no settled"], [117, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 105 endowment as yet. Before setting out, I had been paid my travelling expenses, with a year's salary in advance. Future supplies depended on the public spirit of the young community, which was more concerned about getting a railway than a high-toned Seminary, for by no less magniloquent a name had the abortive school been christened from its inception. In this discouraging state of affairs, I remained idle for more than a year, \" eating our heads off,\" as my mathematical colleague, a gentleman of sporting proclivities, Avas pleased to express it. I am sorry to say that he took to drinking for want of better idleness, and eventually came down to be boots at the inn where we boarded together on our first arrival : that was a sad tale only too often to be told in those parts. For very shame, however, I would not let myself be classed among the loafers of the town, \"the double-shuffle man from the States,\" and the wreck of a once dandy officer, whose friends kept him here out of the way on a scrimp allowance, to poison himself slowly with bad whisky. I had plenty of time for reading and for writing; then I got a few private pupils without much difficulty, being, indeed, a Triton of learning among the local minnows. And so I remained on the spot, making the best of a winter of discontent, in vain hopes that the seminary, and with it my mastership, might yet blossom into efficiency. One of those pupils was a half-breed young Indian chief, whom his white friends desired to bring up in decency and order, and sought to"], [118, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 106 secure this end by employing a superiorly-qualified instructor like myself, though as a matter of fact any experienced pupil-teacher would have made a more practical mentor in such a case. I confess to feeling at first not a little afraid of my tawny Telemachus, who had the reputation of having been already on the war-path, and might give way to ancestral tomahawking instincts if I criticised his spelling too closely or distressed him with the rule of three. But, in his \"store-clothes,\" this scion of a grimly-famous race proved no unamenable scholar, with occasional bursts of sullenness and laziness, indeed, but on the whole taking not unkindly to the three Rs \u2014 we got little further \u2014 which he probably regarded as \"great medicine,\" and me as a \" pow wow\" of the first Avater. We became so friendly, after a shy fashion on both sides, that in summer I accompanied him on a visit to his tribe. Here I began to make obser vations and inquiries on Indian life, which were worth to me my first introduction into literature; and here I met with certain experiences which were worth relating, if I had not to hurry on to quite a different subject. They were not very ferocious or romantic savages, these, as any one can guess who knows that part of Canada; but in my future schoolmastering it has been no small point to my credit with English boys that I once for a fortnight lived among real Red Indians and came back unscalped. The only torments I suffered in my red brother's Avigwam were from fleas and mosquitoes, Avhich played the very Mingo"], [119, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 107 with the Paleface; neither trusty rifle nor glittering bowie knife would have been of so much use to me as a small-tooth comb, or a smelling-bottle. To be brief, I Avrote an article on certain Indian customs, Avhich Avas accepted by a well-known English magazine. This brought me into corre spondence with the author of a not quite so Avell known book, dealing at length with the references to Totemism in Greek authors, Avho on this subject are more trustworthy guides than Fenimore Cooper. One or two of my statements pleased the scholarly Avriter as going to confirm his theories, a matter neither here nor there for the present purpose. The point is that he Avas then headmaster of a school, the name of Avhich does not concern the reader. Enough to say, that while not one of our first public schools, it holds a fair place in the second rank. The Canadian College scheme remaining at a dead lock, no further emoluments forthcoming, I sought this influential correspon dent's advice ; and the end of it was that he offered me a post on his own staff, Avhich I might Avell regard as a feather in my cap. Thus I made a fresh start as a schoolmaster under more favourable auspices than I could have expected after those two false ones ; and so, by roundabout tacks, I have got the Avind at last in the sail of my story, whose title is no plagiarism from Schiller, but forced upon me by the facts of the case. The only draAvback to my satisfaction was that I had an uncle already at this school, not as a master, but as a pupil. You may think I am"], [120, "108 A Schoolmasters Stories. joking, but it is not so. Such a thing may happen to any one Avho comes, as I do, of a good large family. The case stood thus. My uncle, John Ferrier, now entering his teens, Avas the youngest of a brood of twelve, among Avhom my mother had been the eldest ; then, she being married and settled long before the birth of this boy, I had the advantage of him in coming into the world by some eighth part of a century or so ; yet all the same, Avhen he did come, there could be no denying that he must be my uncle. The differ ence in age is why, like Cardinal Wolsey, with his ego et rex metis, I put myself first, and mention the uncle after the nephew. It so happened that hitherto I had met this youngest uncle of mine only once in my life, Avhile he was a baby and I myself an overgrown school boy, rather too conscious of the manly dignity to which I Avas aspiring, and sensitive to a thick crop of family jokes about being set to rock my Uncle John's cradle, tying on my uncle's bib, and so forth. Ever since, my visits to his father, that is, my grandfather, had taken place at times when the boy Avas at the seaside, recovering from the measles, or at school, or staying with some school-fellow ; and thus it came that I had never set eyes on my Uncle John except as a little bundle of pink flesh and white baby clothes ; sadly given to squealing, and taken a great deal too much notice of by the ladies, as I thought, like a lofty-minded hobbledehoy that I was. So now, I felt no little curiosity to know what"], [121, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 109 sort of a fellow he had turned out, and how we should get on together in our complicated relationship. Familiarity on the part of the uncle, and respect on that of the nephew, would be clearly out of place in this case. If he Avere a graceless urchin, he might presume on the ties of kindred to be too free and easy in his manner towards me ; then it would be my duty to snub him. On the other hand, might not a certain shade of modified deference be appropriate in my own bearing towards one who, after all, must be regarded as my senior in the family ? One question seemed happily settled : as his nephew and his master I need not \" tip \" him. I could only hope that we might be good friends in private life, and that my official functions would never compel me to treat him in any way unbecoming a nephew, or give my young uncle cause to complain of me as \"a little more than kin and less than kind.\" From the moment of arrival, I kept my eyes sharply about me to see if I could distinguish my uncle among some hundreds of boys just returned from their Easter holidays. But all these round jackets and black neckties looked to me very much alike ; I found no face recognisable by a family resemblance, and I did not recollect any photograph of John Ferrier later than the age of short petticoats and long curls. Only one boy out of the whole mass attracted special attention by the fact of his having a boil on the point of his nose. I had a presentiment this might turn out"], [122, "A Schoolmasters Stories. 110 to be my uncle, and was in half a mind to speak to him on the chance ; but Avhen I saw how dirty his nails were, and how untidily his hair was brushed, I trusted he might be no relation what ever to me. There Avas no time to make inquiries then, as I was engaged to dinner at the Warden's. To him I mentioned that I was not the only member of my family in the school. \"Ah, Ferrier \u2014 a very decent fellow, I believe,\" said our Chief. \"At least, I know very little about him, and that is no bad sign of a boy below my own form. Well, we must have your uncle up and let you make his acquaintance.\" So, forthAvith, a message was sent inviting Ferrier to tea in the sacred precincts of the Warden's lodge. An invitation from the head of our little state being, of course, equivalent to a command, John did not fail to present himself at eight o'clock in the drawing-room, where we found him playing chess with the lady of the house when Ave came upstairs after dinner. One glance at him went far to relieve me of any apprehensions I might have felt as to this kinsman of mine. He Avas a sensible, gentlemanly-looking lad, quiet and unaffected in his manners, Avho without being sheepishly bashful, evidently knew how to behave himself in the presence of his elders and betters. Clearly an uncle of whom I need have no reason to be ashamed ! And now that I came to look at him, he Avas as like my mother as he could stare. My heart soon Avarmed towards him, and two minutes after our"], [123, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 111 introduction we were exchanging news of a wide spread aunthood and cousinhood as freely as if we had known each other all our lives. The Warden's Avife moved away, leaving us alone together in a corner of the room, Avhere we had a good long talk. Then, as the boy civilly volunteered to set down my teacup for me, I Avas moved to enter upon one of the difficulties that I felt Avith regard to him. \" I say, Avhat are we to call each other ? \" I put it to him. \"Whatever you like, sir',' said he, with a dimple on his frank face that showed him not without an eye for the ludicrous aspects of our situation, yet in a respectful tone, acquitting him of any desire to presume upon it. Thus Ave settled it, there and then. When by ourselves I should call him John, and he might call me \u2014 never mind what. It seemed hardly proper that I should accost my uncle as Johnny or Jack, one or other of which appellations I believe he got generally at home ; still less was it to be thought of that he should avail himself of the term of endearment attached to me in the family circle. Before others, Ave were always to be \"Ferrier\" and \"Mr So-and-So.\" And if he got into scrapes, I carefully warned him, he must expect no leniency from me, for it seemed we were likely to have a good deal to do with each other in the Avay of business. \"All right,\" he said, with a pleasant laugh. \" I'm not the sort of fellow to get much into"], [124, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 112 scrapes, but if I do, you must pitch into me, of course.\" Then we shook hands on it, said good-night, and parted excellent friends, not a little to my relief. What a nuisance it would have been to me if my uncle had proved to be an ill-conditioned lout, or a booby, or one of the scapegraces of the school ! Our peculiar relationship, however, could not be concealed, and I had a good deal of chaff to bear on the score of it from my colleagues. Many were the jests in our common room at my expense. I was asked if my uncle gave me good advice, if he ever offered to take me out for the day, if he had promised to send home a good report of me, and the like, for masters, in their hours of ease, are not always the grave beings they appear to idle scholars, and a very little joke went a long way with some of my fellow pedagogues at \u2014 there now ! I was on the point of letting slip the name of this school, which Avild horses could not tear from me. The boys, too, doubtless, did not fail to have their fun off my nephewhood, always, of course, behind my back. The first time I had to rebuke my uncle in public, for shying crusts across the table at dinner-time, or some other such venial levity, I could notice a grin on the face of more than one humorous young gentleman, and I felt rather uncomfortable about it, for I cannot bear to be in a ludicrous position. But, to do him justice, Uncle John gave me not much uneasiness"], [125, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 113 in this Avay. I do not mean to say that he was a model youth, the good boy of our old stories, that character whom neither schoolboys nor school masters nor modern story-tellers have any patience with, who is good chiefly for Avant of spirit to be anything else, which I take to have been the main virtue of those \" blameless \" Ethiopians mentioned by Homer. John, like the rest of us, did not always show himself all that he ought to have been, but he was not sore at being found fault with when he deserved it, and had generally the sense to take a telling from those set over him without requiring them to use such arguments as, we are informed on high authority, have force with a fool. Sunday was the day for intimate friends and brothers to go Avalking together, and on Sunday afternoons, after chapel, I used to invite my uncle to take a stroll Avith me, Avhen we could have a friendly conversation, for which there was little opportunity during the Aveek. We had plenty to talk about besides our relations ; he was a thoughtful boy for his age, with a decided taste for natural history and other matters not always interesting to youngsters. One subject, however, was tacitly tabooed between us : Ave never mentioned anything done or said in school. So long, indeed, as we Avere in sight of the other boys, I fancied I could notice a certain restraint in John's manner towards me, as if he feared to be suspected of telling tales of his companions or A trying to curry favour with me as a master, it"], [126, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 114 and of course I carefully respected this delicacy of feeling, for I should not have been proud of an uncle Avho played the sneak even for my information. To tell the truth, there were a good many tales to be told out of that school at that time. The year before, under the rule of an incompetent master, a series of disturbances had taken place, amounting almost to an open rebellion, which is still remembered as a dangerous crisis in the history of the institution. Our present head master \u2014 I beg his pardon, the Warden, he was very particular about his proper title \u2014 had come into office at Christmas, and at once set about restoring order Avith the proverbial energy of a new broom. Broom is not in this case wholly a metaphor ; it was an instrument of the same genus which mainly served him as an olive branch, an instrument once as much in the hands of schoolmasters as the lancet in those of the medical profession. I speak things not unknown to most public schoolboys of the last generation, nor, indeed, to a few woeful young wights of the present day. By the use of this and other means of persuasion, he had succeeded in sweeping or swishing aAvay most of the symptoms of unruliness; yet the community could hardly be said to be in a state of moral convalescence, and every now and again occurred little relapses of turbulence which required us to keep a sharp eye on the youthful body committed to our charge. Readers who recall my mishaps as a Vice-"], [127, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 115 Principal may well ask how I managed to keep my head above these troubled Avaters. But custom makes something else than coAvards of us all ; Ave know that recruits who turn pale and Avould like, if they dared, to turn tail on first smelling the smoke of a battlefield, come in time to take it all as a matter of course, and will stand cool as cucumbers amid the hottest fire, having learned to make as light as may be of the screeching and the Avhistling of shells and bullets. Such is scholastic life, too, so you may believe me Avhen I say that I soon got into the Avay of being strict \u2014 all the stricter, perhaps, from the'consciousness of my former failure in this respect. Some of those under me, indeed, thought me too strict, but of course they were not the best judges on such a point. My form consisted of almost the smallest boys in the school, Avho would have been overawed by a very scarecrow of a master stuffed with old exercise books, so long as he represented an impressive order of things Avith Avhich they, on their side, had not yet grown irreverently familiar. This, however, was only part of my duties. The school buildings were divided into blocks, or \" houses,\" in the upper storeys of Avhich were the dormitories, each house being under the care of a master responsible for the orderliness and minor morals of its inmates. I had charge of one of these, known to the authorities as D House, and to the boys as \" Newgate \" \u2014 I suppose from the superior strength of its bolts and bars. It Avas in this house that Uncle John had his nest. If all"], [128, "116 A Sc/ioolmaster's Stories. the others had been like him, my task would have been an easy one ; but they were not, and I often had a good deal of trouble with them, so that at times I got into a jaundiced mood, in # which I wished that schools had never been invented, and thought it would be better to tend ostriches or buffaloes or wild asses of the desert, or any the most obstinate animals, rather than boys. Every month there Avas a meeting of the masters at the Warden's lodge, to hear the result of his monthly examinations of our forms, and discuss the state of the school generally. These young monkeys little kneAV hoAV, Avhen they were safe in bed, we used to get hauled over the coals if any thing had gone wrong, for our Chief had a close eye upon all the details of school life, and was diligent in keeping his subordinates of every rank up to the mark. On this occasion he had found fault all round, pointed out several matters that Avere amiss, and ended by a general injunction to tighten the reins of discipline. \" I will back you up \u2014 depend upon that,\" he assured us benignantly, to raise our spirits, drooping under his censure. \" But remember, when you give boys an inch they will take an ell, and if we once get back into those easy-going ways, there is an end of all discipline.\" The Warden had most of the talking to himself that night, and the meeting broke up early. As I crossed the quadrangle I was somewhat astonished to see the Avindows of one of the dormitories in my house still lit up, and when I drew nearer there"], [129, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 117 were heard most untimely and illegal sounds of uproar. Our rule Avas strict, that every boy must be quiet in bed fifteen minutes after going upstairs. At the end of that time it was the duty of one of the prefects to go round and see all lights out. My visits of superintendence Avere paid at uncertain times, as often as I thought my presence desirable. \"Ah ha!\" quoth one of my colleagues, Avho Avas Avalking with me. \" The reins of discipline Avant tightening here, don't they ? \" and I hurried on to make immediate inquisition into these doings. I Avalked firmly along the passage in my creaking shoes, for it was a point of honour with some of us, though we got little credit for it, not to take our flocks unaAvares. But the boys of this room were making such a din of their own that they never heard the noise of my approach, and I opened the door to find them, my uncle and all, full in a game of high jinks. In a state of extreme undress, they appeared to be chevying one another over and under the beds. I have reason to believe that the idea of the pro ceedings Avas a fox-hunt, and that Uncle John was playing the part of fox, though I cannot see how pelting the fox with sponges and pillows enters into any fair representation of this sport, upon Avhich I intruded, unwelcome as a cat in a game of skittles, as the French proverb has it. Indeed, at the first wind of me, hounds, huntsman, and fox all ran hastily to earth, that is, to their beds, where"], [130, "118 A Schoolmaster's Stories. they lay looking somewhat foolish, when I sternly inquired \u2014 \" Why are you boys not in bed ? \" \" Is it time, sir ? \" asked one youth, Avith an extremely Aveak affectation of innocence. \" Time ! yes, and long after the proper time, as you know very well.\" \" But the Prefect has not been round yet,\" argued another. This Avas a felloAV much given to arguing, who, according to his OAvn account, was in a chronic state of ill-usage by the masters. I forget his real name, but he Avent in the school by that of \" Toby,\" a sobriquet he must have owed to his nose and mouth, which Avere not unlike the muzzle of a surly bulldog. \" That's no reason for you to be out of bed,\" I rejoined. \" But we thought \u2014 \" said Toby, sitting up in bed to discuss the matter Avith me in full. \" You had no business to think,\" quoth I, cutting short the argument by turning out the gas. \" Your business is to obey the rules, and I shall talk to all of you about this to-morrow morning.\" Even in the dark, Toby on behalf of himself and his accomplices, Avould have \" Pleaded still, not guilty, and alleged Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.\" But I left their room to go off in search of the Prefect who had thus failed in the charge entrusted to him. As I expected, I found him in his study, buried in books and papers as deep as a rising"], [131, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 119 barrister. He was an absent-minded, laborious fellow, who, if such a fault should be found with a schoolboy, showed himself too anxious about his work. So absorbed in it was he now that he did not notice my entrance, till I touched him on the shoulder. \" What have you been about, Mason ? \" \" Oh, sir ! \" he exclaimed, starting, as he suddenly became aAvare of his negligence. \" Is it time to gc round the rooms? I quite forgot it to-night.\" \" Well, never mind this time, but don't let it occur again. I am afraid, Mason, you will addle your brains for the examination. The more haste the less speed, you know, is apt to be the case in these matters.\" I spoke thus unreproachfully, because I knew him to be well-meaning, even painfully con scientious about his duty; but all this term he had been working at high pressure for a Cambridge scholarship, and the fear was he might break down from over-eagerness. After a few more words of friendly counsel I wished him good-night. I could afford to forgive Mason for such an omission once in a way; Avhile I could not see that there was any excuse for the uproariousness of Toby and his friends. The fellows in all the other rooms had put out the lights for themselves and gone duly to bed at the proper time. These boys must have known they were wrong in not doing the same, and certainly deserved punish ment. The fact that my Uncle John Avas one of the culprits only made me more resolved"], [132, "A Schoolmaster s Stories. 120 on severity. Nobody should have a chance of saying that I dealt too tenderly with my OAvn family's flesh and blood. For his sake, and for that of some of the rest, who, in general, were well-behaved fellows, I should like to have let them all off; but we must be just before we are generous, as young Benjamin Franklin said to his nurse when she offered to give him a Avhipping. People tell me that I am a very garrulous story teller; and, as usual, I have this time been so long about introducing my characters and describing the situation that I must take breath to begin a new chapter before fairly plunging into the full current of my narrative, which, I can assure the gentle reader meamvhile, will be a most moving and eventful one. II. NEXT morning the little troop of offenders appeared before me after breakfast, at Avhich hour I was Avont, when necessary, to hold a sort of police-court for dealing Avith minor questions of discipline. Unlike the proceedings of other courts, mine generally began by passing sentence, as I had in most cases already formed a pretty fair notion of the guilt or innocence of the parties concerned : so now I rebuked my uncle and the rest, ordering them all, as a punishment, to copy out two pages of Bradshaw before tea-time. This"], [133, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 121 Avas a new form of imposition, my own invention, I believe, on Avhich I rather prided myself, as both more profitable and formidable to the victim than the customary Latin or Greek lines. Generally, there was no more to be said when I had thus given judgment in the lofty style mentioned by the poet, \" I am a blessed Glendoveer, 'Tis mine to speak, and yours to hear. But in this instance my decision Avas not allowed to passed unchallenged. Master Toby, Avho seldom let himself be punished without showing all possible cause to the contrary, at once moved for a Avrit of error, arguing, very ingeniously, that Avhen the Prefect did not come round as usual, he and his companions had a right to assume that their time Avas not up; that the very fact of appointing an overseer in this matter removed all responsibility from them, trust being the necessary antecedent of good faith, as the old legal maxim has it ; and that, in short \u2014 though you are not to suppose he used such fine language \u2014 the onus probandi lay entirely upon me, to convince them of a conscious breach of duty. To this I replied at some length, upholding my judgment. I pointed out that their allegiance Avas not to the Prefect but to the rules of the school, that two blacks did not make a Avhite, that they must have known perfectly well it was long past the hour for going to bed, and that in no case had they any business to be making a hubbub in their"], [134, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 122 dormitory, at all events that I meant to put doAvn such doings. I am inclined to think that, as with a certain celebrated judge, it was a mistake of mine to enter so much into my reasons ; boys are not logical beings, and seem to agree better with the blunt conclusions of an off-hand despotism. Admitting them to argument is only inviting them to complaint. So now some of my penitents retired in evident dissatisfaction, especially Toby, who looked as if he Avould have liked to snap my nose off. I reminded them, indeed, that they had a right to appeal to the Warden, but their confidence in the justice of their cause was not strong enough to run the risk of such an attempt. Then I had Mason at me in no little distress. He declared it Avas all his fault, and wanted to do an imposition himself, so that the other boys might be let off for this once. But I Avould not hear of this. I showed him there was a difference between a fellow like him, who could be talked to reasonably when he made a mistake once in a way, and a tribe of mischievous young monkeys against whose noc turnal riots I had already had cause to animadvert sharply. They needed this lesson ; he, I hoped, Avould take a hint for the future without any unpleasant jogging of his memory. To quiet his conscience, however, I confined him to the gates for the rest of the week, a very nominal punish ment, as I knew he Avould be spending every spare minute over his books at any rate. Thus firmly had I laid down the laAv, but when"], [135, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 123 I came to think over it, I Avas not sure if I had been altogether right. These boys had certainly broken a plain rule, yet might I not have made some allowance for them under the circumstances? I wished now I could have let them off Avithout any compromise of my authority. All the time of my schoolmastership I was given to self-tormenting of this kind. And the worst of it was that I credited boys with a similar delicacy of feeling, and Avas always fancying them as ill-naturedly reviewing my decisions, when the truth probably was that most of them dismissed such thoughts from their buoyant minds more readily than I did. The day having begun ill, everything else, of course, showed a tendency to go Avrong. I Avas out of spirits, not to say cross ; and I have often noticed that Avhen a master's temper is bad, the boys seem to behaA'e badly, as if in sympathy with his mood. I had a keen eye that morning for many petty naughtinesses among my pupils, and sharp were the punishments with which I vexed their small souls. The same thing appeared to be going on more or less over the whole school : the fruit of our Head's hint about \" tightening the reins of discipline.\" The detention room was full of misdoers, and at twelve o'clock I saw quite a knot of more mournful victims waiting outside of a certain dreadful door for the arrival of the Warden. Here, at this hour, the last penalty of our law was used to be administered \u2014 that penalty alluded to by a late well-known Warden, who, being a man nervous in speech as well as humane"], [136, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 124 in action, is said to have astonished the school one day by announcing that he meant to abolish capital punishment except in certain very exceptional cases ! He meant a punishment which has been more aptly described as \" the reverse of capital.\" I mention this matter because my tale draws near a tragic point at which one of my characters is unfortunately to be led out to execution. In due time, the little pile of pages of Bradshatv was brought me by one of the culprits, the rest, as I imagined, keeping clear of me to express their resentment for lost hours of play. I Avas aware that my neAv-fangled kind of imposition excited the liveliest disapproval. Boys sympathise with that principle of English law Avhich forbids unusual punishments. They are the very slaves of custom, and Avill submit with more or less cheerfulness to inflictions sanctioned by immemorial usage, while they kick under light burdens for which no pre cedent exists. I could divine their opinion without having it put into words. Toby had looked very surly at me as often as I came across him during the day. Even Uncle John seemed to avoid me, as if I had been placed in moral quarantine by the general sentiment of his companions. In the evening, as I Avas going over the quad rangle, I passed a group of the boys who had got into trouble with me, laying their heads closely together. They turned to look after me with no friendly faces ; a sensitive instinct suggested that they were discussing me, and I could almost fancy that I heard them saying in something like the"], [137, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 125 Avords of Hotspur, \"A good plot, good friends, and full of expectation ! \" or, to my dyspeptic view, these chubby-cheeked urchins Avere not unlike the Avitches in Macbeth, to Avhom the ill-favoured Toby must be declaring, \" I'll do, and I'll do, and I'll do ! \" What could they be about ? It would only be for want of power, and by no means of will, if they Avere not hatching something against my peace of mind. That night, when the boys had gone to bed, I Avent round the house myself to see that all Avas quiet. Then in a very downcast mood, instead of going to our common-room to read the papers as usual, I shut myself in my own den, and sitting alone in the dusk, gave up my thoughts to gloomy meditation. I had more than half a mind to renounce this business of boy-leading, so uncon genial in many Avays to my disposition. Somehow or other I felt that I had made myself unpopular in the school, and could not bear to feel it. And how Avas this ? I was conscious of having tried hard to do my duty. I seemed to myself to deserve the confidence and goodwill of these boys more than some others who Avere more successful in obtaining it. There Avas my colleague So-and- So, for instance, a rough, hasty, passionate fellow, who made no scruple, Avhen the fit was on him, of knocking his pupils about him like so many nine pins. Yet they put up with much from him, and got on well with him on the whole, for the sake of a certain knack Avhich he had, and I hadn't, of hitting off their humour in the article of govern-"], [138, "126 A Schoolmaster's Stories. ment. On the other hand, there was the Warden, calm, lofty, severe, far more exacting than I durst be \u2014 but who so bold as to criticise or even murmur at his \" absolute shall \" ! My own course seemed to fall half Avay between these two standards of action. I irritated without overawing, and coaxed without winning ; and the boys neither respected me nor liked me : so I told myself, and felt quite unhappy about it. Then certain other considerations came to the rescue, for I Avas no longer a green youth to yield blindly to the prompting of the moment. \" Come now, this is all nonsense,\" my inner and more experienced self said to my foolish outer self, so liable to suffer from mere impressions. \" You are out of sorts to-night, and, as usual, you exaggerate evils. Go to bed Avith you, and have a good night's rest, and to-morrow you Avill see things in a truer and brighter light. The fact is that you are neither better nor worse than the majority of schoolmasters, as schoolmasters go, only perhaps more sensitive to the difficulty of your position. What is all this fuss about ? Because, forsooth, a disobedient boy has looked ugly at you when you punished him as he deserved ! Why, by to-morrow he will have forgotten all about it. We knoAV that ' a boy's will is the Avind's will,' but a man is not to be bloAvn about by every puff of feeling or fancy. Your course is to go steadily on, Avithout fear or favour, and if you do your duty, you need not be afraid but that these boys will respect you for it when they grow old enough to have more sense \u2014"], [139, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 127 or if not, their respect Avill never be Avorth having. Therefore henceforth \u2014 1 Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care AVho chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.' Anyhow, it will be all the same a hundred years hence. Will it, though, by the way ? Should I be so much concerned about Avhat will make these thoughtless urchins and me get on pleasantly together from day to day, and not rather about what is to be the outcome of all this treadmill of petty toils and tribulations, on Avhich it is my task to keep their unwilling feet going ? Am I not thinking too much of my own comfort, and too little of their real Avelfare ? \" Thus I began to fall into a train of more serious reflection, when I was startled by a slight noise, a creaking of the floor above, quite audible in the stillness which reigned throughout the house. It was my bedroom which lay overhead. At this hour nobody had any business to be there except myself, but somebody surely was there, and seemed to be moving about the room with stealthy tread. Instantly I recalled the group of boys in the quadrangle, and my vague suspicion that they must be plotting something against me. Did my fretful nerves deceive me, or was that a burst of stifled laughter ? I opened the door and listened. All was dark and silent in the passages, but above I heard a door softly opened and another pushed-to, and I fancied I could distinguish the patter of naked feet."], [140, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 128 No boy had any right to be going from room to room at this hour. \" Marry, this is miching mallecho\" quoth I to myself. Some mischief was afoot, and something must be done at once to nip it in the bud. I looked about for a candlestick. Of course when one is in a particular hurry, the matches are never to be found for a minute or two ; then two or three were scraped in vain by my impatient fingers, and the first one which I succeeded in lighting spluttered out to no purpose. When I got my candle lit, it was presently blown out by a draught, so I had to return for another match. But at last I Avas ready to set forth to the scene of suspicion, and hastened upstairs. I have mentioned that I usually scorned to take the boys unawares ; but this time I felt justified in being rather sly in my approach. Quickly and cautiously I reached my bedroom without giving any alarm. The door was half ajar. I slipped in and saw a boy in his nightdress standing beside the bed, from which he started back at my sudden appearance. He was evidently doing something wrong, and who could he be ? \" Oh my prophetic soul \u2014 my uncle ! \" Yes, it Avas the confused and crimsoned face of John Ferrier on which the light of the candle fell. \" Take any shape but that ! \" I would have heartily cried, if I might have made choice of the disturber of my rest \u2014 for with Avhat other motive could he be visiting my chamber in this unlawful way? \"What are you doing here ?\" I asked, sharply."], [141, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 129 \"Nothing,\" he faltered, in painful embarrassment, at a loss for what else to say, yet knowing well that I could not believe him. Now I noticed that the bedclothes were in disorder. I pulled them off, and saw lying near the foot of the bed some singular objects which my short-sighted eyes did not at once serve me to recognise by the candlelight. I put down my hand to touch them, but drew it sharply back with an exclamation of pain. Thistles ! Then I turned upon the boy, shrinking before my looks of indig nation, he who, so long as his conscience upheld him, would not have flinched before even the thundering voice of the Warden uttering terrible things. Oh, the young scoundrel ! Was this the purpose Avith Avhich he had stolen into his nephew's chamber ? \" John,\" I cried, in a tone of bitter reproach, and he hung down his head and had not a Avord to say for himself. For a moment I had almost given way, bursting out into a torrent of passionate rebuke. But failing to find fit words to express my Avrath, with an effort I commanded myself, and only said, quietly, \" I should not have thought such a thing of you, John. If you play these Avretched tricks on me, what am I to expect from the other boys ? You shall hear more about this to-morrow ; meantime, go!\" He lingered, as if desirous of speaking to make vain excuses for himself. \" Go !\" I repeated, sternly, unable to trust myself 1"], [142, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 130 in the room with him ; \" I will not hear a word. Stop ! as you put these things there, you may as Avell take them away.\" I pointed to the thistles, which, now that I came to look, had a few nettle leaves and one or two thorny sprigs among them \u2014 a formidable snare for my poor feet. Still keeping his face turned away from me, he gathered up this unseemly botanical collection in his bare hands, heedless of the stings, and was off, leaving me in greater distress than I cared to show. To say that I Avas stung to the quick by this rash plot against my slumbers, is a feeble way of expressing my feelings. John \u2014 Uncle John! \u2014 I had believed this boy kindly, honourable, frank ; and now he proved himself to be no better than the rest of them. No better, forsooth ! when Avas it otherwise than portentous that public schoolboys should play such irreverent pranks upon their masters ? It was bad enough to find any boy Avilling so to annoy me, but this boy of all others ! I had treated him with unreserved friendliness, yet he could make himself the tool of a petty spite like this. I must indeed be hated in the school if my own uncle thus turned against me ! The prickly point of the jest was plain enough. I happen to belong by race and name to \" Caledonia, stern and wild,\" and though, born beyond the sea and brought up at an English school and university, as a matter of fact, I have not spent one-tenth of my life in that part of the kingdom, I am rather proud than otherwise \u2014 as who would not be? \u2014 of"], [143, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 131 my Scotch descent, Avhich, however, to some in considerate minds presents itself as a handle of reproach. Therefore, as I had become aAvare \u2014 never mind hoAv \u2014 some of my irreverent pupils were in the way of nicknaming me \" Scotchie,\" rather, I fear, as a term of opprobrium than of endearment. Hence these thistles ! But that my kinsman should have undertaken to administer such a sharp hint of disapproval ! \u2014 this Avas the most unkindest cut of all. And now what action must I take? If I quietly put up Avith these thistles, should I not be Avritten down an ass ? What is the motto of the thistle, if not Nemo me impune lacessit! It would never do to pass over such an audacious attempt, else there would be \"an end to all discipline,\" as our head master was fond of saying ; yet how could I deal with it? It was undoubtedly deserving of the severest punishment, Avhich the Warden would not be backward in inflicting ; but would it be becoming in me to consign my uncle to the hands of the executioner ? It seemed to savour of parricide. In spite of my real and serious concern, these humorous whims touching our relationship would come to mingle with my troubled thoughts. Uncles might be unkind \u2014 they often were, from the days of the Babes in the Wood downwards \u2014 but who ever heard in tale or history of a cruel and revengeful nephew ? Did it not beseem a younger scion of the family rather to conceal and make excuse for the frailties of one who, in a sense, must be numbered among his ancestors?"], [144, ".A Schoolmaster's Stories. 132 Still, I had to remember that I was a master before a kinsman. Blood is thicker than Avater, but duty has stricter ties than blood. I must play the Roman nephew. If Brutus shrank not from seeing his own sons scourged before those stern eyes, should I shield my unnatural uncle from the stripes that ought rather to be dealt to him in double measure ? But \" oh cruel spite ! \" that this ruthless necessity Avas laid upon me. How could I ever look him in the face again \u2014 nay, rather, how could he look me in the face for many a day to come ? Some future day, Avhen he grew old enough to appreciate the ties of kindred, he might bitterly repent of this night's Avork, knowing for himself perhaps how much more sharp than prick of thistle or smart of birch it is to have a thankless uncle ! When I Avent to bed, having first taken care to see that my sheets Avere free from all insidious danger, a line of Shakespeare kept running in my head, after a favourite trick of that wilful mind of mine, and I murmured to myself over and over again \u2014 \" Oh, John, John, how was I mistook in you ! \" At the same time I could not help thinking that his pillow that night would be no easy one, and how the burden of his alarmed thoughts must be \u2014 \" to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow ! \""], [145, "The Nephezv and the Uncle. 133 III. HOURS and hours that night I lay miserably restless, and could not cease imagining that a thistle or two still remained at the bottom of the bed. On examination, there appeared nothing but a little down ; yet it Avas no couch of down on Avhich I tossed uneasily. John Ferrier, a pre cocious Macbeth, had murdered sleep for me. How have sovereigns felt Avhen their own near kinsmen were convicted of high treason ? I Avas given up to a long string of feverish fancies, in the course of Avhich one parallel presented itself after another between my case and that of celebrated characters in history and fiction. I could quite enter into the feelings of Queen Elizabeth, so incensed against her relative Mary of Scots, yet so reluctant, as some say, to sign the warrant for her execution. I thought grimly of Henry VIII., and his dealings Avith his family. Now was I Tullia mangling the body of her parent ; noAV a resentful Arthur, not quite sure Avhat part to play towards his John; now Richard Crookback stifling his nephews \u2014 ha ! ha ! his uncles \u2014 in the ToAver. False, fleeting, perjured Ferrier! Or I was Hamlet, King of Denmark, and this villainous uncle came stealing \"upon my secure hour\" with that baneful herb of his \u2014 \" Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing ; Confederate season, else no creature seeing : Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected, With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected ! \""], [146, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 134 Again, I was Lord William, listening to young Edmund's helpless screams; or was it Edmund Avho turned a deaf ear to poor William's entreaties? In my excited state of mind these historical re miniscences became a little confused. Then John appeared before me as Guy Fawkes, laying a train of thistles to blow me sky-high. Next it was Valentine, setting out in full armour, but with a drawn birch-rod in his hand, against his brother Orson. By this time, as you may suppose, I was at last sinking into an uneasy doze, throughout A\\'hich, in painful nightmare visions, I seemed to be froAvning like some black-broAved tragedian, and exclaiming, hoarsely, with a stamp of my foot, \" Hoff with 'is 'ead ; so much for Uncle John ! \" From such slumber I arose unrefreshed, and still uncertain how to act. My hand shook while shaving; if I myself had been going to execution I think I should have been calmer. Was there no Avay of reconciling the claims of kindred and those of my insulted office ? I waited in my room, both before and after breakfast, hopeful that Uncle John would come to explain, to apologise, to implore pardon, as well he might. I would have turned no deaf ear to his remorse for that \" biting jest\" of his; at this stage of the affair it Avas not too late for him out of the thistle danger to pluck the down of safety. I was ready to jump at the slightest figment of excuse, so far as punishment went, though our friendship, I felt sure, could never be on the same footing as before. Might he not"], [147, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 135 at least plead that he Avas forced to it by his companions, that his \" heart Avas not confederate with his hand \" ? But he came not, nor as I Avent to chapel could I see him lingering about on the chance of my accosting him. At least he seemed not insensible to shame. This after all might be considered a redeeming point in him. Had it not been for this, I could have had no choice but to disown him for my uncle. Or was it pride that held him back from abasing himself? He had shot his bolt like a man, and now that it had failed, with folded arms and steady look he stood awaiting the fire of the enemy Avho had him in his power, scorning to descend to entreaties or unmanly marks of fear. That Avere like what I had believed of him. \" Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes, And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice ! \" When nine o'clock school drew near, and he made no sign, I took my resolution. Steeling my heart, I went to the Warden, and told him all. As I expected, my story aroused his warm indignation; but what seemed to shock him was rather the fact of such an insult being offered to \" one of his masters\" than that of the unkindness done to a kinsman. His clear and peremptory intellect at once pronounced on the steps to be taken. \"There would be an end of all discipline,\" he said, \" if such a case Avere to be passed over with impunity. I shall not require you to be present, as it might be unpleasant to you, considering the"], [148, "136 A Schoolmaster's Stories. circumstances. But you may depend upon my making a severe example of this ill-conditioned young friend of yours. Leave him in my hands.\" As in relationship bound, I said a few words of recommendation to mercy; but they were Avasted on our Rhadamanthus, who, being as usual very busy, politely put an end to my audience ; and I went into school, abandoning my traitorous uncle to his fate. All forenoon I continued quite unhappy over it, and I fear the instruction Avhich I gave to my form was not as lucid and profitable as it should have been. They must have seen that there was a cloud on my brow ; and I saw, or thought I saw them regarding me with special interest, as if aAvare of the trick played on me, and curious to know how I might have taken it. The mellifluous wisdom of the Public School Primer, and the quaint fancy of Henry's Latin Exercises, were a more than ordinary weariness of the flesh to us all that morning. But oh! if this were so, what ominous forebodings must have been crowding into my uncle's mind, and darkening there all the philosophy of the classic sages ! At twelve o'clock the Avhole school assembled in the large schoolroom, Avhere it Avas the custom for the head boy to read out the names of those con demned to punishment \u2014 so many entered in the detention-book, so many confined to gates, such and such an one to wait for the Warden \u2014 a signifi cant euphemism, implying for him thus marked out a most unpleasant interview, the result of"], [149, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 137 which would long tingle upon the warning records of his memory. In this black list there Avas now but one name \u2014 John Ferrier. The announcement of it caused no little sensation among those who knew him. How had he, of all fellows, got into a scrape of such deep dye ? Many an eye of surprise turned towards the desk Avhere he sat with downcast looks, already perhaps Avriggling on his seat in lively anticipation of Avhat was to come. For my part, after a single furtive glance at the unmasked hypocrite, I turned away my head like a tender hearted Inquisitor, unwilling to gloat over the sufferings of one whom he has delivered over to be \" tenderly \" dealt Avith by the secular arm. \" It must be \u2014 and yet it moves me, Romans!\" The boys having been dismissed, I Avent to my OAvn room, Avhere I vainly tried to occupy my thoughts in correcting some exercises. I could think of nothing but that more serious correction Avhich must by this time be in hand on the other side of the quadrangle. \" He is about it ! \" as Lady Macbeth said. My uncle Avould long ago have arrived at the place of execution. Had the Warden finished that exordium with Avhich, in such grave cases, he Avas wont to preface his proceedings ? In my mind's eye, I saw the instrument brandished over the prostrate form. Was he bearing it like a man \u2014 like a scion of my house ? What was he thinking of me at that moment ? How did his own unnatural behaviour look to him now? Would this Avell-merited chastisement harden or"], [150, "138 A Schoolmaster's Stories. soften his heart ? What Avould his mother say if he should be driven to bad courses by the relentless severity of his nephew ? If such evil came of it, the pricking of those thistles would be nothing to the pricking of my conscience. Suddenly came a loud knocking at the door, Avhich opened before I could answer, and there entered in haste some half a dozen boys. At a glance I saw they all belonged to that set I had punished the day before. At their head, as leader and spokesman of the deputation, marched Toby, with a formidable scowl upon his face, who breath lessly, and by no means respectfully, entered upon his business. \" Is it true you have sent up Ferrier ? \" he barked out, with a jerk of his head in the direction of the Chamber of Horrors. Yes,\" I admitted, taken somewhat aback. \" For what happened last night in your bedroom, I mean ? \" \" What business is it of yours, may I ask ? \" said I, making an attempt to stand on my dignity, as became a Roman-minded kinsman. \" You are only Avasting time if you have come to speak to me in Ferrier's favour.\" \" It's everybody's business to see that nobody gets ill-used. It wasn't him that did something to your bed.\" \" Why, hoAV do you know ? \" \" Nobody knows if I don't,\" quoth Toby, Avith a defiant look that said as plainly as Avords, \" 'Tzvas L that did it!\""], [151, "The NepJiew and the Uncle. 139 \" Then there is some mistake,\" I faltered. \" I should rather think there Avas ! \" snorted Toby. \" I'll tell you all about it if there is no other way of getting out of the mess that has been made. I know this, that Ferrier stood out against the Avhole thing. I don't know, sir, what you and he said to each other last night, but I think he must have gone to take the thistles out of your bed because he Avas your uncle. And you send him to be swished for that ! \" The scales fell from my eyes, opened at once to the horrible injustice Avhich I had been doing. Like a white-faced Othello, I stood shame-struck to learn how far my hasty suspicions had misled me, and how this indignant Toby might well be bold as my accuser. After all, \" it is a peerless kinsman ! \" \" Why did he not tell me \u2014 why not explain ? \" \" You Avouldn't have had him tell on us ? \" ex claimed Toby, with a scorn before Avhich I quailed, master as I was. This dog-faced fellow seemed master of the situation ; I stood silent, feeling like the Irishman who would not open his mouth for fear of putting his foot in it. \" You see, sir,\" said another boy, Avho took a more moderate view of my error, \" if you caught him meddling with your bed, he couldn't have excused himself without giving you a pretty plain hint to bring some of us into trouble. And if he had told us what he Avas about, we might have set upon him for not standing by us. It was very hard for him to know what to do. Then perhaps"], [152, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 140 he thought he had better hold his tongue and take the blame of it, so that no one should have any excuse for calling him a sneak. Ferrier is just that sort of felloAv.\" My staunch, honourable, and fearless uncle ! \" Oh, if I had but known this sooner !\" I thought, and said something to that effect. \" Perhaps there may be time to set things right yet,\" suggested one of them. \" It isn't fair that Ferrier should be flogged, sir, when it was another fellow that did it.\" \" The fellow that did it doesn't Avant any one else to take his floggings for him ! \" cried Toby, glaring on me like a Cerberus. But I waited not to hear another word. Goaded into action by my own feelings, no less than by such reproaches, I sprang out of the room and fleAV capless across the quadrangle, Avith my gown streaming in the wind, to the great amazement of sundry small boys, who stopped playing fives to stare after me. Others started out of my way as if I had been a Malay running amuck. Hope and anxiety lent speed to my legs \u2014 the faint hope that I might even yet be able to rescue this prisoner, so rashly convicted on circumstantial evidence, from the doom to Avhich I had so unworthily consigned him. Alas ! the chances were that the deed had been done. Five minutes ago, if the machinery of the law had Avorked Avith its ordinary smoothness, my poor uncle's sufferings must have been over ; and now his breast would be rankling with the far more burning sense of a scandalous injustice"], [153, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 141 wrought upon him, and through that very nephew Avho should have been his champion and protector. It was my turn to be on the rack. On ! on ! there might still be time, and never did king's messenger, spurring madly along Avith a tardy reprieve, ride his last stage as I ran, if possible to stay the arm of that too punctual executioner. It hardly took me two minutes to bound across the quadrangle ; and during that Avild course of mine, let me invite the reader to an explanatory digression, for Avhich I can plead Shakespeare's example in the description whereby he chooses to keep us in suspense when relating the circumstances of Ophelia's fate. The extreme penalty of the law at this school Avas administered Avith a certain solemnity that went far to carry off its more ridiculous aspects. Our Warden, you must know, Avas a man of dignity and presence \u2014 a Doctor of Divinity, who had been a rector and hoped to be a dean \u2014 comely and portly, Avith classic features and smooth-shaven face, looking like a genteel ancient philosopher, or a Roman senator in cap and gown. Such a personage, though he strongly upheld the time honoured birch, pronouncing that Avithout it there \" would be an end of discipline,\" could not but be conscious that he did not appear to advantage in the act of castigating refractory youngsters, and to conceal the inherent absurdity of the performance made a point of being very particular about the ceremonies connected with it. He Avas wont to arrive on the scene in a processional manner,"], [154, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 142 accompanied by two Prefects as lictors, who intro duced each criminal with due forms, and performed certain almost indispensable duties for him in the moment of his agony. An acolyte, chosen from the boys of the lower school, usually attended for rendering minor services about the sufferer's person, and, according to immemorial usage, the brawny school porter was also bound to be in Avaiting to lend assistance if necessary, though to be forced to undergo the necessary manipulation at his hands Avould have been counted by most boys the depth of degradation. An assistant master, on Avhose complaint the operation might take place, Avas generally expected to be present, but the friends and sympathisers of him for Avhom all this parade was made were not allowed to approach the scene of torture beyond the threshold; the old rule, Omne ignotum pro magnifico, being held to apply in the case of the example afforded. One of the Prefects, taking it in turn day about, was responsible for these accessories being duly provided. I reached the fatal door. I rushed in boldly, yet dreading to see what there might meet my eyes. No ! \u2014 it Avas over then ? The only person in the room was the Warden, who stood with his back to the fireplace, looking very stiff and awkAvard, as one who had just been discharging a disagreeable duty, or as \u2014 but Avithout Avaiting to think, I burst out \u2014 \" Has Ferrier been \u2014 ? \" \" I am expecting him every moment,\" said the"], [155, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 143 Warden, twitching his gown impatiently; and what a breath of relief did I draw ! Then it was not too late! In the tone of a man Avho had just cause of dis pleasure in being delayed over such a task, he gave me some hint of the cause of this delay. Of all the Prefects it had luckily rested on Mason, that morning, to make arrangements for the execution, and he, in one of his frequent fits of Avool-gathering, must have forgotten all about it. Consequently, Avhen the judge and the victim had duly appeared upon the scene, the other assistants Avere not forth coming. In their absence, it seemed impossible for our Chief, such a stickler for decorous forms, to exercise his painful functions properly ; so my innocent uncle, after being kept on the tenter hooks of suspense for several minutes, and having undergone Avithout a word a scathing admonition of unusual length, was at last sent on the errand of providing sauce for his own basting. In other Avords, he had to find the two Prefects required to attend him on the scaffold, to Avhom he must say for himself, like Buckingham, \" Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame ! \" And noAV, looking out of the Avindow, I saw him approaching between the two myrmidons of justice, like a young Eugene Aram, or like Lady Jane Grey in jacket and trousers \u2014 like Regulus, rather, in the hands of the cruel Carthaginians, or like Count Egmont, guilty alone of having served his master too well. But out on these conceits ! I hurriedly explained to the Warden that it Avas reward rather"], [156, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 144 than punishment that Avas \"in order,\" as our American friends say. Then, when this young hero Avas manning himself to confront the stern faces of the Eumenides grouped around the grue some apparatus of justice, he Avas met at the door by me, his nephew, who could hardly forbear crying, \" Come to my arms \u2014 my uncle ! \" IV. Am I not right in calling John Ferrier the hero of my story ? I feel hardly fit for a hero myself, being too short of stature, too thin-skinned and weak-kneed in resolution, too fidgety, too apt to say and do the wrong thing Avith all the will in the world to light upon the right one, and, Avithal, too conscious of my own shortcomings to meet the rubs of life with heroic dignity and self-possession; in short, a person of such a nervous temperament as was not ill hit off by one of my pupils, who, I understand, described me as \" one of those fellows Avho are always on their hind legs.\" I am not Avriting to bespeak admiration for myself, though I trust a little sympathy will not be denied me ; but I have undertaken to tell the Avhole truth, and the truth is that my Uncle John had shown himself an uncle indeed, and nothine less than a hero in his small way. But I must get on with my narrative, leaving the reader to point the moral for himself. You may readily suppose"], [157, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 145 the explanation that passed between John and me. I was fain to address him extravagantly in some such language as that used by Duncan to the undeserving Macbeth \u2014 The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me : Thou art so far before, That swiftest wing of recompense is slow To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved, That the proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been mine ! \" He for his part Avas for making light of the whole affair, in Avhich all appeared so much to his credit. \" And you knew quite Avell Avho really did it ? \" \" I Avould rather not say. Please don't ask me any more about it,\" he answered, awkwardly. \" I am not going to ask you. You don't suppose I should have forced you to betray your companions, even if you had told me Avhat you were doing ? My dear fellow, you might have thought how uncom fortable it Avould make me to find out that I had got you into such a bad scrape Avithout in the least deserving it. And I should have found out sooner or later. You might surely depend on Toby, or whoever it was, speaking out like a man, Avhen he found the blame laid on you.\" \" Well, then they Avould have been sure to say that I had been sneaking on them. I wish I had known nothing about it, and there's no good saying anything more.\" \" I wish so too, for you would certainly have been flogged ten minutes ago if this lucky chance had not come in the way.\" 1:"], [158, "146 A Schoolmaster's Stories. \" That's no matter. You know I have never been swished at school before,\" quoth John, trying to laugh it off. \" That makes it all the worse.\" \" No ; it would have been an experience\" said he, like a good fellow that he Avas, doing his best to set my mind at ease ; but all the same I guessed that he Avas much relieved at the turn things had taken. \" Well, I tell you what \u2014 the next time you get into trouble I will let you off, in consideration of the fright you have had in taking your nepheAv's part.\" \" Oh no, sir, that would never do ! \" he exclaimed, and I saw the justness and delicacy of his objection. Like C\u00e6sar's Avife, my uncle must be above all suspicion of special indulgence at my hands. He now left me, for after his interrupted inter view Avith the Warden he had to keep a pressing engagement in the detention-room, Avhich he owed probably, poor fellow, to some fit of inattention to his lessons, pardonable enough that morning, under the circumstances. And at no time afterwards could I get him to talk about this business without unwillingness and constraint, as if he were ashamed of having acted so finely. For my part, I could hardly restrain my admira tion. The dejection which possessed me the night before had passed aAvay like a fit of toothache, leaving instead a feeling, not only of relief, but of positive elation. Uncle John had silently taught me an inspiring lesson. I no longer took a gloomy"], [159, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 147 view of my Avork; his conduct had reconciled me to the whole race of boys. In my haste I had called them all obstinate, malicious, insensible to right influences. Now I Avondered Avhy their masters do not try more to bring out the good that is in them, instead of being so much taken up Avith repressing the carelessnesses and thoughtless nesses and petty naughtinesses Avith which they so often vex our critical souls. Often, as in this case, I have made up my mind never to think ill of boys again, nor did I \u2014 till the next time that they worried me beyond bearing. In my present frame of mind, I felt magnani mous even towards Toby, the fount and origin of all this mischief. Yet it behoved me to take him to task about Avhat he had meant to do ; for, as our Chief said, there would be an end of all discipline if such doings Avere to be winked at. So I sent for the young rebel. I have since learned that, after our last interview, he betook himself to his desk, and Avith characteristic vehemence set to scratching out the name of Scotland wherever he could find it in his lesson books, as a testimony of his indignation against me. That Avas the good side in him \u2014 his sympathy Avith John's unmerited sufferings, even though it took the questionable form of antipathy to one who, after all, Avas not the prime cause of them. He appeared before me Avith a dogged look, which I often noticed him put on when he had made up his mind that there was nothing to be said for himself. In this case he had donned his"], [160, "148 A Schoolmaster's Stories. armour of obdurateness to small purpose, since I had no desire to be hard on him. I must be round with him; I Avould set him up a glass wherein he might see his faultiness; yet Avould I deal with him in sorroAv rather than in anger, and would speak daggers but use none. \" I suppose I may take it that I have you to thank for what happened last night ? \" I began ; and looking me boldly in the face, he said, \" We have been talking over it, and don't want to make any more trouble. There were several of us who had a hand in it, but I was the one Avho put them in your bed. I take the blame.\" Having made this confession in the tone of one uttering a boast, rather, he shut his lips tight, as if to say, \" There, make the best of that ; you'll get no more from me.\" \"And do you think it right to play such tricks ? \" Like other orators, I paused for a reply, but there was none. \" What good could possibly come of it to you or anybody ? \" Toby stiffened himself on one leg, and stood resolutely silent. \" Is it such a satisfaction to you, then, to annoy me ? \" He shifted his Aveight to the other leg. \" For of course you hoped to annoy me ; but did you think the chance of doing this worth the risk of severe punishment ? \" Not a word."], [161, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 149 \" You must surely have considered hoAv likely you were to be found out ? \" Toby offered no remark ; but his attitude might be considered as expressive of something like this: \" You have found me out, and it is your turn now.\" \" Or, as has very nearly happened, you might have got another fellow into a bad scrape.\" Ha ! I had touched him nearly. He raised his head and sniffed. \"It Avas a foolish thing to do,\" I Avent on, after a pause. \" You ought to have known that such coarse jokes are not the fashion nowadays for public schoolboys to play on their masters.\" I thought he was going to speak, but he only fixed his eyes steadily on the ceiling. It was someAvhat embarrassing for me ; if he Avould afford me no answers to take hold of, how could I keep up this Socratic process of reasoning, by Avhich I was endeavouring to bring conviction home to him ? My lecture was burning itself out for Avant of fuel from his side. \" Well, I am going to say no more about it, though you must know you richly deserve to be punished.\" At this Toby stared. \" I can only tell you that I had far rather your trick had succeeded than that this mistake should have been made. And some day I hope you will have sense enough to feel sorry for causing so much mischief.\" I thought he Avas going to speak now, but he"], [162, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 150 didn't. I gave him a few more words of serious talk, then dismissed him, as it seemed, sullen and impenitent. But when he had been gone three or four minutes he suddenly reappeared, standing half in and half out of the room, and let me understand that he had a communication to make. \" I Avon't do it again, sir,\" he said, bluntly. \" I hope not,\" said I, hardly able to keep from smiling at the condescending air Avith which he seemed to offer me this assurance. Then he took himself off; and I felt as well satisfied Avith such a pledge of his good behaviour as if I had handed him over to the utmost rigour of justice. But after all, my tale is to end in a tragedy. I am not the first person Avho has put the machinery of the law in motion Avithout being able to arrest it at will. The Warden, to whom it behoved me to explain the Avhole affair, was by no means ready to take my merciful view of Toby's conduct. \" My dear sir,\" he said, \" there would be an end of every kind of discipline if such insubordination were to be left unnoticed. It is clearly my duty to make an example of this boy, and I beg you will say no more to me on the subject.\" When the Warden had thus made up his mind there might be no gainsaying him. So next day, at noon, the scaffold and the rods Avere again prepared, and the lictors in readiness, and in the striking scene, which this time did not fail to ensue, it was Toby that played the principal"], [163, "The Nephew and the Uncle. 151 part \u2014 not Avithout credit. It might be expected that such a boy Avould have protested and struggled like Mr Punch in the hands of Nemesis ; but this would be taking a shalloAV view of his character. Infected, perhaps, by John Ferrier's example, or seeing fate to be too strong for him, he resigned himself to it with as much cheerfulness as possible under the circumstances, and bore his punishment like a man. And, so far from revenging himself afterwards by posing as an ill-used person, he was even at some pains to make me aware that he magnanimously attached no blame to me for my share in what had happened. A few nights later, having naturally taken to the way of carefully examining my bed before trusting myself to it, I found lying between the sheets two apples, rather rotten than otherwise, and a small parcel of early straAvberries. On inquiry, I learned that Master Toby had received a hamper from his home in Cornwall, and understood this strangely offered present to be from him, which I rightly interpreted not so much as a bribe as an overture of reconciliation and goodwill, and for some time to come, indeed, there were fewer thistle-pricks than usual in our intercourse. As for John Ferrier, I need hardly say that Ave became greater friends than ever. Both among schoolfelloAvs and masters, when the Avhole truth came to be known, his conduct in this abortive plot gained him great credit, part of which was reflected on his nephew. It may have been that the approach of the holidays softened their manners"], [164, "152 A Schoolmaster's Stories. and did not suffer them to be so wild as usual, but I fancied that, for the rest of this term, the boys treated me with a certain increase of respect, and if so, could not but be conscious that I owed this to the supererogatory merits of my Uncle John."], [165, "TOBY. I. SlNG, O Muse ! or say, more fitly, in humble prose, the Avrath of Toby, which brought him into a woeful scrape, and had nearly ended in his school days being cut short untimely, Avhereby he might have gone to the dogs (if the will of our headmaster had been accomplished), all on account of a quarrel between Mr Brooks, the English master, and Toby, captain of the second eleven. You remember this \" Toby,\" the dog-faced, cross-grained fellow of whom I have already told you something, partly to his credit, partly other- Avise, such as is to be told about all of us. I could not then recall his real name, but since, I have looked it up in an old school list, and, at first sight, wondered how I could have forgotten it \u2014 Hill, of course! Thomas Oliver Brentwood Hill was his name, and impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis, acer was his nature. The misunderstanding be tween myself and my uncle, formerly related, was far from the only instance in which he caused 163"], [166, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 154 trouble to himself and to others through his unpleasant temper. A year or two have passed since then, but Toby seems to take as much delight as ever in barking and biting. For the rest, he has shot up into a tall, sturdy youth, is now in the fifth form, and has just been chosen captain of the second eleven, an honour, in our community, more than equal to knighthood, seeing that on the earliest vacancy he would stand the best chance of being raised to the peerage of the first eleven, an object of ambition bulking larger in the eyes of schoolboys than any Lord Mayoralty or Grand Mogulship in the world. He had his good qualities, you see ; with all his surliness, there was something in him which one could not help liking when one got to know him, so that he made friends as well as enemies ; and he certainly never shoAved to such advantage as Avhen putting all the crabbed vehemence of his disposition into a good vicious swipe at a full-pitched ball. These things being so, it befell that one morning, at second school, when he ought to have been doing Greek prose Avith all his might and main, my hero was found by the master of his form engaged with a yellow-covered volume, that looked not even so business-like as a Tauchnitz edition of the classics. On being challenged as to this, Toby, scorning equivocation, was fain to admit that his studies had for the nonce taken the direction of Fenimore Cooper's works. His wilful wits, weary of dictionary and grammar, had"], [167, "Toby. 155 been making a surreptitious excursion to the bound less prairie and the primeval forest. This was the acorn of misdoing from which grew up the whole forest of troubles we are about to enter upon. \"So!\" said the master. \"I suppose, Hill, you have been making a comparison between the manners and customs of the Red Indians and those of the ancient Scythians, as described in the classical Avriters !

Therefore \u2014 being, moreover, clearly in the wrong of it \u2014 our hero had for once not another word to say for himself, but sat silently and sullenly submissive, Avith an ugly look upon his bull-dog countenance.

According to his own view of the matter, he was continually being ill-used by some or other of the masters, not considering that, in nine cases out of ten \u2014 or shall we say ninety-nine out of a hundred ? \u2014 \" The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars But in ourselves,\" when we get out of gear Avith those who are set over us to keep our blunt edges close to the grindstone of duty.

At twelve o'clock, then, willy-nilly, our hero presented himself in the room where culprits were confined under the superintendence of one of the junior masters, taking this unpopular duty in turns. And that day the presiding genius of the detention-room Avas a master who must now be introduced to the reader by the name of Mr Brooks, though, poor man ! he has for years been beyond the possibility of introducing anyone to him. Mr Brooks, if you please, was a neat, prim, formal"], [169, "Toby 157 little old man, with close-trimmed grey Avhiskers and high shirt-collars, a deposit from an older scholastic stratum, presenting a marked contrast to the new-fangled ways of most of his colleagues. He had held from time immemorial Avhat Avas called the \" English \" mastership, setting sums and so forth to the youngest boys of the \" modern \" school, keeping accounts and lists, making himself generally useful \u2014 in short, a kind of scholastic Gibeonite or master-of-all-work. My experience leads me to think that to teach small minds rightly takes a cleverer man than in the case of big ones ; and at most good schools it is now beginning to be recognised that the teaching of English is not to be handed over to any erste beste adult as a matter of the least consequence. In those days, however, it was thought otherwise at such schools as ours. The English master ranked among us as a non-commissioned officer, so to speak, not being a university man, Avearing no cap and gown, Avielding a someAvhat limp thunderbolt against the wayAvard ness of those set under him. In the eyes of the very smallest form, indeed, he might be a great man, but most of the boys, who came in contact Avith him mainly in the petty details of serving out books and stationery and so forth, were apt to look upon him much as the purser of a man-of-war seems to have been regarded among Captain Marryat's midshipmen. It Avas fine to see the condescending manner of the head of the sixth form towards this septuagenarian, nominally his official superior. Then, if ever, you might recognise the dignified"], [170, "158 A Schoolmaster's Stories. affability of true greatness ! As for us other masters, especially the smart young gentlemen fresh from the universities, we were rather inclined to treat Mr Brooks Avith more politeness than cordiality, and to speak of him behind his back in the \" forsooth, a great arithmetician ! \" tone. Most of us, from the height of our superiority, chuckled over mischievous tales about him. As, for instance, this, handed down by tradition of a certain lofty minded Warden of a past generation, who left his mark on the school in more Avays than one. \" Am I to wear a gown, if you please, Dr ?\" Mr Brooks is said to have asked him. \" That's as you please, Mr Brooks,\" Avas the dignitary's suave reply. \" Are the boys to touch their hats to me, Dr ?\" \" That's as they please, Mr Brooks. The best of it was that Mr Brooks had a son who got a scholarship at the university, beat some of us hollow on our OAvn ground, and became fellow and tutor of his college. A most offensive, conceited prig he Avas, to tell the truth, and, if all stories may be trusted, shoAved himself rather ashamed of his old father. But it is hardly to be Avondered at if our English master Avas not a little proud of his successful son, frequently talking about him to us, as if thus presenting a claim to some reflection of respect on himself. One year this prodigy came to us as examiner, and wasn't Mr Brooks cock-a hoop !

The more considerate among us, however, had a kindly feeling to Mr Brooks for his OAvn sake. He had been English master at that school before most of the other masters were born. Like Nestor, he had seen generation after generation of them pass away, not to speak of pupils. \" Boys may come, and boys may go, But I go on for ever.\" So said of him one of us who has a foolish itch for such playing with the words of great writers. We took a certain pride in him as a venerable institu tion of the school, a living chronicle of its traditions. When he died in harness, a few years later, he had held his post for half a century all but tAvo years, and could tell of bishops, judges, cabinet ministers, who, short as he was, had once looked up to him. And, indeed, Ave might Avell have a genuine respect for him as a Avorthy man, who, all these years, had tried hard to do his duty under circumstances of"], [172, "160 A Schoolmaster's Stories. some difficulty, and did it on the Avhole Avith credit, though he might drop an h or so noAv and then. Once a year, on Speech Day, if the chairman were an old boy, which of course he nearly ahvays was, he would never fail to take occasion of alluding to the \" long and valuable services of one to whom we all owe so much, and who had become peculiarly identified with,\" etc., etc. Then there Avould be a tremendous outburst of applause, and all eyes would turn towards the old grey head, bowed down with becoming modesty, and filled, no doubt, Avith the strange mingled memories recalled by these recurring ovations. This was Mr Brooks's annual triumph ; at other times he had little enough need of an admonishing Avhisper in the ear of pride. \" His position required great tact,\" as our present Warden used to put it, in his delicate Avay. Now we return to a more stirring act of our story. Ring the bell, draw up the curtain, and discover Toby and his comrades in the dungeon \u2014 that is, the detention-room. Mr Brooks, in the part of gaoler, is sitting at the desk, doing his best to keep order on the silent system. Slow music is supplied by a constant succession of stifled yaAvns, shuffling of feet, creaking of forms, shutting of lids, rustling of paper, and so forth. Through the open windows come more cheerful sounds of footsteps hurrying over the gravelled court, and the unrestrained voices of boys Avho are not kept in this fine forenoon. It was a very unequal punishment, that of"], [173, "Toby. 161 detention, depending a good deal on the Aveather for one thing. Then some masters who sent their boys to detention made a point of giving them tasks to do, while others left them to find employ ment for, their own idle hands. If a large number were detained, the master in charge found it hard work keeping them all in order and out of mischief; and some masters again Avere stricter in this duty than others. I think I may mention, to my own credit, that I seldom kept any of my form in Avithout staying in Avith them, which was an adAantage to the boys in more than one Avay, though rather a tax upon myself. It is easy to say, \"An hour's detention, So-and-So!\" but not so easy to stay and see that Master So-and-So really does put his shoulder to the wheel that has been sticking in the mud. Luckily for Mr Brooks, this day, there Avere not many culprits to be looked after, and, more luckily, Toby had the Avhimsical task set him by his own master to attend to. He was the only big fellow there \u2014 a Gulliver among naughty Liliputians ; all the others were loAver-school boys and such like. It was, of course, the seniors of Avhom Mr Brooks felt rather afraid. Some of them had a way of playing impudent tricks, such as asking him Avith mock deference to help them over knotty points in their Greek and Latin, knowing Avell, the young rascals, that it Avas all Greek to him. And, sure enough, Toby had hardly settled down to his translation of Fenimore Cooper before he heaved his long legs over the form, with a good deal of L"], [174, "162 A Schoolmaster's Stories. unnecessary clatter, and approached the desk to ask a question. \" Please, sir, how am I to put this in Greek ? ' The Potawattomies and the Lroquois have smoked the pipe of peace and buried the tomahawk '.\" \" You must ask your own master these things,\" said Mr Brooks, half suspicious that he Avas being made fun of. \" Well, he has given me this to translate, and here's ever so many words that aren't in my dictionary \u2014 wampum, beaver, chawed-up, rattle snake, skunk, ramrod. How's a fellow to know \u2014 ?\" \" Go to your seat,\" commanded Mr Brooks, and back slouched Toby with much deliberation, as who should call on the spectators to observe how little he cared for this master. For a time now our friend was kept tolerably quiet, turning his Red Indian's tobacco and toma hawk into the best Greek he could. But when he had done this task so as to pass muster, he found himself at liberty to give Mr Brooks a little trouble. He set to reading his novel, leaning back against the wall, and holding up its yellow cover in an ostentatious manner, that the master might take notice of it, Avhich he presently did. \" Come, come,\" he said ; \"you Averen't sent here to read novels.\" \" Yes, I was, sir. \"What !\" exclaimed Mr Brooks, bristling up at Avhat he naturally took for a piece of mere impudence. \" Well, Mr Rolland gave me something to do"], [175, "Toby. 163 out of this book. You can ask him if you don't believe me.\" \" I am sure Mr Rolland didn't tell you to loll about in that lazy way. Do your work properly, if you have any to do, and put that book out of my sight.\" Toby, having got all that he wanted, laid down the book with an air of injured innocence, and addressed himself to turning up the collar of his jacket and looking round at the window which Mr Brooks had just ordered to be opened behind him, as if he felt a strong draught from it \u2014 he who cared nothing for as many draughts as would give a troop of elephants colds in their heads ! Presently he was loudly whispering to his neighbour at the next desk. \" Silence, please ! \" begged Mr Brooks, anxious to get on as smoothly as possible. At this command Toby demonstratively buried his head in his hands, but was soon whispering again and jerking drops of ink out of a pen towards a temptingly clean collar which, fortunately for itself, was just a yard or so out of his range. Mr Brooks fixed a half-rebuking, half-imploring eye on these doings, and Toby had the grace to leave off for the moment, till he hit upon some neAV means of making himself objectionable. If I were to tell you all that passed in that hour, you would accuse me of trying to make you realise the tediousness of detention ; everybody who knows what public-school discipline is can imagine plenty of ways in which a bold, impudent boy might"], [176, "164 A Schoolmaster's Stories. contrive to Avorry a master without exactly defying him. Toby, you see, not feeling himself free to make much display of his ill-humour before Mr Rolland, was minded to vent some of it upon the English master, who, for his part, though more than suspecting some such design, laid himself out to avoid any collision. He was at a loss what could be the matter now with this queer boy, but knew enough of him to have no wish to handle such a thorny subject any more than he could help. Indeed, he was not the only master who thought twice before tackling Toby. The clock crept on, so slowly; but at last the hand touched one, whereupon Toby jumped up Avith a howl of relief, and was making for the door. The other fellows staring at such free-and-easy demeanour, Mr Brooks felt that he must really play the man and master, or be put to open shame before all these small boys. \" What is the meaning of this noise ? Come here, sir ! \" he cried, descending from his desk and taking three steps towards the truant. Toby lounged back and stood jauntily before him with his hands in his pockets, half a head taller than little Mr Brooks, who found it so much the more difficult to stand on his dignity, and had recourse again to the policy of conciliation. \"Toby\" he said, in a jovial tone of remonstrance such as he had seen used with effect by younger masters. \" My name is Hill, if you are speaking to me,\" ansAvered the boy, gruffly."], [177, "Toby. 165 Well, Hill, where are you going to ? \" Out,\" quoth Toby. \" Time's up.\" \" Nothing of the kind ; that clock is more than five minutes fast. Anyhow, it is for me and not for you to say when detention is over, is it not ? \" Toby offered no opinion, and Mr Brooks took courage to assert himself further. \" I think you are trying how far you can go. I can't allow this sort of conduct. You must write me a hundred lines of Latin, please, and now go to your seat and be quiet.\" There was a scowl on Toby's face, but with an affectation of utter indifference he sat down on the nearest form, Avhere he proceeded to go through a pantomime of looking at his watch, comparing it with the clock, and telegraphing to the other boys to do likewise, all Avhich Mr Brooks saw, and pre tended not to see. In a minute or two he gave the welcome order of release ; then, Avhen all the rest hurried out, Toby sat to the last, and leisurely strolled forth, as if he had only been spending an idle hour for his own amusement. A good deal of chaff Avent on among his cronies when it \" transpired,\" as they say in the newspapers, that the captain of the second eleven had got an imposition from the English master. \" What was it for, Toby ? Were you not making your hair strokes light and your body strokes heavy ? Or was it for mistakes in the multiplica tion table ? \" \" Ask no questions and you'll be told no lies.\" \" His haughty spirit brooks not such control !\""], [178, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 166 It was Goodfellow, the wit of the fifth form, who thus kept tormenting him. \" Don't you make a greater ass of yourself than you are already,\" rejoined Toby, who was neither witty himself nor liked being the cause of wit in others. \" Poor Toby, it is a shame ! Shall I help you to read the lines first, in case there should be any hard words in them ? \" persisted his persecutor. \" What will you bet I don't do them ? \" \" ' I never gamble,' as the dog said to the bull when it offered to toss him.\" \" Well, you'll see.\" \" To be or not to be. Toby, don't be dogged,\" laughed Goodfellow. They were the best friends in the world, but such are the endearments of schoolboy life. You may well ask how I came to know what passed among these boys, who were not likely to talk in this way before me. But all the scenes of this story have been so fully described to me by one who had every opportunity of being both before and behind them, that, Avith a little help of imagination, I am able to communicate to my readers nearly the Avhole action, beginning, middle, and end, of the epic narrative to be continued in my next."], [179, "Toby. 167 II. TAVO or three days passed, during which Mr Brooks saw nothing of Toby's imposition. At last he sent a lower-school boy to jog his memory about it. By the hands of the same messenger Toby sent back a very skimpy and crumpled piece of paper, adding thereto certain winged Avords, Avhich the little Mercury did not think needful to repeat to his employer. The master, hoAvever, declined to receive it in this Avay. He had been thinking over the matter, and considered it would not be doing his duty to submit to the obstinate humours of a fifth-form fellow. So once more the lower-school boy, not ill pleased to have to use his legs rather than his brains for a change, sped on an errand to Toby, whom he found in all his glory, busy unpacking the neAV bats and balls which had just come from London for the second eleven. \" You've got to bring it yourself. He says it is not respectful.\" \" You've got to get a clout on the head,\" snapped Toby, just as Antony Avas moved to Avreak his wrath on the emissary of C\u00e6sar. \" I am but as a guiltless messenger,\" the small boy might have protested, but he thought it more prudent to decamp Avithout another word, when once he had served the summons entrusted to him.

Thus, it was only after a considerable delay that Toby pre sented himself in the room where Mr Brooks was instructing the lowest form in the art of hand writing, in his opinion not the least important part of education. He himself Avrote a hand like copper-plate, whereas some boys of Toby's stamp rather inclined to agree with Tom Tulliver in rejoicing that they were not in danger of such mean accomplishments \u2014 conceited young donkeys ! \" Hill, Avhy have you not brought me your imposition before this ? \" \" Here it is,\" said Toby, shortly. \" Well, better late than never. Stop a bit though, till I look over it. Dear me \u2014 what a scrawl ! Can't you write better than this ? I can hardly read a word of it.\" \" It's Latin,\" said Toby, an impudent hint on his part that in the English master's case it could not be said, \" Latin was for him no more difficile, Than for a blackbird 'tis to whistle.1 \" It might just as Avell be Assyrian or Chaldee. I call it blots and scratches. This is not the way to Avrite an imposition \u2014 tut ! tut ! And surely there aren't a hundred lines here.\" Mr Brooks began carefully to count the lines, while Toby leant against a desk and looked about him as if much at his ease. He was \" playing to"], [181, "Toby. 169 the gallery,\" the small boys, of Avhom the more graceless were delighted to see their master thus bearded in his den. \" I thought so,\" said Mr Brooks, when he had finished his scrutiny. \" There are about a dozen lines short. You can't suppose that any of the other masters Avould take an imposition done like this.\" \" I don't know \u2014 they trust to my honour,\" quoth Toby. \" Your honour ! \" Well, I didn't count the lines,\" said Toby, sulkily, quailing a little. Mr Brooks deliberately tore up the paper, then said, in a firm tone, for which he had been nerving himself during the last tAvo or three minutes, \" I am sorry to see, Hill, that you are trying to set my authority at nought, but you are much mistaken if you think to gain anything by this foolish conduct. You will write me two hundred lines ; you will do them neatly, and you will bring them to me yourself before lock-up this evening. Do you understand ? \" \" Yes, I understand,\" replied Toby, doggedly. \" Now you may go,\" said Mr Brooks, looking up at the big boy with all the commandingness he could throw into his eye. For a moment they stared at each other ; it was like a sculptured group representing the contest of mind with matter. Then Toby turned on his heel and stalked out, defiant to the last, slamming the door"], [182, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 170 behind him, as a knight of old might batter a challenge on the shield at his foeman's gate. You may imagine how the injured innocent now brooded over his wrongs. To Goodfellow, who sat next him at dinner, he confided the story of his unjust imposition, as he chose to consider it. \" And I suppose you told him you were not going to be imposed upon,\" said Goodfellow ; but, seeing his friend to be in no mood for jesting, he gave him a bit of sensible advice. \" Best do it and have done Avith it.\" \" Do you think I'm going to be bullied by a fellow like that ? \" \" Yes, Toby, you are as much to be pitied as the Irishman Avho killed his father and mother, then recommended himself to mercy as a poor orphan.\" \" You Avouldn't talk that way if you had been served so. I should like to see you catching it from Brooks.\" \" Perhaps not, but I don't care for fishing \u2014 I keep clear of rod and lines, and Brooks too. But if I had got myself hooked like you, I should be glad anyhow that it was such a wet day and there could be no cricket.\" This hint was lost upon Toby, who had a mind to amuse himself in another way than cricket that afternoon. A circus was exhibiting in the small town which gives its name to this school ; and our hero, being a keen amateur of all kinds of athletic feats, proposed to patronise the performance. So"], [183, "Toby. 171 he did, and here something occurred which did not help to smooth his ruffled feelings. The circus was crowded that Avet afternoon, a good many of our fellows clustering together on one part of the benches. Now these school boys, folloAving the example of their betters at Oxford and Cambridge, were rather in the Avay of despising the townspeople, and behaving on most public occasions as if nobody but themselves could be Avorth notice ; in fact, they were apt to assert their superior character by a display of rudeness and bumptiousness. At this circus it seems that some of them must needs make them selves unusually objectionable, pelting the per formers and the rest of the audience with peas, receiving the stale jokes of the clown with groans and hoots, attempting to distract the performing pony's attention, chaffing the \" Arab Courier of the Desert\" in his unparallelled feats of horseman ship, and even throAving out satirical allusions as to the Avaxed moustaches and gold-striped trousers of the haughty master of the ring. This silly conduct caused a good deal of indignation among the more sober part of the audience ; but their cries of \" Order ! order ! \" only acted on the young gentlemen as a challenge to further disorder. That is the worst of our public-school discipline; it secures a considerable degree of respect for its own authorities, at the price of too great want of that self-respect which produces becoming modesty and politeness to outsiders. Madame Something, \"the most daring equestri-"], [184, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 172 enne in the Avorld,\" all skirts and spangles, and breathless from bounding through half-a-dozen paper hoops, was resting gracefully upon her ambling piebald steed, while the usual comic interlude took place between the master of the ring and the painted lackadaisical scarecrow of a clown. \" Noav then, fool, will you help this young lady off 'er 'orse ? \" For answer, Mr Merriman stooped down and pretended to be groping for something in the saAvdust. \" Do you 'ear me, sir. What are you about there ? \" said the gold-laced dignitary, Avith a crack of his Avhip. \" Oh ! \" exclaimed the clown, in a melancholy whine, which Avas the chief point of his comicality. \" Please don't, sir. I was only looking for the h you dropped. You'll want to put it in somewhere presently.\" Loud laughter from the benches, and down went the clown again with his back to the boys, offering a tempting mark to one of them Avho happened to have a tennis ball handy. The ball flew into the arena, a sounding Avhack was heard, and the poor clown started up with an \" Oh ! \" in real earnest this time. This caused no little sensation, as you may suppose. There was a cry of \" Shame ! \" from one side and a loud laugh from the benches where the boys sat, but in a moment it was hushed, and everybody waited to hear what the clown would say or do. He had recovered his"], [185, "Toby. 173 self-possession, and facing round towards the assailant, remarked quietly and distinctly, \" One fool at a time, please ! \" At once from every part of the circle arose roars of laughter, inextinguishable as the mirth of Olympus over Vulcan's ungainly shamble. Every eye Avas turned upon the group of boys, among Avhom a face red as fire too clearly marked out the offender. It was Toby that, thinking to score off the poor clown, found himself so neatly bowled out by this man of motley, who was evidently not such a fool as he looked. Picking up the ball, he advanced as if to give it back, but when he came in front of Toby he suddenly snatched off his coxcomb, and made as if offering it to our discomfited hero, who, for his part, Avished himself in detention or anywhere, when he thus became the most prominent figure in this extempore performance. \" Will you take the fool's cap, sir ? \" said the cloAvn, with mock humility; then turning round, he appealed to the rest of the audience. \" Does it not fit him ? Ladies and gentlemen, two can play the fool, but some folks can't play so Avell as others. Englishmen always stand up for fair play, and you can judge who has got hold of the red-hot end of the poker.\" Never had any hit of his called forth louder applause, mingled with loud cries of \"Turn him out!\" \"Where's the police?\" and hisses directed against poor Toby, sitting shamefaced and helpless as if in the pillory, Avith even his own schoolfellows"], [186, "A Schoolmaster s Stories. 174 laughing at him. The band struck up, and the fair equestrienne resumed her Avild career, and the master of the ring cracked his Avhip vehemently in the design of diverting public attention ; but the disturbance went on for some minutes, several persons showing a desire to eject the originator of it by force, which might have led to a free fight. Indeed Toby could hardly be withheld from making at the clown, when he begged for silence, saying, \" Leave the young gentleman alone. Don't you see how frightened he is, poor little fellow ! He has his nursemaid to settle Avith for this.\" More guffaAvs, in which the excitement began to spend itself, and the audience to settle down again to their amusement. Toby braved it out a little longer, but presently took an opportunity, on the entrance of two elephants, to slip off with whatever air of lofty contempt he could command, pursued to the door by derisive cries from some who were not sorry to see one of these uppish young gentlemen get so decidedly the Avorst of his bumptiousness. Savage and sore as Bruin the bear when, having been caught in such a trap by Reynard the fox, he was drummed out of the parish, and narrowly escaped Avith part of his skin, even thus, smarting in mind, and his ears still tingling from the sounds of popular disapproval, Toby came back to the school, and betook himself to his fastness, the fifth form room, where no one as yet could be aware of his humiliation, or Avhere, at least, feAv"], [187, "Toby. 175 would venture to cast it in his face. But there he found the very person of all others Avhom he would rather not meet. The fifth form, especially those of them who had not come to have studies to sit in, used their room out of school hours as a sort of club, the entrance to which was someAvhat jealously guarded. They subscribed among themselves for several papers, and could boast of taking in more than one popular publication not to be found even in the masters' common room. Noav, that week there happened to appear in the Lllustrated London News a picture of the college of which our English master's son was a distinguished orna ment. Naturally Mr Brooks was interested in this illustration, and one of the fellows had civilly asked him to look at it ; else this Avas the last place Avhere one might have expected to encounter him. Toby did not notice him at first, but strode up to the table, impatiently tossing over the news papers Avhich lay there, and complaining in loud angry tones, \" What becomes of all our papers ? I believe the servants prig them. You never can find what you want.\" Then somebody nudged him, directing his atten tion to the seat near the fireplace, where little Mr Brooks sat, half-covered by the sheet of a journal.

I know this isn't the place to talk shop, but, for your own good, I beg you not to fail in writing the imposition, for if it is not forth coming at the time I appointed, you shall have it doubled again.\" Toby gave a snort, and buried himself in his paper. Presently, as Mr Brooks was leaving the room, he asked, half aloud, \"What's that cad doing here ? \" Mr Brooks started, stopped, took two or three more steps toAvards the door, but soon turned round upon Toby. \" Are you speaking of me ? AnsAver me, sir.\" Toby did not answer for a moment or two, then said, deliberately, \" I wasn't speaking to you.\" \" Equivocation ! \" cried the English master, suddenly stirred to high excitement. \" Did you call me a cad ?

He had gone further than he may have intended, but he was not going to draw back before all the other boys, who were staring at this unaccountable outbreak. \" And what do you mean, Hill, by this insolence? Nobody, however high in the school, has any right to offer such an insult to a master. It is unbear able!\" cried Mr Brooks, his voice trembling with passion, for he too had lost his temper, Avhile, as he flamed out, Toby greAv sullen and dogged. \" I said Avhat I said, and you can think what you like to think of it, if you will come spying about to hear what we say of you.\" \" Hold your stupid tongue, Toby,\" interposed the fellow who had brought Mr Brooks into the room. \" He doesn't think Avhat he is saying, sir.

It so happened that Mr Brooks came across the Warden almost immediately, Avho, on hearing his complaint, thought it a matter of such importance as to be looked into Avithout delay. They both came to me as master of the house to which Toby belonged, and so for the first time I learned something of Avhat my troublesome charge had been about. My private room was turned into a court, whither Toby and two or three other boys, as witnesses, were summoned forthwith. Then came a scene not usual in public-school life. Before us three inquisitors stood the culprit, red-handed from his offence, and still in the very worst of tempers, though somewhat subdued by finding himself in the presence of the Warden. Mr Brooks, excited and angry as few had ever seen him, could hardly compose himself so as to make his accusation. Toby, called on for his defence, mumbled out a few lame sentences. \" He said this \u2014 and he said that \u2014 and he did so and so.\" \"Don't call me he, sir! Call me Mr Brooks,\" burst out the English master, fuming Avith pent-up indignation. \" Well he \u2014 I mean Mr Brooks \u2014 told me that he \u2014 I mean Mr Brooks \u2014 wouldn't let me give him \u2014 I mean Mr Brooks.\" The misguided boy was evidently trying to brazen out his rudeness by fresh impertinence, seeing no less silly way of facing the danger ; but the Warden quickly cut him short."], [191, "Toby. 179 \" Silence, sir ! You are only proving more and more distinctly the truth of Mr Brooks' s complaint against you. I will hear no more. You must of course write this imposition, and double, as you were ordered ; but you must also apologise to Mr Brooks before all your form, for the gross insolence with which you have behaved towards him.\" \" On what compulsion must L? tell me that!\" so might be translated the hard-set look that came over Toby's face as he heard this. \"Or else you must leave the school,\" the Warden Avent on, in his calm, determined tones, far more formidable than the most violent ebullition of passion. \" This is not the first time that I have had similar complaints against you ; but I mean it to be the last. All discipline would be at an end if ill-conditioned boys were with impunity to dis obey and insult any master as you take it upon yourself to do.\" \" I am not going to apologise,\" suddenly snarled Toby, with his ugliest frown ; but the Warden took no notice of this interruption. \" You will have one day to think over it. To morrow at five o'clock I shall come to the fifth form room, where every boy will be in his place. Mr Brooks, will you be so good as to be present ? And this boy may then take his choice between begging your pardon most unreservedly, or ceasing to belong to the school, which shall consist of gentlemen so long as I am at the head of it.\" At this mention of gentlemen you should have seen the scornfully significant smile which Toby"], [192, "180 A Schoolmaster's Stories. turned upon Mr Brooks, making the poor man flush and tremble afresh. The other boys who were present seemed concerned for their audacious schoolfellow ; but his temper had fairly got the bit between its teeth now, and threats and warnings could only rouse him to a higher pitch of cantank erous obstinacy. William Tell refusing to salute the tyrant's cap, Wallace spurning allegiance to the English king, Demosthenes denouncing Philip, Ajax defying the lightning, Horatius Codes defending the bridge, Guy FaAvkes before his judges, Roderick Dhu face to face with Fitzjames, the Old Guard declaring that it died but never surrendered, \u2014 none of these famous characters could have worn a loftier mien of defiance than this hulking lad gave back to the coldly severe gaze of our Head, and with an impudent stare silently dared him to do his Avorst. \" What studied torments, tyrant, hast thou for me ? What wheels ? racks ? fires ? What flaying, boiling In leads or oils ? What old or newer torture Must I receive?\" It Avas an absurd and also a painful exhibition. I, who always had a sneaking kindness for Toby, in spite of his faults, never saw him look to so little advantage. So at this point I will drop the curtain, only giving the reader to know that our Warden was a man as little likely to alter his decrees as if they were laws of the Medes and Persians. And iioav, Toby, thou art in a parlous case, unless thou canst bend that dogged spirit of thine to pass humbly beneath the yoke."], [193, "Toby. 181 III. It would be a bad business for most of us if sleep did not sometimes bring wisdom to correct our hot-headed resolutions of the day before. Next morning I hoped Toby might have slept off some of his stiff-neckedness, and be more in a mood for listening to reason. So I set to him, first Rees-PoAvell, the head of the house, then Ferrier, a fellow in his own form and a crony of his, to persuade him to apologise, write his imposition, and, in short, admit that he had behaved very stupidly. But both my emissaries brought back the same unfavourable report. All the sensible fellows told Toby he was quite Avrong ; everybody told him he would have to give in ; but their Avords might as well have been wasted on a mule, for all the signs of relenting he showed. He appeared determined to pay the penalty and forfeit of his folly rather than confess it. The English master might take his pound of flesh, but should have no apology from him. That was the gist of Toby's answer to remonstrances from every side. As for Mr Brooks, the prosecutor of this suit, he was not Avorth twopence in the part of Shylock. He had insisted, indeed, on his bond, the im position, to wit, because so it seemed right' to him, and he had appealed for the Warden's help in a passing fit of strong irritation ; but now that the"], [194, "182 A Schoolmaster's Stories. adversary was at his feet he almost repented of this victory. He was a tender-hearted man, the English master, though he did try to knit his brows and speak from the bottom of his chest when careless little urchins forgot to stroke their t's, or made their Q's like z's. Legends are still handed down in the school of the ease Avith which he could be appeased or hoodwinked. In the good old days, they say, when order was kept by promiscuous and frequent caning administered on the spot at discretion of the master, he alone was not allowed to use this power himself, but must commit his criminals to a superior court for punishment. So when his naughty little boys grew past endurance, he would pack them off to the executioner with much reluctance, and some of the young rascals, so the story goes, would take a turn in the fives court for ten minutes or so, then come back to his class room rubbing their eyes and looking greatly subdued, to be received by good Mr Brooks with a few words of kindly condolence and wholesome admonition. \" I told you it would come to this. I am very sorry for you, but you gave me no choice. Please don't oblige me to have to do it again, but if you will be idle and inattentive, you must learn that I am not to be trifled with ! \" This last sentence would be in the deep voice by which he \" made believe very much \" to be angry, and we may imagine the sly chuckling of his penitents."], [195, "Toby. 183 Such a man Avas not likely to let the sun go down on his Avrath. A night had thawed it into pity and self-reproach. He came to me quite distressed about Toby's predicament. \" The fact is, I am afraid I lost my own temper, and drove him into this.\" \" No Avonder, Avhen he was so abominably rude ! \" declared I, naturally sympathising with the master's side of the case. \" He can blame nobody but himself.\" \" But I can't bear to think of his being sent aAvay from school on my account.\" \" It is not on your account only, Mr Brooks. He has got into ever so many scrapes through his temper ; he has been punished, and warned, and reasoned with, again and again ; and Avhat more can be done Avith him ? If every boy in the school were as hard to manage as this one, we should have to start a steam thrashing-machine to take the chaff out of them, and even then we might as well shut up the place for all the grain Ave could grind.\" Finding that I could give him no better comfort, Mr Brooks turned away with a sigh, which seemed to echo that exclamation of Dr Johnson, or Dr Watts, or Izaak Walton, or somebody, that it is better to be a poor fisherman than to meddle with the ruling of boys ! In the course of the forenoon I gave audience to another advocate, the joker Goodfellow, who was not a bad felloAv in his way, and, now that things Avere looking so serious, showed"], [196, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 184 himself really concerned for Toby. But he had nothing to say which did not tell against his client. \"He declares he Avon't apologise to anybody. Isn't he stupid, sir? Every fellow in our eleven would apologise for him, if that would be any good ; I'll apologise myself till I'm black in the face,\" Goodfellow told me; and I thought none the worse of him that, in his eagerness, he used a somewhat abrupt style of language. \"You must talk to him, then; you must use your influence with him not to let him persevere in such a mad resolution.\" \"Well, sir, I have talked to him till I'm sick of it, and he just looks at one ugly enough to frighten a donkey out of its hide. What else can one do ? \" \" Nothing, I am afraid, if he is not sorry.\" \" But he is, sir, and that's the worst of it. He knows he has made an infatuated idiot of himself, as Avell as I do, and so he is all the more deter mined not to own it. That's the sort of fellow he is.\" \" Then he must suffer what he has deserved,\" said I, yet not without recalling Hamlet's remark on what would happen to us all if we had nothing but our deserts meted out to us. It was because I happened to be his house master that they consulted me to save him from the consequences of his OAvn folly. But what could I do ? The only hope lay in moving not the judge but the criminal to have mercy on"], [197, "Toby. 185 himself. As for the Warden, Ave all knew by this time that \u2014 \" You may as well go stand upon the beach, And bid the main flood bate his usual height; You may as well use question with the wolf Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb \" \u2014 etc. as seek to soften his heart when once he had given judgment. We used to think our Head too inexorable in his severity, but it had adA'antages : he was able to do Avith far fewer punishments than his pre decessor, and yet upheld discipline with such a firm hand that his under masters could, if they pleased, afford to lay themselves out for genial popularity under the shadow of this masterful rule. Besides, in this case, he seemed clearly in the right to throw his \u00e6gis over worthy Mr Brooks, and launch his heaviest thunderbolt against the rebel Avho would fain upheave the Pelions and Ossas of scholastic decorum. Was I, then, to go on my knees to this pig headed Toby, and beg and beseech him to be civil, reasonable, mindful of his own welfare ? It would not indeed be the first time I had been driven to use some such tone with him. It appeared as if at certain intervals, in the first heats of spring, or when thunder was in the air, or haply his stomach being out of order, this troublesome lad took a fit of rudeness, during the continuance of Avhich there was no dealing Avith him by any means in our pharmacop\u0153ia, \u2014 when one would rather bring you the length of Prester John's foot,"], [198, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 186 fetch you a hair off the great Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies than hold three words conference with such a harpy. I some times thought the best thing for him might be a few weeks at Mr Squeers's academy, where a course of brimstone and treacle would surely have availed to SAveeten his blood, while a constant succession of irritating external applications could not but have helped to increase the circulation and throw off the bad humours by the skin. I was walking up and down my room after school, in two minds whether or no it would be worth while speaking to Toby myself. I chanced to look out of the window, and who should I see but the very boy ! He was lounging slowly across the quadrangle, kicking the gravel with his feet, his hands in his pockets, and on his broad face the ugliest shade of that expression which at once explained how he came to be called Toby. If he had been aware of my eye upon him, he would probably have whistled and tried to look careless, but, as it was, he wore an unmistakable downcast air. While I watched, something happened to stir him into action. Two small boys were playing fives. There arrived upon the scene two bigger boys, who, wanting the court themselves, forthwith began to turn out those in possession, on the \" good old rule, the simple plan \" of keep who can. But suddenly Toby stepped forward to interfere, and drove away the intruders, not without vehem ence. This was the better side of his character ;"], [199, "Toby. 187 he always stood up for fair play, at least Avhen his own rights or pretensions were not in question. And this decided me to make one more appeal to him, even at the risk of his being insolent to myself. I went out into the passage and impressed the first boy I met to carry a message to him ; then presently he stood in my doorway, doing his best to look unconscious of any cause for such an interview. \" Sit doAvn, Hill,\" I began, thinking thus to deal with him in a more friendly spirit. Slouching forAvard as little way as need be into my den, he dropped on the edge of the nearest chair, Avhile I leant against the mantelpiece, think ing over the line that I should try with him. Thus, figuratively speaking, we took up our ground for a fencing bout of words, and Toby stood stiffly on his guard, waiting for me to attack. \" What a pity all this is, isn't it ?\" \" Yes, sir.\" \" Are you not going to own that you are to blame ? \" \" No, sir.\" \" Then you knoAV what you must expect ? \" \" Yes, sir. These, of course, were only slight preliminary passes, such as duellists make to try their own dexterity and the strength of the opponent's Avrist.

Even so, Avhen this adversary of mine prepared himself to encounter rebuke, he found himself obliged to parry a thrust of flattery. \" Toby \u2014 you don't mind my calling you Toby, do you ? \u2014 you can't think how sorry we all are about this. There is so much about you to like, Avhich you won't let us do justice to. I saw you just now standing up for these small fellows ; and you don't know hoAV much better you looked than when defying Mr Brooks in your Avretched temper. Now, if you must be rude, I Avould rather see you rude to those who can make you suffer for it, and not to small boys Avho can do you neither good nor harm. It shows you have courage, at least, which is the best half of some other virtues. But courage, Toby, more than any other virtue, is set off by courtesy.\" I paused here to see hoAV he took this ; but he said nothing, as if perceiving that this was only a feint as yet, and that I would come to the point presently. \" Yes \u2014 it is no sign of a thoroughly bad disposi tion to defy your masters, though it is certainly stupid of you. But masters, surely, are your felloAv-creatures, and you must be fair to them as well as to other people. In a school, or an army, or any other community, some persons must be obeyed.

If those set under them fail in respect or obedience, they must be put right by remonstrance and punishments, unless you can tell me any other means for recalling them to their duty. Such remonstrances and punishments must be borne patiently, at least submissively, or we should be always at loggerheads, superiors with inferiors. No boy need be treated with gross injustice ; there is an appeal to the Head, who Avould keep the other masters from playing the tyrant if they Avished to do so ; but no boy, hoAv ever high up in the school, is to set himself up for the judge of Avhat he may say and do \u2014 as you have practically done. There can only be one leader at a time, if the team is to pull together.\" I expected great things from this figure of speech, as I knew Toby's interest in horseflesh. But metaphors did not easily take hold of his mind ; he Avas a most matter-of-fact lad, who might have understood that Rome Avas built by night, if you had told him that it Avas not built in a day. So now he looked blankly unconvinced ; and when I still assailed him Avith excellent reasons, such as should have forced conviction on him by every rule of art, he all at once closed upon me, putting aside my keen logical blade with a downright blow. \" I'm not going to apologise, sir.\" \" But Avhy not ? \" \" Because I said I wouldn't,\" snapped out Toby Avith his darkest scowl. I felt half inclined to take and shake him Avith"], [202, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 190 some such exclamation as, \" Thou art as Avise as thou art beautiful ! \" but I kept my patience and tried another way of reaching him. \" Toby, Toby, you think I am speaking to you as a mere matter of duty, like a grave fogy who can't sympathise with your troubles and tempta tions, but it is not so ; Ave have all our own faults to fight against ; it is only that I am older and surely a little wiser than I once was, and know better what comes of giving way to the evil passions of our nature. It is not because I am your master that I urge you thus, but because I look back to my own boyhood and see with sorroAV how often I did wrong and foolishly, and think how grateful I should be now to any man who had persuaded me against my errors in time to save me from their consequences. And so will you, I trust, recognise your folly when you grow older, and bitterly repent of it Avhen too late. Toby, for your own sake and for mine, I beg you not to be obstinate in this matter.\" Surely I had got inside his guard now. To drive home the thrust I stepped forward and laid my hand upon his shoulder in a paternal way. But he stood up as if to say, \" Paws off, and keep your distance ! \" Would nothing move him ? \" If I had my mouth, I Avould bite ; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking ; in the meanwhile let me be that I am and seek not to alter me.\" That Avas what his looks spoke for the fellow. \" You have given me as much trouble as any"], [203, "Toby. 191 one, but I shall be really sorry if you have to leave.\" \" So shall I,\" said Toby, in a husky voice. \" I shan't bear any malice against you, sir.\" \" I hope you have no reason to ; but never mind me, think of yourself. Don't be a blockhead ; you Avill have to give in, and it's no use pretending you don't care.\" Ah ! I struck the Avrong note there. I had just begun to hope that I Avas tickling him into sub mission, but at the first hint of a threat he drew back into his shell. Much discouraged, I still con tinued my pleadings, entering with him into such serious considerations as are not to be repeated here ; but in the end, all I could get out of him was, \" I will write the imposition because \u2014 because you say I have deserved it. But I won't make an apology.\" With this he drew himself up in all the haughty pride ever shown by his mailed ancestors towards such despicable people as kept quiet and tried to make themselves useful in the Avorld, and I gave it up as useless to combat further with his false notion of honour and consistency. \" What Avill your father say ? \" This was my last shot. \" My father Avouldn't wish me to lower myself before an usher ! \" quoth Toby, his nose in the air.

It may well seem to some critics that I too much show the humorous side of this affair ; but if I laugh, it is in the spirit of the ancient phil osopher, who laughed that he might not be obliged to weep. We schoolmasters would have no heart for our work if we Avere to dwell always on its graver aspects. Every day and hour we see how these thoughtless lads struggle to have their own way, knowing not, as Ave do, what will come of it, and heeding not the shoals and quicksands against Avhich we, too, in our own hot boyhood, may have refused to be warned. Ah, the ignorant self-con fidence of youth! Truly said a wise man that \"no preacher is listened to but Time, which gives us the same train and turn of thought that elder people have in vain tried to put into our heads before.\" Well is it if Time's teaching be thus blessed to us, and if it come not too late ! Poor Toby is not the only boy whom I have had to see going far astray, Avhile I must stand by helpless, and let some will-o'-the-wisp lure him on to ruin. Mr Brooks, as I expected, had been equally unsuccessful in an appeal to the Warden to relax his sentence. Thus matters remained at a dead lock. Toby was like a vessel drifting on a lee shore ; unless he tacked in time, he Avas bound to go to pieces, and the eyes of all the school Avere fixed upon him with keen interest. Most of the fellows felt sorry for him, especially among the cricketers. A few, however, may not have been"], [205, "Toby. 193 ill-pleased at his danger, for he was a boy Avho had dislikes, and not much skill in hiding them.

His schoolfellows recalled the last case of expulsion \u2014 hoAV the criminal trembled and greAv Avhite before them all ; hoAV the Warden had called for a pen in his sternest tones, and with one scornful dash scored through that unhappy name in the school lists, an expressive action that needed no Avords to make the spectators think they would rather be flogged twice a day for a fortnight than come within risk of such a doom. For a school like ours was no hateful prison, but one in which the scholar might well be pleased \" to linger a glad votary, And not a captive pining for his home.\" This Avas the first fine day of the summer term, and the opening of the cricket season. In the afternoon I strolled down to our playing-field, to enjoy the sunshine merely, for I am no great cricketer myself. There is a hillock in one corner of the field, surmounted by a flagstaff and a seat, from Avhich quite an extensive view can be had over that flat county. I sat down there with a balmy breeze in my face, and looked upon the stretch of fresh grass, dotted by gay new flannels, like a meadow bright Avith May flowers. From every side came the cheerful click of the cricket-bats, and the sound of merry young voices, mingled from time to time with the cry of the cuckoo from a budding N"], [206, "A Schoolmaster s Stories. 194 wood beyond. It was such an hour as makes one wonder how boys or men can ever be unhappy. But for all these pleasant sights and sounds, I felt ill at ease, thinking of the unfortunate Toby. Toby had come out, too, to take a last look at that scene of his glory, where he had tAvice won the high jump, besides races innumerable, where he had kicked so many a goal, Avhere, in such Avell-remembered matches, he had made dozens and scores, and carried out his victorious bat. He was in no mind to play, but, like self-fated Alcestis, wandered with full heart by each familiar spot, bidding all a mute fareAvell ; or, like Othello, he might be saying to himself that \u2014 \"Since these arms of mine had seven years' pith Till now, some nine moons wasted, they have used Their dearest action in the tented field.\" But now, so far as our school was concerned, for ever farewell the flannelled troop and the smooth turf that make ambition virtue ! Oh, farewell the flying ball and the quick catch, the mighty hit, the spirit-stirring cheers, the famous score; all the pomp, pride, and circumstance of cricket, farewell ! Toby's occupation was gone. With him came a small chorus of sympathisers \u2014 some intimate friends, some fellows of the baser sort, who now backed him up simply because he Avas in trouble with the masters, following this martyr to pig-headedness as loyally as the pupils of condemned Socrates, or as the ladies of un crowned Mary Stuart."], [207, "Toby. 195 I watched them approach the hillock on Avhich I sat. At the foot of it Mr Brooks happened to be lying on the grass, scoring for an eleven of small boys Avho were trying their 'prentice hands in this rough and out-of-the-way corner of the field. It was to be expected that Toby, on seeing him, would have passed hastily on. No ! he halted just behind the English master, and stood there critically Avatching the small boys' play, affecting not to notice his enemy. Mr Brooks Avas aware of him, and looked studiously away. \" Well bowled for a young one ! \" applauded the veteran of the second eleven, as the bails flew up, and the little long-stop treated himself to an exulting catch before throwing back the ball. Toby spoke as quietly as if he had nothing to think of but the promise shown by these callow cricketers. \" Next man ' \" cried the captain of the puny eleven Avith much dignity; then Toby set himself intently to watch the new batter's performances, while Mr Brooks' eyes remained fixed on his scoring list. If you had been a stranger standing by, you would hardly have guessed what strong feelings Avere swelling in the heart of more than one of those spectators. In the meanwhile, some restless urchins from the side that was in had found mischief for their idle hands to do. A team of them, harnessed to a roller, with which the turf of the first eleven had just been smoothed, were dragging it up the hillock,"], [208, "196 A Schoolmaster's Stories. but stopped near the top, having spent all their breath in tugging and laughing. \" Take care what you are about Avith that roller,\" I said to them. \" You will let it slip if you don't mind.\" \" Don't leave go, you donkeys. I can't hold it!\" exclaimed one of them. Then it happened just as I had feared. The roller began to move back Avith its own weight, only one tiny fellow manfully pulling at it \u2014 the rest had thrown them selves panting on the ground. He was forced to let go before I could run forward to help him, and away rolled the heavy cylinder, thumping and rattling doAvn the hillock. \" Look out, Mr Brooks ! \" some one cried loudly. Mr Brooks started, without, as yet, seeing his danger. The roller was coming down right behind him, faster and faster as it neared the bottom. In another moment it would have been upon him, flattening him to a pancake, when Toby made a stride forward, and put his leg in the Avay. Down he went like a ninepin, but the roller Avas checked in its Avild career, and somebody threw himself on the handle to bring it to a stand. There was a cry, a rush, a ring of boys pressing round the spot. I burst through them to see Toby lying helplessly on the ground Avith clenched lips and white face. He Avas badly hurt."], [209, "Toby. 197 IV. YES, for the first time in his life Toby had fainted aAvay, and on examination I saw that his leg must be broken, if, indeed, that were the full extent of the mischief.

There could be no question of expelling or apologising now. Mr Brooks himself could not bear to hear the matter even mentioned. He was naturally much agitated, as he could not but know that this young rebel against his authority had just saved him from dangerous if not fatal injury. And Toby's proud, angry humour had all vanished like a burst soap-bubble. He was not fit to say much, but it was the English master and myself Avhom he asked to hold his hands while he went through the ordeal of having the leg set."], [210, "198 A Schoolmaster's Stories. It was a bad hurt, the doctor confessed, and at the best the cure must be long and difficult. Fever presently set in ; for days the boy hardly knew what he was saying. The second or third evening, when I looked in to see how he was doing, he seemed to take me for Mr Brooks, and, staring at me with wild, eager eyes, he muttered deliriously, \" I deserved it, I did, and if you give me tAvice as many more, I'll go and do them this minute \u2014 this very minute.\" \"Hush, Toby!\" I said, laying my hand on his hot forehead, \" never mind that just noAV.\" \" But I will mind !

Poor lad ! I believe he never knew his mother, and, if all stories Avere true, his home could not have been a very fortunate one ; this might account for much in him.

When he was able to be moved to the seaside it seemed quite doubtful if he would come back to us, or if he did come back to school it might be but to handle his crutch and show the young ones how games were Avon. Toby was nothing if not athletical. We could not fancy him a cripple. Poor fellow, if he found it so hard to be patient Avith the full use of his limbs, how Avould he get along through the world on one leg ! These fears, however, Avere happily not justified. Soon after the summer holidays Toby came back to school, a little thinner and taller, and with his ankle stiff for a time, but to all appearance strong as ever, and broAvn as a brigand, from a long yacht voyage in the Mediterranean. We Avere all glad to see him, his outbreak of the last term being tacitly ignored. For his part, he was markedly subdued in manner, and took much pains in showing himself aAvkwardly civil to Mr Brooks and the rest of the masters when he came in contact Avith them. I was much pleased with the change, but, to make it more lasting, I thought well to point for him the moral of Avhat had happened. \" Hill, Avhat a fine fellow you are at bearing pain ! \" I told him. \" You made no more of having that leg set than if you had been a Red Indian at the stake ; and, if all stories are true, when you were lower down in the school, you have been flogged as often as a Spartan and made as light of it \u2014 rather too light of it, I am afraid.

Why not show some of the same courage under the rubs and crosses and sorenesses we have all to bear Avith more or less manfulness from one end of life to the other? It is a small matter to be hard and tough to bodily pain, if we fret and sulk like children as often as things don't turn out to our mind. Whatever position in life you may attain, you are not likely to be free from persons Avhose business or pleasure it will be to worry you Avhen they think you are going wrong, and at school you have a good chance of practising on your masters, so as to learn to take such fault-finding quietly !

You are always thinking that those set over you behave unfairly to you ; that's what we all think at times, and we are not always wrong. Yet life wouldn't be worth having if we Avere to groan and fume over every such injury that is done us. It is annoying for the time ; but one will have forgotten all about it by the day after to-morrow at farthest. Look in this way at any unpleasantness you may have Avith your masters.

As usual, I Avas Avell satisfied with my own eloquence, but, as usual, it did not seem to make much impression on this boy. He looked dogged as ever, and I feared I had been casting the pearls of my experience before a most unappreciative animal. The same evrening, however, he sent me an embassy in the shape of his friend Goodfellow, who opened his communication abruptly, thus : \" Toby wants to say to you, sir, that he is much obliged to you for Avhat you said to him this morning.\" \" Indeed ! then why couldn't he have said so himself?\" \"Well, he says you make him feel sentimental- Avhen you lecture him, and then he doesn't know what to say, Avithout making a fool of himself.\""], [216, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 204 (Oh, and I had thought I might as well be lecturing the figure in front of a snuff-shop !) \" You see, sir, he knows he has a bad temper ; 'it is his nature to'; and he wishes it Avasn't. So he told me to say that whenever you see him getting into the least bit of a wax, he wants you to come doAvn on him like a hundredweight of bricks before he can show his teeth.\" Master Goodfellow appeared to take a somewhat too free-and-easy style with me, so I thought to crush him Avith the Aveight of my learning. \" Have you ever heard of the Archbishop of Grenada ? \" I asked him. \" I can't say that I have, sir,\" was his reply, and he retired in some mystification, with no other answer to his errand. But my readers, I take for granted, are better read than this saucy youth, and they remember, no doubt, the story of that episcopal author and his amanuensis, Gil Bias. \" Offended at you for speaking your mind \u2014 certainly not ! \" cried the Archbishop, fretfully. \" I should be a bad man if I liked you the less for such a virtue as sincerity. You are right to speak Avhat you think, if only your thoughts were Avorth speaking. But I have been deceived, Master Gil Bias, by your outside show of cleverness without any foundation of sober judgment.

Get"], [217, "Toby. 205 about your business, sir, and never let me see you again ! \" Some such reception I feared for myself, if I should venture on accepting Toby's invitation to speak plainly to him of his shortcomings. But you may suppose that I kept my eye upon him, and for a long time saw nothing to blame. Toby had become an extinct volcano, according to the accounts of all the masters Avho had to do with him, yet we Avere none of us sure that any day or hour might not bring forth a fresh eruption. After a long spell of such serenity in his temper, came signs once more of a storm. I had occasion to find fault Avith him for some infraction of dis cipline, I really forget Avhat, and gave him an imposition for it according to the rules in such case made and provided. I believe, indeed, there was a slight element of doubt in this case, but I did not let him have the benefit of the doubt, as one had to make quite clear that one was not afraid of his resentment. \" Oh, sir, that's not worth two hundred lines,\" he remonstrated. \"That's for me to decide,\" quoth I, and he said no more, but the old barking-and-biting look came into his face, and as he went out from my presence he banged the door behind him with significant violence. Aha ! the black dog back again. Here was my cue to jog his conscience, according to the request made through Goodfellow. On reflection, I did not shrink from the perilous task, and resolved to"], [218, "206 A Schoolmaster's Stories. perform it in the most friendly and unofficial manner possible. I would pay him a visit in his study ; that term he had been promoted to a vacant study. Such a den was looked on as a boy's castle, Avhere it was not usual for a master to intrude himself under ordinary circumstances. But Toby had specially invited me to call on him and look at his collection of birds' eggs. So I went there a little before tea-time, and knocked modestly at the door, having approached this part of my dominions with as much circumspection as King Alfred stealing into the camp of the Danes. For answer to my summons came back a curious muffled grunt, which I took for permission to enter, and did so. There stood Toby, with his white flannel trousers freshly mud-stained, in the act of struggling out of a jersey he had drawn half over his head at the moment of my appearance. He had just come in from football. \" Now then ! \" growled a rough voice from inside of the striped jersey. \" Are you going to leave that door open, or are you going to shut it? It isn't the middle of summer, you know.\" \" I'll come back presently, Hill ; I didn't know you were at your toilet.\" By this time Toby, with a mighty tug, had stripped himself of his clinging garment, and turned round to be covered with confusion when he saw whom he had been addressing in this off-hand style. \" I beg your pardon, sir; I thought it was one of"], [219, "Toby. 207 the fellows. Here's these lines, if that's Avhat you Avant.

The last but one seemed still raw, and the last Avas a fresh blister, Avhich had just been broken. I took his arm to examine it, for I really thought this must be the symptom of some disease. Then Toby blushed like a girl. \" It's only a \u2014 little Avay of mine,\" he stammered. \"A queer Avay, surely. Are you trying to turn yourself into a zebra ? How did you make these marks ? \" \" With a little bit of blistering tissue,\" he said, after a minute's silence \u2014 \" fly-blister, you know, sir; it gets all right in a feAV days.\" \" But what have you to do with fly-blisters ? \" I persisted. \" Is this by the doctor's orders, or are you practising veterinary surgery on your own skin \u2014 Fiat experimentum in corpore vili \u2014 eh ?

He seemed to be in a glow of unusual communicative ness after the excitement of football. \" I'll tell you if you won't tell anybody. It's a secret, but you have found it out, so you may as well know all about it, especially as it was your doing. There's nothing to be ashamed of.\" \" My doing ! \" I said, in surprise, but from his serious tone I began now to have some inkling of the truth. \" I suppose this is a sort of voluntary penance which you inflict on yourself, like a hermit in his cell ? \" \" You may call it what you like, sir. It's a dodge of mine to get the better of my beastly temper. You remember what you said to me about that ? Well, I went to a chemist's and bought threepence worth of this stuff.

As often as I feel myself getting into a wax, I stick a strip on here, and keep it on till the sulks are all drawn out of me. You see this new one ? that means slamming your door this morning. It works very well, just like vaccinating yourself for the small-pox, or anything. I have had a good deal more than threepence-worth of value out of it.

There was a good deal to be thought and said about such a mode of mortifying the flesh, but it seemed best to think it over and take another opportunity of discussing the matter with him. So, promising to keep his secret, I left him for the meanwhile to put on his shirt, and went away Avithout further remark, glad, at least, to know that my troublesome pupil had, after all, laid good advice so much to heart, and wondering hoAV many of us would undertake such methods of coercion for our besetting sins. By this time I recognised the fact that my friend Toby did not Avear his heart upon his sleeve for me to peck at. So, on consideration, I never made any further allusion to that secret under his jacket. It seemed nobody's business but his own. So far as I am aware, no harm came of it except in the case of one fag of his, who, as I understood, happened to find this blistering material in Toby's study, and put a piece on his finger, mistaking it for sticking-plaster. That is what comes of meddling with other people's matters. I had to judge of results, and not of means, and this much I know, that for the future my pupil's conduct was more satisfactory in all that came under the masters' notice, while his behaviour towards me continued exemplary. He might sometimes think himself ill-used, but if so, he gave his thoughts no tongue. Mr Brooks declared that 0"], [222, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 210 he was quite a different boy since the accident.

Toby was at no time fond of Avriting, either letters or impositions. I have often thought of him since, hoping he took the right side, for there is a right and a wrong side in the battle of life, and Avhichever side Toby took he Avould be sure to throw himself into it with all the dogged energy and vehemence of his character."], [223, "THE TROUBLES OF A TYRANT. There is a certain midland market-town, which, if I were to mention its name, most of my readers Avould recognise as having seen it in the atlas, and some might even remember from their geography books the particular branch of trade for Avhich it is not without note, but hardly one in a hundred Avould be likely to know anything more about it. Enough to say that it stands in the heart of the clay counties, where the cream of British stolidity seems to have curdled itself into something Avhich, in my haste, I have called hopeless stupidity. This town boasts a Grammar School, the master ship of Avhich came to be advertised as vacant, whereupon my testimonials, among the many sent in, happened to recommend themselves most to the governing body. So it behoved me to leave the larger school at which I had passed several years as an assistant-master, and take my seat upon Avhat our headmaster somewhat condescend ingly spoke of as a \" provincial throne.\" I was sorry to leave the old place, yet it was a certain pleasure to me to think that I should be 211"], [224, "A Schoolmasters Stories. 212 missed there. I had always fancied myself un popular among the boys, as too strict and meddle some. At the best they had seemed to bear Avith me for a well-meaning person. But noAV they came fonvard in a manner that showed my toilsome anxiety not wholly unappreciated among them. Boys do not shine in the use of words; their deeds spoke for them on this occasion. My pupils spontaneously got up a handsome subscription to present me with a testimonial, which, as I told them, \" I should always treasure for reasons far beyond the consideration of its intrinsic value.\" It Avas indeed a gratifying token of esteem, having only the inconvenience of being such a gorgeous possession that for some years we were obliged to keep it out of sight, unable to live up to it in our modest household. I say we, not as using the royal style, though in their way schoolmasters are quite as great persons as any modern kings ; but the secret must come out now. I had taken to myself a wife, and that was the cause of my having to look about for a new post. I need not dwell on my dear Mary's attractions ; if I had not seen her to be the best of women I should have been in no such haste to become a Benedick. Enough to say that she was not one to despise the humble cares of a country schoolmaster's wife, but Avith all her kindly heart hoped to aid me in studying the welfare and happiness of those young people to whom, for \" three divisions of the quartered year,\" we were to stand in the place of their parents."], [225, "The Troubles of a Tyrant. 213 We had not much time to prepare for our campaign, as the holidays at this old-fashioned little place ended not long after the beginning of those at my former battlefield. We were married at a country church near Carlisle, made a hurried honeymoon trip to the Irish Lakes, then entered upon our new abode, Avhich friends had taken the main charge of furnishing for us, not altogether, indeed, to my wife's satisfaction, since a woman naturally likes to exercise her own taste in the smallest household matters. The school house Avas a comfortable and rather picturesque building, well enough adapted for its purposes, and the governors promised all sorts of further improvements and extensions as soon as I could justify them by success, which, coming from such a school, one did not doubt of doing. Under the hopefullest auspices, then, Ave began Avith some twenty boarders and about as many day boys. The day-boys, for whose chief benefit the school had originally been founded, had fallen rather into the background, genteel folks of this town preferring to send their sons away from home, while the tradespeople Avere apt to be led astray by the meretricious advertisements of a certain flourishing academy in the neigh bourhood, these worthy citizens having no great faith in Latin and Greek, but more or less consciously inclining to Chaucer's opinion that \"the greatest clerks be not the wisest men.\" It seemed to them, as to the Miller of the Floss, that such an one as I must be too \"high learned\""], [226, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 214 \u2014 save the mark! \u2014 to make a good practical schoolmaster. The master whom I succeeded was, so far as I could learn, an easy-going, slovenly old gentle man, rather a favourite with the boys than other wise, in spite of a somewhat violent temper, but rusty in his scholarship, and quite behind the age in all that relates to school management ; his reign had evidently been an inefficient despotism tempered by many holidays. People spoke with a certain kindly regret of \" old Grove,\" and while my pupils were buying me a Avedding present his Avere subscribing to put up for him a fine tomb stone \u2014 such is life ! \u2014 under Avhich he lay duly credited with all the virtues of a man and school master. All the same, it was freely hinted to me that I should do Avell not to folloAV too closely in his steps, as I could see plainly for myself when once I got to work. With a zeal and energy which my modesty cannot dissemble, I entered upon the task of bringing things up to the mark ; then, like other reformers, had a long weary struggle with the innate sluggishness of my young provincials, who, like other reformees, showed a deeply-rooted dislike to change. From the first, troubles arose between us, caused as much by our not under standing each other, as by intent on either side. They were a decent, Avholesome set of boys upon the whole, Avith faults of their own, like the rest of us, for the most part attributable to the way they had been mismanaged, for \" like master,"], [227, "The Troubles of a Tyrant. 215 like scholar,\" makes a saying just as true as the proverb from which it is plagiarised. My boarders, Avho formed the aristocracy of the community, Avere mostly of bucolic antecedents, and, as I have noticed that Colin Clout, whatever he may be in poetry, is apt to prove a somewhat thick headed person in real life, so they, on their side, had no opinion of me because, however Avell versed in grammar, I knew nothing about horses, and cared as little about dogs. They themselves were like a herd of rough young colts, which it must be my task to trim and train, and break into some of the paces of a thoroughbred. The day-boys were only too submissive, meek as oxen, but no less slowly driven along the road to Parnassus. In both classes alike I found a deplorable want of the \" go \" and smartness to Avhich I had been accustomed in my last post. That public school Avhere I mainly served my apprenticeship as a teacher, is distinguished by a certain \" tone \" Avhich I had learnt to look on as the hall-mark of right education, and to the communication of which I devoted myself with all the fervour of a convert, not to the manner born, yet plus roy alls te que le roi. Judged by this standard, which I confess to having rather made an idol of in those days, the manners and customs of my new pupils left much to be desired. As to their notion of learning, I dare not trust myself to speak : it was simply heart-breaking. It seemed scarcely less a scandal that they cared as little for hearty play as for"], [228, "216 A Schoolmaster's Stories. honest work ; they frittered aAvay the play-hours in childish pastimes, instead of concentrating their energies on those two great games Avhich are what Latin and Greek have been in the school-room, the sun and moon of our educational world. It was another simple sin in them, that they showed no esprit de corps except in deceiving or inertly opposing me : there, indeed, their unanimity Avas wonderful. They displayed a blind loyalty to certain traditions of their own as interpreted and enforced by the seniors, Avhile their respect for me, so far as all forms went, never failed, indeed, as long as my eye was upon them ; but fear was the spring of it. They understood no reason but the strong hand, and, having been well broken in to slavish obedience, had the defects of this quality and the qualities of this defect. I remember, in the first week, having to find fault with one of the elder boys for not carrying out an injunction of mine, and, to my amazement, he gave as excuse that he did not understand I meant to be obeyed, because I had spoken in quite a friendly, pleasant tone ! Another lout, Avhom I had encouraged into brief confidentiality, made bold to tell me that he, for one, would hate to be a schoolmaster, unless for the fun of thrashing the boys. That was their idea of education ! Through some inscrutable necessity in the nature of things, I was put here to have my innings against them with the time-honoured bat ; then their business was to bowl me out as often as possible, only"], [229, "Tlie Troubles of a Tyrant. 217 under-hand bowling was not thought well of, and they made no complaint whenever I managed to score fairly off them. It was different when I set about introducing science lessons ; then they kicked against a yoke which custom had not made tolerable. They did not grumble much about being kept to Virgil and Euclid \u2014 that was according to the good old rule and simple plan of the scholastic game ; but they stubbornly resisted such neAV-fangled obligations. Perhaps we expected too much, though my wife and I were quite prepared for a good deal of uphill work. We proposed to carry out our reforms by degrees, not playing the part of new brooms too stiffly, yet meaning to sweep clean in the long run. We began by trying to make friends Avith the boys, but it was some time before we could wear down the friction of our relations to the desired smoothness. These lads received our advances so shyly that patience was a virtue much forced upon us ; and if the reader will be kind enough to imitate our example, I should like to tell him some of the troubles which we had to encounter. The first nuisance was of a zoological character. My predecessor had been an old bachelor ; that was well seen. So long as his boys left him in peace, he did not mind how much they turned the house into a bear-garden. Dirt and disorder seemed to have been the rule for years back. There was quite a mania among the boys for keeping animals of one sort or other, and I found myself presiding over a very menagerie. One of"], [230, "218 A Schoolmaster's Stories. them had an owl, which found quarters in the lavatory; another a tame squirrel; half a dozen entertained rabbits in the playground ; no less than three kept dogs, Avhich furnished frequent bones of contention between them and the servants. One of these dogs from the first showed a most dogged and undissembled aver- sion to me. I could tell a queer tale about that dog if I liked, but I pass it over for the present. Another boy had a private cat, which picked up its own livelihood mainly among a colony of white mice that from time to time had escaped to run wild through the premises. I never could be sure that any desk or play-box did not contain a litter of kittens. I suspected ferrets. A certain eccentric genius cherished a snake, Avhich he had a way of wearing round his neck like a collar. The same boy was found to have his play-box \u2014 not to speak of his pockets \u2014 full of natural history specimens in various stages of decomposition, including a mole's skin imperfectly cured, and a sparrow which he had been attempting to stuff. The pigeons, the birds in cages, the aquariums, were too numerous to mention. We were once woke up in the middle of the night by a great barking and chasing, which, on inquiry, turned out to be connected with the getting loose of a tame hare. And I had to interfere very decidedly when one youth, of an experimental turn of mind, proposed to collect, train, and maintain a company of performing fleas ! Such was the Augean stable, the cleansing of which made our first Herculean task. We thought"], [231, "The Troubles of a Tyrant. 219 Avell to deal gently with this difficulty, tenderly to wean the boys' affections from their incon venient pets, skilfully to persuade them that so many animals could not find place to advantage in such a large household. They were, however, as slow as some grown-up communities to accept the lessons of political economy, so in the end I had to take the matter up with a high hand and make a clean sAveep of the whole collection \u2014 except one licensed dog, henceforth entertained in a public capacity. To make up for this act of despotism, my wife and I presented them with a library of useful and amusing volumes, containing illustrated natural histories, narratives of travel in the lands of the lion, the tiger, the gorilla; exciting stories of contests with panthers, grizzly bears, Red Indians, and other wild animals. The boys were hardly satisfied Avith the exchange, but they had to be, and time healed the Avound of parting with their feathered and four-footed favourites. Next there broke out an epidemic of cooking, the results of which all householders may imagine. The nuts that were roasting, the apples that were baking, the sausages that Avere always frying at the dining-hall fire, the cheese that was toasting in the candles, the coffee that Avas boiling over the gaslights in the passages at the most objectionable hours, became a nuisance. My wife felt justly offended at the reflections thus appearing to be cast upon her dietary. We did our very best for the money \u2014 the greedy monkeys had pudding three times a week, and cake for tea on Sundays."], [232, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 220 Noav, they actually carried off their helpings of meat on the sly in handkerchiefs to make pies with \u2014 such pies ! The servants grumbled ; the boys would come running into the kitchen and pantry, to borrow means or beg materials for their illicit banquets. The much-enduring youth who acted as boots of our establishment was kept trotting at all hours down to the town on this or that commission, when he ought to have been more usefully employed. Small boys Avere sent out of bounds, too, to purchase comestibles, their sneaking employers not caring to run this risk themselves. Since \u2014 so we are informed on high culinary authority \u2014 you must catch your hare before cooking it, some of the sucking Soyers, as Sam Weller might have called them, were tempted into a reprehensible practice of \"going tick \" at \" grub-shops.\" Then, of course, they made a great mess about the fireplaces and else where, and one stupid fellow nearly contrived to set the house on fire in concocting some or other abomination, while another burned his hands badly Avhile making toffee. Other untimely feasters Avere found making a night of it in their dormitory, where I appeared among them like the ghost of Banquo. Taking these facts into consideration, I felt myself called on to prohibit \u2014 or at least to restrain \u2014 such amateur culinary operations, a measure that Avas not carried out without a considerable amount of popular disapproval. In all states, especially of Anglo-Saxon race, the licensed"], [233, "The Troubles of a Tyrant. 221 victualling interests are a tender point to touch. These boys seemed to think I played a tyrant rarely, and sighed, no doubt, for the good old days when they were alloAved to follow their own sweet wills, dabbling in grease and gravy to their hearts' content. Repressed at this point, the playful versatility of youth soon found a new pastime, still more objectionable, and yet one that called for more delicate handling. This time it was all our OAvn fault. We presented a rather Avheezy old piano to the boys' dining-hall, hoping thus to encourage in them a taste for music. We did encourage such a taste Avith a vengeance; then, like the hero of Frankenstein, shrank in horror from that monster we had called into blatant life. Straightway, I Avill not say music, but noise became the rage among our young gentlemen. They had just come back from the holidays, and, their pockets being full, found themselves in a position to patronise the arts. None was so poor as not to treat himself to a musical apple, out of money so far well employed that he had something to show and sound for it. One started a concertina, and, as if that Avere not enough, this same boy became the proud master of a banjo; another got an out landish instrument, knoAvn, I understand, as the zither ; a third began to learn the fiddle more devotedly than had ever appeared in the case of his Euclid; a fourth took to beating the drum with zeal worthy of a better cause. More than one had flutes; the whistles, pan-pipes, jew's-harps,"], [234, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 222 and such-like were innumerable \u2014 not to speak of other extemporaneous and home-made instruments ; while any boy who could no otherwise contribute his part to the general din, felt himself called upon to thump the forms with a stick or bang the poker and tongs together, with an effect more suited to some band of demon-cavalry than for a not very large house. There was a clever fellow who even invented, as he claimed, a new musical instrument. He filled a number of tumblers with Avater to different heights, and struck them with a knife, so as to call forth varied sounds supposed to form a tune. In the excess of his enthusiasm he broke a glass one day while playing \" Rule Britannia,\" and had to pay for it out of his pocket-money. We had him there ! The taste of the young performers Avas of course questionable. Mr Herbert Spencer tells us very truly, that the undeveloped ear is most tickled by percussive strains. \" When Music, heavenly maid, was young,\" she may be supposed to have affected a loud, striking, and simple style of melody, such as that in which the negro Apollo must have been a master; and so it Avas with our tuneful ones. They Avere continually strumming those popular airs that the advance of civilisation had last brought doAvn from London upon strolling barrel-organs ; they screeched out incoherent ballads about \"Old Bob Ridley,\" or \"The Coal Black Rose \" ; they mangled \" The British Grenadiers,\" and mocked \"Home, Sweet Home\"; they joined in deafening choruses, whereof we,"], [235, "The Troubles of a Tyrant. 223 shuddering in our own apartments, caught nothing but some such refrain as \"Yah, yah, yah !\" They invited us one night to a concert, the great feature of which Avas Avhat the programme called a \"Dutch Symphony.\" This phrase turned out to imply that everybody played Avhatever tune he pleased upon any instrument in his own time and key at once, each performer trying his best to make as much row as he could, and the main body of the audience assisting with promiscuous discords pro duced in all imaginable ways. Before the Dutch Symphony had half ended, my wife's voice was heard, \" shriller than all the music,\" declaring that it Avas too much for her feelings, and I Avas obliged to rise and beg the orchestra not to overpower us with their moving strains. Yet this was but a concentrated essence of what went on from morning to night in our establishment. We were very thankful nobody thought of trying the bagpipes ! It was growing beyond a joke. I, indeed, did not so much mind it, unless I happened to have a headache \u2014 a thing that must happen often to a man who has to stuff Greek, Latin, and mathe matics into some forty urchins, by no means \" feeding like one.\" I am free to admit that I have no ear for music, a defect in my composition for which I am rather grateful than otherwise, as it seems to save me from a good deal of annoyance, ill-temper, and uncharitable judgments of my fellow-creatures.

Shake speare, being a man of sense, never said anything of the sort. What he did say was, \" A man that hath no music in himself\" \u2014 the man for whom music must be made by means of fiddles, trom bones, lutes, organs, fifes, tambourines, and so forth \u2014 such a man is fit for murders, treasons, stratagems, if you like, while to be envied and trusted is he who, in his own breast, enjoys the chords of continual harmony. That is my view of the matter; and being thus happily constituted, I am able to tolerate any reasonable amount of noise that gives profit or pleasure to my less fortunate fellow-creatures. But it is otherwise Avith my dear Mary; in this respect we were like Jack Sprat and his wife. She has really a passionate love of music, and a fine ear, which receives such a shock from a false note as mine does from a false quantity. The charivari performances of our boys were so real a torture to her, that I Avished to put a stop to them once and for all. But she, just like her, begged me to let her bear Avith it, if possible ; she would fain fly for refuge to her own piano, striving to drown the boys' performances Avith \"music sweeter than their own.\" She did not Avish her fastidious taste to stand in the Avay of their enjoyment; she would try to endure the pain like a schoolmaster's wife, always looking forward to the joyful change of those intervals, when \" Silence, like a poultice comes To heal the blows of sound.\""], [237, "The Troubles of a Tyrant. 225 Brave little Avoman ! But I would not permit her to undergo such martyrdom. We argued the matter out, and agreed that Ave Avere justified in considering ourselves as well as our pupils. We had recently been reading a popular book called Helen's Babies, which seemed to teach that, in future, elders were to demean themselves with a respectful regard for all the whims and fancies of the youngsters they might have charge of. Surely this is asking too much. Grown-up people are fairly entitled to have their peace and comfort Aveighed against the capricious tastes of the young; and in measuring out justice to the latter, it may be taken into account how easily nature allows them to be happy. A boy's will is the Avind's will, and there is far less harshness in diverting him forcibly to a ball from the inconvenient joys of a penny trumpet, than in subjecting his parent or master to a headache, Avhich is not only a pain in itself, but may be the cause of pain in others. I mention these considerations to show that I did not act without reason; a despotic master Avould have put down the thing at once, of his own mere motion, without more ado. I accordingly took measures to bring this musical furore under regulation. Any boy, Avho was statedly and studiously learning an instrument, had ample licence for the practice thereof. The rest were given one hour in the day, when, and when only, they might have their own sweet will, an hour at Avhich Mary was generally out. We invited them to take this time for screeching P"], [238, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 226 themselves hoarse, and twanging, tooting, or thumping themselves deaf. What was the result ? As with the celebrated singer mentioned by Horace, whereas before they had never been Avilling to leave off that din of theirs at any spare moment, so now there was not a chirp to be got out of them. That hour, in which the musical babel had leave to break loose, was the quietest of the day ; and the whole orchestra of flutes, concertina, banjo, drum, Avhistles, and so on, was henceforth as mute as the \"harp that once through Tara's halls,\" etc. Jew's-harps became a drug in the market; one of the flutes Avas dismounted to be converted into a pea-shooter or something of the sort; the zither was SAVopped for a penknife with two blades and a broken one; and when our first baby came to be born, the owner of the banjo very kindly offered it to my Avife as a christening present. These plagues and the cure of them must be understood as extending over some considerable time. I have been simply presenting some of their ludicrous and trivial aspects, so that all this chapter may go as a mere prelude of drum and pan-pipes to a more stirring performance. Having thus set up my show, and, as one hopes, got an attentive audience about me, I am going to exhibit in dramatic detail the story of one of the first hitches in my Avork of reform ; and from one the intelligent reader may learn the nature of all."], [239, "\"CAVE!\" I. THE first year of my provincial headmastership was naturally the most fruitful in troubles entailed upon me by my predecessor's \" inactivity,\" \u2014 a charitable term of reproach which I adopt from the mouth of the bishop of the diocese. For years I kept coming across dry bones and fossils of his period, a single one of which often enabled me to construct mentally his whole system of discipline : the boys had had to present themselves Avith more or less punctuality at certain hours, to handle certain books, to take a thrashing at uncertain intervals, when their old Gamp of a master was \" so dispoged \" ; the rest had been largely laissez faire. This hireling teacher had too evidently aimed at combining the minimum of trouble with the maximum of stipend, and naturally left his school very much out of joint, for me to set it right. But it was during the first few months that once and again I had almost broken down before the stumbling-blocks, the faults of omission and 227"], [240, "228 A Schoolmaster's Stories. commission, the conservative prejudices against Avhich I had to make head, for some time to little apparent purpose. Probably I was not judicious enough in my innovations : I know I tried to do too much at once, like the monkey with the nuts, and I think I made the same mistake as another potentate flourishing at that period, Napoleon III., in somewhat suddenly transforming an arbitrary despotic system into one aiming at constitutional government. Mary, who is the milk of human kindness itself, but whose ideas of management are naturally taken from the nursery, would have it that I erred in lack of surveillance and severity upon occasion. But I expounded to my inconsiderate helpmeet that vain laws are no good without morals ; that enlightened treatment goes below the symptoms to deal with the cause of disease ; that fruitful change must be a matter of organic growth ; that good discipline should inform a school as a chemical, and not a mere mechanical mixture ; that you drive out nature with a stick to no permanent effect ; that the results we hoped for were to be fostered only by care and patience, and not by such active remedies as enfeeble the constitution in the long run, having always to be administered in increasing doses to purge the humours of a depraved habit, \u2014 in short, that health is strength, and not weakness. My theory was sound, and my illustrations were excellent ; in the irritating friction of daily practice, hoAvever, I fear that I did not always bear in mind my"], [241, "\" Cave !\" 229 own maxims, but too often applied rule-of-thumb palliatives and stimulants to the symptoms of my little body politic. The above medical metaphors are not inappropriate to the course of this story, as Avill be seen Avhen Ave reach it by-and-by, Avhich cannot well be done without a full diagnosis of predisposing causes. The result of this state of things for me was a crop of constant petty worries that would have destroyed the equanimity of a tortoise, far more of such a thin-skinned and by no means eupeptic person as myself. It is all very well for kindly theorists to prate about appealing to the reason or right feelings of boys ; I should just like to see such philosophers put for one day in charge of a small country grammar school. The old doctors of dis cipline were quite as far out in appealing at every turn to the rod, by which in the end they only challenged daring spirits and callous skins to defy them. But, Avherever you have a flock of thoughtless youngsters to keep together and drive to naturally undesired pastures, somebody must somehow do a good deal of shepherding, which will largely consist of prosaic and vexatious incidents ; then, if the wilful sheep let themselves be fed to no visible fattening \u2014 \" Alas ! what boots it, with incessant care To tend the homely slighted shepherd's trade ! \" Thus I who had taken a second in moderations, I who had once hoped to be a minor Dr Arnold, I who might feel as capable as another of writing"], [242, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 230 upon the doctrine of the enclitic de, I Avho had actually published essays on the theory and practice of education, found myself condemned to a round of irksome duties which were partly those of a Brobdingnagian nursery-maid and partly of a Lilliputian police-magistrate. All day I slaved away at the Sisyphus stone of my pupils' ignorance; then no small part of my leisure time was taken up in cutting off the Hydra necks of my boarders' stubbornness. I had no real helper but Mary. At that time there was not even an assistant-master living in the house. I did make a futile attempt to work the monitorial system, but gave it up in despair, finding my senior boys not old enough, and not sufficiently removed from their fellows in interest and sympathy to play the prefect over them. The very servants seemed to be in league for the cause of irregularity and disorder. There was no one I could trust throughout my little state to aid me in carrying out its laws. All my subjects were united against me as the common tyrant. Pity the sorrows of a poor young head master ! I was, of course, a headmaster in a very small Avay, yet still an undoubted head ; for, besides occasional visiting teachers, I commanded the services, such as they were, of- one regular assistant, living in the town, Avho had filled that position long before I came into office, and, to tell the truth, was less of a help than a hindrance, since it might not be said of him that \" gladly would he learn and gladly teach.\" So the best part of my energy was perforce spent in"], [243, "\" Cave ! \" 231 administering questions of pedagogic mint and anise and cummin. I could well understand in those days how an Irish official must feel. That predecessor of mine had ruled, so to speak, at the point of the cane; he had made strict laws, which Avere broken as often as kept, and inspired fitful terror by arbitrary gusts of punishment, accepted as fate rather than desert, like the storms and floods of nature. I had from the first granted concessions and privileges, only to find them abused ; I aimed at a mild and equitable but firm government, that secured at best a sullen conformity. Do what we could for those boys' comfort and welfare, they were always laying their heads together Avith our silly old housekeeper, left us as another unwelcome legacy from the ancien regime, lamenting Avith her over the good old days when their master thrashed but did not lecture them, and Avhen no \" meddling mistress \" came \" poking about the place\" to see that things were managed properly.

I am not sure whether"], [244, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 232 a population of lazy lazzaroni would care to change their Bombas for the rule of any enlightened sociologist. It was for no want of trying that I did not win the boys' confidence. I began by playing at their games with them ; but I had to give that up for a time because my mere presence too plainly cast a shade over their enjoyment. The reader Avho has been admitted to see me in the dressing-gown and slippers of my mind, so to speak, does not know what a grave and sober character I can be in the way of business. If I did condescend to be facetious and friendly with those urchins, it only tempted them to take liberties ; their humour and mine were not tuned on the same key. They would treat me as a master, and would not be friends as well as subjects. They had clearly been in the way of looking on a schoolmaster as a kind of licensed ogre, who had a right to as much obedience as he could get out of them, but to not a particle of their trust or respect out of school hours. \" Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes\" was their motto. They sniffed at my suspicious favours, and distrusted my novel professions of goodwill. Very likely I did not go the right way to work ; but my position was certainly a difficult one. It went to my heart to note how, at the sight of me a hush would come over their careless mirth, and how the warning cry of Cave ! would often be raised as soon as I appeared spying about their proceedings in schoolroom or playground. Spying"], [245, "Cave ! \" 233 they called it, Avhen all I Avished was to have nothing to spy upon. That Avord cave became an abomination to me; and I threatened severest penalties against whomsoever I might catch using it. Much good I got by this prohibition ; they gave up crying cave, and agreed instead to call out Bo! as the sign of danger, treating me as if I had been a goose. I have found it a fault in some masters of the new school that they are too ready to hunt after popularity, a thing that to be a sound acquisition must come unsought. But mine is not one of those hard natures that can stand stiffly inde pendent of others' good-will ; I am as sensitive as a professional thought-reader to the unspoken criticism of those with whom I have to do. So, before the first year of my school-keeping was out, I had Avorried and fretted myself into an un wholesome frame of mind, in Avhich every little annoyance of my duties rankled so painfully that I grew to hate the very sight of a boy. I Avas always fancying some slight or sulkiness, where perhaps nothing of the kind existed ; I read gloomy omens in the most ordinary looks and tones; I conjured up spectres of wrong-doing that existed only in my own imagination. The boys' natural antipathy to the restraints of discipline I interpreted needlessly as a moral biting of their thumbs at me. Even their awkward observances and perfunctory politenesses were so much matter to feed my hungry suspicion of repressed hatred. To me their conduct seemed to be inspired by two"], [246, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 234 alternate moods \u2014 one in which they exhausted all their juvenile ingenuity to put me out of temper ; another in which, for a change, they conspired to be monotonously blameless as if to spite me by giving no occasion for finding fault. My brother Busbies will no doubt have noticed that school discipline often exhibits this alternation of every thing running suspiciously smooth for a time, then everything going wrong, down to the liver of the master \u2014 an illustration of Mr Herbert Spencer's law of rhythm which I suggest for the next edition of his First Principles. On the other hand, my brooding spirits could not find comfort in observing real progress made ; I forgot Dr Arnold's sensible illustration of a ball kicked on twenty yards which comes back nineteen, but one yard is gained : my attention was too much fixed on the lost nineteen. Dear Mary took a more cheerful view, and was always trying to make me see the bright side of our work, as is her hopeful way. But for her, I verily believe I might have thrown up the game, ceased trying to improve matters, and contented my conscience with thrashing some half-dozen offenders at random once a Aveek or so. And these wretched boys actually sulked at her for a time, fancying that she was the Jezebel Avho stirred me up to acts of irksome oppression ! Uncon sciously they adopted the tone of French cynicism, whispering among themselves Cherchez la femtne ! at every disagreeable crisis. If any of our idle young pickles ever gets the length of Avriting a story of school life, I fear I may figure therein as a"], [247, "\"Cave!\" 235 kind of uxorious, not to say henpecked, Herod, who might not have been such a bad fellow were it not for influences always at my elboAv. It may be supposed hoAV longingly we expected the Christmas holidays, to give us a relief from these cares of miniature state. So did the boys, for their own part. They had certain curious customs belonging to this season, rites to which the young monkeys clung as piously as if their school had been an Eton or a Winchester. The antepenultimate Sunday of the half was known among them as \" Button \" Sunday, because then every one of them pulled a button off his jacket on the way to church ! Next Sunday was \" Rag\" Sunday, Avhen in like manner they all made a tear in their handkerchiefs, \u2014 symbolic survival, as I conjectured, of a former more complete destruc tion, though other students of juvenile mythology have objected to my hypothesis that in those ancient times boys had probably no handkerchiefs to tear up. The last Sunday was \" Cock-hat day,\" on which they wore their hats with an air of jaunty triumph, as who should say that deliver ance was now at hand. On the last day of all, they held it a duty to break a fixed quantity of crockery, the memory of our matron running not to the contrary of this savage practice, whose origin, whether sacrificial or otherwise, I refer to the consideration of Mr E. B. Tylor, or Professor Max Miiller, only barring any reference to the solar myth theory, since these were emphatically deeds of darkness. At the time I had no heart"], [248, "236 A Schoolmaster's Stories. for any such anthropological inquiries, too anxious to get over the breaking-up, with all its riotous incidents. At last the boys got gleefully aAvay, and Mary and I, no less glad to see the backs of them, had some quiet Aveeks to prepare ourselves for the next campaign. We went into Avinter quarters at Brighton \u2014 but my audience may be growing impatient. Here Ave are, pages and pages behind us, and not into the current of the story yet. I can only plead in excuse the example of Balzac and other masters of the art of fiction, who often prove a little tedious just for the first chapter or so, not to speak of that German novel which had run far into its second volume before diligent readers arrived at the verb. Schoolmasters, indeed, by dint of having to hammer things again and again into the heads of their pupils, are apt to acquire a someAvhat diffuse style of their own. And, to tell the truth, now that for once I have got hold of a grown-up class to listen to me, I do not find it in my heart to part with them till I have poured forth all my troubles at length, hoping in their sympathy to gain some \"sweet oblivious antidote.\" Bent on keeping as far as possible abreast of the spirit of the age, I took occasion of these first holidays to have some of the big bare dormitories fitted up with rows of neat cubicles after the modern fashion. I expected to propitiate my boarders by this regard to their comfort. Will it be believed that they chose rather to resent the change? On coming back to school,"], [249, "\" Cave ! \" 237 they sniffed over the unaccustomed accommoda tion with as much suspicion as the Trojans showed at first of that fatal horse, contemptuously reviling the cubicles as \" loose-boxes \" and \" dog kennels,\" after their bucolic ideas of metaphor ; then it cost I know not how many scoldings and punishments to get the rule observed of keeping each to his own compartment. When I went round the rooms at night, my approaching foot steps were pretty sure to start a batch of youngsters bolting like so many rabbits from the coverts Avhere they had been making friendly but illicit visits, instead of getting quietly tucked up in bed. If not closely looked after, too, they would exchange cubicles for a night or two, to have the chance of a chat with some crony over the partition wall. By such aberrations they meant no great harm ; but all schoolmasters will understand and appreciate my reasons for insisting on the neAV order of things, quite inconsistent Avith the simple arcadian manners and more or less innocent irregularities that had hitherto prevailed. Poor Mary found her troubles also. She had undertaken the portfolio of sanitary affairs, as to Avhich there was much room for reform. Under the regime of that snuffy bachelor, my predecessor, there once had not been such a thing as a bath-room in the house : the only way a boy could have a bath if he wanted one, would be by lying down in a kind of trough in the back court and getting someone to pump over him ! In the"], [250, "238 A Schoolmaster 's Stories. restored schoolhouse buildings, Ave, of course, had bath-rooms, a well-fitted lavatory, and other much needed improvements. But, as the proverb says, it is one thing to lay on any amount of hot and cold water to your premises, and another to make the inmates thereof use it for more fitting purposes than splashing, squirting, and spilling in those rude experiments by Avhich tAvelve-year-old urchins take such interest in testing the properties of fluid matter. In the old days, we were informed, it had become for a time a favourite adventure among the boys to take that pump-and-trough bath, as being a thing forbidden and therefore desirable; but, now that proper baths were provided them, they showed no such zeal for the proper use thereof. In the summer, indeed, just when their out-of door bathings rendered it a work of supererogation, they were Avilling enough to make any amount of mess in the bath-rooms, but, when cold Aveather came they were found to fight more shy of whole some ablutions. My wife had to take the matter up, for there was nobody else to look after them but a fussy, soft-hearted, weak-minded old matron, who had not authority enough to make the smallest imp among them wet the tip of his nose, Avhile we could not find the heart to send her off after a quarter of a century's incompetence. So Mary drew up a regulation, appointing the hour when each boy in turn should take a bath once a week. Then there was the difficult and delicate matter of seeing that they did it ; and the excuses, the"], [251, "Cave ! \" 239 evasions, the goings out of turn, the general slackness of obedience, Avere so provoking, that, with all her kindliness, Mary saw nothing for it but to call in the secular arm, that is mine, to deal with her contumacious heretics against that text defining the proper position of cleanliness in the moral scale. It is all very well for a schoolmaster to play the bugbear ; but the worst of it was that, through these necessary prosecu tions, my kind-hearted wife appeared to the boys in the character of an oppressor at second-hand, \"Avilling to Avound and yet afraid to strike,\" and passed among them for inciting me to such deeds of severity as, at my hands, seemed only natural. I am dwelling so much at length on these troubles, that we shall never get to anything like a story unless I at once introduce some personage as a peg to hang the plot upon. So at length I plunge my hand in medias res and pull out a queer character called Worsley, known among his schoolfellows as \" Moses,\" from an unlucky slip he once made in the genitive of 7110s. He was a lean and hungry creature, this Worsley, Avith a queer squinting look that made you never quite sure Avhether or no he was laughing in your face. He belonged to the genus clever idle boy, with a special turn for slyness and shiftiness. His people at home used to write us that he \" required encouragement,\" whereas we opined that snubbing was Avhat he rather needed. I vaguely suspected him of being at the bottom of a good deal of the opposition to my measures ;"], [252, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 240 but he was too crafty to be often caught tripping, and habitually posed as a juvenile Pharisee of austere good conduct. It would, perhaps, be nearer the mark to say that he loved to hover \" on the perilous edge of things,\" sailing as close to the wind of obedience as possible Avithout being taken aback, and enjoying the sport of provoking me not quite to the point where I might have an excuse for coming down upon him. His schoolfelloAvs mostly acted heedlessly according to their nature ; but Master Worsley, if I mistake not, was a cold-blooded malcontent, who aspired to the palm, not the pang, of martyrdom, and had astutely taken the measure of my fidgety, well-meaning unmasterfulness. To hear him talk of his motives, he had an angel's wings sprouting under his jacket. To see his conduct, however, one was reminded that \" a lie which is half a truth is ever the blackest of lies.\" He had a fine, glib, plausible way of expressing surprise when you ventured to suspect him of the least dereliction. \" I, sir ! \u2014 I assure you it is a mistake \u2014 I never would think of such a thing,\" \u2014 the impudent humbug ! He gave me more worry than any half-dozen of the rest, and yet I seldom could succeed in proving a clear case against him. Had he no other escape handy when taxed with idleness or inattention, he Avould usually fall back on a convenient headache or sore throat, or some thing of the kind, and turn the edge of my reproof by presenting himself to it as a helpless object for pity."], [253, "\" Cave ! \" 241 Here Avas another constant source of doubt and vexation for our inexperience. These boys were always catching cold or some other slight ailment, and one never felt quite sure how much or how little to make of it. We had often reason to suspect that their illnesses were, in a large degree, rather subjective than objective. Was going to school upon the mildest winter day in question, coughs all at once became severe, which strangely yielded to the bracing treatment of playing in chill winds or slushy snow. On a Avet Sunday, the Avhole house Avould be crowing like a poultry show; but most of the patients made a rapid recovery as soon as prospects of skating came in view. What Avith reckless boys Avho, being really ill, Avould not take care of themselves, and cunning ones whose only complaint Avas an indisposition to work, we had a hard winter. Our old goose of a matron had been in the way of letting any boy stay at home who liked to come to her; then her course of treatment was stereotyped: senna tea for stomach-aches, gruel for colds, and two pills of a certain well-advertised kind for any other case that could not be more readily diagnosed. Finding that it was a case of vult decipi with the old lady, I formed Mary and myself into a court of appeal on such questions, thereby adding to our troubles. Worsley, for example, would have spent half his time in the sick-room, if all his claims to such indoor relief had been granted. Well, winter had passed away with its due pro portion of frosts and rains, giving place to that Q"], [254, "A Schoolmasters Stories. 242 deceitful spring of whose gentleness, \u00e6thereal mildness, and so forth, we hear such fine tales from the poets. One bitter Thursday morning, when I could feel the east wind both in mind and body, even before having been out-of-doors, as we Avere all on the point of rising from breakfast, Mary jogged my memory as to a little report she had seen cause to make to me. Wednesday afternoon was the appointed time for Worsley taking a bath, whereas he showed a preference for the date of the Greek Calends ; and it had come to her knowledge that the towel put out for him still retained its maiden purity, convicting him of a neglect for which he must noAV be called to account \u2014 such were the prosaic daily details of our standing in loco par en tis. I called him up forthAvith to answer for himself, as he did, of course, with his usual smug air of overdone deference. \" If you please, sir, I meant to speak to you about it. The fact is, I was unwell yesterday, and I don't feel very well to-day.\" \" So,\" said I, giving him a searching look, intended to pierce to his conscience, but he met it unabashed \u2014 \" and Avhat may be the matter this time? Xenophon to-day, isn't it?\" \" No, indeed, sir; that has nothing to do with it,\" he answered, with a fine affectation of hurt feelings. \" I think I must have caught a bad cold. I feel feverish and all-overish like \u2014 worse than I was last time ;\" and, as if inviting corroboration, he squinted"], [255, "Cave ! \" 243 round at some of the other boys in a way Avhich I took for a wink. \" You are always catching cold,\" I cried, rather peevishly, I am afraid, Avhen I ought to have been dignified and judicial. \" I am sorry, sir, to be so delicate ; it is not my fault,\" he said gravely, and I sat rebuked, debating Avith myself Avhether or no to give him the benefit of the doubt. \" Well ? \" I asked, after an interval, determined at least not to fall an easy victim to his designs, though of course I knew what was to be the sequel at the heels of this feeling all-overish. I glanced aside at Mary, and could see that she, for her part, was not prepared to take the responsibility of dis crediting his statement. \" I thought, sir, you would not mind my staying in this cold day. I daresay I shall be better to-morrow.\" And therewith he gave a sepulchral cough or two, as if to move my compassion. \" You shall not be better to-morrow ! \" I burst out with such sudden vehemence that the boys, who were trooping away from table, stopped to listen, nudging aud signalling to one another. \"To morrow you expect a holiday ; to-morrow you think there will be a paper-chase; to-morrow you are to be an invalid. You may stay in the sick-room to-day, but you must go to bed at once, and remain there till I give you leave to get up. I will send you some work to prevent time hanging heavy on your hands; and you shall have medicine,"], [256, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 244 understand me, to cure you once and for all. You are to live on slops till you are quite well, and I think a mustard plaster or two would do no harm, if you feel pain anywhere.\" A meaning look at Mary told her that she should have the task of carrying out this rigorous treatment, on which we had already consulted, as an experiment worth trying in the case of such invalids as Worsley. Watching the fellow closely, I thought I could see him dismayed by the prospect thus put before him ; then, feeling half sure that he was merely shamming, and vexed by Avhat seemed his impudence, I Avas led on into making a rather foolish speech, as one often does when one speaks Avithout due consideration. \" Listen to me, boys ! There has been a great deal too much of this coughing and sneezing. Now, I will not have it; there is to be no more of it. I forbid anyone in the house to catch cold, and Avhoever disobeys me shall repent it. That will do.\" Why did I not remember the example of Canute or of Ulysses, and refuse vainly to com mand the east winds ? That very evening who but myself began to feel shivery and stuffy about the eyes, with a touch of hoarseness in the throat ! Next morning at breakfast, I sneezed, dismally several times, to the secret delight of those boys, who winked slyly at each other, and looked the chuckles to which they durst not give utterance. They thought I could not see them ; but we pedagogues see a great deal that Ave are fain to"], [257, "\" Cave ! \" 245 shut our eyes upon. It Avas well for me to have Worsley still secluded in the sick-room, so that he, at least, could not share the unspoken triumph over my misfortune. Thus bad began, but worse remained behind. Persons in authority cannot lay up like idle boys ; I Avas the driving-wheel that must keep going, greased or not, else the Avhole machine wrould come to a standstill. I Avent down to school in all the misery of a cold in the head. Then a fresh mischance came to exasperate my sore spirit. To raise the tone and style of this country grammar school, I had forbidden the boys to play marbles, and carried out among my boarders a general confiscation of such irritamenta malorum, as judged by the public school standard. That morning I surprised a party of low-minded day boys \" knuckling down \" again in the teeth of my prohibition, and under the very nose of my incompetent assistant-master, who \"didn't know he ought to interfere,\" forsooth ! I exploded; the culprits pouted; we all began the day's work in a rusty humour, and everything went out of gear, as a matter of course. At the eleven o'clock interval, some young rebel threw a marble and broke a Avindow, and I fulminated against the unconfessed offender in vain, feeling certain that it had been done on purpose and out of spite. So, when, at the end of the forenoon, a deputation of the elder boys came to ask me a favour, I flatly refused. It had been customary, I was told, to grant a half-holiday for that afternoon in honour"], [258, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 246 of certain pagan rites knoAvn as a \" bull roast,\" which took place in a neighbouring village, Avith no little scandal and riot, as handed down from time immemorial. I seized this opportunity of shoAving displeasure towards my disaffected sub- jects, and gave them to know that they should have no such relaxation till I could see the bonds of good discipline drawn tighter and worn more easily. Then arose one faint hiss from a remote corner, but I strangled the serpent of open dis- affection in its cradle, commanding sullen order with a look for once as masterful as that of any judge at the Old Bailey. The afternoon's unwilling work was more of a weariness to me than to them. Everything went worse than ever. If I had been one of the old Orbilius school, how many tender skins would have tingled from the electric discharges of that thunder-cloud which oppressed all my mind. But I kept my temper, relieving my feelings with no more potent instrument than a pocket-handkerchief. I do not say that I was not cross and perhaps a little snappish, but, if I spoke daggers now and then, I used none, and bled inwardly, as is the way with us cold-blooded introspective natures. Yet, if no boy was bodily the worse for my stifled wrath that afternoon, few could have been mentally the better for my obscured wisdom. It seemed to me that my troubles had noAV groAvn to a head, where they must be mended or ended. The gloom of my spirit was disturbed by thick coming fancies of a storm at hand, which should either clear the"], [259, "\" Cave ! \" 247 air or bring wreck and ruin, perhaps do both. I got to the point of saying to myself that it were better not to be a schoolmaster; long ago, indeed, unless Mary had heartened me ever and again, I should have been ready to throw up my arms and let these stubborn boys exult over my defeat. Habet! he has enough of it ! The remotest country curacy, I often told myself, would be a Avelcome haven after these exhausting cares of power. Oh, how wretched is that poor man who hangs on schoolboys' behaviours ! The east wind had retired in favour of more dull, muggy weather, and it began to rain as I walked home to the schoolhouse, resolving to take a blue pill and put my feet in hot Avater, and thus anon repair my drooping head. Later in the evening, Avhile \" Dreary, weary with the long day's work, Head of me, heart of me, stupid as a stone. I was sitting idly brooding over my sorrows, when I ought to have been correcting my sixth form's composition \u2014 I say composition in the singular, because the said form in my school was one and indivisible, like the French Republic, having but a single member, and him a day-boy \u2014 as I listened dolefully to a storm of sleet beating against the window-panes and making havoc among our early blossoms \u2014 (now the interest of my drama is about to thicken, so I would have no judicious reader skip these broken sentences Avith which I nerve myself to approach a gloomy subject) \u2014 as I sat"], [260, "A Schoolmasters Stories. 248 huddled over the fire in my study and had not even heart to light the gas and get to Avork, there comes me gently in my wife, at the first tones of Avhose voice I knew that something more had gone Avrong. \" My dear, am I interrupting you ? You have been worried to-day, haven't you ? \" \" Man Avas made to mourn, if he has anything to do with boys,\" I replied out of the darkness, and she drew nearer. \" I am afraid, I am going to give you more worry, but it can't be helped.\" \" ' Let me taste the Avhole of it, fare like my peers,' \" I quoted with desperate flippancy, yet anxiously asking myself what new stroke was about to fall. The house could not be on fire, at any rate, or she would come to the point more bluntly, instead of thus playing with my fears in her ill-judged care to break bad news. \" It is about Worsley.\" \" ' Well, and what imports the nomination of this gentleman?'\" I had forgotten all about Worsley for the last few hours. \" Do you know, I fancy he must be really ill.\" \"Pooh! He has been over-eating himself,\" said I, and, indeed, the youth was a very valiant trencherman ; but my heart sank as I spoke thus lightly. \" He has eaten almost nothing to-day, nor yesterday. He is feverish and has no appetite; he complains of a pain in his head.\" \" Just my case. Yet neither of us are far enough"], [261, "Cave ! \" 249 gone that Ave need sacrifice a cock \u2014 or is it seven and sixpence ? \u2014 to \u00c6sculapius.\" \" There is a great deal of scarlet fever about,\" remarked Mary, at length driven to let off her great gun, as the only Avay of stirring me into sympathetic seriousness. \"We must send for the doctor!\" I exclaimed, throwing off at once my mask of hypocritical leA-ity. \" I have sent for him already ; I thought it as Avell to make sure,\" said Mary. Then, just as happens on the stage, there was a loud pull at the door bell before we had time to speak another word. \" 'And here, I take it, is the doctor come,'\" said I, again seeking to calm her fears by the feeble jocularity of that poor humour of mine. II. THE doctor it was, sure enough, yet not the doctor we could have wished. Old Mr Payne, our regular medical attendant, had recently taken into partnership his son Samuel, dignified Avith a brand neAV degree of M.D. from a Scotch University, and chock-full, so rumour ran, of all the latest medical science, which seemed to justify him in somewhat affecting the solemn airs of a grand old-school physician. Now Dr Sam. was not a bad fellow in his way, but to me he gave the impression of having crowded on more sail of learning than he"], [262, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 250 had common sense to steer to good purpose. Dr Thomas Diafoirus I used to call him behind his back, which was not uncharitable on my part, as nobody in the town would recognise the allusion. He took a very serious, not to say glum view of his vocation, and appeared to delight in exaggerat ing the dangers of disease, in order to magnify his office as a healer. We had occasional Avalks together, when he used to make me feel quite uncomfortable by explaining, in a cold-blooded way, how I might die in a second, if only some little valve in the heart failed once to act, or some tiny clot of blood got stuck fast in such-and-such a vein. His propensity was to jump to the Avorst opinion of a case, and by his looks and behaviour, if not by words, to predict the darkest issue ; whereas that sensible practitioner, his father, who was suspected of not being very Avell up in the more recondite forms of disease, had at least learned by experience how much harder it is to die in fact than in theory, and had the way of comforting some of his patients, Avhile he offended others, by rather making light of their ailments. It was Dr Samuel Avho answered our summons, his father being away from home for a day or two, as he explained ; and Ave hailed him and his spectacles as a Avell-equipped champion to deliver us from our painful doubts, though both Mary and I would far rather have had the old gentleman. We led the way to the sick-room, Avhere even I could see at the first glance that poor Worsley"], [263, "Cave ! 251 Avas not himself. The doctor entered upon his business with due gravity and an air of portentous wisdom, turning up the cuffs of his intellect, so to speak, as if to announce to the complaint that he Avas going to begin, and that this fell adversary Avould do Avell to beware of him. First he asked us some general questions as to the appearance and progress of the ailment. Then he turned to our invalid, interrogating him with all the severity of an inquisitor, so that poor Worsley for once was rather overawed, not that he had much impudence left in him by this time. While speaking, he had been feeling the boy's pulse, now he drew forth instruments, at which the patient glanced uneasily askance, till it became clear Avhat use they were to be put to, \u2014 a stetho- scope, a pocket thermometer, a note-book, and a pair of more powerful spectacles. Worsley opened his eyes when, after an orthodox exhibi- tion of his tongue, he was told to put the thermo- meter into his mouth ; next, having taken the temperature, the learned physician sounded his lungs, looked down his throat, put on the extra spectacles to scrutinise his face and chest, and ended by poking and punching him all over, with more questions, till the boy was half ready to cry. We stood by, anxiously watching these deliberate proceedings, and I fancied I could see Dr Samuel's face growing longer and longer. Having finished his examination, he delivered himself up to a period of profound reflection ; then, after making some careful notes, he intimated to us that he was"], [264, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 252 ready to withdraw for the purpose of delivering his opinion. No sooner had Ave got him back into the study, than Mary and I opened fire upon him in the same breath. \" Well,\" said I, affecting an indifference I by no means felt. \" Anything serious ? \" \" Is it infectious ? \" eagerly asked Mary, less able to play the hypocrite. Before answering, the young \u00c6sculapius took a chair, as if to rebuke our unprofessional im patience and uphold the dignity of science. We would seem to be in for an evening of cheerful diagnosis. \" The intelligent physician,\" he began, weighing every Avord, \"seldom allows himself to arrive at a hasty conclusion.\" \" No more does any man of sense.\" I took him up somewhat sharply. \" But have you no idea what is the matter ? \" \" The symptoms in their present stage may point to several forms of febrile disturbance,\" he went on, with his provoking way of doling forth every crumb of information so as to get the most long-drawn relish out of his own wisdom. \" Is it scarlet fever ? \" asked Mary. \" Possibly,\" he replied, after a pause, as with a certain grim enjoyment of our anxiety. \" But I cannot pronounce definitely till the rash declares itself.\" The fellow, I fancy, thought it likely to be scarlet fever all the time ; but he did not care to have his important secret Avrested from him in our"], [265, "Cave ! 253 off-hand way; so, blinking solemnly, he went on to suggest. \" There is a great deal of small-pox also in the toAvn.\" \" Small-pox ! \" Mary and I looked at one another in consternation, then he gave our rack another turn. \" It might certainly prove to be typhoid. Do you knoAV if your drains are in good order ? \" \"As right as the enlightened British Avorkman can, or will, make them ! \" said I savagely. \" Are you quite sure, doctor, that it isn't the cholera, or the yellow fever, or the plague Ave have got among us ?\" \" The diagnosis cannot be made accurate until \u2022\" began Dr Samuel, settling himself in his chair as if to discuss the points I had raised ; but here fortune came to our aid. There was another ring at the bell ; a messenger had come seeking the doctor's immediate services for a case of accident, and he was fain hastily to take his leave, assuring us that he would call to-morrow and send some medicine, and that in the meanwhile nothing more could be done. His last word was ominous \u2014 \"Be careful to keep the boy separate from the rest.\" When he had gone, we came back into the study and sat down without speaking for a minute or tAvo. Our minds Avere full of the gravity of the situation. Here it was upon us, then, that possible calamity we had so often dreaded, looming all the more appallingly because it Avould be our first experience of anything of the kind. Scarlet fever"], [266, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 254 is a terrible scourge in a small school, as anyone will agree who has ever had the same responsibility. One does not know whether best to keep the boys together with all practicable precautions, or to send them home at the risk of spreading infection. Some of them were sure to be sent for by anxious parents, and day-boys would gladly seize this excuse for staying away from school. We had no means of entirely isolating cases of infectious disease ; while it was out of the question for us to move bodily, making an educational picnic by the sea, like Uppingham. The whole school could not fail to be disorganised, just as we were getting things a little ship-shape, and most of our work would have to be done over again, not to speak of the pecuniary loss, serious to a young couple beginning life. In my fits of depression I had thought of giving up the school ; now the trouble was that my school seemed likely to give up me. \" It's as bad as it can be ! \" I broke out, when Mary took my hand and tried to comfort me by saying that, after all, the case might not be so bad as we feared. We talked the matter over. On one point Ave made up our minds : that, at any cost to ourselves, there should be no attempt to hide the truth if Worsley's illness turned out an infectious one, such as scarlet fever or small-pox, but that, so long as it remained uncertain, we should keep the secret since to have the danger made public would only increase the chances of its spreading. So much"], [267, "\"Cave!\" 255 we understood and not much more as to the risk of infection in these diseases ; our sapient physician, on the policy of making a monopoly of his knoAvledge, had not clearly enlightened us as to how much should be feared, and we resolved to err on the safer side by neglecting no precautions. Fortunately, the sick-room, in which Worsley had been for the last two days, was in a corner of the top floor, quite out of the way, so that it would not be difficult to keep the other boys apart from him. Mary undertook the nursing of him ; she had had scarlet fever herself and was not a bit nervous. I don't mean to say that she would have shirked her duty in any case ; nor would I have it understood that I was unduly awake to my own danger, but the truth is that, Avhen now and then I felt a little soreness in my throat, I henceforth began to ask myself Avhether it might not be something Avorse than a cold that Avas the matter with me. And, if the boys only kneAv they had scarlet fever among them, we should soon have our hands full of real or imaginary cases. \" Be sure and go straight to bed,\" was my injunction to these youngsters on dismissing them for the night. I trusted to have broken them by this time of the habit of running about in the dark out of their OAvn rooms ; but it went to my heart to see how some of them noAV slunk off Avithout shaking hands with me, while others got through this customary ceremony as an unpleasant task, turning away their heads when they mumbled a perfunctory \" good night,\" as likely as not from"], [268, "256 A Schoolmaster's Stories. mere aAvkwardness, but I made sure that they were resenting my refusal of the holiday, and let myself be vexed by it. If they had only knoAvn what a care was gnawing in my bosom, Avhich for their sakes I must suffer and be silent ! I went back to discuss Avith Mary whether, after all, we could not possibly smuggle this invalid of ours out of the house Avithout delay ; then, a little later, before going round to see that all lights were out, I proposed paying him a visit. A word or two must here be said as to the geography of my house. The sick-room, as already mentioned, Avas in a corner of the top story, a part not otherwise occupied. It had two doors, one opening upon a staircase from our private apartments, the other on a passage running all along the floor, at the farther end of which was one of the large rooms fitted up with cubicles. The intervening dormitories stood empty for Avant of boys to fill them ; some day Ave hoped they would be full. The rest of my boarders slept on the story below. I was treading softly up the side stair, not to disturb Worsley, if he should be asleep, when I caught sight of a grey figure standing out motion less against the moonlit frame of a window. With all my nerves set on edge by the trials of the day, I confess I was at first so startled that I dropped the snuffers of the candlestick I had in my hand, and the clang in turn startled this eerie shape, \"that shape had none\"; then the"], [269, "\" Cave !\" 257 thing turned sharply round, and I saw hoAV it was a boy wrapped in a blanket. I knew him noAV for Sands, rather a nice little fellow in the third form, and my excited mind at once leaped to the truth of the case. This urchin had been placed as a sentry to give notice of my approach, and taken by the temptation of looking out of Avindow, had alloAved himself to be sur prised at his post. But Sands, recovering from his confusion as soon as myself, atoned for that neglect of duty towards his comrades by courage worthy of a better cause. He hesitated only for a moment, then, heedless of consequences, right in face of me \u2014 instantis tyranni ! \u2014 he lifted up his voice, and before flying in all haste, made the passage resound Avith a cry of alarm : \u2014 \"Cave!\" I guessed at once hoAV it was, and I had not been mistaken. Springing up the stairs, three at once, I burst into the sick-room, just in time to hear a sudden scuffling of bare feet, and to see a train of night-shirts, like the ghosts in Macbeth, vanishing by the other door. \" Come like shadoAvs, so depart ! \" Worsley was sitting up in bed, eating an orange. \" Who has been here ? \" I asked vehemently ; but next moment I saw that he could not be expected to answer such a question, and, Avithout another word to him, set out in hot chase of the fugitives. The passage Avas all silent and dark now, save where a ray of light at the farther end showed the door of the dormitory to be ajar. I R"], [270, "258 A Schoolmaster's Stories. made straight for it \u2014 All quiet ! I drew aside the curtain of the first cubicle, and found the occupant apparently saying his prayers. The next boy was also on his knees like the king in Hamlet, and thus were most of them found. One or two, indeed, had so much honesty as to have jumped straight into bed, half-undressed \u2014 an act that, to my eyes, had more relish of salvation in it. I was no Hamlet to be disarmed thus. Utterly disgusted by their hypocrisy, I could hardly trust myself to speak to the young Tartuffes, hampered, too, as I was, by not being free to explain the full cause of my natural indignation. Heedless of interrupting these false devotions, I called them out into the middle of the room, and out they all came with such conscious looks as left me no doubt. When it was put to them, they did not deny the charge. They \" saw no harm in it ; \" they never saw any harm in breaking my rules. There were seven boys in the room, some of my biggest boarders, Avho ought to have known better: all of them had been Avith Worsley, \u2014 they, and no others. So they confessed under examination, and looked for nothing less than immediate execution, as they stood there sheepishly guilty, trembling in various stages of deshabille', a sorry, defenceless crew. ' Dicite coelicolae, vos parvi, dicite, pisces, Ni tegerent bracchae crura, quid esset homo ! \" There be some pedagogues who would have painfully improved the occasion. I am not such"], [271, "\" Cave ! \" 259 an one. Self-knowledge being my strong point, I am too well aware of the difficulty of being wise, amazed, temperate, and furious all in a moment, and I make a rule of punishing no offence till one's blood can be trusted to Avait upon the judgment. But I gave those wretched, rash, intruding fools a severe talking to for the counts of deceit and disobedience of Avhich they stood convicted ; I laid home to them about their pranks now grown too broad to bear with, promising that they should hear further on the subject to-morrow, and, in the meantime, denounc ing heavy penalties against anyone who should put his nose outside his own cubicle. Having thus, as it Avere, committed the culprits for trial, or rather for sentence, I left them Avith matter for rueful reflection, if they were made of any penetrable stuff. Little guessed they my inward spite against the fates that so ordained \" To punish me with this, and this with me, That I should be their scourge and minister. ': Next, I went to Sands' dormitory. Him I found already full dressed with a view to probable con tingencies. He made no attempt at denying or excusing himself \u2014 ready, like a young Horatio, to take fortune's buffets as they came, and not let her fingers or mine sound any unworthy stop upon him. But, as he could assure me that he had not entered Worsley's room, I dismissed him to bed, unscathed for me, to be dealt further with next day. I might as well have put him out of pain at once, one way"], [272, "260 A Schoolmaster's Stories. or other : he would not know how I Avas too much taken up by the iniquity of his employers to have very severe intentions against him. After all, I rather admired his courageous fidelity, as I despised the baseness of those Avho had set him to run that risk for their own safety in ill-doing. But my principle is to pardon no more than to punish without due consideration. And, if you must know, I am like the electrical eel, which, after giving one or two violent shocks, has spent all its powers for the present. My just wrath already began to pale its ineffectual fire ; and Mary was always the source to which I soon felt the need of turning to take in a fresh current of energy. But now I had long in vain to search for my Avife through the dark and silent house. The servants and all had gone to bed, and she too seemed to have disappeared just Avhen I particularly wanted her, which helped not a little still further to chafe my fretted mood. At length I found her in the deserted kitchen, drugging Worsley's posset, like a virtuous Lady Macbeth, or like a beneficent witch, with our brindled cat mewing about her. There I hastened to let her know how \" Confusion now had made his masterpiece,\" and she was no less vexed than myself, as well we might be. For all we knew, those seven boys' untimely visit to their sick friend might prove to have cost them the scarlet fever or the small-pox, or whatever it Avas, not to speak of the danger of it spreading through their means. If they could only have seen us conspiring"], [273, "\" Cave ! \" 261 for their good at dead of night by the light of a tallow candle, all alone save for the cat and the scurrying blackbeetles ! \" I have a good mind,\" said I, looking to her to spur the sides of my intent \u2014 \" I have a very great mind to give them a sound caning all round to-morrow morning.\" \" I am sure they deserve it,\" said Mary, who, never having either endured or inflicted corporal punishment herself, Avas apt to treat such matters more lightly than I did. \" But that Avould not prevent them carrying the infection, would it?\" She spoke too truly ; this was a medical rather than a surgical case Avith which I had to deal. Then she suggested \u2014 \" Why not keep them shut up for a day or two, till we see Avhat it is going to be ? They did that at my school sometimes with the naughty girls. Nobody need know the real reason just yet, and if the fever does break out \" \"Oh, wise young judge!\" Expressing myself to some such effect, I interrupted her, in sudden admiration for this piece of woman's wit. I saw, Avithout further explanation, the force of her pro posal : under the guise of punishment, to keep our seven penitents out of the way of doing further mischief, closely confined to their cubicles till Worsley's complaint should have declared itself, or at least till we had held counsel with the doctor and considered further what was best to be done. So far as Ave knew, those seven were the only boys"], [274, "262 A Schoolmaster's Stories. who had come in contact with Worsley during the last two days ; and now we had them all insulated on the upper floor. So zealously did I enter into Mary's idea, that I at once resolved to be myself the boys' gaoler for the night, taking up my quarters in an empty cubicle in the same room, since they could not be trusted to be left alone. This Avould be such an opportunity as I had long desired for rebuking their scorn of these innovating compartments. Besides, though I kept this to myself, I fancied that my oavii symptoms, Avhich seemed as yet like a common cold, might turn out to mean something Avorse, in which case it would be as well for me to be in quarantine with the other tainted wethers of the flock. So, while Mary went to attend on Worsley, I, weary and out of sorts, was not long in returning to the upper dormitory with what I needed for spending the night there. As I entered, two or three subdued voices cried out from their beds, one leading off with a rash guess, and the rest following up his mistake. \" Is that you, Sands ? \" \" What has he done to you ? \" \"Never mind, old fellow; we'll make it up to you ! \" \" Look out he doesn't catch you here ! He's as savage to-night as an old gorilla.\" \"It is not Sands,\" said I in a boding voice, and forthAvith dread silence fell upon the dismayed band."], [275, "\" Cave ! \" 263 They might Avell be much puzzled and impressed by my proceedings, Avhen they became aware how I meant to mount guard over them. I at once Avent to bed in an unoccupied cubicle next the door, and for the rest of the night my companions kept quiet as the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, save for an occasional snore or heavy breathing, Avhich showed how their mental perturbations had yielded to the soothing touch of Morpheus. It was long before I got to sleep, tossing uneasily on my too small couch, and turning over the sorrows of school keeping in my anxious thoughts. But not even schoolmasters are Avholly debarred from \"great nature's second course ; \" and at last I too was able to steep my senses in much-needed forgetfulness \u2014 a baffled and bewildered tyrant \u2014 \" His body couched in a curious bed, Where care, mistrust, and treason wait on him.\" III. I WAS aAvakened next morning by a long unfamiliar sensation, as if some one were tickling stiy feet. Hastily I drew up my feet, and threw the counterpane off my face, looking up to con front Avho but Master Worsley, in his dressing gown, at the foot of the bed ! Still more hastily, he withdrew from beneath the bed-clothes that impious hand, with which he imagined himself to have been playing off a friendly pleasantry upon"], [276, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 264 one of his schoolfellows, and stood rooted to the floor in horrified amazement, like one who should \" . . . Unaware, Ranging the woods to start a hare, Come to the mouth of the dark lair, Where, growling low, a fierce old bear Lies among bones and blood ! \" \" I didn't know \u2014 I didn't see \u2014 I didn't mean,\" he stammered out, overcome by the awe of my offended dignity. \" Back to your bed ! \" I cried, less concerned on my own account, than for the boy's folly in thus wandering along the cold passages; and Worsley fled Avithout further parley, one or two suppressed giggles from the cubicles showing that their inmates had got some inkling of his strange ad venture. Vexatious and ridiculous at once as this visita tion Avas, it came in time to whet my somewhat blunted purpose. Seen by the light of day, I might else have given up hope of effectually keeping my boys out of the danger that threatened them; but now, while dressing, I exhorted myself to go doggedly through with the plan of insulation, shrinking from no measures which might be need ful to let all concerned know that I must be master in my own house. My cold Avas rather better this morning, so I began to hope that, after all, it might turn out we had been frighted with false fire, especially since Master Worsley felt well enough to run about the cold passages."], [277, "\"Cave!\" 265 Proposing presently to commend him to Mary's increased vigilance, I addressed the subdued and astonished seven collectively \u2014 it Avas, by the way, rather awkward work making a speech to an audience hidden away behind separate partitions and curtains, \u2014 informing them that they Avere to be confined each to his cubicle for the rest of the day. Their meals should be brought up ; and I Avould set them some work to do while the rest of us were at school. To make sure that they did not give me the slip for a moment, on leaving their room, I locked the door and took the key in my pocket. How shall I tell all Ave got through that wretched day ! As arranged the night before, Mary had sent for the school-porter, who was now placed on guard over the prisoners, with strict orders not to let them communicate with anyone. Their solitary confinement was to be varied with half-an-hour's exercise, taken by turns, in the deserted play ground. In the afternoon I relieved guard for a time, Mary meanwhile scouring the town in search of some empty furnished house, which we might make into an hospital, if need Avere. I pressed that hypodidascalus of mine \u2014 since the Avord usher is now obsolete \u2014 into playing gaoler in turn, a service to Avhich he consented very ungraciously; so, by way of appeasing him, I had to let him know Avhat reason Ave had for such measures, upon which he threw cold water, asserting scarlet fever not to be infectious in the early stages. Then Mary thought well to take the matron into"], [278, "266 A Schoolmaster's Stories. confidence; and she, on the other hand, enlivened us with garrulous anticipations of evil, and cheerful reminiscences, from her own experience, of the havoc which dire diseases can make in a school. With all the fuss that was being made, we could not hope to keep the secret of our prison-house much longer. The other boarders were deeply impressed by my unexampled exercise of high-handed authority, and treated me with much observance all school time. But this seemed little good to me: it was their sympathy and confidence I wanted, not mere dread. I made sure they Avere looking on me as a tyrant for inflicting that unconstitutional punish ment on their schoolfellows, who would hold themselves as much wronged by imprisonment as a French lyc4en by a flogging. It Avas spmething at least that they should learn to fear, even if to hate me, as in the case of Louis Napoleon and his Parisian malcontents after the coup d'etat. I noticed Avith suspicion that an unusually large proportion of the day-boys were absent; could the report of our misfortune have already gone abroad? If it had not been Saturday at any rate, I should certainly have found some excuse for giving a half-holiday. In the afternoon I had cause to think I had done well in putting those boys into quarantine. Two of them eat next to no dinner, and asked leave to go to bed, without, as yet, any more decided symptoms than those of a cold. I should like to have gone to bed myself, but there was"], [279, "\" Cave I \" 267 no such luck for a sneezing and sniffing despot. Towards the evening I did give myself leave off duty for an hour or tAvo, going down to the news room to get a look at the weekly papers ; but neither my beloved Spectator nor all the art of the Saturday Review could calm that troubled breast of mine. And, as I was walking home, a fresh annoyance came to rankle in my mind. A dirty street-boy, having placed himself at a corner, whence he could make a speedy retreat, sent this rhetorical question after me, winged with all the loudness of vulgar impudence : \u2014 \" Ya, ya ! Avho has put the grammar-school lads into quod ? \" Of course I passed on without taking any further notice, but the shot had gone home. So the story of my strange apparent cruelty had spread over the tOAvn, and old and young tongues would be at Avork misjudging and backbiting me! I knew that this vulgar urchin was no more a representative of his fellow-citizens than a fit judge of my con duct, and I might have guessed that it could be only by accident that he had picked up such a lump of moral mud to hurl at me, after his kind; but none the less it stuck in my susceptible feelings, and left a bruise. No philosopher can be more thoroughly convinced than I am, that the man just and firm in his purpose should not let himself be moved by any \"quips and sentences and paper-bullets of the brain\"; and yet I confess to much sympathy with that fabled miller who, in the matter of his ass, was so sensitive to every"], [280, "268 A Schoolmaster's Stories. expression of public opinion. That is where un philosophic, mud-throwing boys have such an advantage in this life; they do not care a farthing what anyone thinks of them; but I do, and even a street-boy's light-feathered shaft can pierce me like the sting of a mosquito. So I am; alas, that I am so ! I came home at gloomy nightfall to be met by more bad news. In my absence, the doctor had been and gone, still Avithout giving any decided opinion. But since that, young Sands had com plained to Mary of not feeling well, and she packed him off at once to bed in our spare room. So, after all, it might turn out that my quarantine arrangements were to no purpose. Still, we could give ourselves the assurance of having done every thing in our power, like those Italian officials who, mounting guard against the cholera, did not omit to fumigate even a waggon of chloride of lime. Later in the evening, another boy announced much the same symptoms, Avith an alarming addition of bleeding at the nose. The epidemic, then, was having free course, and we almost lost heart to fight it. The boys themselves must by this time be suspecting something wrong; at all events, they were unusually quiet, as if conscious of the shadow of coming evil. We made up a bed for this one in my dressing-room, and that was all we could do, except send begging another early visit from the doctor. Our hospital accom modation Avas now exhausted. Our old matron,"], [281, "\" Cave ! \" 269 overcome by agitation and constant trotting up and down stairs, had taken to her own. bed ; Mary had to be ministering angel in general. Worsley seemed so much worse since his escapade of the morning, that I half thought of sending a telegram to his father. I had heard of cases of death from scarlet fever in forty-eight hours. He appeared to be slightly delirious ; his eyes were almost bunged up ; and. bluish blotches had broken out on his face and hands. We spent another miserable night. Next morn ing our Avorst fears seemed justified. A rash had shown itself on the faces of all the patients. Noav Ave should be put out of suspense. Mary was at early service this Sunday morning when the doctor came. To my great satisfaction, it Avas old Mr Payne this time, who, as he explained to me, had reached home late the night before, having been at a famous horse-fair and bought himself a remarkable cob, on whose excellencies he would expatiate at tedious length, gossiping too about the weather and the state of the country, just as if it were an everyday matter to have half-a-dozen cases of contagious disease in your house. At length I got him into the room Avhere Sands was, wishing to show him this patient first, since he had the rash most distinctly developed. Even, then the old gentleman put off time by chaffing with the boy in a humorous way he had, asking him when he had been caned last, and such like"], [282, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 270 questions on what are now considered delicate subjects, not lending themselves to such rough pleasantry as in the days of a past generation. Sands answered with a faint grin, looking dubiously aside at me when mention was made of chastise ment, as if not quite sure whether that bitterness were past for him, after what had happened. I thought the doctor Avas never going to get to business. But when he did, turning Sands' chubby face to the light, while I stood restlessly by waiting for his verdict, without more ado he gave it in one word \u2014 \" Measles ! \" \" Measles ! \" echoed I, with a sudden sense of relief. \" Undoubted measles. There are half-a-dozen cases among your boys in the town.\" I don't know why I should have felt so light hearted, as if a burden had fallen from my back, like some criminal who, expecting ruinous imprisonment, hears, hardly able to believe his good luck, that he is to get off Avith the option of a fine. Measles are bad enough, but they may pass as a merciful visitation compared to scarlet fever or small-pox. The doctor went round to see the other patients, and there were several fresh ones ripe for him this morning, but in every case he was able to say without hesitation that nothing but measles was the matter. After releasing my prisoners from their quarantine seclusion, I went nearly half-way home with him, eager to meet Mary and communicate the good"], [283, "\"Cave!\" 271 neAvs to her ; then she joined with me in almost Avelcoming this less malignant disease as a deliverer from the shadoAvy bugbear that for two days had been hanging over us. When measles come into a school, they are apt to come, not single spies, but in battalions. The infection had been at Avork before ever we suspected it. On Monday nearly a third of my boarders Avere down Avith the complaint. But we were prepared to meet the invasion. The largest dormitory was quickly cleared out, and turned into a hospital ward, Avhere for the next two or three weeks Mary had her hands full in tending this sociable company of invalids. It so happened that, as our good star would have it, most of those taken ill were just the most troublesome subjects, Avhom I could best have spared for a time from setting a bad example : the measles had folloAved for me the counsel of Tarquin in temporarily mowing down the rankest Aveeds of this hard patch I had to hoe. So, while they lay at my Avife's mercy, I was able to get the rest of the school more under my thumb ; and, when the Easter holidays came, notable progress seemed to have been made in making the rusty old order give place to new. The worst of it Avas that my sixth form must needs go and catch the com plaint, a clever tOAvn-boy, the teaching of whom was my one cheering oasis in a desert of mere rudimentary gerund-grinding, thickly strewn Avith the bones of intractable irregular verbs and ill-used subjunctives."], [284, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 272 In the meantime, Mary had her sweet will of that coddled crew in the sick-room, and, if you knew her gifts for such a task, you would understand that she soon taught them to look upon her with more friendly eyes, and no longer to misjudge her as a tyrant in petticoats. One touching incident I may mention to show a sense of gratitude. When Sands was getting better, his people sent him a shilling in stamps to buy a new prayer-book with, his old one having been put into the fire by some over-zealous alarmist against infection. He asked Mary to perform this commission for him in the toAvn, which she duly did, getting twopence discount in the shilling from our bookseller. On her giving him these coppers with the book, he took them awkwardly, and, after a moment's hesitation, emboldened himself to whisper to her with simple sincerity \u2014 \" You have taken a great deal of trouble \u2014 won't you keep the change for yourself, please ? \" \u2014 then, a moment afterwards, was evidently distressed by recognising that he had made a mistake in his well-meant intentions. Most of the parents, too, expressed themselves as grateful to us \u2014 the least they could do, seeing that their sons' illness spoiled our Easter holidays for us. Some of them went so far as to give a present to that matron of ours, who had done little for the patients, except try to stop up all ventila tion in their room, and keep them depressed by Cassandra-like prophecies of dangerous sequel\u00e6. With Worsley's people, hoAvever, we had some"], [285, "Cave!\" 273 unpleasantness : they tried to make out that we had not taken proper care of their darling, and removed him soon afterwards. I cannot say we Avere sorry to lose him \u2014 but it was ever thus ! We never felt any particular interest in a boy, or were at any special trouble about him, but he Avas sure to be taken away from us for some reason or other, generally to be sent to a larger school. Sic vos non vobis ! The measles, after all, did us no great harm. I wish I could say that we as soon got quite over that state of chronic suppressed inflammation which had been set up between my pupils and me. I do not blame them so much as the long neglect that had left so much rust for me to rub off as soon as possible. The fault, indeed, Avas partly my own, since I have an awkward knack of handling the burden of authority so as to challenge criticism. \" A schoolmaster,\" say as certain author, \" should have an atmosphere of awe about him, and walk Avonderingly, as if he were amazed at being himself.\" I can command no such imposing demeanour. It was then the harder for me to overcome the inert resistance offered to my innovations by the very order of things rather than by any special malice on my boys' part. It is their nature to cling to custom, from which a rougher hand than mine might have torn them away more readily, perhaps not with such good result in the end. My difficulty lay precisely in this \u2014 that, whereas it came more natural to me to play the reformer than the tyrant, I had to act both parts at once, no easy task, as s"], [286, "274 A Schoolmaster's Stories. Sir Wilfrid Lawson would find out if ever he got his way. \"Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg, Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good ! So, for long, these boys continued prone to see with a jaundiced eye Avhatever I did for their Avelfare \u2014 a mood of theirs which could hardly fail to react on an archangel's temper. I might fill a dozen chapters with illustrations of their pig headedness, such as I propose eventually to embody in my work on the History of Scholastic Discipline. On Wednesdays and Saturdays, for example, they had been allowed to go down town after dinner to spend their pocket-money. Not to break in upon the cricket and football, Avhich it was my policy to encourage, I shifted this hour of liberty to between twelve and one. How did the young Tories take it ? They actually spread a calumny that we sent them out before dinner on purpose to have them stuffed with cakes and sweets, on the stick-jaw principle, so as to save our joints! Then, to bring the matter under due regulation, we licensed a certain deserving and trustworthy person to set up a stall in the playing field, whereupon the keeper of a shop, which seemed like to lose a good part of the boys' custom, inspired them to look upon me as a sleeping partner with this monopolist of mine, who for some time was boycotted by influence of the elder fellows. It was still worse when, to stop the frequent"], [287, "\"Cave!\" 275 breakages and other damages to our stock-in-trade, Avhich they brought about with a light heart, I made a law that all such mischief, the authors being undiscovered, should be repaired at the common expense; and the consequent taxation of their pocket-money was voted clear tyranny, very nearly causing an open rebellion. The fact of our introducing a cold dinner on Sundays was made another grievance, though we gave them pudding three days a week in exchange. They took to the pudding kindly enough after the second or third time, but not without a determined effort on the part of the leaders of the opposition to have it looked on as an accursed thing, who actually succeeded in tabooing, under the op probrious name of \"fly pudding,\" a certain com position of currants and suet, their refusal of which proves that we did not stint them, at any rate. Thus, in important and indifferent matters alike, they looked askance upon any attempt to alter an established decree, an order to Avhich they had grown used, though against it their predecessors had no doubt once protested as an unwelcome novelty. I must not end in this grumbling tone ; for, if I had time, I might tell of better days, when we became adjusted to our environment, and our juvenile environment grew to be more in harmony with us, both parties discovering the better points of each other. \" In time, the savage bull doth bear the yoke.\" My liberal institutions gradually got established as matters of course, and the boys"], [288, "276 A Schoolmaster's Stories. in the end shoAved themselves just as conservative on the new lines as on the old. So that my successor, if he be a progressive educationalist, may at first find no less difficulty than I did, in performing the part of Headmaster at once with ease to himself and profit to his pupils."], [289, "A DEED WITHOUT A NAME. I. I TRUST not yet to have exhausted the reader's sympathy under the troubles which fell upon me when I became Head of a provincial grammar school, like some lieutenant from a ship of the line taking command of a petty gun-boat. Dante was needlessly harsh, placing his old schoolmaster in a place of future torment; we have our purgatory in this world. Bear with me if I now relate another ordeal of such obscure martyrdom, after, as usual, abusing your patience by a page or two of preliminary disquisition. In entering upon my new duties and responsi bilities, there was one important matter on which I had always put off making up my mind, to wit, whether or no I should permit myself to use such means of chastisement as have from time imme morial been considered peculiarly appropriate to schoolboys, and in the days of our fathers formed perhaps the most striking feature of school life. Times have changed ; and if the rod still flourishes more or less vigorously at some of our old public 277"], [290, "278 A Schoolmaster's Stories. schools,\u2014 flourishes is hardly in the word, for even there, to quote Shakespeare, it \"becomes more mocked than used,\" \u2014 elsewhere it proves to be in every sense of the word a sore subject. Many schools, indeed, appeal, with great success, to that class of parents whom old Fuller calls \" cockering mothers,\" by undertaking that in the discipline of their sons there shall be \" no corporal punish ment.\" My predecessor, following the traditions of a past generation, had by all accounts been somewhat too free in promiscuous and extem poraneous correction with whatever instrument came handy. This was looked for at his hands, and had been taken not altogether unkindly; a certain rough and ready severity had seemed to befit the character of that scholastic fossil. But I had been given to understand that I was expected to do my spiriting more gently, as quite fell in with my own wishes. I didn't like the idea of beating boys, and I hoped to be able to do without it. A great many opinions have been put forward on this vexed question; I should like to mention mine, which is a striking and original one, though, by the way, Sir Roger de Coverley has hit upon the same phrase before me. I think that \"much may be said on both sides.\" Do I approve of this kind of punishment ? Truly, in respect of itself it is a bad thing, but in respect that it may have wholesome results, there is reason in it. In respect that it is short and sharp and soon over, I like it very well ; but in respect that it causes an honour able body of men to be the theme of sorry jests"], [291, "A Deed without a Name. 279 and ludicrous associations, it is a very vile punish ment. In respect that it saves a great deal of trouble and talking, it fits my humour well; but in respect that it is apt to beget anger and ill blood, it goes much against my stomach. The Avorst of it is that the dominie's, like the dyer's hand, is apt to be subdued to what it works in; whereas, to quote from Burton, that arch-quoter, \" There is a great moderation to be had in such things, as matters of so great moment to the making or marring of a child.\" To be serious, \u2014 for after all this is no joking matter, certainly not for one of the parties in terested, \u2014 I think on the whole that a judicious and moderate use of the bugbear in some form or other might be a good thing for most schoolboys if it Avere not a bad thing for many schoolmasters. The rationale of the matter I take to be as follows. In the management of schools, it is necessary to forbid many things wrong in themselves, and other things wrong because they are forbidden. Juvenile human nature being prone to such things, we must have some force to act contrary to the bent of a boy's disposition. The force that can act effect ually thus with the least Avaste, wear, and friction, is the best adapted for its purpose. Your boy, left to himself, does not willingly enter into the advantages of punctuality, subordination, method. You appeal to his reason, to his right feeling. The appeal will not be made in vain : I am speaking, it will be noted, of an ordinary boy and commonplace offences, not of reformatory"], [292, "280 A Schoolmaster's Stories. discipline and juvenile criminals to be dealt Avith through shame and fear. Things must be bad with him, if he would not like to fall in with the injunctions of an authority which, on the whole, he recognises as beneficial to his best interests. Then comes the weakness of the flesh, tempting him to lie in bed, to neglect his lesson, to break his neighbour's windows or whatever may be the form of transgression. You have to apply some spur to his conscience. This spur may take the shape of confinement, of hard labour on some literary tread mill, of short rations, of a dozen ingenious penal devices. It may also be brought to bear in the way recommended by Solomon, though, as has been shrewdly remarked, Solomon did not recommend the rod till he was himself groAvn up out of its danger. Now French and other foreign youngsters are understood to be of such nice sense of honour that they Avould rather pine in a Avhite-washed dungeon than submit to the indignity of a blow. But the British boy is, or has hitherto been so constituted that in nine cases out of ten the smart of his skin is not felt to be a brand upon his free soul. He takes rather a painful pride than other wise in being flogged, if he be able to stand it like a man and a Briton. Custom has even been known to make such inflictions for him a property of as much easiness as is possible under the circum stances. Custom, indeed, goes for much here : in one school, boys will submit to such chastisements as a very Squeers Avould not venture upon, yet will rise in arms at the indignity of an illegal cuff. Any"], [293, "A Deed without a Name. 281 spite that may remain behind with the sting works itself off sooner in most cases than the grudge kept raw by more galling forms of punishment. It has been found possible to conduct these matters of business Avith a certain amount of good humour on both sides, at least Avithout much rancour. Most boys of average fortitude, if they could consider the choice calmly, would probably prefer to take a reasonable thrashing and get it over \u2014 if they would not, they ought to. There is many a groAvn-up man who wishes he could compound at such an easy rate for his sufferings in the world's great school \u2014 \" The vultures of the mind, Disdainful Anger, pallid Fear, And Shame that skulks behind.\" There is no shirking these castigators. Gout, rheumatism, toothache, neuralgia, too! \u2014 we are all scourged sooner or later for faults that may be our own, and may be those of our fathers. So it is not amiss that a boy should learn betimes to set his lips tight and try not to flinch when he encounters some adverse Fury or just Nemesis bearing, after all, no very deadly weapons. One doesn't care to see a youngster making too much fuss over the slings and arroAvs of outrageous fortune, or con ceiving of his honour as a thing to which all the Squeerses in the Avorld can do violence. Such is my old-fashioned theory, but I confess I would rather find somebody else to put it into practice."], [294, "282 A Schoolmaster's Stories. I have a great deal more to say on this subject, if I Avere Avriting a folio volume or so. I have entered into it at some length, because it soon became for me a question of practical politics. As I found that these new boys of mine did not readily enough answer the helm of my rule, I began to ask myself if I had done well in altering all at once the steering apparatus. The worst of accustoming a body to any stimulant or narcotic, is that you have not only to go on increasing the dose to produce the same effect, but that you cannot always leave off the use of the drug except gradually, so doctors tell us. \"Old massa always whipped me; I an't used to work, unless I gets whipped,\" said Topsy quite gravely to Miss Ophelia. Some such un spoken sentiment I fancied I could read behind the demure faces of my pupils when I too often had occasion to rebuke them. I had been speaking daggers, as it were, but using none. It Avas not that they Avere rebellious, only careless ; they would listen Avith much respect to all I had to say, then go and do the same thing again. So I was obliged to give them a great many lines to write, a Avay of sparing the rod which certainly is apt to spoil the child's hand. Perhaps, I thought, if I Avere to form just a few lines on somebody's skin, to serve as copy to the rest, it might save a good deal of time, ink, and paper. To cane or not to cane, that was the question. There was a certain Deed, a trivial-sounding matter, yet not unimportant in its bearings upon the general good of the school, which I had"], [295, "A Deed without a Name. 283 distinctly forbidden, but which nevertheless the boys kept on doing. I won't mention Avhat it was; schoolboys may guess for themselves; and older readers who have forgotten the routine of school discipline, might accuse me of making a great cry about not so very much wool. No such critical sense Avas developed in my boys; they Avere perhaps not unwilling to meet my views ; but the forbidden practice, harmless enough in itself, had become so much a habit with them, that they could not all at once break themselves of it. \" Please, sir, I forgot,\" would be the frequent excuse, which I accepted over and over again as sufficient. It Avas rather more provoking when the culprit put on an injured air, with, \" Mr Grove always let us do so and so.\" At length I began to lose patience about it. If I strengthened my prohibition with a severe penalty, this would probably put a stop to the thing once and for all. So, one morning, feeling, I fear, rather cross because there had been a fire in the town the night before, which most of the day-boys had Avelcomed as absolving them from the necessity of preparing their lessons \u2014 being, as I hint, throAvn off the usual balance of my judicial mind, and having brought up before me a fresh case of disobedience in this matter, I issued a formal proclamation that the next boy caught doing such and such a thing, should be treated as drums and dogs and bad boys are often treated. The word Avent forth irrevocably, and I must stand by it if put to the test."], [296, "284 A Schoolmaster's Stories. This announcement caused no little sensation, and for nearly a week the offence, so far as I could see, was as carefully avoided as a red-hot poker. I was congratulating myself that my vigorous action had taken effect, when on Saturday after noon my assistant-master came Avith a report that the order had once more been disregarded. He was a bumptious and ignorant young man, this assistant of mine, an unwelcome legacy from my predecessor, making up only by conceit what he Avanted by experience, and wholly without that tact which might have taught him when to see and when not to see what was going on. The Thing, I believe, had been dying out of itself, when that meddling Dogberry of mine must needs be so superfluous and officious as to bring this case of it under my notice. What could I do ? \" There would be an end to all discipline,\" as my old headmaster used to say, if I did not carry out my threat against the offenders. For there were two of them, that was the worst of it, who had been caught in a double handed transgression. It would never do to alter a decree established. 'Twould be recorded for a too pregnant precedent, and many an error by the same example would creep into my small state. Most reluctantly I prepared to do my disagreeable duty. So now, at last, after so much preliminary explanation and argument \u2014 \" The actors are at hand, and by their show, You shall know all that you are like to know.\""], [297, "A Deed without a Name. 285 \" Tell Adams and Gerand Primus, I want to speak to them before tea,\" I said to one of the boys Avho happened to come in my Avay. They had probably gone out for the afternoon by this time ; but this was a kind of passing the Rubicon. I Avould not be understood to accuse myself of infirmity of purpose, yet it must be confessed that in me the native hue of resolution is someAvhat sicklied o'er by the pale cast of thought, which is not to be counted as indecision so much as Avidth and versatility of mind ; a man Avho sees only one side of a question, can easily make his choice of courses to follow. Now I had fired the train, and there would be no getting off the explosion. And yet the Doge of Venice was less urgent Avith Shylock to tear up his cruel bond, than I in trying to find myself some excuse for not exacting this extreme penalty. If I could have picked out the criminals, there were no other two for whom I would not rather have chosen to act as executioner. These were both boarders of mine, and I had hitherto had no fault to find with either of them. Adams can only be described as a very average sort of boy, a country parson's son, in whom I had noticed nothing particular, unless perhaps a certain frank bluntness of manner. As Horace tells us, it is Avell for the boy and man Avho, in passing through school or the world, can thus escape being conspicuous. Gerand's was a more peculiar case. I had in the house three of his family, two brothers and a cousin, whom"], [298, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 286 schoolboy wit had not failed to christen Di, Do, and Dum. This Gerand, though the oldest of them, had the part of Dum in the trio, and the epithet seemed only too appropriate. He was actually the biggest boy in my school; yet, owing to an illness or to natural stupidity, he held a lower place in it than either his young brother or his younger cousin. His body seemed to have flourished at the expense of his mind, and this monster of sixteen or so actually sat dunce among the urchins of the second form. His stupidity was equalled only by his good-nature ; with his enormous bulk and awkward limbs always growing out of his clothes, he had great round patient eyes like an ox, and an expression of perpetual placidity on his broad dull face which it did one good to look at. Everything he ate Avent to flesh, giving no nourishment to his brain, it Avould appear. His motions, too, were all deliberate and ungainly; my Avife compared him to a tame and contented elephant ; a few years later he could hardly have failed to be called Jumbo. In spite of all these deficiencies, he was well-liked among the boys, and, so far as one could see, too little troubled with any sense of shame as to his low place in the school. Taking pity on him, I had promised myself, as soon as I found time, to see if nothing could be done in the Avay of private lessons with this dunce so long stuck fast in the mud of Latin grammar. He had one talent, by the way, for music, in which my wife declared that he made up for his other"], [299, "A Deed without a Name. 287 shortcomings. His behaviour in all respects was simply a pattern. If all boys were like him, all the rods, canes, straps, and such like in the world might have been made into hoops and kites long ago. Such was the boy whom I had now pledged myself to punish for Avhat after all Avas no such great sin in itself. It was not the size of him that I felt afraid of, but his meekness, his innocence, his helplessness. \"Take any shape but that ! \" With mind ill at ease till this painful ordeal should be over, I went out for a solitary walk, my custom always of a Saturday afternoon. Generally this stroll was a refreshing time for me, when in the open air I could wipe off all the dust of school hours. But now, as the crown of the week's worries, I had to charge myself like a Leyden jar Avith official indignation, to be dis charged in sparks as soon as I could get into communication with these young conductors. Did they know of the shock that was in store for them ? If so, they could hardly be more appre hensive than I who had to administer it. It was no use my telling myself not to think about it;. I could think of nothing else. The business indeed was one not to be under taken without some forethought. A man may be a surgeon without having ever been called on to perform any amputation. In all my years of assistant-mastership, I had naturally not had occasion to exercise this ultima ratio of peda gogues ; we always kept a piece of heavier calibre"], [300, "288 A Schoolmaster's Stories. for that work. I was provided Avith the necessary apparatus ; my predecessor in fact had left behind him a small museum or arsenal of appropriate implements ; but I had to work myself up to the point of using them. Since the days Avhen I myself played truant and whipped top, I had never beaten so much as a donkey with my own hands. Those instincts which had happily slept from boyhood's hour, were hard to awaken. With all this cowardice, I felt like a man appointed tp lead a forlorn hope: the sooner it could be over the better. Well does Shakespeare tell us how hideous is the interim between the acting of a dreadful thing, and the first resolve to do it. Surely these boys would not have disobeyed my orders if they had but thought Avhat a punishment was in store for \u2014 me ! On Saturdays, for various domestic reasons, my Avife and I, instead of our late dinner, had an amphibious meal known as \" high tea,\" to which Mary usually invited two or three of the boys, by turns, in the view of seeing them more intimately than we could at their own table. This Saturday, our tea had to be early, as Ave Avere going to an amateur concert in the Town Hall given by a local musical society ; Mary indeed Avas to be one of the performers ; so my walk did not last long. When I came home, I heard the piano going loudly in the drawing-room. That was well ; it would keep my wife from seeing or hearing any thing of the tragedy about to be enacted. Hastily I repaired to a little room known as my study"], [301, "A Deed without a Name. 289 having sent a boy to summon the two victims before me. While waiting for them, I put the last touch to my determination. After so much anxiety, I felt as if I could go through the ordeal with a fairly good grace. I had kept my feelings sim mering all the afternoon, now I had only to bring them to the boil ; the rest Avould be mere muscular effort. It occurred to me to put on my cap and gown to help off the scene with a more imposing aspect ; I should be like a judge in his criminal robes and black cap. Then I waited. How that time went on crutches ! I have waited on similar occasions, when my part was not to be an active but a passive one; I have waited in the ante-room of more than one dentist ; I have waited for the post when I Avas in love, but I don't remember ever waiting with such impatience as for the appearance of these two condemned boys. What could they be about ? Could they be artfully padding themselves like German students preparing for a duel ? But they should find I understood such tricks ; I had not spent six months at the University of Wurzburg for nothing. Did the young rascals know what I was enduring on their behoof? Why didn't they make haste and get it over at once, as I so much desired to do for my own part ? Here was the axe, so to speak, on the block, and they showed themselves in no hurry to come to execu tion. Did they propose to resist my authority? Were they perhaps vowing, like the scoundrel in T"], [302, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 290 Measure for Measure, that they Avould not be thrashed to-day for any man's persuasion ? Ha ! that opposition would give me the very spirit I lacked. At length, unable to bear such suspense, I went to see Avhat this messenger of mine could be about. I met him returning with the news that Adams and Gerand were nowhere to be found. What could this mean? The hour had passed when every boy was bound to be in ; were they adding offence to offence ? I proceeded to look for them myself, in the school-room, in the lavatories, in the playground, all over the house. On Gerand's bed I found his clothes lying, thrown down there in haste, it would seem, if ever poor Dum could do anything in haste ! An alarming thought came to me. There were Eton scholars in Roger Ascham's days who, as that Avorthy heard, \"be run away from the school for fear of beating.\" Could it be that my delinquents, getting a hint of what was in the wind, had taken a similar course of escaping from this difficulty? If so, what a nasty paragraph there might be made of it in the local newspaper. The Radical editor of that organ kept up a weekly growl against everything connected Avith church principles or sound learning ; and he Avould surely not let slip such a chance to hold me up before the public as a monster of cruelty. What would their parents say to me? And the poor boys themselves \u2014 I had never meant to drive them to this !"], [303, "A Deed without a Name. 291 Full of such fears, I hastened to take counsel and comfort from my wife. But as soon as I opened the door, I saw she had guests. The very boys I Avas hunting for had here found asylum ; in their best clothes and apparently quite at their ease, they were playing a duet together at the piano. I knew not whether to be more relieved or disgusted at this discovery. \"I heard you say \u2014 didn't you ? \u2014 that you wanted to speak to Adams and Gerand, so I have asked them to spend the evening with us,\" said Mary, casting an eye of surprise at my scholastic array. To this, what could I say but that I was glad to see them. The boys rose up from the piano, smiling as boys who knew well that they had got into clover for the evening. \" They are both very fond of music ; and I have told them we can take them to the concert to-night, if you don't mind,\" went on Mary Avith that gentle look that Avould disarm a rugged Russian bear, that look which is common with her, because she always wears it when she is doing or thinking of some kind turn to somebody. \" Very Avell,\" said I, trying hard to smooth the frown from my face, and to dissemble my real feelings. Then I retired to the study to take off my cap and gown, and to reflect on the peculiar aspect which the situation had just assumed, while the two boys, sitting down again to the piano, went"], [304, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 292 on calmly with their duet. Never Avas I so little merry on hearing sweet music. \" Alas ! regardless of their doom, The little victims play.\" These notes sounded terribly out of tune with the stern facts of their case. For the present they had taken sure sanctuary at the altar of domestic love, decked out for the sacrifice too in their best suits \u2014 how could I drag them forth from that SAveet priestess's shelter? Yet do not suppose I relented in my dread purpose. I could easily have forgiven them, but not myself. This Avas the first time; if I yielded now, it would not be the last. None of us know our own faults too well. \" I may be stupid and ugly,\" said the donkey, \" but at least I have a beautiful voice.\" If, however, I have not greatly misjudged myself, any want of decision in me is but as to incidents of detail, while my Avider grasp seldom fails to prove firm enough in the long run. What I had to do was only adjourned to a more fitting occasion ; at any cost to my own feelings, it would have to be accomplished sooner or later. Was the accident of my Avife's good nature to rob justice of her lawful prey ? Certainly not ; these lads themselves would be the first to despise me for such weakness. Whatever his wife might say or do, C\u00e6sar himself must be constant as the northern star. My cause would keep, and my wrath, already grown cold, must be kindled anew at some other time. In the meamvhile, as there Avas nothing else to be done, I went back to the"], [305, "A Deed without a Name. 293 drawing-room, and addressed myself to the heavy task of entertaining these unwelcome guests Avhom my wife had forced upon me Avith such good inten tions. Like Hamlet I must wait my hour, but like Macbeth \u2014 \" I am settled and bend up Each corporal agent to this terrible feat. Away, and mock the time with fairest show: False face must hide what the false heart doth know ! \" II. TEA being announced, we went into the next room and sat down, a snug family party. The table was spread with good things, hashed goose, sardines, cold apple-tart, toast, cake, muffins and marmalade, all which my young friends partook of with great gusto, unconscious of the sword of Damocles suspended by a hair over their heads. After the school-room routine of roast meat and thick bread with thin butter, such luxuries are not to be despised by boys boarding at forty pounds per annum. These two, then, like sensible fellows, laid themselves out to make the best of an oppor tunity that couldn't be expected to come round more than once a half or so. But it was far otherwise with me, their host, determined not to eat my own words with any sauce that could be devised. I felt like a con scientious Macbeth entertaining Banquo and Duncan at once. How presently should I have"], [306, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 294 the heart to take them \" grossly, full of bread \" and jam \u2014 my bread and jam ! Adams entered into conversation with me in his usual frank and fearless way, unsuspiciously telling me of a little nutting excursion he had had that afternoon. Dum, true to his nickname, said little, but devoted himself to the eatables, munching slowly, contemplatively, thankfully, like a contented cow chewing the cud, at peace Avith itself and all the world. The more I looked at his placid face, the more he reminded me of the gracious Duncan, and all his virtues seemed to plead trumpet-tongued against the dessert I had in view for him. There was another still grimmer story from the history of Scotland which Avould occur to me. Was it not King James II. who invited the terrible Douglas to a banquet at Stirling Castle; then, at a certain stage of the entertainment, suddenly a black bull's head was set on, the signal of a shameful death for that too confiding guest ? Every time I raised the cover cf the dish before me to help these hungry boys, they were aware of nothing but the disjected members of a goose with gravy and stuffing, but I, so to speak, saw the bull's head shaking its gory locks at them. If they could have seen with my eyes, Avhat digestion Avould have waited upon appetite ? I myself had little appetite; every mouthful of muffin was like to choke me; I sat glum and stiff at the head of my oavii table, trying in vain \"to smile and smile and be a villain,\" while aAvaiting some fit moment to draw the cork of my"], [307, "A Deed without a Name. 295 bottled-up displeasure. My good wife noticed that something must be the matter with me. She asked if I had a headache. In truth, I might have said, I would I were a little sick. But I had to assure her there was nothing wrong, and making an effort like Mrs Dombey, bid her fill full a cup of tea, that I might drink to the general joy of the whole table. Like Mr Pecksniff, too, I even took a biscuit and looked around me, inviting all present to be merry. In over-anxiety to act my part as the genial host, I went so far as to make a foolish jest about Gerand's sitting dumb, at which he smiled feebly, and Adams grinned from ear to ear. But I felt angry with myself a moment after, for it seems to me taking a mean advantage for a great man to crack rude jokes on his dependants, Avho can't give it him back in his own coin. Mary Avas the very reverse of a Lady Macbeth ; I could look to her for no spur to prick the sides of my intent. She rather, for the nonce, resembled the Ogre's wife who, in the story, aids and abets rascal Jack under her husband's very nose. The boys had given me up as being out of humour, and were chatting Avith her in such friendly con fidence as she is skilled to excite. Every word stuck a dagger in me. The prattling of the Babes in the Wood did not more move the heart of that softened ruffian ! Each moment my repugnance grew, while my purpose held as firm as ever. For all my feelings about it, I Avasn't going to let L dare not wait upon I would, like the poor cat in the adage we have heard of. I must be cruel"], [308, "296 A Schoolmaster's Stories. only to be kind. Pleasant or unpleasant, I durst do all that might become a schoolmaster. I had classical precedents to guide me, as the cases of Manlius Torquatus and of the Dictator Papirius, on which I had so often commented to my pupils. There should be no needless delay either. The stern duty must not be left over Sunday. How could I go to church and sit like the Village Blacksmith among my boys, with such a stroke of work undone ? No, I meant to earn the night's repose, playing the self-tormentor not an hour longer than I could help. \" If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well It were done quickly.\" At length the meal came to an end : I think I never saAV a boy take so many pieces of cake as that Dum, and consume them, one after the other, with such a deliberate relish, a linked sweetness too long drawn out for my patience. \" Pleased to the last, he crops the flowery food, And licks the hand just raised to shed his blood \" Have some more, Gerand ? \" I pressed him, with hypocritical hospitality. \"No, thank you, sir; I have had quite enough,\" he answered after due reflection. Our guests thus having done with the desire of meat and drink, we all rose from that treacherous feast, and my wife went upstairs to put on her things for the concert, promising to be only ten minutes. A lady's ten minutes meaning always"], [309, "A Deed without a Name. 297 rather more than less, now was the time for their mauvais quart d'heure. Adams very politely opened the door for Mary, then turning to me, he said \u2014 \"Would you like me, sir, to fetch you some of these ferns we were speaking about ? I know where I could get some next half-holiday \u2014 it is only four miles.\" This Avould never do. If I got talking to him in this strain, he Avould aAvake my mercy which lay dead. There Avas nothing for it but to be sudden and despatch. Off Avent the mask ! \" I have something to say to you two,\" I began Avith an abrupt sternness that at once, like a killing frost, nipped the root of their enjoyment, and scattered, like a biting wind, the blossoms of their brief prosperity. Mary's smiles were as the sunshine which had given place to the manifest cloud of my displeasure, and thus in an instant was the summer of their content made gloomy winter. There could be no mistaking my tone, yet it seemed to strike them with surprise rather than with the start of \" a guilty thing upon a fearful summons.\" As they followed me across the passage, I knew that they must be looking at one another behind my back, each mutely asking the other, and his OAvn conscience, what this might portend. No soothsayer was needed to bid them beware the omens of the coming interview. I could almost fancy them whispering \u2014 \" Look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on C\u00e6sar's brow ! \""], [310, "298 A Schoolmaster's Stories. Alas ! the angry spot would glow elsewhere before I had done with them. . In silence I led the way into my study, like a modern Medea taking off her children to be terribly dealt Avith, not before the public. I shut the door, turned up the gas, and took a judicial position on the hearthrug, affecting a calmness which I by no means felt. The boys placed themselves behind the table, standing there like prisoners at the bar. I sought courage by trying to recall the masterful air with which my late headmaster would have demeaned himself in similar emergencies, as well as the manner in Avhich, during the afternoon, I had settled to act this part ; but it was hard work blowing up the ashes of former fires. Then I cleared my throat and began, coming at once to the point. Had they done so-and-so ? Let Gerand first answer for himself. Dum opened his eyes even wider than usual, and a blush overspread his harvest-moon countenance, but he did not speak for a moment. It was not that he wished to shrink the truth ; his wits always worked slowly, and had indeed to be wound up, as it were, for each occasion, before pointing to any conclusion. \" Yes, sir,\" he said at last. \"Adams?\" The squall having struck his consort first, Adams had gained time to make all taut, so as not to be taken aback when it reached him. \" Yes, sir,\" said he with smart promptitude."], [311, "A Deed without a Name. 299 \" You knew that this had been forbidden ? \" \" Yes, sir,\" they replied as if singing a catch, Adams leading off, and Dum taking up the tune after him. \" You heard what I promised to do to the next boy Avho should break the rule?\" \" Yes, sir.\" Here they drew a little closer together as if mutually seeking moral support. I thought of the young Princes in the Tower, but steeled my heart. Their acquiescencewasnotaltogether satisfactory. I had half hoped to find them entering into argu- ment on the point, or putting forward some foolish excuse which might have given me the cue to lash myself up to such a degree of warmth as Avould make my task easier. But since they took it so calmly, I had to confine myself to cool reason, roaring as gently as any sucking dove. I delivered them a short speech in justification of what I was about to do ; it must have sounded much like an apology. I dwelt on the offence, the thing that shall be nameless here ; did they but reflect how silly was the thing, and how little good they got from the thing, and how much harm I had seen come of the thing, and how unwillingly I prohibited the thing, yet all the same was determined to put down the thing, then they would appreciate the force of my displeasure. When I assured them that this punishment would hurt me as much as it did them, they listened with the usual polite incredulity, and yet that form of speech had too much truth in it,"], [312, "300 A Schoolmaster's Stories. had they only known. Finally, in true judicial style, I asked if either of them had anything to say Avhy the sentence of the law should not be carried out forthwith. No, they were both in the same tale still : they had nothing to say Avorth taking into consideration. It was the usual story: \" Something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.\" \" I forgot all about it, but of course I ought to have remembered,\" confessed Adams with a frank modesty that did him credit. Dum said nothing. He merely looked at me so helplessly with those great ox-like eyes of his, as if appealing from justice to mercy. Would it be more pitiable or more ridiculous to inflict stripes upon this gigantic child ? The stupid boys ! Had they had Portia to plead for them, she could not have failed to raise a very evident point in their favour. It struck me all at once, and as it is the part of a just judge to act as counsel for undefended prisoners, I hastened to give them the advantage of it. Secretly, fndeed, I drew a breath of relief at the discovery. How had I not thought of this before ? I had promised to chastise the first boy who should be found guilty in this respect, but nothing had been said about the next. Was I bound to treat these two with equal rigour, or would one example not satisfy the letter as well as the spirit of the law ? It seemed rather a doubtful point, but the accused must have the benefit of it. To such a conclusion I willingly came,"], [313, "A Deed without a Name. 301 while they stood before me, wondering why this delay \u2014 \" A guilty pair, But, though an equal fate they share, Yet one alone deserves our care.\" As they had nothing to say for their own part, I hastened to explain to them the loophole I had just hit upon, through which one of them might squeeze himself, inviting them to settle between themselves Avhich should be the pardoned and Avhich the punished. Naturally, this Avas not very easily done. I could perceive a certain reluctance in either to put himself forward, yet neither would seem too ready to withdraAv from the post of peril. It was a case of noblesse oblige. These were not puny snivelling youngsters from the lowest form. They looked silently at each other. \" Let us toss up for it,\" at last murmured Dum to his comrade in misfortune. \" Couldn't Ave go halves ? \" suggested Adams, half laughing and half looking serious. With a froAvn I put aside those frivolous sug gestions. After all, it was more than one could expect of them to make such a choice fairly with out my magisterial vote. I must not shrink from that responsibility. \" You are the elder, I suppose,\" said I turning to Gerand. \" I know that, sir,\" he replied with touching resignation ; but when I thought of his age, his inoffensiveness, his stupidity, my firmness failed."], [314, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 302 To such a boy as Adams a thrashing would surely come more in the day's work. \" You are higher up in the school,\" I said to him. \" I suppose I had better take it,\" said he, with no foolish bravado, but in a tone of practical good sense and submission to the unavoidable Avhich comforted me in my anxious hesitation. I had been secretly hoping all along that he Avould volunteer. To chastise a mass of flesh like Dum's would be a sore undertaking, not to say that I might have to stand up on a chair to do it with anything like effect. And I meant this to be no slight matter; the stability of my government might depend on my noAV showing myself formid able once and for all. I looked at my watch. The ten minutes Avere nearly gone. The nasty dose must be taken noAV or never. \"Very well, Adams, I will punish you; and I hope your companion will take warning, and all the other boys, that when I say a thing is to be done, I mean to have it done. You would rather be punished now, perhaps, or will you wait till after the concert ? \" \"Oh, no, sir!\" exclaimed Adams Avith unmistak able emphasis. How would those sweet sounds jangle with the discord of such a prospect running through them ! I take it Adams had no mastery of Shakesperian quotation, unless it might be that too familiar one from Hamlet, very like a whale ! or he would perhaps have spoken out his senti-"], [315, "A Deed without a Name. 303 ments Avith \"Oh, sir, 'tis better to be brief than tedious.\" He seemed rather relieved than other wise to find that things were draAving to the bitter end. In the meanwhile I could not help a curious reminiscence coming into my head, of a German friend of mine who wrote to me once that he had made his will and appointed me one of his execu tioners. It Avas an odd thing to think of at such a time ; and I don't know why I should mention it here, unless as a specimen of the way in which my mind kept fluttering round its aim, unwilling to strike home while there was any excuse for delay. I began by desiring Gerand to withdraw. In accordance Avith the views of advanced legislation, I meant to have none but strictly private execu tions. No curious eye should be admitted to note the sufferer's bearing under punishment, not even for the sake of example. The unknown would serve as the impressive. It Avas a little difficult to make Dum aware that he might go scot-free, and that his presence was not desirable. When, however, I had got rid of him, instead of, with all brief and plain con veniency, letting Adams have justice, I still found myself faltering like a benevolent monarch who, with the death-warrant unsigned before him, wishes heartily that he could exercise the pre rogative of mercy at the price of the richest jewel in his crown. I sought refuge again in that Polonius-like characteristic of which I am not"], [316, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 304 altogether unconscious, to dilute all my proceed ings Avith a copious stream of explanation. \" Come, boy, prepare yourself,\" was, as it were, the theme of a fresh oration Avhich I noAV pro ceeded to deliver to the unhappy criminal ; but Avhile I thus trifled time, Dum suddenly presented himself again in the room. This slow-witted Bassanio had come to propose a compromise, in terms that did more honour to his heart than to his head. I fancy some of the other felloAvs must have suggested the notion to him ; he could never have hit upon it in so short a time, such a stupid fellow as he was ! It was he who once told me in school of Jael being \" the wife of Cicero,\" and I could fill a page Avith equally absurd answers of his. \" Please, sir,\" he now said, \" I will write some lines if you will let us both off altogether.\" \" No, go away,\" I said somewhat crossly. I Avould have jumped at such a proposal, had there been any power in the tongue of boy to alter me, but, to be consistent, I could have nothing but the penalty as duly decreed. Once more he made his exit from the scene, of which the interest now became intensely thrilling. This time, I locked the door after him. I also turned down the gas, as it was dazzling my eyes. Slow music would have been appropriate, and just then through the wall came the muffled notes of the scale in c, played upon the boys' piano, which solemn strain, however, was soon changed for the incongruous jingle of the Sultan's Polka."], [317, "A Deed without a Name. 305 I can fancy here a hush of expectation among the audience of this \" tedious brief scene of very tragical mirth.\" My victim and I are alone. There is no retreat for him \u2014 nor for me, the lily-livered Rhadamanthus ! Fate, stern and steadfast as in the march of a Greek tragedy, has drawn us to the brink of the inevitable catastrophe. All that can be said, has been said. Words must now give Avay to deeds. I felt myself much like a boy about to be flogged for the first time, and yet his case would not be so hopeless, since there is always the chance of his getting off by pleading \" first fault.\" But what excuse can I make for myself? I have not even a quotation to clutch at, unless it were \" Speak, hands, for me ! \" III. I FANCY some readers will suppose that the break of this chapter was meant to serve for a letting down of the curtain, as it were, while I arranged the scene for a thrilling escape at the very last moment. How they must be puzzling themselves in what way it is to come about ! It cannot be expected that a deus ex machina or a chariot drawn by fiery dragons will descend into my small study to catch up the victim when he has come to the end of his own resources. We know, indeed, how those story-tellers most dear to boyhood would have managed such a delicate U"], [318, "A Sclwolmaster's Stories. 306 point. Nothing would have been easier for Mr Harrison Ainsworth or Mr G. P. R. James, than to make a door suddenly fly open in the wall and a hoarse voice Avhisper in the prisoner's ear Follow me! as his bonds are cut and the torch is blown out, leaving the baffled torturers to knock one another down in the dark, with a peal of unearthly laughter ringing in their ears through the gloom of the vaulted dungeon.

M. Dumas also could have ex tracted his personages from far more perilous situations without the slightest difficulty. But I am no ingenious novelist; I have neither the wit nor the words to stir men's blood with sensational episodes. If anyone imagines Adams is going to get off after all, I will take leave to tell him a little story from real life, which came under my observation only the day before yesterday. The"], [319, "A Deed without a Name. 307 personages are two boys and a big dog chained up. \" That dog thinks you are going to let him loose,\" I heard one of them say. \" Then,\" said the other, in the concise and forcible speech of boyhood, \" he thinks a lie.\" Far be it from me to use such blunt language to my gentle readers : I would merely make clear that no trick is being prepared to put upon them. This interlude of holding them in play should rather be taken as representing that brief period of unconsciousness, produced by some such an\u00e6s thetic as laughing-gas, during which the mind is lost in a whirl of bewildering visions, till the spell breaking, the patient wakes up in the dentist's chair, and sees his troublesome grinder safe in the forceps before him, and joyfully knows that he has nothing more to fear. How I wished that for two minutes or so I could myself have been under chloroform ! This being out of the question, I manned myself as best I could for the ordeal. It was over ! I must do Adams the justice to say that he, for one, had performed his part in the ceremony to admiration; he stood stone still, he did not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word, nor look upon the instrument angrily. While my hand kept trembling as if the multitudinous seas I had just incarnadined, only a slight flush on his face betrayed that it was not rose water with Avhich I had been sprinkling him. Any further twitching or shrinkings, at least, were lost on my short-sighted eyes, and I even"], [320, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 308 fancied that as soon as I had finished, he drew himself up, with a certain proud show of fortitude, not to say disdain, as if to let me know \u2014 Thou hast not half the power to do me harm As I have to be hurt ! \" Even thus did Topsy laugh in her sleeve at the discipline of Miss Ophelia. It might well be, that fresh from the hands of old Grove, this lad rather despised than otherwise my puny efforts at correction. I do not know ; I am ill at these numbers. I did not care to mark my victim too closely. I was afraid to think what I had done. The piano in the other room had stopped. For the moment all the house was hushed. I feared everyone must have heard the noise I had been making in doing the deed. A pause of dead silence followed, and I was collecting my agitated thoughts to improve this occasion. Then there came a knock at the study door, as startling as that famous knocking at the gate in Macbeth. I shuddered when I heard my wife's voice; it was like the voice of Emilia demanding admittance to Othello's chamber, too late. The thing was still in my hand ; not for worlds Avould I have her see me Avith that staff of office ! Hastily I flung it into a dark corner, and, hypocrite that I was, snatched up a roll of Mary's music which lay on the table ready for the concert. I was discovered brandishing this harmless weapon with a too conscious affectation of serenity, when, at a word from me, Adams had opened the door."], [321, "A Deed without a Name. 309 \" Why, dear, are you not ready yet ? \" said Mary with her cheerful smile, little guessing what had been the cause of the delay. \"Yes \u2014 yes \u2014 \" said I, \"we are all ready now.\" But she must have wondered why I looked so downcast and shamefaced. I, indeed, had been the chief victim of my own rash vow. Then it Avas that Adams came to my rescue with a delicacy and courtesy I had not given him credit for, and which I could not enough admire. \" Shall I carry the music for you, sir ? \" he said in the most civil and unobtrusive way, as if nothing particular had happened between us. I could have hugged him. My scholar had struck the right note with a masterly touch. He meant to put me at my ease, to make me feel that he had no desire to be hard on me for what I could not help. Perhaps, also, this nonchalance may have been designed to exhibit the strength of his own spirit as rising high and steadfast above the beat ing hurricane of adversity. Anyhow, it served as a beacon for me, tossing so troublously in those Avaves of my own raising. I learned from this boy how one might suffer and be strong. Gratefully I handed over to him the roll of music, and we came out into the hall. When Adams ran to fetch his cap, I saw a hasty sign pass between him and Gerand, Avho peeped timidly out of the schoolroom as if not sure whether the omens were yet auspicious for his joining us. Yes ! it was all over, and I felt a great weight"], [322, "A Sclwolmaster's Stories. 310 lifted off my mind. In the reaction from that anxious care, I suddenly became cheerful, jovial and sportive; I rattled on with an unnatural levity which made my wife suspect more than ever that I must be ill. \" Hadn't you better stay at home ? \" said she. \" I know you are only going to oblige me. These boys will take good care of me. You would far sooner be sitting with a book than listening to the finest music in the world, wouldn't you ? \" \" Not a bit ! \" cried I. \" I like going out of a Saturday night, and I don't dislike concerts- \u2014 not even classical music. If the Muses do not find favour with schoolmasters, where, indeed, can they take refuge on the face of the earth ! Go on : I'll follow you.\" They went on, while I returned into the study to lock up \u2014 you may guess what. I had half a mind to fling away the key, like young Douglas on leaving Lochleven Castle, as I hurried after the rest of the party with the lightness of a boy just let loose from some heavy task. But my sense of shame again took possession of me when we entered the concert-room. I hardly cared to meet my neighbours face to face. Would all these good people have welcomed me so freely, had they considered Avhat powers I exercised of working woe? Would not these respectable matrons have drawn their skirts away from me, and clasped their little darlings closer to their sides, if they had guessed from what an act I came fresh among them ? I felt conscious of being a"], [323, "A Deed without a Name. 311 wolf in sheep's clothing. It seemed almost fitting that I should address the company : \" Ladies, fair ladies, I Avould wish you, or I would request you, or I would entreat you, not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life ; no, I am no such thing ; I am a man as other men are.\" Having a place of honour in the very front of the reserved seats, I realised to some extent the sensations of \"guilty creatures sitting at a play.\" It so happened that Adams sat next me \u2014 Adams! He had not sought this neighbourhood, but neither had he shunned it, Avhen no choice was left him, Dum, with characteristic stupidity, taking the other place beyond my wife \u2014 he Avould rather not sit next me ! When I saw how carefully civil my late victim showed himself in handing me the programme, my heart smote me. And the measure of my self-reproach was full, when some body sang a simple and pathetic popular melody, of American origin, I believe, \"Let me kiss him for his mother!\" I Avrithed internally at every line. What Avould this boy's mother say Avhen she knew hoAV I had been handling him for her? As we walked home under the friendly starlight, that hides so many a blush and gives courage to so many a tender voice, I hung behind the others with Adams, meaning to make him an exhorta tion Avhich took rather the tone of begging his pardon. \"My dear fellow,\" I ended, taking his arm to"], [324, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 312 bring home to him a belief in my good-will, \" I hope you understand hoAV sorry I am for this, and how anxious it may not happen again.\" \" All right, sir,\" he replied. \" I am sorry, too. I really did forget, but I shall remember now that it has been hammered into me. I wish I could always make things stick in my mind.\" Ha ! the fates had made him metaphorical, too. How Dr Busby would have fostered such a hopeful sprig ! I was about to renew my declara tions and moral applications, Avhen Adams, having indeed had enough of this subject, with great tact turned the conversation by asking me if I could show him which of the stars was the Little Bear. I Avasn't quite sure on such astronomical points ; but, in my agitation, I fear I folloAved the hint of a certain poet, \"picked out a middling shiny one, and told him that was it.\" The boys having been sent off to bed \u2014 and to talk their fill over this unwonted exercise of my authority ! \u2014 I would fain have found peace of mind in confessing all to Mary. Rather to my surprise she did not seem to make so much of what had happened. She even laughed over the story. \" I shall know better than to ask boys to tea again, when I hear you want to speak to them. Poor Adams ! I hope next time we have him in, it will not be to treat him so terribly. I dare say it will do him good; he doesn't look like a naughty boy, though.

It will be my business to manage the brimstone and treacle, you know, if we ever come to that; I am Mrs Squeers. You mustn't laugh when you see me stirring up the gruesome bowl ; and next time you have to administer your brimstone, let me know, that I may keep out of the way, and not put too much of my treacle into the dose. Well, I am glad you had not to punish my friend Dum; it Avould have been ungrateful of you after his exerting himself so nobly to finish that stale cake for us.\" Now, is not that the Avay with women ? Soft hearted as they are, they seem to make no account of troubles which lie outside their own experience or powers of imagination, and hold light those trying duties which are spared them by the devotion of the sterner sex. My Mary has no faults ; still, there appears in her nature a certain sense of wayward humour, that, however charming at times, is apt to display itself unseasonably, never more so than when she seems to hint that I have been performing a part in Much Ado about Nothing. I can enjoy a joke, as well as any man, in its proper place; but a schoolmaster's"], [326, "314 A Schoolmaster's Stories. wife must be above all suspicion of trifling with serious matters. Sunt lachrym\u0153 rerum ! My sternness did not fail to be justified by results. The forbidden deed to which I have given no name became henceforth as rare as it had once been common. So far so good. I remained ill at ease as to the verdict of public opinion upon my proceedings. What Avould these boys be thinking and saying of me ? Did it not appear to them that I had acted unfairly in laying an ambush for my victim, in having him to tea without any hint of what was in store for him, in playing with him as a cat does with a mouse, and at last pouncing on him \" unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,\" so to speak ? What a brute I must be voted among them ! Flow they would despise and distrust my honeyed professions, when I had shown myself capable of taking such crafty advantage of them ! So it vaguely seemed to me, and I was not a little surprised as well as relieved by a passage in a letter which my Avife had from Adams's mother a week or so later. \" Willy tells' us,\" wrote Mrs Adams, \" that he has been punished for breaking the rule about . . . a most dangerous practice, and I am glad to hear of its being strongly prohibited. He seems to think it rather a distinction than otherwise to have been the first to suffer at the new master's hands, and he speaks most approvingly of your husband's manner in managing such business. \u2014 ' As soon as he has licked a felloAv, he is as jolly as ever again with him, and behaves to you out of school just as"], [327, "A Deed without a Name. 315 if nothing had happened.

' \u2014 There, I have betrayed my boy's con fidence, and hope you will be discreet in dealing Avith mine. You must take Willy's criticism for what it is worth. Thoughtless boys, of course, don't like to be talked to about their shortcomings; but some day both they and their parents will be grateful to a master who takes the pains to ' lecture ' them when they go wrong. We are much pleased to hear that Willy is getting on so well,\" etc., etc. So after all it was a visionary bugbear that had been disturbing me ! Throughout my scholastic career, I have always been too prone to fancy that boys resented my severities, while they perhaps may have been chuckling to have come off no worse than they did. I am only noAv learning to believe that if a master make himself known as just and kindly on the whole, most well-conditioned boys will put up in a good-humoured enough spirit with what they deserve at his hands, and will not be too ready to call him to account for occasional deviations into a harshness they may less deserve. All the same, it is better to be hard on oneself than to play the tyrant towards those who have next to no redress against oppression, except in the happy elasticity of their own spirits, whereby, indeed, they get generally the best of it. \" The tear forgot as soon as shed, The sunshine of the breast ! \""], [328, "316 A Schoolmaster's Stories. In the end, too, I have reason to think that I must have thrown away much sympathy on my young friend Adams. Some time later, there came to my knowledge a notable device hatched among these boarders of mine. I may have been misin formed in part ; but the main features of what I am going to relate, are to be relied on as facts. It seems that when I entered upon office there was much speculation among them as to how, when, and where would begin the work of correction which their experience of \" old Grove \" had taught them to consider as inseparably connected with the functions of a schoolmaster. Then these ingenious youngsters actually banded themselves into a sort of insurance union against my supposed ferocity. They agreed to subscribe one halfpenny each from their weekly pocket-money, to form a fund which should become the property of the first among the subscribers on Avhom I happened to lay my hands not in the way of kindness. Here was a pretty sweepstakes, in which I must be the unconscious umpire ! As weeks passed by without such an incident as they had reckoned on, the fund grew like a snowball, and the excitement became more and more intense as to whose lot it should fall to at last. Two or three bold spirits or hardened skins, I now see reason to suspect, had even put themselves in the way of my indignation, hoping thus to enrich their pockets at the expense of their feelings ; but their enter prise was foiled by my scrupulous humanity,"], [329, "A Deed wit/wut a Name. 317 and it began to look as if there would be no thrashing after all. They had made love to this chastisement ! I acquit Adams of any such intention; still, when he did stumble into that scrape, it was to his profit as well as to his loss ; and while bearing the conse quences, it must have been no slight consolation to him to knoAV that I Avas engrossing upon his person the title to a handsome prize of fortitude for which some boys would have been content \" the keenest Avhips to wear like rubies.\" The accumulated money, in fact, had thereafter been handed over to him by clear right, and he very properly spent it all in treating the house to a feast of sweet things, which, indirectly and directly too, were the fruit of the cane. On making this discovery, I was so much dis gusted that, like Prospero, I broke my wand, made a bonfire of the whole lot of them, renouncing for ever such \" rough magic.\" Still, I must confess, it was more for my own sake than that of my boys, that I thus resigned the time-honoured sceptre of school authority. The divining rod by which pedagogues in all ages have been wont to bring to light what treasures are hid in their pupils' minds, has, I admit, its charms as well as its terrors. There are some schoolmasters who know the touch of it, as I believe: there may be much music, excellent voice in this little organ, yet cannot I make it speak to good effect. How I got on without it, I may take another opportunity of telling. In the meanwhile, I will only ask whether"], [330, "318 A Schoolmaster's Stories. my readers do not agree with me that, in the language of the poet, if for once in the Avay I may be allowed to make a quotation \u2014 \" Of all the studies in the round of learning, From nature's marvels down to human toys, To minds well fitted for acute discerning, The very queerest one is that of boys.\""], [331, "319 MY ASSISTANTS. I BEGAN these reminiscences as a very humble neophyte in Minerva's temple ; I end them as a hierophant, speaking oracles both to boys and to men. The discriminating reader who has been taken into the secret of my later pedagogic tribulations, need not suppose them unsalved by the rewards of outAvard success. If this record read too much like a half serious book of Lamen tations or subrisive Jeremiad, it will only be because my cross-grained humour finds comedy in distilling the sweetness of bitter experiences, and philosophy in letting oneself be tickled by the whips and scorns of time. Every term, the school grew in numbers, so that I had soon to augment my staff, and with it my cares and responsibilities. After dwelling, perhaps, more than enough on the difficulties a schoolmaster may have with his boys, I would now fain make my moan over the troubles I have had through assistant-masters, a more troublesome race, in my experience, and I think some emeriti of the profession, at least, will sympathise with me."], [332, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 320 I know less of the present state of things, when the teacher seems to be casting his humble slough and appearing fresh in his true character as an honourable minister of civilisation. These reminis cences, be it understood, date back some four or five lustra, before the scholastic market became glutted with a supply of university men, good, bad, and indifferent. In those days, we minor archididascali who presided over second or third rate country grammar-schools, had to draw our subalterns largely from what may be called the non-commissioned ranks of the educational army, most of whom had enlisted from despair of success in other occupations, and few such conscripts could hope to carry a headmaster's birch in his knap sack. Good men were to be found among them here and there, teachers born rather than made ; but what could be expected of the motley mass to whom teaching was not so much a profession as an irksome resource for bare livelihood ? It was natural that these unqualified and ill paid hirelings should take little interest in their work, and that one found it hard to treat them as trustworthy colleagues, to whom one's juvenile sheep, themselves not over hungry for instruction, neither looked up to, nor were fed by their lean and flashy attainments. Yet schools like mine, in its struggling days, had nothing for it but to pick and choose among this floating population of ushers, who came and went almost as often as flighty maid-servants, helped on from place to place by the testimonials which unconscientious"], [333, "My Assistants. 321 or too good-natured employers were often glad to give by way of getting rid of them. Myself not ignorant of the agony of writing those dimissory recommendations so as to reconcile truth and charity, I had learned to be greatly distrustful of the testimonials of others in like case. I made a point also of never employing \"scholastic agents.\" Imagine, then, hoAv often my holidays Avere soured by the task of engaging a new assistant, hoping less to find a pearl than fearing once more the chance of an empty shell. Is there one of my professional brethren of that era who can lay his hand on his heart and avow that he was never tempted to Avink at the incom petence of his staff, willing rather to bear with known shortcomings than fly to others that might prove more intolerable ? Then the trouble of managing my didactic team when caught and harnessed ! I have some times said in my haste that a poet is an emblem of eupeptic good nature and common sense compared to that truly irritabile genus with whom I have had so much to do, while indeed, like Mr Browning's personage, I never knew but one poet in my life, and he never got the length of printing at his own expense. I hope I give no offence in asserting that a certain touch of opinionativeness, of self-assertion, of bumptiousness even, has in my experience frequently alloyed the temperament that goes to make success as a teacher. Your modest and retiring man fails to impress himself on the elastic mind of youth. Parson Adams, we X"], [334, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 322 remember, thought a schoolmaster the greatest character in the world, and himself the greatest of all schoolmasters. Like that worthy, I trust that I am a foe to the silly passion of vanity, for his sermon on which he was so confident of obtaining admiration. It may be, however, that for this Aveakness some of us preachers against it have what has been aptly called \" the keen eye of an accomplice.\" At all events, in dealings with these subordinates of mine, it has been my lot to feel how ready schoolmasters, and not always the worst of schoolmasters, are to rub painfully against one another's angles, more so for instance, I think, than senior and junior officers of the army and navy, who, perhaps, find it easier to keep step in their professional exercises. The instructor of youth, bound to play the great man in a small way, bears, like the Turk, no brother near his desk \u2014 even though it be but a satrap-throne. It takes a Avell-conditioned or well-trained nature to counteract the unwhole some effect of being so much a Gulliver among Lilliputians, an erudite comparison Avhich, of course, one OAves to Charles Lamb's essay on schoolmasters, where he so well handles the fault at which I hint. One of my best masters, regarded simply as a gerund-grinding machine, was also one of the most ignorant and conceited fellows that ever failed to pass the London University matricula tion. Though, after repeated attempts, he had given up this ordeal as a bad test of his powers,"], [335, "My Assistants. 323 he was by no means unqualified for the work I required of him. In early youth, somehow or other, there had been hammered into him a certain mastery of the elements of Latin grammar, the rules of arithmetic, and the like ; and such knowledge he had a remarkable knack of driving, in turn, into the hard heads of his pupils with the same thoroughness. It shows what a good teacher he was \u2014 using the word still in a narrow sense \u2014 that Avhen I examined his boys, nearly every one of them would now and then be found making the same mistake, for which of course their master's ignorance, or his crib, was to blame. He took great interest in his Avork also, which I believe came mainly from the opportunity it gave him of posing as a pinchbeck Socrates before the undiscriminating audience of his class. Strange to say, the boys apparently did not find him out, but rather took the man at his own valuation, looking up to him, and even liking him, for he Avas a good-natured fellow at bottom so long as his uneasy vanity were duly propitiated by the incense of perfunctory reverence. He often re minded me of that humbug Dr Spick, my first \" Principal,\" who likewise had a certain gift of imposing upon boys his little knowledge, and but for his amazing ignorance, might have been not a bad teacher. This officer made, then, an excellent drill sergeant for rudimentary learning, but as a colleague he Avas less desirable. I could not abide his airs of pretentious wisdom and strained"], [336, "A Sclwolmaster's Stories. 324 gentility, the struts and smirks with which he thought to carry off his real emptiness. Then he was so touchy about his self-conscious dignity. I have known vain men whose conceit took a more amiable form, wrapping them like a blanket against all the troubles of life. There was one such lieutenant of mine who could hardly buy a postage stamp without being persuaded that the postmaster had picked out a superior repre sentation of the Queen's head for his benefit, and Avent thus through the world happily convinced that all men were as well disposed towards him as he himself. But the character at present under consideration had in his self-satisfaction a some what ragged mantle that freely let in cold blasts from the judgment of his neighbours. His good opinion of his own merits stood in need of constant corroboration, perhaps through some gracious doubt, some glimmering of true wisdom, some \" far-off touch of greatness to know well he was not great.\" So, while full of affectation as a pea cock and obstinate as a mule, he was tormented by a jealous suspicion which kept him always on the qui vive to resent imaginary offences against that hungry vanity of his. It was set with a hair trigger that went off at the slightest touch. Naturally he Avas always quarrelling Avith his colleagues, and I had to be continually labouring to keep the peace among them, as well as to soothe his ruffled susceptibilities on my own account. As often as he sought a private inter view with me, I used to pray for the patience"], [337, "My Assistants. 325 of Job, knowing well to Avhat sores I should have to supply a poultice. If I had not valued the man for some points in him, I should never have taken so much trouble; as it was, I let him \" submit his resignation,\" as he loftily phrased it, at least a dozen times, and still coaxed him back into temporary contentment, till at last he came to presume on my forbearance. We separated on a little matter \u2014 a question of vestments rather than doctrine. He had a way of aping the country gentleman in his attire, not successfully. I ventured delicately to remonstrate Avith him about a velveteen jacket and certain sporting-like neckties, Avhich, if he but knew it, Avere most criard adornments of his somewhat weedy and slouching figure. My good sir fired up at this, retorted by a tu quoque criticism on my OAvn style of dress, and sent in his resignation Avinged by certain words of underbred insolence. I think he was sorry, on reflection, that this time it was accepted. I sought to part friends with him, but he remained resentfully implacable, and took leave of me by a letter, in which I was reviled as \" unworthy of the character of a scholar, much less of a gentleman,\" a phrase Avhich, I daresay, tickled him rather by its sound than by any definite idea of its meaning. The boys presented him with a testimonial, and, I have little doubt, voted me a tyrant. Thus he went his Avay, not without good Avishes on my part, as well as fears for his future. I have since heard that he became a dissenting"], [338, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 326 minister, and met Avith some acceptance in this vocation. On the other hand, I have had assistants who erred from modesty. Such an one was an ex-pupil whom, partly for his own sake, to give him an opportunity of further instruction, partly on account of economy, and partly as an experiment, I kept on in the house to teach the junior form and look after my boarders. I never made a greater mistake. The poor fellow was an epitome of all the invertebrate virtues, but only too conscious of his want of back-bone. He could not say Bo to a goose, much less to a boy. With this softness of character, he Avas severely handi capped by the fact of having been the schoolfellow of many of these boys over whom he must now play, in a sort, the part of ruler, Avhile he never got over his awe of me as his old master. The boys, who led him a woeful life of it Avith their pranks, nicknamed him Mr Toots; and, indeed, he had a ludicrous resemblance to that personage, which alone would have been enough to destroy his authority among them. How often have I seen him hanging about to catch me alone, that he might make some timid complaint or seek some needless counsel ! He used to be always coming to me Avith the construing of simple sentences in the Delectus, as to which he distrusted his own judgment. I tried hard to encourage this modest youth, but it seemed easier to prop up a pilloAv-case so that it might stand alone; and I found rather extra labour for myself than"], [339, "My Assistants. 327 assistance in the services of such an unmasterful master. Mr Toots's scholastic career lasted just six weeks. I shall never forget the last scene of it. I had procured a well-known bishop to give away the prizes, and, for the more ceremonious performance of this function, had erected a platform in the large schoolroom, whereon sat enthroned his dignified lordship, Avith myself and the governors of the school on his right hand, and on his left the assistant-masters. They, however, finding them selves too prominent in this situation, had one by one slipped down to mingle with their boys, all but Mr Toots, who, though ill at ease, had not the courage to make a move. There he sat alone in his glory, wearing for the first time in his life a long-tailed coat and high collars that half hid his smooth pink cheeks. What was his confusion Avhen the bishop, after duly soft-soaping me, turned round Avith \u2014 -\"and to his able and excellent staff of assistant-masters \" ! Here he found no one but the blushing Mr Toots to represent the staff, on whose head the orator proceeded to pour a torrent of eloquent eulogy, under which the awkward youth Avas petrified in open-mouthed consterna tion, his face red as a peony, hardly daring to breathe, shrunk up on his chair, till I feared he would fall off from sheer bewilderment. The boys afterwards declared that his hair stood on end while the bishop was haranguing him at such close quarters. He certainly looked most miser able till the speech Avas finished, when the applause"], [340, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 328 came mingled with a roar of laughter at his most evident plight of dismay. It doesn't do always, however, to trust to a modest demeanour, for I have had an assistant who looked as if butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, and who so flattered and deferred to me at first that I conceived a high opinion of his judgment ; but, by-and-by, when his claAvs grew, he turned out one of the most cantankerous men I ever was troubled Avith. Of him let us not speak, but look and pass on. I will do Mary the justice of recording that she warned me against this traitor from the first. After the experience of Mr Toots, I made a mistake of another kind in engaging a master as much too old as lie was too young. This gentle man Avas already a grey-haired paterfamilias, well to-do also, who late in life had the fancy of being ordained. He was represented to me as taking a great interest in education, and Avilling to serve for next to no salary on consideration of my giving him a title to orders. Such a gift-horse I did not care to look closely in the mouth ; but, when too late, I found how ill he went in harness. He had, indeed, a certain zeal for his new Avork, though not according to knowledge ; he was a Avell-meaning man in his way, but unpunctual, irascible, obstinate, and full of fads, Avith which he insisted on ex perimenting at the cost of my school. How was I to rebuke a man old enough to be my father, Avho showed a disposition from the first to snub me instead of submitting his inexperience to my"], [341, "My Assistants. 329 authority ? Our relations were always delicate, and soon became strained. From remonstrances it greAV to disputes, the ladies of the two families, also, not hitting it off Avith each other ; then at every hitch my unmanageable assistant used to fire up and refer me to his solicitor. At length things came to a sad pass, in which he is said to have told a naughty boy, \" If I were on speaking terms with the Headmaster, sir, I would have you caned ! \" He did not stick at abusing me to the boys, as Avell as all over the toAvn, Avhere he met with considerable acceptance in society, and Avas able to pose, at my expense, as a martyr of noble-minded educational enthusiasm. The Avorst of it was that, the bishop having granted him a title on his mastership, I could not get rid of him at will, defended by the \u00e6gis of that episcopal protector. For two years I had to stagger along Avith such a burdensome old man of the sea on my shoulders ; and, Avhen at last I was able to cast him off, I resolved never again to take an assistant master for the sake of cheapness. This was an Irishman. I have an odd reminis cence of a Scotch dominie, who had somehow drifted into our southern latitudes. An M.A. of Aberdeen, a man of years and experience, he came with excellent testimonials and seemed well up to his Avork, yet from the first I had a vague idea that there must be something wrong about him. If he were so blameless as represented, how did he come to have changed his situation so often ? and why should he accept mine at a salary hardly tempting"], [342, "A Schoolmaster's Stories. 330 to a younger and less qualified man ? Such were the questions I asked myself, keeping a doubtful eye on his ddbut, as one watches a new horse, warranted sound and free from vice, of which yet one has got so good a bargain as to be suspicious of some fault. Our northener, however, went quietly along like a well-trained roadster, showing no sign of bolting or rearing or shirking his work. His paces, indeed, Avere not showy, which pleased me just as well. He seemed the very man I wanted for the younger boys \u2014 quiet, sensible, orderly, and patient, an assistant of all work, and not above the petty details of his duty. The worst of him was his uncommunicativeness. You never caught him opening his lips except in the way of business. He made no friends, not even among his colleagues, but, school once over, retired to his humble lodgings and there spent his time in studies or occupations of his own. He gave us the im pression of a fossil usher of the old school, rusted over with an impervious coating of Caledonian reserve. Many attempts were made in vain to draw him out. My wife and I had him to dinner, clad in an ancient suit of black, \"courtly once and conscientious still,\" that had no doubt appertained to his early ambition as what the French translator termed un pretre assassine. Like so many of his kind, he had tried and failed to wag his head in a Scotch pulpit. He accepted our hospitality in the same painful spirit of duty as he brought to his class, eating and drinking such things as Avere"], [343, "My Assistants. 331 offered him, and not speaking unless Avhen spoken to. \" He must have something on his mind,\" was my conclusion ; but Mary at once conceived for him a little romance of disappointed love and an early soured life. We Avere as far off as before from knowing the man. Then I took him a walk one Saturday afternoon. Still I could not strike a gleam of interest out of him, till just as Ave came back to the toAvn all at once I saAv his dull eye light up behind those thick spectacles which seemed part of the man himself. I had happened to touch on a theological work lately published to advance novel theories as to the book of Daniel. \" Man ! the fellow knows nae mair aboot it than any auld wife that never saw the Screeptures in the oreeginal !\" he exclaimed with sudden vehem ence, relapsing into the strong Scotch accent which in his ordinary conversation had been toned down by years of southern sojourn. \" Bishops and professors and doctors of diveenity, a' at sea, a' in the dark, a' blind to the prophecies, and none will open his eyes when the truth is shown him clear as daylight ! \" It all came out with a rush. My wooden assistant, whom I had supposed wholly destitute of imagination, was living in a world of the loftiest visions hidden from all other eyes. To him alone out of a world of men, as he believed, had been revealed a key of those mysterious prophecies over which so many biblical scholars have addled their brains in all ages."], [344, "A Sclwolmaster's Stories. 332 Fairly carried off my feet by the sudden irrup tion of this lava-flood pent up beneath such a cold exterior, I hardly knew what to say; and I fear my civil expressions of interest misled the man into taking me as on the high road to conviction. He bustled me forthwith into his attic rooms, and there eagerly spread out before me certain long strips of linen, on which, with the queerest emblems and devices, he had symbolically mapped out the Avhole course of history, past, present, and future, as made clear in the light of his discovery. His hand trembled and his voice had a strange thrill in it as he hurried me along the outlines of that scheme of his. It was a wild jumble of horns and beasts, thrones and kingdoms, dates and dreams, even at the time almost incomprehensible to an amazed sceptic like myself; but the upshot of it came to this, that Louis Napoleon was destined to restore the Jews to Palestine, as prelude to the end of the world. Now, that potentate had just been driven into exile, which I could not help mentioning as a hitch in the course of events thus foretold ; but my expounder of prophecy gave no importance to this objection. Of course, he believed the House of Buonaparte Avould be restored, since his theory so required. \" I have often written to him, but the Emperor never answers me,\" he said ; and his dull uncon sciousness to all such rebuffs was infinitely pathetic. He went on to tell me of his hopes and plans, showing a faith that struck me dumb with admiring sadness. For years, it appeared, he had been"], [345, "My Assistants. 333 saving out of his slender salary, and now had almost got together enough to buy a magic-lantern and slides, by the aid of which he trusted to bring the \"scheme\" down to the meanest capacity. With this convincing apparatus he meant to travel the country, and made no doubt of being able to convert the Avhole nation Avhen once the matter was put clearly before it. In the meantime, his main trouble was that those English landladies of his could not properly concoct the porridge on Avhich he would fain live, causing him to Avaste with bakers and butchers money that should else have been devoted to that one absorbing interest. What could one say to him ? I had not the heart to laugh at this honest enthusiast, nor even to disturb him in his gratissimus error. One felt a secret envy of the man for Avhom such a magnificent delusion Avas meat, drink, and clothing against all the ills of life. To spend one's days in useful, patient labour, and to have an abiding dream like this for pastime \u2014 were it not better than any measure of worldly honour or prosperity? I could only back out of the controversy to which he confidently invited me ; and I also thought Avell to drop a strong hint that the subject of prophecy was not in our school course. I shall never forget the downcast look with which the poor man showed me to the door. All the light had gone out of his eyes, once more glassily lifeless as his spectacles. He had thought to find a convert, and perhaps for the thousandth time had been dis-"], [346, "-<4 Schoolmaster's Stories. 334 appointed when his disciple became transformed again into a scholastic employer. After that, you may be sure, I had a sharper eye than ever upon his work. It was to be feared that, as Mr Dick could not keep the head of Charles I. out of his interminable memorial, so, sooner or later, this interpreter of prophecy Avould seek to impress his peculiar views upon the young minds given him to inoculate with sound doctrines in history and geography. Sure enough, before long, one of the small boys opened himself to my wife on certain uncanny tales of beasts and horns Avith Avhich Mr had been alarming his pupils' susceptible imagination. He took to lecturing in the town-hall also, and brought down our local pastors upon me. The end of it was that I had to get rid of him, with sincere regret. I have never heard of him since, but I often wonder what has become of the man, and how, after Napoleon's death in exile, he managed to piece out that sad rent on the scheme of prophecy. I make little doubt he found means of explaining away to himself even such a fatal hiatus in his hieroglyphic manuscripts, which, I fancy, have not yet attained to magic-lantern publication. As the school continued to flourish, I was able to improve my staff both in quantity and in quality. Mary and I thought it a bold step in advance when we first Avent to the expense of engaging a Wrangler. We heard of a gentleman who had taken a high place in the classical as well as in the mathematical tripos, and, after due"], [347, "My Assistants. 335 correspondence, we came to terms Avithout thinking it necessary in such a case to insist on a personal interview, or even a photograph of our illustrious candidate. Imagine our mortification when he turned out to be a dwarf, suffering from chronic ill-health, and with a shrill squeaky voice that set the boys on the grin as soon as they heard it. With his hat on, for he was almost bald, he had a singularly juvenile appearance; the day of his arrival, indeed, he Avas taken for a new boy, and subjected to familiar indignities in the playground. Then he Avas a misanthrope, who shunned the company of other men, but actually hated boys, and had no idea of teaching beyond flying into a passion Avith his class Avhen the comprehension of Virgil and Euclid did not come as natural to them as to himself. Withal, he was pleased rather to look down on me because my university career had not been quite so distinguished as his own. There could be no doubt of his cleverness after a sort ; he never said a foolish thing \u2014 unless on the frequent occasions Avhen he lost his temper \u2014 and never did a wise one. As he was utterly incapable of preserving discipline, too shortsighted even to perceive when the boys were playing the fool right before his nose, you may guess what a help he was to me as second master. I hardly durst turn my back on the schoolroom so long as I must leave such a viceroy in charge. Space fails me to tell of all the disappoint ments I had in masters who at first promised fairly. There was the muscular Christian assistant,"], [348, "336 A Schoolmaster's Stories. scarcely weaned from the Avays of a very rough public school, whom I imported to raise our athletic tone, but Avho ultroneously and illegally took to beat ing the boys with such Spartan gusto as to bring down angry parents upon me. There was that \"gentle Johnian \" who played the dandy, and fell in love with his pupils' sisters to a scandalous extent. There was the accomplished foreigner, familiar with the language and perhaps Avith the criminal procedure of almost every country in Europe, Avho turned out to be an arrant knave, wanted by the police. There was the literary usher I had to dismiss for drunkenness, who has since contributed to a popular religious magazine a story of school life in which, if I mistake not, I appear as villain of the piece. There was the elegant Parisian, who mistook my Avife's kindly interest for a warmer sentiment \u2014 but that reminis cence were best committed to faithful silence. It may seem that I dwell too much on the black sheep among my assistants. I ought not to forget the many good men for Avhose services I have been most thankful at the time, fortemque Gyan, fortemque Cloanthum. But alas ! it is the evil men do that lives chiefly in one's memory. I Avill conclude, hoAvever, by mentioning one of my most successful experiments in teaching power. Once, a junior master being ill, Mary volunteered to take his class, and this innovation, after a little bewilderment on both sides, so justified itself as to put us on engaging a good governess for the youngest boys. Of course I did not make such"], [349, "My Assistants. 337 an important choice Avithout counsel of my wife, always the most trustworthy of my assistants; and Ave finally went up to town and engaged a young lady, whom between ourselves Ave used to call Gruyere. To explain this little private joke of ours, you must be let know that before conclud ing the arrangement we appointed an interview Avith her at a once well-known restaurant, SAvept away by recent metropolitan improvements. Mary and I had agreed artfully to draw her out during luncheon, and had fixed upon a code of signals by which at the end of the meal we should communi cate to each other the opinion we had formed of our candidate. If we liked her very much Ave were to order Gruyere cheese; if fairly well, Stilton ; if we thought she might possibly do, Cheddar ; while no cheese was to mean decided disapproval. We both ordered Gruyere. Then she said she Avould take the same cheese ; and we accepted it as a good augury. Miss \" Gruyere \" remained Avith us for years, and, once a certain prejudice on the boys' part had been got over, became such a useful Avheel in our machinery, that I would suggest the example to my fellow-Avorkers. The best scholars have not always the sympathy and patience indispens able for a good teacher, especially of small boys, and I believe that Avomen less often fail in these qualities. I am well aware what a revolution in boys' education I am advocating ; but, on the whole, I think its results would be favourable both morally and intellectually. The very presence of Y"], [350, "338 A Sclwolmaster's Stories. a woman must let in daylight on the old coarseness and brutality of English schools. These charac teristics, indeed, are fast going out of date, and I myself have played my small part in the refor mation. There is nothing now in the discipline of good schools from which a lady need shrink. On the whole, the change from Busby and Boyer is for the best. Yet, in my hesitating mood, I sometimes wonder whether future generations of Englishmen will turn out as good French-fighting and world-subduing animals as those who were so unmercifully hacked at Rugby or funded at Winchester. It is a source of weakness in me to be a Conservative at heart, Avhile a Liberal on principle; thus, in all the improvements by which I raised a decayed country grammar school to a fair standing, my mind seldom failed to be clouded by a doubt which perhaps enfeebled my authority, and brought about for me more trouble than most headmasters have from their assistants, not to speak of misunderstandings with the boys, who by nature are a kind of Tory-democrats. I return always to my moutons. The proper study of schoolmaster kind is boy. In my haste, I have said hard things about English schoolboys, who, after all, are the fathers to English men. But my last scholastic experience, had I space and heart to dwell on it, was of a kind to give me new thoughts. For the time came when, partly on considerations of health, partly as tempted by a high figure in depreciated rupees, I accepted the Principalship of an educational institution in the"], [351, "My Assistants. 339 Far East, founded by a more or less enlightened native prince, Avho, not content Avith having the finest collection of tigers in India \u2014 the fiercest looking of which, by the way, bore over her cage the inscription, Bom at Dublin, Ireland, that always struck me as a singular sending of coals to NeAvcastle \u2014 grew ambitious to grace his capital Avith a college after European models.

My assistants now Avere mostly dark-skinned and Avhite-garbed pundits, who held me in due rever ence as type of a conquering race. My scholars were shambling, squatting youths, with a perpetual crick in their soft backbones and a cringing smile on their dusky faces. To see those flabby lads first efforts at cricket, which they set about with solemn aAve and doubt, half inclined to look on it as one of the Gothic religious rites by which they might lose caste ! And now I could have led a lotus life, paying myself all arrears of worries and toils in the current coin of flattery. There was a young Parsee among my pupils, whom Ave tried to make friends with, as having rather more manhood than the rest ; and Mary was taken roundly to task by a lady from the adjacent cantonments for asking him to sit down in her august presence.

But the best will in the Avorld never Avon my heart to those smooth young heathens, Avith the finest of Brahminical morals ready on their lips and the floweriest of Persian sentiments off by heart, yet with an expression lurking behind their mild eyes that sometimes suggested to me the hooded cheetahs and lynxes one met being led about like pet dogs through the streets of that gorgeous city. Nor could I ever abide the climate, no more its months of dazzling sunshine than its weeks of stifling damp, when Avith closed doors and darkened windows we had to make one long, listless \"Europe morning\" of what used to be our happy English holidays. Panting and perspiring, how Ave then used to sigh for a breath of bracing Dartmoor air, or a sight of a wholesome potato patch \u2014 far brighter than those gaudily blooming bougainvillias or those heavily-floAvered castor-oil plants ! A primrose by the river's brim would be in no danger of being despised by Peter Bells on the other side of Aden.

Dignities, gravities, and such-like, indeed, are in no sound state that cannot stand a laugh raised about them. The gargoyles of medi\u00e6val fanes, the grim freedoms of Puritan and old Presbyterian believers, bespeak an age of well-rooted faith ; Avhile there are shrines where it beseems us to hush lest Ave bring down all like a house of cards. In other lands one comes to recognise how a certain temperateness of judgment, as well as of climate, makes the strong point of our Anglo-Saxon nature. It may be our familiar shiftings of cloud and sunshine Avhich teach us the trick of passing, with a good-natured grumble, from grave to gay, from lively to severe. The dull fanaticism, the dreamy languor, and the barren subtleness of the East have often suggested to me Avhat a wholesome salt of life is this faculty for turning to different sides of things. And if any set of men will be the better for a sense of humour, implying a sense of due relation and proportion, it is schoolmasters, doomed so much to be solemn over trifles and wordy in common-places.
