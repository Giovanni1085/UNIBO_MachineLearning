That the great Western Continent of our earth bears wit ness to a venerable past, is a world-accepted fact, and that its gradual advance in culture has been in obedience to a fixed law of humanity, is also a matter beyond dispute. A different dis tribution of land and water on the globe is a possible factor in the problem of the early spread of the human race, but as yet science has not been able to solve this question, and with all the lights of modern civilization, no sifting of the mutilated rec ords of the past has brought the long-sought knowledge. No firm foundation has been found on which to fix the first link in a chain of reasoning ; no corner stone on which to build a theory of the primeval dawn. In the language of a distinguished scientist, \"Multitudes of races and nations have arisen upon the American Continent and have disappeared, leaving no trace but ruins, mounds, a few wrought stones or fragments of pot tery. History can only preserve facts founded on written records, or bona fide traditions, and it is from these formula tions that it builds up chronology and traces the pedigree of nations. Here all these fail. Those whom we are disposed to call aborigines are perhaps but the conquerors of other races that preceded them ; conquerors and conquered are for gotten in a common oblivion and the names of both have passed from the memory of man.\" It is generally agreed that Asia was the cradle of the human race, and that by successive migrations during an incalculable period man spread to the uttermost parts of the globe. The stories of Memphis, Thebes, Babylon, Assyria, Lydia, Media, and Persia, open our minds to the progress of mankind in early days, and from the history of Egypt alone we can form some idea of that ancient world which in process of"], [34, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 2 time was to people the whole earth. In recent wonderful discoveries at Tel El-Amarna, in Upper Egypt of epistolary correspondence between Egyptian kings of the 18th dynasty (or 15th century B. C.) and potentates of Western Asia, we are confronted with the surprising truth that this was a period of great literary activity, and that there was a \"world of letters\" before the Hebrew conquest of Palestine, is now a widely spread opinion. Dwelling upon the constantly unfold ing revelations of the hoary past, we may well conceive how advanced were the nations of the ancient world, and how pop ulous must have been the continent which drove its surplus human hordes upon the far shores of America. That these waves of living men, belonging to the outer edges of Asiatic nomadic barbarism, came to North America by Behring Strait, and spread along the line of the 30th parallel, south, to South America, is a plausible hypothesis, but of their growth afterwards nothing definite can be known. It is only supposed that they passed through the necessary processes of evolution until, after centuries of waiting, they reached a higher and higher plane of culture, gradually crystalizing their ideas in so permanent a form that pre-historic remains are scattered broadcast over the three Americas. To the North, these vestiges of life exist from the Rocky Mountains on the West to the Alleghanies on the East ; from the Great Lakes on the North to the Gulf of Mexico on the South ; and the monuments of Mexico, Peru, and Central America pro claim a yet more advanced degree of culture. These last \"must have required skilled labor, a numerous population, and an established priesthood, such as could have developed only during the lapse of centuries.\" But not the works of man alone tell of the teeming life which in the remote past covered this continent with sentient beings. Traces of myriads of human skeletons speak their own story of a brief sojourn upon earth, but leave no certain clue to solve the mystery of their being. Which way they came, which way they went, what form they wore, is lost for ever to the grasp of human lore. Yet in the great brother hood of humanity, it touches a chord of sympathy to know"], [35, "INTROD UCTION. 3 that these early peoples had their homes among the mountains and valleys which we call our own ; that they basked in the same sun and slept beneath the same stars we love to gaze on, and that they buried their bones in the same Mother Earth that will receive our ashes ! Further than this we cannot go ; Night wrapt their cradle round with darkness, and having run their course they fell into eternal silence. Thus, no effort of arch\u00e6ologist or biologist has ever traced a history of these forgotten races, and hidden in the shell-heap, the mound, and the pueblo, or buried beneath the monuments of Mexico and the farther South, lie peoples that have perished from the annals of the world, leaving in the great march of life only a nameless grave to mark their by-gone and mysterious existence. This shadowy outline of what may scarce be called a history, is that which can be told of the earliest state of America ; but the time was drawing near for a long-delayed and higher life to which the Creator of the universe had destined it. For several centuries before the Christian era, philosophers had taught that the earth was round, and that the water which bounded Europe on the West washed also the shores of Asia on the East. This opinion gained ground as the years rolled on, and it was said of him who was ordained to be the great, successful Navigator, that he \"comforted him selfe with this hope, that the land had a beginning where the sea had an ending.\" To find a shorter route to India and to win a portion of the trade as yet carried on by caravans with the farther East, had long been the dream of the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the English. But to students and wise men the great field of discovery offered a nobler aim \u2014 the certain knowledge of the formation of the globe and the consequent advancement of mankind. And so it came to pass in the 15th century, that Christopher Columbus, the geographer and philosopher, the hardy mari ner and dauntless apostle of an untried creed, tempted the \"Sea of Darkness\" and sailed toward the horizon's rim. By faith and patience he fulfilled the prophecy of ages."], [36, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 4 When he had traversed a waste of waters and robbed Old Ocean of his hidden treasure, in the transport of his joy he knelt and kissed the ground; at this, a reflex of \"The Sleeping Beauty\" of romance, the land awoke, and \" In that new world which is the old,\" rose to renewed vitality. Although it is asserted that the Western Continent had been seen as early as the ioth century by roving Norsemen, still its real discovery was made by* Christopher Columbus in 1492. Imperishable be his name ! Like that unchanging star which led him on his stormy way, the splendor of his triumph will know no going down. In undiminished bright ness will it shine as ages pass away. In his career on earth Columbus had been called to taste the bitter and the sweet, had known the rapture of success and the sharp sting of base ingratitude, and, saddest to tell, had died in want and woe. But Time has garnered up his glory. No other navigator can claim to have discovered ' ' The New World \" ; it was he alone who opened the gates of the morn ing and flooded the trackless deep with everlasting light. When Columbus had rent the veil which hid this great reserve of Nature, he beheld upon its shores a savage race, a race perhaps washed on the American Continent by a later wave of migration, from that great nursery of the world, old Asia. Columbus called these people \"Indians,\" believing that the islands he had struck were but the outer fringes of the India which he sought. Though this illusion has been long dispelled, the names he gave remain. \"In dians ' ' and ' ' West Indies ' ' abide as way-marks in the prog ress of mankind. And now, no sooner had the existence of a trans- Atlantic continent become assured, than Western Europe rose to seize the prize. Spain, having sent Columbus on his cour ageous voyage, prepared to take advantage of his finding, and soon acquired much territory in the South. France spread her canvas too for conquest, and planted her banner in the \u2022Note A, Appendix."], [37, "INTRODUCTION. 5 frozen North. But between these two dominions lay a vast and unclaimed territory. Thither sent England her daring Cabot and his sons, who landed on the New World, planted the royal standard upon her virgin coasts, and laid an empire at Britannia's feet \u2014 an empire stretching from the ice-clad regions of the snow-king to the beauty, and fragrance, and opulence of the land of the sun ; whose Western and whose Eastern coast lines are washed each by a majestic ocean, and whose hidden and incalculable wealth made it at once the El Dorado of hope and of fruition. The patent conferred on John Cabot by Henry VII. is the \"most ancient American state paper of England.\" The style of the commission is : \" Johanni Cabotto, Civi Venetiarum, ac Ludovico, Sebas tiano, et Sancto, Filiis dicti Johannis, etc.\" It is dated March 5th, in the eleventh year of the reign of Henry VII. Although John Cabot came from Venice, the place of his birth is unknown, and on his second voyage to America all trace of him is lost. But his name will adorn the annals of England so long as the Dominion of Canada exists, and the grand Banks of Newfoundland pour their pounds and shil lings into British coffers. These banks are one of the treas uries of the ocean, and the most valuable fishing grounds in the world. It was in this wise that John Cabot took possession of the country. He came in his first voyage upon the Western Continent, June 24, 1497, about latitude fifty-six degrees, among the dismal cliffs of Labrador. He ran along the coast for many leagues, and finally decided to land at a point which he called Prima Vista. This is generally acceded to be the island of Newfoundland. Here he erected a large cross with the flag of England on it ; and from affection for the 'Republic of Venice he added also the banner of St. Mark. But seventy-nine years were suffered to pass away before England, from causes adverse to the extension of industry, trade, and navigation, again turned to her possessions in the \u2022Note B, Appendix."], [38, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 6 New World. In 1576, Elizabeth, Queen of England, sent out Martin Frobisher for the discovery of a northwest pass age; failing in his effort, he returned to England, from whence he was sent again in 1577 to explore further the coast of Labrador and Greenland. Finding his search an unavailing task, he sailed for home, and in 1578 returned to America with the design of forming a settlement in the north ernmost part of the continent. In this plan he was also thwarted, and the supposed gold, which had been found in such abundance in glittering stones and sand, proved as delusive as the hope of establishing a home in that inhospita ble land. Still Elizabeth, dazzled by dreams of finding the precious ore in the ice-clad regions of the North and a mine of wealth in the fisheries of Newfoundland, readily granted a patent to Sir Humphrey Gilbert, one of her adventurous subjects, authorizing him to discover and take possession of all remote and barbarous lands, unoccupied by any Christian prince or people. She vested in him, his heirs and assigns forever, the full right of property in the soil of those countries of which he should take possession, to hold of the crown of England by homage, on payment of the fifth part of the gold or silver ore found there ; conferred complete jurisdiction within the said lands and seas adjoining them ; declared that all who should settle there should enjoy all the privileges of free citizens and natives of England, any law, custom, or usage to the contrary notwithstanding, and prohibited all persons from attempting to settle within 200 leagues of any place which Sir Humphrey Gilbert or his associates should have occupied during the space of six years. Gilbert soon after prepared to put to sea with a considera ble fleet ; but dissensions arose and he was deserted by some of his associates. He set sail, however, yet losing one of his ships in a storm he returned to England, and the effort proved abortive. On this adventure he was accompanied by his half-brother, Sir Walter Ralegh. In 1583 Gilbert equipped a new squadron and embarked under happier aus pices. He sailed for Newfoundland June 11, and in August, entering St. John's harbor, he summoned the Spaniards and"], [39, "INTRODUCTION. 7 Portuguese to witness the ceremonies by which he was to take possession of the country for his sovereign. When assembled, his commission was read and interpreted to the foreigners. A turf and twig were then delivered to him, and proclamation was immediately made that by virtue of his commission from the Queen, he took possession of the har bor of St. John and 200 leagues every way around it, for the crown of England. Not far from this place a pillar was erected, upon which were \"infixed the armes of England.\" This formal possession, in consequence of the voyage of the Ctbots, is considered by the English as the foundation of the right and title of the crown of England to the territory of Newfoundland and to the fishery upon its banks. But Gilbert was not destined to enjoy the reward of his enterprise and courage. On his return voyage the little Squirrel which he commanded \u2014 a bark of ten tons only \u2014 foundered at midnight in a fierce gale at sea, and ship nor crew were ever seen again. The Hind one of the fleet, reached home in safety, and her captain, Edward Haies, detailed the sad disaster. But Sir Walter Ralegh, undaunted by the tragic fate of Gilbert, resolved to make the desperate venture once again. Observing that the Spaniards had not yet occupied a vast extent of territory north of the Gulf of Mexico, he hoped by planting a colony there to thwart the Spanish and the French from gaining entire possession of the continent. Ever since the arrival in England, in 1565, of the Huguenots who had escaped massacre in Florida by the Spaniards, the knowl edge of the increasing power of Rome in America had been growing. This may have been one reason which lured the Protestant Elizabeth to seek a permanent settlement there ; but it is certain that the reputed mines of gold in the new country had much to do with energizing the project. So Sir Walter Ralegh, young, accomplished, and in favor with the Queen, had little difficulty in obtaining her consent to fit out another expedition. She gave to Ralegh a patent with pre rogatives and jurisdictions as ample as had been granted to his brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert."], [40, "8 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA.

Anno 1584. The expedition thus inaugurated consisted of two ships, the one commanded by Philip Amidas, and the other by Arthur Barlow. They sailed from England on the 27th of April, 1584, and on July 4th following, arrived on the coast of America. Here, somewhat north of the West Indies and opposite what was afterwards called \"Carolina,\" on the island of Wocoken, the southernmost of the islands forming Ocracoke Inlet, they lifted the British flag and took possession of the country in the name of Queen Elizabeth.

Little dreamed they how it"], [45, "IN TROD UCTION. 13 called upon the realms of Night to yield the sceptre of her ebon throne and let the Day come in ; how it bid the Arcana of Nature to give up to Science and to Art their hoarded wealth ; how it opened a way for the progress of Christianity, and spread out a land of light and freedom destined to become one of the first powers, \"In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world In September, 1584, upon their return from this voyage of discovery, Amidas and Barlow gave such splendid descrip tions of the beauty and fertility of the country, the mildness of the climate, and of the gentleness of the aborigines, that Elizabeth, delighted with the idea of occupying so fine a ter ritory, bestowed upon it the name of \"Virginia,\" as a memo rial that this happy acquisition was made under a virgin Queen. Thus did this imperial domain await the hour when, in the providence of God, it was conceded to the mighty forces at work among mankind, predestined to a Titanic progress under the Anglo-Saxon race, beneath the equal sway of law and liberty. Twice did Sir Walter Ralegh endeavor to plant a colony upon the shores of the New World. On the island of Roa noke, not far from \" Wocoken,\" in 1585 and 1587, he made these efforts, but failed in both attempts. Having thus expended many thousand pounds in vain, he used the privi lege of his patent March 7, 1589, to endow a company of mer chants and adventurers with large concessions, and this act was the connecting link between the first efforts on Roanoke Island and the final colonization of Virginia. The new instrument ( ' ' An indenture made between Sir Walter Ralegh, Chief Governor of Virginia, on the one part, and Thomas Smith, etc., etc., of the other part, witnesseth, etc.,\") was not an assignment of Ralegh's patent, but the ex tension of a grant already held under its sanction, by increas ing the number to whom the right of that charter belonged.

Although Sir Walter Ralegh was not permitted to see his own personal schemes realized, they yet stamp him as the author of the Plantation idea in Virginia, and the pioneer in that great \"Westward Ho,\" which still rings in the ears of civilized Europe. \u00ab"], [47, "I 15 SIR WALTER RALEGH. Chief Governor of Virginia and Founder of Roanoke Colony. 1585- Sir Walter Ralegh, an illustrious Englishman, was born at Hayes, in the parish of Budley, Devonshire, in 1552. He was for some time at Oriel College, Oxford, but the pur suits of ambition and an active life were more congenial to his tastes than academic labors. So at the age of seventeen he commenced his career as a soldier, being one of a number of volunteers sent by Elizabeth to France to support the Protestants. Here he remained nearly six years, when he returned to England, and in 1578 embarked for the Nether lands with the troops sent against the Spaniards. On get ting home from this expedition, he found that his half brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, had just obtained a patent for establishing a plantation in America, and into this scheme Ralegh entered with enthusiasm. They put to sea in 1579, but one of their ships was lost, and the remainder were crip pled in an engagement with a Spanish fleet, so they came back without making land. Ralegh now began a career of brilliant services to his country and mankind. In his military life in Ireland his bravery and intelligence were so conspicuous in quelling the insurgents, that he was received at court with unusual favor, and it is narrated that his position there was much strength ened by an act of knightly gallantry rendered personally to the Queen. One day as her Majesty was walking, the party came upon a muddy path, whereat the courtly Ralegh laid"], [48, "16 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. his mantle at his sovereign's feet for her to step on. Eliza beth, struck anew at the polished courtesy of her subject, made him a knight indeed, and rewarded his many loyal and distinguished services by several lucrative grants, in cluding a large share of the forfeited estates in Ireland. Ralegh, whose talents only needed opportunity, now soon rose to positions of honor and distinction in the royal service. One of the most interesting subjects which occupied his active mind was the colonization of ' ' The New World ' ' by the English people. Sir Humphrey Gilbert's mother was the mother also, by a second marriage, of Sir Walter Ralegh, and it was this elder brother's zeal for seeking \"summer isles\" that first fired the heart of Ralegh \"To sail beyond the sunset and the baths Of all the western stars ' ' in search of riches, fame, and power. On March 25, 1584, Ralegh obtained from Elizabeth an ample patent and the title of Lord Proprietor over an exten sive region in America, which the Queen subsequently called \"Virginia.\" Here, he made two unsuccessful attempts to found a colony, but his zeal in this matter was full of conse quence and will never be forgotten in the annals of the early settlement of America. When England was threatened by the Spanish Armada, Ralegh joined the fleet with a squadron of ships belonging to gentlemen volunteers, and contributed signally to the vic tory which it pleased Providence to grant the English over the Spaniards. He was now advanced at court, but, unfort unately, fell after a time into disfavor with the Queen. His success in the expedition to Cadiz, however, where his valor and prudence contributed so largely to a victorious result, combined with other important services, restored him to the partiality of his Queen. But Ralegh's bravery, distinguished abilities, and great enterprise made him the object of envy as well as of admiration. Queen Elizabeth conferred honors upon him, but her succes-"], [49, "SIR WALTER RALEGH. 17 sor sent him to the Tower. During a long confinement there of thirteen years he wrote his \"History of the World,\" a book of unusual finish and erudition ; and his contributions made from time to time to general literature were numerous and valuable. In March, 1615, he was liberated from prison, but not pardoned. A last unsuccessful venture in Guiana was the culmination of his disastrous efforts to redeem his for tunes. Having failed to find the gold on which so much depended, he returned to England in 1618, broken in hope and health. Soon afterwards he was arrested, and to please the Spanish, King James suffered the sentence of death to be executed on him. Ralegh's life had been full of vicissitude, and after many triumphs and many failures, much honor and much misfor tune, he finally finished his chequered course on the scaffold in Old Palace Yard, London, October 29, 1618. His behavior at the end was calm, and after addressing the people in his own justification he received the stroke of death with perfect composure. He remarked to the executioner, with a smile, as he felt the edge of the axe with his hand, \"This is a sharp medicine, but it is one that will cure all diseases.\" The following beautiful tribute to Ralegh is paid by the distinguished American historian, George Bancroft : \"The name of Ralegh stands highest among the statesmen of Eng land who advanced the colonization of the United States. Courage which was never daunted, mild self-possession, and fertility of invention, insured him glory in his profession of arms, and his services in the conquest of Cadiz and the capture of Fayal established his fame as a gallant and suc cessful commander. \" No soldier in retirement ever expressed the charms of tranquil leisure more beautifully than Ralegh, whose 'sweet verse' Spencer described as ' sprinkled with nectar ' and rivalling the melodies of ' the summer's nightingale. ' When an unjust verdict left him to languish for years in prison, with the sentence of death suspended over his head, his active genius plunged into the depths of erudition ; and he who had been a warrior, a courtier, and a seaman, became the author of an elaborate 'History of the World.' In his civil career he was thoroughly an English patriot; jealous of the honor, the prosperity, and the advance- n"], [50, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 18 ment of his country ; the steadfast antagonist of the exorbitant preten sions of Spain. In parliament, he defended the freedom of domestic industry. When, through unequal legislation, taxation was a burden upon industry rather than wealth, he argued for a change ; himself pos sessed of a lucrative monopoly, he gave his voice for the repeal of all monopolies; he used his influence with his sovereign to mitigate the severity of the judgments against the non-conformists, and as a legislator he resisted the sweeping enactment of persecuting laws. \"In the career of discovery, his perseverance was never baffled by losses. He joined in the risks of Gilbert's expedition; contributed to that of Davis in the northwest, and explored in person 'the insular regions and broken world ' of Guiana. His lavish efforts in colonizing the soil of our republic, his sagacity which enjoined a settlement within the Chesapeake Bay, the publications of Hariot and Hakluyt which he countenanced, diffused over England a knowledge of America, as well as an interest in its destinies, and sowed the seeds of which the fruits were to ripen during his life-time, though not for him. \" Ralegh had suffered in health before his last expedition. He re turned broken-hearted by the defeat of his hopes, by the decay of his strength, and by the death of his eldest son. What shall be said of King James, who would open to an aged paralytic no other hope of liberty but through success in the discovery of mines in Guiana? What shall be said of a monarch who could, at that time, under a sentence which had slum bered for fifteen years, order the execution of a decrepit man, whose genius and valor shone through the ravages of physical decay, and whose English heart still beat with an undying love for his country? \" After the lapse of two long centuries, the state of North Carolina revived in its capital the. name of this chief author of early colonization in the United States, and future genera tions in America will cherish the memory of Sir Walter Ralegh not only as the founder of Virginia, but as one whose laws should \"be not against the true, Christian faith nowe professed in the Church of England.\" To him belongs the meed of making here the wilderness and the solitary place glad, and of opening a way for the desert \"to rejoice and blossom as a rose.\""], [51, "II. RALPH LANE. Governor of Raleglis ist Colony 1585-1586 Ralph Lane, second son of Sir Ralph Lane, of Orling bury, and his wife Maud, daughter of William, Lord Parr (uncle of Queen Catherine Parr), was born in North amptonshire about 1530; entered the Queen's service in 1563, and was so much esteemed by Elizabeth for his services as a soldier that she knighted him. In 1585 Sir Walter Ralegh sent out from England a fleet of seven sail, with people to form a settlement in Virginia, deputing Sir Richard Grenville to be General of the expedition and Mr. Ralph Lane to be Governor of the Colony. This was the first English settle ment ever planted in America, and was established on Roanoke Island. It consisted of 107 persons, under the government of Lane. The colonists suffered great dangers from the machi nations of the Indians, who at first intended to starve them by abandoning them, and leaving the island unsown. Foiled here, they next formed a conspiracy for the general massacre of the colonists. This, however, was frustrated by the vigilance of the English Governor, who contrived a counterplot, in execution of which Pemisapan, the wicked son of the good old Indian king, Ensenore, was slain on June 1, 1586. Unable, however, to contend with hostile Indians and want of provisions, the whole Colony returned to England June 18, 1586.

Thus terminated the first English colony planted in America. The only acquisition made by this expensive experiment was a knowledge of \"the weed,\" and a better acquaintance with the country and its inhabitants."], [53, "III. JOHN WHITE. Governor of Ralegh1 :s 2d Colony. 1587- On April 26, 1587, Sir Walter Ralegh, intent on planting the territory of Virginia within his patent (it was \"to con tinue the space of six years, and no more \") sent out another company of 150 adventurers. He incorporated them by the name, \" The Borough of Ralegh in Virginia,\" and consti tuted John White, Governor, in whom, with a council of twelve persons, the legislative power was vested; and they were directed to plant at the Bay of Chesapeake and to erect a fort there. They, however, landed at Roanoke, July 22, and commenced a second plantation. On August 13, Manteo, a friendly Indian, was baptized in Roanoke, and according to a previous order of Sir Walter Ralegh was called, Lord of Roanoke. On the 18th of August, Mrs. Dare, daughter of the Governor, gave birth to a daughter in Roanoke, and on the next Lord's day the infant was baptized \" Virginia,\" being the first English child born in the country. On the 27th of August, at the urgent solicitation of the whole Colony, the Governor sailed for England to procure supplies, but of his countrymen who remained behind, nothing was ever after wards known. Governor White, though personally detained in England (being of the Queen's Council and the country threatened with war), sent in 1588 supplies for the relief of the Colony, but this expedition, more intent on taking prizes than in sailing to Virginia, was finally disabled and rifled by two men of war and was compelled to put back for England. In 1590, however, Governor White, being at liberty to return to his Colony, sailed March 20 from Plymouth with 31"], [54, "JOHN WHITE. 22 three ships and wTent to the place where he had left the English settlers. Coming to this landing point, he found on a tree at the top of the bank, CRO carved in distinct Roman letters, but the cross, the sign of distress, was wanting ; further on they found carved on a tree, CROATOAN. This Croatoan was an Indian town on the north side of Cape Lookout, and thither Governor White determined to sail next day, but a violent storm arose and being short of water and provisions they went back to England. It is said that Ralegh sent out five times, at his own charges, to the succor of the Colony left in Virginia in 1587. Other efforts were also made to search for these lost emigrants, but all to no avail. Their fate was never known, and so ended in tragic eclipse Sir Walter Ralegh's enterprise for settling the New World. The Governor of this last ill-starred effort, John White, came first to Virginia with Governor Lane in 1585, and was always interested in this initial work. Though White's Colony met with such a doubtful fate in his absence, he sought again and again to find some traces of it, and was conspicuous in his concern in the adventure of settling America. He was a good artist, made maps of the various portions of Virginia which he visited and drawings of the inhabitants, etc. Some of his paintings are now in the Sloane collec tion and in the Greenville Library, British Museum."], [55, "IV SIR THOMAS SMITH. First President of the London Company, and its Treasurer. 1605-1607. King James I., having recently made peace with Spain, and the passion for the discovery of a northwest passage being now in its full vigor, a ship was sent out with a view to this purpose by the Earl of Southampton and Lord Arundel, under the command of Capt. George Weymouth. He sailed from England on the last of March, 1605, and remained a month exploring the American coast. The discovery of which he seems to have been proudest was that of the Penobscot River. On his return to England he took with him five Indians, three of whom he yielded to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the Governor of the town of Plymouth, whose attention was thus addressed to the New World. The information Gorges gathered from Weymouth filled him with the strongest desire to become a proprietary of lands beyond the Atlantic. His influence, with that of Sir John Popham, Lord Chief Justice of England, and the combined enthusiasm of the assigns of Ralegh, were the means employed by Providence to induce King James I. to set his seal to the patent of April 10, 1606. He divided that portion of North America which stretches from the 34th to the 45th degree of north latitude into two districts, nearly equal. The southern, called the First Colony, he granted to the Lon- don Company ; the northern, called the Second Colony, he granted to the Plymouth Company. He authorized Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Somers, Richard Hakluyt, Edward Maria Wingfield, and their associates, chiefly resi dent in London, to settle any part that they should choose of the southern district, and vested in them a right of prop- 28"], [56, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 24 erty to the land extending along the coast fifty miles on each side of the place of their first habitation, and reaching into the interior country ioo miles.

Sir Thomas Smith, chief of the assignees of the patent of Sir Walter Ralegh, was the first President of the Coun cil of the London Company of Virginia, and its Treasurer until the close of 1618. His services in establishing a Colony in Virginia, and thus securing a foothold for England in"], [58, "26 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. America, cannot be overestimated, and a history of the fac tions in the Virginia Company after this period of its earliest inauguration, will show the storms and struggles through which the infant Colony began its life. Sir Thomas Smith was the third son of Thomas Smith, commonly called ' ' Mr. Customer Smith,\" and Alice, daughter and heiress of Sir Andrew Judde, Lord Mayor of London (by whom he acquired the manors of Ashford and Westure) . Sir Thomas Smith was born about 1558, was educated at Oxford, and at an early age became a prominent man. It is greatly to be regretted that the history of Sir Thomas Smith's administration of affairs in Virginia rests almost entirely upon the adverse testimony of his opponents. But that his services were recognized by the crown, is to be seen in the fact that in the second charter to ' ' The Treasurer and Company of Adventurers and Planters of the City of London for the First Colony in Virginia,\" he was named as one of \"our Council for the said Company.\" ' ' And the said Thomas Smith we do ordain to be Treas urer of the said Company, which Treasurer shall have authority to give order for the warning of the Council and summoning the Company to their courts and meetings.\" That the distant colonists may have had their grievances is true, as is related in \" A Briefe Declaration of the Planta tion of Virginia Duringe the First Twelve Yeares, when Sir Thomas Smith was Governor of the Companie, and downe to the present tyme\" (1621), but, the conclusion is inevitable that Sir Thomas Smith had much to do with the permanent establishment of the Virginia Colony. He was Treasurer and Governor of the Company during the first twelve years, which ended the 18th of November, 1618, and his administration was confined to a presidency of the Council and Company in England, while the affairs of the Colony were managed by one of the Council resident there. He was never actually Gov ernor in Virginia. It was on March 9, 1607, that King James I. issued the following : ' ' An Ordinance and Constitution enlarging the number of"], [59, "SIR THOMAS SMITH. 27 our Councel for the two several Colonies and Plantations in Virginia and America, between thirty-four and forty-five de grees of northerly latitude, and augmenting their authority, for the better directing and ordering of such things as shall concerne the said Colony.\"* Sir Thomas Smith died Sept. 4, 1625, at his house at Tunbridge, and was buried under a most superb monument in Hone Church, Kent. The following inscription will give some idea of the scope of his usefulness, and the honors which he won : \"To the glory of God, and to the pious memorie of the honorable Sir Thomas Smith, Knt.

On the reception of the patent from King James, April 10, 1606, several persons of consequence in the English nation undertook the arduous task of planting the Southern Col ony. Having chosen a Treasurer, and appointed other offi cers, they provided a fleet of three ships to transport the emigrants, 100 in number, to Virginia. The charge of this embarkation was committed to Christopher Newport, already famous for his skill in western navigation, who sailed from the Thames on the 20th of December, carrying with him the royal instructions and the names of the intended Colonial Council, carefully concealed in a box. It was the intention of Captain Newport to land at Roanoke, but being driven by a violent storm to the northward of that place, he stood directly into the spacious Bay of Chesapeake, which seemed to invite his entrance. The promontory on the south of the bay he named Cape Henry, in honor of the Prince of Wales, and that on the north Cape Charles, in honor of the Duke of York, afterward King Charles I. of England. Thirty men going on shore at Cape Henry for recreation were suddenly assaulted by five Indians, who wounded two of them very dangerously. At night the box was opened and the orders were read, in which Bartholomew Gosnold, John Smith, Edward Wingfield, Christopher Newport, John Ratcliffe, John Martin, and George Kendall were named to be of the Council, and to choose from their number a President for a year, who, with the Council, should govern the Colony. The adventurers were employed in seeking a"], [61, "EDWARD MARIA WINGFIELD. 29 place for settlement until the 13th of May, when they took possession of a peninsula on the north side of the river Pow hatan (called by the English, James River), about forty miles from its mouth. To make room for their projected town, they here began to cut down the trees of the forest, which had for centuries afforded shelter and food to the natives. The code of laws, hitherto cautiously concealed, was at length promulgated. Affairs of moment were to be exam ined by a jury, but determined by the major part of the Council, in which the President was to have two voices. The Council was sworn, Wingfield was chosen President, and ' ' now commenced the rule of the most ancient administration of Virginia, consisting of seven persons, and forming a pure aristocracy.\" In honor of King James, they called the town they now built, Jamestown. \"Captain Edward Maria Wingfield, of Stoneley Priorye\" in Huntingdonshire, was born 1560. He commenced life as a soldier and was a prisoner of war at Lisle with Ferdinando Gorges, where probably their friendship began, which resulted in a closer association in the colonizing of Virginia . Wingfield was elected, May 4, 1607, the first President of the first Council of the first permanent English Colony in America, but becom ing obnoxious to the Company he was deposed from the presi dency, September 10, 1607, and Captain Ratcliffe elected in his place. Wingfield was of a Catholic family. Cardinal Pole and Queen Mary were sponsors for his father. He left Vir ginia, April 10, 1608, and arrived in England, May 21, 1608. He wrote \"A Discourse of Virginia,\" which was first printed in 1860 by the American Antiquarian Society."], [62, "VI. JOHN RATCLIFFE. President of the Council in Virginia.

Many dissensions divided the Colony at this time and its history is a sad recital of rivalries and jealousies, privations and sufferings, among the settlers, and dangers seen and unseen from the treacherous Indians. It is said that Ratcliffe was ' ' betrayed and murdered by Powhatan in the winter of 1609-1610.\" In one of the man uscripts preserved by the remarkable Hakluyt, which came into the hands of the Rev. Samuel Purchas, and which was \"written by that honorable gentleman, Master George Percy,\" we read: \"The eleventh day (September, 1607) there was certain articles laid against Master Wingfield, which was then President ; thereupon he was not only displaced out of his Presidentship, but also from being of the Councell.

Captain John Smith, according to his own account, ' ' was born in Willoughby in Lincolneshire, and a scholler in the two free schooles of Alford and Louth. His father anciently descended from the ancient Smiths of Crudley in Lancashire, his mother from the Rickands at great Heck in Yorkshire. His parents dying when he was about thirteene years of age, left him a competent means, which hee not being capable to manage little regarded ; his minde being even then set upon brave adventures, sould his satchell, books, and all he had, intending secretly to get to sea, but that his father's death stayed him.\" In the register of the Willoughby Rectory is found an entry of the baptism of John, son of George Smith, under date of January 9, 1579. Peculiarly courageous, restless, and fond of adventure, he left his native country at the age of fifteen, traveled in France, and served in the Netherlands, a soldier in the cause of liberty. After having returned to England and devoted some attention to military tactics and history, he went again to France and embarked thence for Italy with a company of Pilgrims, who, regarding him as a heretic, threw him into the sea near a small island off Nice, to calm a tem- pest by which they were overtaken. He swam to the shore and proceeded to Alexandria. In returning, he entered the service of Hungary against the Turks, where he soon distin guished himself and obtained the command of a body of horse. At the siege of Regal, a Turkish nobleman sending a chal lenge to fight with any Christian captain who would venture a contest for the amusement of the ladies, Smith accepted"], [64, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 32 the offer, and meeting his antagonist on horseback bore away his head, and gained a similar victory in a second and third contest. For this exploit he was given a coat of arms, as seen by the following : \" Sigismundus Bathor, by the Grace of God, Duke of Transilvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia, Earle of Anchard, Salford and Growenda ; to whom this Writing may come or appeare. Know that We have given leave and licence to John Smith, an English Gentleman, Captaine of 250 Soul diers, under the most Generous and Honourable Henry Volda, Earl of Meldritch, Salmaria, and Peldvia, Colonell of a thousand horse, and fifteen hundred foot, in the warres of Hungary, and in the provinces aforesaid under our author ity; whose service doth deserve all praise and perpetuall memory towards us, as a man that did for God and his Country overcome his enemies : Wherefore out of Our love and favour, according to the law of Armes, We have ordained and given him in his shield of Armes, the figure and description of three Turks' heads, which with his sword before the towne of Regall, in single combat he did overcome, kill, and cut off, in the Province of Transilvania.\" Captain Smith was afterwards taken prisoner by the Turks, and sold as a slave. Escaping from this tyranny, he traveled much in Northern Europe, passed into Spain, and finally went to Morocco. From thence he returned to Eng land. Aged about 26 and full of experience and honors, he eagerly joined in the great drama of discovery and adventure in which he found some of his countrymen engaged. He entered with enthusiasm into the project of colonizing the New World, and with Newport, Gosnold, Ratcliffe, Wing field, Hunt, and others, set out in December, 1606, with a squadron of three small vessels for Virginia, under the authority of a charter granted by James I. The Sarah Con stant, in charge of Captain Christopher Newport, the com mander of the expedition, carried seventy-one men ; the Godspeed, in charge of Captain Bartholomew Gosnold, carried fifty-two men, and the Discovery, a pinnace, in charge of John Ratcliffe, carried twenty men. They landed May 13th, at"], [65, "CAPTAIN fOHN SMITH. 33 Jamestown. Amidst the unhappy dissensions, difficulties, and distresses of the first years of the great enterprise, Smith rendered the most important services by his irrepressible hopefulness, his practical wisdom, and his vigorous govern ment. But for his wisdom and noble exertions the project would probably have been abandoned. He made important geographical explorations and discoveries. In 1607, ascend ing the Chickahominy and penetrating into the interior of the country, he and his comrades were captured by the Indians, and he only, by his rare self-possession, escaped with life. He remained a prisoner for some weeks, carefully observed the country, got some knowledge of the language of the natives, and when at last they were going to put him to death, he was saved by the affectionate pleading of Pocahontas, the daughter of the chief Powhatan, a girl ten or twelve years old. Reconducted to Jamestown, Smith had need for all his energy to save the desponding colonists. In the summer of 1608 he explored in an open boat the Bay of the Chesa peake and its tributary rivers, a navigation of nearly 3000 miles. He also penetrated inland, established friendly rela tions with the Indians, and prepared a map of the country. On his return from this wonderful expedition, he was made President of the Colonial Council. In 1609 he was severely injured by an accidental explosion of gunpowder, and without reward for his splendid services, except in his own conscience and the applause of the world, returned to England. Three times had Smith prevented the abandonment of the Colony, preserved it from starvation and destruction for nearly three years, and had left it, on a change of administration, in a condition to take care of itself with judicious management. This great work, accomplished in a new settlement rent by intestine dissensions and threatened hourly with destruction by a wily and powerful foe, would surely entitle the author of it, to be called \"The Father of the Colony.\" It was during Captain Smith's term of office as President of the Colonial Council that King James I. granted \"The second Charter to the Treasurer and Company, for Virginia, erecting them into a corporation and Body Politic, and for in"], [66, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 34 the further enlargement and explanation of the privileges of the said Company and First Colony of Virginia.\"* Having returned to England in a torn and bleeding state from his injury, in the autumn of 1609, Captain Smith remained there until March 3, 1614, when he set sail on a voyage of dis covery to North Virginia. He ranged the coast east and west from Penobscot to Cape Cod, and bartered with the natives for beaver and other furs. By this voyage he made a profit of nearly From the observations which he now made, on shores, islands, harbors, and headlands, he on his return home formed a map, and presented it to Prince Charles, who, in the warmth of admiration, declared that the country should be called New England. Smith in this voyage made several discoveries, and distin guished them by peculiar names. The northern promontory of Massachusetts Bay, forming the eastern entrance into the bay, he named Tragabigzanda, in honor of a Turkish lady to whom he had been formerly a slave at Constantinople. Prince Charles, however, in filial respect to his mother, called it Cape Ann, a name which it still retains. The three small islands lying at the head of the promontory, Smith called the \"Three Turks' Heads,\" in memory of his victory over three Turkish champions ; but this name has also been changed. Another cluster of islands, to which the discoverer gave his own name, \"Smith's Isles,\" was afterwards denominated \"The Isles of Shoals,\" and still retains that name. On one of these isles (Star Island), erected on the southerly summit, stands a marble shaft in honor of John Smith. Encouraged by commercial success, Smith, in 161 5, in the employment of Sir Ferdinando Gorges and of friends in Lon don who were members of the Plymouth Company, endeavored to establish a colony in New England. Sixteen men were all whom the adventurers destined for this occupation. The attempt was unsuccessful. Smith was forced by violent storms to return. Again renewing his enterprise, he suffered from the treachery of his companions, and was intercepted by I.argeD\"tvo.Mia,yp.2^(Vfir5ginfaTS \"'' SUth'S APP\" No\" * HeBil'*'S \" StatUteS at"], [67, "CAPTAIN fOHN SMITH. 35 French pirates. His ship having been taken away, he him self escaped alone, in an open boat, from the harbor of Rochelle. The severest privations in a new settlement would have been less wearisome than the labors which his zeal now prompted him to undertake. Having published a map and a description of New England, he spent many months in 1617 visiting the merchants and gentry of the West of England, to excite their enterprise. He proposed to the cities, mercantile profits to be realized in short and safe voyages ; to the noble men, vast dominions ; from men of small means, his earnest ness concealed the hardships of emigrants, and upon the dark ground drew a lively picture of the rapid advancement of for tune by colonial industry, of the abundance of game, the delights of unrestrained liberty, and the pleasures to be derived from ' ' angling and crossing the sweet air from isle to isle over the silent streams of a calm sea.\" The Company began now to form vast plans of colonization ; Smith was appointed Admiral of the country for life, and a renewal of the letters patent, with powers analogous to those possessed by the Southern Company, became an object of eager solicitation. But a new charter was not obtained without vigorous opposi tion. After two years' entreaty, the ambitious adventurers gained everything which they had solicited, and in Novem ber, 1620, King James issued to forty of his subjects, some of them members of his household and his government, the most wealthy and powerful of the English nobility, a patent, which in American annals, and even in the history of the world, has scarcely a parallel . The adventurers and their successors were incorporated as \"The Council established at Plymouth, in the County of Devon, for the planting, ruling, ordering, and gov erning New England, in America.\" Smith never lived to see, even partially realized, his hopes of colonization in South or North Virginia. He demonstrated the power of enthusiasm in accomplishing great ends, but like many another hero, he fell unhonored while his work went on. For twenty years he was a voluminous writer, and with his sword and pen laid the foundations of the noble commonwealth of Virginia, whose glory will ever shed luster on his name."], [68, "36 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. \"Captain John Smith died unmarried, nor is there any record that he ever had wife or children.

Captain John Smith, in an open barge, with fourteen persons and a very scanty stock of pro visions, explored the whole of that great extent of water, from Cape Henry where it meets with the ocean to the river Susquehanna ; trading with some tribes of Indians, and fighting with others. He discovered and named many small islands, creeks, and inlets ; sailed up many of the great rivers ; and explored the inland parts of the country. Smith after sailing about 3,000 miles, returned to Jamestown. Having made careful obseryations during this excursion of discovery, he drew a map of Chesapeake Bay and of the rivers, annexing to it a description of the countries, and of the nations inhabiting them, and sent it to the Council in England ; and this map was made with such admirable exactness that it is the original from which all subsequent maps and descriptions of Virginia have been chiefly copied. His superior abilities obtained the ascendency over envy and faction. Although he had lately been refused a seat at the Council board, he was now, by the election of the Council and the request of the settlers, invested with the government, and received letters patent to be President of the Colony. The wisdom of his administration infused con fidence ; its vigor commanded obedience.\" \u2014 Annals oj America, by Abiel Holmes. \" Captain Smith, who next to Sir Walter Ralegh may be considered as the founder of our Colony, has written its history from the first adven tures to it, till the year 1624.

When I went first to Virginia, I well remember, we did hang an awning (which is an old sail) to three or four trees, to shadow us from the sun ; our walls were rails of wood, our seats unhewed trees till we cut planks, our pulpit a bar of wood nailed to two neighboring trees ; in foul weather we shifted into an old rotten tent, for we had few better; and this came by way of adventure for new.

His maps of the countries he visited, and descriptions of their inhabit ants, are acknowledged by all writers to be remarkably accurate, and the estimation in which he was held by those who knew hinr best is admira bly expressed by one of the writers in the ' Oxford Tract, ' upon the occa sion of his departure from the Colony, in these words: 'What shall I saye, but thus we lost him ; that in all his proceedings made justice his first guide, and experience his second, ever hating basenesse, sloth, pride, and indignitie more than any dangers ; that never allowed more for him selfe than for his soldiers with him ; that upon no danger would send them where he would not lead them himselfe ; that would never see us want what he either had or could by any means get us ; that would rather want than borrow, or starve than not pay ; that loved action more than wordes, and hated falsehood and covetousness worse than death ; whose adventures were our lives, and whose losse our deathes.

But the far-reaching genius of Smith saw in the fertile soil and mild climate of Virginia the provision by Providence for a great people, and he set himself resolutely to the work of bringing into subjection the native tribes, and of making the Col ony self-supporting. He rebuked the London Company for their threat to abandon the Colony, he defeated the efforts to abandon the settlement at the risk of his life, he forced the men to labor, and he taught them how to hold the Indians in subjection and to get from them needed provisions. In a word, he demonstrated the practicability of the enterprise. Years afterward, and when, through his exertions in a great measure, Virginia had been successfully planted, he pictured the miseries through which they had passed who planted it, and his entire devotion of himself to its interests, in these words: ' By that acquaintance I have with them, I call them my children, for they have been my wife, my hawks, hounds, my cards, my dice, and in totall my best content, as indifferent to my heart as my left hand to my right ; and notwithstanding all those miracles of dis asters have crossed both them and me, yet were there not an Englishman"], [74, "42 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. remaining, as God be thanked, notwithstanding the nrassacre, there are some thousands, I would yet begin againe with as small nreanes as I did at first.'

Where is Smith, that pink of gallantry, that flower of chivalry ? I fancy that I can see their first slow and cautious approach to the shore ; their keen and vigilant eyes piercing the forest in every direction, to detect the lurking Indian, with his tomahawk, bow and arrow. Good Heavens ! what an enterprise ! how full of the most fearful perils ! and yet, how entirely profitless to the daring men who personally undertook and achieved it ! Through what a series of the most spirit chilling hardships had they to toil ! how often did they cast their eyes to England in vain ! and with what delusive hopes, day after day, did the little famished crew strain their sight to catch the white sail of comfort and relief! But day after day the sun set and darkness covered the earth, but no sail of comfort or relief came. How often in the pangs of hunger, sickness, solitude, and disconsolation did they think of London, her shops, her markets, groaning under the weight of plenty ; her streets swarming with gilded coaches, bustling hacks, with crowds of lords, dukes, and com mons ; with healthy, busy, contented faces of every description ; and among them none more healthy or more contented than those of their ungrateful and improvident directors ! \" \u2014 William Wirt, on Jamestown. \"Thus on the arrival of Captain Smith, the first founder of the Colony of Virginia,\" etc. \u2014 Thomas fefferson, Notes on the State oj Virginia. \"Parson Weems,\" of Virginia (who wrote a \"Life of Washington,\" which, according to the distinguished Vir ginia historian, John Esten Cooke, has \"gone through more editions and been read by more people than the Lives of Mar shall, Ramsay, Bancroft, and Irving put together\"), says: \"the souls of Columbus, Raleigh, and Smith looking down from heaven with joy beheld the consummation of all their labors and wishes.\" The beautiful story of the devotion of the Indian princess, Pocahontas, to the English Colony, deserves here more than a passing mention.

Her rescue of Captain John Smith from a cruel death has been perpetuated by the historian, the poet, the painter, and the sculptor, and the thrilling picture of the Indian girl rush ing between the victim and his fate, appealing to her impe rial father to spare the fatal blow, will ever remain a part of the early history of this country. Pure and simple-hearted she often forgot her own danger in her desire to inform the colonists of impending trouble. She forsook the wild rites of her savage tribe, embraced the Christian religion and was baptized and received into the Church under the name of Rebecca. She was united in holy matrimony with one of the colonists, Mr. John Rolfe, a man of high character and of great usefulness in the plantation. It is worthy of note that he was the originator of the culture of Virginia's great staple, tobacco, and one of the most active in developing the various resources of the country. The marriage of Pocahon tas with Rolfe brought peace with the Indians. Sir Thomas Dale, who was acting as Governor, carried her with her hus band and child to England in 1616, where she was hand somely entertained by the London Company and others, the Queen and the Court paying her marked attention. As she was about to return to Virginia, \"The Lady Rebecca,\" as she was called in London, died on shipboard at Gravesend, after a brief illness, March 21, 1617. She left one son, Thomas Rolfe, who was educated in England and became afterwards a person of note in Virginia. He was the founder of a distinguished family of whom the celebrated John Ran dolph was a descendant.

CAPTAIN GEORGE PERCY. President of the Council in Virginia. August, 1609, to May, 1610. President John Smith, enfeebled by an accident to his person from an explosion of powder, and requiring medical aid only to be obtained in England, returned thither towards the close of the year 1609, leaving three ships, seven boats, upwards of four hundred and ninety persons, twenty-four pieces of ordnance, three hundred muskets, with other arms and ammunition, one hundred well-trained and expert soldiers, a competent supply of working tools, live stock, and ten weeks' provisions. Jamestown was strongly palisaded, and con tained about sixty houses. Smith, for more than a year, had maintained his authority, and when forced to embark for England he delegated his office to Percy. But the colonists, no longer controlled by an acknowledged authority, abandoned themselves to improvident idleness. Nothing could have been more inauspicious for the Colony of Virginia than the departure of Captain Smith. The pro visions having been wasted after he left, a dreadful famine ensued, and prevailed to such extremity that this period was ever afterwards distinguished by the name of \"the starving time.\" Of nearly five hundred persons left in the Colony by the late President, sixty only remained at the expiration of six months. Captain George Percy passed through a trying experience. On the arrival of Sir Thomas Gates, May, 1610, the colonists insisted upon sailing for Newfoundland and burning behind them the town in which they had been so wretched. Gates prevented this, but they started on their sad return, and ' ' none dropped a tear, for none had enjoyed one dav of happi- n"], [77, "CAPTAIN GEORGE PERCY. 45 ness.\" On the 8th of June, 1610, they fell down the stream with the tide, but next morning they met Lord De la Warr, with emigrants and supplies, and he turned the faces of the fugitives once more towards the deserted Jamestown. It was on the 10th of June that the restoration of the Colony began. Under the second charter granted the London Company for Virginia, May 23, 1609, it was empowered to choose the Supreme Council in England, and under its instructions and regulations a Governor was provided, invested with absolute civil and military authority, with the title of \"Governor and Captain-General of Virginia. ' ' The resident council was still retained. Thomas West, Lord De la Warr, was appointed First Governor and Captain-General for life, May 23, 1609, but as he did not reach the Colony until June 10, 1610, Sir Thomas Gates was authorized to administer the affairs of the colony until the arrival of Lord De la Warr. When, therefore, Sir Thomas Gates arrived in Virginia, May 24, 1610, he superseded Captain George Percy, whose term of office had been such an eventful one. George Percy, eighth son of Henry, eighth Earl of North umberland, was born September 4, 1580; served for a time in the Low Countries; sailed for Virginia in the first expedition, December, 1606; was President of the Colony during \"the starving time,\" from August, 1609, to May, 1610, and when Lord De la Warr returned to England in March, 161 1, in recognition of Percy's former services, he was appointed Gov ernor until the arrival of Dale in May following. Percy left Virginia, April, 1612, went again to the Low Countries, where he distinguished himself as a soldier, was captain of a com pany in 1627, and died unmarried in 1632.

When Lord De la Warr was created Governor and Captain-General for life, in May, 1609, Sir Thomas Gates, with Newport and Sir George Somers, was authorized to administer the affairs of the Colony until the coming of Lord De la Warr. He accordingly assumed command on his arrival in May, 1610, and prevented the burning of Jamestown by the desperate colonists. But having consulted with Sir George Somers, Captain Newport, and the Council of the former government, they determined to abandon the country. This was prevented by the provi dential appearing of Lord De la Warr, who at once, June 10, 1610, assumed the reins of government.

Sir Thomas West, third Lord De la Warr, the first resident Governor-in-Chief of the Colony of Virginia, was born in 1579. He received this important appointment on ac count of his virtues as well as in consideration of his rank, for he was descended from a long line of noble ancestry. He assumed control of the Colony June 10, 1610. Having pub lished his commission, which invested him with the sole com mand, he appointed a Council of six persons to assist him in the administration. An essential change now took place in the form of the ancient Virginia Constitution ; the original aristocracy was converted into a rule of one, over whose deliberations the people had no control. Security returned to the Colony and prosperity appeared under the auspices of this intelligent and distinguished nobleman. But Lord De la Warr's health failing, he sailed March 28, 161 1, for the island of Nevis, for the benefit of the warm baths, leaving his Colony in the charge of Captain George Percy. His health improv ing somewhat, he desired to return to Virginia, but was per suaded to go to England. The settlement at this time con sisted of about two hundred men, but the Governor's departure produced great despondency.

He arrived in the Chesapeake, 17"], [80, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 48 May, 161 1 , and assumed the government, which he soon after wards administered upon the basis of martial law. In this year, 1611, Samuel Argall, exploring the neighbor ing coast to the north, at nine o'clock in the morning of the 27th of July, cast anchor in a very great bay, with many affluents, and gave it the name of Delaware. \"A short relation made by the Lord De la Warre, to the Lords and others of the Counsell of Virginia, touching his unexpected return home, and afterwards delivered, to the Generall Assembly of the said Company, at a court holden the twenty-five of June, 161 1, published by authority of the said Counsell, ' ' says : \" In the next place, I am to give accompt in what estate I left the Collony for government in my absence.

The code which he adopted, and which had been sent to Virginia by the Treasurer of the London Com pany, Sir Thomas Smith, was a severe one; but he sent let ters to England which induced Gates to bring over six ships, with three hundred emigrants, and this was a happy move for the colonists, who rejoiced with joy unspeakable at the approach of this friendly fleet. Gates assumed command, and the Colon}- numbered seven hundred men. Dale now went up the river to found two new plantations, one of which was named in honor of Prince Henry. He carried with him the Rev. Alexander Whittaker and three hundred and fifty men. One of the new positions was called New Bermuda, or what is now known as Bermuda Hundred, and the other, five or six miles higher up on the James, on the opposite side of the river, was located on Farrar's Island. This last was called Henrico City. In each of these places a church was built, and Mr. Whittaker was placed in charge of them. These were the first establishments after James City.

The return of Gates to Virginia at this time with recruits and supplies, brought a revival of hope to the colonists, who from that hour began to advance in strength and happiness. The greatest change in their condition resulted from the incipient establishment of private property. To each man a few acres of ground were assigned for his orchard and gar den, and henceforward the sanctity of private property was recognized. Agriculture enriched Virginia, and the stability of the Colony was no longer a matter of doubt. At this point we may exclaim with Michael Angelo, who inscribed at the base of one of his greatest works : ' ' No man hath knowledge how much blood this cost ! ' ' Through much tribulation, the settlement of America was assured, and on this remote frontier the Episcopal Church, coeval with the settlement of Jamestown, was established.

The earliest land laws, though imperfect and unequal, gave now the cultivator the means of becoming a proprietor of the soil. These changes were made by Sir Thomas Dale, who has gained much commendation for his zeal and good judgment in such matters. He returned to England in 1616, and took with him Mr. Rolfe and his wife, Pocahontas.

April, 1616, to May, 1617. Sir Thomas Dale, having remained five years in Amer ica, now departed for his native country, and left George Yeardley, as Deputy-Governor, in charge of the administra tion. He indulged the people in the cultivation of tobacco in preference to corn, which he compelled the natives to fur nish by wray of tribute. An instance of Yeardley's method of \"raising\" corn is as follows: Having sent to the Chickahominies for the tribute corn, and receiving an insolent answer, Governor Yeardley pro ceeded with one hundred men to their principal settlement, where he was met with contempt and scorn. Perceiving the Indians to be in a hostile and menacing posture, he ordered his men to fire on them, and twelve were killed on the spot. Twelve also were taken prisoners, two of whom were elders ; but they paid o?ie hundred bushels of corn for their ransom, and, as the price of peace , loaded three English boats with the coveted cereal ! Yeardley's government was successful, but he was, through Sir Thomas Smith's influence, superseded by Captain Samuel Argall, who arrived in Virginia, May, 1617, and assumed control of affairs. It is worthy of notice that in this year, 1616, died Richard Hakluyt, historian and geographer, a man whose enthusiasm and courage stimulated the American enterprise and influ enced the early settlement of Virginia in a pre-eminent degree."], [88, "56 XVI. CAPTAIN SAMUEL ARGALL. Deputy, or Lieutenant-Governor. May, 1617, to April, 1619. Samuel Argall came to Virginia as early as 1609, to trade and to fish for sturgeon. This traffic was in violation of the laws, but as the wine and provisions which he brought were much in demand, his conduct was connived at, and he continued to make voyages for his own advantage and in the service of the Colony. In 1613 he arrived at the island of Mount Desert, off the coast of Maine, for the purpose of fish ing, aud finding a settlement of French, which was made two years before, he attacked it and took most of the settlers pris oners. A Jesuit priest was killed in the engagement. This was the commencement of hostilities between the French and English colonists in America. Captain Argall soon after wards sailed from Virginia to Acadie, and destroyed the French settlements of St. Croix and Port Royal. In 1 6 14 he went to England, and returned in 161 7, clothed with the authority of Lieutenant-Governor of the Colony of Virginia. Being now beyond the reach of immediate control, he incurred the displeasure of the people and the proprietors by his tyrannical course. He was arrogant and greedy of gain, and by his arbitrary rule he \"imported more hazard to the plantation than ever did any other thing that befel that action from the beginning.\" Before an account of Argall's despotic sway had reached London, the authorities there had despatched Lord De la Warr, the Governor- General, to Vir ginia with two hundred men and supplies for the Colony. Orders followed to send Argall to England, where he was \"to answer everything that should be laid to his charge.\""], [89, "CAPTAIN SAMUEL ARGALL. 57 But the good Lord De la Warr was doomed not to reach Vir ginia. He died on this voyage, and Argall was left to oppress the colonists and defraud the Company to his heart's content. The condition of Virginia became insupportable, for life itself was insecure against the passionate whims of this unscrupu lous tyrant. The Colony languished, and no emigrants could be found for this unhappy settlement ; but the news which checked the spirit of adventure also roused the indignation of some of the London Company. Argall was displaced, and the mild and popular Yeardley elected Governor in his stead, with higher rank. During Argall's term of office, martial law, which had been proclaimed and executed during the turbulence of former times, was, in a season of peace, made the common law of the land. By this law a gentleman was tried for contemptuous words that he had spoken of the Governor, was found guilty, and condemned ; but his sentence was respited, and he appealed to the Treasurer and Council, who reversed the judgment of the court-martial. This is the first instance of an appeal carried from an American colony to England. Argall's first exploit in Virginia had been the abduction of Pocahontas, in 1612, from the care of a chief who had been intrusted by Powhatan with the charge of his daughter, but who surrendered her for the bribe of a brass kettle. Taking her to Jamestown, Argall gave her into the keeping of the Governor and the church. When he left the Colony he con tinued to lead an adventurous life. On September 6, 1625, he sailed from Plymouth as Admiral of twenty-four English and four Dutch ships, and during the cruise took seven ves sels, valued at ,\u00a3100,000; he is also said to have commanded the flag-ship during the attack on Cadiz. Beyond this, little is known of him, save that he was married and left children ; was knighted by James I. in 1623, and died in 1639.

But considering he had bene at so great chardge and paines to augmente this Colony, and had adventured his own person in the action, and since that time had brought home a good1'-' quantity of fifhe, to relieve the Colony by way of trade, and above all, because the Comission for authorising the General Assenrbly adnritteth of two Burgesses out of every plantation w\"'out restrainte or exception.

After all the Burgesses had taken the oath of Supremacy and were admitted into the house, and all sett downe in their places, a Copie of Captain24 Martin's Patent-5 was produced by the Govern'36 out ofa Clause whereof it appeared that when the general-1 assembly had made some kinde of lawes requisite for the whole Colony, he and his Burgesses and people might deride the whole company and chuse whether they would obay2s the same or no.* It was therefore ordered in Courte that the fore faid two Burgesses should w\"'drawe themselves out of the assembly till suche time as Captaine Martin had nrade his personall appearance before them.

This day Captaine Henry Spelman408 was convented before the Gen eral Assembly and was examined by a relation upon oath of one Robert Poole, Interpreter, what conference had passed between the said Spelman409 and Opochancano at Poole's meeting with him in Opochancano's courte.

A natural desire had long existed to know something of the proceedings of the first legislative Assembly ever held in Virginia, an event which inaugurated a new era in the his tory of the hitherto disturbed and oppressed Colony. The historian, Stith, could find no trace of this paper; Jefferson searched for it in vain, and the patient, painstaking Hening believed it no longer extant. What a prize then, is this \"Reporte,\" in its full and cir cumstantial details of the baptism of representative govern ment in the New World. Here, it will be seen that this first legislative Assembly in the wilds of America was opened with prayer, and that in its deliberations the Chinch of England was confirmed as the Church of Virginia. When Christopher Columbus ceased from the recital of his successful voyage of discovery before the Court of Spain, it is said that Ferdinand and Isabella, \" together with all present, prostrated themselves on their knees in grateful thanksgiving, while the solemn strains of the Te Deum were poured forth by the choir of the royal chapel, as in commemoration of some glorious victory.\" And yet, this first Assembly in the land rescued from darkness by the liberality of Spain, was opened by a prayer which rose to Heaven, not in the liquid language of old Castile, but in the English tongue ! In the far past, the Creed held sway that the Pope of Rome, as vicar of Jesus Christ, had power to dispose of all countries inhabited by heathen nations, in favor of Christian potentates; and yet, the three papal bulls of Alexander VI., \"out of his pure liberality, infallible knowledge, and pleni tude of apostolic power,\" investing Spain with plenary authority over all countries discovered by it, and confirming its absolute possession of the same, all previous concessions to the contrary notwithstanding ; yet, with all the weight of actual discovery, and the decrees of the pontifical throne in support of Spain, not the triple crown of Rome, but \"The Church of England,\" first raised its spire in these primeval forests. Here it laid broad and deep the foundations of that Holy Religion which has been the bulwark of Virginia's"], [117, "S/R GEORGE YEARDLEY. 85 liberties, the strength of her manhood, the glory of her womanhood ; the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, which for nearly three centuries has preserved the true and higher life of this noble old commonwealth ! The London Company approved the Colonial Assembly which had been convened by Sir George Yeardley, and on the 24th of July, 162 1, a memorable ordinance, established for the colony a written constitution. Its terms were few and simple, but the system of representative government and trial by jury became an acknowledged right in the New World. On this celebrated ordinance Virginia erected the superstruct ure of her independence. \"It constituted the plantation, in its infancy, a nursery of freemen,\" and its influences \u2014 some times written in letters of living light, sometimes written in blood \u2014 may be traced through all her history.* As an evidence of the increasing prosperity of the colony, it may be stated that in 1619, 20,000 pounds of tobacco were exported to England from Virginia; in April, 1620, a special commission was issued by King James for the inspection of this weed, and in June following, a proclamation for restrain ing the disorderly trading in the obnoxious article. Thus its uses and abuses began at an early period of colonial enter prise. This year of 1620 is also memorable for the introduction of negro slaves into Virginia. A Dutch man-of-war landed twenty negroes for sale, and these were the first brought into the country \u2014 ' ' The direful spring Of woes unnumbered \" to the far-off descendants of the colonists. *See Hening's \" Statutes at Large,\" Laws of Virginia, Vol. I., pp. rro-118."], [118, "86 XIX. SIR FRANCIS WYATT. Governor and Captain-General. November 8, 1621,-to May 17, 1626. Sir Francis Wyatt came to Virginia in October, 1621, at the request of Governor Yeardley, whose term of office was soon to expire. He succeeded Yeardley, November 8, 162 1, and was in his turn succeeded by Sir George Yeardley, May 17, 1626. Wyatt brought with him the new Constitution for the Colony, and the opening clause of his instructions reads as follows : ' ' To keep up religion of the Church of England as near as may be ; to be obedient to the King and do justice after the form of the laws of England ; and not to injure the na tives; and to forget old quarrels now buried.\" During Wyatt's administration the Indian massacre of March 22, 1622, occurred, in which 347 of the colonists were killed, and \" the 22d of March \" was ordered by the General Assembly held March 5, 1623, to \"be yearly solemnized as holliday,\" in commemoration of the escape of the Colony from entire extirpation at this time. The calamities which had befallen the Virginia Colony, and the dissensions which had agitated the Company having been represented to the King, he, after some measures of inquiry, had the matter brought to trial in the Court of King's Bench, where judg ment was given against the Virginia Company, and the charter vacated in 1624. King James now issued a new commission for the government of Virginia, continuing Sir Francis Wyatt in his office, with 11 Counsellors, and empow ering them to govern ' ' as fully and amplye as any Governor and Council resident there, at any time within the space of five years now last past.\" This term of five years was pre."], [119, "S/R FRANC/S WYATT. 87 cisely the established period of representative government, and so the continuance of popular assemblies was formally sanc tioned. But King James was denied the task of giving to the Colony a code of fundamental laws, for he died March 27, 1625, and was succeeded by Charles I. The demise of the Crown having annulled all former appointments for Virginia, Charles I. now reduced that Col ony under the immediate direction of the throne, appointing a Governor and Council, and ordering all patents and processes to issue in his own name. His proclamation \"for settling the plantation of Virginia,\" is dated May 13, 1625. When, however, early in 1626, Wyatt retired, the re-appointment of Sir George Yeardley by Charles I. was a guarantee in itself that, as \" the former interests of Virginia were to be kept in violate,\" so the representative government would be con tinued, for it was Yeardley who had introduced the system. King Charles, intent only on increasing his revenue, favored the wishes of the colonists, and in his commission to Yeard ley expressed his desire to encourage and perfect the planta tion ' ' by the same means that were formerly thought fit for the maintenance of the Colony.\" He also limited the power of the Governor and Council, as had before been done in the commission of Wyatt, by a reference to the usages of the last five years. In that period representative liberty had become the custom of Virginia. A new heaven and a new earth had spread before the Virginia colonist, and time nor change has ever blotted from his race that love of freedom which he first tasted then."], [120, "88 XX. SIR GEORGE YEARDLEY. Governor and Captain-General. May 17, 1626, to November 14, 1627. When, early in 1626, Wyatt retired from office (returning to Ireland on account of the death of his father), Charles I. appointed Sir George Yeardley his successor. Virginia rose, now, rapidly in public esteem. In 1627 one thousand emi grants arrived, and there was an increasing demand for the rich products of this virgin soil. During Yeardley 's three administrations many and great events in the life of the Col ony had taken place. Posterity retains a grateful recollection of the man who called together the first representative assem bly in the New World. His career was closed by death, in November, 1627, and the colonists, in a letter to the Privy Council, pronounced a eulogy on his virtues. The day after his burial, and in the absence of John Harvey, who was named in Yeardley's commission as his eventual successor, Francis West was elected Governor, for the Council was authorized to elect the Governor \" from time to time, as often as the case should require.\""], [121, "XXI.

He was authorized to restrain vessels from fishing or trading on the coast without a license from the New England Council, but, meeting with difficulty in executing this part of his commission, he sailed for Virginia. When Governor Yeardley died, the administration de volved on West. During his control of affairs the Colony received large accessions of emigrants from Europe. Captain West returned to England, March 5, 1629, when Dr. John Pott succeeded him in presiding over the fortunes of the Col ony.

During this period the Assembly was twice convened, and many regulations adopted for the defense of the Colony.

John Harvey was commissioned Governor of the Colony, March 26, 1628, and was knighted soon after by Charles I. He met his first Assembly of Burgesses, March 24, 1630. Harvey was one of the most rapacious, tyrannical, and un popular of the royal Governors ; was suspended by an indig nant Assembly in 1635, and impeached, but was restored by the King the next year, and continued in office until 1639. But, during the period of his office, despite his partial judgments and cruel exercise of power, the accustomed legislative rights of the Colony were unimpaired. On June 20, 1632, Charles I. granted to Lord Baltimore a patent for a portion of Virginia, which he named \" Mary land \" in honor of his Queen. This grant gave great umbrage to the planters of Virginia, and offers the first example in colonial history of the dismemberment of an ancient colony by the formation of a new province, with sep arate and equal rights. Virginia regarded the severing of her territory with apprehension. She remonstrated against the grant \"as an invasion of her commercial rights, an infringement on her domains, and a discouragement to her planters \"; but she remonstrated in vain. John Harvey courted the favor of Lord Baltimore and sympathized with Maryland in the dispute over Kent Island and trade in the Chesapeake, and he was odious to the colonists, whose territorial interests he betrayed. The}' rose in indignation at his abuse of power, and on the 28th of April, 1*635, arrested him \"for treason \" and drove him out of the country. But the territory of Maryland they could not reclaim ; it had been taken from Virginia forever."], [124, "92 XXIV CAPTAIN JOHN WEST. President of the Council.

Harmony prevailed, and the memory of ancient griefs was lost in the growing spirit of independence which thrilled through every vein of the new and growing Body Politic. Virginia now enjoyed all the liberties which a monarch could concede and retain his supremacy. The Indians, however, goaded on by grievous wrongs and a determination on the part of the settlers to make no terms of peace with them, resolved upon a general massacre of the pale-faced foe. This they attempted on April 18, 1644, but after slaying three hundred they abandoned their savage work and fled to the woods. So little was apprehended from them after this, that two months later Governor Berkeley embarked for England and left Richard Kempe as his substitute. Sir William Berkeley was born near London in 1610. He was educated at Oxford, and by extensive travel and acquaint ance with the world, was well fitted for the position of influ ence to which he was appointed in the Colony.

Richard Kempe comes before us first as a member of the Council of Virginia, in 1642, and in 1644 as Acting Gov ernor during Sir William Berkeley's absence in England. Bishop Meade, in his \"Old Churches, Ministers, and Fam ilies of Virginia,\" says: \" There is one name on the foregoing list* to which I must allude as having, at an early period in the history of Virginia, been characterized by a devotion to the welfare of the Church and religion \u2014 that of Kempe. The name often occurs on the vestry-book of Middlesex County in such a way as to show this. The high esteem in which one of the family was held, is seen from the fact that he was the Governor of the Colony in 1644, and the following extract from the first volume of Hening's Statutes will show- not only the religious character of those in authority at that day, but the probability that Governor Kempe sympathized in the movement, for the Governors had great power either to promote or prevent such a meas ure. In 1644 it was \u2014 'Enacted by the Governor, Council, and Burgesses of this Grand Assembly, for God's glory and the public benefit of the Colony, to the end that God might avert his heavy judgments that are upon us, that the last Wednesday in every month be set apart for fast and humiliation, and that it be wholly dedicated to prayers and preaching, &c.

June, 1645, to April 30, 1652. While the Colony of Virginia was acquiring the manage ment of its own concerns, slowly but surely England was being distracted by a civil war. This war resulted in the dethrone ment and capture of the King, who was afterwards beheaded in front of his palace at Whitehall, January 30, 1649. Justice was no longer to be administered in the King's name, and the title of the realm was exchanged for that of ' ' The Common wealth of England.\" Oliver Cromwell was declared Captain- General of the troops of the state, and afterwards rose to the supreme power, with the title of Protector. During this civil war, Governor Berkeley took the royal side, and Virginia was the last of the English possessions which acknowledged the authority of Cromwell. Two years after Charles I. was beheaded, Parliament sent a fleet to Virginia to compel its submission. Sir William Berkeley was obliged then to sur render to superior power. Cromwell ruled England for eleven years, during which time peace and prosperity reigned in all the countries under his control. Although Virginia had been forced to submit to his authority, she never gave up her loyalty to the throne of England. She sent a vessel to Flanders, to the son of Charles I., who was in exile there, offering him her support, and invit ing him to come to Virginia and set up his throne upon her territory. Charles accepted, and was actually preparing to embark when his subjects in England recalled him to the throne of his fathers. Once established in power, Charles II., in gratitude to Virginia for her loyalty, caused her to be pro claimed an independent member of his empire, which was to"], [131, "S/R WILL/ AM BERKELEY. 99 consist of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Virginia, and her coat-of-arms was added to those of the other three countries comprised in his realm.

RICHARD BENNET Acting Governor Under the Commonwealth of Cromwell. April 30, 1652, to March, 1655. Richard Bennet first took part in colonial affairs as Burgess, in October, 1629, from \" Warrosquoyeake,\" which formed one of the eight original shires, in the year 1634. This shire embraced a distance of ninety miles, but its name was soon changed to Isle of Wight, and in 1642 it was divided into two parishes, the upper and lower, or Newport and Warwicks queake, each extending the full length of the count}', or ninety miles. Under Berkeley's administration, Richard Bennet had been oppressed in Virginia, and he fled to Maryland to escape persecution. From thence he went to London, where, on September 26, 165 1, he was chosen as one of the commis sioners appointed by the Commonwealth of England to reduce the royal Colony of Virginia to submission. The commis sioners were constituted pacificators and benefactors of the country. In case of resistance, war was threatened ; if Vir ginia would adhere to the Commonwealth, she might be the mistress of her own destiny.

When Bennet retired from office, the Assembly elected his successor, and Edward Digges, who had before been chosen of the Council, and who \"had given a signal testimony of his fidelity to Virginia and to the Commonwealth of Eng land,\" received the suffrages. In 1666 Bennet commanded the militia of three of the four military districts into which Virginia was divided, with the rank of Major-General, and was a member of the Council as late as 1674. He owned the plantations of \"Weyanoak\" and \"Kicotan,\" on the James River, and has many dis tinguished descendants in Virginia."], [137, "XXXI. EDWARD DIGGES.

This particular mark of favor from the King was in acknowledgment of the firmness which the Virginians had expressed in the royal cause.

It was theirs through famine, pestilence, and the sword \u2014 wrested from the grasp of no common foe, and bought by the blood of no common sacrifice.

During the Commonwealth of England there were four Governors appointed under the provisional government of Virginia, viz.: Richard Bennet, April, 1652 ; Edward Digges, March, 1655 ; Samuel Matthews, March, 1657-8. Samuel Matthews was elected March, 1657-8, and at the same session, a contest arising between the Governor and Council and the House of Burgesses, as to the constitutional power of dissolving the Assembly, the Burgesses declared all former elections of Governor and Council void and null, but, immediately after, re-elected Matthews. By the first act of March, 1658-9 Matthews was again elected, and by the second act of March, 1659-60, Sir William Berkeley was re-elected by the Assembly in Virginia, and was commissioned to act by Charles II., July 31, 1660.

Deputy or Lieutenant-Governor. March 23, 1661, to December 23, 1662. Colonel Moryson had arrived in the Colony in the au tumn of 1649. He was a loyalist and as such received a warm welcome from Sir William Berkeley, who, it is said, gave Moryson the command of the fort at Point Comfort. He became a member of the Council, was Speaker of the House of Burgesses in 1656, and was finally selected Deputy- Governor during Sir William Berkeley's absence in England. During Colonel Moryson 's term of office, at a Grand As sembly held at James City, March 23, 1661-62, the whole body of the laws of the Colony was reviewed and a copy sent to England to Sir William Berkeley, \"to procure his Majesty's royal confirmation.\" These Acts, numbering 142, began with the following : Act I. \" Bee itt enacted, for the advancement of Gods glory, and the more decent celebration of his divine ordinances, that there be a church decently built in each parish of this country, unles any parish as now setled by reason of the fewnes or poverty of the inhabitants be incapable of sus teyning soe greate a charge, in which case it is enacted that such parishes shall be joyned to the next greate parish, of the same county, and that a chappell of ease be built, in such places, at the particular charge of that place.\" Thus it will be seen that all through the history of the early settlement of this country a reverence for the Church is constantly recognized, and though this \"outward and vis ible sign ' ' may not always have evidenced ' ' an inward and spiritual grace,\" still it is edifying to observe that God was"], [148, "THE GOVERNORS OF V/RG/N/A. 116 acknowledged first in all the temporal affairs of the first Vir ginians.

The Honorable Sir William Berkeley Knt. Govenor.* By the foregoing it will be seen that Governor Berkeley now entered upon his fourth term of office in Virginia. He had fostered the Colony in its infancy, and during his rule, though it had seen many changes, it had steadily advanced in the path of prosperity. But clouds were rising to burst in fury on the venerable Governor's path. The low price of tobacco, and the ill-treatment of the planters in the exchange of goods for it; the splitting of the Colony into proprietaries, contrary to the original charters, the heavy restraints and burdens laid upon their trade by Act of Parliament, and last, though not least, the troubles with the unsleeping Indian foe ; all these wrongs stirred the souls of many Virginia Fathers, who were soon to show their discontent in that historic period known as \"Bacon's Rebellion.\" This suf fering time, which cost much blood and treasure, which broke up the local government for a time, and laid the first-born city * Hening's Statutes at Large, Vol. II., p. 163. 11,"], [150, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 118 of the Western Wild in ashes, was in the end a blessing to the people. Nathaniel Bacon perished, but not before he had, by valor unsurpassed, defied tyrannic power and destroyed forever, the Indian Empire in Virginia. \"Bacon's Quarter Branch\" and \"Bloody Run\" have their own imperishable story. But around the death of Nathaniel Bacon mystery has always hung. No circumstantial details of the event have been preserved, and though historians have ascribed his untimely \"taking off\" to cold and great fatigue from arduous duties, still there has ever lurked suspicion that he fell by the hand of an assassin employed by the government. When we con sider the instructions of the King to Governor Berkeley, that Bacon was to be taken at all hazards, that both force and design were to be employed, it gives a terrible significance to the following words, Act I., General Assemblie, June 8, 1680 : \"until it pleased the Almighty to send him, the said Bacon, an infamous and exemplary death.\" * There were two persons living at this time who bore the name of Nathaniel Bacon. The elder was a friend and fol lower of Governor Berkeley ; the younger was the heroic spirit who headed the Rebellion. These two men were cousins, but this did not prevent the elder Bacon from persecuting to \"the bitter end\" the men whom he termed \"rebels.\" Yet more bloody than Bloody Run was Berkeley's ven geance upon the men who had driven him from his citadel a refugee and had refused obedience to his arbitrary laws. His thirst for blood increased with what it fed on, and in the language of an ancient Burgess, \"He would have hanged half the country if he had been let alone.\" The King himself, horrified at the cruelty of Berkeley, exclaimed, \"That old fool has hanged more men in that naked country than I have done here for the murder of my father.\" So closed in deep dishonor a career which opened with such fair promises of usefulness and virtuous example. Berkeley had been loved and venerated for many years, but he was not \"Hening's Statutes at Large, Vol. II., p. 460."], [151, "S/R WILLIAM BERKELEY. 119 born for trial, and when the supreme hour broke upon him he greatly fell !

Let us devoutly hope, that standing before the Great and Last Tribunal, he met with Divine compassion, even though when ' ' clothed wTith a little, brief authority \" upon earth he had been unmindful of the sweet promise to the merciful, and had forgotten that gentlest Virtue, which ' ' becomes The throned monarch better than his crown.\""], [152, "XXXVI. SIR HERBERT JEFFRIES. Lieutenant-Governor. April 27, 1677, to December 30, 1678. Sir Herbert Jeffries was appointed Lieutenant-Gover nor of Virginia, and one of the commissioners for inquiring into the state of the Colony, in 1676. He assumed the adminis tration on the return of Sir William Berkeley to England, and exerted himself wisely and well to restore peace to a dis tracted country. He made a treaty with the Indians of the West, by which each town agreed to pay three arrows for their land and twent)' beaver skins annually for protection. But Jeffries did not live to see the accomplishment of his ju dicious plans. He died in 1678, when the government de volved upon Sir Henry Chicheley. It is a matter of interest to note that the last Assembly held by Governor Berkeley \" Begunne at Green Spring,\" and that the Grand Assembly, held by Governor Jeffries, Oct. 10, 1677, \"Begunne at Middle Plantation, Att the house of Capt. Otho Thorpe.\" Green Spring was Governor Berkeley's residence, which he had built himself only a few miles from James City, and Middle Plantation was afterwards called Williamsburg. This change of venue was of course the result of the burning of James City. 130"], [153, "XXXVII. SIR HENRY CHICHELEY Deputy- Governor. December 30, 1678, to May 10, 1680. In the year 1666 the vestry of Lancaster Parish, Virginia, agreed to build a church about midway the parish, to be called Christ Church, the glass and iron to be gotten from England. Here Sir Henry Chicheley served as vestryman, and here his mortal part was buried. Says Bishop Meade, in 1872 : \"And what has become of the old Mother Church \u2014 the Great Church, as she is styled in her journal \u2014 standing in view of the wide Rappahan nock, midway between Rosegill and Brandon? More perhaps than fifty years ago it was deserted. Its roof decayed and fell in. Everything within it returned to its native dust. But nature abhors a vacuum. A sycamore tree sprang up within its walls. All know the rapidity of that tree's growth. It filled the void. Its boughs soon rose above and over spread the walls. In the year 1840, when it pleased God to put it into the hearts of some, in whom the spirit of old Virginia Episcopalians still remained, to seek the revival of the Church's dry bones in Middlesex, that huge, overspreading tree must first be removed piece-nreal from the house, and the rich mould of fifty years' accumulation, to the depth of two feet, urust be dug up before the chancel floor and the stone aisles could be reached. The walls \u2014 faithful workmanship of other days \u2014 were unin jured, and may still remain while generations of frail modern structures pass away. The house is now one of our best country churches. The graves of our ancestors are all around it. In scattered fragments some of the tombstones lie ; others, too substantial to be broken, too heavy to be borne away, now plainly tell whose remains are protected by them.\" In 1656 Sir Henry Chicheley was a Burgess from Lan caster County, and in 1674 he was a member of the Council. In March, 1676, he was made commander of the forces to be sent against the Indians, but Sir William Berkeley disbanded them before they entered upon duty.

Sir Henry Chicheley took very energetic measures for the protection of the colonists against the encroachments of the Indians, causing that ' ' sower houses for stores or garrisons be erected and built at the heads of the flower greate rivers,\" namely, the Potomac, Rappahannock, Mattapony, and James. By these and other measures for the public weal, Sir Henry greatl}' ingratiated himself in public favor.

Governor and Captain-GeneraL May 10, 1680, to September 17, 1683. All accounts agree in describing the situation of Virginia during Lord Culpeper's administration as one of extreme suffering. Charles II. had in 1673, with lavish prodigality, given to two of his favorite courtiers, Lord Culpeper and the Earl of Arlington, \"all the dominion of land and water called Virginia, for the term of thirty-one years.\" This grant gave rise to the 1st Act of September, 1674, for an address to the King on the subject. Three agents were appointed, and the zeal and ability with which they prosecuted their mission de served a better result. The King consented to a new charter confirming all the essential stipulations insisted on, and twice ordered the instrument to be prepared, but, after empty promises, he eventually gave a \"miserable skeleton\" con taining little more than a declaration of the dependence of the Colony on the Crown of England. Thus did Charles II. sow the seeds of discontent which finally resulted in the separation of the Colonies from the mother country. This grant to Culpeper was unjust and op pressive, as it included lands which had been long cultivated by others; and, about two years after the patent was issued, he, the better to \"put in his thumb, and take out a plum,\" obtained the appointment of Governor of Virginia for life. As such, he was proclaimed soon after Berkeley's departure. But he remained in England, and not until reproved by the King did he set sail for Virginia ; here he arrived early in 1680. Having taken the oath of office at Jamestown, he commenced a course of personal aggrandizement ; the Gov-"], [156, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 124 ernor's salary was doubled; a further grant was made for house rent ; perquisites of every kind were sought for and in creased ; nay, the soldiers of the Colony were defrauded of a part of their pay by an arbitrary change in the value of cur rent coin. He procured an Act of Assembly which \"author ized a perpetual export duty of two shillings a hogshead on tobacco, and granted the proceeds for the support of govern ment, to be accounted for, not to the Assembly, but to the King.\" Besides all this, Lord Culpeper had received an im mense grant of land from the King in what is known as the Northern Neck of Virginia, which embraced the territory lying between the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers back as far as the Blue Ridge Mountains. Having employed his time profit ably for himself, and balefully for Virginia, from May until August, he then returned to England to enjoy the fruits of his labors, and left Sir Henry Chicheley as Deputy-Governor of the Colony. After Culpeper's departure, discontent grew widespread among the planters at a law that had been passed, compelling them to load their tobacco at certain specified places along the river banks. For many years Jamestown was the only town in the Colony, and after it was burned there was a great necessity for some fixed places of trade. In order, to secure the building of towns this Act was passed. But the planters, accustomed now to load the vessels at their own plantations, resisted the measure, and in Gloucester County some of them actually destroyed their entire crop, rather than be pressed to dispose of it in a way that was contrary to their wishes. Others followed their example and open rebellion to the law was threatened. The King com pelled Lord Culpeper to return to Virginia, and he, vexed at leaving the pleasures of London, determined to make short work of the difficulty. He soon filled the jails with prisoners, hung six men for this trifling offence, proclaimed the pen alty of death against all \"plant cutters,\" and, by this cruel course, ended the Tobacco Rebellion. Culpeper returned to England, September 17, 1683, and left Nicholas Spencer as the executive of the Colony. For this second breach of faith in quitting his government,"], [157, "THOMAS, LORD CULPEPER. 125 in violation of orders, he was arrested immediately on his ar rival in England. His patent was for life, but it was rendered void by a process of law, not so much from regard to colonial liberties as to recover a prerogative for the Crown. On July 25, 1684, Virginia became again a royal province. As an evidence of Lord Culpeper's hostility to the intro duction of printing into the Colony, the following extract is made from a MS. of unquestionable authority : \"Feb. 21st, 1682. John Buckner called before the Lord Culpeper and his council for printing the laws of 1680, without hisExcellencie's licence, aud he and the printer ordered to enter into bond in not to print anything thereafter until his Majestie's pleasure should be known.\"* This step rivals Sir William Berkeley's views, who thought that the more profoundly ignorant the colonists were kept, the better subjects they were for slavery.

September 17, 1683, to April 16, 1684 Upon the departure of Lord Culpeper for England, he appointed Nicholas Spencer, President of the Council.

He continued in office until the 1 6th of April, 1684, on which day a commission to Francis, Lord Howard, dated 28th September, 35 Car. 11 ( 1683), was read. Nicholas Spencer was said to have been a kinsman of Lord Culpeper. In June, 1666, he was a member of the House of Burgesses, and in October, 1686, he was Secretary of the Colony, which in 1681 contained about 14,000 \" tithables, or working hands,\" and the House of Burgesses consisted of forty-one members. At this time it was said in relation to the Indians and Tobacco : ' ' We are at peace with all ; at least, in war with none. But that which bids fair to be the speedy and certain undoing of this Colony, is the low or rather no price of the only product of our lands, and our only commodity, tobacco ; for the market is overstocked and every crop overstocks it more.

Trouble with the Indians again assailing the tranquility of the Colony, Lord Effingham went to Albany, and there, with the Gov ernor of New York, met the chiefs of the Five Nations and effected with them a Treaty of Peace. These Five Nations, the Oneidas, Onondagos, Cayugas, Mohawks, and Senecas, had absorbed all the other Indians in the country, and formed a very powerful combination. During Effingham's absence in New York, Nathaniel Bacon, Senior, President of the Council, assumed his duties.

Lord Effingham being removed from the government of Virginia, Sir Edmund Andros, of obnoxious memory in New England, was appointed Governor in his stead. Andros is generally accepted as having been not a bad Governor for Virginia, but in consideration of his previous lawless career in New England, his advancement occasioned the amazement of the public. He was born in London, December 6, 1637, and arrived in the Colony of Virginia, October 16, 1693. He had been, at an earlier period, appointed Governor of New York, in 1674, and continued in that office until 1682. In December, 1686, he arrived at Boston with a commission from King James for the government of New England. Here his administration was most tyrannical and oppressive. The press was restrained, and exorbitant taxes levied. It was pretended that all titles to land were destroyed, and the farm ers were obliged to take new patents, for which they paid large fees. He prohibited marriage unless celebrated by Ministers of the Church of England, and at that time there was said to be but one Episcopal clergyman in the country ; and by this and various other acts of lawless usurpation, he inflamed the spirits of the people whom he governed. Ani mated with the love of liberty which they had bought in the wilds of America, on the morning of April 18, 1689, the inhab itants of Boston took up arms. The people poured in from the country, and the Governor, with about fifty of his obnoxious followers, was seized and confined.

After having been kept at the castle a prisoner until the February following, Sir Edmund was sent to England for trial. The government failed to censure him, and in 1692 he was appointed Governor of Virginia. Before he assumed this office, Sir Edmund had seen a good deal of military and civil service in England and in New England, and had, so to speak, \"sowed his wild oats ' ' when he took charge of the government of the Ancient Dominion. During his administration, William and Mary College was established, an Act was passed by the General Assembly ascertaining the place for its erection, and also an Act laying an imposition upon ' ' skins and furs ' ' for its better support. Governor Andros had a great love of order, and to his care the historical inquirer is indebted for the preservation of the early papers of Virginia. He went into the public reposi tories of official documents, and finding them in confusion \u2014 torn, soiled, and neglected \u2014 he ordered steps to be taken for their re-arrangement and better preservation. He encouraged manufactures, suggested the cultivation of cotton, and stimu lated the life of the Colony by his own eager and industrious spirit. Unhappily, he fell into strife with James Blair, Presi dent of William and Mary College, which resulted in the removal of Andros from office. During the term of Andros, an Act was passed appointing Rangers at the heads of the four great rivers in Virginia. These were to consist of one lieutenant, eleven soldiers, and two Indians, to be well furnished with horses and arms, to be called Rangers, and to be constantly on duty. Also, in 1695, the General Assembly of Virginia passed ' ' An Act impower ing the Governor, with the advice of the Councell, to apply five hundred pounds sterling, out of the imposition of liquors, raised by this Assembly, to the assistance and preservation of New York, if found necessary.\" This step was taken at a time when the peace of New York was threatened by internal dissensions between the Governor and his Assembly, and is an interesting piece of history to recall in the close of the nineteenth century."], [166, "134 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA.

During Governor Nott's administration an Act was passed \"directing the building an house for the Governor of this Colony and dominion,\" appropriating land for that purpose, stating dimensions and materials for house, and authorizing the Governor to draw on the Treasurer for the sum of An Act also was passed at this time, continuing the Act di recting the building of the Capitol and City of Williamsburg at Middle Plantation. The specifications of this Act are very interesting, when in the light of later days we review the plans laid for the Capitol of Virginia. Special provision was also made now for the French refugees, whose settlement was above the Falls of James River, and their parish was known as \" King William Parish in the County of Henrico.\" Virginia in 1703 contained 60,606 souls, not including the French refugees, and it numbered 25 counties.

The Colony at this period enjoyed tranquility and increasing prosperity. The safeguard of the liberties of Vir ginia lay in the individual freedom of mind which was the fruit of independent and somewhat isolated living. In seclusion men thought for themselves, and \"pernicious notions, fatal to the royal prerogative, were improving daily.\" From the time of Bacon's Rebellion, Virginia had known only the undisturbed blessings of peace, and with steady advance she was becoming stronger and stronger in her own individ uality.

ALEXANDER SPOTSWOOD Lieutenant-Governor. June 23, 1710, to September 27, 1722. We now approach a very interesting period in the history of the Virginia Colony. Up to this time, both Governors and people had been content with the territorial restrictions which hostile Indians on the border, and multiplied difficul ties at home had enforced. They knew nothing of the coun try which lay hidden by that billowy range of mountains which ever on the sunset sky would trace suggestions of a great Beyond. It had been a capital maxim of the French in their American policy, to conceal all knowledge of the coun try between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River, so that the English knew only such uncertain accounts as had been given by straggling travelers and by Indians. Yet now, the hour had struck when these mountains were no longer to be a barrier to advancing civilization, but rather, \"a stepping-stone to higher things.\" On June 23, 1710, there arrived in the Colony a man whose coming marked a new era in its history. Colonel Alexander Spotswood had been appointed Lieutenant-Governor to George Hamilton, Earl of Orkney, the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Virginia. He was a man of uncommon enterprise and public spirit, a friend to learning and to religion. He came of a long line of distinguished ancestry and was a noble son of noble sires. His great-grandfather was John Spotswood, Archbishop of St. Andrew's and author of the \"History of the Church of Scotland\" ; his grandfather was Robert Spots wood, Lord President of the College of Justice, and author of the \" Practicks of the Laws of Scotland.\" Sir Walter Scott narrates that this Robert Spotswood (who was one of the"], [174, "142 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. eight eminent lawyers executed by the Parliament of Scot land, which consisted wholly of Covenanters), while at pri vate prayer on the scaffold, was interrupted by the Presbyte rian minister in attendance and asked if he did not desire his prayers and those of the people. Sir Robert replied, that he earnestly desired the prayers of the people, but not those of the preacher, for that, in his opinion, God had expressed his displeasure against Scotland by sending a lying spirit into the mouths of the prophets. Governor Spotswood's father was Dr. Robert Spotswood, physician to the Governor of Tangier, an English Colony in Africa. His mother was the widow, Catherine Elliott, when she married Dr. Spots wood. The portrait of Mrs. Catherine Elliott's son, Gen eral Elliott, now hangs in the State Library at Richmond, Virginia. Alexander Spotswood was the only son of Robert and Catherine Spotswood. He was born in Tangier in in 1676 ; was reared among soldiers and educated for a military life. He became aide to the Duke of Marlborough, and was badly wounded in the breast at the battle of Blenheim. Exchanging, however, now, the hardships and honors of military life in the Old World, for the high position of Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia, he turned the current of his energies to the promotion of her welfare. His soldierly experience and genius enabled him to wield the militia with great effect against the hostile Indians, and his interest in matters civil and religious is evidenced by many acts during his administration. A number of German Protestants having about this time settled above the Falls of the Rappahannock River, at a place afterwards named Germanna, to the great advantage of the Colony, and the security of the frontiers from the incursions of the Indians, the Assembly passed an Act to exempt them from levies for seven years, and for erecting Germanna into a distinct parish, by the name of \" St. George. ' ' Here Governor Spotswood established a furnace and built a \"Castle,\" in which he occasionally resided. He endeavored to develop the mineral resources of this section, and the Rev. Hugh Jones, one of the colonial clergy, says :"], [175, "ALEXANDER SPOTSWOOD. 143 \"Beyond Governor Spotswood's furnace, within view of the vast mountains, he has fouuded a town called Germanna, from some Germans sent over by Queen Ann, who are now removed up further. Here he has servants and workmen of most handicraft trades, and he is building a church, court house, and dwelling house for himself, and with his servants and negroes he has cleared plantations about it, proposing great encour agement for people to come and settle in that uninhabited part of the world, lately divided into a county.\" At this time pig and bar iron were first made in Virginia. The dangerous extent of the French claims upon the Continent had for a long time attracted the attention of the Colonies. To resist it, was one of the earliest efforts of Spotswood, who hoped to extend the line of the Virginia settlements far enough to the West to interrupt the chain of communication between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. In 1 716, Governor Spotswood, with some of the first gentle men in the Colony, led personally an expedition to search for a passage or gap through \"the great mountains.\" Campbell says : ' ' The whole company was about fifty persons. They had a large number of riding and pack-hoi,~es, an abundant supply of provisions, and an extraordinary variety of liquors.\" This gay party of adventurers started from Germanna, and after leisurely advancing through the country reached ' ' Swift Run Gap,\" which is supposed to be the now historic \"pass.\" Governor Spotswood is said to have cut his Majesty's name upon a rock on the highest mountain they ascended, naming it \"Mt. George,\" and the gentlemen of the party called the peak next to it, in honor of the Governor, \"Mt. Spotswood.\" What must have been the exultation and the triumph which thrilled the hearts and brains of those explorers as they beheld the goodly heritage which spread before them ! At their feet lay an unconquered realm, untrodden and unknown ! Here was a time, indeed, to pause and dream of glories \"yet to be.\" Thoughts such as Columbus had in his supreme moment of discovery must have shaken those sturdy forms and filled those wondering eyes with a prophetic meaning. Now, that those visions are realities, that those hopes have faded in fruition ; now, that the Atlantic and Pacific surges"], [176, "144 THE GOVERNORS OF V/RG/N/A. wash the shores of one country and one people, well may we \" Honor the charge they made,\" as this knightly company, breaking through Swift Run Gap, planted their daring standard on the Appalachian Range, and grasped in that momentous hour an imperial hope \u2014 \"The baby figure of the giant mass Of things to come. ' ' On this eventful Quest, these cavaliers were compelled to carry a large number of horseshoes, things seldom used in the eastern part of Virginia, where there were few stones. In commemoration of the journey, the Governor on his return presented each of his companions with a golden horseshoe, bearing the inscription, \" Sic juvat transcendere Montes.\" By this he intended to stimulate them to return to this wild region and open the country to future settlers. Any one entitled to wear this golden badge could prove that he be longed to \"The Tramontane Order,\" and had drunk his Majesty's health on wild Mt. George. King George, when he heard of the expedition, bestowed upon Governor Spots wood the honors of knighthood, and sent him a golden horse shoe set with jewels. All who took part in this memorable trip were recognized by the title of ' ' The Knight of the Golden Horseshoe.\" The following journal of one of the party on this expedition cannot fail to be of lasting interest. It was written by Mr. John Fontaine, who came to Virginia, in 1713, for the purpose of exploring the country and choosing lands for the settlement of his family. He was an Ensign in the British army, and shows by his journal that he had the indomitable spirit of the British soldier. He made the acquaintance of Governor Spotswood, who no doubt gladly enrolled him in his band of discoverers : Journal of Mr. Fontaine. August 27th. \u2014 Got our tents in order aud our horses shod. 29th. \u2014 In the morning we got all things in readiness, and about one we left the German-town, to set out on our intended jouruey. At five in the afternoon the Governor gave orders to encamp near a small river three miles from Germanna, which we call Expedition Run, and here we"], [177, "ALEXANDER SPOTSWOOD. 145 lay all night. The first encampment was called Beverly Camp, in honor of one of the gentlemen of our party. We made great fires, and supped, and drank good punch. By ten of the clock I had taken all of my ounce of Jesuit's bark, but my head was much out of order. 30th.\u2014 In the morning about seven of the clock the trumpet sounded to awake all the company, and we got up. One Austin Smith, one of the gentlemen with us, having a fever, returned home. We had lain upon the ground under cover of our tents, and we found by the pains in our bones that we had not had good beds to lie upon. At nine in the morn ing we sent our servants and baggage forward, and we remained, be cause two of the Governor's horses had strayed. At half-past two we got the horses, at three we mounted, and at half an hour after four we came up with our baggage at a small river three miles on -the way, which we call Mine River, because there was an appearance of a silver mine by it. We made about three miles more, and came to another small river, which is at the foot of a small mountain, so we encamped here and called it Mountain Run, and our camp we called Todd's Canrp. We had good pasturage for our horses, and venison in abundance for ourselves, which we roasted before the fire on wooden forks, and so we went to bed in our tents. We made six nriles this day. 31st. \u2014 At eight in the morning we set out from Mountain Run, and after going five miles we came upon the upper part Rappahannock River. One of the gentlemen and I, we kept out on one side of the company about a mile, to have the better hunting. I saw a deer and shot him from my horse, but the horse threw me a terrible fall and ran away ; we ran after him, and with a great deal of difficulty got him again ; but we could not find the deer I had shot, and we lost ourselves, and it was two hours before we could come upon the track of our company. About five miles farther we crossed the same river again, and two miles farther we met with a large bear, which one of our company shot, and I got the skin. We killed several deer, and about two miles from the place where we killed the bear we encamped, upon the Rappahannock River. From our encampment we could see the Appalachian Hills very plain. We made large fires, pitched our tents, and cut boughs to lie upon, had good liquor, and at ten we went to sleep. We always kept a sentry at the Governor's door. We called this Smith's Camp. Made this day fourteen miles. 1st September. \u2014 At eight we mounted our horses and made the first five miles of our way through a very pleasant plain, which lies where Rappahannock River forks. I saw there the largest timber, the finest and deepest mould, and the best grass that I ever did see. We had some of our baggage put out of order, and our company dismounted, by hornets stinging the horses. This was some hindrance and did a little damage, but afforded a great deal of diversion. We killed three bears this day, which exercised the horses as well as the men. We saw two foxes, but did not pursue them ; we killed several deer. About five of the clock we"], [178, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 146 came to a run of water at the foot of a hill where we pitched our tents. We called the encampment Dr. Robinson's Camp, and the River, Blind Run. We had good pasturage for our horses, and every one was cook for himself. We made our beds with bushes as before. This day we made thirteen miles. 2d. \u2014 At nine we were all on horseback, and after riding about five miles we crossed the Rappahannock River almost at the head, where it is very small. We had a rugged way ; we passed over a great many small runs of water, some of which were very deep and others very miry. Sev. eral of our company were dismounted, some were down with their horses, and some thrown off. We saw a bear running down a tree, but it being Sunday we did not endeavor to kill anything. We encamped at five, by a small river we called White Oak River, and called our canrp, Taylor's Camp. 3d. \u2014 About eight we were on horseback, and about ten we came to a thicket so tightly laced together that we had a great deal of trouble to get through. Our baggage was injured, our clothes torn all to rags, aud the saddles and holsters also torn. About five of the clock we encamped almost at the head of James River, just below the great mountains. We called this camp, Col. Robertson's Camp. We made all this day but eight ntiles. 4th. \u2014 We had two of our men sick with the measles and one of our horses poisoned with a rattlesnake. We took the heaviest of our baggage, our tired horses, aud the sick men, and made as convenient a lodge for thenr as we could, and left people to guard them, and to hunt for them. We had finished this work by twelve, and so we set out. The sides of the mountains were so full of vines and briers, that we were forced to clear most of the way before us. We crossed one of the small mountains on this side the Appalachian, and from the top of it we had a fine view of the plains below: We were obliged to walk up the most of the way, there being abundance of loose stones on the side of the hill. I killed a large rattlesnake here, and the other people killed three more. We made about four miles, and so came to the side of James River where a man may jump over it, and there we pitched our tents. As the people were light ing the fire, there came out of a large log of wood, a prodigious snake, which they killed, so this camp was called Rattlesnake Camp, but other wise, it was called Brooke's Camp. 5th. \u2014 A fair day. At five we were mounted. We were obliged to have axemen to clear the way in some places. We followed the windings of James River, observing that it came from the very top of the mount ains. We killed two rattlesnakes during our asecut. In some places it was very steep, in others it was so that we could ride up. About one of the clock we got to the top of the mountain ; about four miles and a half aud we came to the very head-spring of James River, where it runs no bigger than a man's arm from under a big stone. We drank King"], [179, "ALEXANDER SPOTSWOOD. 147 George's health and all the royal family's at the very top of the Appa lachian mountains. About a musket-shot from the spring there is another, which rises and runs down to the other side. It goes westward, and we thought we could go down that way, but we met with such pro digious precipices, that we were obliged to return to the top again. We found some trees which had been formerly marked, I suppose by the Northern Indians, and following these trees we found a good, safe descent. Several of the company were for returning, but the Governor persuaded them to continue on. About five, we were down on the other side, and continued our way until about seven miles further, when we came to a large river, by the side of which we encamped. We made this day four teen miles. I, being somewhat more curious than the rest, went on a high rock on the top of the mountain to see fine prospects, and I lost nry gun. We saw when we were over the mountain, the footing of elk and buffaloes and their beds. We saw a vine which bore a sort of wild cucum ber, and a shrub with a fruit like unto a currant. We ate very good wild grapes. We called this place Spotswood's Camp, after our Governor. 6th. \u2014 We crossed the river, which we called Euphrates. It is very deep ; the main course of the water is north ; it is fourscore yards wide in the narrowest part. We drank some health on the other side and returned, after which I went a-swinrming in it. We could not find any fordable place except the one by which we crossed, and it was deep in several places. I got some grasshoppers aud fished, aud another and I, we catched a dish of fish, some perch, and a kind of fish they called \"chub.\" The others went a-hunting, and killed deer and turkeys. The Governor had graving irons, but could not grave anything, the stone was so hard. I graved my name on a tree by the river side, and the Governor buried a bottle with a paper enclosed, on which he writ that he took possession of this place, in the name and for King George First of England. We had a good dinner, and after it we got the men together and loaded all their arms, and we drank the King's health in champagne and fired a volley, the Princess's health in Burgundy and fired a volley, and all the rest of the royal family in claret aud a volley. We drank the Governor's health and fired another volley. We had several sorts of liquors, viz., Virginia red wine and white wine, Irish usquebaugh, brandy, shrub, two sorts of rum, champagne, canary, cherry punch, water, cider, &c. I sent two of the rangers to look for nry gun which I dropped in the mountain ; they found it and brought it to me at night, and I gave them a pistol for their trouble. We called the highest mountain \"Mount George,\" and the one we crossed over, \"Mount Spotswood.\" yth. \u2014 At seven in the morning we mounted our horses and parted with the rangers who were to go farther on, aud we returned homewards. We repassed the mountains, aud at five in the afternoon , we came to Hospital Camp, where we lest our sick men aud heavy baggage, aud we found all things well and safe. We encamped here and called it, Captain Clonder's Camp."], [180, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 148 8th.\u2014 At nine, we were all on horseback.

Made twenty nriles this day. 9th.\u2014 We set out at nine of the clock, and before twelve, we saw several bears, and killed three. One of them attacked one of our men that was riding after him, and narrowly missed him ; he tore his things that he had behind him from off the horse, and would have destroyed him had he not had immediate help from the other men and our dogs. Some of the dogs suf fered severely in this engagement. At two we crossed orre of the branches of the Rappahannock River, and at five we encamped on the side of the Rapid Ann, on a tract of land that Mr. Beverly* hath design to take up. We made this day twenty-three nriles, and called this Captain Smith's Camp. We ate part of one of the bears, which tasted very well, and would be good and might pass for veal if one did not know what it was. We were very merry, and diverted ourselves with our adventures. ioth. \u2014 At eight we were on horseback, and aboirt ten, as we were going up a small hill, Mr. Beverly and his horse fell down, and they both rolled to the bottom ; but there were no bones broken on either side. At twelve, as we were crossing a run of water, Mr. Clonder fell in, so we called this place Clonder's Run. At one we arrived at a large spring, where we dined and drank a bowl of punch. We called this, Fontaine's Spring. About two we got on horse-back, and at four we reached Ger manna. Governor Spotswood is recognized as one of Virginia's wisest Governors, combining many noble virtues with that fine executive ability which gave the best direction to the highest efforts. He it was who pressed the passage of an Act for improving the staple of tobacco and making tobacco-notes the medium of circulation. Being a thorough soldier, he kept the militia in excellent discipline. He was master of mathematics, built the octagon magazine at Williamsburg, which still stands, and rebuilt William and Mary College. At his request, a grant of was made by the college in 1718, and a fund created for instructing Indian children in Christianity. A school for this purpose was established at Fort Christiana, on the south side of Meherrin River, in what is now Southampton County. Under his wise leader ship, Virginia paid her taxes in tobacco, and alone of all the Colonies had no public debt, no banks, no bills of credit, and * Mr. E.

He urged upon the mother country the policy of establishing a chain of posts beyond the mountains, from the lakes to the Mississippi, to restrain the encroach ments of the French, but his voice fell upon a deaf ear, though, }'ears afterwards, his scheme was carried out. The authors of Universal History say, that about the year 1716 Governor Spotswood of Virginia proposed to purchase some of the lands belonging to the Outaowais (since called the Twightees) on the river Ohio, and to erect a company for opening a trade to the southward, westward, and northward of that river; and that this proposal gave rise to the Ohio Company. \"This noble project,\" they proceed to observe, \"clashing with the views of the French, who had by this time formed their great schemes on the Mississippi, and the ministry of George I. having reasons for keeping well with that Court, the scheme was not merely relinquished, but the French were encouraged to build the fort of Crown Point on the territory of New York.\" Long after this suggestion of Governor Spotswood, in 1716, after the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, October 7, 1748, in the year 1749, some influential persons in Virginia and Eng land associated under the name of \"The Ohio Company\" and obtained from the Crown a grant of 600,000 acres of land about the Ohio River. This grant alarmed the French as being calculated to prevent the junction of Canada and Louisiana, and was the first link in a chain of causes which produced the ensuing wars between England and France. Had Governor Spotswood's timely warning been listened to, a bloody war might have been averted ; but his advice was unheeded by England, and the Colonies had in later times to suffer for this neglected opportunity. Many and great were the benefits which Governor Spots wood sought to bestow upon the home of his adoption, but, in the midst of his wise and spirited exertions for the advancement of the Colony, he fell into disfavor with the clergy, who effected his removal as Governor, in September, 1722.

In 1730 he was made Dep uty Postmaster- General for the American Colonies, and held the office until 1739, and it was he who made Benjamin Franklin postmaster for the province of Pennsylvania. He married in 1724, Anne Butler, daughter of Richard Brayane, Esq., of England, and this lady subsequently married Rev. John Thompson. Governor Spotswood had four children, John, Robert, Anne Catherine, and Dorothea. Anne Cath erine married Bernard Moore, of Chelsea, in King William County; their daughter married Charles Carter, of Shirley, and was the grandmother of General Robert Edward Lee. Governor Spotswood died at Annapolis, Md., June 7, 1740, on the eve of embarking in command of the four battalions raised in the Colonies to assist England in the attack upon Carthagena. He was buried at \"Temple Farm,\" his coun try-seat, near Yorktown. The place derived its name from a house in the garden built by Spotswood as a cemetery, and was destined to become famous in history.

In order to relieve the colonists from a poll-tax, a duty was laid by the Assembly on the importation of liquors and slaves, but owing to the opposition of the African Company, the Act was annulled by the British Board of Trade. Governor Drysdale announced to the House of Burgesses that \"the interfering interest of the African Company had obtained the repeal of that law.\" The planters beheld with dismay the alarming increase of negroes, but, as was said by one unbiased by hostility to England, \"the British government constantly checked the attempts of Virginia to put a stop to this infernal traffic.\" In June, 1712, Queen Anne, in her speech to Par liament, boasts of her success in securing to Englishmen a new market for slaves in Spanish America. George II. favored the custom, and soon every obstruction to private enterprise was removed and the ports of Africa laid open to English competition. The statute declared that \"the slave trade is very advantageous to Great Britain,\" and so, this great sin, though forced upon Virginia, became in the lapse of years its own avenger.

King George I. of England having died, nth June, 1727, William Gooch assumed the reins of government in Virginia, in the first year of the reign of George II. Governor Gooch was born at Yarmouth, England, 21st October, 1681. He was educated for the army, served under Marlborough, and was an officer of superior military ability. His course as Chief Magis trate in Virginia has always met with unqualified commenda tion, and so wise was the policy he adopted, that he is said to have been the only colonial Governor in America against whom, at home and abroad, there was never a shadow of complaint. Virginia enjoyed prosperity and repose under his adminis tration. In 1728 the boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina was satisfactorily settled, an act of great importance to the inhabitants of these Colonies who lived on their respective borders.

June, 1740, to July, 1741. James Blair was born in Scotland, in 1655. Having been educated for the Church, he became one of its most zealous champions, and was sent by the Bishop of London, in 1685, as a missionary to Virginia. He was the minister of Henrico parish for nine years, and then moved to Jamestown in order to be more convenient to the college which he was raising up. He had been made Commissary of the Bishop of London, and in 17 10 he became the Minister of Bruton parish. He was largely instrumental in procuring the charter for William and Mary College, and a grant of twenty thousand acres of land for its support. The King himself subscribed ,\u00a32,000 towards its building, out of the quit- rents. Seymour, the Attorney-General of Great Britain, remon strated against such liberality, urging that the nation was engaged in an expensive war. Commissary Blair in reply said, that the institution was for the education of young men to be ministers of the gospel, and suggested that the people of Virginia had souls to be saved, as well as the people of England. \"Souls! \" exclaimed Seymour, \"damn your souls ! make tobacco !

SIR WILLIAM GOOCH. L ieutcnant- Governor. July, 1741, to June 20, 1749. Upon the accession of George I., King of England, 1714, the Continental Colonies counted 375,750 white inhabitants and 58,850 black, and were increasing with unexampled rapidity. The love of popular power was alive everywhere, and a period of tranquility necessary to healthy progress was vouchsafed the country. In the different Colonies the spirit of liberty and desire for self-government prevailed, and Amer ica, by a slow but steady growth, was unconsciously ripening for independence. But neither the threatening troubles of England on the North with France, nor her wars on the South with Spain, neither the invasion by the mother coun try of colonial rights, nor the growing and palpable necessity for co-operation, had yet moved the Colonies to common action. During this time of advance and prosperity, William Gooch, returning from the expedition against Carthagena, assumed again the government of Virginia. During his administration the settlement of the beautiful valley of Vir ginia was effected, in 1734. Through reports brought back by Governor Spotswood and party of this fertile region, settlers were induced to visit it, and this led to its permanent occupation. It is narrated that one of these settlers carried a young buffalo calf to Williamsburg and presented it to Governor Gooch. In return the Governor gave him a grant for five thousand acres of land in the valley, upon condition that he would, within ten years, settle one hundred families upon it. Governor Gooch returned to England in 1749, having been previously created a Baronet, and in 1747 was made a Major-General. On his departure he left John Rob inson, President of the Council, as Acting Governor of the Colony. Sir William Gooch died December 17, 1751."], [192, "160 LVI. JOHN ROBINSON.

The fourth son of John Robinson was Dr. John Robinson, Bishop of Bristol, and while Bishop, was British Envoy for some years at the Court of Sweden, writing while there, a history of Sweden. He was also British Plenipotentiary at the Treaty of Utrecht, being, it is supposed, the last bishop or clergy man employed in a public service of that kind. He after wards became Bishop of London, in which office he continued until his death, in 1723. Having no children, he devised his real estate to the eldest son of his brother Christopher, who had emigrated to Virginia and settled on the Rappahan nock River. This Christopher was a vestryman in the church in Middlesex County, in 1664. He married Miss Bertram, and their oldest son (who inherited the Bishop of London's estate) was John Robinson, born in 1683. He married Catherine Beverley, daughter of Robert Beverley, author of \"The History of Virginia,\" and \"Speaker Robinson,\" or John Robinson, who was Speaker of the House of Burgesses and Treasurer of the Colony, was their son. John Robinson (born in 1683) occupied many important positions in the Colony.

Thomas Lee, President of the Council, succeeded Presi dent Robinson in the administration of the government of Virginia, in 1749. In this station he continued for some time, until the King thought proper to appoint him Governor of the Colony ; but he died before his commission reached him. Thomas Lee was the fourth son of Richard and Lettice (Corbin) Lee, and was descended in the third generation from Richard Lee, who emigrated from Shropshire, England, and settled in Westmoreland County, Virginia^ in 1641. This Richard Lee, known as \" The Emigrant,\" had several children ; the eldest two, John and Richard, were educated at Oxford, England, where John took his degree as Doctor of Physic, and, returning to Virginia, died before his father. Richard, the eldest son then living, born 1647, spent most of his life in study, and usually wrote his notes in Greek, He brew, or Latin, many of which are now in Virginia. He was a member of the Council in Virginia, and held other offices of honor and profit. He married Lettice Corbin, daughter of Henry Corbin, Gentleman. She died October 6, 1706, aged 49 years, and left the following children, viz.: Richard, Philip, Francis, Thomas, Henry, aud Mary. Philip is the progenitor of Francis Lee Smith, to whom this book, in deep veneration, is dedicated. Thomas is the subject of the pres ent article, and Henry is the progenitor of General Robert Edward Lee. In Cople Parish, in the Burnt-House fields, at Mount Pleasant, Westmoreland County, Virginia, is a tombstone with Latin inscriptions, of which the following are transla tions, viz.: First:"], [195, "THOMAS LEE. 163 \" Here Heth the body of Richard Lee, Esq'r, born in Virginia, son of Richard Lee, Gentleman, descended of an ancient family osMerton-Regis, in Shropshire.\" \"While he exercised the office of a magistrate he was a zealous pro moter of the public good.

A most affectionate mother, she was also distinguished by piety toward God, charity to the poor, and kindness to all. She died on the 6th day of October, 1706, in the 49th year of her age. The will of the first Richard Lee, dated 1663, can be seen in Mr. Charles Campbell's History of Virginia, p. 157. He was devoted to Virginia, and was bent on settling all of his family in the Colony. So firm was he in this purpose that by his will he ordered an estate he had in England, near Stratford-by-Bow, in Middlesex, at that time worth eight or nine hundred pounds per annum, to be sold and the money to be divided among his children. The value of this settle ment in the Colony of Virginia is read in the pages of her history. Thomas Lee was born about the year 1680, and (as says his son William) \" though with none but a common Virginia education, yet having strong natural parts, long after he was a man he learned the languages without any assistance but his own genius, and became a tolerable adept in the Greek and Latin. By his industry and parts he acquired a consid erable fortune, and though he had very few acquaintances in England, he was so well known by his reputation that upon his receiving a loss by fire the late Queen Caroline sent him over a bountiful present out of her own privy purse.\" This establishes the source from whence came the means of building the present house at Stratford, in Westmoreland County, Vir ginia.

His mother was Sarah, daughter of Matthew Cumming, who was Bailie of Glasgow in 1691, 1696, and 1699. Governor Dinwiddie was born at his father's seat, \"Germiston,\" in 1693.

It was decisive of war. The services of this young Virginian were highly appreciated.

The one, the conqueror Wolfe, died in the arms of victory, saying with his expiring breath, \"Then I die happy\"; the other, the conquered Montcalm, when told his wound was mortal, exclaimed, \"I am glad of it; so much the better; I shall not then live to see the surrender of Quebec.\" IT.\"."], [208, "176 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. In the midst of these triumphs to the British arms, the King of England, George II., died suddenly, October 25, 1760, and was succeeded by George III., his grandson. . Affairs in Virginia now progressed quietly, and her popu lation increased rapidly. Washington, after several years of active service against the Indians and the French, had laid down his sword and retired for a season to the shades of Mount Vernon. Virginia was slowly preparing herself, all uncon scious of her destiny, for those high duties which the future held in store for her. In 1765, the passage of \"The Stamp Act,\" in London, waked the Slogan in America. It was viewed as a violation of the British Constitution, and as destructive of the first principles of liberty. At this momen tous period, there arose in Virginia a man whose burning eloquence fired the souls and nerved the arms of the Colo nists to strike for \"liberty or death.\" It was a memorable day, when in the House of Burgesses, Patrick Henry stood holding in his hand the Resolutions (against submitting to the Stamp Act,) which he had traced with a pencil upon the leaf of an old book. Portentous hour ! Quivering in the balance \u2014 a race of vassals, or a great and liberated people ! Henry was unknown to fame, and with his plain, coarse garb and awkward mien, gave to the world no outward sign of the veiled genius hidden there. But, like Olympian Jove, he shook his \u00c6gis and the tempest rolled ! Felt were the thunder and the lightning of his power, and the Resolutions passed. It is much to be regretted that this burst of pas sionate appeal has not been preserved, and that only its conclusion has come down to us. \" C\u00e6sar,\" he cried, \" had his Brutus, Charles I. his Cromwell, and George III.\" Here he was interrupted by loud cries of ' ' Treason ! treason ! ' ' Henry knew that he stood upon the edge of a precipice, that the daring words he would have uttered would reveal too much ; so with a prudence as masterful as was his valor, he continued, \"and George III. may profit by their example. If this be treason, make the most of it ! \" The news of the adoption of these celebrated Resolutions spread like wildfire throughout the whole country. They set"], [209, "FRANCIS FAUQUIER. 177 forth the facts that Virginians had a right to all the privileges of English subjects ; that, having no representatives in Parliament, they should not be taxed by Parliament; that the right of these Colonies to tax themselves had always been recognized by the Kings and Parliaments of England ; and that no one had a right to tax Virginians but the General Assembly of Virginia, and to submit to anything else would destroy American freedom. The other Colonies adopted similar resolutions, and determined that nothing bearing the stamp of England should come into the country. This had the effect of encouraging home institutions, and was another step in the gradual cutting loose from old relations. Governor Fauquier, in the progress of all these stirring events, preserved the respect of the people over whom he presided. He died March 3, 1768, and until the arrival of Lord Botetourt in October following, the government again devolved on John Blair, President of the Council. The following address and resolutions of the patriots of the Northern Neck of Virginia, in the year 1765, immediately after the passage of the Stamp Act, were drawn up by Richard Henry Lee. It is said to have been the first public associa tion in the land for resistance to that Act, and fittingly finds a place under this brief review of Governor Fauquier' s term of office. \" Roused by danger, and alarmed at attempts, foreign and domestic, to reduce the people of this country to a state of abject and detestable slavery, by destroying that free and happy constitution of government under which they have hitherto lived ; We, who subscribe this paper, have associated, and do bind ourselves to each other, to God, and to our country, by the firmest ties that religion aud virtue can frame, most sacredly and punctu ally to stand by, and with our lives and fortunes to support, maintain, and defend each other in the observance and execution of these following Articles : \"First. \u2014 We declare all due allegiance and obedience to our lawful Sovereign, George the Third, King of Great Britain.

Perhaps none of the Colonial Governors appears in the list of Virginia's executives with such a distinguished mili tary'record as Sir Jeffrey Amherst; none certainly had his dreams of ambition more fully realized, and none reaped in ampler measure the honorable rewards of a grateful country. He had the honor of laying Canada at the foot of the British throne, and of destroying French supremacy in this coveted possession. Lord Jeffrey Amherst was descended from an ancient Kentish family near Seven-Oaks, where he was born in 1 71 7. He early devoted himself to the profession of Arms, receiving an Ensign's commission when only fourteen years of age. When twenty-five years old, he acted as aide-de camp to Lord Ligonier in the battles of Dettingen and Fon tenoy, and afterwards served on the staff of the Duke of Cumberland at Laffield and Hastenbeck. In 1756 he received the colonelcy of a regiment, and was appointed Major-General, and in the summer of 1758 commanded the expedition against Louisburg, which, together with the whole island of Cape Breton, surrendered to his arms. The capture of Fort du Quesne, Niagara, Ticonderoga, and Que bec in due time followed, and in 1760, the whole of Canada being reduced, General Amherst received for his share in these exploits the thanks of the House of Commons and the Order of the Bath. In 1763, he was made Governor of Vir ginia; in 1770, Governor of the Isle of Jersey, and in 1772, Lieutenant-General of the ordnance, and officiating Com mander-in-Chief of the English forces. Besides these and several other military honors, he was in 1776 created a peer,"], [214, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 182 \\>y the title of Baron Amherst of Holmesdale, in the County of Kent. On the breaking up of the ' ' North ' ' administration, Lord Amherst was removed from the commandership-in chief and the lieutenancy of the ordnance, but in 1787 received another patent of peerage as Baron Amherst of Mon treal, with remainder to his nephew, William Pitt Amherst. On the staff being reappointed in 1793, he was once more called upon to act as Commander-in-Chief. In 1795 he resigned the commandership-in-chief to the Duke of York, and in 1796 received the rank of Field Marshal. He died in 1797, in the eighty-first year of his age. Lord Amherst was twice married, but left no children. He was made Governor of Virginia in 1763, but when, in 1768, it was desired by the Ministry that he should reside in the Col ony, he resigned the office and was succeeded in July, by Lord Botetourt. Amherst County, Virginia, was named in honor of Lord Amherst. He is represented as a man of collected and temperate mind, not given to parade or ostentation, a strict officer, yet the soldier's friend. It is also written in history that \" Sir Jeffrey Amherst, in his advice to the Ministry, stren uously opposed the repeal of the Stamp Act. ' ' How different was it with the noble Pitt ! In this present age of the glory and power of America, when the public mind turns to commemorate the virtues and valor and talents of her earliest and best friends, should William Pitt be quite forgotten ? Foreseeing the sep aration of the American Colonies from the mother country, if the arbitrary measures then adopted should be continued, he advocated in the House of Commons, especially in 1766, a conciliatory policy and the repeal of the Stamp Act. In the House of Lords, as Lord Chatham, he continued to recom mend the abandonment of the coercive measures employed against America, particularly in 1774; but his warning was rejected, and in 1776 the Colonies declared themselves inde pendent. He still, however, labored in the cause, and used all his efforts to induce the government to effect a reconcili ation with the American states ; and as he was speaking with his accustomed energy on the subject in the House of Lords, April 7, 1778, he fell. He died on the nth of the following"], [215, "SIR fEFFREY AMHERST. 183 month. Who that has followed his burning appeals for Amer ica can doubt, if he had lived on this side of the Atlantic, that his name today would be a household word, as deeply rever enced as any of the Revolutionary heroes? With deep emo tion do we read these words of one of England's most illus trious statesmen, orators, and patriots, and gratefully remem ber him, who turned from his high estate of power and grandeur to become a party in the distant colonial struggle : ' ' On a question that may mortally wound the freedom of three mil lions of virtuous and brave subjects beyond the Atlantic Ocean, I cannot be silent. America, being neither really nor virtually represented in Westminster, cannot be held legally, or constitutionally, or reasonably, subject to obedieuce to any money bill of this kingdom. The Colonies are equally entitled with yourselves to all the natural rights of mankind, aud the peculiar privileges of Englishmen ; equahy bound by the laws, and equally participating of the Constitution of this free country. ' ' * ' ' Taxation is no part of the governing power. The taxes are a voluntary gift and grant of the Commons alone. In an American tax, what do we do? We, your Majesty's Commons of Great Britain, give and grant to your Majesty \u2014 what ? Our own property ? No. We give and grant to your Majesty the property of your Majesty's Commons in America. It is an absurdity in terms. \" * * * * * * \"The Commons of America, represented in their several Assemblies, have ever been in possession of the exercise of this, their Constitutional right, of giving and granting their own money. They would have been slaves if they had not enjoyed it.\" ******** \" I never shall own the justice of taxing America internally, until she enjoys the right of representation.\" ****** \" No man more highly esteems and honors the British troops than I do ; I know their virtues and their valor ; I know they can achieve any thing but impossibilities ; and I know that the conquest of British America is an impossibility. You cannot, my lords, you cannot conquer America. *********** \" You may swell every expense, and accumulate every assistance, and extend your traffic to the shambles of every German despot ; your attempts will be forever vain and impotent \u2014 doubly so, indeed, from this mercenary aid on which you rely ; for it irritates to an incurable resent ment the minds of your adversaries, to overrun them with the mercenary sons of rapine and plunder, devoting them and their possessions to the rapacity of hireling cruelty. If I were an American, as I am an English man, while a foreign troop remained in my country I never would lay down my arms ; no, never, never, never ! \" He fought for the Colonies afar, upon the battle-field of"], [216, "THE GOVERNORS OF V/RGINIA. 184 parliamentary debate, and in the fervor of his demand for justice to the oppressed, glowing with thoughts that had for years weighed heavy on his heart \u2014 he fell, all suddenly, into the arms of death \u2014 but, from his pinnacle of fame, his dying plea was for \u2014 America! Macaulay thus describes him when at the zenith of his power : \"The situation which Pitt occupied at the close of the reign of George the Second was the most enviable ever occupied by any public man in English history. He had conciliated the King ; he domineered over the House of Commons ; he was adored by the people ; he was admired by all Europe. He was the first Englishman of his time, and he had made England the first country in the world. The Great Commoner \u2014 the name by which he was often designated \u2014 might look down with scorn on coro nets and garters. The nation was drunk with joy and pride. The Parlia ment was as quiet as it had been under Pelhanr. The old party distinctions were almost effaced ; nor was their place yet supplied by distinctions of a yet more important kind. A new generation of country squires and rectors had arisen, who knew not the Stirarts. The Dissenters were tolerated ; the Catholics not cruelly persecuted ; the Church was drowsy and indul gent. The great civil and religious conflict which began at the Reforma tion seemed to have terminated in universal repose. Whigs and Tories, Churchmen aud Puritans, spoke with equal reverence of the Constitution, and with equal enthusiasm of the talents, virtues, and services of the Minister.\" And now that in this country, the Washington monument towers all other shafts beyond ; now that Virginia has raised her triumphal memorial at Old Yorktown, and Vermont has lifted her battle column at Bennington ; now that Columbus will be remembered in the greatest exhibition of the world's progress ever seen, should America forget the noble Pitt, he who defied kings and princes and the sweet voice of popular applause, to tell the story of her wrongs, and who planted his name on the side of her constitutional liberties? \" No, never, never, never ! \""], [217, "LXIV. JOHN BLAIR. President of the Council. March 3, 1768, to October, 1768. Lord Botetourt was appointed Governor-in-Chief of Virginia in July, 1768, though he did not arrive in the Col- ony until the October following. Governor Fauquier having died March 3, 1768, until the arrival of Lord Botetourt in the following October, John Blair, \"President of the Council,\" was the acting Governor of the Colony. During the trying period of the incumbency of President Blair, his ability and fidelity were conspicuously displayed. Although Parliament had repealed the obnoxious Stamp Act in 1766, the next year witnessed their imposing duties to be paid by the Colonists on paper, glass, painters' colors, and teas imported into the Col- onies. This, with the attempt to enforce the Act to provide quarters for British soldiers in the Colonies, at the expense of the Colonies, again excited public indignation and alarm. Massachusetts guardedly and reluctantly consented, but New York declined making the provision demanded. For this offence, Parliament passed an Act for restraining the Assembly of New York from passing any Act until they should comply with this requisition. This arbitrary Act fanned the flame of suspicion and discontent among all the Colonies. \"An Act for suspending the Legislature of that province,\" said Richard Henry Lee, \"hangs like a flaming sword over our heads, and requires, by all means, to be removed.\" Again Parliament passed an Act for establishing a Custom House in America in 1767. The discussions occasioned by the Stamp Act had convinced the Colonists of their exemption from par liamentary taxation, and so they were on the alert at every attempt of England in this direction. This new occasion of XIII 185"], [218, "186 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. dissatisfaction roused afresh the suspicions of the Colonists and some Essays on Colonial rights under the name of ' ' Let ters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania to the Inhabitants of the British Colonies\" had a rapid and extensive circulation in America.

' ' Massachusetts sent a petition to the King against these recent acts of Parliament and issued a circular letter to the other Colonies to unite in suitable measures to obtain redress. Virginia sent a memorial to the House of Lords and a remon strance to the House of Commons, complaining of the taxes imposed, and her action and that of Massachusetts were fully endorsed by the House of Assembly in Georgia. During this stormy period Governor Blair held the reins of government in Virginia from March to October of 1768, the last patent signed by him bearing date the 24th October, 1768. He had served for several years as Deputy Auditor of the Colony and had also been a visitor of William and Mary College. His life was one of varied usefulness in a time that tried men's souls.

October 28, 1768, to October 15, 1770. It is said by Bancroft that \" Botetourt, the new Governor of Virginia, arrived on the James River in the delicious season of the fall of the leaf, when that region enjoys a many-tinted sky and a soft, but invigorating air. He was charmed with the scenes on which he entered ; his house seemed admirable, the grounds around it well planted and watered by beautiful rills. Everything was just as he could have wished. Coming up without state to an unprovided residence, he was asked abroad every day, and, asa guest, gave pleasure and was pleased. He thought nothing could be better than the disposition of the Colon}-, and augured well of even-thing that was to happen. \"He was persuaded that the new Assembly would come together in good humor, which he was resolved not wantonly to disturb.\" But the year after Lord Botetourt arrived, the Assembly passed two resolutions : First, that Virginia would no longer submit to be taxed by England; and, second, that she would not send her criminals to England to be tried. Lord Bote tourt knew that Virginia was right in this, but he thought that his duty to his King compelled him to check what seemed rebellion. He said to the Assembly : \" I have heard of your resolves, and augur ill of their effects ; you have made it my duty to dissolve you, and you are dissolved accordingly.\" But, though the Governor dissolved the Assembly, he could not disperse its members. The spirit of freedom was aroused in every patriot breast, and instead of returning quietly to their homes, the Burgesses met at a private house in Williamsburg and adopted resolutions which Washington had brought with him from Mount Vernon, and w,"], [220, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 188 \"which formed a well-digested, stringent, and practicable scheme of non-importation, until all the ' unconstitutional ' revenue acts should be repealed.\" They also made a special covenant with one another not to import any slaves, nor purchase any imported. These compacts were signed by Peyton Randolph, Richard Bland, Archibald Cary, Robert Carter Nicholas, Richard Henry Lee, Washington, Jefferson, Henry, Carter Braxton, Nelson, and all the Burgesses there assembled, and were then sent throughout the Colony for every man to sign. Virginia stirred the smouldering spirit of Pennsylvania to endorse her action ; Delaware adopted the resolutions of the Old Dominion, and every Colony south of her followed her example. So determined were the colonists, that when some time later a vessel loaded with tea entered Boston Harbor, a number of citizens disguised as Indians went on board of the ship at night, and threw overboard three hun dred and forty-two chests of tea. America confined its issue with Great Britain to the repeal of the Act imposing a duty on Tea, because of the prin ciple of the Act, expressed in the preamble. England was, at this time, in a most perplexed condition as to her policy. Junius, with his firebrands, had heated the atmosphere of society ; the Ministry often divided, and the King, unequal to the situation, had almost filled the measure of colonial dissatisfaction, and Revolution in America, hover ing on the confines of Tyranny, was steadily taking form, and passing from an idea into an action. Governor Botetourt having received assurances from the Earl of Hillsborough, Secretary of State for the Colonies, that the Ministry would advocate a repeal of the obnoxious taxes, the relations between the Governor and the colonial legislative bodies were fully restored ; but, soon finding that he had been misled, Botetourt indignantly demanded his recall. Shortly after, and it is asserted, on account of his peculiar embarrassments, he fell sick, and died on October 15, 1770. His death doubtless was hastened by his troubles. Governor Botetourt was admired and respected by Virgin-"], [221, "NOR BORNE BERKELEY. 189 ians, and their appreciation of his worth is shown by their erecting a monument to his memory at Williamsburg, and naming one of their most beautiful counties after him. His example of courtesy and patience in public life, his genial affability in the social sphere, and of high honor everywhere, his fidelity to his people, and his noble Christian character, are still cherished memories among the people he loved so well."], [222, "190 LXVI. WILLIAM NELSON. President of the Council. October 15, 1770, to August, 1771 After having been President of the Council for a long term of years, on the decease of Lord Botetourt, William Nelson became the Acting Governor of the Colony. He was the son of Thomas Nelson, who came to America from Pen riff, near the border of Scotland, and hence was known as \"Scotch Tom.\" The same settled at York, in Virginia, and was the founder of that town, which was laid out in 1705. His eldest son, Thomas, was known as \" Secretary Nelson,\" because so long Secretary of the Council ; and the second son, William, or \" President Nelson,\" is the subject of this notice. He was born in 171 1, and was the father of the patriotic General Thomas Nelson, of Revolutionary fame. William Nelson is said to have laid the corner-stone of the historic Nelson House at Yorktown. Though an infant, he was held by his nurse, and the brick laid in his apron and passed through his little hands. This mansion de scended to President Nelson's eldest son, General Thomas Nelson, and was his residence until the threatened siege of York by the English, induced him to remove his family to \" Offley,\" in Hanover County. During this siege the Nelson House was occupied by Lord Cornwallis, and General Nel son's unselfish desire for its destruction is a fitting illustration of the spirit which made Virginia free. To quote from another, in describing the situation of this now celebrated town : \" The river is full a mile wide at York, which is eleven miles from its mouth, and is secir stretching itself away until it merges itself into the"], [223, "WILLIAM NELSON. 191 Chesapeake Bay. The sun rises immediately over the mouth of the river, and the water is tinged with the rainbow hues of heaven. We have watched with much iitterest the decline of day from the New York Batten-, but we doubt if New York Harbor \u2014 compared, as it is, with the Bav of Naples \u2014 ever presented to the eye a more enchanting spectacle than York River in its morning glory. Beautiful for situation is old York, stretchiirg east aud west on as noble a sheet of water as rolls beireath the sun.\" How such a scene as this must have nerved the arm of patriots, and warmed the heart of every son of liberty in the fight for freedom. And how well they fought, that monument at Yorktown, which commemorates the hundred years of liberty the}' bought, now tells the tale. President Nelson presided over the affairs of Virginia during an exciting period, but the life of the Colony seems to have progressed under his judicious sway. He died No vember 19, 1772, and the following extract from a printed sermon on his death, by Mr. Camm, President of William and Mary College, will give some idea of his character and of the position he held among his fellow-men. He was \"The kind and indulgent father, without suffering the excess of fondness to take off his eye from the true and best interests of his children ; the tender husband, the affectionate brother, the useful and entertaining friend, the kind and generous master. His hospitality was extensive and liberal, yet judicious, and not set free from the restraints of reason and religion. It was not a blind propensity to profuseness, or a passion for a name, by which he corrupted the morals of his friends and neighbors. He was no encourager of intemperance or riot, or any practice tending to injure the health, the reputation, the fortunes, or the religious attainments of his company. His charities were many, and dispensed with choice and discretion, and so as to be most serviceable to the receivers and the least oppressive to their modesty. As one of the first and most respectable merchants in this dominion, he had great opportunity of being acquainted with the circumstances of many people whose cases otherwise would have escaped his knowledge. This knowledge was often turned to their advan tage whose affairs fell under his consideration. I think I shall have the concurring voice of the public with me when I say, that his own gain by trade was not more sweet to hinr than the help which he hereby received toward becoming a general benefactor. He was an instance of what abundance of good may be done by a prudent and conscientious man, without impoverishing himself or his connections\u2014 nay, while his fortunes are improving. An estate raised with an unblemished reputation, and"], [224, "192 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. diffused frorrr humane and devout motives in the service of multitudes as well as the owner's, it may reasonably be expected will wear well, and have the blessing of Providence to attend and protect it frorrr generation to generation.\" Among the tombstones in the old churchyard at York, Virginia, may be seen one with the following inscription : \" Here lies the body of the Honorable William Nelson, Esquire, late President of his Majesty's Council in this Dominion, in whom the love of man and the love of God so restrained and enforced each other, and so invigorated the mental powers in general, as not only to defend him frorrr the vices and follies of his age and country, but, also to rerrder it a nratter of difficult decision in what part of laudable conduct he most excelled ; whether in the tender and endearing accomplishments of domestic life, or in the rrrore arduous duties of a wider circuit ; whether as a neighbor, a gentleman, or a magistrate ; whether in the graces of hospitality or pietv.

July, 1771, to June, 1775 Earl Dunmore had been appointed Governor of New York, January, 1770, and of Virginia in July, 1771. He was born in 1732, and was descended in the female line from the royal house of Stuart. He succeeded to the peerage in 1756, and is described as a man of culture \u2014 this, indeed, seems to be the only commendation which history accords him. The people of Virginia, conciliated by Lord Dunmore's apparent friendliness, desired through their Assembly to honor permanently his name, and that of his eldest son, George, Lord Fincastle. By Acts passed February, 1772, the Counties of Berkeley and Dunmore were created from Frederick County, and the Count}' of Fincastle, created from the County of Botetourt. But as time went on, the relations between the Governor and his people changed, aud Dunmore and Fincastle became extinct names in the list of Virginia Counties. Dunmore was changed to Shenandoah, and Fincastle was divided into Kentucky, Washington, and Montgomery. Bancroft describes Dunmore as a man who came to Amer ica \"to amass a fortune, and in his passion for sudden gain, cared as little for the policy of the Ministers or his instruc tions from the Crown, as for the rights of property, the respective limits of jurisdiction of the Colonies, or their civil and political privileges. To get money for himself was his whole system.\" He became arbitrary in his rule in Virginia"], [226, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 194 \u2014 prorogued the House of Burgesses from time to time as it suited his pleasure, until at last, a forgery of the paper cur rency of the Colony compelled him to call the Assembly together again, by proclamation, March 4, 1773. An English armed revenue vessel having been burned in Narragansett Bay, an Act of Parliament passed, making such offences punishable with death, and ordering the accused to be sent to England for trial. This was in direct violation of Virginia's remonstrance in 1769, and thus was another torch added to the fire of liberty which was spreading far and wide over the continent. During these dark and threatening days, some of the Vir ginia patriots were in the habit of meeting together in the evening, in a private room in the Old Ralegh Tavern at Williamsburg. Here they laid their plans and here they pledged a common vow to make their country free. Whether that vow should become a reality, rested on Virginia. Her Assembly came together on the 4th of March, 1773. Says Bancroft : \"Its members had authentic information of the proceedings of the Town of Boston, and public rumors had reached them of the commission for inquiring into the affairs of Rhode Island. Thev had read aird approved of the answers which the Council and the House, of Massachusetts, had made in January, to the speech of Hutchinson, their execrated Governor. They formed themselves, therefore, irrto a committee of the whole House, on the state of the Colony, and in that committee, Dabncy Carr, of Charlotte, a young statesman of brilliant genius as well as fervid patriotism, moved a series of Resolutions for a system of intercolonial committees of correspouderree. His plan included a thorough union of Councils throughout the continent. If it should succeed and be adopted by the other Colonies, Anrerica would stand before the world as a Confed eracy. The measure was supported by Richard Henry- Lee, with au eloquence which never passed away from the memory of his hearers ; b\\- Patrick Henry, with more commanding majesty. The Assembly did what greattress of mind counselled ; and they did it quietly, as if it were but natural to therrr to act with magnanimity. On Friday, the twelfth of March, the Resolutions were reported to the House and unanimously adopted. They appointed their committee, on which appear the names of Bland and Lee, of Henry and Carr and Jefferson. Their resolves were sent to every Colony, with a request that each would appoint its Com mittee to communicate from time to time with that of Virginia. In this"], [227, "JOHN MURRAY. 195 manner, Virginia laid the foundation of our Union \" The associates of Dabney Carr were spared for further service to humanity. He, himself, was cut down in his prime, and passed away like a shadow ; but the name of him who, at this moment of crisis, beckoned the Colonies onward to union, must not perish from the memory of his countrymen.\" Richard Henry Lee is said by others to have been the au thor of the plan of inter-colonial committees of correspondence, and that it was in the Old Ralegh Tavern agreed that Carr should present the matter to the House of Burgesses. On the day after the dissolution of this Assembly the Committee ap pointed by it addressed a circular to the other American Colo nies. Thus, steadily were the battalions of freedom forming ! \"Glorious Virginia,\" cried the Assembly of Rhode Island, glowing with admiration for ' ' its patriotic and illustrious House of Burgesses,\" and this brave little New England Colony was the first to follow the example of the Old Domin ion, \"by electing its committee and sending its circular through the land.\" We now enter upon a period of misrule which soon event uated in the activities of a Revolution. In 1773, the last laws were passed in Virginia under the colonial government. In 1774, no laws were passed. At the Assembly which met June 1, 1775, no laws were enacted. Governor Dunmore dissolved on the 26th May, 1774, an Assembly, because the House of Burgesses had by a resolution on the 24th of May, set apart the 1st day of June (the day on which the Boston Port Bill took effect) as a day of \"fasting, humiliation, and' prayer, ' ' and ordered a sermon to be preached suitable to the occasion. On the dissolution of the Assembly by Dun more, the Burgesses repaired immediately to the Ralegh Tavern, and in the \"Apollo\" room adopted resolutions against the use of tea and other imported commodities, and recommended an annual Congress of representatives of the Colonies. On the 29th of May, the Burgesses held a meeting, at which Peyton Randolph presided, and they is sued a Circular calling an assembly of deputies to meet in convention in Williamsburg, the 1st of August follow-"], [228, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 196 ing. This was the first public Revolutionary assemblage. Aud now, in the midst of turmoil and distress at the seat of government, the war-whoop of the savage was again heard on the frontiers of the Colony. The white men seem to have commenced the trouble, or rather to have pun ished small offences of the Indians, by the spilling of blood. This roused the tribes to fury and they wreaked their ven geance on the frontier settlements. An army was raised and placed under the command of General Lewis, who marched to Point Pleasant, where the Kanawha River empties into the Ohio. Here ensued a bloody battle. The Indians were led on by a gigantic warrior named \" Cornstalk,\" and they fought with great desperation. When all seemed lost for the Virginians, a reinforcement arrived under Colonel Fleming, who, adopting the Indian method of shooting from behind trees, turned the tide of battle, which finally resulted in a complete, though dearly bought, victory. The Virginians lost 140 men, among whom were many valuable officers. Governor Dunmore, who had promised to join General Lewis, took another direction, and some eighty miles distant, made his camp. Not to his prowess as a soldier, but to his position as Governor, do we read that \"Lord Dunmore secured a treaty of peace with the savages.\" Dunmore now concluded a treaty with the various Indian tribes, and at this pacification the celebrated speech of Logan, the Cayuga chief, was delivered. The circumstances relating to this subject are, according to Thomas Jefferson, as follows: \" In the spring of the year 1774, a robbery was committed by some Indians on certain land-adventurers on the river Ohio. The whites in that quarter, according to their custom , uirdertook to punish this outrage in a summary way. Captain Michael Crcsap, and a certaiir Daniel Great house, leading on these parties, surprised, at different times, travelling and hunting parties of the Indians, having their women aird children with thent, and murdered many. Among these were unfortunately the family of Logan, a chief celebrated in peace aud war, and long distinguished as a friend of the whites. This unworthy return provoked his vengeance. He accordingly signalized himself in the war which ensued. In the autumn of the same year a decisive battle was fought at the mouth of the Great Kahaway, between the collected forces of the Shawancse, Mingoes"], [229, "JOHN MURRAY. 197 and Delawares, and a detachment of the Virginia militia. The Indians were defeated and sued for peace. Logan, however, disdained to be seen among the suppliants. But, lest the sincerity of a treaty should be dis trusted, from which so distinguished a chief abserrted himself, he sent, by a messenger, the following speech to be delivered to Lord Dunmore : ' ' I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry and he gave him not meat ;' if ever he came cold and naked and he clothed him not. During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that nry countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \" Logan is the friend of white men.\" I had even thought to have lived with you, but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Crcsap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing nry women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called 011 me for revenge. I have sought it ; I have killed many ; I have fully glutted my vengeance ; for my country I rejoice at the beams of peace ; but do not harbour a thought that ntine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.'\" Early in 1775, the people of Virginia called another Con vention, which met in Richmond on the 20th March. Upon an eminence which is now called \"Church Hill,\" stands an old wooden church, and it was in this \"St. John's Church\" that the Convention met to deliberate upon the situation. Here Patrick Henry voiced the people's hopes and sounded that tocsin of liberty whose peals resounded over all the land. Lord Dunmore, alarmed at the threatening aspect of affairs, caused the removal of the powder from the magazine at Wil liamsburg to an English ship. The people flew to arms under Patrick Henry, and Dunmore was forced to pay for the powder. On the 6th of June he fled with his family and took refuge on board the -Forney, a man-of-war. What a contrast does Lord Dunmore's exit from Virginia, present to his entrance, only three short years before ! Behold him on his coming, received with expressions of warmth and affec tion by the Assembly ; later, 'two counties called in honor of his family ; a daughter born in the Colony and named ' ' Vir ginia,\" formally adopted by the Assembly as the Daughter of the Dominion, with provision for her life support; and then behold Lord Dunmore, seeking to deprive Virginians of"], [230, "198 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. the means of self-defence, and in the dead of night removing all the powder from the magazine in Williamsburg ; behold him fleeing in conscious guilt to the Fowey ; behold him plundering the inhabitants along the James and York Rivers and carrying off their slaves ; behold him making battle at Great Bridge, and with a last, fell stroke, firing and destroy ing Norfolk, the most flourishing town in Virginia ! History records these painful facts, and it is wise for the descend ants of the Revolutionary Fathers to remember through what deep seas of suffering these heroes struggled to their freedom !

President of The Virginia Convention of August, IJJJ, The Virginia Convention of March, 1J75, The Virginia Convention of July, 1775. Never since the foundation of Virginia had there been greater need of wisdom and courage in her people than was necessary in the critical juncture now at hand, and not in vain did the occasion summon the indignant Colonists to high and patriotic duties. Standing face to face with a great crisis which they intrepidly resolved to meet, they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to the conflict, and shoulder to shoulder moved on to the momentous issue of ' ' liberty or death.\" Peyton Randolph, first President of the American Congress, was born in Virginia in 1723, and died in Phila delphia, October 22, 1775. He was the second son of Sir John Randolph, and after graduating at the College of Wil liam and Mary, went to England and studied law. On his return in 1748 he was appointed King's Attorney-General for the Colony, was chosen a member of the House of Bur gesses, and was chairman of a committee to revise the laws of the Colony. In 1764 he drew up the address of the Burgesses to the King, against the passage of the Stamp Act. In 1765, after that Act became a law, Randolph, with other proprietors of large estates, opposed Patrick Henry's cele brated five resolutions, being loath to cast the die of Rev olution. In the same year Virginia forwarded to Eng- 19a"], [234, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 200 land petitions similar to those adopted by the Congress, (held in the City of New York, October, 1765) with an address to the King, written by Randolph. In 1766 Randolph was made Speaker of the House of Burgesses, resigning, about the same time, his office of Attorney-General. In the measures of opposition to the English government he now took a conspicuous part. He was a member of the committee of vigilance, appointed to obtain the most accurate intelli gence of all Acts of Parliament affecting the rights of the Col onies, and authorized to open a correspondence with the other Colonies. In August, 1774, he presided in the Convention at Williamsburg, and was one of the delegates elected to the Continental Congress. On the assembling of that body in Philadelphia, in September, he was unanimously elected its President, but in consequence of ill-health, held the post only five or six weeks. InMarch, 1775, he presided over the second Convention of Virginia, at Richmond, was elected again as a delegate to Congress, and when that body met at Philadelphia on May 10, 1775, was re-elected President; but nearer duties recalling him to Virginia, he was succeeded by John Han cock. The Convention which met in Richmond, July 17, 1775, elected Peyton Randolph its President, making him thus for the third time the Moderator of the revolutionary proceedings in Virginia. But his valuable services were destined to be of short duration. He died suddenly, of apo plexy, in Philadelphia, October 22, 1775, but his remains were interred beneath the pavement of the famous \"Old Chapel\" of William and Mary College, at Williamsburg, Virginia. Of all Peyton Randolph's public services, none, perhaps, were more valuable than those he rendered in the three historic Revolutionary Conventions over which he presided in his native state. He was one of the most distinguished lawyers and patriots of his time and country, and, though not remarkable for eloquence, he derived great weight from the solid powers of his understanding, and the no less solid virtues of his heart. Besides being an eminent lawyer, he was a well-informed and practical statesman, and his thorough"], [235, "PEYTON RANDOLPH. 201 acquaintance with all forms of parliamentary proceeding made him a tower of strength in those days of anarchy and confusion. On the morning of May 25, 1774, when Lord Dunmore dissolved for the last time the Virginia House of Burgesses, the indignant members repaired immediately to the Ralegh Tavern, about one hundred paces from the Capitol, and with Peyton Randolph, their late Speaker, in the chair, held a sol emn Council. They voted that the late attack on Massachu setts was an attack on all the Colonies, which should be op posed by the u?iited wisdom of all. They advised an annual Continental Congress, and they named Peyton Randolph, with others, a Committee of Correspondence, to invite a general concurrence in this design. On the following Sunday after noon, May 29, 1774, letters from Boston reached Williams burg, of such an exciting and important nature, that the next morning, at ten o'clock, the Burgesses met, having called to their aid Washington, who was in Williamsburg at the time. Being but twenty -five in number they felt unwilling to assume the responsibility of definite measures of resistance, but summoned a Convention of delegates to be elected by the several counties, to meet at the Capitol on the first day of the ensuing August. It was in this Convention that Washington uttered the wish to raise one thousand men, subsist them at his own expense, and march at their head to the relief of Boston. It is also a point of historic interest to note, that the people of Boston endorsed ' ' the plan proposed by our noble, patriotic, sister Colony of Virginia.\" Among the great causes of colonial dissatisfaction with the mother country, we may briefly mention the Navigation Act of 165 1, the Sugar Act of 1764, the Stamp Act of 1765 ; but the spark which fired the smouldering continental discontent was the duty on Tea, which, resisted, led to the Boston Port Bill, in 1774, and this \u2014 to war. The Act which shut up the harbor of Boston was speedily followed by another, entitled, \"An Act for the better regulating the government of Massachusetts,\" and this unveiled intention of interfering with Home Rule was too much for struggling freedom. XIV"], [236, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 202 On June i, 1774, the day appointed to carry the Port Bill into operation, business was finished at Boston by twelve o'clock noon, and the harbor shut up. The day was observed through all the Colonies as a day of mourning. In this feverish condition of public feeling, the Convention, summoned to meet in Williamsburg, assembled in the old Capitol on August 1 , 1 774, and Peyton Randolph was elected its President. Here, in the \" Heart of the Rebellion,\" as this building was called, was first proclaimed in outline that noble chart of human liberty \u2014 the Declaration of American Independence. Illness detained Thomas Jefferson on the road, but he sent for inspection a paper which foreshadowed his mighty work. It was presented by Peyton Randolph, President of the Con vention, and printed by some of the delegates. Enumerating the grievances which affected all the Colonies, it made a spec ial complaint of a wrong to Virginia. \" For the most trifling reasons,\" said he, \" and sometimes for no conceivable reason at all, his Majesty has rejected laws of the most salutary tendency- The abolition of domestic slavery is the great object of desire in those Colonies where it was unhappily introduced in their infant state. But, previotrs to the enfranchisement of the slaves we have, it is necessary to exclude all further importations from Africa ; yet our repeated attempts to effect this (by prohibitions, and by imposing duties which might amount to a prohibition,) have been hitherto defeated bv his Majesty's negative, thus preferring the immediate advantage of a few British corsairs to the lasting interests of the American states, and to the rights of human nature, deeply wounded by this infamous practice.\" Of these words every heart acknowledged the justice. Moreover, the Fairfax Resolves, in which George Mason and Washington had given their solemn judgment against the slave trade, were brought by the Fairfax delegates before the Convention, and in August that body came to the unani mous vote : \"After the first day of November next, we will neither ourselves import nor purchase any slave or slaves imported by any other person, either from Africa, the West Indies, or any other place.\" In this Convention, the eloquence of Richard Henry Lee and of Patrick Henry made such profound impression, that the one was compared to Cicero and the other to Demosthenes,"], [237, "PEYTON RANDOLPH. 203 and Washington declared, \" The crisis is arrived when we must assert our rights or submit to every imposition that can be heaped upon us, till custom and use shall make us tame and abject slaves.\" The great lawyer, Thomson Mason, of Virginia, denied, through the press, the right of England to make laws for the Colonies, and exclaimed, \"I do not wish to survive the liberty of my country one single moment, and am determined to risk my all in supporting it.\" Thus the voice of Virginia, within and without the Convention, was for Liberty, and she sent Patrick Henry, Washington, Richard Henry Lee, and Peyton Randolph to expound her views in the Continental Congress, which met at Philadelphia, September 4, 1774. Peyton Randolph, late Speaker of the Assembly of Virginia, was unanimously chosen President of the first Continental Congress. The assemblage baptized itself \" The Congress,\" and its Chairman \" The President.\" Eleven Colonies were represented by fifty-five members, each Colony sending as many members as it pleased, and here Patrick Henry, Washington, Richard Henry Lee, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Jay, and many other noble patriots met to face the desperate resort of Revolution. At the beginning of the second day's session, a long and deep silence prevailed. The voice of Virginia was waited for, and soon it was heard to break that momentous stillness. Amid the solemn hush rose Patrick Henry to speak his country's wrongs, and to grave as \"with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever,\" the glorious idea of American union. \"British oppression,\" he said, \"has effaced the boundaries of the several Colonies ; the distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, and New Eng landers are no more. I am not a Virginian, but an Amer ican ! \" In 1774 the number of white inhabitants in all the thirteen Colonies was about 2,100,000, and of blacks about 500,000. This was the America which determined to be free. But, before the patient patriots in Congress assembled turned to the last resort, they determined to make one final appeal to England. They sent an address to the King, a memorial' to"], [238, "THE GOVERNORS OF V/RG/N/A. 204 the people of British America, and an address to the people of Great Britain. Mr. Lee, Mr. J. Adams, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Henry, and Mr. Randolph prepared the address to the King ; Mr. Lee wrote the memorial to the people of British America ; and Mr. Jay, the address to the people of Great Britain. Lord Chatham, in speaking of these communications in the House of Lords, said: \"When your lordships look at the papers transmitted to us from America, when you con sider their decency, firmness, and wisdom, you cannot but respect their cause and wish to make it your own. For myself, I must declare and avow that in all my reading and observation \u2014 and state-craft has been my favorite study, I have read Thucydides, and admired the master states of the world \u2014 that for solidity of reasoning, force of sagacity, and wisdom of conclusion under such complication of circum stances, no nation or body of men can stand in preference to the general Congress at Philadelphia.\" It is true that the Congress of 1774 was composed of men of the highest order of wisdom and talent, \" but, if you speak of solid information and sound judgment,\" said Patrick Henry, \" Washington is unquestionably the greatest man of them all.\" But England would not relent, and the pressure of events which thickened as the time rolled on, found Virginia in 1775 embarrassed by unusual difficulties. Subjected to the tyranny of a Governor now opposed to her every interest, and, saving a little powder in a magazine near Williamsburg, destitute of warlike stores, she was, with many hindrances, quite unprepared for war. Of all the Colonies, she was most open to attack. The Bay of the Chesapeake, the deep waters of the Potomac, the James, the York, and other streams, exposed her to invasion, and when day after day she saw the English men-of-war hovering upon her coast, she knew \"the hour \" had come, and she bared her bosom to the storm. To meet the crisis, she called a convention to assemble at Rich mond in March of this year, 1775. Williamsburg was no longer a place for revolutionary assemblages. Dunmore sat in his palace and watched in angry silence the progress of events, relying for his own protection on the British men-of-"], [239, "PE YTON RANDOLPH. 205 war lying in the river near at hand. So the patriots con vened, March 20, 1775, in Richmond, on what is now known as \"Church Hill,\" in old St. John's Church, there to make ready for the morrow. They knew their cause was just, and they knew that whatever course might be decided on for the defence of Virginia, the people at home were ready to lay down their money and their lives to accomplish it. Of this Convention Peyton Randolph was chosen President, and here Patrick Henry delivered one of those stirring, fiery appeals of eloquence which has in part come down to us. He said, addressing the President : \" I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British Ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the house. Is it that insidious srrrile with which our petition has beerr lately received ? Trust it not, sir ; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suf fer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies neces sary to a work of love and reconciliation ? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled, that force must be called in to win back our love ? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and sub jugation ; the last argument to which kings resort. I ask, gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submis sion? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain an enemy in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumu lation of navies and armies ? No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us ; they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains, which the British Ministry have been so long forg ing. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable ; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find, which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves longer. \"Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on.

In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free\u2014 if we mean to preserve invio late those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contend ing\u2014if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so lotrg engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon, until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained\u2014 we must fight!

Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delu sive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. Three millions of people, armed irr the holy cause of Liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which oirr enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God, who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone ; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat, but in submission and slavery. Our chains are forged. Their clanking may be heard upon the plains of Boston. The war is inevitable, \u2014 and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come! It is vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, 'Peace, peace! ' but there is no peace. The war is actually begun. The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms ! Our brethren are already in the field. Why stand we here idle ? What is it that the gentlemen wish ? What would you have ? Is life so dear or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but, as for me, give me liberty, or give me death ! \" Says William Wirt in describing this scene: \"He took his seat. No murmur of applause was heard. The effect was too deep. After the trance of a moment, several mem bers started from their seats. The cry, ' To arms !

Indeed, they had nothing to support them in the awful contest but their own virtue and talents, and a firm reliance on the Sovereign Disposer of all events.\" The progress of the Revolution shows with what facility all diffi culties were surmounted, what rapid progress was made in military science, and how fitly every measure was adapted to the circumstances of the country. Thus was Virginia fairly launched into the War of the Revolution. Meeting at her own door the treacherous Lord Dunmore, who, by fire, sword, and every wicked strategem, sought her ruin, she failed not to join hands with her sister Colonies, to work out their common redemption. In this exciting posture of affairs the Colonial Convention of Virginia met again in Richmond, on Monday, the 17th day of July, 1775. Peyton Randolph was chosen President of this Convention, whose proceedings were marked by great decision and vigor. Their first measure was ' ' An ordinance for raising and embodying a sufficient force for the defence and protection of this Colony.\" Two regiments of regulars, to consist of one thousand and twenty privates, rank and file, were to be forthwith raised and taken into the pay of the Colony ; also other military forces were provided for, and soldiers armed, trained, and furnished with all military accoutrements, were to be ready to march at a minute's warning.

The burning period now to be reviewed is known in the annals of Virginia as the \"Interregnum,\" being the time embraced from the dissolution of the regal government, prac tically dissolved upon the flight of Lord Dunmore, June 6, 1775, until the establishment of the Commonwealth on the 29th June, 1776. Edmund Pendleton, whose name heads this article, was born in the County of Caroline, Va., in 1712, and on his estate, \" Edmundsbury,\" in that county, spent such portion of his life as was not devoted to public service. He became first, Clerk of the County Court, then a member of the bar, and at the age of thirty entered the House of Burgesses of Virginia.

He was for a long time one of the leading members of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, and in 1773 was appointed one of the Committee of Corre spondence for gaining intelligence of the acts of the British government, and for communicating with the Colonies.

In 1789 he was appointed Judge of the United States District Court for Virginia, but declined the office. He was for many years a Judge of the Court of Appeals of Virginia, and its President at the time of his death, which took place at Richmond, 23d October, 1806. He held the first rank as a lawyer and statesman, and was particularly distinguished for the force and clearness of his thoughts, for subtlety in discrimination, and dexterity in argument. Edmund Pendleton is thus described by the celebrated William Wirt, of Richmond, Va.: \"His manners were elevated, graceful and insinuating. His person was spare, but well proportioned ; and his countenance one of the finest in the world; serene \u2014 contemplative \u2014 benignant \u2014 with that expression of unclouded intelligence and extensive reach, which seemed to denote hirrr capable of anything that could be effected by the power of the hunran mind.

As a lawyer and a statesman he had few equals; no superiors. For parliamentary management, he was without a rival. With all these advantages of person, manners, address and intellect, he was also a speaker of distinguished enrineuce. He had that silver voice of which Cicero makes such frequent and honorable nrention \u2014 an articula tion uncommonly distinct \u2014 a perennial stream of transparent, cool and sweet elocutiou ; and the power of presenting his arguments with great sinrplicity, and striking effect. He was always graceful, argumentative, persuasive, never vehement, rapid, or abrupt. He could instruct aud delight ; but he had no pretensions to those high powers which are calcu lated to ' shake the human soul.' \" Pendleton has also been described as the conservatist revolutionist of the era, saying of himself, that his great aim was to \"raise the spirits of the timid to a general united opposition , ' ' and oppose ' ' the violent who were for plunging us into rash measures.\" Surely none better suited to the high and responsible position could have been chosen to preside over the Convention of Virginia, in December, 1775. This Convention was \"held at the Town of Richmond, in the Colony of Virginia, on Friday, the first of December, in the"], [245, "EDMl WD PENDLETON. 211 year of our Lord one thousand and seven hundred and seventy-five, and afterwards, by adjournment, in the City of Williamsburg.\" Its proceedings were such as the urgency of the times demanded. But no one can appreciate the perils and difficulties of those days, without realizing that the rep resentatives of the people of Virginia were endowed ' ' with wisdom from on high.\" Indeed, they had formerly declared their dependence upon the God of Hosts, (see the declaration of the Convention in their Journal of the 13th December, 1775, ) and had lifted their arms in the name of \" One mighty to save.\" The first Ordinance enacted was ' ' for raising an additional number of forces for the defence and protection of this Colony,\" and for otherwise perfecting their military system ; next, \"An Ordinance for appointing Sheriffs\"; next, \"An Ordinance for providing arms and ammunition for the use of this Colony \" ; next, \" An Ordinance for revising and amend ing an Ordinance appointing a Committee of Safety ' ' ; and then, after making wise regulations concerning some matters of domestic policy, they passed a comprehensive \"Ordinance for establishing a mode of punishment for the enemies to America in this Colony.\" On the 19th day of April, 1775, the first blood of the Revolution was shed on the plains of Lexington, in Massa chusetts. Eight Americans were killed. This battle was the signal of war, and not until Old Yorktown, Virginia, had wit nessed the capitulation of Lord Cornwallis to General Wash ington, on October 19, 1781, did the storm of conflict abate. In May, 1776, Virginia again assembled in Convention in Richmond, and the history of this momentous occasion cannot by another pen be so well described as by the accom plished historian, Bancroft, in the following : \"On the sixth of May, forty-five members of the House of Burgesses of Virginia nret at the capital in Williamsburg pursuant to their adjourn ment ; but, as they were of the opinion that the ancient Constitution had been subverted by the King and Parliament of Great Britain, they dis solved themselves unanimously, and thus the last vestige of the King's authority passed away."], [246, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 212 \"The delegates of Virginia, who on the same morning assembled in convention not less than one hundred and thirty in number, were a con stituent and an executive assembly. They represented the oldest and the largest Colony, whose institutions had been fashioned on the model recom mended by Bacon, and whose inhabitants for nearly a hundred and sev enty years had been eminently loyal, and had sustained the Church of England as the Establishment of the land. ' ' Its people, having in their origin a perceptible but never an exclu sive influence of the Cavaliers, had sprung mainly from Adventurers, who were not fugitives for conscience' sake, or sufferers from persecution, or passionate partisans of monarchy. The population had been recruited by successive infusions of Scotch-Irish Presbyterians; Huguenots, and the descendants of Huguenots ; men who had been so attached to Cromwell or to the republic that they preferred to emigrate on the return of Charles II.; Baptists and other dissenters ; and in the valley of Virginia there was a very large German population. Beside all these, there was the great body of the backwoodsmen, rovers from Maryland and Pennsylvania, not caring much for the record of their lineage. \"The territory for which the convention was to act was not a limited one like that of Sparta or Attica; beginning at the ocean, it comprised the great Bay of the Chesapeake, with its central and southern tributaries ; the beautiful valleys on the head-springs of the Roanoke and along the whole course of the Shenandoah ; the country beyond the mountains, including the sources of the Monongahela and the Cumberland Rivers, and extending indefinitely to the Tennessee and beyond it. Nor that only; Virginia insisted that its jurisdiction stretched without bounds over all the country west and northwest of a line two hundred miles north of Old Point Comfort, not granted to others by royal charters; and there was no one to dispute a large part of this claim except the Province of Quebec under an Act of Parliament which the Continental Congress had annulled. For all this wide expanse, rich in soil, precious minerals, heal ing springs, forests, convenient marts for foreign commerce, the great pathways to the west, more fertile, more spaciovrs than all Greece, Italy and Great Britain, than any region for which it had ever been proposed to establish republican liberty, a Constitution was to be framed. \"It has been discussed, whether the spirit that now prevailed was derived from Cavaliers, and whether it sprung from the inhabitants on tide water or was due to those of the uplands ; the answer is plain : the movement in Virginia proceeded from the heart of Virginia herself, and represented the magnanimity of her own people. It did not spring, it could not spring, from sentiments generated by the by-gone loyalty to the Stuarts. The Ancient Donrinion had with entire unanimity approved the change of dynasty of 168S ; with equal unanimity, had, even more readily than the English, accepted the House of Hanover, and had beeu one of the most loyal parts of the empire of the Georges ; the Revolution was due"], [247, "EDMUND PENDLETON. 213 to a keen sentiment of wrong and outrage, and was joined in with a one ness of spirit, which asked no questions about ancestrv, or traditional affinities, or religious creed, or nearness to the sea or to the mountains. The story of the war commemorates the courage of the men of the inte rior ; among the ' ' inexorable families ' ' Dunmore especially reported from the low country the Lees, and the whole family of Cary of Hampton, of whom even the sisters, married to a Fairfax and a Nicholas, cheered on their connections to unrelenting opposition. Virginia rose with as much unanimity as Connecticut or Massachusetts, arrd with a nrorc command ing resolution. \"The purpose for which the convention was assembled appears fronr the words of the county of Buckingham to Charles Patterson aud John Cabell, its Delegates: 'We instruct you to cause a total and final separa tion from Great Britain to take place as sooir as possible ; and a Constitu tion to be established, with a full representation, and free and frequent elections. As America is the last country of the wTorld which has con tended for her liberty, so she may be the most free and happy ; taking advantage of her situation and strength, and having the experience of all before to profit by. The Supreme Being hath left it in our power to choose what government we please for our civil and religious happiness ; good government and the prosperity of mankind can alone be in the divine intention ; we pray therefore that, uuder the superintending provi dence of the Ruler of the universe, a government may be established in Arrrerica, the most free, happy, and permanent that human wisdom carr contrive and the perfection of nran maintain. ' \" The county of Augusta represented the necessity of making the con federacy of the united Colonies most perfect, independent, and lasting; and of framing an equal, free and liberal government, that rrright bear the test of all future ages. A petition was sent fronr the inhabitants of Tran sylvania, declaring that they were anxious to concur with their brethren of the united Colonies in every measure for the recovery of their rights and liberties. ' ' The inhabitants on the rivers Watauga and Holston set forth that ' they were deeply impressed with a sense of the distresses of their Ameri can brethren, and would, when called upon, with their lives and fortunes, lend them every assistance in their power ; that they, begged to be consid ered as a part of the Colony, and would readily embrace every opportun ity of obeying any commands from the convention.' \"To that body were chosen more than one hundred aird thirty of the ablest and most weighty men of Virginia. Among thenr were no rash enthusiasts for liberty ; no lovers of revolution for the sake of change ; no ambitious demagogues hoping for advancement by the overthrow of exist ing institutions ; they were the choice of the freeholders of Virginia, and the majority were men of independent fortune, or even opulence. It was afterwards remembered that of this grave Assembly the members were for"], [248, "214 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. the most part men of large stature and robust frames, and that a very great proportion of them lived to exceeding old age. They were now to decide whether Virginia demanded independence, and if so, they were to estab lish a Commonwealth ; in irraking this decisiorr, they moved like a pillar of fire in front of the whole country. \"When the delegates had assembled and appointed a clerk, Richard Bland recommended Edmund Pendleton to be chosen President, and was seconded bv Archibald Cary ; while Thomes Johnson of Louisa, and Bar tholomew Dandridge, proposed Thomas Ludwell Lee. For a moment there was something like an array of parties, but it instantly subsided; Virginia showed her greatness by her nroderation, and gave to the world new evidence that the Revolution sprung from necessity, by placing irr the chair Pendleton, the most cautious and conservative among her patriots. After his election, he wrote to a friend : ' Of all others, I own I prefer the the true English Constitution, which consists of a proper combiuation of the principles of honor, virtue, and fear.' \"The Convention, after having been employed for some days on cur rent business, resolved itself into a committee of the whole on the state of the Colony ; and on the fifteenth Archibald Cary reported resolutions which had been drafted by Pendleton, offered by Nelson, and enforced by Henry. They were then twice read at the Clerk's table, and, one hundred and twelve members being present, were unanimously agreed to. The preanrble enumerated their chief grievances ; among others, that the King's representative in the Colony was training and employing slaves against their masters ; and, they say : ' We have no alternative left but au abject submission or a total separation '; therefore, they went on to decree, ' that their delegates in Congress be instructed to propose to that body to declare the uirited Colonies free and independent states, absolved froru all allegiance or dependence upon the Crown or Parliarrrent of Great Britain ; and that they give the assent of this Colony to such declaration, and to trreasures for forming foreign alliances and a Confederation of the Colonies ; provided that the power of forming government for, and the regulation of the internal concerns of each Colony, be left to the respective colonial Leg islatures. \"This resolution was received out of doors with chirrres of bells and the noise of artillery ; and the British flag, which had thus far kept its place on the statehouse, was struck, to be raised no more. \"In the following days, a committee of thirty-two was appointed to prepare a declaration of rights and a plan of government. Among the members were Archibald Cary ; Patrick Henry, first of all in boldly main taining the spirit of the resolution and influence over the members front the upper counties; the aged Richard Bland; Edmund Randolph, son of the attorney-general, who was theu a refugee in England; Nicholas; James Madison, the youthful delegate from Orange county ; but the one who at that moment held most sway over the mind of the convention was"], [249, "EDMUND PENDLETON. 215 George Mason, the successor of Washington in the representation of Fair fax county. He was a devoted member of the Church of England; and by his own account of himself, which is still preserved, 'though not born withiu the verge of the British isle, he had been an Englishman in his principles, a zealous assertor of the Act of Settlerrrent, firmlv attached to the royal family upon the throne, well affected to the King personally and to his government, in defence of which he would have shed the last drop of his blood ; one who adored the wisdom and happiness of the British Constitution, and preferred it to any that then existed or had ever existed.' For ten years he claimed nothing for his countrymen beyond the liberty and privileges of Englishmen , in the same degree as if they had still con tinued among their brethren in Great Britain ; but he said : ' The ancient poets, in their elegant manner of expression, have made a kind of being of Necessity, and tell us that the gods themselves are obliged to yield to her ' ; and he left the private life that he loved, to assist in the rescue of his country from the excesses of arbitrary power to which a seeming fatal ity had driven the British Ministers. He was a good speaker and an able debater, the more eloquent now for being touched with sorrow ; but his great strength lay in his sincerity, which made him wise and bold, modest and unchanging, while it overawed his hearers. He was severe, but his severity was humane, with no tinge of bitterness, though he had a scorn for everything mean, cowardly, or low ; and he always spoke out his con victions with frank directness. He had been truly loyal ; on renouncing his King, he could stand justified to his own conscience only by an unself ish attachment to human freedom. \"On the twenty-seventh of May, Cary, from the committee, pre sented to the Convention the Declaration of Rights which Mason had drafted. For the next fortnight the great truths which it proclaimed, and which were to form the groundwork of American institutions, employed the thoughts of the Convention, and during several successive days were the subject of solemn deliberation. One clause only received a material amendment. Mason had written that all should enjoy the fullest tolera tion in the exercise of religion. But toleration is the demand of the skep tic, who has no fixed belief, and only wishes to be let alone ; a firm faith, which is too easily tempted to establish itself exclusively, can be content with nothing less than equality. A young man, then unknown to fame, of a bright hazel eye inclining to gray, small in stature, light in person, delicate in appearance, looking like a pallid, sickly scholar among the robust men with whom he was associated, proposed an amendment. He was James Madison, the son of an Orange county planter, bred in the school of Presbyterian dissenters under Witherspoon at Princeton , trained by his own studies, by meditative rural life in the Old Dominion, by an ingenuous indignation at the persecutions of the Baptists, by the innate principles of right, to uphold the sanctity of religious freedom. He objected to the word \"toleration,\" because it implied an established"], [250, "216 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. religion, which endured dissent only as a condescension ; and, as the earnestness of his convictions overcame his modesty, he went on to dem onstrate that ' all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion , according to the dictates of conscience. ' His motion, which did but state with better dialectics the very purpose which Mason wished to accom plish, obtained the suffrages of his colleagues. \"A DECLARATION OF RIGHTS MADE BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOOD PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA, ASSEMBLED IN FULL AND FREE CONVENTION ; WHICH RIGHTS DO PERTAIN TO THEM, AND THEIR POSTERITY AS THE BASIS AND FOUNDATION OF GOVERNMENT.

She summoned the eternal laws of man's being to pro test against all tyranny. The English petitiorr of right in 1688 was his toric and retrospective ; the Virginia declaration canre out of the heart of nature, and announced governing principles for all peoples in all future times. It was the voice of reason going forth to speak a new political world into being. At the bar of humanity Virginia gave the name and fame of her sons as hostages that her public life should show a likeness to the highest ideas of right and equal freedom among men.\" Thus beautifully does Bancroft describe that ever-to-be remembered Convention, which gave to the human race the Bill of Rights. On the 29th June, 1776, a Constitution or form of govern ment was unanimously adopted by this Convention, and Patrick Henry, the people's idol, immediately elected first Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, with Edmund Randolph as Attorney-General. A short time before, on the 7th of June, 1776, Richard Henry Lee had moved in Congress, ' ' That these united Colonies are and ought to be free and independent states, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved.\" John Adams seconded the motion. After ani mated debate, a committee was appointed to draw up the \"Declaration.\" Richard Henry Lee having been called away to Virginia by illness in his family, the position which belonged to him (as by courtesy, chairman of this com mittee,) was conferred on Thomas Jefferson. He accordingly drew up the paper, and on July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress. Among the contributions of Virginia to the cause of Amer ica up to this juncture may be noted : The Resolutions of 1765, denouncing the Stamp Act ; The originating in 1773 the Committees of Correspondence, which first united the Colonies ;"], [253, "EDMUND PEN/)/. ETON. 219 The call in 1774, by her Convention, for a General Con gress ; The instructions, by the Convention of May, 1776, to the Virginia delegates, to propose a Declaration of Independence, which Richard Henry Lee moved in Congress, which Thomas Jefferson wrote, and which Washington was by his sword to lay broad and deep as the corner-stone of Republican liberty."], [254, "LXX PATRICK HENRY. Governor. June 29, 1776, to June 1, 1779- Patrick Henry, the second son of John and Sarah Henry, and one of nine children, was born on the 29th of May, 1736, at the family seat, called \" Studley,\" in the County of Hanover and Colony of Virginia. In his early childhood his parents removed to another seat in the same county, then called \"Mount Brilliant,\" now, \"The Retreat.\" At this last place Patrick Henry was raised and educated. His parents, though not rich, were in easy circumstances, and in point of personal character were among the most respectable inhabitants of the Colony. Patrick Henry was sent first to an \" old field school, ' ' where, at that period, tuition was chiefly confined to the primary departments of learning. Under his father he acquired a competent English education and some acquaintance with Latin and mathematics. As a boy, he was fond of hunting and angling, and would desert his books at any moment for these pleasures, loving, at that time, such amusements far better than any serious employment. Merchandise and agriculture, and merchandise again, he tried in turn without success, until about 1759, when at the age of twenty-four he embraced the study of law. This was the turning point in his life. Having when eighteen years old married Miss Sarah Shelton, of Hanover County, Virginia, it well behooved him to make some decided advance in life. He had met with disap pointments, and the past was marked with failures, but this stage of Patrick Henry's experience was the deep darkness just before the dawn. At last he had found the path for which he was designed, and now, with him ' ' old things are passed away ;"], [255, "THE HEART OF THE REBELLION, Old Capitol, Williamsburg, Va."], [256, ""], [257, "I'ATRICK HENRY. 221 behold, all things are become new.\" A new heaven and a new earth spread before him, and henceforth hitherto unseen constellations were to guide the future statesman. It has been said that from the beginning of his career as a lawyer, Mr. Henry's practice was extensive ; it has been frequently asserted on the other hand, that he was not distinguished at the bar for three years after he adopted his interesting pro fession. Be these facts as they may, it is recorded history that Patrick Henry's first great impression upon the public was on the first of December, 1763, in the trial at Hanover Court House, of \" The Parson's Cause.\" In this celebrated case the clergy were arrayed against the people, and the contest was a bitter one. The clergy were entitled by law to 16,000 pounds of tobacco per annum, each, and the Acts of the House of Burgesses, in 1755 and 1758, curtailed very sensibly their revenue. Owing to the failure in these years of the tobacco crop, these Acts provide that \"all persons from whom any tobacco was due, were authorized to pay the same, either in tobacco or in money, after the rate of sixteen shillings and eight pence per hundred, at the option of the debtor.\" These Acts were to continue, severally, for ten months and no longer. The law was universal in its appli cation, but bore specially on the clergy of the Established Church. They resolved to bring the question to a judicial test, and suits were accordingly brought by them, in the various County Courts of the Colony, to recover their stipends in the specific, tobacco. They selected the County of Han over as the place of the first experiment. The case went against the defendants, and Mr. John Lewis, their attorney, convinced that nothing more could be done, retired from the cause. In this desperate situation Mr. Lewis's clients applied to Patrick Henry, and he undertook to argue the case for them before a jury at the ensuing term of Court. Mr. William Wirt, of Richmond, Va., the accomplished biographer of Patrick Henry, gives a soul-stirring account of this scene ; he says : \"He rose very awkwardly, and faltered much in his exordium. The"], [258, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGIN/ A. 222 people hung their heads at so unpromising a commencement ; the clergy were observed to exchange sly looks with each other ; and his father is described as having almost sunk with confusion fronr his seat. But, these feelings were of short duration and soon gave place to others of a very different character. For, now were those wonderful faculties which he possessed, for the first time developed ; and now was first witnessed that mysterious and almost supernatural transformation of appearance which the fire of his own eloquence never sailed to work in him. His atti tude, by degrees, became erect and lofty. The spirit of his genius awakened all his features. His countenance shone with a nobleness and grandeur which it had never before exhibited. There was a lightning in his eyes which seemed to rive the spectator. His action became graceful, bold, and commanding, and in the tones of his voice, but more especially in his emphasis, there was a peculiar charm, a magic of which any one who ever heard him will speak as soon as he is named, but of which no one can give any adequate description. They can only say that it struck upon the ear and upon the heart in a manner which language cannot tell. Add to all these his wonder-working fancy, and the peculiar phraseology in which he clothed its images ; for he painted to the heart with a force that almost petrified it. It will not be difficult for any one who ever heard this most extraordinary nran to believe the whole account of this transaction which is given by his surviving hearers ; and from their account the Court House of Hanover County must have exhib ited on this occasion a scene as picturesque as has been ever witnessed in real life. \"In less than twenty minutes the people might be seen in every part of the house, on every bench, in every window, stoopitrg forward from their stands ip death-like silence, their features fixed in amazement and awe, all their senses listening and riveted upon the speaker, as if to catch the last strain of some heavenly visitant. The mockery of the clergy soon turned into alarm ; their triumph, into confusion and despair . and at one burst of his rapid and overwhelming invective, they fled from the bench in precipitation and terror. As for his father, such was his surprise, such his amazement, such his rapture, that, forgetting where he was and the character which he was filling, tears of ecstacy streamed down his cheeks, without the power or inclination to repress them.\" Such is William Wirt's vivid picture of that Court House scene, the sequel to which is so well known. The jury had scarcely left the bar, when they returned with a verdict of one penny damages ; a motion for a new trial was overruled, and amidst the redoubled acclamations of the people, this forest-born Demosthenes was borne upon their shoulders out"], [259, "PATRICK HENRY. 223 of the Court House and around the green. In that brief hour he had taken captive the heart of Virginia, and had burst upon the public gaze like Minerva from the brain of Jove, in full armor and with a mighty war shout. Hence forth he was to go forth conquering and to conquer. In 1764, Mr. Henry removed from Hanover to the County of Louisa, and resided at a place called \"The Roundabout.\" It was in the fall of this year that he had an opportunity of distinguishing himself upon a new theatre. A contest occurred in the House of Burgesses in the case of Mr. James Littlepage, the returned member for the County of Hanover. The rival candidate and petitioner was Na thaniel West Dandridge. The charge against Mr. Little page was bribery and corruption. The parties were heard by their counsel, before the committee on Privileges and Elections, and Mr. Henry was on this occasion employed by Mr. Dandridge. He here struck amazement into the com mittee by his eloquence and brilliant display on the great subject of the rights of suffrage \" superior to anything that had been heard before within those walls.\" On the 1st of May, 1765, Mr. Henry entered the House of Burgesses as the representative from Louisa County, and by some resolutions which he introduced in reference to The Stamp Act, obtained the honor of being the first to inaugurate open opposition to the oppressive measures of the British Crown. This opposition was doomed to result in a bloody struggle, but through crimson fields of revolution the desperate patriots marched to victory and blood-bought independence. In 1767, Mr. Henry removed from Louisa to his native county, Han over, but was continued a member of the House of Burgesses. In 1769, he was admitted to the Bar of the General Court, and rose to distinguished prominence in his profession. But, events were hurrying on a mighty conflict between the mother country and the Colonies, and soon Patrick Henry was to display his complex genius upon a wider field of action. He was to become the ardent, imposing, dazzling orator of the Revolution, moving men not only by that irresistible eloquence which took them captive, but"], [260, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRG/N/A. 224 also leading them whither he would, by a nerve and resolution which was indomitable. Much has already, in other articles in this work, been said of Patrick Henry's eloquence and zeal in the Virginia Conven tions of 1774, 1775, and 1776 ; also of his brilliant appeals in the Continental Congress of 1774 and of 1775. In this last year, 1775, he lost the wife of his youth, who had shared the changing fortunes of his early life. Soon after, he sold the farm in Hanover called \" Scotch Town,\" on which he had resided, and purchased about ten thousand acres of land in Henry County. This county was formed in 1776 from Pittsylvania County, and named in his honor, as was subsequently the neighboring county of Patrick, carved from Henry County in 1 79 1. His estate in Henry County was known as \" Leatherwood.\" In April, 1775, Lord Dunmore, Governor of the Colony of Virginia, removed secretly all the powder from the magazine at Williamsburg, to a sloop of war lying in the York River. This step naturally aroused the deepest feelings of resentment among the people, and Patrick Henry, stepping to the front, placed himself at the head of the company of Captain Sam uel Meredith (who resigned in his favor), of Hanover County, and marched upon Williamsburg. The effect of this movement was like magic. Companies started up on all sides, and it is said that five thousand men, at least, were in arms and crossing the country to crowd around Henry's stand ard and support it with their lives. The march was conducted with the greatest regard for private rights, and in perfect order. But, this advance meant an appeal to Heaven, that last resort when there can be no judge on earth. This crisis Pat rick Henry saw, although the patriots in Williamsburg were not prepared to grasp the situation. Messenger after messen ger was sent to meet Captain Henry and beg him to desist and discharge his men. In vain ; he had resolved to effect his pur pose or perish in the attempt. Dunmore, alarmed at his war like advance, sent out to meet him, and paid a satisfactory equivalent of .\u00a3330 for the powder. Lord Dunmore, in conse quence of these proceedings, issued a proclamation denouncing"], [261, "PATRICK HENRY. 225 \" a certain Patrick Henry, of the County of Hanover, and a number of deluded followers\"; but, his threats were useless, and this brave man by this brave act became enthroned more permanently in the hearts of his people. In June, 1775, Mr. Henry was appointed Colonel of the First Virginia Regiment, and Commander-in-Chief of all the forces of the Colony. He at once went into camp at Williamsburg and ardently began recruiting and disciplin ing the troops. Lord Dunmore (having fled from Wil liamsburg) was at this time ravaging the shores of the Chesapeake and threatening Norfolk, and the Committee of Safety was compelled to take prompt action. Colonel Wil liam Woodford, of the Second Virginia Regiment, was de tached at the head of a greater portion of the forces against the enemy, and with his few, raw, Virginia recruits drove back the best trained English soldiers and gained a brilliant victory at the battle of Great Bridge. The action of the Committee of Safety in selecting Woodford (who had distin guished himself in the French and Indian war) to command this expedition was in consequence of his military experience. But this promotion of Woodford over Colonel Henry, and later, the advancement in the continental line to the rank of Brigadier-General of two Colonels, to whose appointments his own was prior, so wounded Henry's spirit that he resigned his commission. Public feeling rose high in sympathy with him, and his resignation nearly produced a mutiny in the Army. But though adverse influences were at work against Henry's career as a soldier, the Committee of Safety and Congress had \" builded better\" than they knew. Guided by The Hand into whose keeping they had committed their destinies, they were setting aside from the perils of war, one, who in the conduct of the Revolution, they could not spare from their councils. That clarion voice must not be hushed in the wild din of battle ; that leader of men's thoughts must not be given to the mercy of the sword ! The following is the notice of Colonel Henry's resignation, in Purdie's paper, of March 1, 1776 : \"Vesterday morning the troops in this city (Williamsburg) being"], [262, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 226 informed that Patrick Henry, Esquire, Commander-in-Chief of the Vir ginia forces, was about to leave thenr, the whole went iirto deep mourning, and, being under arms, waited orr hinr at his lodgings, where they addressed him in the following manner,\" etc., etc. Immediately after resigning his commission as Colonel, and withdrawing from the immediate concerns of war, Pat rick Henry was elected delegate from Hanover County to the Convention which was to meet May 6, 1776, at Williamsburg. On the 12th of June, in this Convention, was adopted the \" Bill of Rights,\" and on the 29th of the same month, \"The Constitution, or Form of Government,\" was unanimously adopted by Virginia. These two celebrated papers were prepared by George Mason, of Virginia, and stand a permanent monument to his patriotism and ability. THE CONSTITUTION OR FORM OF GOVERNMENT AGREED TO AND RESOLVED UPON BY THE DELEGATES AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SEVERAL COUNTIES AND CORPORATIONS OF VIRGINIA. (Unanimously adopted, June 29, 1776.) I. Whereas George the third, King of Great Britain and Ireland, and elector of Hanover, heretofore intrusted with the exercise of kingly office in this government, hath endeavoured to prevert the same into a detesta ble atrd insupportable tyranny, by putting his negative on laws the most wholesome and necessary for the publick good : By denying his governours permission to post laws of immediate aud pressing importance, unless suspended irr their operation for his assent, and, when so suspended, neglecting to attend to them for many years: By refusing to pass certain other laws, unless the persons to be bene fitted by them would relinquish the inestimable right of representatiotr in the legislature : By dissolving legislative Assemblies repeatedly and continually, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions of the lights of the people: When dissolved, by refusing to call others for a long space of time, thereby leaving the political system without any legislative head: By endeavouring to prevent the population ol our country, and for that purpose, obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners : By keeping amougus, in timesofpeace, standing armies and shipsof war :"], [263, "PATRICK HENRY. 227 By affecting to render the military independent of, and superiour to, the civil power : By combining with others to subject us to a foreigu jurisdiction, giv ing his assent to their pretended acts of legislation : For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us : For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world : For imposing taxes on us without our consent : For depriving us of the benefits of trial by jury : For transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended offences : For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever: By plundering our seas, ravaging our coasts, burning our towns, and destroying the lives of our people : By inciting insurrections of our fellow-subjects, with the allurements of forfeiture and confiscation : By pronrpting our negroes to rise in arms among us, those very negroes whom, by an inhuman use of his negative, he hath refused us per mission to exclude by law : By endeavouring to bring otr the inhabitants of our frontiers the mer ciless Indian savages, whose krrown rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, aud conditions of existence : By transporting, at this time, a large army of foreign mercenaries, to complete the works of death, desolation, aud tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy unworthy the head of a civilized na tion: By answering our repeated petitions for redress with a repetition of injuries : And, finally, by abandoning the helm of government, and declaring us out of his allegiance arrd protection. By which several acts of misrule, the government of this country, as formerly exercised under the crown of Great Britain, is TOTALLY DIS SOLVED. II. We therefore, the delegates arrd representatives of the good people of Virginia, having maturely considered the premises, and viewing with great concern the deplorable condition to which this once happy country must be reduced, unless some regular, adequate mode of civil polity is speedily adopted, and in conrpliance with a recommendation of the Gen eral Congress, do ordain and declare the future fornr of government of Vir ginia to be as followeth : III. The legislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct, so that neither exercise the powers properly belong ing to the other ; nor shall any person exercise the powers of rrrore than one of them at the same time, except that the justices of the county courts shall be eligible to either House of Assembly. IV. The legislative shall be forrrred of two distinct branches, who, together, shall be a complete legislature. They shall meet once, or oftener,"], [264, "228 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. every year, and shall be called the General Assembly of Virginia. V. One of these shall be called the House of Delegates, and consist of two representatives to be chosen for each county, and for the district of West Augusta, annually, of such men as actually reside in and are free holders of the same, or duly qualified according to law, and also one dele gate or representative to be chosen annually for the city of Williamsburg, and one for the borough of Norfolk, and a representative for each of such other cities and boroughs as may hereafter be allowed particular representa tion by the legislature ; but when any city or borough shall so decrease as that the number of persons having right of suffrage therein shall have been for the space of seven years successively less than half the number of voters in some one county in Virginia, such city or borough thenceforward shall cease to send a delegate or representative to the assembly. VI. The other shall be called the Senate, and consist of twenty-four members, of whom thirteen shall constitute a House to proceed on business, for whose electiorr the different counties shall be divided into twenty-four districts, and each county of the respective district, at the time of the elec tion of its delegates, shall vote for one Senator, who is actually a resident and freeholder within the district, or duly qualified according to law, and is trpwards of twenty-five years of age ; and the sheriffs of each county within five days at farthest after the last county electiorr irr the district, shall meet at some convenient place, and frorrr the poll so taken in their respective counties return as a Senator the man who shall have the great est number of votes in the whole district. To keep up this Assembly by rotation, the districts shall be equally divided into four classes, and num bered by lot. At the end of one year after the general electiorr, the six mem bers elected by the first division shall be displaced, and the vacancies thereby occasioned supplied from such class or division, by new election, in the manner aforesaid. This rotation shall be applied to each division, accord ing to its number, and continued in due order annually. VII. The right of suffrage in the election of members for both Houses shall remain as exercised at present, and each House shall choi.se its own speaker, appoint its own officers, settle its own rules of proceeding, and direct writs of election for supplying intermediate vacancies. VIII. All laws originate in the House of Delegates, to be approved or rejected by the Senate, or to be amended with the consent of the House of Delegates; except money bills, which in no instance shall be altered by the Senate, but wholly approved or rejected. IX. A Governour, or chief magistrate, shall be choseir annually, by joint ballot of both Houses, to be taken in each house respectively, depos ited in the conference room, the boxes examined jointly by a conrmitec of each house, and the numbers severally reported to them, that the appoint ments may be entered, (which shall be the mode of taking the joint ballot of both Houses in all cases) who shall not continue in that office longer than three years successively, nor lie eligible until the expiration of four"], [265, "PATRICK HENRY. 229 years after he shall have been out of that office. Arr adequate, but mod erate salary, shall be settled on him during his continuance in office ; and he shall, with advice of a Council of State, exercise the executive powers of government according to the laws of this commonwealth ; and shall not, under any pretence, exercise any power or prerogative by virtue of any law, statute, or custom, of ENGLAND : But he shall, with the advice of the Council of State, have the power of granting reprieves or pardons, except where prosecution shall have been carried on by the House of Del egates, or the law shall otherwise particularly direct ; in which cases, no reprieve or pardon shall be granted, but by resolve of the House of Dele gates. X. Either House of the General Assembly may adjourn therrrselves respectively. The Governour shall not prorogue or adjourn the Assenrbly during their sitting, nor dissolve therrr at any time ; but he shall, if neces sary, either by advice of the Council of State, or on application of a majority of the House of Delegates, call them before the time to which they shall stand prorogued or adjourned. XI. A Privy Council, or Council of State, consisting of eight mem bers, shall be chosen by joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly, either from their own members or the people at large, to assist in the administra tion of government. They shall annually choose out of their own mem bers a president, who, in case of the death, inability, or necessary absence of the Governour from the governnrent, shall act as Lieutenant-Govern our. Four members shall be sufficient to act, and their advice and pro ceedings shall be eirtered of record, and signed by the members present (to any part whereof any member may enter his dissent) to be laid before the Gerreral Assembly , when called for by them. This Council irray appoint their own clerk, who shall have a salary settled by law, and take an oath of secrecy in such matters as he shall be directed by the board to conceal. A sum of money appropriated to that purpose shall be divided annually among the members, in proportiorr to their atteirdance ; and they shall be incapable, during their continuance iu office, of sitting in either House of Assenrbly. Two members shall be removed by joint ballot of both Houses of Assenrblv at the end of every three years, and be ineligible for the three next years. These vacancies, as well as those occasioned by death or incapacity, shall be supplied by new elections, in the same manner. XII. The delegates for Virginia to the Continental Congress shall be chosen annually, or superseded in the meantime by joint ballot of both Houses of Assembly. XIII. The present militia officers shall be continued, and vacancies supplied by appointment of the Governour, with the advice of the Privy Council, or recommendations fronr the respective county courts ; but the Governour and Council shall have a power of suspending any officer, and ordering a court-martial on complaint of misbehaviour or inability, or to supply vacancies of officers happening when iir actual service. The Gov-"], [266, "THE GOVERNORS OF V/RG/N/A. 230 errrour may embody the militia, with the advice of the Privy Council ; and, when embodied, shall alone have the direction of the militia under the laws of the country. The two Houses of Assenrbly shall, by joint ballot, appoint Judges of the Supreme Court of Appeals, and General Court, Judges in Chancery, Judges of Admiralty, Secretary, and the Attorney-General, to be commis sioned by the Governour, and continue in office during good behaviour. In case of death, incapacity, or resignation, the Governour, with the advice of the Privy Council, shall appoint persons to succeed in office, to be approved or displaced by both Houses. These officers shall have fixed and adequate salaries, and, together with all others holding lucrative offices, and all ministers of the Gospel of every denomination, be incapa ble of being elected members of either House of Assembly, or the Privy Council. XV. The Governour, with the advice of the Privy Council, shall appoint Justices of the Peace for the counties ; and in case of vacancies, or a necessity of increasing the number hereafter, such appointments to be nrade upon the recommendation of the respective county courts. The present acting Secretary' in Virginia, and Clerks of all the County Courts, shall continue in office. In case of vacancies, either by death, incapacity, or resignation, a Secretary shall be appointed as before directed, and the Clerks, by the respective courts. The present and future Clerks shall hold their offices during good behaviour, to be judged of and determined in the General Court. The Sheriffs and Coroners shall be nominated by the respective courts, approved by the Governour, with the advice of the Privy Council, and commissioned by the Governour. The Justices shall appoint Constables and all fees of the aforesaid officers be regulated by law. XVI. The Governour, when he is out of office, and others offending against the state, either by trial-administration, corruption, or other means by which the safety of the state may be endangered, shall be impeachablc by the House of Delegates ; Such impeachment to be prosecuted by the Attorney-General, or such other person or persons as the House may appoint in the General Court, according to the laws of the land. If found guilty, he or they shall be either forever disabled to hold any office under government, or removed from such office pro tempore, or subjected to such pains or penalties as the law shall direct. XVII. If all, or any of the Judges of the General Court, shall, on good grounds (to be judged of by the House Delegates) be accused of any of the crimes or offences before-mentioned, such House of Delegates may in like manner, impeach the Judge or Judges so accused, to be prosecuted in the Court of Appeals; and he or they, if found guilty, shall be punished in the same manner as is prescribed in the preceding clause. XVIII. Commissions and grants shall run, IN THE NAME OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA, aud bear test by the Governour with"], [267, "PATRICK HENRY. 231 the seal of the commonwealth annexed. Writs shall run in the same man ner, and bear test by the clerks of the several courts. Indictments shall con clude, AGAINST THE PEACE AND DIGNITY OF THE COMMON WEALTH. XIX. A treasurer shall be appointed annually by joint ballot of both Houses. XX. All escheats, penalties, and forfeitures, heretofore going to the King, shall go to the Commonwealth, save only such as the legislature may abolish, or otherwise provide for. XXI. The territories contained within the charters erecting the colo nies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, North and South Carolina, are hereby ceded, released, and forever confirmed to the people of those colonies respectively, with all the rights of property, jurisdiction, and govern ment, and all other rights whatsoever which might at any time heretofore have been claimed by Virginia, except the free navigation and use of the rivers Potowmack and Pohomoke, with the property of the Virginia shores or strands bordering on either of the said rivers, and all improve ments which have been or shall be made thereon. The western and northern extent or\" / 'irginia shall in all other respects stand as fixed by the charter of king James the first, in the year one thousand six hundred and nine, and by the publick treaty of peace between the courts of Great Britain and France in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty three ; unless, by act of legislature, one or nrore territories shall hereafter be laid off, and governments established westward of the Allegheny mountains. And no purchase of lands shall be tirade of the Indian natives but on behalf of the publick, by authority of the General Assenrbly. XXII. In order to introduce this government, the representatives of the people met in Convention, shall choose a Governor and Privy Council, also such other officers directed to be chosen by both Houses as may be judged necessary to be immediately appointed. The Senate to be first chosen by the people, to continue until the last day of March next, and the other officers until the end of the succeeding session of Assembly. In case of vacancies, the speaker of either House shall issue writs for new elections. The salary of the Governor to be appointed under the new Constitution, was immediately fixed by a resolution of the Convention, at one thousand pounds per annum, and the House proceeded to elect forthwith the first Republican Governor for the Commonwealth of Virginia. The question was decided on the first ballot, and Patrick Henry was the choice of these representatives of the people. In his reply \"To the Honourable, the President and House of Conven tion,\" in concluding his letter of acceptance, he says :"], [268, "232 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. \" I shall enter upon the duties of my office, whenever you, gentlemen, shall be pleased to direct; relying upon the known wisdonr and virtue of your honourable house to supply my defects, and to give permanency and success to that system of government which you have formed and which is so wisely calculated to secure equal liberty, and advance human happi ness.\" On the day that Virginia adopted her Constitution, she raised her chosen son to the highest office within her gift. And so, Patrick Henry, turned by an unseen Hand from the path to military fame, must wear the civic wreath with which his people crowned him. The brilliant orator, the daring soldier, had now the statesman's honors to bear before the world, and as a minister of the public weal, must prove worthy of the high confidence of his compatriots. The following extract from the Williamsburg Gazette affords a realistic picture of colonial life at this perilous time. On the 15th of May, 1776, the Convention of Virginia passed Resolutions instructing their delegates in Congress to propose to that body \"to declare the United Colonies free and independent states.\" Extract from Williamsburg Gazette, of May 17th, 1776 : \"In consequence of the above resolutions, universally regarded as the only door which will lead to safety and prosperity, some gentlemen nrade a handsome collection for the purpose of treating the soldiery, who next day (May 16th) were paraded in Waller's Grove, before Brigadier-General Lewis, attended by the gentlemen of the Comnrittee of Safety, the mem bers of the General Convention, the inhabitants of this City, etc., etc. The resolutions being read aloud to the Army, the following toasts were given, each of them accompanied by a discharge of the Artillery and small arms, and the acclamations of all present : \"1. The American Independent States. \"2. The Grand Congress of the United States and their respective Legislatures. \"3. General Washington and victory to the American arms. \"The Union Flag of the American States waved upon the Capitol during the whole of this ceremony ; which being ended the soldiers par took of the refreshments prepared for them by the affection of their coun trymen, and the evening concluded with illuminations and other demon strations of joy ; every one seeming pleased that the domination of Great Britain was now at an end, so wickedly and tyrannically exercised for these twelve or thirteen years past, notwithstanding our repeated prayers and remonstrances for redress.\""], [269, "PATRICK HENRY. 233 ' ' The Union Flag of the American States ' ' here spoken of, was probably one of the \"Union flags\" so frequently mentioned in the newspapers of those days, viz.: An ordinary English red ensign, bearing the Union jack, and carrying some patriotic motto, such as \"Liberty,\" \"Liberty and Property,\" \" Liberty and Union,\" etc., etc. In investigating the character of the earliest banners borne by the revolutionary colonists in the South, we find that the one adopted in South Carolina, September, 1775, was a large blue flag, made with a white crescent in the dexter corner. William Moultrie, Colonel of the Second South Carolina Regiment, selected this design, as the First and Second South Carolina Regiments wore in front of their caps a silver crescent. The flag bore also the word \"Liberty\" across its centre. The first armed ves sels commissioned by Washington sailed under a white flag with a green pine-tree. A yellow ensign bearing the device of a rattlesnake in the attitude of striking, with the motto, \" Don't tread on me,\" had also been pre viously used. This emblem was suggested, probably, by the cuts displayed at the head of many newspapers of the time, which represented a snake divided into thirteen parts, each bearing the abbreviation of a Colony with the motto beneath, \"Join or Die,\" typifying the necessity of union. On the 1st January, 1776, the tri-colored American banner, not yet spangled with stars, but showing thirteen alternate stripes of red and white, with the united red and white crosses of St. George and St. Andrew on a blue ground in the corner, was unfurled over the new Continental Army around Boston. It was given to the breeze at a critical moment, for this untried army consisted of but 9650 men. The first recorded legislative action for the adoption of a national flag, was on June 14, 1777, when Congress resolved ' ' that the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white ; that the Union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\" It is not known by whom the stars were originally suggested. After the Constitution of Virginia had been adopted, her XVI"], [270, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 234 statesmen next proceeded to select a device and motto for her seal. It seems like turning our eyes back to the first crimson streak upon the horizon of America, as we recall that earliest seal used upon Virginia soil when King James I. ordered April 10, 1606, that his portraiture should be engraven on the one side with the inscription, \" Sigilvm Regis Magn\u00e6 Britani\u00e6, Franci\u00e6 et Hiberni\u00e6,\" and on the other side, his Arms, with the inscription, \" Pro Concilio Prim\u00e6 Coloni\u00e6 Virgini\u00e6.\" To Queen Elizabeth's titles had been added that of \" Queen of Virginia,\" and James I., who was already the titular sovereign of four realms, now accepted as the motto for the London Company's coat-of-arms, \"Lo! Virginia gives a fifth crown.\" Although the accession of James VI. of Scotland, in 1603, to the throne of England as James I. really joined the two nations in one, still the countries were not legislatively united until 1707. After this union the motto of the Virginia arms consisted of the English shield, with the inscription, \" En Dat Virginia Quartam.\" During the reign of Queen Anne, 17 10, the broad seal of the Colony of Virginia represented a crowned female figure extending the symbol of the cross to an Indian, who, kneeling, offers her the first fruits of the land. The inscription on this seal was \" Sigillvm Provinci\u00e6 Virginia in America,\" \" En Dat Virginia Quartam.\" And now, last and best, we have the seal as proposed in the Convention of 1776, by Mr. George Wythe, and chosen by that body. On the obverse side is a female figure resting on a spear with one hand and holding a sword in the other, representing Virtue ; her foot is pressed upon the neck of Tyranny, indicated by a prostrate man, with a crown falling from his head, a broken chain in his left hand and a scourge in his right. Over the head of Virtue is engraved, \"Vir ginia,\" and beneath her feet is inscribed, \"Sic Semper Tyrannis.\" In 1779, when Thomas Jefferson was Governor, the General Assembly ordered ' ' Perseverando \" to be en graved on the reverse side of the great seal of Virginia. Better than the portraiture of Kings, or the emblazoned"], [271, "PATRICK HENRY. 235 shields of heraldry, is this sacred emblem of our liberty. Through it we read the souls of those who stamped their image on it, and learn that human happiness has no security but in freedom ; and that freedom has no foundation but in virtue. To return now to the consideration of Patrick Henry's life, we find that as soon as he was elected Governor prepara tions were made to provide a suitable residence for him at the Capital. The Governor's palace, together with the out buildings belonging to it, in Williamsburg, having by a previous Resolution of the Convention, been appropriated as a public hospital, was, by a Resolution of the first of July, restored to its original purpose, and the committee who had been appointed to notify the Governor of his election, was now directed to inform him of the desire of the Conven tion that he would make the palace his future home. On the fifth of July, the sum of one thousand pounds was directed by the House to be laid out in furniture for the palace, including the furniture already there belonging to the coun try ; and, on the same day, the Governor and members of the Privy Council took their respective oaths of office, and entered at once upon the discharge of their constitutional duties. The autumn of 1776, the year in which Patrick Henry was made Governor of Virginia, was one of the desperate periods of the Revolutions, \" Men's hearts failing them for fear, ' ' and darkness seemed to have settled over the patriotic struggle. The disaster at Long Island had occurred, by which a considerable portion of the American Army had been cut off \u2014 a garrison of between three and four thousand men had been taken at Fort Washington \u2014 and the American General, with the small remainder, disheartened and in want of every necessary, was retreating through the Jerseys before an overwhelming power. It was of this time that Thomas Paine wrote in ' ' The American Crisis, No. 1,\" \" These are the times that try men's souls.\" But, in the midst of the storm which raged around him, George Washington stood unmoved. Relying upon the"], [272, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 236 justness of his cause, which had been submitted to the arbitrament of the sword, he was resolved to do \u2014 or die. In these moments of supreme trial, the Legislature of Virginia swerved for a brief season from its fealty to Repub lican principles. According to Thomas Jefferson : \"In December, 1776, our circumstances being much distressed, it was proposed in the house of delegates to create a Ditlator, invested with every power, legislative, executive, and judiciary, civil and military, of life and of death, over our persons and over our properties ; and in June, 1781, again under calamity, the same proposition was repeated, and wanted a few votes only of being passed.\" That Mr. Henry was thought of for this office at both of these critical junctures, there seems to be little doubt, but those who have studied his noble character are well assured that no temptation to personal elevation would ever have led him to deny that watchword, \" Liberty or Death,\" which he had given to his people. In the year 1777, Patrick Henry married for his second wife, Dorothea Dandridge, granddaughter of Governor Alex ander Spotswood, and daughter of Nathaniel West Dan dridge, a descendant of Captain John West, the brother of Lord Delaware, once colonial Governor, also, of Virginia. Patrick Henry was re-elected to the office of Governor until the May session of 1779, when no longer eligible, according to the Constitution, he retired, not, however, without an effort on the part of his friends to retain him in his responsible position upon some legal technicality touching his appoint ment for the first term. But, he set the matter at rest by a letter to the Speaker, and retired at the expiration of his third term to his estate, \" Leatherwood,\" in Henry County. In 1780 he was again in the State Assembly, serving actively in that body until 1784. On the 17th November, 1784, Mr. Henry was again elected Governor of Virginia, his term of three years to commence on the 30th of that month. On the 29th of November, 1786, he resigned his position as Gov ernor while yet a year remained of his constitutional term. Although simple and unostentatious in his style of living, he found himself involved in debt at this moment, and private"], [273, "PATRICK HENRY. 237 honor rose superior to public duty. He determined to seek in the active practice of the law means adequate to dispel his financial obligations, and during the next six years he attended regularly the district courts of Prince Edward and New London. His success was abundant, and relieved him from the financial pressure so galling to his lofty soul. On the 4th of December, 1786, Mr. Henry was appointed by the Legislature one of seven deputies from the Commonwealth, to meet a Convention proposed to be held in Philadelphia on the following May, for the purpose of revising the Federal Constitution. His name follows Washington's on the list, viz.: George Washington, Patrick Henry, Edmund Ran dolph, John Blair, James Madison, George Mason, and George Wythe. The same cause, however, which compelled Mr. Henry's retirement from the executive chair of his state, disabled him now from obeying this almost imperative call of his country, and well may be imagined the conflict in that honorable breast between private and public duty. The Federal Constitution, the result of the Philadelphia Conven tion, was not viewed with favor by Mr. Henry, although it had the sanction of the revered name of Washington. He feared that it threatened the liberties of his country and endangered the rights of the sovereign states. A Convention was called to decide the fate of this instrument in Virginia, and Mr. Henry was chosen a member for the County of Prince Edward. It met in Richmond, on the 2d June, 1788, and rarely has so much talent ever been exhibited in a deliberative body in this country. Says William Wirt: \"We may mention, therefore, Mr. Madison, the late president of the United States ; Mr. Marshall, the chief Justice ; and Mr. Monroe, now the President. What will the reader think of a body in which men like these were only among their equals? Yet such is the fact; for there were those sages of other days, Pendleton and Wythe ; there was seen displayed the Spartan vigour and compactness of George Nicholas; and there shone the radiant genius and sensibility of Grayson ; the Roman energy and the Attic wit of George Mason was there ; and there also, the classic taste and harmony of Edmund Randolph ; ' the splendid conflagration ' of the high minded Innis ; and the matchless eloquence of the immortal Henry.\" In this meeting of intellectual giants the course of discus-"], [274, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 238 sion ran high, and for almost the only time in public life, Patrick Henry failed to carry his point. After the Constitu tion of the United States had been formally adopted, the government organized, and Washington elected President, Mr. Henry gradually became reconciled to the situation. His opposition in the Convention had not been wholly in vain, for he secured a variety of amendments, afterwards incorporated into the Constitution. In 1794 he retired from the bar, with an ample estate, and removed to his seat, \" Red Hill,\" in Charlotte County. In 1794 he was elected United States Senator, and in 1796 Governor of Virginia, but declined both offices, as he did in 1795, the appointment by Washington as Secretary of State, and subsequently that of Minister to France, by President Adams. After Mr. Henry had declined the position of Secretary of State, in 1795, it appears that General Washington desired his acceptance of the Chief-Justiceship of the Supreme Court of the United States. But having bid a final adieu to his profession, in 1794, he retired to the bosom of his family and never again made his appearance in a public character. It is true that in March, 1799, yielding to the request of Washington and other distinguished persons, and desirous of doing his part to avert what he feared would be the disastrous results of the \"Resolutions of '98,\" passed by Virginia, he offered himself for the State Senate in his district. It was only necessary for him to indicate his wish to fill any public position and he was only too gladly elected. His speech at Charlotte Court House in this connection was his last, and is said to have been worthy of his fame . After he had spoken the polls were opened and he was chosen by his accustomed com manding majority. \"As he finished he literally descended into the arms of the uncontrollable throng and was borne about in triumph.\" Perhaps, with a prescience sometimes given to humanity, they felt that his sun had set in all its glory. Too true was this prophetic instinct, for in three brief months thereafter, their idol's voice was hushed forever. He died on the 6th of June, 1799, and his ashes were tearfully laid to rest at \" Red Hill,\" his seat in Charlotte County."], [275, "PATRICK HENRY. 239 William Wirt thus beautifully describes Mr. Henry when he bade a final adieu to his profession and sought a season of repose, so well earned in a long period of devotion to public needs and private duties : ' ' He retired, loaded with honors, public and professional ; and car ried with him the admiration, the gratitude, the confidence, and the love of his country. No man had ever passed through so long a life of public service with a reputation more perfectly unspotted. Nor had Mr. Henry, on any occasion, sought security from censure, by that kind of prudent silence and temporizing neutrality, which politicians so frequently ob serve. On the contrary, his course had been uniformly active, bold, intrepid, and independent. On every great subject of public interest, the part which he had taken was open, decided, manly; his country saw his motives, heard his reasons, approved his conduct, rested upon his virtue, and his vigour; and contemplated with amazement, the evolution and unremitted display of his transcendent talents. For more than thirty years he had now stood before that country \u2014 open to the scrutiny and the censure of the invidious \u2014 yet he retired, not only without spot or blemish, but with all his laurels blooming full and fresh upon him \u2014 followed by the blessings of his almost adoring countrymen, and cheered by that most exquisite of all earthly possessions \u2014 the consciousness of having, in deed and in truth, played well his part. He had now too, become disembar rassed of debt ; his fortune was affluent ; and he enjoyed, in his retire ment, that ease and dignity, which no man ever more richly deserved.\" Although Patrick Henry began life in the school of pov erty, in his later years he enjoyed an independence which resulted partly from a remunerative profession, and partly from judicious purchases of lands. In his habits of life he was remarkably simple, always frugal and abstemious, and his example as the head of a family, as well as the Chief Executive of his native state, is without reproach. His conversation was remarkably pure and chaste, and he was never heard to take the name of his Maker in vain. Well may be repeated with undiminished fervor the conclusion of General Henry Lee's touching obituary : \"As long as our rivers flow and mountains stand, so long will your excellence and worth be the theme of our homage and endearments; and Virginia, bearing in mind her loss, will say to rising generations, 'Imi tate Henry.' \""], [276, "LXXI. THOMAS JEFFERSON. Governor. June i, 1779, to June, 1781. Upon the retirement of Patrick Henry from the executive chair, Thomas Jefferson was chosen by the General Assem bly Governor of Virginia, on June 1, 1779. He was the son of Peter and Jane Randolph Jefferson, and was born at \"Shadwell,\" Albemarle County, Virginia, on April 2, 1742. His father, a practical surveyor, had been chosen with Joshua Fry, (Professor of mathematics at William and Mary College), to continue the boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina, a work already begun by Colonel Byrd. Colonel Jefferson and Mr. Fry were also employed together in mak ing a map of Virginia. This association perhaps had a con trolling influence on Thomas Jefferson's life, as it inspired his father to bestow upon him the inestimable benefit of a lib eral education. He was sent to William and Mary College, at Williamsburg, Virginia, in the spring of 1760, and re mained there two years. In alluding to this period, in his autobiography, he says : \"It was my great, good fortune, and what probably fixed the desti nies of my life, that Dr. William Small, of Scotland, was then Professor of Mathematics, a man profound in most of the useful branches of science, with a happy talent of communication, correct and gentlemanly manners, and an enlarged and liberal mind. He, most happily for me, became soon attached to me, and made me his daily companion when not engaged in the school ; and from his conversation I got my first views of the ex pansion of science, and of the system of things in which we are placed. Fortunately, the philosophical chair became vacant soon after my arrival at College, and he was appointed to fill it, per interim ; and he was the first who ever gave, in that College, regular lectures in Ethics, Rhetoric, and Belles-Lettres. He returned to Europe in 1762, having previously filled up the measure of his goodness to me by procuring for me, from his most 340"], [277, "THOMAS JEFFERSON. 241 intimate friend, George Wythe, a reception as a student of Law under his direction, and introduced me to the acquaintance and familiar table of Governor Fauquier, the ablest man who had ever filled that office. With him, and at his table, Dr. Small and Mr. Wythe, his amici omnium hora rum, and myself, formed a partie quarrie, and to the habitual conversa tions on these occasions I owed much instruction. Mr. Wythe continued to be my faithful and beloved mentor in youth, and my most affectionate friend through life. In 1767 he led me into the practice of the Law at the bar of the General Court, at which I continued until the Revolution shut up the Courts of Justice.\" In 1769, at the age of twenty-six, Thomas Jefferson was chosen to represent his county in the House of Burgesses, where he at once took a stand with the opponents of parlia mentary encroachment. At this, his first session, he intro duced a bill empowering the owners of slaves to manumit them if they thought proper; but it was defeated, and its policy not fully embraced until 1782. It is calculated that upwards of 10,000 slaves obtained freedom in Virginia between 1782 and 1791, after the passage of a law, in 1782, authorizing the manumission of slaves.* After serving his term in the House of Burgesses, Jefferson returned to his practice, and in the following year removed from \"Shad well,\" his early home, to a residence destined to be the famous \" Monticello \" \u2014 the Mecca of many a pilgrim since. On January 1, 1772, he married Martha Skelton, widow of Bathurst Skelton and daughter of John Wayles, an influen tial lawyer of Charles City. This lady was young and beau tiful, and with a handsome patrimony added largely to Mr. Jefferson's happiness and fortune. In the spring of 1773, he was appointed by the House of Burgesses a member of the \"Committee of Correspondence and Inquiry, for the dissemi nation of intelligence between the Colonies, ' ' the plan of which he had himself aided in devising. In 1774 he published his defense of the Colonists in a paper entitled, \" Summary View of the Rights of British America. ' ' This document, as Jeffer son believed, procured the enrollment of his name on a Bill of Treason introduced into Parliament. But, it had a marked influence on the career of its author ; it brought him before * See Walsh's Appeal, I., 392."], [278, "242 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. the public in England and America as a bold advocate of con stitutional freedom, and as a brilliant and thoughtful writer. On June i, 1775, Lord Dunmore, the then \"Dissolving View\" of royal authority in the Colony of Virginia, pre sented to the House of Burgesses certain resolutions of the British Parliament, to which Jefferson, as chairman of the committee appointed for that purpose, replied in a very able manner. This forcible response to Lord North's \"concilia tory proposition,\" Jefferson laid before Congress in Phila delphia, a few days later. There it met with the warmest approval and placed Jefferson at once among the leaders in that important assemblage. When Congress proceeded to act upon Lord North's proposition, Jefferson as author of the answer of Virginia, was requested by the committee of which he was a member, to prepare the reply. This he did in Res olutions which were immediately adopted. On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee offered in Congress the memorable resolution from wdiich the Declaration of Independence was formulated. Being called suddenly home by the illness of his wife, he left to others the work which he had begun, returning however to his post, in time to append his name to the historic document. On the 9th of June, 1776, Jefferson was appointed chair man of that committee to which was delegated the stupendous responsibility of drawing up a paper explaining the causes of the taking up of arms, and proposing a declaration of the independence of the Colonies. Jefferson was ' ' unanimously pressed to undertake the draft ' ' by his associates in the com mittee. He yielded to their wish, and gave in that great Instrument his name to freedom and to fame, bestowing upon his country a state paper which rivals in renown that \"Keystone of English liberty,\" the Magna Charta of Runny mede. The \"Declaration of Independence\" was so com plete in every detail, that only two or three verbal alterations were made in it. It cannot be claimed, however, that this won derful Chart of Liberty was the result of the inspiration of the hour. It was the product of days of questioning and nights of study ; it was the calm and sober declaration that God,"], [279, "THOMAS JEFFERSON. 243 who had bestowed the blessing of human life, had also given with that life certain inalienable rights which this people dared maintain ; it was the final protest of the chainless mind against oppression ; the high resolve of many men nobly portrayed by one. Having served actively and efficiently in Congress during the session of 1776, Thomas Jefferson returned to his home in Virginia. He was re-chosen a delegate to Congress, but declined the appointment, devoting himself during the re maining years of the Revolutionary War to the service of his native state. He took his seat in the General Assembly of Virginia, October, 1776, and commenced at once that vig orous attempt at fundamental reform in the organic laws of his state which he felt that the new era demanded. He began by obtaining leave to bring in bills for cutting off entails, and for a general revision of the laws of the Com monwealth. This was a great work of reconstruction, which had its advocates and opponents, but the reorgani zation was in time complete. Jefferson in his autobiography says: \" I considered four of these bills as forming a system by which every fibre would be eradicated of ancient or suture aristocracy. The repeal of the laws of entail would prevent the accumulation and perpetuation of wealth in select families. The abolition of primogeniture, and equal partition of inheritances, removed the feudal and unnatural distinctions which made one member of every family rich and all the rest poor. The restoration of the rights of conscience relieved the people from taxation for the support of a religion not theirs, for the Establishment was truly the religion of the rich.\" Jefferson continued to sit in the General Assembly during 1777 and 1778, and battled successfully for these radical changes, the importance of which had so long engaged his attention. On June 1, 1779, he was elected Governor of Virginia, and ably and honorably discharged that office. At this time Virginia was laid under very heavy contri butions for the support of the campaign in Georgia and the"], [280, "244 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. Carolinas. She had nearly 10,000 troops in the Continental Army, and a steady drain had been made upon her resources for men, arms, horses, and provisions, so that she was nearly exhausted and utterly unprepared to resist the enemy upon her own soil. Her long extent of sea-coast, and noble rivers leading thereto, made her an easy prey to hostile fleets; there fore, when the hour for her invasion came, General Leslie readily took possession of Hampton Roads and Portsmouth, and Arnold, with less than 2,000 men, quietly ascended James River. Arnold entered Richmond, which had recently become the capital of the state, on January 5, 1781. The city was evacuated, the public functionaries retiring before the foe to avoid certain capture \u2014 but Jefferson remained until the enemy had actually possessed the lower part of the city, and until the last moment busied himself in attempts to protect the public stores. Arnold ravaged the place, burned some buildings, then took to his boats and departed. Although the name of Benedict Arnold is almost a syno nym for \"traitor,\" we would pause for a moment here and recall the many noble deeds of valor, which he at an earlier day performed for his bleeding country- He was born in Connecticut and died in London, and the story of his cheq uered life is the sad recital of that ever vain endeavor to avenge personal wrongs at the expense of personal honor. A distinguished officer in the patriot cause of the Rev olution, wearing the honors of a Major-General, he allowed fancied slights on the part of Congress to turn the current of his fealty, and in an evil hour of wild temptation he became that fallen thing . men call \u2014 a traitor. After betraying his country, he received a commission as Major-General in the British Army, and after the surrender of Corn wallis, he went to England and was paid in gold the reckon ing of his infamy. But the English Crown itself could not outweigh his sin, or hide the mark of Cain now stamped upon his brow ! Arnold was shunned by men of honor everywhere, and died far from his native land, in want, neglect, and fell despair. 'Tis told, that in his dying hour he"], [281, "THOMAS JEFFERSON. 245 clasped an old blue coat ; the remnant of a tattered flag with here and there a silver star ; and pressed to his failing heart a parchment which bore his commission as Colonel in the Con tinental Army ! That coat he had worn as he planted the American banner on Ticonderoga \u2014 it had been torn by a bullet in the fight at Quebec \u2014 and that commission, as it lay in his nerveless hands, seemed like a benediction to his pass ing soul. Might it be, perchance, a passport to the silent pity of his countrymen ! After the abandonment of Richmond the legislators assembled in Charlottesville, where Cornwallis determined to attempt their capture. Tarleton was selected for this raid, but only succeeded in dispersing the Legislature and in driving Jefferson from his home at Monticello, from which place he escaped on horseback just in time to avoid capture. Jefferson's term of office had expired two days before Tarleton entered Charlottesville, and he had determined to decline a re-election. In his autobiography he says that he came to this conclusion ' ' from a belief that under the pressure of the invasion under which we were then laboring, the public would have more confidence in a military chief.\" Of course this step gave rise to criticism, but it was silenced by a Resolu tion passed \"In the House of Delegates, Wednesday, 12th December, 1781, and agreed to by the Senate, December 15, 1781,\" viz.: \"Resolved, That the sincere thanks of the General Assembly be given to our former Governor, Thomas Jefferson, Esquire, for his impartial, upright, and attentive administration whilst in office. The Assembly wish in the strongest manner to declare the high opinion which they entertain of Mr. Jefferson's ability, rectitude and integrity as Chief Magistrate of this Common-wealth,\" etc. It was during Mr. Jefferson's administration as Governor, that Virginia, in the interests of harmony among the sister states of the untried Republic, made an imperial gift to her country. She had already bestowed her patriotism, intellect, blood, and treasure, and now she laid her princely domain of lands on the northwest side of the Ohio River at the foot of the Union."], [282, "246 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. RESOLUTIONS. January 2'd, ij8i. For a Cession of the Lands on the North West side of Ohio, to the United States. Copy sent the Governor, ( Thomas Jefferson) on the 15th January, 1781. IN THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES Tuesday, the 2'nd January, 1781. The general assembly of Virginia being well satisfied that the happi ness, strength and safety of the United States, depend, under Providence, upon the ratification of the articles for a federal union between the United States, heretofore proposed by congress for the consideration of the said states, and preferring the good of their country to every object of smaller importance, Do Resolve, That this commonwealth will yield to the con gress of the United States, for the benefit of the said United States, all right, title, and claim that the said commonwealth hath to the lands northwest of the river Ohio, upon the following conditions, to wit : That the territory so ceded shall be laid out and formed into states con taining a suitable extent of territory, and shall not be less than one hun dred nor more than one hundred and fifty nriles square, or as near thereto as circumstances will admit : That the states so formed shall be distinct republican states, and be admitted members of the federal union, having the same rights of sovereignty, freedom and independence as the other states. That Virginia shall be allowed and fully reimbursed by the United States her actual expenses in reducing the British posts of the Kaskaskies and St. Vincents, the expense of maintaining garrisons and supporting civil government there since the reduction of the said posts, and in general all the charge she has incurred on account of the country on the north west side of the Ohio river since the commencement of the present war. That the French and Canadian inhabitants and other settlers at the Kaskaskies, St. Vincents, and the neighbouring villages who have pro fessed themselves citizens of Virginia, shall have their possessions and titles confirmed to them and shall be protected in the enjoyment of their rights and liberty, for which purpose troops shall be stationed there at the charge of the United States to protect them from the encroachments of the British forces at Detroit or elsewhere, unless the events of war shall render it impracticable. As colonel George Rogers Clarke planned and executed the secret expedition by which the British posts were reduced, and was promised if the enterprise succeeded a liberal gratuity in lands in that country for the officers and soldiers who first marched thither with hint, that a quantity"], [283, "THOMAS JEFFERSON. 247 of land not exceeding one hundred and fifty thousand acres be allowed and granted to the said officers and soldiers, and the other officers and sol diers that have been since incorporated into the said regiment ; to be laid off in one tract, the length of which not to exceed double the breadth, in such place on the north west side of the Ohio as the majority of the offi cers shall choose, and to be afterwards divided among the said officers and soldiers in due proportion according to the laws of Virginia. That in case the quantity of good lands of the south-east side of the Ohio upon the waters of Cumberland river, and between the Green river and the Tennessee river, which have been reserved by law for the Virginia troops upon continental establishment, and upou their own state estab lishment should (from the North Carolina line bearing in further upon the Cumberland lands than was expected) prove insufficient for their legal bounties, the deficiency shall be made up to the said troops in good lands, to be laid off between the rivers Scioti and little Miamis on the north-west side of the river Ohio, in such proportions as have been engaged to them by the laws of Virginia. That all the lands within the territory so ceded to the United States, and not reserved for or appropriated to any of the herein before mentioned purposes, or disposed of in bounties to the officers and soldiers of the American army, shall be considered as a common fund for the use and benefit of such of the United American States, as have become or shall become members of the confederation or federal alliance of the said states (Virginia inclusive) according to their usual respective proportions in the general charge and expenditure, and shall be faithfully and bona fide dis posed of for that purpose, and for no other use or purpose whatsoever. And therefore, that all purchases and deeds from any Indian or In dians, or from any Indian nation or nations, for any lands within any part of the said territory, which have been or shall be rrrade for the use or ben efit of any private person or persons whatsoever, and royal grants within the ceded territory inconsistent with the chartered rights, laws and cus toms of Virginia, shall be deemed aud declared absolutely void and of no effect, in the same manner as if the said territory had still remained sub ject to and part of the commonwealth of Virginia. That all the remaining territory of Virginia included between the Atlantic ocean and the south-east side of the river Ohio, and the Mary land, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina boundaries, shall be guaranteed to the Commonwealth of Virginia by the said United States. That the above cession of territory by Virginia to the United States shall be void and of none effect, unless all the states in the American Union shall ratify the articles of confederation heretofore transmitted by congress for the consideration of the said states. Virginia having thus, for the sake of the general good proposed to cede a great extent of valuable territory of the continent, it is expected in return that every other state in the Union, under similar circumstances as"], [284, "248 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. to vacant territory, will make similar cessions of the same to the United States for the general emolument.

William Fleming was a Scotchman by birth, but emi grated early in life to Virginia, and was among the first settlers in that portion of Augusta County which was formed into Botetourt. In 1774 he raised a Regiment, which he gallantly commanded in the battle of Point Pleasant, where he was severely wounded. He had also served in the French and Indian War in 1755 and 1756. He was a member of the Council of Virginia in 1781, and represented the County of Botetourt in the Virginia Convention of 1788, which rati-"], [285, "THOMAS JEFFERSON. 249 fied the Federal Constitution. He was said to have been of noble extraction, had received a liberal education, and was of a bold and adventurous spirit. In the close of the year 1782, Mr. Jefferson was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to join the representatives already in Europe, to negotiate the terms of a treaty of peace, but the treaty was concluded in Paris in 1783, before he was ready to sail. As chairman of the committee to which this matter had been referred in the Congress of 1783, he had the pleasure of reporting a definitive treaty of peace with England. On March 30, 1784, he was chosen to preside in Congress, and was chiefly instrumental in revising and perfecting the Treasury Department of the government. On May 7, 1784, Thomas Jefferson was ap pointed to join John Adams and Benjamin Franklin in Paris, and to negotiate treaties of commerce for the United States with foreign nations. On March 10, 1785, he was chosen by Congress to succeed Franklin as Minister to France, and being re-appointed in October, 1787, he remained there until Octo ber, 1789, during which time he conducted many important negotiations for his country. Immediately upon his return to America, Mr. Jefferson was appointed by President Wash ington, Secretary of State, and filled the office with marked ability through the four years of Washington's first adminis tration. The Cabinet meetings were often very stormy, and this period is marked by the origin of an active struggle between the two great political parties into which the Amer icans had divided themselves. Alexander Hamilton was the leader of the Federalists, and Thomas Jefferson stood at the head of the Republicans. But, wishing at this time to retire for a season from public life, Jefferson resigned his office as Secretary of State, on December 31, 1793, and spent some three years in quiet at Monticello, devoting himself to per sonal affairs, which, through attention to public matters, he had somewhat neglected. The close of the eighteenth century should not be recorded without allusion to one of the most afflictive events which had XVII"], [286, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 250 yet befallen America. On the 14th of December, 1799, GEORGE WASHINGTON died at Mount Vernon, Vir ginia, aged 68 years, in favor with God and man. Said Mr. Adams in a letter to the Senate : \" His example is now complete, and it will teach wisdom and virtue to magistrates, citizens, and men, not only in the present age, but in future generations as long as any history shall be read. ' ' In September, 1796, Washington had announced that he would not again be a candidate for the presidency, and there upon the political parties of the country settled upon John Adams, of Massachusetts, as the candidate of the Federalists, and Thomas Jefferson, of Virginia, as the standard bearer of the Republicans. Mr. Adams was elected President, and Mr. Jefferson, as was then the law, became the Vice-President of the United States. On March 4, 1797, Jefferson took the oath of office as pre siding officer in the Senate, and delivered before that body a short address, in which he expressed in a masterly way his attachment to the laws and his desire to fulfill his duty. This he did amply, and when the time rolled around for another presidential election, he was again the candidate of his party for that high office. Aaron Burr was the Demo cratic nominee for Vice-President. The Federalists sup ported Adams and Pinckney. When the votes were opened, it was found that Jefferson and Burr were elected by an equal number of voices. This threw the election upon the House of Representatives, where, after thirty-five ineffectual ballots, a member from Maryland, authorized by Mr. Burr, withdrew that gentleman's name, and on the thirty-sixth ballot Mr. Jefferson was elected President, and Colonel Burr became Vice-President. Jefferson delivered his inaugural address in Washington (to which City the Capital had been removed some months before), on March 4, 1 801, in the presence of both Houses of Congress. A new social as well as political era had burst upon the country. Jefferson, the philosopher of democracy, who"], [287, "THOMAS JEFFERSON. 251 had proclaimed and extolled its principles, was now, as the political head of the country, about to apply them. A change in dress and manners appeared ; the old regime had suddenly passed away, and the stately dignity and ceremony of Washington's administration were supplanted by a republi can simplicity. Jefferson himself headed the movement, and sent his message to Congress by a common messenger ; before his day, the President had in person made the communication, to which the Speaker, in behalf of Congress, had at once replied in a formal address. This term of Mr. Jefferson was distinguished by the purchase from France of the entire territory of Louisiana, in 1803, for the sum of $15,000,000. In 1803, Commodore Preble vindicated American rights in the Mediterranean against the Emperor of Morocco. With an American fleet he bombarded the town and forts of Tripoli. The United States, it has been remarked, set the first example to the world, of obliging the Barbary powers to respect its flag by the force of arms, instead of a disgraceful tribute. In 1803, the frigate Philadelphia, belonging to Preble 's squad ron and commanded by Captain Bainbridge, struck on a rock in the harbor of Tripoli, and was taken by the Tripolitans; her officers and crew, amounting to 300 men, were made prisoners. In 1804, Stephen Decatur, a lieuten ant in the American navy, with Preble's approval sailed from Syracuse in a small schooner, with seventy men, accompanied by the brig Syren, with the* design of retaking or destroying the captured frigate Philadelphia, at Tripoli. He succeeded in setting fire to her, February 16, 1804, amidst a tremen dous assault from two corsairs and the batteries on shore. Having accomplished his mission, he retired with his brave and daring companions. Tripoli was afterwards bombarded, in August, by the Americans, compelled to sue for peace, and the treaty for same was concluded June 3 , 1 805 . The acquisition of Louisiana, the naval victories, and general prosperity of the country added no little to the popularity of the new order of things, and Jefferson was reflected President, with George Clinton, of New York, as"], [288, "252 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. Vice-President, for the term commencing March 4, 1805. The Democratic majority was 148, out of 176 electoral votes. In 1806 the President was called upon to arrest Aaron Burr for suspected treasonable operations in the Southwest. He was accused of prosecuting a scheme for the separa tion of the Western States from the Union, was brought to trial in Richmond, Virginia, but no overt act of treason could be proved, and the jury rendered the verdict, ' ' Aaron Burr is not proved to be guilty under the in dictment by any evidence submitted to us.\" This trial, on account of the high position of the accused, became a matter of national concern. The people trembled to see a man who had been a distinguished soldier and statesman, and candidate for the Presidency (which high office he came within one vote of obtaining, and then voluntarily withdrew from the contest) ; a man who had been Vice-President of the United States for four years, and whose name had become identified with the honor of the nation \u2014 the people trembled to see this man arrested for high treason, and the country felt relieved when the great trial was at an end. About this time, trouble with Great Britain again threat ened the tranquility of the United States. England was engaged in war with France, and was contending with a nation stimulated by the ambition of the Emperor Napoleon. She needed men for her navy, and she allowed her naval offi cers to impress British seamen from merchant vessels, and force them to serve on men-of-war. She also claimed the right to impress her own subjects when found on ships of other nations. This led to the conflict between the Ameri can frigate Chesapeake, sailing from Hampton Roads, and the British ship Leopard, one of a squadron then at anchor within the limits of the United States, in which the Chesa peake, unprepared for armed resistance to the arbitrary demand of the commander of the Leopard, was compelled to surrender. She remained under fire twenty or thirty min utes, suffered much damage, lost three men killed and eight een wounded, when Commodore Barron ordered his colors to be struck and handed over his ship to the enemy. The com-"], [289, "THOMAS JEFFERSON. 253 mander of the Leopard sent an officer on board, who took possession of the Chesapeake, mustered her crew, and carry ing off four of her men, abandoned the ship, which Commo dore Barron took back to Hampton Roads. On receiving information of this outrage, Jefferson, by proclamation, inter dicted the harbors and waters of the United States to all armed British vessels, forbade intercourse with them, and made such other preparations as the occasion appeared to require. An armed vessel of the United States was dis patched with instructions to the American minister at Lon don to call on the British government for the satisfaction and security which the outrage demanded. Whilst now the war between England and France was agi tating the Old World, America sought to preserve a proper neutrality. But England, all-powerful on the seas, tried to interrupt our trade with France or her dependencies, and Na poleon issued orders to prevent our trade with England. In this trying situation, Jefferson thought that the United States might get the offensive decrees repealed, by stopping all its trade with the outside world. In pursuance of these views an Act was passed in December, 1807, forbidding the departure of vessels from American ports; it was known as \"Jefferson's Embargo . ' ' This law gave great offence to the Federalists , but it was only intended as a temporary resort, and was repealed in February, 1809, by Congress, who substituted for it an Act of non-intercourse with France and England. At this interesting point in the history of his country, Jefferson retired from public life and terminated his political career. But a long period of varied and extended usefulness was yet in store for this distinguished son of Virginia. Though personally removed from the turmoil of public life, his interest in the affairs of his country was undiminished. From his home at Monticello, he still, through others, largely controlled the direction of events at the Capital, and the sovereignty of his intellect was still as decisive as when he himself held office. In matters of internal concern he now busied himself, and directed his talents and influence to the promotion of University education in his native state. He"], [290, "254 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. was largely instrumental in establishing the \" University of Virginia,\" near Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1817, and in 1819 superintended the erection of the buildings himself. His connection with this institution of learning was a source of pleasure and of pride to him, and when he drew up the epitaph to be inscribed upon his tomb, he added to the words, \" Author of the Declaration of Independence, and of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom,\" these others : \" and father of the University of Virginia.\" What a canopy to cover a single grave ! It should be here noted that Jefferson's first desire in connection with University education in Virginia, was to transform William and Mary College, his alma mater, into a state university. For this he struggled long and well, but insurmountable objections to this plan turned his views to the establishment of a separate institution. It is deeply in teresting to observe how keenly alive were both Washington and Jefferson to the importance of higher education at home. Washington, in a letter to Governor Brooke, of Virginia, says : \" It is with indescribable regret that I have seen the youth of the United States migrating to foreign countries, in order to acquire the higher branches of erudition and to obtain a knowledge of the sciences. Although it would be injustice to many to pronounce the certainty of their imbibing maxims not congenial with Republicanism, it must never theless be admitted that a serious danger is encountered by sending abroad among other political systems those who have not well learned the value of their own. The time is, therefore, come when a plan of universal education ought to be adopted in the United States. Not only do the exigencies of public and private life demand it, but, if it should ever be apprehended that prejudice would be entertained in one part of the Union against another, an efficacious remedy will be to assemble the youth of every part, under such circumstances as will, by the freedom of intercourse and collision of sentiment, give to their minds the direction of truth, philanthropy, and mutual conciliation.\" These views were substantiated by the generous endow ment of a National University made in Washington's last Will and Testament. So, with eyes cast upon the future of this unfolding empire of freedom, both Washington and Jefferson hoped and planned for University education."], [291, "THOMAS JEFFERSON. 255 But the story of Jefferson's life is drawing to a close. A little past noon on July 4, 1826, his spirit passed from earth and left a great void in his home, and state, and country. At almost the same hour, John Adams, the venerable and dis tinguished son of Massachusetts, breathed his last, and this double blow was deeply felt through the length and breadth of the Union. Among Jefferson's valuable written contributions to his state maybe cited his \"Notes on Virginia,\" his \"Manual of Parliamentary Practice,\" and his manuscripts, under the title of ' ' The Writings of Thomas Jefferson ; being his Auto biography, Correspondence, Reports, Messages, Addresses, and other writings.\" With his own hand he wrote what men should read upon his urn \u2014 but, as the years roll by, the scope of his life-work broadens. The forces which he helped to set in motion have in their onward progress, \"unhasting, yet unresting,\" borne his name, with those of the patriot fathers, to a pinnacle of fame \u2014 to that high point of greatness won by a country which was their nursling once, but which, through their endeavor and the grace of God, stands one of the first powers of the Christian world."], [292, "256 LXXII. THOMAS NELSON, JR. Governor. June 12, 1781, to November 30, 1781. It surely demanded the heart of a hero to assume charge of affairs in Virginia at the critical period when Thomas Nelson consented to become her Governor. The tide of war had rolled from North to South, and now was rolling back again to engulf, if possible, the revolutionary cause upon the soil of the Old Dominion. The British successes in the North had been followed by more decided victories in the South, and the conquest of the whole country seemed to be but a question of time to the elated English. Virginia, ever regarded as the centre of the Revolution, was now selected as the most salient point at which to bring the whole matter to a conclusion. So, by sea and land, the British began to concentrate their forces about her devoted territory. In the midst of all the discouragements which environed the Rev olutionists, one gleam of light shone on the darkness \u2014 it flashed from the treaty of February 6, 1778, with France. The surrender in 1777 of Burgoyne's whole army to General Gates at Saratoga, had so advanced the cause of America in the sympathies of France, that her wavering policy then became fixed, and on the 6th February, Louis XVI. entered into treaties of amity and commerce, and of alliance with the United States, on the footing of the most perfect equality and reciprocity. This alliance under Providence was certainly one of the great causes of the final triumph at Yorktown, and of the permanent establishment of American independ ence. And now, in 1781, when hemmed in on every side, the hope which sustained the patriots came mostly from their"], [293, "THOMAS NELSON, JR. 257 French allies. The British were closing in upon Virginia, and desperate seemed the cause of liberty. It was in such an hour as this that Thomas Nelson assumed the rudder of the ship of state, to guide it through the gathering storm, not knowing what the end might be. Thomas Nelson, junior, was born in York County, Vir ginia, December 26, 1738, and died in Hanover County, Virginia, January 4, 1789. But between \" the coming \" and \"the going \" he wrought a noble work, and left his footprints in the sands of time. He was the son of William Nelson, for many years President of the Colonial Council of Vir ginia, and at one time Acting Governor of the Colony, and grandson of Thomas Nelson, the first of the name in Virginia. This last Thomas Nelson, came from Penriff, near the border of Scotland, and was called \"Scotch Tom\" on that account. Thomas Nelson, the subject of this sketch, was early placed by his father under the care of the Reverend Mr. Yates, of Gloucester County, Virginia (afterwards Presi dent of William and Mary College) , in order to prepare him for an English university. At the age of fourteen he was sent to England, and was for some time at a preparatory school of Dr. Newcome, at Hackney, and afterwards under the special care and tutorship of Dr. Porteus. He graduated with distinction from Trinity College, Cambridge, and after an absence of seven years, he returned to Virginia. Being just twenty-one years of age, hewas elected to the House of Burgesses on his voyage home, as an evidence of the esteem in which his father was held, and of the hopes entertained of the son. In 1762 Thomas Nelson married Lucy Grymes, of Mid dlesex County, Virginia, eldest daughter of Philip and Mary Randolph Grymes ; settled at Yorktown, and, being associated with his father as a merchant, was in affluent private circum stances. At his father's death he came into the possession of a handsome patrimony. Thomas Nelson early became a decided partisan in the patriot cause, and rendered efficient services in the House of"], [294, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 258 Burgesses. He was a member of the revolutionary Conven tions of 1774 and 1775, and was appointed by the Convention in July, 1775, Colonel of the Second Virginia Regiment, which post he resigned on being elected to the Continental Congress in the same year. He was again called to administer in home affairs, and was a prominent member of the Virginia Convention of 1776, which met in May to frame a Constitution for her government. Here he offered the Resolution instruct ing the Virginia delegates in Congress to propose a Declara tion of Independence. Having been elected one of these delegates, he had the satisfaction of seeing the hopes and wishes of his people embodied in a crystallized form, and with unfaltering faith in its declarations, set his seal to the historic instrument, July 4, 1776. In the following year he was com pelled, through indisposition, to resign his seat in Congress. In August, 1777, on the approach of the British fleet within the capes of Virginia, Thomas Nelson was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the state forces, and soon after, in response to an appeal from Congress, he raised a troop of cav alry which he led to Philadelphia, the point which had now become the theatre of war. During this campaign around Philadelphia, an illustration of the devoted heroism of the col onists may be seen in the following incident related by Gen eral Henry Lee, in his \"Memoirs of the War in the Southern Department of the United States.\" In speaking of the battle of Germantown and the scene at Chew's house, he pays a handsome tribute to young Captain Matthew Smith, a son of John Smith and Mary Jaquelin, of \"Shooter's Hill,\" Middle sex County, Virginia, and a descendant of some of the earli est and most distinguished settlers of that Colony. General Lee says : \"The halt at Chew's house was taken after some deliberation, as the writer well recollects, being for that day in the suite of the Commander in-Chief, with a troop of dragoons charged with duty near his person. Many junior officers, at the head of whom were Colonel Pickering and Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, urged with zeal the propriety of passing the house. Brigadier Knox opposed the measure with earnestness, de nouncing the idea of leaving an armed force in the rear, and being always"], [295, "THOMAS NELSON, JR. 259 high in the General's confidence, his opinion prevailed. A flag of truce was instantly dispatched to summon the British Colonel, while appropriate bodies of troops were prepared to compel his submission. As had been suggested, the summons was disregarded by Musgrave, who persevered in his judicious defence, and Captain Smith, of the First Virginia Regiment, Deputy Adjutant-General, bearing the flag, fell with it waving in his hands. Thirsting after military fame, and devoted to his country, he obeyed with joy the perilous order, advanced through the deadly fire pouring from the house, presuming that the sanctity of his flag would at length be respected ; vain expectation ! He fell before his admiring comrades, a victim to this generous presumption.\" The danger from Sir William Howe's movements against the Colonists having been averted, Thomas Nelson's corps was disbanded, and he resumed his duties as a member of the General Assembly of Virginia. Here, he strongly opposed the proposition to sequestrate British property, on the ground that it would be an unjust retaliation of public wrongs on pri vate individuals. In February, 1779, Nelson again took his seat in Congress, but was soon obliged by illness to resign. In May, 1779, he was suddenly called upon to organize the militia of his State, to repel an invasion of Virginia by the enemy, and when early in June, 1780, Virginia resolved to borrow $2,000,000 to be deposited in the Continental Treasury by the middle of the month, Thomas Nelson, in that period of despondency and distrust, did, by his own personal efforts and on his own personal security, raise a large portion of the amount. This loan was in obedience to a call from Congress for contributions to provide for the French fleet and arma ment. General Nelson, also, about this time, advanced money to pay two Virginia Regiments ordered to the South, whose arrears were not discharged. Thus were his ample fortune and credit freely and liberally expended for the public good. And now, at a period almost of despair, he took the helm of State, being chosen by the people, Governor of Virginia, June 12, i78i,and in person, with the militia he could sum mon, opposed, with sleepless vigilance and wonderful military sagacity, the enemy invading his State. It was in no small degree owing to his exertions that the American Army was"], [296, "260 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGIN/ A. kept together during its stay in Virginia. Participating in the siege of Yorktown, as Commander of the Virginia militia, and having charge of the first battery which opened upon the enemy in the town, he pointed the first gun at his own dwelling, offering to the gunner a reward of five guineas for every shot fired into it. This house had been taken by Lord Cornwallis as his headquarters. During these days of trial and of peril, Governor Nelson had been compelled to assume dictatorial powers. Obeying the higher law of stern necessity, he did not hesitate to step beyond the written code, assuming here, as everywhere, any perilous consequence to himself, if thereby he could save his country. For these assumed powers, he was, however, fully indemnified by the following Act of Assembly : CHAPTER XXIV.* AN ACT To indemnify Thomas Nelson, Junior, Esquire, late Governor of this Commonwealth, and to legalize certain Acts of his administra- tion. I. Whereas upon an examination it appears, that previous to, and during the siege of York, Thomas Nelson, Junior, Esquire, late Governor of this Commonwealth, was compelled by the peculiar circumstances of the State and Army, to perform many acts of government without the advice of the Council of State, for the purpose of procuring subsistence and other necessaries for the allied Army under the command of his Excellency, General Washington : II. Be it enacted, That all such acts of government, evidently pro ductive of general good and warranted by necessity, be judged and held of the same validity, and the like proceedings be had on them as if they had been executed by and with the advice of Council, and with all the formalities prescribed by law. III. And be it farther enacted, That the said Thomas Nelson , Junior, Esquire, be, and he hereby is, in the fullest manner, indemnified and exonerated from all penalties and damages which might have accrued to him from the same. It seemed a fitting recompense, that General Nelson should have the honor of being Governor of Virginia when Cornwallis surrendered, October 19, 1781; when upon Vir weartheoIfvfrSgin'iaa.l'teS \"' Large' V\u00b0' '\u00b0' page 4?8' Novembe'-, '781, 6th of Common-"], [297, "THOMAS NELSON, JR. 261 ginia soil the British gave up 7,247 regular troops, 840 sailors, and 106 guns; when beneath Virginia skies the broken sword of the Commander of the English Army sealed the independence of America. Owing to failing health Gov ernor Nelson was now compelled to retire from public duty ; not, however, until he had seen the morning break upon the cause he loved so well. He resigned the office of Governor in November, 1781, and passed the remnant of his days in the retirement of a country home. General Nelson had entered upon the Revolutionary War a rich man ; he came out of it so poor, that after a few years had passed away, and he was laid in the old graveyard at York, without a headstone or slab to mark the spot, his prop erty, save the old house in deserted York, and some broom straw fields in Hanover, was put up at public sale to pay the debts contracted in his country's cause. Even the old family Bible with the births and baptisms of the family, with the little table on which it stood, was sold on that occasion. When the illustrious Virginia leaders of this period pass in review before us, we can dwell in admiration upon the lofty principles, the varied talents, the prudence and the courage which made ' ' The Father of his Country ' ' great ; our souls can glow and burn when we remember the services of Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, Peyton Randolph, Edmund Pen dleton, George .Wythe, George Mason, and Richard Henry Lee ; but the name of Thomas Nelson challenges a tenderer recollection. The tear will spring as we behold that grand old man, the embodiment of Christian and patriotic virtue, resting from his labors in the evening of life. We see him crowned, 'tis true, with the love and blessing of his emanci pated country, but we behold him bent beneath the weary disease of asthma, contracted in the soldier's camp, having the gaunt figure of poverty as the companion of his fireside, and the hungry spectre of debt as his constant shadow.

Although the surrender of Lord Cornwallis, October 19, 1 78 1, had virtually terminated the struggle for the independ ence of America, still the cessation of hostilities was not for mally proclaimed by Congress until April 11, 1783. War with its desolating train had now given place to the tranquil reign of peace ; but, that war, with its history written in blood from Lexington to Yorktown, had had its world-wide uses. It had created a race of patriots, the story of whose valor would never die ; it had given birth to leaders who had proved self-government a possibility ; it had opened the way for freedom of thought and action, and had snapped the cords asunder that had bound America to a Throne. Last and best, it had shown that the foundation of the infant Republic, cemented with the crimson current of human life, was the ground-work of a structure destined to be more enduring than any fabric that could be reared by peaceful arbitration. Nearly a hundred years had looked down upon its growth when this \" Union,\" tried in the throes of a tremendous civil convulsion, emerged from a ravaging war of four long years' duration, \" One and inseparable.\" What could have accom plished this, in its completeness, but the \"mystic tie\" of Lexington, Concord, Ticonderoga, Crown Point, Bunker Hill, Quebec, Boston and New York; of Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown and Valley Forge; of Savannah, XVI II 265"], [304, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 266 Charleston, Camden, Cowpens, Richmond and Yorktown \u2014 names, which like an amulet, had been hung around the in fant breast by every patriot mother, in every state, for well nigh a century ! Upon the cessation of hostilities with England, in April, 1783, and the return of peace, it was found that the \" Articles of Confederation \" between the states were not quite adequate to meet the new issues then arising. The necessity of vesting in a Congress, (differently organized from that under the Con federation) powers competent to provide for the national wel fare gave rise to permanent changes in the government. As a matter of interest it may be noted that, from the beginning of the War of the Revolution until the end, Virginia never ceased in her exertions to furnish her full quota of men and money in compliance with the requisitions of Congress, and when, in 1783, certain commercial restrictions were proposed, (made necessary by the action of England,) Virginia passed her Act conferring the power on Congress to adopt such reg ulations, suspending its operation, however, until all the states in the Union should concur. She also passed \"An Act to provide certain and adequate funds for the payment of this State's quota of the debts contracted by the United States\" (October, 1783), by conferring such powers on Congress as would best tend to raise a revenue essential to the restoration of public credit and the discharge of the public debts. This Act was also suspended until similar laws should be passed by every other state in the Union. The difficulties surrounding these and other questions gave rise to a change in the organ ization of the government, and to the adoption of the present Constitution of the United States. The territorial limits of Virginia have varied many times since the hour when England's Queen traced with her royal hand the name the new-found country was to bear. The limits of Virginia under the Patent of Queen Eliza beth to Sir Walter Ralegh, 1584, were vague and vast, but they assumed a more definite shape under her successor, James I., and the various changes in her boundaries have resulted from :"], [305, "INTRODUCTION. 267 I.

Upon the resignation of Thomas Nelson, Junior, Novem ber 30, 1781, Benjamin Harrison was elected Governor of Vir ginia, and continued in this office until November 29, 1784. He was born in Berkeley, Charles City County, Virginia, about 1740, his family having settled in the Colony as early as 1640. Mr. Harrison entered public life, in 1764, by becoming a member of the House of Burgesses, and soon by his ability and social prominence became a leader in the stirring scenes in which he lived. He was a member of the First Continental Congress, of the Virginia Convention of 1775, and of the second General Congress, 1775. This body having adjourned, August 1, the Virginia Convention on the nth of that month returned Mr. Harrison a third time as their representative, and on Septem ber 13 he took his seat. Here he filled many positions of responsibility, struggling always for the best interests of his state and country. His term of service having expired, August 11, 1776, he came back to Virginia, but not before he had enjoyed the satisfaction of putting his name to the Declaration of Independence ; an act which won for every ' ' Signer ' ' a patent of nobility far worthier than any that royal hand could give ; whose title was beyond the fictitious excellence of Star, or Garter, or Cross, or all the insignia of heraldry. In the autumn of 1776, Thomas Jefferson having resigned his seat in the Senate, Mr. Harrison was chosen to fill out his term, and after a brief absence of less than three months returned to Congress. He was immediately restored to his former place on all standing committees. On May 22, 1777, Virginia returned him for the fourth time to Congress, where"], [309, "BENJAMIN HARRISON. 271 he, as before, actively and successfully engaged in matters pertaining to the highest interests of the young Republic. About the close of this year Mr. Harrison retired permanently from the halls of Congress and devoted himself to the promo tion of his native State. He was soon sent from his county to the House of Burgesses, and elected Speaker of that body, which office he held uninterruptedly until chosen Governor of Virginia, on November 30, 1781. Through the trying duties which accompanied this high office at the close of the Revolu tion, he bore himself with dignity and ability, remaining the Chief Executive of the State until November 29, 1784, when he retired to private life. But his friends, unwilling to lose his valuable counsels, elected him, in April, 1791, to the Legislature. A severe attack of gout seized him just at this time, and in a few days his useful career was ended by death. Benjamin Harrison married Elizabeth, daughter of Col onel William Bassett, of New Kent County, Va. Mr. Griggsly, in his book on the Convention of 1776, says, \"Of all the ancient families in the Colony, that of Harri son, if not the oldest, is one of the oldest,\" and adds, \"That from the year 1645, to this date, a period of more than two cen turies, the name has been distinguished for the patriotism, the intelligence, and the moral worth of those who have borne it.\" The third son of Benjamin Harrison and Elizabeth Bas sett, viz., William Henry Harrison, was the ninth President of the United States, and the distinguished gentleman who now occupies that exalted position, and who bears the name of the old Virginia Governor, is the honored grandson of the hero of Tippecanoe.

December, 1784, to December, 1786 Patrick Henry was elected a second time, Governor of Virginia, in December, 1784, and continued in office until December, 1786. A sketch of his life having been already given in this work, we avail ourselves of this opportunity to relate some matters pertaining to his personal appearance and character not before mentioned, as well as to note some important events in his second administration. William Wirt, of Virginia, in his \"Sketches of the Life and Character of Patrick Henry,\" says: \"He was nearly six feet high, spare, and what may be called raw boned, with a slight stoop of the shoulders \u2014 his complexion was dark, sunburnt, and sallow, without an}- appearance of blood in his cheeks \u2014 his countenance grave, thoughtful, penetrating, and strongly rrrarked with the lineaments of deep reflection \u2014 the earnestness of his manner, united with an habitual contraction or knitting of his brows, and those lines of thought with which his face was profusely furrowed, gave to his countenance at sorrre titrres, the appearance of severity \u2014 yet such was the power which he had over its expression, that he could shake off frorrr it in an instant, all the sternness of winter, and robe it in the brightest smiles of spring. His forehead was high and straight ; yet forming a sufficient angle with the lower part of his face^his nose somewhat of the Roman stamp, though like that which we see in the bust of Cicero, it was rather long, than remarkable for its C\u00e6sarean form\u2014 of the colour of his eyes, the accounts are alnrost as various as those which we have of the colour of the chame leon\u2014they are said to have been blue, grey, what Lavater calls green, hazel, brown, and black\u2014 the fact seems to have been that they were of a bluish grey, not large ; and being deeply fixed in his head, overhung by dark, long, and full eye-brows, and farther shaded by lashes that were both long and black, their apparent colour was as variable as the lights in which they were seen\u2014 but all concur in saying that they were unques-"], [312, "274 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. tionably the finest feature in his face, brilliant, full of spirit, and capable of the nrost rapidly shifting and powerful expression, at one time piercing and terrible as those of Mars, and then again soft and tender as those of Pity herself \u2014 his cheeks were hollow, his chin long, but well formed, and rounded at the end, so as to form a proper counterpart to the upper part of his face. ' I find it difficult,' says the correspondent from whom I have borrowed this portrait, ' to describe his mouth in which there was nothing remarkable, except when about to express a modest dis sent from some opinion on which he was commenting \u2014 he then had a sort of half-smile, in which the want of conviction was perhaps more strongly expressed, than the satirical emotion, which probably prompted it. His manner and address to the court and jury might be deemed the excess of humility, diffidence, and modesty. If, as rarely happened, he had occasion to answer any remark from the bench, it was impossible for Meekness herself to assume a manner less presumptuous \u2014 but in the smile of which I have been speaking, you might anticipate the want of conviction, expressed in his answer, at the moment that he submitted to the superior wisdom of the court, with a grace that would have done honour to Westminster hall. In his reply to counsel, his remarks on the evidence, and on the conduct of the parties, he preserved the same distinguished deference and politeness, still accompanied how ever by the never Jailing index of this sceptical smile, where the occa sion prompted.' In short, his features were manly, bold, and well proportioned, full of intelligence, and adapting themselves intuitively to every sentiment of his mind, and every feeling of his heart. His voice was not remarkable for its sweetness; birt it was firm, of full volunre, and rather melodious than otherwise. Its charms con sisted in the mellowness and fulness of its note, the ease and variety of its inflections, the distinctness of its articulation, the fine effect of its emphasis, the felicity with which it attuned itself to every emotion, and the vast compass which enabled it to range through the whole empire of hurrran passion, from the deep and tragic half-whisper of horror to the wildest exclamation of overwhelming rage. In mild persuasion, it was as soft and gentle as the zephyr of spring; while in rousing his country men to arms, the winter stornr that roars along the troubled Baltic, was not more awfully sublime. It was at all times perfectly under his com mand ; or rather, indeed, it seenred to command itself, and to modulate its notes, most happily to the sentiment he was uttering. It never ex ceeded, or fell short of the occasion. There was none of that long contin ued and deafening vociferation, which always takes place when an ardent speaker has lost possession of himself\u2014 no monotonous clanguor, no dis cordant shriek. Without being strained, it had that body and enuncia tion which filled the most distant ear, without distressing those which were nearest him ; hence it never became cracked or hoarse, even in his longest speeches, but retained to the last all its clearness and fulness of"], [313, "PATRICK HENRY. 275 intonation, all the delicacy of its inflection, all the charms of its emphasis and enchanting variety of its cadence. \"His delivery was perfectly natural aud well timed. It has indeed been said, that on his first rising, there was a species of sub-cantus very observable by a stranger, and rather disagreeable to him ; but that in a very few moments even this itself became agreeable, and seenred, in deed, indispensable to the full effect of his peculiar diction and concep tions. In point of time, he was very happy ; there was no slow and heavy dragging, no quaint and measured drawling, with equidistant pace, no stumbling and floundering among the fractured members of deranged and broken periods, no undignified hurry and trepidation, no recalling and recasting of sentences as he went along, tro retraction of one word and substitution of another not better, and none of those affected bursts of almost inarticulate impetuosity, which betray the rhetorician rather than display the orator. On the contrary, ever self-collected, deliberate, arrd dignified, he seemed to have looked through the whole period before he commenced its delivery ; and hence his delivery was smooth, and firm, and well accented ; slow- enough to take along with him the dullest hearer, and yet so commanding, that the quick had neither the power nor the dis position to get the start of hint. Thus he gave to every thought its full and appropriate force ; and to every image all its radiance and beauty. No speaker ever understood better than Mr. Henry the true use and power of the pause; and no one ever practiced it with happier effect. His pauses were never resorted to for the purpose of investing an insignifi cant thought with false importance ; much less were they ever resorted to as a. finesse, to gain time for thinking. The hearer was never disposed to ask, ' why that pause? ' nor to measure its duration by a reference to his watch. On the contrary, it always came, at the very moment when he would himself have wished it, in order to weigh the striking and import ant thought which had just been uttered ; and the interval was always filled by the speaker with a matchless energy of look, which drove the thought home through the mind and through the heart. His gesture, and this varying play of his features and voice, were so excellent, so exquisite, that nrany have referred his power as an orator prin cipally to that cause ; yet this was all his own, and his gesture, particularly, of so peculiar a cast, that it is said it would have become no other rrran. I do not learn that it was very abundant ; for there was no trash about it ; none of those false motions to which undisciplined speakers arc so generally addicted; no chopping nor sawing of the air; no thumping of the bar to express an earnestness, which was much more powerfully, as well as more elegantly, expressed by his eye and his countenance. Whenever he moved his arm, or his hand, or even his finger, or changed the position of his body, it was always to some purpose ; nothing was inefficient ; every thing told; every gesture, every attitude, every look, was emphatic; all was animation, energy, arrd dignity. Its great advantage consisted in this"], [314, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 276 \u2014 that various, bold, arrd original as it was, it never appeared to be studied affected, or theatrical, or 'to overstep,' in the smallest degree, 'the nrod estv of nature ' ; for he never made a gesture, or assumed an attitude, which did not seetrr imperiously demanded by the occasion. Every look, ever}- motion, every pause, every start, was completely filled aud dilated by the thought which he was uttering, and seemed indeed to form a part of the thought itself. His action, however strong, was never vehement. He was never seen rushing forward, shoulder foremost, fury in his coun tenance, and frenzy in his voice, as if to overturn the bar, and charge his audience sword in hand. His judgnrent was too manly and too solid, and his taste too true, to permit hint to indulge in any such extravagance. His good sense and his self-possession never deserted him. In the loudest storm of declamation, in the fiercest blaze of passion, there was a dignity aird temperance which gave it seeming. He had the rare faculty of im parting to his hearers all the excess of his own feelings, and all the vio lence and tumult of his emotions, all the dauntless spirit of his resolutiou, and all the energy of his soul, without any sacrifice of his own personal dignity, and without treating his hearers otherwise than as rational beings. He was not the orator of a day ; and therefore sought trot to build his fame on the saudy basis of a false taste, fostered, if not created, by himself. He spoke for immortality ; and therefore raised the pillars of his glory on the only solid foundation, the rock of nature.\" In connection with the religious character of Patrick Henry, the following extract is taken from a letter written by the Rev. Mr. Dresser, who had charge of Antrim Parish, Halifax County, Virginia, from 1828 to 1838. Mr. Dresser says: \"He ever had, I am informed, a very great abhorrence of infidelity, and actually wrote an answer to 'Paine's Age of Reason,' but destroyed it before his death. His widow has informed rrre that he received the communion as often as arr opportunity was offered, and on such occa sions always fasted until after he had communicated, arrd spent the day in the greatest retirement. This he did both while Governor and afterward.\" These facts are corroborated by this extract from Mr. Henry's will, viz. : \"I have now disposed of all my property to my family; there is one thing more I wish I could give therrr, aird that is the Christian religion. If they have that and I had not given them one shilling, they would be rich; aud if they have not that aud I had given them all this world, they would be poor. ' '"], [315, "PATRICK HENRY. 277 Mr. W. W. Henry, the accomplished descendant of this great orator, says in his Life of Patrick Henry : \"The account of Patrick Henry's death, written by his grandson, Patrick Henry Fontaine, not only shows the Christian character of the man, but is a beautiful piece of writing. The doctor had given him a last dose of medicine, telling him at the same tirrre, 'Vou can live only a very short time without it, and it may possibly relieve you.' Then Patrick Henry said, 'Excuse me, doctor, for a few minutes! ' and drawing over his eyes a silken cap which he usually wore, and still holding the vial in his hand, he prayed in clear words a simple, childlike prayer for his family, for his country, and for his own soul, then in the presence of death. Afterwards in perfect calmness, he swallowed the medicine. * * Dr. Cabell went out upon the lawn, but soon canre back to his patient, whom he found * * speaking words of love and peace to his family, who were weeping around his chair. Among other things he told them that he was thankful for that goodness of God which, having blessed him all his life, was then permitting him to die without any pain. Finally, fixing his eyes with much tenderness on his dear friend, Dr. Cabell, with whom he had formerly held many arguments respecting the Christian religion, he asked the doctor to observe how great a reality aud benefit that religion was to a rrrarr about to die. And after Patrick Henry had spoken to his beloved physician those few words in praise of something which having never sailed him in all his life before, did not then fail hirrr in his very last need of it, he continued to breathe very softly for sonre moments, after which they who were looking upon him saw that his life had departed.\" The period embraced by the second term of Patrick Henry as Governor of Virginia, is very interesting. Among the Acts of 1785 and 1786, will be found, passed into laws, the most important bills, reported to the Legislature in 1779 by the committee of revisers appointed by the Act of 1776. At the session of 1786, an Act passed appointing a committee to take into consideration such of the bills contained in the revisal, prepared and reported by the committee appointed for that purpose in the year 1776, as had not been enacted into laws. This was superseded by the Act of 1789, con cerning a new edition of the laws, which was the foundation of the revisal in 1792. The preamble to the Act for the revis ion of the laws, October, 1776, reads thus: \"Whereas on the late change which hath of necessity been introduced into the form of government in this country, it is become also necessary"], [316, "278 THE GOVERNORS OF V/RG/N/A. to make corresponding changes in the laws heretofore in force, many of which are inapplicable to the powers of government as now organized, others are founded on principles heterogeneous to the Republican spirit, others which, long before such change, had been oppressive to the people, could yet never be repealed while the regal power continued, and others, having taken their origirr while our ancestors remained in Britain, are not so well adapted to our present circumstances of time and place ; and it is also necessary to introduce certain other laws, which, though proved by the experience of other states to be friendly to liberty and the rights of mankind, we have not heretofore been permitted to adopt; and whereas a work of such magnitude, labor, and difficulty may not be effected during the short and busy term of a session of Assembly : Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and it is hereby enatled by the authority of the same, That a committee, to consist of five persons, shall be appointed by joint ballot of both houses (three of whom to be a quorum), who shall have full power arrd authority to revise, alter, amend, repeal, or introduce all or any of the said laws, to form the same into bills and report them to the next meeting of the General Assembly.\" The committee appointed was Thomas Jefferson, Ed mund Pendleton, George Wythe, George Mason, and Thomas Ludwell Lee. In the House of Delegates, the 18th June, 1779, Benja min Harrison, Speaker, laid before the House a letter from Thomas Jefferson, Governor of the Commonwealth, and George Wythe, presenting this accomplished work. Such a permanent and radical alteration of the Laws of Virginia will be ever associated with the statesmen above men tioned, and the farther development of this plan will be hap pily connected with the second term of Patrick Henry as Governor of the state. The importance and significance of these changes are the best indications of the progress of a free and aspiring people. And so we bring to an end our brief and imperfect sketch of Patrick Henry \u2014 a man whose high destiny it was to fire the hearts of an oppressed people to a mighty revolution ; who has left us mainly the ends for which he strove and not the means by which he worked ; whose winged words, chain ing conviction in their flight, and yet refusing to be penned, are known only by the trail of glory they have left behind."], [317, "LXXV. EDMUND RANDOLPH. Governor. December i, 1786, to December, 1788. Edmund Randolph was born in Williamsburg, the Capital of the Colony of Virginia, August 10, 1753. It was in this memorable year that the people of Virginia were alarmed by the report that the French, aided by the Indians, were erecting a long line of military posts on the Ohio ; this led George Washington to offer to Governor Dinwiddie his services, to explore the wild and trackless forests west of the \" Blue Mountains,\" and to convey to the French command ant on this frontier, a letter of inquiry from the Governor of Virginia. History records the perilous nature of this under taking and the courageous manner in which it was executed. Thus, the year in which Edmund Randolph was born, was signalized as a very important era in the life of his native Colony, where his family had already borne a distinguished part. His father was John Randolph, and his mother, Ariana, daughter of Edmund Jenings. John Randolph was Attorney- General of the Colony, and was the son of Sir John Randolph, who had filled the same office and had received the honor of Knighthood for honorable services to the Crown, being spoken of as a most eminent man in his profession, and one of high character. Sir John Randolph had two sons, John and Peyton, and they in succession were Attorneys-General of Virginia. At the breaking out of the war, John went to England, and was succeeded in his position by his son Edmund ; but, bitterly repenting his choice, he died abroad of a broken heart, and directed his remains to be brought back to Virginia. They were interred in the College chapel. -79"], [318, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 280 Edmund Randolph now began a career of prominence, and figured largely for many years as the defender of his country in the Councils of his state and of the nation, and was the zealous supporter of the Church against all which he believed to be assaults upon her rights. He had been adopted by his uncle, Peyton Randolph, and had espoused his patriotic views with regard to the independence of America. In 1775 he sen-ed on the staff of Washington, was a delegate to the Vir ginia Convention in May, 1776, aud from 1779 to 1783 he was a member of the Continental Congress. On the 29th August, 1776, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Carter Nicholas, Treasurer, and Speaker of the House of Burgesses of Virginia. Being a member of the Virginia delegation to \" The Constitutional Convention,\" which met in Philadelphia, May 25, 1787, Edmund Randolph introduced, on behalf of his delegation, a series of propositions, fifteen in number, em bodying a new scheme of central government, known in history as the \" Virginia plan.\" This plan, discussed for two weeks in committee of the whole, was so modified, amended, and changed, that it could only be called the foun dation of what was finally accepted and signed by the delegates in due form. The authorship of \"The Constitution\" as then laid down, was clearly the product of many minds, and the source of some of its most vital phrases will never be given to posterity. We only know that the end attained was after long, laborious, anxious discussion and most sagacious com promise. Sectional differences of opinion were reconciled, and a distinct plan of constitutional union finally arranged. Washington presided at this Convention, and by his inflexible course did much to keep the assembly together \u2014 a conven tion whose almost continuous session of four months had more than once threatened to break up in disorder. It is to be regretted that so little can be known of the Constitutional Convention of Philadelphia; but the injunc tion of secrecy under which its deliberations were held, was never removed. The official Journal deposited by Washing ton in the public archives, and Madison's Notes (all given"], [319, "EDMUND RANDOLPH. 281 to the public at a later day), are the only extended testimony to throw light on this intensely interesting period \u2014 a time when Washington himself declared that our political affairs were \"suspended by a thread.\" In that dread crisis the past furnished no light to guide the statesman of this august meeting ; the present was full of doubt and despair, and the destiny of the American Liberty hung trembling in the balance. But, in this juncture, the majestic reason of George Washington triumphed. \"It is too probable,\" he said, \" that no plan we propose will be adopted. Perhaps another dreadful conflict is to be sustained. If, to please the people, we offer what we ourselves disapprove, how can we afterward defend our work ? Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair; the event is in the hands of God.\" If, in this memorable speech, Washington counseled imme diate action, and thereby cemented the opposing sentiments of the Convention by one decisive and imperishable step ; if he now laid the foundation of honesty and purity in Consti tutional government, we, the heirs of this rich legacy, are indebted no less to another Virginian for making the Consti tution, practically, all that it has been, is, and yet may be. To John Marshall, Chief Justice of the United States from 1801 to 1835, do we turn with gratitude for lifting these Resolutions from the mist and cloud of Doubt, to be the radiant source of light, and life, and happiness to millions of enraptured freemen. When as yet the Constitution was a doubtful experiment, Judge Marshall, by his clear, unanswer able logic, laid it before an eager world as a wonderful combination of Liberty and Law, and by his practical con struction of its beneficent provisions, he established it in the hearts and minds of his fellow-citizens as a wise and never to-be-abandoned system of free government. At the close of the momentous deliberations of the Consti tutional Convention, the plan adopted was disapproved by Edmund Randolph, but, in June, 1788, when it was sub mitted to the Virginia Convention in Richmond for ratifica tion, he pronounced decidedly for it. Of the deputies from Virginia who signed the Constitution XIX"], [320, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. ' 282 in Philadelphia, September 17, 1787, were George Washing ton, John Blair, James Madison, Jr. Those of the Virginia delegation who did not then sign it, were Edmund Randolph, George Mason, George Wythe, James McClurg. But the Constitution was finally accepted by Virginia through her Convention held at Richmond, and ratified June 25, 1788, by a vote of 89 to 79. Upon the resignation of Patrick Henry as Governor of Virginia, Edmund Randolph was elected to succeed him, December 1, 1786, and remained in this important office until December, 1788. A glance at the Acts of Assembly during this period will show the varied subjects which claimed the attention of his administration, developing through the laws enacted the gradual and intelligent prog ress of a people in the difficult experiment of self-govern ment. In 1784 Edmund Randolph had been appointed Deputy- Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Ancient, Free, and Accepted Masons of Virginia, and in 1786 he was elected Grand Master of the same body, when he named the-Hon orable John Marshall as his Deputy. His name is masonically perpetuated in the Richmond Randolph Lodge, No. 19, chartered October 19, 1787. It is also a matter of interest to note, that Edmund Randolph, on the 28th April, 1788, at the earnest desire of the members, named \"our illustrious and well-beloved brother, George Washington, Esquire, late General and Commander-in-Chief of the forces of the United States of America,\" as Master of the \"Alexandria Lodge, No. 22.\" After the death of Washington the name was changed to the \" Alexandria Washington Lodge, No. 22.\" In 1790 Edmund Randolph was appointed by Washing ton the first Attorney- General of the United States, a position which, as a man of elegant manners and an accomplished lawyer, he was well fitted to adorn. On August 2, 1794, he succeeded Jefferson as Secretary of State, which office he held until the 19th August, 1795, when he withdrew to private life and resumed the practice of law. The fact that he retired from the Cabinet of Washington was made the occa-"], [321, "EDMUND RANDOLPH. 283 sion of much comment by his political antagonists. He published a \"Vindication\" of his course, which ably and effectually silenced the calumnies of his enemies. Edmund Randolph spent the latter part of his life chiefly with his daughter, Mrs. Bennett Taylor, of Frederick County, and lies buried by her side in the old graveyard of that parish. Bishop Meade, of Virginia, says of the latter days of Mr. Randolph's life, viz. : \" I saw him during this period, and conversed with him on religious subjects, in which he seemed to take a deep interest. McKnight's ' Com mentary on the Epistles' came out about this time, and Mr. Randolph, who had probably never been much conversant with such books, became passionately fond of it, and sometimes talked of preparing and publishing some selections from it, or an abridgnrent of it, that others might enjoy the pleasure he had experienced in some of its elucidations of Scripture, which seemed to him, to use his own language, ' like a new revelation on some dark points.

BEVERLEY RANDOLPH. Governor. December i, 1788, to December 1, 1791 Beverley Randolph, son of Colonel Peter and Lucy Boiling Randolph, was born at \" Chatsworth,\" Henrico County, Virginia, in 1754, and was third in descent from William Randolph of ' ' Turkey Island.

He was a member of the General Assembly, and succeeded Edmund Randolph as Governor of Virginia December 1, 1788. In this position he served until December 1, 1 79 1. Many important Acts were passed during his administration ; among others may be noted : \" An Act concerning a new edition of the Laws of this Commonwealth, reforming certain rules of legal construction, and providing for the due publication of the Laws and Reso lutions of each session.\" Passed November 18th, 1789. \"An Act to amend an Act entitled ' An Act establishing District Courts, and for regulating the General Court.\" Passed December 17, 1789.

After the organization of the government under the Constitution, March 4, 1789, warm discussions took place in Congress on the location of the Capital, which were finally settled by the pas sage, June 28, 1790, of an Act containing the following clause : \"That a district of territory on the river Potomac, at some place between the mouths of the Eastern branch and the Connogacheague be, and the same is hereby accepted for the permanent seat of the government of the United States.\" The same Act provided that Congress should hold its ses sions at Philadelphia until the first Monday in November, 1800, when the government should remove to the district selected on the Potomac. The area fixed upon for the district was a square of 10 miles or 100 square miles. It embraced 64 square miles of Maryland, constituting the County of Washington, which was ceded by that State to the United States in 1788, and 36 square miles of Virginia, con stituting the County of Alexandria, ceded in 1789, as follows : AN ACT for the cession of ten miles square, or any lesser quantity of territory within this state, to the United States, in Congress assenrbled, for the permanent seat of the general governrrrent.

Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly, That a tract of country, not exceeding ten miles square, or any lesser quantity, to be located within the limits of this State, and in any part thereof as Congress may by law direct, shall be, and the same is, hereby forever ceded and relinquished to the Congress and Government of the United States, in full and absolute right, and exclusive jurisdiction as well of soil as of persons residing or to reside thereon, pursuant to the tenor and effect of the eighth section of the first Article of the Constitution of government of the United States.

Thus Virginia stood ready with her largess to the general weal, and with accustomed promptness met the pressing demands of the hour. The year of 1 790 opened auspiciously \u2014 business over the whole country was prospering, commerce increasing, and the outlook was very encouraging.

December i, 1791, to December 1, 1794 Henry Lee, the second child of Henry Lee and Lucy Grymes, was born January 29, 1756, at \" Leesylvania,\" his father's seat, which was situated on a point of land jutting into the Potomac three miles above Dumfries, then the county town of Prince William County. He was educated at Prince ton College, where he early displayed a genius which later events developed, and which displayed itself in a remarkably distinguished military career. He was preparing himself for the profession of law, and was about to sail for England to pur sue that study when the outbreak of war changed his destiny. Soon after the battle of Lexington, at the age of nineteen, he entered the army as captain of cavalry. He was present at many important actions in the Northern Department of the United States, was in the battles of Brandywine, Germantown, and Springfield, and by his prompt and sagacious course soon became a favorite of General Washington. In the difficult and critical operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York, Lee was always placed near the enemy and reserved for the command of situations which required the exercise of those high talents with which he was endowed. He was promoted to the rank of Major, in command of a separate corps of cavalry, and Congress, in November, 1780, advanced him to a lieutenant-colonelcy of dragoons, and added to his corps three companies of infantry. It has been said by a distinguished writer, in speak ing of Lee's command : \"It was, perhaps, the finest corps that made its appearance on the arena of the Revolutionary War. It was formed expressly for Colonel"], [326, "288 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. Lee, under an order of General Washington while the army lay in New Jersey. It consisted, at this time, of about 300 men in equal proportion of infantry and horse. Both men and officers were picked from the army ; the officers with reference only to their talents and qualities for service, and the men, by a proportionable selection from the troops of each state enlisted for three years or for the war.\" As an illustration of Henry Lee's coolness and daring, we will recount briefly two incidents in his Northern campaign. During the occupation of Philadelphia by the British, Lee's activity and success in cutting off their supplies and commu nications, drew upon him the special attention of the enemy. They determined to surround and capture or destroy him. This movement resulted in driving him into the \" Spread Eagle Tavern,\" of which we have the following account : \"General Weedon, in a letter to R. H. Lee, dated Valley Forge, 1st February, 1778, states that a surprise was attempted by two hundred British light horse against Captain Harry Lee, who was quartered about six miles below Valley Forge. The enemy on the night of the 20th Jan uary, set out upon this expedition by a circuitous route of twenty miles, eluded the vigilance of his vedettes, and reached his quarters at daylight. With great activity Lee first secured the doors, which they made fruitless attempts to force; then mustered his garrison, consisting of a corporal and four men, Lieutenant Lindsay, Major Jamieson, and himself, amount ing to eight in all ; and by judiciously posting them, though not sufficient in uumber to man each window, he obliged the enemy to retire after an action of half an hour. Lieutenant Lindsay received a slight* wound in the hand; four or five of his men, who were out of the house, were captured. Five of the attacking party were killed and several wounded. When foiled in their attempt to force the doors, they endeavored to take off the horses from a stable near the house, which was enfiladed by the end window. To this place Lee immediately drew his force, and, to deceive the enemy, cheered loudly, exclaiming, ' Fire away, men, here comes our infantry ; we will have them all ! ' This produced a precipitate retreat. He then sallied, mustered his troops, and pursued, but to no purpose. Garden adds, ' He assured the dragoons under his command, who gallantly joined in defending the house, that he should consider their future estab lishment in life as his peculiar care, and he honorably kept his word. They were all in turn commissioned, and by their exemplary good conduct increased their own renown, and the reputation of their regiment.' \" This event gave the Commander-in-Chief great pleasure, and he mentioned it in his orders with special approbation."], [327, "HENRY LEE. 289 Again Major Lee made a brilliant and successful movement upon the British post at Paulus's Hook (now Jersey City), toward the close of the summer of 1779. ' 'After the recapture of Stony Point, toward the close of the summer of 1779, while Sir Henry Clinton was encamped upon Harlem Heights, a plan was formed for surprising the garrison at Paulus's Hook. The enter- prise was intrusted to Major Henry Lee, then on the west side of the Hudson, back of Hoboken. A feeling of security made the garrison care- less, and they were unprepared for a sudden attack when it was made. Preparatory to the attack, troops were stationed near the Hudson to watch the distant enemy, who might cross the river and intercept retreat, for it was not designed to hold the post when captured. Lee marched with three hundred picked men, followed by a strong detachment from Lord Stirling's division as a reserve. Lee's march toward Bergen excited no surprise, for foraging parties of Americans as large as this were often out in that direction. The reserve halted at the new bridge over the Hacken- sack, fourteen miles from the Hook, from which point Lee had taken the road among the hills, nearest the Hudson. At three o'clock on the morn- ing of the nineteenth of August (1779), Lee reached the Harsimus Creek, at the point where the railway now crosses it, and within half an hour he crossed the ditch through the loosely barred gate, arrd entered the main work undiscovered. The sentinels were either absent or asleep, and the surprise was complete. He captured one hundred and fifty-nine of the garrison including officers, and then attacked the circular redoubt, into which a large portion of the remainder retreated, with the commander. It was too strong to be effected by small arms, and Lee retreated with his prisoners, with the loss ofonly two killed and three wounded, and arrived at camp, in triumph, at about ten o'clock in the morning. This gallant act was greatly applauded in the camp, in Congress, and throughout the country, and made the enemy more cautious. On the twenty-second of September following, Congress hon- ored Lee with a vote of thanks, and ordered a gold medal to be struck and pre- sented to him. On one side is a bust of the hero with the words, 'Hcnrico Lee, Legionis Equif Prefeclo Comitia Americana.' The American Con- gress to Henry Lee, colonel of cavalry. On the reverse, Non obstantib.

In January, 1 781, he marched his legion to the South and joined the army of General Greene. General Washington wrote, October 23, 1780: \"Lee's corps will go to the southward; I believe it will be found very useful ; the corps is an excellent one, and the officer at the head of it has great resources of genius.\" These resources soon had an ample drain upon them \u2014 in the expedition to the Haw ; when he crossed the Dan ; in his plan to ensnare Pyle ; at Guilford Court House ; in the skirmishes near the Dan ; when he rejoined Greene and crossed the Haw ; in hi's skirmish with Tarleton ; at the battle of Guilford ; at Fort Watson ; at the siege of Fort Motte ; when he captured Fort Granby and Fort Galphin ; at Forts Cornwallis and Grierson; at the siege of Fort Ninety-six ; at Eutaw Springs ; when he captured Fort Wat son ; at the siege of Augusta ; when he joined General Marion at Quinby's Bridge. His impetuous charge at the battle of Eutaw Springs saved the day, and in the wide-spread sweep which Lee's legion made from the Santee to Augusta, we gather some idea of his qualities and success as a soldier. From April 15th to June 5th, acting sometimes with Marion, afterwards with Pickens, and often alone, Lee's legion con stituted the principal force which carried the British strong holds. They made over 1100 prisoners, a number which quadrupled their own. Under such incessant and arduous service Colonel Lee's health became seriously impaired. In October, soon after the battle of Eutaw, Lee was sent on a special mission to Washington, and he arrived at York town about the period of the surrender of Cornwallis. Re turning South he remained until the close of the campaign, when he retired from the army. He parted with sorrow from the noble corps he had often led to battle, and separated from his commander and brother officers with sincere regret ; but he carried witliHiim ' ' the love and thanks ' ' of the great Washington, and the following tribute from Nathaniel Greene, viz. :"], [329, "HENRY LEE. 291 \"Everybody knows I have the highest opinion of you as an officer, and you know I love you as a friend ; whatever may be your determina tion, to retire or continue in service, my affection will accompany you. I am, with esteem and affection, your most obedient humble servant, Nathaniel Greene.\" Headquarters, January 27th, 1782. Colonel Lee returned to Virginia, and a short while after, married Matilda, eldest daughter of his kinsman, Philip Ludwell Lee, of \"Stratford,\" on the bluffs of the Potomac, Westmoreland County, Va. Soon after the settlement of peace, Colonel Lee was elected a member of the Virginia delegation to Congress, where he devoted himself to advancing measures preparatory to the adoption of the Federal Constitution. \"He was also among those of General Washington's friends who most earnesdy persuaded him to undertake the all-important duties of the first presidency. Happening to be in the vicinity of Mount Vernon, when Washington was about to fill for the first time the office of President, on the impulse of the moment, he prepared the address which was presented to that illustrious man by his neighbors, and was so well adapted to the occasion as to be thought by Marshall worthy to be transferred to the pages of history. ' ' ' ' The sentiments of veneration and affection which were felt by all classes of his fellow-citizens for their patriot chief, were manifested by the most flattering marks of heartfelt respect ; and by addresses which evinced the unlimited confidence reposed in his virtues and talents. Although a place cannot be given to these addresses generally, yet that from the cit izens of Alexandria derives such pretentious to particular notice from the recollection that it is to be considered as an effusion from the hearts of his neighbors and private friends, that its insertion may be pardoned. It is in the following words : \"Again your country commands your care ; obedi ent to its wishes, unmindful of your ease, we see you again relinquishing the bliss of retirement; and this, too, at a period of life, when nature itself seems to authorize a preference of repose. Not to extol your glory as a soldier ; not to pour forth our gratitude for past services ; not to acknowl edge the justice of the unexampled honor which has been conferred upon you by the spontaneous and unanimous suffrage of three millions of free men, in your election to the supreme magistracy; nor to admire the patriotism which directs your conduct, do your neighbors and friends now address you.

To that Being who maketh and unmaketh at His will, we commend you; and after the accomplishment of the arduous business to which you are called, may He restore to us again the best of men, and the most beloved fellow-citizen.\" In 1788 Colonel Lee was a member of the Virginia Con vention to decide upon the adoption of the Constitution, and was au earnest advocate of the measure. He subsequently served in the Virginia House of Delegates, and in 1791 was elected Governor of the Commonwealth for the term of three years. Colonel Lee's private life was at this time shadowed by sickness and death in his family. From Stratford, March 4th, 1790, he writes to Mr. Madison : \" Mrs. Lee's health is worse and worse. She begs you will present her most cordially to her friends, Mrs. Colden and Mrs. Hamilton, and unites with me in best wishes for your health and happiness.\" His biography goes on to state : ' ' This was her last message. She is mentioned no nrore in their correspondence. A few days after this he suf fered a second calamity, in the death of his eldest son, a beautiful boy of ten years old. He was devoted to the child, and found some consolation in wearing his miniature, which is still preserved in the family. He had previously lost a son, who died in infancy, named Nathaniel Green. Two other children remained to him, a daughter, Lucy; and a son, Henry, who so eloquently defended his memory, and who died in Paris, in 1837.\" On December 1, 1791, Colonel Lee entered upon his duties as Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia. This high office he filled honorably and creditably. On June 18, 1794, he married Anne Hill, daughter of ' Charles Carter, of \"Shirley,\" James River. But Governor Lee's life of civic distinction was broken in upon by a call to military duty. The Whisky Insur rection in Western Pennsylvania, resisting all peaceable attempts at dispersion, demanded a forcible suppression. To Governor Lee, Washington intrusted the general com mand of an expedition into the insurgent counties, con-"], [331, "HENRY LEE. 293 ducting the forces himself as far as Bedford. Requisitions had been made upon the Governors of Pennsylvania, Mary land, Virginia, and New Jersey for 15,000 men in all. The Pennsylvania and New Jersey troops formed the right wing, and those of Virginia and Maryland the left. Over the Alleghanies they made their toilsome way just after a severe rain, wading knee deep in mud. On the other side of the mountains, they found that the advance of such a heavy force had terminated all resistance, and they soon resumed their march homeward. In 1799 General Lee again served in Congress, and when intelligence was received of the death of Washington, he was appointed by the House to pronounce an eulogium. The Resolutions which he drew up on this occasion contained the words, now ever associated with Washington, \"First in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his cou?itrymen.\" In 1809 General Lee wrote his \"Memoirs of the War in the Southern Department of the United States.\" This book was re-published in 1827, with additions by his son, Major Henry Lee, and again in 1869, with revisions and a biography of the author, by his son, General Robert E. Lee. Possessing the peculiar charm of being written by an eye-witness of the scenes described, it is also a valuable contribution to the history of a period whose tremendous issues still fire the soul after the lapse of a hundred years. In 181 1 General Lee removed with his family to Alexan dria, for the purpose of educating his children, who, by his second marriage, were Charles Carter, Sidney Smith, Robert Edward, Anne Carter, and Mildred. About this time the second war with England stirred his soldier heart, and after the disastrous campaigns in Canada he was offered and accepted a Major-General's commission in the army. Pre paring to leave home at this summons, \"Business called him to Baltimore, and being in Mr. Hanson's house for the purpose of transacting it, he was detained there so long that when about to leave, he found it so surrounded by a mob as to prevent his departure. The results of that night, fatal to General Lingan, nearly fatal to General Lee, and disgraceful to party spirit, are too well known to need"], [332, "294 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGIN/ A. repetition. The injuries he received prevented his taking part in the War of 1S12, and eventually terminated his life.\" The outrages of this mob grew out of indignation at the strictures on the declaration of war, published by the ' ' Fed eral Republican,\" a newspaper printed in Baltimore. Suffering acutely from the wounds inflicted at this time, and being advised to try the mild climate of the West Indies, General Lee set sail thither in 18 13, and died on his homeward voyage March 25, 18 18. Instead of landing at Savannah, he only reached Cumber land Island, on the coast of Georgia. Here he was received by Mrs. Shaw, the daughter of General Greene. He expired at the home of his late beloved commander, and his remains were placed by his side. Thus closed the career of a distinguished Virginian, who bequeathed an honorable record of soldierly prowess and statesmanly ability to his family, his state, and his country ; but, whose greatest gift was in that son, who in later days did tread ' ' the ways of glory ' ' and the path of pain \u2014 Robert Edward Lee, the peerless knight, the perfect soldier, the humble Christian, the complete man !

The year in which Robert Brooke became Governor of Virginia, had been signalized by two very important events in the United States : \"1. The insurrection in Western Pennsylvania; 2. Wayne's victory over the Northwestern Indians. \"The first, taught Americans, among other lessons, that the new central government was strong enough in the hearts of the people to crush out banded resistance to its lawful authority in any local confines. \"The second, broke the backbone of the Indian War, and proved it thenceforth impossible for the copper-colored tribes to stem the course of white emigration towards the Missis sippi.\" On the 1st of January of this year, also, the foreign and domestic debts of the United States did not exceed the sum of forty-eight millions of dollars, so that the position of the country in every aspect was of the most encouraging char acter at home, and foreign relations were, for the time, tran quil. In 1795, Washington in his address to Congress, December 3, presents a pleasing view of the prosperity of the nation : \"Our agriculture, commerce, and manufactures prosper beyond for mer example. Our population advances with a celerity, which, exceeding the most sanguine calculations, proportionally augments our strength and resources, and guarantees our future security. Every part of the Union displays indications of rapid and various improvement, and with burdens so light as scarcely to be perceived, with resources fully adequate to our present exigencies, with governments founded on the genuine principles of rational liberty, and with mild and wholesome laws, is it too much to"], [334, "296 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. say, that our country exhibits a spectacle of national happiness never sur passed, if ever before equalled ? \" Under such favorable auspices, Robert Brooke became the chief executive of the Old Dominion. His grandfather had been a native of England, but came to Virginia in 1710 with Robert Beverley, the historian, and Governor Spots wood. He accompanied the latter on his famous expedition across the Blue Ridge Mountains, and was decorated with one of the Horseshoe badges, in memory of the trip. The badge is said to be still in the possession of his descendants. It consists of a golden horseshoe set with garnets, having inscribed on it the motto : \" Sic juvat transcendere montes.\" This Knight of the Horseshoe, Brooke, had several sons, the youngest of whom, Richard, married a Miss Taliaferro. Their son, Robert, is the subject of this sketch. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, aud did not return to Virginia until the Revolutionary War was in progress. On his voyage home he was captured and carried to New York, from whence he was sent back to England by Lord Howe, the British Admiral. From England Robert Brooke went to Scotland, and finally made his way to France, from which country he sailed to Virginia in a frigate containing arms which were supplied to the Continentals by the French government. He immediately enlisted in the cause of independence, and joined a volunteer troop of cavalry commanded by Captain Larkin Smith. He was captured January, 1781, in a charge of dragoons at Westham, six miles below Richmond, but was soon exchanged, and returned at once to the service. After the close of the war he began the practice of law, and in thk noble profession acquired marked distinction. In 1794, Robert Brooke represented the County of Spotsyl vania in the House of Delegates of Virginia, and in the same year was elected Governor of the state by the Legislature.

Robert Brooke's career was brief but brilliant, and before he had reached the prime of life, he was called by death to give up the rewards of honor and merit which his people delighted to bestow upon him.

James Wood, gentleman, having surveyed and laid out a parcel of land at the Court House, in Frederick County, Virginia, in twenty-six lots of half an acre each, with streets, for a town by the name of Winchester, and having sold the same to divers persons, who built and settled thereon, the town was duly established by Act of Assembly, February, 1752, Robert Dinwiddie, Governor. So, James Wood, gentle man, may be justly regarded as the founder of this interesting Virginia town. He was also the founder of a distinguished family. His son, James Wood, Junior, was born about 1750, in Frederick County, a county which he subsequently repre sented in the Virginia Convention of 1776, memorable for having framed the State Constitution. From that body he received a commission, November 15, 1776, as Colonel in the Virginia line, where he rendered gallant service; he was also engaged in the defense of the frontiers of Virginia against the Indians. He was long a member of the State Council, and on December 1, 1796, was elected Governor of the State. This year was marked by some important events, chief among them being Washington's retirement from public life. In his last speech to Congress he says (December 7, 1796); \"The situation in which I now stand, for the last time, in the rrridst of the representatives of the people of the United States, naturally recalls the period when the administration of the present form of government commenced, and I cannot omit the occasion to congratulate you and my country ou the success of the experiment ; nor to repeat my fervent sup plications to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe and Sovereign Arbiter of Nations, that His providential care may still be extended to the United States ; that the virtue and happiness of the people may be preserved ;"], [337, "fAMES WOOD. 299 and that the government which they have instituted for the protection of their liberties, may be perpetual.\" During this period, also, the great struggle between the Federalists and Republicans was at its height ; and the Alien and Sedition Laws, acts of the Adams administration, though aimed at French emissaries who were disturbing the public peace, startled the people as an invasion of the liberty of the citizen. Virginia began to arm. The Assembly directed the erection of two arsenals and an armory sufficient to store ten thousand muskets; and on December 2, 1798, passed the celebrated \"Resolutions of 'gS-'gg.\" These Resolutions declared \"The Alien and Sedition Laws\" to be an exercise of other powers than those conferred upon the General Govern ment . It was in the midst of this political turmoil that the two greatest Virginians of the century died. Patrick Henry expired in June, and Washington in December, 1799. Both died in the Christian faith. James Wood, as Governor of Virginia, upon whom was imposed so many important duties in an epoch of important events, maintained the dignity of his station and the honor of his people in a notable degree. After his term of office as Governor was filled, he was commissioned a Brigadier-General of state troops; he was also, for a time, President of the Virginia branch of the Order of the Cincinnati. He died in Richmond, Virginia, June 16, 1813. The County of Wood, formed in 1799, from Harrison County, was named in commemoration of his patriotic services. Governor Wood sustained a high reputation as an officer in the Revolutionary War, and although opposed to the prevail ing political opinions of Virginia during the administration of President Adams, he enjoyed such a share of the confidence of the people as to be placed at the head of their State Gov ernment."], [338, "300 LXXX. JAMES MONROE. Governor. December i, 1779, to December 1, 1802 James Monroe, twice Governor of Virginia, and twice President of the United States, held the reins of government in state and national affairs at important periods, and admin istered the high offices to which he was called with prudence, ability, and a complete devotion to the public good. He was the son of Spence Monroe, a planter descended from Captain Monroe, an officer in the British Army under the reign of Charles I., who emigrated to Virginia in 1632. James Monroe was born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, April 28, 1758. He was educated at William and Mary Col lege, which institution he left in 1776, to enter the army as a cadet. Not waiting to finish his course of education, he offered himself to his country's service in the time of her adversity. He was soon commissioned Lieutenant, and took an active part in the campaign on the Hudson. In the attack on Trenton, at the head of a small detachment, he captured one of the British batteries. On this occasion he received a ball in the shoulder, and was promoted to a cap taincy for gallantry on the field. He returned to the army to serve as Aide-de-Camp to Lord Stirling, with the rank of Major, taking part in the campaigns of 1777 and 1778, and distinguishing himself in the battles of Brandywine, German town, and Monmouth. By accepting the place of Aide to Lord Stirling, James Monroe lost his rank in the regular line, and failing in his efforts to re-enter the army as a com missioned officer, he returned to Virginia to study law under the direction of Thomas Jefferson, then Governor of the state. When the British appeared soon afterwards in Vir-"], [339, "JAMES MONROE. 301 ginia, Monroe exerted himself in organizing the militia of the lower counties, and served as a volunteer with the Vir ginia forces raised to meet the invading armies of Arnold and Cornwallis. In 1782 he was elected to the Assembly of Vir ginia from King George County, and was appointed by that body a member of the Executive Council at the age of twenty-three. On June 9, 1783, he was elected to the House of Repre sentatives, of which body he continued a member until the close of the session of 1786. In 1785 he married a daughter of Lawrence Kortright, of New York, a lady celebrated for her beauty and accomplish ments, and after the expiration of his term in Congress, being ineligible for the next three years, Monroe settled in Fredericksburg, Virginia. In 1787 he was re-elected to the General Assembly, and in 1788 was chosen a delegate to the Virginia Convention to decide upon the adoption of the Federal Constitution. In 1785, when in Congress, he had advocated an extension of the powers of that body and moved to invest it with author- ity to regulate trade between the states. This led to the Convention at Annapolis and the subsequent adoption of the Federal Constitution at the famous Convention held in Phila- delphia, 1787. But, when that instrument was presented to the Virginia Convention for ratification, James Monroe opposed its adoption, fearing that without amendment it would confer too much power upon the general government. The course of the minority in Convention was approved by the great mass of the people of Virginia, and Monroe was chosen United States Senator in 1790. Here he was a prominent representative of the anti-Federal party until the end of his term in 1794. In this year he was appointed to succeed Gouverneur Morris as Minister to France. Reaching Paris August 2, shortly after the fall of Robespierre, Monroe was received by the National Convention of France in full ses sion, on the 15th, with enthusiastic demonstrations of respect. The occasion ended by the President of the Convention giv ing Monroe ' ' the accolade , ' ' or national embrace, and the Assem-"], [340, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 302 bly decreed that the flags of the United States and of France should be displayed together in the hall of the Convention. But, Monroe's marked exhibition of sympathy with the French Republic, displeased the home administration, as John Jay had been sent to England to negotiate a treaty, which these expressions were calculated to impede. So, with charges that he had transcended instructions on the one hand, and failed to present the Jay Treaty in its true character to the French Government on the other, in December, 1796, Mon roe was recalled. On his return to America, he published a \"View of the Conduct of the Executives in the Foreign Affairs of the United States,\" which explained his position in the trying circumstances in which he had been placed. His own county, immediately upon his arrival, returned him to the state Legislature, and in 1799 he was elected Gover nor of Virginia. The first year of Governor Monroe's administration was marked by the historic event known as \"Gabriel's Insurrec tion.\" The immediate cause of this affair was never traced, but its sinister design, though imperfectly conceived and wholly frustrated, has made it a dark page in the annals of Virginia. At mid-day on the 30th August, 1800, Governor Monroe was informed that the slaves in the neighborhood of Richmond would rise that night, would murder their masters and families, proceed to Richmond, be joined there by other slaves, when they would seize the public arms and ammuni tion, kill the whites, and take possession of the city. This timely warning, together with the providential interposition of a storm which made certain streams impassable, frustrated this wicked plan. The plot was fully exposed, and it was satisfactorily demonstrated that a general insurrection of the slaves in the state was contemplated. The ring-leaders were caught and executed on the 12th and 15th of September, and \"Gabriel,\" the chief conspirator, suffered death in January following. Governor Monroe's action in this crisis was prompt and decisive. He called at once several regiments of state militia into sendee, and by viligance and determination crushed and extinguished \"Gabriel's Insurrection,\""], [341, "JAMES MONROE. 303 An event occurred in the last year of this term of Governor Monroe which must be briefly noted here. On July 6, 1802, in Winchester, Virginia, a Revolutionary hero of uncommon fame passed away. \"Daniel Morgan, of Virginia rifle renown \u2014 served everywhere, surrendered nowhere, served to the end of the war \u2014 died July 6, 1802,\" is the short but tell ing tribute paid this brave soldier in the ' ' Records of the Revolutionary War.\" He was born in New Jersey in 1737, and at an early age came to Virginia. He was a private soldier under Braddock in 1755, and when the Revolutionary War broke out he joined the army under Washington, at Cambridge, and commanded a corps of riflemen. He accom panied Arnold to Quebec, and distinguished himself greatly in the siege of that city. Later he was appointed to the command of the 1 ith Virginia Regiment, in which was incor porated his rifle corps. Winning ever laurels at the North, he became even more brilliant in his exploits when ordered to the South, and as a partisan officer won such fame that, after his victory at the Cowpens, Congress voted him a gold medal. After the war he was elected a member of Congress, but resided chiefly on his estate in Clarke County, Virginia. He died in Winchester, Virginia, and the following is the inscription upon the simple slab which covers his grave : \"Major-General Daniel Morgan departed this life on July 6, 1802, in the sixty-seventh year of his age. Patriotism and valor were the promi nent features of his character, and the honorable services he rendered to his country during the Revolutionary War crowned him with glory and will remain in the hearts of his countrymen, a perpetual monument to his memory.\" The occurrences of 1802, during Governor Monroe's first term in that office, would be imperfectly chronicled if the date of Daniel Morgan's death did not recall the lustre he shed upon the annals of Virginia. At the close of his term as Governor, James Monroe was appointed Envoy Extraordinary to the French government, to negotiate in conjunction with the resident Minister, Mr. Livingston, the purchase of Louisiana, or a right of depot for the United States on the Mississippi. This was soon"], [342, "304 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. accomplished, and in two weeks the \" Territory of Orleans '\u2022 and \" District of Louisiana \" were secured for the sum of $15, 000,000. In the same year, 1802, Monroe was commissioned Minister Plenipotentiary to England, and whilst in the midst of important diplomatic negotiations, he was directed to pro ceed to Madrid, as Minister Extraordinary and Plenipoten tiary, to adjust the boundaries of Louisiana. Failing to accomplish this, in 1806 he was recalled to England to act with Mr. Pinckney in further negotiation for the protection of American seamen, and to secure a treaty with Great Britain. The treaty was concluded, but not proving satis factory to the President, it was sent back for revisal. All efforts to effect this failed, and Monroe returned to America. The time for the election of President was now approach ing, and Monroe's name was brought forward by a consider able body of the Republican party, but, for reasons satisfactory to himself, Monroe withdrew from the canvass. In 18 10 he was again elected to the General Assembly of Virginia, and in 181 1 was for a second time chosen the chief executive of the state. On the 25th November, 181 1, he was selected by President Madison as Secretary of State, and was succeeded by George William Smith, Lieutenant-Governor, in the office of Governor. The position of Secretary of State he held until the close of President Madison's second term, with the exception of about six months (the last months of the second war with Great Britain), when he discharged the arduous duties of Secretary of War. He devoted his time and talents with great energy to the trusts confided to him, and infused order and efficiency into the departments under his charge. Finding the public credit much impaired at the time of the siege of New Orleans, he pledged his private means as sub sidiary to the credit of the government, and enabled the city to successfully oppose the forces of the enemy. At the end of Madison's term in 1817, James Monroe succeeded to the presidency of the United States, and in 1821 was re-elected without opposition. Although many import ant measures mark James Monroe's two terms as President of the United States, none will be more interesting tp the student"], [343, "JAMES MONROE. 305 of American history than the promulgation in his message of December 2, 1823, now generally known as the \"Monroe Doctrine.\" He said : \"The occasion has been judged proper for asserting as a principle in which the rights of the United States are involved, that the American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers.\" On March 4, 1825, Monroe retired from office and returned to his home at Oak Hill, in Loudoun County, Virginia. He was chosen a Justice of the Peace, and as such sat in the county court \u2014 a beautiful illustration of the untrammeled principles of this Republic, that a man should be deemed worthy to represent its interests at the courts of the great powers of the civilized world ; that he should be twice selected as the chief executive of his own state, and twice chosen to preside over the councils of the nation ; and yet, after these high honors, that he should feel it no falling off to sit as a modest Justice of the Peace, and in this narrower sphere hold out the scales of Right and Wrong. In 1829 James Monroe became a member of the Virginia Convention to revise the old Constitution, and was chosen to preside over its meetings, but ill-health compelled him to resign this position and return to his home at Oak Hill. His wife died in 1830, and in the summer of that year he removed to the residence of his son-in-law, Samuel L. Gouverneur, in New York City, where, in a few short months, he finished his earthly course. His life had been a long consecration to the service of his country, and he had enjoyed in an unusual degree the gratitude of his countrymen ; honors crowded upon him, and the influence of his large understanding, benevo lence, integrity, and simplicity, won for the period of his greatest power, the enviable title of ' ' The era of good feeling.

December i, 1802, to December 1, 1805. John Page, of \" Rosewell,\" Gloucester County, Virginia, was descended from Colonel John Page, who emigrated from England to Virginia in 1650. This latter is said to have had distinguished family connections, and he soon became promi nent in public affairs. He was a member of the Colonial Council, and died January 23, 1690, in the County of York. He was buried in Bruton Parish churchyard, Williamsburg, Virginia, and his wife, Alice Page, is interred by his side. Their son, Matthew, married Mary Mann, of Timberneck Bay, an heiress of large possessions, who bequeathed an immense estate to her son, Mann Page, the founder of \" Rose well.' ' This celebrated mansion was the pride and admiration of successive generations, and justly so, from its reputed grandeur \u2014 but, in later years, it has been standing on Car ter's Creek, in sight of York River, like a deserted English castle, an eloquent reminder of the transitory nature of earthly things. It has long been an accepted fact that the orig inal \"Rosewell\" plantation was the ancient Werowcomico, where King Powhatan in earlier days held his chief resi dence. Mann Page, the builder of the Rosewell house, was a man of wealth, his landed estates being in Prince William, Frederick, Spottsylvania, Essex, James City, Hanover, Gloucester, and King William. He had eight thousand acres in Frederick, called \"Pageland,\" more than ten thou sand in Prince William called \" Pageland,\" also; four thou sand five hundred in Spottsylvania, one thousand called \"Pampatike\" in King William, two thousand in Hanover, 300"], [345, "JOHN PAGE. 307 near two thousand in James City, besides other lands. His great-grandson, John Page, sometime Governor of Virginia, was born April 17, 1743, at \"Rosewell,\" an estate which he subsequently inherited. He was primarily educated by pri vate tutors, and finally went to William and Mary College, an institution from which he graduated with distinction in 1763. He was appointed a visitor of this College in 1768, and in 1773 he represented it in the House of Burgesses. As a member of the Council in 1775, he incurred the displeasure of Lord Dunmore by advising him to give up the powder which the Governor had seized. John Page displayed during the War of the Revolution an ardent attachment to the cause of the Colonies, was in 1776 one of the most conspicuous members of the Convention which formed the Constitution of Virginia, and was appointed one of the first Council under that Constitution. During the struggle for freedom he contributed freely from his private fortune to the public cause, and served as Colonel of militia from Gloucester County in 1781. In 1789 he was elected one of the representatives in Congress from Virginia, and continued to act in that capacity until 1797. In 1794 he served as Lieutenant-Colonel of a regiment from Gloucester County in the suppression of the ' ' Whiskey Insurrection\" in Western Pennsylvania. On December 1, 1802, he became Governor of Virginia, filling the office ably and acceptably until December 1, 1805. In 1806 Governor Page was appointed by President Jefferson, United States Commissioner of Loans for Virginia, and held that position until his death in 1808. Among some of the interesting events in the United States during Governor Page's administration, may be noted the Eastern Confederacy Plot of 1804. This disunion pro ject originated among some disappointed politicians, and happily came to naught. An Eastern Confederacy embracing all of New England, with New York and New Jersey, was the scheme for which these ambitious spirits labored at that time, but in vain. The Union, cemented in blood, was too strong for such disloyal sans to dissever."], [346, "308 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. Growing out of the turbulent condition of political feeling at this period, occurred a tragedy which even at this distant day cannot be recalled without the deepest pain. The duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, which re sulted in the death of the latter, cast a gloom over the whole country. To his friends and followers Hamilton's death seemed a martyrdom, and the unhappy author of this national calamity was pursued as a willful murderer ; indictments were found against him in New York and New Jersey, and such was the public feeling that he had to take temporary refuge in Georgia. But as an offset to these reminiscences may be recounted the cession of Louisiana by Spain to France in 1802, and the purchase of that valuable land by the United States in 1803. This year also witnessed the cession of an extended country by the friendly tribe of Kaskaskia Indians to the United States. This territory lay along the Mississippi, from the mouth of the Illinois to and up the Ohio, and is estimated as \"among the most fertile within our limits.\" By a treaty with the Indians at Fort Wayne, also, nearly two million acres of land were granted to the United States. So that, during Governor Page's administration, import ant acquisitions of territory were made to the whole country ; the United States set the first example to the world of oblig ing the Barbary powers to respect her flag by the force of arms, instead of a disgraceful tribute, and at home and abroad the power of the infant Republic was being sensibly felt. Virginia participated in the general prosperity, and peace and plenty reigned within her borders. Governor Page closed his administration as Governor December 1, 1805, after two successive annual re-elections, when, under the provisions of the State Constitution, not being eligible again until after an interval of four years, he was succeeded by Mr. William H. Cabell.

He died at Richmond, Virginia, October n, 1808, and was buried in St. John's churchyard, where a handsome monument marks his grave.

December i, 1805, to December 1, 1808. William H. Cabell, bom December 16, 1772, at \"Bos ton Hill,\" Cumberland County, Virginia, was the son of Nicholas Cabell, and grandson of Dr. William Cabell, a surgeon in the British Navy, who settled in Virginia in 1724. After enjoying the best educational advantages, he graduated in July, 1793, at William and Mary College, and then pursued the study of law in Richmond. He was elected to the General Assembly in 1796, from Amherst County, and was a member of that body in 1798, 1802, 1803, 1804, 1805, and on December 1, 1805, was elected Governor of Virginia, which office he filled for three years. An event which occurred in the administration of Governor Cabell has sen-ed to give that period an almost romantic interest. This was the trial of Aaron Burr, charged with treason against the government in an alleged design to found an empire in the western part of America. The trial was remarkable for the association in it of so many distinguished characters. It was a bitter contest, but, despite all the influ ence brought to bear, Burr escaped conviction. The verdict was, \"Aaron Burr is not proved to be guilty under the indictment by any evidence submitted to us.\" His oppo nents charged that he was a misguided, political intriguer, who had checked the soaring greatness of Hamilton and quenched that imperial soul ; that he had entered a paradise and filled the minds of Blennerhassett and his wife with dreams that chased the sweet sunshine of domestic felicity from their home, and made them wanderers and beggars upon earth ; that he was a"], [349, "WILLIAM H.

But his freedom, though legally won, was only in the seeming. His escape from conviction had been so narrow and his fears of further prosecution were so great, that, after remaining concealed for several weeks among his friends, he sailed for Europe under the name of G. H. Edwards. He remained in exile and poverty for several years, and finally, returning to America, died in obscurity and neglect in New York City. So ended the life of Aaron Burr \u2014 a life once full of golden promise. Endowed by nature with ability as a soldier and a statesman, his distinguished talents had carried him on the wave of popular favor almost to the chief magistracy of the Nation, a position which he failed to reach by only one vote. He served as Vice-President of the United States, and even while his love of country seemed above suspicion, Ambition led him, like Lucifer, to fall, and doomed him, like Lucifer, \" Never to hope again.\" Upon the expiration of Governor Cabell's term as chief executive of Virginia, he was elected by the Legislature a Judge of the General Court, December 15, 1808, and in April, 1S11, he was elected a Judge of the Court of Appeals. In this last office he acted until 1 85 1 , when he retired from the bench. He died at Richmond, Virginia, January 12, 1853, greatly beloved and widely lamented. The following extract from the resolutions of respect to his memory, by the Court of Appeals and the bar of Virginia, will testify to the unusual worth of this noble man. \"Resolved, That we cherish, and shall ever retain, a grateful remem brance of the signal excellence of the Honorable William H.

JOHN TYLER. Governor. December i, 1808, to January 11, 181 1. The ancestry of John Tyler is said to date from the Nor man Conquest, and he also claimed descent from the brave Wat Tyler, so celebrated in English history. His immedi ate progenitor, Henry Tyler, first appears in the records of Virginia, January 7, 1652, as a patentee of lands in James City County, and in 1699 the City of Williamsburg was laid off and established upon his land. Henry Tyler died in 1710, leaving two sons, Francis and John, the latter being the grandfather of Governor Tyler. John Tyler, the subject of this sketch, was born February 28, 1747. He was educated at William and Mary College, which institution he entered at eight years of age, and hav ing there graduated, he studied law for five years under the guidance of Robert Carter Nicholas. Being duly licensed, he practiced his profession for a time in James City, but in 1772 removed to Charles City County. In 1776, he married Mary Armistead, daughter of Robert Armistead. John Tyler was the friend and associate of Thomas Jeffer son, George Wythe, and Patrick Henry, and his soul burned with the same patriotic fires which kindled theirs. He was appointed by the Virginia Convention, July 5, 1776, one of the Judges of the High Court of Admiralty, and in 1778 he represented Charles City County in the House of Delegates, of which body he was Speaker from 1781 to 1786. In 1780 he was appointed a member of the Council of State ; in 1786 was again appointed a Judge of the Court of Admiralty, and was consequently a member of the first Court of Appeals of the State. He was appointed a Judge of the General Court XXI 313"], [352, "314 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. in 1788, and served in this capacity until December 1, 1808, when he was elected Governor of Virginia. This year of 1808 was notable from the fact that the im portation of Africans into the United States ceased by law on the 1st of January \u2014 a circumstance to be remembered, as is every step that has been taken by the government upon this interesting subject, so vitally interwoven with the political, industrial, and domestic life of one section of the country. As an evidence of the wonderful advance of the United States in growth and prosperity, it is stated that in 18 10 the number of newspapers printed in the Union was estimated at upwards of twenty- two million, and the number of mills for manufacturing paper at about 180. These figures are given upon unquestionable authority and are an astonishing proof of the vigorous life of the new republic. Governor Tyler's administration as chief executive of Virginia was highly satisfactory, and in public and private he won the warm regard of his associates. He was simple in his manners, distinguished for the uprightness and fidelity with which he discharged his official duties, and enjoyed in an uncommon degree the esteem and confidence of his fellow citizens. Upon the expiration of his term as Governor, John Tyler was called by the appointment of Mr. Madison to the Judge ship of the District Court of the United States for Virginia, which office he held until his death, at his seat, \"Greenway,\" in Charles City County, January 6, 1813.

JAMES MONROE. Governor. January n, 1811, to November 25, 1S11. James Monroe became Governor of Virginia for the second time, in 181 1, when he was in the same year called to a seat as Secretary of State in the Cabinet of President Madison. An extended sketch of President Monroe's life having been already given, we will only allude to the period when he was for the second time chief executive in his native state. The country was at this time sweeping rapidly into a war with Great Britain, the extent, duration, and character of whose injuries to American rights rendered an appeal to arms the only means of redress. The report of the Committee on Foreign Relations, made November 29, 181 1, will explain the grievances of the country, which could only be settled by a resort to \"the extreme measure.\" After recounting various wrongs and offences on the part of England, the report continues: \"To svtm up, irr a word, the great cause of complaint against Great Britain, your committee need only say, that the United States, as a sover eign and independent power, claim the right to use the ocean, which is the common and acknowledged highway of nations, for the purposes of transporting, in their own vessels, the products of their own soils and the acquisitions of their own industry to a market in the ports of friendly nations, and to bring home, in return, such articles as their necessities or convenience may require, always regarding the rights of belligerents as defined by the established law of nations.

To wrongs so daring in character and so disgraceful in their exe cution, it is impossible that the people of the United States should remain indifferent. We must now tamely and quietly submit, or we must resist by those means which God has placed within our reach. Your committee would not cast a shade over the American name by the expression of a doubt which branch of this alternative will be embraced. The occasion is now presented when the national character, misunderstood and traduced for a time by foreign and domestic enemies, should be vindicated. If we have not rushed to the field of battle like the nations who are led by the mad ambition of a single chief in the avarice of a corrupted court, it has not proceeded from the fear of war, but from our love of justice and humanity. That proud spirit of liberty and independence which sus tained our fathers in the successful assertion of rights against foreign aggression, is not yet sunk. The patriotic fire of the Revolution still lives in the American breast with a holy and unextinguishable flame, and will conduct this nation to those high destinies which are not less the reward of dignified moderation than of exalted valor. But, we have borne with injury until forbearance has ceased to be a virtue. The sovereignty and independence of these states, purchased and sanctified by the blood of our fathers, from whom we received them, not for ourselves^nly, but as the inheritance of our posterity, are deliberately and systematically violated. And the period has arrived when, in the opinion of your committee, it is the sacred duty of Congress to call forth the patriotism and resources of the country. By the aid of these, and with the blessing of God, we confi dently trust we shall be able to procure that redress which has been sought for by justice, by remonstrance, and forbearance, in vain.\" The several state Legislatures began to place the militia on a war footing, and Virginia, with the rest, pledged her support to the general government, whatever means of resistance it should adopt. It was in such an hour of anxiety that James Monroe was called by the President of the United States to sit in solemn council upon the welfare of the nation. Yielding his high position as Governor of Virginia, he acknowledged the superior claim of obligation to his whole country, and on November 25, 181 1, became Secretary of State in the Cabinet of President Madison. This office he held until the close of President Madison's second term, with the exception of about six months, when he discharged the more arduous duties of Secretary of the War Department. A few years later the Old Dominion, which had already"], [355, "JAMES MONROE. 317 supplied the presidential chair for twenty-four years out of twenty-eight, again sent another honored son to fill that lofty station.

George William Smith is believed to have been descended from Major Lawrence Smith, of early colonial dis tinction, while his immediate progenitor was Merewether Smith, who was born about the year 1730, at the family seat, \"Bathurst,\" in Essex County, Virginia. Merewether Smith was an ardent patriot, and figured as such, from 1766 until 1790, in many important stations during that eventful period. He married first in 1760, Alice, daughter of Philip Lee (third in descent from the emigrant, Richard Lee), and their son, George William Smith, was born at \"Bathurst\" in 1762. This latter, the subject of the present sketch, was married February 7, 1793, to Sarah, daughter of Colonel Richard Adams, one of the most patri otic and influential citizens of the City of Richmond. George William Smith represented the County of Essex in the House of Delegates in 1794, after which he entered upon a lucrative practice of law in Richmond, taking a high rank in his profession. He was elected from this city to the Legislature, from 1802 until 1808, and in 18 10 was appointed a member of the State Council. As senior member of that body, or Lieutenant-Governor, upon the resignation of Gov ernor James Monroe, he succeeded him, November 25, 181 1, as the chief executive of the state. But Governor Smith's term of office was short, and his career painfully ended by the memorable calamity of the"], [357, "GEORGE WILLIAM SMITH. 319 burning of the Richmond theatre. This harrowing event took place on Thursday night, December 26, 181 1. The theatre was crowded with the young, the gay, the fair, together with the honored and the influential of the state, and the terrible ending of the evening shrouded Richmond in mourning. The Governor had reached a place of safety outside the burning building, but returning to rescue his little son, who had been separated from him by the throng, he fell a victim to the sacrificial passion of a parent's love. Seventy persons are known to have perished in this horrible holocaust, but it was thought that many more were reckoned among the fated in that ill-starred audience. On the 30th of December intelligence of this tragedy was communicated to the Senate of the United States, and a reso lution was adopted that the Senators should wear crape on the left arm for a month.

PEYTON RANDOLPH. Senior Member of Council of State, and AFling Governor. December 26, 181 1, to January 3, 1812. Upon the untimely death of Governor George William Smith, the duties of the executive chair fell for a season upon Peyton Randolph, then the senior member of the Coun cil of State. Peyton Randolph was the son of Governor Edmund Ran dolph, and inherited the genius of a distinguished ancestry. He graduated at William and Mary College in 1798, and soon took an acknowledged prominence in his chosen profes sion of law. He presided over the Councils of Virginia for only a brief period, as on January 3, 1812, James Barbour, of Orange County, was chosen by the General Assembly as Governor. In 182 1 Peyton Randolph was selected as the Reporter of the Supreme Court of Virginia, and his labors in this depart ment are embraced in six volumes, entitled, \" Report of Cases Argued and Determined in the Court of Appeals of Virginia, 1821-1828.\" But in the midst of increasing usefulness and brilliant prospects, Peyton Randolph's career was terminated in the prime of manhood. A victim to pulmonary disease, he passed too soon from the arena he had adorned, widely lamented by many to whom his virtues and his talents had endeared him. His contribution to the Law Reports of his native state, is a permanent memorial of his ability, and constitutes an important part of the legal literature of Virginia."], [359, "321 LXXXVII. JAMES BARBOUR. Governor. January 3, 1812, to December 1, 1814. Governor James Barbour was the son of Thomas Barbour, who had been a member of the House of Burgesses in 1769, when it issued the first protest against the Stamp Act, and was also, in 1775, a member of the \" Committee of Public Safety\" of Orange County. The father of Thomas was James Barbour, who appears as a grantee of lands in St. George's parish, Spottsylvania County, June 26, 1731, and again in 1733, of lands in St. Mark's parish in the same county. He was one of the first vestrymen of this latter parish at its organization at Germanna in 1731, and served in that office until the division of the parish in 1740, which threw him into the new parish of St. Thomas, in Orange County, in which division he lived. So that, James Barbour, his grandson, and the subject of this notice, was born in Orange County, June 10, 1775. While very young he served as a Deputy-Sheriff, and at the age' of nineteen was admitted to the bar. His means of education had not been ample, but for a time he enjoyed the instruction of James Waddell, the blind preacher. Perhaps the seed sown in good ground by this \"mute, inglorious Milton\" may have blossomed into the virtues and talents which adorned the character of James Barbour. At this point it may be a pardonable digression to lay before the reader the beautiful tribute paid to James Waddell, by William Wirt, one of Virginia's most gifted sons: \"It was one Sunday, as I travelled through the County of Orange, that my eye was caught by a cluster of horses, tied near a ruinous, old, wooderr house, in the sorest, not far from the roadside. Having frequently seen"], [360, "THE GOVERNORS OF V1RG/N/A. 322 such objects before, in travelling through these states, I had no difficulty in understanding that this was a place of religious worship. \" Devotion alone should have stopped me to join in the duties of the congregation, but I must confess that curiosity to hear the preacher of such a wilderness, was not the least of my motives. On entering I was struck with his preternatural appearance ; he was a tall and very spare old man ; his head, which was covered with a white linen cap, his shrivelled hands, and his voice, were all shaking under the influence of a palsy; and a few moments ascertained to me that he was perfectly blind. \"The first emotions which touched my breast were those of mingled pity and veneration. But ah! sacred God! how soon were all my feelings changed! The lips of Plato were never more worthy of a prognostic swarm of bees, than were the lips of this holy man ! It was a day of the administration of the sacrament ; and his subject, of course, was the pas sion of our Saviour. I had heard the subject handled a thousand times ; I had thought it exhausted long ago. Little did I suppose, that in the wild woods of America, I was to meet with a man whose eloquence would give to this topic a new and more sublime pathos than I had ever before witnessed. \"As he descended from the pulpit, to distribute the mystic symbols, there was a peculiar, a more than human, solemnity in his air and manner, which made my blood run cold, and my whole frame shiver. \"He then drew a picture of the sufferings of our Saviour ; his trial before Pilate, his ascent up Calvary, his crucifixion, and his death. I knew the whole history, but never, until then, had I heard the circum stances so selected, so arranged, so colored ! It was all new ; and I seemed to have heard it for the first time in my life. His enunciation was so deliberate, that his voice trembled on every syllable ; and every heart in the assenrbly trembled in unison. His peculiar phrases had that force of description, that the original scene appeared to be, at that moment, acting before our eyes. We saw the very faces of the Jews ; the staring, frightful distortions of malice and rage. We saw the buffet ; my soul kindled with a flame of indignation, and nry hands were involuntarily and convulsively clinched. \"But wheu he came to touch on the patience, the forgiving meekness of our Saviour; when he drew, to the life, his blessed eyes streaming iir tears to heaven ; his voice breathing to God a soft and gentle prayer Of pardon on his enemies, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do '\u2014the voice of the preacher, which had all along faltered, grew fainter and fainter, until his utterance being entirely obstructed by the force of his feelings, he raised his handkerchief to his eyes, and burst into a loud and irrepressible flood of grief. The effect is inconceivable. The whole house resounded with the mingled groans, and sobs, and shrieks of the congregation. It was some time before the turrrult had subsided so far as to pernrit him to proceed. Indeed, judging by the usual, but fallacious"], [361, "JAMES BARBOUR. 323 standard of my own weakness, I began to be very uneasy for the situation of the preacher. For I could not conceive how he would be able to let his audience down from the height to which he had wound them, without impairing the solemnity and dignity of his subject, or perhaps shocking them by the abruptness of the fall. But no ; the descent was as beautiful aud sublime as the elevation had been rapid and enthusiastic. The first sentence with which he broke the awful silence, was a quotation from Rousseau, ' Socrates died like a philosopher, but Jesus Christ like a God.' \" I despair of giving you any idea of the effect produced by this short sentence, unless you could perfectly conceive the whole manner of the man, as well as the peculiar crisis in the discourse. Never before did I completely understand what Demosthenes meant by laying such stress on delivery. You are to bring before you the venerable figure of the preacher ; his blindness, constantly recalling to your recollection old Homer, Ossian, and Milton, and associating with his performance the melancholy grand eur of their geniuses; you are to imagine that you hear his slow, solemn, well-accented enunciation, and his voice of affecting, trerrrbling melody ; you are to remember the pitch of passion and enthusiasm to which the congregation were raised; and then, the few minutes of portentous, death-like silence which reigned throughout the house ; the preacher removing his white handkerchief from his aged face (even yet wet from the recent torrent of his tears), and slowly stretching forth the palsied hand which holds it, begins the sentence, ' Socrates died like a philosopher ' \u2014 then pausing, raising his other hand, pressing them both clasped together with warmth and energy to his breast, lifting his ' sighUess balls ' to heaven, and pouring his whole soul into his tremulous voice \u2014 'but Jesus Christ \u2014 like a God ! ' If he had been indeed and in truth an angel of light, the effect could scarcely have been more divine. \"Whatever I had been able to conceive of the sublimity of Massillon, or the force of Bourdaloue, had fallen far short of the power which I felt from the delivery of this simple sentence. The blood, which just before had rushed in a hurricane upon my brain, and in the violence and agony of my feelings had held my whole system in suspense, now ran back into my heart, with a sensation which I cannot describe \u2014 a kind of shuddering, delicious horror. The paroxysm of blended pity and indignation, to which I had been transported, subsided into the deepest self-abasement, humility, and adoration. I had just been lacerated and dissolved by sympathy, for our Saviour as a fellow-creature ; but now, with fear and trembling, I adored him as 'a God.' \"If this description give you the impression that this incomparable minister had anything of shallow, theatrical trick in his manner, it does him great injustice. I have never seen, in any other orator, such a union of simplicity and majesty. He has not a gesture, an attitude, or an accent, to which he does not seem forced by the sentiment which he is expressing. His mind is too serious, too earnest, too solicitous, and, at the same time,"], [362, "324 THE GOVERNORS OF V/RG/N/A. too dignified, to stoop to artifice.

A thousand times, as I rode along, I dropped the reins of nry bridle, stretched forth my hand and tried to imitate his quotation from Rousseau ; a thous and times I abandoned the attempt in despair, and felt persuaded that his peculiar manner and power arose from an energy of soul, which nature could give, but which no human being could justly copy.

His administration was specially patriotic and important, occurring as it did, during the second war with Great Britain, a period calculated to develop the nerve and ability of men in authority, and to test the strength of leaders in civil and military affairs. James Barbour is said to have pledged his personal means to sustain the credit of his state, and by his vigilant and able conduct of affairs nobly maintained the honor of Virginia, who acted well her part in this second struggle with Old England. In 18 15 Mr. Barbour was elected by the Virginia Assem bly to the United States Senate, where he served continuously for ten years. In this body he took a conspicuous position, and was chairman of some most important committees. In 1825 he became a member of the Cabinet of President John Quincy Adams, and served as Secretary of War until 1828, when he was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipo tentiary to Great Britain. His ability, experience, and great natural gifts of manner and personal magnetism, rendered him peculiarly fitted for this responsible position. In 1829 he returned to America and retired to the repose of private life, not, however, without taking an active interest in the political affairs of the country.

He was born January 31, 1761, in Williamsburg, Virginia, and was educated at William and Mary College, which institution he left at the age of eighteen years, to enter the army. His ability as a soldier met with deserved recognition, and he was the commander of Washington's life-guard until it was disbanded in 1783, when he settled in Albemarle County, on his estate called \"Warren.\" In the same year he married Margaret, daughter of John Smith, of Baltimore, Maryland. The public services of Mr. Nicholas began in 1784, as the representative of Albemarle County in the House of Dele gates of Virginia.

In 1806, he declined a special mission to France, but, in 1807 he was elected to Congress, and again in 1809, was re-elected to the same position. During this exciting and momentous period he took the highly patriotic stand of a determined and, if need be, armed resistance to the policy of France and Great Britain. In December, 1814, Mr. Nicholas was elected Governor of Vir ginia, and although the State at that time was passing through the great ordeal of a foreign war under peculiarly trying cir cumstances, he did not hesitate to accept the position with its unusual weight of care and anxiety. The announcement of peace in the following spring light ened his responsibilities, and he at once turned his energies to the promotion of matters of internal improvement. In every situation, Governor Nicholas showed himself devoted to the honor and welfare of his native state, combining with his zeal an intimate knowledge of her capacities and her needs. In the spring of 18 19, retiring permanently from public life, he returned to his country seat, \"Warren,\" but his health had been seriously impaired by the fatigue and anxiety incident to many positions of responsibility, and his useful life was drawing near its close. Being advised to try the benefits of a journey on horse back, he set out and reached \"Tufton,\" the residence of his son-in-law, Thomas Jefferson Randolph. Here his strength failed, and he expired suddenly on October 10, 1820.

PRESTON Governor. December i, 1816, to December 1, 18 19 The Preston family of Virginia was originally from Lon donderry, Ireland, where John Preston, its founder in the New World, married Elizabeth Patton, and emigrated to Virginia in the summer of 1735. He settled in that portion of Orange County from which Augusta County was erected in 1738. Elizabeth Patton was the sister of Colonel Patton, who was distinguished in the early annals of the Colony as a man of property, enterprise, and influence. He, like many of the pioneer settlers, fell a victim to Indian warfare and was killed at Smithfield, Virginia, in 1753. John Preston first settled at \" Spring Hill,\" but in 1743 he purchased a tract of land near Staunton, and died soon after. William, his third child, married Susanna, daughter of Francis Smith, of Hanover County, Virginia, a member of the House of Burgesses and a prominent patriot in the Amer ican Revolution. The eighth child of WTilliam and Susanna Preston, viz., James Patton Preston, is the subject of this sketch. He was born at Smithfield, June 21, 1774, and enjoyed early advan tages of education, being a student at William and Mary College from 1790- 1795. In 1802 he was elected to the State Senate of Virginia, was appointed Lieutenant- Colonel of the 12th Infantry, United States Army, March 19, 1812, and for gallantry was promoted, August 15, 18 13, to the rank of Colonel and assigned to the command of the 23d Regiment of Infantry.

But Virginia did not wait to crown her gallant son with tardy recognition of his valor. Upon the conclusion of peace with Great Britain, James Patton Preston, in remembrance of his patriotic services and as a tribute to his known ability, was elected by the General Assembly, Governor of his native state. He served in this capacity until December 1, 1819. It is a matter of interest to note, that in the last year of Governor Preston's incumbency, the law was passed establishing the University of Virginia in Albemarle County, and also that in 18 19 a revision of the Code of Virginia was made: Subsequent to his gubernatorial service. Mr. Preston was for several years postmaster of the City of Richmond, after which he retired to his estate, \" Smithfield,\" in Mont gomery County, where he died May 4, 1843. He married Ann Taylor, daughter of Robert Taylor, of Norfolk, and has left distinguished descendants : in fact, it is claimed that few American families have numbered so many honored repre sentatives as the Preston family of Virginia, with its collateral branches and alliances.

December i, 1819, to December 1, 1822. Thomas Mann Randolph was the eldest son of Thomas Mann and Anne (Cary) Randolph. He was born at \" Tuck ahoe,\" the family seat, in Goochland County, Virginia, in the year 1768, and was destined to become a distinguished member of an already prominent family, founded in Vir ginia by William Randolph of \" Turkey Island.\" Thomas Mann Randolph, having enjoyed the advantages of a course of instruction at William and Mary College, had the further benefit of completing his education at the Univer sity of Edinburgh, so that he entered upon the grave duties of life with an unusual preparation for its responsibilities. He married Martha Jefferson, daughter of Thomas Jefferson, at Monticello, February 23, 1790, and settled first at \"Varina,\" an estate long in possession of the Randolph family, in Henrico County, a few miles below Richmond. He served as a mem ber of the Virginia Senate in 1793 and 1794, but removed soon after this period to \"Edge Hill,\" Albemarle County, where he continued to reside until 1808, when his family became domesticated with Mr. Jefferson at Monticello. Mr. Randolph represented Virginia in the United States Congress from 1803 to 1807, when he withdrew for a time from public life and devoted himself to agricultural pursuits. During the war of 1812, Mr. Randolph's ardent patriotism was conspicuous. He raised a command and gallantly par ticipated in the engagements of the sea-board, and was soon promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and placed in command of the 1st Light Corps. On the 20th March, 1813, he became Colonel of the 20th United States Infantry, and"], [369, "THOMAS MANN RANDOLPH. 331 performed valuable service on the Canada line.

This office he filled by annual re-election until December 1, 1822, when he returned to private pursuits. He died at \" Monticello,\" June 20, 1828, aged sixty years. Among the matters of general interest occurring during the years 1819 to 1822, may be noted the admission of Ala bama territory, as a state, into the Union, and the erection of Arkansas territory into a territorial government, by an act of Congress. During the year 18 19 the Supreme Court of the United States decided a case of great importance to the literary and charitable institutions of our country. Its decision was : ' ' That the Charter granted by the British Crown to the Trustees of Dartmouth College, in 1769, is a contract within the meaning of that clause of the Constitution of the United States which declares that no state shall make any law impairing the obligation of contracts ; That the Charter was not dissolved by the Revolution ; and, That an act of the State Legislature of New Hampshire, altering the Charter without the consent of the Corporation, in a material respect, is an act inrpairing the obligation of the Charter, and is unconstitutional and void.\" The year 1820 completed the second century since the settlement of New England, and the commemoration of the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers was celebrated at Plymouth, December 22, attended by a vast concourse of people. Daniel Webster delivered an address with thrilling effect. \" By ascending,\" said the orator, \" to an association with our ances tors; by contemplating their example, and studying their character; hy partaking their sentiments, and imbibing their spirit ; by accompanying them in their toils, by sympathizing in their sufferings, and rejoicing in their successes and their triumphs, we mingle our own existence with theirs and seem to belong to their age.

What has been the progress since that time? The river has not only become the property of the United States front its source to the ocean, with all its tributary streams (with the exception of the upper part of the Red River only), but, Louisiana, with a fair and liberal boundary, on the western side, and the Floridas on the eastern, have been ceded to us.

The year of 1822 is memorable as the date of the incorpo ration of the City of Boston, a place whose historic interest reaches as far back as 1630 ; whose power today as a com mercial and political centre in a great country is unquestioned, and whose influence as a literary capital stands unrivaled in the land. In reviewing thus briefly these matters of general interest occurring in the United States during Thomas Mann Ran dolph's administration in Virginia, we behold the Old Dominion still powerful in the councils of the nation, and see one of her chosen sons occupying the highest office in the gift of the American people. Perhaps no Act passed by the General Assembly of Virginia (when Governor Ran dolph was the chief executive of the state), is of more pres ent interest than the following : \"AN ACT ceding to the United States the lands on Old Point Comfort, and the shoal called the Rip Raps. \"Passed March 1st, 1821. \"Whereas it is shewn to the present General Assembly, that the gov ernment of the United States is solicitous that certain lands at Old Point Comfort, and at the shoal called the Rip Raps, should be, with the right of property and entire jurisdiction thereon, vested in the said United States for the purpose of fortification, and other objects of national defence,"], [371, "THOMAS MANN RANDOLPH. 333 \" I.

After receiving a good education he embraced the profession of law, and entered upon its practice with a zeal and ability that were attended with marked suc cess. The long periods for which he held the public offices to which he was subsequently chosen, are the best evidences of his popularity. In 1796 he was elected to represent Goochland County in the Virginia House of Delegates, and in 1803 he was chosen Clerk of that body. For seven years he filled this position most acceptably, when he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, and here he remained until 18 19, in faithful and efficient service. On December 1, 1822, he was chosen by the General Assembly the Governor of Virginia, and occupied that station by annual re-election until by the Constitution he was no longer eligible.

Leaving college, he now devoted himself to the study of law, in which he made such rapid progress that at the age of nineteen he appeared at the bar of his native county as a practicing lawyer. His success was now unqualified, and his popularity evinced by an early summons to public office. In December, 181 1, he represented Charles City County in the House of Del egates, and was re-elected for five successive years. In 1816 he was elected to the United States Congress, and was here twice re-elected.

He inarched with his command to the lakes of Canada in August following, and efficiently served there under the command successively of Generals Smyth and Van Rensselaer. On 12th March, 18 13, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel of the 20th Regiment, United States Army, and participated in the trying campaigns of that regiment on the St. Lawrence and towards Lake Champlain. The exposure which Colonel Campbell here suffered seriously impaired his health, and in consequence, on January 28, 18 14, he was compelled to resign his commission. Returning home he soon entered the service of Virginia as Aide-de-Camp to Governor Barbour, and gave valuable assistance in organ izing the Militia force, called into service in the neighborhood of Richmond and Petersburg, in the summer of 1814. In the session of the Virginia Assembly of 18 14-15, a law was passed for raising 10,000 troops, and under it Colonel Camp bell was elected General of the 3d Brigade. On the 25th January, he was appointed Colonel of the 3d Virginia Cavalry, but was afterwards transferred to the 5th Regiment of Cav alry. Upon his return to Abingdon, Virginia, he again entered the clerk's office, where he continued until 1820, when he was elected to the Senate of Virginia. In 1824, he was elected clerk of the County Court of Washington County, and held this office until 1836, when he became Governor of Virginia.

March, 1840, to March, 1841. Thomas Walker Gilmer, son of George Gilmer, was born at \" Gilmerton,\" his father's seat, in Albemarle County, Virginia, April 6, 1802. The founder of the Gilmer family in Virginia, Dr. George Gilmer, was a native of Scotland and a graduate of the University of Edinburgh. Early in the 18th century he migrated to America and settled in Williamsburg, Virginia, where for fifty years he successfully combined the professions of physician, surgeon, and druggist. He married three times, each time into a family of high position, and died leaving to his numerous descendants a truly honored name. His great-grandson, Thomas Walker Gilmer, began life under very favorable auspices, receiving an extensive education from tutors and at private schools. Later he enjoyed the instruc- tion and training of two very intellectual uncles, and when he began the study of law his progress was rapid and sub- stantial. Entering upon his chosen profession, he was for a time allured to the growing West, tempted by the wider field there offered to aspiring industry and talent. He remained for a season in St. Louis, Missouri, where flattering prospects spread before him, but, finding his presence missed at home, he returned to the bosom of his family. In this step he was influenced by a noble desire to aid those he loved best, by his own personal exertions. He soon took a high position at the bar in Charlottesville and in the adjacent counties, and became at once prominent in the discussion of the legal and political questions of the day. During the canvass which resulted in the election of Gen eral Andrew Jackson to his first term as President, Mr. 849"], [388, "350 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. Gilmer was one of the editors of the \"Virginia Advocate,\" a newspaper published in Charlottesville and devoted to the interests of General Jackson. He also contributed to other newspapers and acquired a fine reputation as a writer. In the spring of 1829 Mr. Gilmer was sent by the County of Albemarle to the Virginia House of Delegates, and at the expiration of his first term was returned by an increased majority to this position. In 1831 Governor John Floyd appointed him Commissioner of the State to prosecute the Revolutionary claims of Virginia against the United States. In the spring of 1832 Mr. Gilmer was again elected to the House of Delegates, and re-elected thereto in 1833, 1835, and 1838. His time when not engaged in legislative duties was spent in traveling through the United States and contributing valuable papers to leading journals upon the various States with which he thus became familiar. In 1838 he was made Speaker of the House of Delegates, and was re-elected to this body in 1839. On February 14, 1840, he was elected Governor of Virginia, to take the executive chair on the fol lowing 31st of March. Governor Gilmer entered upon his new duties with the zeal natural to him. Being deeply interested in the material development of Virginia, he made a careful personal inspec tion of nearly all the important public works of the state. This tour gave him the information necessary to an able elucidation of the subject which he laid before the General Assembly soon after. He had now to meet a complicated and irritating question with Governor Seward, of New York, relative to the surrender of some men (charged with slave stealing in Virginia) who were fugitives from justice. Gover nor Gilmer demanded their unconditional surrender, deeming the refusal to do so a palpable and dangerous violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States. (See Resolutions of General Assembly of Virginia. Adopted March 17, 1840.) But New York did not respond to the demand, and the Leg islature of Virginia receding from its position failed to sustain Governor Gilmer. Dissatisfied at this want of har mony and proper co-operation, Governor Gilmer sent in his"], [389, "THOMAS WALKER G/LMER. 351 resignation. Feeling ran high in the Legislature, and they were unable to elect a successor, so the body adjourned, leaving the office of Governor to be filled by the Senior Coun cillor of State, as provided by law.

Governor Gilmer now offered himself as a candidate for Congress from the Albemarle district, and was elected by a handsome majority, taking his seat in the Congress which had been convened by the proclamation of President Harri son, dated March 17th. Mr. Gilmer, in this new field of activity, labored zealously for reform and retrenchment, and was placed at the head of the important Standing Committee of Ways and Means. In 1843 he was re-elected to Congress, and on February 15th, 1844, was nominated by President Tyler to be Secretary of the Navy. The nomination was unanimously confirmed and Mr. Gilmer entered upon the discharge of his duties with accustomed industry. But his labors were soon terminated by his tragic end in the catas trophe on the steamer Princeton, February 28, 1844. He died in the forty-second year of his age, \" stricken down on the very harvest-field of his faithful labors, and with the sheaves of gathered honors standing thick around him.\" He had married Miss Ann E.

He was the descendant of early settlers in the Colony, and his progenitors had borne honorable part in the War of the Revolution, his grandfather having been killed in action on the Jersey line, at a place called Quibbleton. John Munford Gregory's early education was, after the rudiments acquired at an \"old field\" school, pretty much self-education. He taught himself, and learned at the same time the important lesson of the dignity of labor. As a farm hand he had his toil sweetened by aspirations of a higher life, and removing to James City County, began his upward course by teaching. He then pursued the study of law, and entered William and Mary College, from which institu tion he graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Law in 1830.

Having enjoyed peculiar advantages in elementary instruction, he entered Washington College, then attended Yale, and finally completed his edu cation at Princeton, New Jersey, from which college he graduated as Master of Arts in 18 16. So pleased was young McDowell's father with his son's success at college, that upon his return home he presented him with a valuable tract of land, about 2500 acres, in Bourbon County, Kentucky. In September, 1818, James McDowell married his cousin, Susan Preston, and removed to his plantation in Kentucky, but, his father's health sailing about this time, he returned to Virginia and settled on a farm in the neighborhood of Lexington.

Here he received his first instruction in the \"old field\" schools, around which primitive cradles of learning so much romantic interest now settles. Later, young Smith enjoyed tuition in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and Plainfield, Connecticut, and subsequently was sent to a classical school at \" Wingfield,\" Hanover County, Virginia. Adopting the profession of law, William Smith obtained his license and qualified in the Court of Culpeper County, August, 1819. His ardor and ability soon gained for him success, and his taste for politics opened a wide field for his ambitious spirit. In 1836 he was elected to the Virginia State Senate, and served through the term of four years ; was re-elected, but resigned after serving one session. Early in Mr. Smith's public career he had been convinced of the necessity for improved mail, facilities in Virginia and the South. In 1827 he obtained from the United States government a contract for carrying the mails once a week from Fairfax Court House to Warrenton, and thence to Cul peper Court House. This contract was renewed in 183 1, and led to the establishment, in four years, of a daily four-horse post-coach line from Washington City to Milledgeville, Georgia.

This new country of the golden fleece was drawing men from every quarter of the globe, and thither Governor Smith now (1850) turned his steps. He engaged at once in the practice of his profession in San Francisco, was returned by that city as its delegate to the Constitutional Convention which met at Beni cia in the fall of 1850, and was unanimously elected the permanent President of that body. In the State Assembly which convened soon after, Governor Smith was nominated for United States Senator, but was not elected. In 1852 he determined to return to Virginia, bringing a handsome addi tion to his means and increased reputation as the result of a two years' residence upon the Pacific slope. In May, 1853, Governor Smith was elected to Congress from Virginia, and served in this body by successive re-election until March 4, 1861. At this period, the late war between the sections was approaching, and Governor Smith, though in his sixty fourth year, entered the army in the Southern cause.

Receiv ing his early education through private tutors, he entered the College of South Carolina, from which institution he graduated in 1826. Choosing law as his profession, he was admitted to the bar in 1828, and commenced practice in his native county. In 1836 he removed to Helena, Arkansas, where for three years he practiced his profession successfully, but in 1839 he determined to return to Virginia and locate in Washington County.

In reviewing the career of Joseph Johnson, the triumph of natural ability and lofty character over the inauspicious circumstances of his early life is very striking. He was born in New York, but moved with his family to Harrison County, Virginia, at the age of fifteen years. Here he was the sup port of his widowed mother and younger brother, with no advantages for learning other than his own self-help. Grad ually his industry and probity won their way, and he became' first, employee, then manager, and finally the son-in-law of a respectable farmer in the neighborhood where he lived. In the end he purchased the estate of his former patron, and the place continued to be his home until the close of his life. Mr. Johnson was eminently a self-made man, and his education, the result of solitary study by night and a contin uous application of his powers in the search for knowledge. In a debating society which he originated in a village near his home, he developed ability as a thinker and a speaker, but it was as the Captain of a Rifle Company (when the Atlantic sea-board was threatened in 18 14, and he with his command were ordered to Norfolk) that he first came into public notice. From this time on, Mr. Johnson's long and active life was replete with gathering honors and usefulness. In 18 18 he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, and again in 1822, declining re-election at the expiration of this last term. In 1823, he was sent to Congress, and in 1845, was elected to that body for the seventh time. At the close of the 29th Congress, in 1847, Mr. Johnson issued an address to his constituents, thanking them for their past con-"], [404, "366 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. fidence, and expressing his wish to retire permanently from public life. But the people could not spare him yet, and he was returned to the House of Delegates, where he served in the session of 1847-48. In 1850 he was elected a member of the State Constitutional Convention, and whilst a member of that body was chosen by the Legislature, Governor of Vir ginia, under the provisions of the then existing Constitution. In the fall of 1851, the Constitution which he had helped to frame was adopted, and under its articles Mr. Johnson, who had been nominated by the Democratic party, was elected Governor, by the popular vote, for the term of four years from January 1, 1852. This was the first election of a Governor of Virginia by the votes of the people. Governor Johnson's administration was popular and suc cessful, his attention being specially directed to the internal development of the state, and to the establishment of a general railroad system throughout Virginia. He justly regarded this latter method as the promptest and most efficient means to vitalize the abundant resources of the Old Dominion. Upon the expiration of his gubernatorial term, Governor Johnson finally retired to private life, enjoying in the evening of his days, the comforts of a happy home enlivened by his family and friends. When the period of the late war between the States drew on, Mr. Johnson was called upon to give his views to his fel low-citizens. This he did. Always loving the Union, he had counselled moderation and patience, but when the issue came, he advised his people to stand by their section. Governor Johnson died in the 92d year of his age, on February 27, 1877, regretted as a man whose talents, firmness of character, and unsullied integrity had won in no common measure the esteem of his fellowmen.

The distant territory of Kansas had lately become the battle ground of freedom and slavery, and this conflict, in that sec tion, was sought by some to be transferred to Virginia soil. John Brown, whose exploits in Kansas had made him already notorious, now formed a plan to strike a death-blow to slavery in the very heart of a slave-holding state. It was towards the close of Governor Wise's administration that the seizure of the arsenal at Harper's Ferry, Virginia, was attempted by John Brown and his few associates. The final object of the effort was to free the slaves, but, the undertaking failed and Brown met his fate upon the gallows, December 2, 1859. This was the opening scene in a great drama, whose consummation was at Appomatox Court House, in April, 1865. Between these two points of time lies written the history of a bloody war. Of the Convention which met at Richmond, Virginia, February 13, 1861 (to consider the relations of Virginia to the Federal Government), Governor Wise was a prominent member, and as soon as his State severed her allegiance from the central government, Governor Wise offered his services to his country in the field of battle. He was at once made Brigadier-General in the Confederate Army, and entered upon a distinguished career as a soldier. From the begin ning to the close of the four years' war, \"Wise's Legion\" was in active, military service, and won for itself a highly honorable record. After the close of the war, General Wise engaged in the practice of law in the City of Richmond until his death, which occurred on September 14, 1876. He was a man of great energy, original and vigorous as a thinker, independent as an actor, and brilliant and persuasive as a speaker ; a man of lofty principles and unsullied life, who gathered honors in every de partment of activity to which he directed his unusual powers of mind and character. He left several children, but his name is also perpetuated in a county in Virginia named after him."], [407, "369 CVII. JOHN LETCHER. Governor. January i, 1860, to January 1, 1864. John Letcher was born in Lexington, Virginia, March 29, 1813, of parents descended from Welsh on the one side, and Scotch-Irish on the other; a staunch and sterling stock, whose virtues were well developed in the subject of this sketch. John Letcher was not sent to school in early life, but began his career as a son of toil, beneath whose humble garb beat a soul eager to acquire knowledge. At the age of fifteen years we see him working at the trade of a tailor, studying at every leisure hour, and hoarding his hard-earned savings to help him to the goal of his ambition. But, not until after he was twenty -one did he have the satisfaction of entering college. At this period he became a student at Washington College, Lexington, and drank deeply of the sources of information there laid open to him. Deciding upon the profession of law, he applied himself to its study, and entered upon its practice in 1839, in his native town. His ability and steadfastness soon won success, and with success, came friends. He established at this time, at Lexington, \" The Valley Star,\" and edited it ably in the advocacy of Democratic principles and the cause of education. In his profession he rose rapidly, and in the political questions agitating Virginia he took a leading part. In 1848 Mr. Letcher served as Presidential Elector on the Democratic ticket, and when the Convention of 1850 was called to remodel the State Constitution, he was returned to that body by a large majority, although his district was strongly Whig. In 1851 he was elected to Congress, and"], [408, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 370 continued to serve there for four successive terms. It was here that, by his rigid adherence to principles of moderation in expenditure and fidelity to the best interests of the people, he obtained the soubriquet, \"Honest John Letcher, the watch-dog of the Treasury\" \u2014 a distinction which accompa nied him throughout his chequered career. Being elected Governor of Virginia in 1859, he took his seat on January 1, 1860, and became Chief Executive at one of the most trying periods of national and state history. Waves of angry passion were now sweeping over the length and breadth of the land, and the cloud of war, at first no bigger than a man's hand, was soon to burst in relentless fury over the devoted country. Perhaps no better resume can be found of the causes which led the people of Virginia to sever their ties from the Union they had loved so well, than the following, viz. : PREAMBLE AND RESOLUTION Offered in a large mass meeting of the people of Botetourt County, Decem- ber 10th, 1860, by the Honorable John J. Allen, President of the Su preme Court of Virginia, and adopted with but two disseuting voices. The people of Botetourt County, in general nreetiug assembled, believe it to be the duty of all the citizens of the Commonwealth, in the present alarming condition of our country, to give some expression of their opinion upon the threatening aspect of pvrblic affairs. They deem it unnecessary and out of place to avow sentiments of loyalty to the Constitution and devotion to the union of these States. A brief reference to the part the State has acted in the past will furnish the best evidence of the feelings of her sons in regard to the union of the States and the Constitution, which is the sole bond which binds them together. In the controversies with the mother country, growing out of the efforts of the latter to tax the colonies without their consent, it was Vir ginia who, by the Resolutions against the Stamp Act, gave the example of the first authoritative resistance by a legislative body to the British Gov ernment, and so imparted the first impulse to the Revolution. Virginia declared her independence before any of the colonies, and gave the first written Constitution to mankind. By her instructions her representatives in the General Congress intro duced a Resolution to declare the colonies independent States, and the Declaration itself was written by one of her sons. She furnished to the Confederate States the father of his country,"], [409, "JOHN LETCHER. 371 under whose guidance independence was achieved, and the rights and liberties of each State, it was hoped, perpetually established. She stood undismayed through the long night of the Revolution, breasting the storm of war and pouring out the blood of her sons like water on almost every battle-field, from the ramparts of Quebec to the sauds of Georgia. By her own unaided efforts the northwestern territory was conquered, whereby the Mississippi, instead of the Ohio River, was recognized as the boundary of the United States by the treaty of peace. To secure harmony, and as an evidence of her estimate of the value of the union of the States, she ceded to all, for their common benefit, this magnificent region \u2014 an empire in itself. When the Articles of Confederation were shown to be inadequate to secure peace and tranquility at home and respect abroad, Virginia first moved to bring about a more perfect union. At her instance the first assemblage of comnrissiouers took place at Annapolis, which ultimately led to the meeting of the Convetrtiorr which formed the present Constitu tion. This instrument itself was in a great measure the production of one of her sous, who has been justly styled \"The father of the Constitu tion.\" The government created by it was put into operation with her Washington, the father of his country, at its head; her Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, in his cabinet ; her Madison, the great advocate of the Constitution, in the legislative hall. Under the leading of Virginia statesmen the Revolution of 1798 was broirght about, Louisiana was acquired, and the second war of indepen dence was waged. Throughout the whole progress of the Republic she has never infringed on the rights of any state, nor asked or received an exclusive benefit. On the contrary, she has been the first to vindicate the equality of all the States \u2014 the smallest as well as the greatest. But, claiming no exclusive benefit for her efforts and sacrifices in the common cause, she had a right to look for feelings of fraternity and kind ness for her citizens from the citizens of other States, and equality of rights for her citizens with all others ; that those for whom she had done so much would abstain from actual aggressions upon her soil, or if they could not be prevented, would show themselves ready and prompt in punishing the aggressors ; and that the common government, to the promotion of which she contributed so largely for the purpose of \" establishing justice and insuring domestic tranquility,\" would not, whilst the forms of the Constitution were observed, be so perverted in spirit as to inflict wrong and injustice, and produce universal insecurity. These reasonable expectations have been grievously disappointed. Owing to a spirit of pharasaical fanaticism prevailing in the North, in reference to the institution of slavery, incited by foreign emissaries and fostered by corrupt political demagogues, in search of power and place, a"], [410, "372 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. feeling has been aroused between the people of the two sections of what was once a common country, which of itself would almost preclude the administration of a united government in harmony. For the kindly feelings of a kindred people we find substituted distrust, suspicion, and mutual aversion. For a common pride in the name of American, we find one section even in foreign lands pursuing the other with revilings and reproach. For the religion of a Divine Redeemer of all, we find a religion of hate against a part ; and in all the private relations of life, instead of fraternal regard, a \" consuming hate,\" which has bvrt seldonr characterized warring nations. This feeling has prompted a hostile incursion upon our own soil, and an apotheosis of the murderers, who were justly condemned and executed. It has shown itself in the legislative halls by the passage of laws to obstruct a law of Congress passed in pursuance of a plain provision of the Constitution. It has been manifested by the industrious circulation of incendiary publicatious, sanctioned by leading nren, occupying the highest stations in the gift of the people, to produce discord and division in our midst, and incite to midnight murder and every imaginable atrocity against an unof fending community. It has displayed itself in a persistent denial of the equal rights of the citizens of each State to settle with their property in the common territory acquired by the blood and treasure of all. It is shown in their openly avowed determination to circumscribe the institution of slaver}- within the territory of the States now recognizing it, the inevitable effect of which would be to fill the present slave-holding States with an ever increasing negro population, resulting in the banish ment of our own non-slave-holding population in the first instance, aud the eventual surrender of our country to a barbarous race, or, what seems to be desired, an amalganration with the African. And it has at last culminated in the election, by a sectional rrrajority of the free States alone, to the first office in the Republic, of the author of the sentiment that there is an \"irrepressible conflict\" between free and slave labor, and that there must be universal freedom or universal slavery ; a sentiment which inculcates, as a necessity of our situation, warfare between the two sections of our country without cessation or intermission until the weaker is reduced to subjection. In view of this state of things, we are not inclined to rebuke or censure the people of any of our sister States in the South, suffering from injury, goaded by insults, and threatened with such outrages and wrongs, for their bold determination to relieve themselves from such injustice and oppres sion, by resorting to their ultimate and sovereign right to dissolve the compact which they had formed, and to provide new guards for their future security."], [411, "fOHN LETCHER. 373 Nor have we any doubt of the right os any State, there being no com mon umpire between co-equal sovereign States, to judge for itself, on its own responsibility, as to the mode and measure of redress. The States, each for itself, exercised this sovereign power when they dissolved their connection with the British Empire. They exercised the same power when nine of the States seceded from the Confederation and adopted the present Constitution, though two States at first rejected it. The Articles of Confederation stipulated that those Articles should be inviolably observed by every State, and that the Union should be perpetual, and that no alteration should be made unless agreed to by Congress and confirmed by every State. Notwithstanding this solemn compact, a portion of the States did, without the consent of the others, form a new compact ; and there is nothing to show, or by which it can be shown, that this right has been, or can be, diminished so long as the States continue sovereign. The Confederation was assented to by the Legislature for each State ; the Constitution, by the people of each State for such State alone. One is as binding as the other, and no more so. The Constitution, it is true, established a government, and it operates directly on the individual ; the Confederation was a league operating pri marily on the States. But each was adopted by the State for itself; in the one case by the Legislature acting for the State ; in the other, \"by the people, not as individuals composing one nation, but as composing the distinct and independent States to which they respectively belong.\" The foundation, therefore, on which it was established was federal, and the State, in the exercise of the same sovereign authority by which she ratified for herself, may, for herself, abrogate and annul. The operation of its powers, whilst the State remains in the Confed eracy, is national; and consequently, a State remaining in the Confederacy and enjoying its benefits cannot, by any mode of procedure, withdraw- its citizens from the obligation to obey the Constitution and the laws passed in pursuance thereof. But, when a State does secede, the Constitutiorr and laws of the United vStates cease to operate therein. No power is conferred on Congress to enforce them. Such authority was denied to the Congress in the Conven tion which framed the Constitution, because it would be an act of war of nation against nation\u2014 not the exercise of the legitimate power of a gov ernment to enforce its laws on those subject to its jurisdiction. The assumption of such a power would be the assertion of a prerogative claimed by the British Government to legislate for the colonies in all cases whatever ; it would constitute of itself a dangerous attack on the rights of the States, and should be promptly repelled. These principles, resulting from the nature of our system of Confed erate States, cannot admit of question in Virginia."], [412, "374 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. Our people in convention, by their act of ratification, declared and made known that the powers granted under the Constitution being derived from the people of the United States, may be resumed by them whenever they shall be perverted to their injury and oppression. From what people were these powers derived ? Confessedly from the people of each State, acting for themselves. By whom were they to be resumed or taken back ? By the people of the State who were then grant ing them away. Who were to determine whether the powers granted had been perverted to their injury or oppression ? Not the whole people of the United States, for there could be no oppression of the whole with their own consent ; and it could not have entered into the conception of the convention that the powers granted could not be resumed uutil the oppres sor himself united in such resumption. They asserted the right to resume in order to guard the people of Vir ginia, for whom alone the convention could act, against the oppression of au irresponsible and sectional majority, the worst form of oppression with which an angry Providence has ever afflicted humanity. Whilst, therefore, we regret that any State should, in a matter of com mon grievance, have determined to act for herself without consulting with her sister States equally aggrieved, we are nevertheless constrained to say that the occasion justifies and loudly calls for action of some kind. The election of a President, by a sectional majority, as the representa tive of the principles referred to, clothed with the patronage and power incident to the office, including the authority to appoint all the postmas ters and other officers charged with the execution of the laws of the United States, is itself a standing menace to the South \u2014 a direct assault upon her institutions \u2014 an incentive to robbery and insurrection, requiring from our own immediate local government, in its sovereign character, prompt action to obtain additional guarantees for equality and security iu the Union, or to take measures for protection and security without it. In view, therefore, of the present condition of our country, and the causes of it, we declare almost in the words of our fathers, contained in an address of the freeholders of Botetourt, iu February, 1775, to the delegates from Virginia to the Continental Congress, \"That we desire no change in our government whilst left to the free enjoyment of our equal privileges secured by the Constitution ; but, that should a wicked and tyrannical sec tional majority, under the sanction of the forms of the Constitution, per sist in acts of injustice and violence towards us, they only must be answer able for the consequences. \"That liberty is so strongly impressed upon our hearts that we caunot think of parting with it but with our lives ; that our duty to God, our country, ourselves and our posterity forbids it; we stand, therefore, pre pared for ever}- contingency.\" Resolved, therefore, That in view of the facts set out in the foregoing preamble, it is the opinion of this meeting that a convention of the peo-"], [413, "JOHN LETCHER. 375 pie should be called forthwith ; that the State, in its sovereign character, should consult with the other Southern States, and agree upon such guar antees as in their opinion will secure their equality, tranquility and rights within the Union, and in the event of a failure to obtain such guarantees, to adopt in concert with the other Southern States, or alone, such meas ures as may seem most expedient to protect the rights and insure the safety of the people of Virginia. And in the event of a change in our relations to the other States being rendered necessary, that the convention so elected should recommend to the people, for their adoption, such alterations in our State constitution as may adapt it to the altered condition of the State and country. The following Ordinances of two Conventions, held upon the soil of Virginia, the one at Richmond, April and May, 1 86 1, and the other at Wheeling, June, 1861, will give also some idea of the disorder which was about to shake the pillars of the old Commonwealth to their foundations : AN ORDINANCE To repeal the ratification of the Constitution of the United States of America, by the State of Virginia, and to resume all the rights and powers granted under said Constitution. Adopted by the Convention of Virginia on April 17th, 1861. Richmond, Virginia. The people of Virginia, in their ratification of the Constitution of the United States of America, adopted by thenr in convention on the twenty fifth day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, having declared that the powers granted under the said Con stitution were derived fronr the people of the United States, and might be resumed whensoever the same should be perverted to their injury and oppression ; and the Federal Government having perverted said powers, not only to the injury of the people of Virginia, but to the oppression of the Southern slaveholding States : Now, therefore, we the people of Virginia do declare and ordain, that the ordinance adopted by the people of this State in convention on the twenty-fifth day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hun dred and eighty-eight, whereby the Constitution of the United States of America was ratified, and all acts of the General Assembly of this State rat ifying or adopting amendments to said Constitution, are hereby repealed and abrogated ; that the union between the State of Virginia and the other States under the Constitution aforesaid is hereby dissolved, and that the State of Virginia is in the full possession and exercise of all the rights of sovereignty which belong and appertain to a free and independent State. And they do further declare, that said Constitution of the United States of America is no longer binding on any of the citizens of this State."], [414, "376 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. This ordinance shall take effect and be an act of this day, when rati fied by a majority of the votes of the people of this State, cast at a poll to be taken thereon on the fourth Thursday in May next, in pursuance of a schedule hereafter to be enacted. Done in convention, in the city of Richmond, on the seventeenth day of April in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hvrndred and sixty one, and in the eighty-fifth year of the Commonwealth of Virginia. A DECLARATION Of the people of Virginia represented in Convention at the City of Wheel- ing, Thursday, June 13th, 1861. The true purpose of all government is to promote the welfare and pro vide for the protection and security of the governed, and when any form or organization of government proves inadequate for, or subversive of this purpose, it is the right, it is the duty of the latter to alter or abolish it. The Bill of Rights of Virginia, framed in 1776, reaffirmed in 1830, and again in 185 1, expressly reserves this right to a majority of her people. The act of the General Assembly, calling the Convention which assenrbled at Richmond in February last, without the previously expressed consent of such majority, was therefore a usurpation ; and the Convention thus called has not only abused the powers nominally entrusted to it, but, with the connivance and active aid of the executive, has usurped and exercised other powers, to the manifest injury of the people, which, if permitted, will inevitably subject them to a military despotism. The Convention, by its pretended ordinances, has required the people of Virginia to separate from and wage war against the government of the United States, and against the citizens of neighboring States, with whom they have heretofore maintained friendly social and business relations: It has attempted to subvert the union founded by Washington and his co-patriots in the purer days of the Republic, which has conferred unex ampled prosperity upon every class of citizens, and upon every section of the country : It has attempted to transfer the allegiance of the people to an illegal confederacy of rebellious States, and required their submission to its pre tended edicts and decrees : It has attempted to place the whole military force and military opera tions of the Commonwealth under the control and direction of such Con federacy, for offensive as well as defensive purposes : It has, in conjunction with the State Executive, instituted wherever their usurped power extends, a reign of terror, intended to suppress the free expression of the will of the people, making elections a mockery and a fraud : The same combination, even before the passage of the pretended Ordinance of Secession, instituted war by the seizure and appropriation of the property of the Federal Government, and by organizing and mobilizing"], [415, "JOHN LETCHER. 377 armies, with the avowed purpose of capturing or destroying the Capital of the Union : They have attempted to bring the allegiance of the people of the United States into direct conflict with their subordinate allegiance to the State, thereby making obedience to their pretended Ordinances, treason against the former. We, therefore, the delegates here assembled in Convention to devise such measures and take such action as the safety and welfare of the loyal citizens of Virginia may demand, having maturely considered the prem ises, and viewing with great concern the deplorable condition to which this once happy Commonwealth must be reduced unless some regular, adequate remedy is speedily adopted, and appealing to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe for the rectitude of our intentions, do hereby, in the name and on the behalf of the good people of Virginia, solemnly declare, that the preservation of their dearest rights and liberties, and their security in per son and property, imperatively demand the re-organization of the govern ment of the Commonwealth, and that all acts of said Convention and Executive, tending to separate this Commonwealth from the United States, or to levy and carry on war against them, are without authority and void ; and that the offices of all who adhere to the said Convention and Executive, whether legislative, executive, or judicial, are vacated. Governor Letcher loved the Union deeply, and his voice was raised for moderation, conciliation, and for peace; but, when Virginia severed her bonds from the government she had so largely helped to establish, then her loyal Governor stood by her side. Bravely did he fulfill his duty. Every energy was devoted to the cause ; and for nearly three years he controlled the war policy of the State, and was a strong support to the Southern Confederacy. During the war his home was burned, but when hostilities had ceased, and the white dove of peace had settled on the land, Governor Letcher, emancipated from prison, where he had for several months been confined by the Federal authorities, returned to Lexing- ton, and sought to build anew his shattered fortunes. In 1875 he was elected to the House of Delegates, and in 1876, whilst in attendance upon the Assembly, was suddenly stricken with paralysis. He passed peacefully away at Lex ington, January 26th, 1884, closing a valuable life, crowned with the love and esteem of his fellow-citizens. A joint resolution of respect to his memory was passed by the xxv"], [416, "378 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. General Assembly, then in session, from which the following is an extract, viz.: \"Through a life-time covering the most eventful period in the history of Virginia, the great powers of his mind and the warm affections of his heart were devoted with constant faithfulness and energy to the service of his State and Country. As a representative of Virginia in the Congress of the United States, as her Governor in the most trying epoch of her history, he won the love and admiration of her people, and a place in that history, where his name will live as long as unswerving honesty in the administra tion of public trust and great ability, wisdom and patriotism in the discharge of official duty, shall be honored among men.\" He left a widow and seven children to mourn his loss. A portrait of Governor Letcher adorns the State Library at Richmond, Virginia."], [417, "379 CVIII. WILLIAM SMITH. Governor. January i, 1864, to May 9, 1865. We now return to our review of William Smith's life, and find him, on January 1, 1864, entering for the second time upon the administration of civil affairs as Chief Executive of Virginia. His experience of active life as a soldier up to this time had made him familiar with many needs of the military service of his country, and these his fertile genius now rose to meet. Finding that local defense was indispens- able at Richmond, the place being often menaced by the enemy, Governor Smith promptly organized two regiments of men exempt from duty by reason of disability, age or non- age, etc., attaching to each regiment a company of cavalry. When the city was threatened afterwards, he assumed the command of these troops, and on several occasions they ren- dered highly important service. Again Governor Smith realized fully, from personal observation, the great necessity of supplies for the Southern Army, and by his independent and sagacious plans in this behalf, he materially assisted the Confederate commissariat. His measures were eminently successful, and at the close of the war, the Confederacy was indebted to Virginia in the sum of $300,000, for supplies obtained through the agency of Governor Smith. Upon the evacuation of Richmond, April 3, 1865, Governor Smith determined to remove the seat of government to Lynch burg, Virginia. Three days after his arrival there *General Lee surrendered to General Grant. Again attempting to follow the fortunes of the Confederacy, he moved yet farther south, to Danville, Virginia. Here his hopes were shattered, * See Note C."], [418, "380 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. and he returned to his home, surrendered himself to the Fed eral authorities and received his parole. After the war he resided in Warrenton, Virginia, and there, for a time, enjoyed the serene pleasures of a green old age. He passed from the arena of human life in this quiet home, having sur vived his wife, who had been his companion since 1811 ; but he left several children to perpetuate the memory of the worthy deeds of their distinguished father. With the close of Governor Smith's second term, drew near, also, the end of the war between the States ; a war that did not cease until the battles had numbered 2,261, nor until, for four long years, the South had been drenched in blood. But, with the end came peace, and only such peace as could be bought at such a price ; the peace of calm after storm, of consent after conflict ; the peace of forgetfulness and forgive ness ; the peace which the fathers bought and which the sons had only for a season chased from the Ark of their Cove nant \u2014 the hallowed American Union."], [419, "381 CIX. FRANCIS H. PIERPOINT. Governor. May 9, 1865, to April 16, 1868. Francis H. Pierpoint, descended from early settlers of New York and Central Pennsylvania, who had migrated to Virginia, was born January 25th, 1814, in Monongalia County, Virginia. His father was a farmer and also con ducted a tannery, in both of which occupations he was assisted by his son, Francis. Young Pierpoint's educational advantages were at this time very limited, but in June, 1835, he entered Alleghany College, at Meadville, Pennsylvania, from whence he graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Arts, in September, 1839. He now taught school until 1841, when he removed to Mississippi, still continuing a teacher. Iu 1842 he returned to Virginia, and having studiously applied himself, during his hours of leisure, to the acquisi tion of the principles of law, he was now admitted a practi tioner in his chosen profession. From 1848, for a period of eight years, he served as the local counsel of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, for the Counties of Marion and Taylor. In 1853 he engaged in mining and shipping coal by rail, and a little later, in the manufacture of fire bricks. He early took an active interest in politics, and became prominent in his section as an uncompromising opponent of slavery. When the Ordinance of Secession was passed, April 17, 1 86 1, by the State Convention at Richmond, it was ratified by the people of Eastern Virginia, whilst the vote in Western Virginia was largely against it. In this anomalous attitude of affairs, Mr. Pierpoint conceived the idea of a \"restored government,\" and at his suggestion a Convention en masse"], [420, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 382 was held at Wheeling. This led, finally, to the separation of West Virginia from the parent State, and the organization of an independent State government, upon which was en grafted the intention of the people to maintain the rights of the Commonwealth in the Union. Francis H. Pierpoint was chosen ' ' Provisional Governor ' ' of this ' ' restored gov ernment,\" by Convention, and he immediately organized twelve Regiments of Militia to serve in the United States Army. Subsequently a State Constitution was framed, which was ratified by the people of West Virginia, on May 3, 1862, and Governor Pierpoint was elected Governor, to fill the remaining portion of the term of Governor Letcher, as West Virginia had declared that the functions of all offi cers in the State of Virginia who adhered to the Southern Confederacy were suspended, and the offices vacated. West Virginia was admitted as a State into the Union on June 20, 1863, and Governor Pierpoint, who had been elected in the month of May for the term of three years commencing January 1, 1864, now removed the seat of government to Alexandria, Virginia. At his request a Convention was called to pass an Ordinance of general slave emancipation, and this, on February 22, 1864 was consummated in an Ordinance abolishing slavery in the State forever. On the 25th of May, 1865, Governor Pierpoint removed his seat of Government to Richmond, the capital of Virginia. Here he addressed himself to the tremendous difficulties of the situation, but he clearly had the good of the people at heart, and, by every effort and influence, he struggled, and not in vain, to mitigate the trials of those by whom he was surrounded. He continued in office beyond the period of his term, which expired January 1, 1868, and held until April 16, 1868, when he was succeeded by General H. H. Wells, appointed Provisional Governor by General John M. Scho field, commanding the Military Department of Virginia. Governor Pierpoint now retired to private life. As an interesting picture of political affairs in Virginia at this time, the following Resolutions of the General Assembly are here quoted :"], [421, "FRANCIS H. PIERPOINT. 383 JOINT RESOLUTIONS Requesting the President of the United States to grant a general Amnesty to the Citizens of Virginia. Adopted December 15, 1865. Whereas, the people of Virginia are invited by the President of the United States to unite, at this time, in giving thanks to Almighty God for the return of peace and the restoration of the ancient relations between the government of the United States and themselves\u2014 relations which it is desirable should be universal, and without exception of individuals; and whereas, observation and experience have impressed the members of this General Assembly with the conviction that the more liberal exercise of executive clemency is the surest and speediest means of overcoming estrangements and reawakening those sentiments of attachment and devo tion in which a government, based on the consent of the governed, will always find its best support and strongest defence: and whereas, in the stricken and prostrate condition of this Commonwealth, it is of vital importance that all of her citizens (who, from experience in public affairs and from the influence they command, are capable of aiding in her resus citation) should be relieved from such disabilities as impair their capacity for usefulness : Therefore, Be it resolved by the General Assembly, That the President be earn estly requested to grant a general pardon to all citizens of Virginia requir ing executive clemency under existing laws of the United States. JOINT RESOLUTIONS Approving the Policy of the President of the United States, in reference to the Reconstruction of the Union. Adopted February 6, 1866. 1.

Here, he was a successful practitioner from 1846 to 1861, serving in the Michigan Leg islature from 1854 to 1856. Upon the breaking out of the late civil war, Mr. Wells entered the volunteer service of the United States Army, and rose to the distinction of Brigadier-General. Having re signed from the army, he located in 1865 in Richmond, Virginia, and resumed the practice of law. Here he was ap pointed, April 16, 1868, by General John M.

General Wells was soon after appointed United States Attor ney for the Eastern District of Virginia, which position he held until 1872, when he resigned and resumed the practice of law. In 1875 he removed to Washington City, and in September of that year was appointed and entered upon the duties of United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. He held this post until 1879.

In 1 88 1 Governor Walker removed to his native place, Binghamton, New York, but later, settled in New York City, enjoying there a lucrative practice.

James Lawson Kemper was descended from one of the families which arrived in Virginia from Oldenburg, Germany, in April, 17 14. These Germans left their native land for the free exercise of their religion, \"The Reformed Calvinistic Church,\" and finally settled at a place they called \" Ger mantown,\" about eight miles from what is now, Warrenton, in Fauquier County, Virginia. Mr. Kemper was born in Madison County, Virginia, in 1824. After early tuition in primary schools in his native county he entered Washington College, from whence he graduated with the degree of Master of Arts. Subsequently he studied law. In 1847 he was commissioned Captain in the volunteer service of the United States, by President James K. Polk, and joined General Zachary Taylor's army of occupation in Mexico, just after the battle of Buena Vista, and thus failed in the desired honor of active service in the Mexican War. Returning to his home in Virginia, Captain Kemper at once entered political life, and was sent by his native county to represent it in the House of Delegates, where he remained for ten years, serving two years as Speaker, and for a long period was the Chairman of the Committee on Military af fairs. On the 2d of May, 1861, he was commissioned by the Virginia Convention, on the nomination of Governor Letcher, Colonel of Virginia Volunteers, C. S. A., and assigned to the command of the 7th Regiment of Infantry, which command he assumed at Manassas, Virginia. From this time on, he participated in the most sanguinary operations of the war."], [430, "392 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. Immediately after the battle of Williamsburg, May 5, 1862, where, with his 7th Regiment, he had been in the hottest of the fight for nine successive hours, Colonel Kemper was pro moted to the rank of Brigadier-General. Engaging now constantly in active sendee in the field, he passed through many bloody battles, until at Gettysburg he received a des perate wound. This, for a period, rendered him unfit for field duty, but, when partially recovered, he was assigned to the important command of the local forces in and around Richmond, the oft-beleaguered Capital of the Confederacy. On March 1, 1864, General Kemper was commissioned Major-General. Until the evacuation of Richmond, General Kemper remained in command of the forces protecting that city. Upon the close of the war he returned to his home in Madison County, and resumed the practice of law. In 1873 he was elected Governor of Virginia, and assumed the duties of this office January 1, 1874. His administration was highly successful, and the old State turned once more to her Chief Executive as to one whom the people delighted to honor. Upon the expiration of his term Governor Kemper retired to his home in Madison County, carrying the honor and affection of his grateful fellow-citizens with him. The following Resolutions passed by the General Assem bly during the early part of Governor Kemper' s administra tion, will show the sentiments then prevalent in the state concerning the celebrated Civil Rights Bill : JOINT RESOLUTIONS Reaffirming the Third Resolution of the Conservative Platform of 1873, and Protesting against the passage of the Civil Rights Bill, now pend- ing in the Congress of the United States.

Frederick William Mackey Holliday, of staunch Scotch-Irish lineage, is descended directly from William Hol liday, who came from the north of Ireland to America with his parents, at the age of fourteen. They settled first in Pennsylvania, but afterwards located permanently in Win chester, Virginia. Here the family attained prominence and influence in the social and business world of that region. Mr. Holliday, the subject of this sketch, son of Dr. Richard J. M. Holliday, was born in Winchester, Virginia, February 22, 1828. After enjoying preparatory instruction at the Academy of his native place, he entered Yale College, from which institution he graduated with distinguished honors in 1847. Adopting the legal profession, he entered the Univer sity of Virginia, and in one session graduated in law and other high branches of education. His gifts as a speaker were recognized in his selection as ' ' Final Orator ' ' of the Jefferson Society, and he returned from college life well pre pared to enter the arena of legal, literary, and political debate. Within a year after coming to the bar he was elected Com monwealth's Attorney for the Courts of Winchester and County of Frederick, and continued to hold this position by successive re-election until the breaking out of the late civil war. He went with the first troops to Harper's Ferry, and on his return from that historic prelude to the great drama about to be enacted, he assumed command of a Company of Infantry raised in his native place. Captain Holliday devoted himself now to the thorough discipline and drill of his company, which, for a time, was employed in detached 39-1"], [433, "FREDERICK W. M. HOI.L/DAY. 395 service, but was subsequently assigned to the 33d Virginia Infantry, \"Stonewall Brigade.\" Captain Holliday, by suc cessive promotion, attained the command of the Regiment. He participated in all the encounters in which his command was engaged, including the sanguinary battles of McDowell's, Winchester, Port Republic, and those around Richmond, without being absent from duty for a single day, until August 9, 1862, when at the battle of Cedar Run, or Slaughter's Mountain, he lost his right arm. This injury unfitting him for service in the field, he was elected to the Confederate Congress, of which body he remained a member until the close of the war. Colonel Holliday now returned to Winchester, and resum ing his former profession took a high rank at the bar. Enjoying from this time on, many positions of confidence and honor, he was finally elected Governor of Virginia, and entered upon the duties of the office January 1 , 1878. His public acts during his term are chiefly expressed in his various state papers, and his faithful administration of the affairs of Virginia in a season of peculiar trial, reflects great credit upon his purity as an Executive, and upon his unfaltering devotion to the honor and glory of his state. To a sound and broad educa tion he added personal ability of a high order, and the most unflinching intellectual and moral courage. He had an exalted standard of public life, and his services in the cause of the State debt, rendered at every risk of political advance ment, specially distinguished his course as Governor of Vir ginia. Governor Holliday has been twice married, but no chil dren survive by either marriage. Since the expiration of his gubernatorial term his time has been chiefly devoted to for eign travel, embellishing thereby a mind already stored with unusual literary attainments.

According to tradition, the family is descended from the Scottish chieftain of the clan Cameron, Sir Ewan Lochiel, whose prowess is cele brated in song as well as history. Young Cameron was early thrown upon his own re sources by the death of his parents, and at the age of six teen he went West in pursuit of fortune. Upon the breaking out of the late civil war, he left St. Louis, Missouri, and returned to his native state. He enlisted as a private in Company A, 12th Regiment, Virginia Volunteers. His soldierly merit was soon acknowledged, and by successive promotions he attained the rank of Brigade Inspector. He served throughout the war, was several times severely wounded, and finally surrendered at Appomattox Court House, with the rank of Captain. From this time, he devoted his talents principally to jour nalism, being connected with the editorial staff of the \"Daily News,\" of Petersburg, Virginia, and afterwards with \"The Index and Appeal,\" of the same city. He then edited the \"Norfolk Virginian,\" but returned to Petersburg and took charge of the \"Index,\" which he conducted until 1870, when he became editor of the \" Richmond Whig.\" In 1872 Captain Cameron assumed control of the ' ' Richmond Enquirer, ' ' which he conducted until 1873.

FITZHUGH LEE. Governor. January i, 1886, to January 1, 1890. Fitzhugh LEE is the third of this distinguished family whose name is enrolled upon the list of Virginia's chief executives, viz. : Thomas Lee, President of the Council, J749; Henry Lee, Governor, 1791, and the subject of this sketch, who assumed the duties of this high office, January 1, 1886. Fitzhugh Lee was born at \"Clermont,\" Fairfax County, Virginia, November 19, 1835, being the son of Sydney Smith Lee and Nannie Mason Lee; having Governor Henry Lee as grandfather on the paternal, and George Mason as great grandfather on the maternal side. At the age of sixteen, Fitzhugh Lee was appointed a cadet at West Point, from which institution he graduated with distinction, and was commissioned Second Lieutenant in the famous old Second Cavalry, of which Albert Sidney Johnston was Colonel. Lieutenant Lee soon distinguished himself as a disciplinarian, and later, won the admiration of his com- rades on the frontier of Texas, by his gallantry in various fights with the Indians. He was the Second Lieutenant of Kirby Smith's Company, and when that company joined the celebrated and successful Wichita expedition under Van Dorn, Lee was selected by Van Dorn as his Adjutant. In the battle of May 13, 1859, between six companies of his regiment and a large force of Comanche Indians, he was chosen to command a picked body that charged on foot the thick jungle, in which the Indians had taken refuge. Lieu tenant Lee fell, towards the end of the fight, pierced through the lungs with an arrow ; he was carried out on the prairie,"], [438, "400 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. and borne for 200 miles in a horse litter, and his life for weeks was despaired of. General Scott, subsequently, in published orders, says: ' ' Major Van Dorn notices the conspicuous gallantry and energy of Second Lieutenant Fitzhugh Lee, Adjutant of the expedition, who was dangerously wounded.\" On the 15th January, 1860, he is again mentioned in orders by General Scott as having (in command of a portion of his company) had another fight with the Indians, in which his rapid pur suit, recovery of stolen property, and personal combat with one of the chiefs, are all highly commended. The spirit of \"Light-Horse Harry\" certainly showed itself now in his young grandson. In May, 1860, Fitzhugh Lee was appointed instructor of Cavalry at West Point, a very complimentary detail, and it was while fulfilling the duties of this post that the breaking out of the late civil war found him. He now resigned his position in the United States Army, with pangs known only to the truly loyal in a case of divided duty, and was first assigned in the Confederate States Army, as Adjutant-General to Gen eral R. S. Ewell. He served here in the first battle of Manassas, and after that was made Lieutenant-Colonel of the First Virginia Cavalry. From this time on, \" Fitz Lee\" was so identified with the Cavalry of the Army of Northern Virginia that it would take a history of this branch of the service to narrate his operations. Suffice it to say, that he gathered honors as the combat grew, and in May, 1863, shortly after the battle of Chancellorsville, Virginia, we find his uncle, the Commanding General, Robert E. Lee, thus writing to him : \" Your admirable couduct, devotion to the cause of your country, and devotion to duty, fill me with pleasure. I hope you will soon see her efforts for independence crowned with success, and long live to enjoy the affection and gratitude of your country.\" In the latter part of 1863, Fitzhugh Lee was placed in command of a division of Cavalry, and in the spring of 1865 he was by order of the Commanding General placed in com-"], [439, "FITZHUGH LEE. 401 mand of the Cavalry Corps of the army of Northern Virginia. He was one of the three Corps Commanders who, with General R. E. Lee, composed the Council of War just before the sur render. After that event, General Fitzhugh Lee retired to his farm in Stafford County, Virginia, and accepting the situation of defeat, amidst the desolation around, turned his attention to the milder arts of peace. His hold upon the affections of the people of Virginia was thus deepened, for passing together through this period of trial \u2014 sharper than the iron hail of battle \u2014 they became doubly united to him through common suffering and disaster. They lost no opportunity to do him honor, and his noble desire to ' ' bury the past ' ' strongly appealed to the better judgment of those who, with that past, had much to bury. At the Yorktown Centennial, General Fitzhugh Lee com manded the Virginia troops, and received an ovation equal to that accorded to the President of the United States, or any of the distinguished soldiers and civilians pres ent. At the inaugural of President Cleveland, on the 4th March, 1885, as General Lee rode up Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D. C, at the head of the Division he com manded, he was greeted everywhere with cheers and the wav ing of handkerchiefs, and unconsciously evoked an enthu siasm which must have warmed his soldier heart. Again, when he served on General Hancock's staff at the funeral of General Grant, he met the same fervid and flattering greeting.* No wonder was it then that this favorite of the people was, in 1885, elected Governor of Virginia. He assumed the duties of the office, January 1, 1886, and his administration * Major Courtland H.

C. and at the inauguration of President Cleveland, March 4, 1885 ; he was also Aide upon Gen eral Hancock's staff at General Grant's funeral\u2014 all important and imposing occasions. Major Smith was Mayor of Alexandria, Virginia, in 1879, and in 1880 funded one milliou dollars of the City's debt. His picture is engraved upon the bonds of the new issue.

PHILIP W. McKINNEY. Governor. January i, 1890, to January 1, 1894. Philip W. McKinney, son of Charles and Martha Guar rant McKinney, was born in Buckingham County, Virginia, March 17, 1832. His early school days were passed in his native county, but his higher education was pursued first at Hampden Sidney College, whence he graduated with dis tinction ; and later, at Washington and Lee University, where he made the study of law a specialty. After leaving the University, he entered immediately upon the practice of his profession. In April, 1861, he entered the Confederate States Army as Captain of Company K, 4th Virginia Cavalry, and was with that regiment in all of its gallant sendee, until incapaci tated for the field by wounds received in 1863, at Brandy Station, Virginia. After this he performed local duty for a year at Danville, and then took his seat as a member of the General Assembly of Virginia, where he served until the close of the war. Since that time he has been one of the most prom inent members of the bar in Virginia. He has filled the office of prosecuting attorney for several terms, has been three times elector on the Democratic Presidential ticket for the fourth district in Virginia; was elector at large in 1884; in 1881 was the Democratic nominee for Attorney- General, and in 1885 was a candidate for nomination for Governor of Vir ginia, receiving among the several candidates the next high est vote to that by which Governor Lee was nominated. In 1889, Mr. McKinney was elected Governor of Virginia for the term of four years, beginning January 1, 1890. Governor McKinney has been twice married, and has two"], [442, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 404 children. His first wife, Miss Nannie Christian, died leav ing one son, Robert C, when Mr. McKinney married, sec ondly, Miss Annie Lyle, of Farmville, Virginia. Governor McKinney's period of administration has been of special interest in the history of the Commonwealth, em bracing as it does the settlement of the question of the state debt \u2014 a question which for several years had agitated the public mind in Virginia to a very serious extent. In developing the internal resources of the state, Virginia, as far back as 1820, resorted to the policy of building her canals, railroads, and turnpikes with money borrowed upon her own credit. For this, she in return issued her bonds, promising to pay six per cent, per annum until the principal was returned. Virginia kept her promise faithfully until the outbreak of the late civil war, when she, whose word was her bond and whose bond was as good as gold, became hemmed in by a circle of fire from the outer world, and was the prey of the devastation and rapine of war within her borders. Her creditors at the North and in Europe beheld her torn and bleeding, but they awaited the hour when, true to herself, she would redeem her pledges. To complicate the issue, the territory of Virginia had during the war been dismembered, and fully one third of her fair domain erected into a separate state, known as West Virginia. This portion of the state had participated in bor rowing the money and in sharing the benefits with which Virginia was charged, and it seemed but reasonable that (though subsequently in altered relations to the Union) West Virginia's actual and honorable indebtedness should be unchanged to the creditors of Virginia. At an extra session of the General Assembly, held at the City of Wheeling, July 1st, 1861, an Act was passed, July 26, 1861, authorizing the executive to borrow money on the credit of the state, and \"as security for any such loan or loans, certificates of debt or bonds of the state, irredeemable for any period not greater than thirty-four years, may be issued, and the revenue and property of the state, or any part of either, may be pledged for their redemption.\" This is"], [443, "PHILIP W. McKINNEY. 405 ample evidence of the participation of this portion of Vir ginia in borrowing money upon state credit. In 1 87 1, the principal of the debt of Virginia, with its unpaid and overdue interest, amounted to the sum of about $45,000,000. Of the legislation, litigation, and political divisions in the state growing out of the settlement of this debt, time fails to tell, but its final adjustment was accomplished during the administration of Governor McKinney, as will be seen by the following, viz.: AN ACT To provide for the settlement of the public debt of Virginia not funded under the provisions of an Act entitled ' ' An Act to ascertain and declare Virginia's equitable share of the debt created before and actu ally existing at the time of the partition of her territory and resources, and to provide for the issuance of bonds covering the same, and the regular and prompt payment of the interest thereon,\" approved Feb- ruary 14, 1882. Approved February 20, 1892. Whereas, by a joint resolution of the General Assembly of the State of Virginia, adopted on the third day of March, eighteen hundred and ninety, a commission was appointed on the part of Virginia to receive propositions for funding the debt of the State not funded under the Act known as the \" Riddleberger Bill,\" approved February fourteenth, eight een hundred and eighty-two, from # properly constituted representative of her creditors ; and Whereas, said Virginia Debt Commission has submitted a report to the General Assembly, wherein it appears that under a certain agreement, dated May twelfth, eighteen hundred aud ninety, lodged with the Central Trust Company of New York, Frederick P.

This Act shall be in force from its passage. At this point it does not seem inappropriate to give the following gleanings from a volume issued by the Commis sioner of Agriculture for Virginia, and published by author ity of law. It pictures the Virginia of today : Virginia lies in latitude 360 31' to 39\u00b0 27' north, corresponding to Southern Europe, Central Asia, Southern Japan , and California. Its long-"], [452, "414 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. itude is from 75\u00b0 13' to 83\u00b0 37' west from Greenwich. On the south it adjoins North Carolina for 326 miles and Tennessee for 114 miles, making the line of the State from the Atlantic west 440 miles. On the west and northwest, Kentucky for 115 and West Virginia (by a very irregular line) for 450 miles, form the boundary. On the northeast and north it is sepa rated by the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay fronr Maryland for 205 miles, and by a line of 25 miles across the eastern shore. East and southeast it is bordered by the Atlantic for 125 miles. The boundary lines of the State measure about 1,400 miles. On the northwest they are mostly mountain ranges; on the northeast and east, water. The longest line in the State, from the Atlantic southwest to Kentucky, is 476 miles; the longest from north to south is 192 miles. The State has an area of land surface of 40,125 square miles and a water surface estimated at 2,325 square miles. Its mountains are the two great chains of the Appalachian Range. The highest and most noted peaks are on the Blue Ridge, standing between the great valley and Pied mont, overlooking the east and west. Their location gives these high peaks a beauty and grandeur not often surpassed. Its principal inland waters are the Chesapeake and Mobjack Bays and Hampton Roads. Its only considerable lake, Lake Drummond, in the Dis mal Swamp, occupies the highest part of the swamp, being 22 feet above mean tidewater, and flows out on all sides through natural and artificial channels into the rivers. It is filled with fish, but no animals harbor or can be found near its banks. The water (called Juniper) is pleasant to the taste ; though amber-colored, keeps pure for years. Sea-going vessels have for many years secured this water for long voyages. It is used by the United States naval vessels which go out from the navy-yard at Ports mouth. The lake is nearly round and nearly 20 miles in circumference. Principal Rivers and Branches. The waters belonging to the Atlantic system drain six-sevenths of the State. The principal streams of this system are: The Potomac, a wide and deep river, the northeastern boundary of Virginia, with its large branches, the Sheuandoah and the South Branch, and its prominent smaller ones, Potomac Creek, Occoquan River, Broad Run, Goose, Catoc tin and Opequon Creeks, draining a large area of each of the sections of the State. The Potomac is navigable for no miles from where it enters the bay, some 65 miles from the ocean. It has many landings, and lines of steamers and sailing vessels connect with all portions of the country, giving great facilities for cheap transportation to a very extensive and val uable portion of the Northern Neck. The Rappahannock, with its Rapid Anne and numerous other branches, flows from the Blue Ridge across Piedmont, Middle and Tidewater, irrigating a large territory. The Rap pahannock is navigable to Fredericksburg, 92 miles from its mouth at the bay, some 40 miles from the ocean. The Piankitank, draining only a por-"], [453, "PHILIP W. McKINNEY. 415 tion of Tidewater, is navigable for some 14 miles; and Mobjack Bay and its rivers furnish deep entrances to the Gloucester Peninsula. The York, with its Pamunkey and Mattapony branches, and many tributaries, flows through a considerable area of Middle and Tidewater. The York is a wide, deep, and almost straight belt of water, reaching over 40 miles from the bay to the junction of the Pamunkey and the Mattapony, which are themselves navigable for many nriles for light-draught vessels. The James, with the Chickahominy, Elizabeth, Nansemond, Appomattox, Riv anna, Willis', Slate, Rockfish, Tye, Pedlar, North, Cowpasture, Jackson's, and many other inflowing rivers and streams of all kinds, gathers from a large territory in all the divisions, draining more of the State than any other river. The James is navigable to Richmond. The Elizabeth is a broad arm of the Hampton Roads estuary of the James, extending for 12 miles, the last four of which are expanded as the superb harbor between the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth. All these flow into Chesapeake Bay. The Chowan, through its Blackwater, Nottoway and Meherrin branches and their affluents, waters portions of Middle and Tidewater Virginia. The Roanoke, called the Staunton from the rrrouth of the Dan to the Blue Ridge, receives the Dan, Otter, Pig, and many other streams from the Valley, Piednront and Middle Virginia, and then flows through North Carolina to Albemarle Sound, joining the Chowan. The sources of the Yadkin are in the Blue Ridge. The waters of the Ohio, a part of the Mississippi system, drain the remaining seventh of the State ; but they reach the Ohio by three diverse ways. The rivers are : The Kanawha or New River, that rises in North Carolina, in the most elevated portion of the United States east of the Mississippi, flows through the plateau of the Blue Ridge, from which it receives Chestnut, Poplar Camp, Reed Island and other creeks and Little River ; across the Valley, where Cripple, Reed and Peak's Creeks join it ; across Appalachia, from which Walker's, Sinking, Big and Little Stony and Wolf Creeks and East and Bluestone Rivers flow into it, and then through West Virginia into the Ohio, having cut through the whole Appa lachian system of mountains, except its eastern barrier, the Blue Ridge. The Holston, through its South, Middle and North Forks, Moccasin Creek, etc., drains the southwestern portions of the Valley and Appa lachia; and the Clinch, by its North and South Forks, Copper Creek, Guest's and Powell's Rivers, and many other tributaries, waters the ex treme southwest of the Appalachian Country. These flow into the Ten nessee. A portion of the mountain country gives rise to the Louisa and Russell's Forks of the Big Sandy River, and to some branches of the Tug Fork of the same river, the Tug forming the Virginia line for a space. These flow into the Ohio by the Big Sandy. These are but a few of the thousand or more named and valuable streams of Virginia. They abound in all portions of the State, giving a vast quantity of water-power, irrigating the country, furnishing waters"], [454, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 416 suited to every species of fish, giving channels for the tide and inland navigation, and enlivening the landscapes. Springs are very numerous, manv of them of large size. Nearly every portion of the State is well watered. Virginia has about 1,500 nriles of steamboat navigation and as much more for small boats. Its tide-waters afford 3,000 miles of fishing shores and over 2,000 of oyster grounds. The chief cities are Richnrond, the capital, population 81,388; Norfolk, the great seaport, population 34,871 ; Petersburg, on the Appomattox, population 22,6So; Lynchburg, on the James, population 19,709; Roanoke, in the valley, 16,159; Alexandria, on the Potomac, population 14,339; Portsmouth, a seaport, population 13,268; Danville, on the Dan, population 10,305; Manchester, across the James from Richmond, population 9,246; and many smaller and well situated cities of over 5,000 inhabitants. These figures are from the census of 1S90. There are six great natural divisions of Virginia \u2014 belts of country extending across the State from northeast to southwest, nearly parallel to each other, and corresponding to the trend of the Atlantic coast on the east, and the Appalachian system of mountains on the northwest. These grand divisions are taken in the order of succession from the ocean north west across the State ; 1st. The Tidewater Country ; 2d. Middle Virginia; 3d. The Piedmont Section ; 4th. The Blue Ridge Country ; 5th. The Great Valley of Virginia ; 6th. The Appalachian Country. These divisions not only succeed each other geographically, but they occupy different levels above the sea, rising to the west like a grand stairway. They differ geo logically also ; therefore, they have differences of climate, soil, productions etc., and require separate consideration in a description of the State. Tidewater Virginia Is the eastern and southeastern part of the State that on the south borders North Carolina 104 miles; on the east has an air-line border of 120 miles along the Atlantic ; on the west is bounded by 150 nriles of the irregular outline of the Middle Country \u2014 (this would be 164 miles if it took in the mere edge of Tidewater along the Potomac up to Georgetown). The shore line of the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay for 140 miles, aud a line of 25 miles across the eastern shore, separate it from Maryland on the north. The whole forms an irregular quadrilateral, averaging 114 miles in length from north to south, and 90 in width from east to west, making an area of some 11,000 square miles. The latitude is from 360 33' to 38\u00b0 54' north, corresponding to that of the countries bordering on the northern shores of the Mediterranean. The longitude is from 750 13' to 770 30' west from Greenwich\u2014 that of Ontario, in Canada, on the north, and of the Bahamas, Cuba, etc., on the south. This is emphatically a tidewater country, since every portion of it is"], [455, "PHILIP W. McKINNEY. 417 penetrated by the tidal waters of Chesapeake Bay and its tributary rivers creeks, bays, and inlets. The united waters of nearly all this section, with those that drain 40,000 more square miles of country, or the drainage of 50,000 square miles (an area equal to that of England), flow out through the channel, 12 miles wide, between Capes Charles and Henry, and 50 or 60 miles from the land runs the ever-flowing Gulf Stream. The Middle Country Extends westward from the \"head of tide \" to the foot of the low. broken ranges that, under the names of Catocton, Bull Run, Yew, Clark's, South- west, Carter's, Green, Findlay's, Buffalo, Chandler's, Smith's, etc. mountains and hills, extend across the State southwest, from the Potomac near the northern corner of Fairfax County, to the North Carolina line, forming the eastern outliers of the Appalachian system, and that may with propriety be called the Atlantic Coast Range. The general form of this section is that of a large right-angled triangle, its base resting on the North Carolina line for 120 miles ; its perpendicular, aline 174 miles long, extending from the Carolina line to the Potomac ; just east of and parallel to the meridian of 77\u00b0 30' west, is the right line along the waving border of Tidewater, which lies east ; the hypothenuse is the 216 miles along the Coast Range before mentioned, the border of Piedmont, on the northwest \u2014 the area of the whole, including the irreg- ular outline, being some 12,470 square miles. The latitude of this section is from 360 33' to 39\u00b0 ; the longitude, 700 to 790 40' west. So its general situation and relations are nearly similar to those of Tidewater. The Middle Country is a great, moderately undulating plain, from 25 to 100 miles wide, rising to the northwest from an elevation of 150 to 200 feet above tide, at the rocky rim of its eastern margin, to from 300 to 500 along its northwestern. In general appearance this is more like a plain than any other portion of the State. The principal streams, as a rule, cross it at right angles ; so it is a succession of ridges and valleys running southeast and northwest, the valleys often narrow and deep, but the ridges generally not very prominent. The appearance of much of this country is somewhat monotonous, having many dark evergreen trees in its forests. To many portions of the Middle Country the mountain ranges to the west, of the deepest blue, form an agreeable and distant boundary to the other wise sober landscape. There are a few prominences like Willis', Slate River, and White Oak Mountains farther east, only prominent because in a champaign country. Piedmont Virginia Is the long belt of country stretching for 244 miles from the banks of the Potomac and the Maryland line southwest, along the eastern base of the xxvin"], [456, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 418 Blue Ridge Mountains, and between them and the Coast Range, to the banks of the Dan at the North Carolina line ; it varies in width from 20 to 30 miles, averaging about 25 ; its approximate area is 6,680 square miles. Its latitude corresponds with that of the State, 360 33' to 390 27' north ; its longitude is from 77\u00b0 20' to 80\u00b0 50' west. This Piedmont Country- is the fifth step of the great stairway ascend ing to the west ; its eastern edge, along Middle Virginia, is from 300 to 500 feet above the sea ; then come the broken ranges of the Coast Mount ains, rising as detached or connected knobs, in lines or groups, from 100 to 600 feet higher. These are succeeded by the numberless valleys of all imaginable forms, some long, straight, and wide ; others narrow and widening ; others again oval and alnrost enclosed, locally known as \"Coves,\" that extend across to and far into the Blue Ridge, the spurs of which often reach out southwardly for miles, ramifying in all directions. Portions of Piedmont form widely extended plains. The land west of the Coast Range is generally from 300 to 500 feet above the sea, and rises to the west, until at the foot of the Blue Ridge it attains an elevation of fronr 600 to 1,200 feet. The Blue Ridge rises to from 2,000 to 4,000 feet above the sea ; at one point near the Tennessee line it reaches a height of 5,530 feet; its general elevation is about 2,500, but its outline is very irregular. Numerous streams have their origin in the gorges of the Blue Ridge, and most of them then flow across Piedmont to the southeast until near its border, where they unite and form one that runs for a considerable distance along and parallel to the Coast Mountains, and takes the name of some of the well-known rivers that cross Middle and even Tidewater Virginia, like the Roanoke or Staunton, and the James. Some of these rivers break through the Blue Ridge fronr the Valley, making water gaps in that for midable mountain barrier, as the Potomac, the James and the Roanoke ; but they all follow the rule above given in their way across this section. This is a genuine \" Piedmont \" country \u2014 one in which the mountains present themselves in their grand as well as in their diminutive forms \u2014 gradually sinking down into the plains, giving great diversity and picturesqueness to the landscape. Few countries surpass this in beauty of scenery and choice of prospect, so it has always been a favorite section with men of refinement in which to fix their homes. Its population is 31 to the square mile, giving some 21 acres each. The Great Valley of Virginia Is the belt of limestone land west of the Blue Ridge, and between it and the numerous interrupted ranges of mountains, with various local names, that run parallel to it on the west at an average distance of some twenty miles, that collectively are called the Kitatinny or North Mountains. This valley extends in West Virginia and Virginia for more than 330 miles from the Potomac to the Tennessee line, and 305 miles of this splendid"], [457, "PHILIP W. McKINNEY. 419 country are within the limits of Virginia. The county lines generally extend fronr the top of the Blue Ridge to the top of the second or third mountain range beyond the Valley proper, so that the political Valley is somewhat larger than the natural one, which has an area of about 6,000 square miles, while the former has 7,550, and a population of twenty-six to the square mile. The latitude of the Valley is from 36\u00b0 35' N. to 390 26' ; its longitude is from 77\u00b0 50' to 80\u00b0 16' W. While this is one continuous valley clearly defined by its bounding mountains, it is not the valley of one river, or of one system of rivers, but of five ; so that it has four water-sheds and four river troughs in its length along the Valley from the Potomac to the Tennessee line. These valleys and their length in the Great Valley, are from the northeast\u2014 ist. The Shenandoah Valley I35 mjies 2d. The James River A'alley 50 \" 3d. The Roanoke River Valley 38 \" 4th. The Kanawha or New River Valley 54 \" 5th. The Valley of the Holston or Tennessee 52 \" 330 miles As a whole, the Valley rises to the southwest, being 242 feet above the tide where the Shenandoah enters the Potomac and the united rivers break through the Blue Ridge at Harper's Ferry, and 1,687 feet where the waters of the Holston leave the State and pass into Tennessee. The entire Valley appears then as a series of ascending and descending planes, slop ing to the northeast or the southwest. That of the Shenandoah rises from 242 to 1,863 feet along the line of its main stream, in 136 miles, looking northeast ; those of the James slope both ways, from the Shenandoah sum mit to the southwest, and from the Roanoke summit to the northeast, and so on. This arrangement gives this seventh great step a variety of eleva tions above the sea from 242 to 2,594 feet, or even 3,000, in a great enclosed valley, subdivided into very many minor valleys, giving \" facings \" in all directions; for the whole Valley has a very decided southeastern inclina tion, to be considered in this connection, its western side being from 500 to 1,000 feet in surface elevation above its eastern, presenting its mass to the sun, giving its streams a tendency to flow across it toward the east, as the result of its combined slopes, and making the main drainage way hug the western base of the Blue Ridge. A moment's reflection will show that this is a well-watered country, having a wealth of water-power and drain- age and irrigation resources almost beyond estimate. The aspect of this region is exceedingly pleasant. The great width of the Valley ; the singular coloring, and wavy, but bold outline of the Blue Ridge ; the long, uniform lines of the Alleghany Mountains, and the high knobs that rise up behind them in the distance ; the detached ranges that often extend for nrany miles in the midst of the Valley like huge lines of fortification \u2014 all these for the outline, filled up with park-like forests, well-cultivated farms, well-built towns, and threaded by bright and abounding rivers, make this a charming and inviting region."], [458, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 420 The Blue Ridge Section, For two thirds of its length of 310 miles, is embraced in the Valley and Piedmont counties that have their common lines upon its watershed ; it is only the southwestern portion of it, where it expands into a plateau, with an area of some 1,230 square miles, that forms a separate political division ; still the whole range and its numerous spurs, parallel ridges, detached knobs and foot hills, varying in width from 3 to 20 miles, embracing nearly 2,500 square miles of territory, is a distinct region, not only in appearance but in all essential particulars. The river, in the gorge where the Potomac breaks through the Blue Ridge, is 242 feet above tide. The Blue Ridge there attains an elevation of 1,460 feet. Mt. Marshall, near and south of Front Royal, is 3,369 feet high; the notch, Rockfish Gap, at the Chesa peake and Ohio Railroad, is 1,996 feet, and James River, where it passes through the Ridge, is 706 feet above tide, or more than twice as high as the Potomac at its passage. The Peaks of Otter, in Bedford County, arc 3,993 feet, and the Balsam Mountain, in Grayson, is 5,700 feet, and in North Carolina this range is nearly 7,000 feet above the sea level. These figures show that this range increases in elevation as we go southwest, and every portion of the country near rises in the same manner. At a little distance this range is generally of a deep blue color. The whole mountain range may be characterized as a series of swelling domes, connected by long ridges meeting between the high points in gaps or notches, and send ing out long spurs in all directions from the general range, but more especially on the eastern side, these in turn sending out other spurs, giving a great development of surface and variety of exposure. The political division upon the plateau of the Blue Ridge is the counties of Floyd, Carroll and Grayson, all watered by the Kanawha, or New River, and its branches, a tributary of the Ohio, except the litde val ley in the southwest corner of Grayson, which sends its waters to the Ten nessee. The population of this romantic section is 23 to the square mile. Appalachian Virginia Succeeds the Valley on the west. It is a mountain country, traversed its whole length by the Appalachian or Alleghany system of mountains. It may be considered as a series of comparatively narrow, long, parallel val leys, running northeast and southwest, separated from each other by mountain ranges that are, generally, equally narrow, long and parallel, and quite elevated. In crossing this section to the northwest, at right angles to its mountains and valleys, in fifty miles one will cross from six to ten of these mountain ranges, and as many valleys. As before stated, a strip of this region is embraced in the Valley counties, as they include the two or three front ranges that have drainage into the Valley ; so that some 900 square miles of Appalachia are politically classed with the Valley, leaving 5,720 square miles to be treated of here. This, in Virginia, is an"], [459, "PHILIP W. McKINNEY. 421 irregular belt of country 260 miles long, varying in width from 10 to 50 miles. Its waters, generally, flow northeast and southwest, but it has basins that drain north and northwest, and south and southeast. The heads of the valleys are generally frorrr 2,000 to 2,800 feet above tide, and the waters often flow fronr each way to a central depression \u2014 that is, from 600 to 1,200 feet above sea level \u2014 before they unite and break through the enclosing ranges. The remarks made concerning the slopes of the Great Valley apply also to this section, except that the Appalachian valleys are straighter. Appalachia is noted as a grazing country, its elevation giving it a cool, moist atmosphere, admirably adapted, with its fertile soil, to the growth of grass and the rearing of stock of all kinds. The geological formations found in Virginia, like its geographical divisions, succeed each other in belts, either complete or broken, nearly parallel to the coast of the Atlantic. In fact, the geographical divisions of the State that have already been given correspond in the main to the dif ferent geological formations, and have been suggested by them; hence, those divisions are natural. The formations developed in Virginia, taken in the order in which they succeed each other and cover the surface, or form the rocks found with the surface, from the Atlantic at the Virginia capes to the northwest across the State, are as follows : Tidewater. \u2014 1. Quarter-nary; 2. Upper Tertiary ; 3. Middle Tertiary ; 4. Lower Tertiary. Middle. \u2014 5. Triassic and Jurassic ; 6. Azoic and Gra nitic. Piedmont. \u2014 7. Azoic, Epidotic, etc. Blue Ridge. \u2014 8. Azoic and Cambrian. The Valley. \u2014 9. Cambrian and Silurian. Appalachia. \u2014 10. Sub-carboniferous and Devonian; 11. Silurian; 12. Devonian and Sub carboniferous ; 13. Great Carboniferous. The character of the soils of Virginia, as of other countries, is depend ent upon its geology. The mineral resources of the State may be summed up as consisting \u2014 In Tidewater Virginia Of several kinds of marls, greensand, etc., highly esteemed as fertilizers ; of choice clays, sands and shell limestone, for building purposes. In the Middle Section Of fine granites, gneiss, brownstone, sandstone, brick-clays, fire-clays, soap-stones, marble, slates, etc., for building materials ; epidote in various forms and limestone for fertilizing uses; gold, silver, copper, specular, magnetic, hematite and other ores of iron in abundance; bituminous coal, etc."], [460, "422 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. In Piedmont Virginia Granitic building stones, marbles, sandstones, brick and fire-clays; epi dotic rocks and limestone, for improving the soil ; magnetic, hematite aud other ores of iron ; barytes, lead, manganese, etc. In the Blue Ridge District Various and abundant ores of copper ; immense deposits of specular and brown hematite and other iron ores ; greenstone rocks, rich in all the ele ments of fertility ; sandstones and freestones ; glass sand and manganese ; brick and fire-clays. In the Valley Limestones of all kinds, for buildiug and agricultural uses ; marbles, slates, freestones and sandstones; brick and fire-clays, kaolin, barytes; hematite, iron ores, lead and zinc in abundance ; tin, semi-anthracite coal, travertine marls, etc. In the Appalachian Country Limestones, marbles, sand and freestone ; slates, calcareous marls, brick clays, etc.; various deposits of red, brown and other ores of iron, plaster, salt, etc., and a large area of all varieties of bituminous coal. It is very difficult, within the limits of a publication like this, to pre sent with anything like detail a fair statement of the enormous mineral resources of the State. For all practical purposes, they are boundless in extent, and their distribution is such as to warrant the assertion that before the close of the present century the aggregate product of our miues will surpass in value those of any other State in the Union. Between the Atlantic coast and the western botrndaries of the State, the whole \"geological column\" is represented, from the foundation gran ite to the capstones of the upper carboniferous. And in these successive strata are found the rocks and minerals peculiar to each all over the world, and usually in greater abundance and of greater excellence than anywhere else within the same area. It would require the space of a large volume to indicate all the locali ties where these underground treasures are now known to exist, and to describe their specific qualities and estimate their quantities. In 1891 the Commissioner of Agriculture reported from statistics that\u2014 \" In Virginia there have been found, tested and developed, immense deposits of minerals richer than in any other land. The coke from her immense coal fields is higher in fixed carbon and more valuable for smelt ing than any other, and has been carried hundreds of miles by rail to make cheap iron in other States. Her iron for steel, for cannon, for car wheels, for stoves, etc., has been given upon test the highest place. Her immense deposits of manganese stand before the world without a rival. Her zinc has long had a reputation based on a large contract with the Ital-"], [461, "PHIL/P W. McKINNEY. 423 ian Government, and both the mines and the smelting are increasing. Her granite was accepted by the Federal Government for building after an official test, and the finest pavements in many cities of our sister States are of her Belgian block. Her large deposits of magnesian lime still fur nish the celebrated James River cement. \" Her Buckingham slate stands without a rival in roofing. These all have had official and practical tests. \"Add to these, minerals that have been developed and believed to have shown paying quality and quantity, the pyrite of Louisa, mica of Amelia, fire-clay and ochre of Chesterfield, gold of the middle counties, baryta, soapstone, lead, copper, tin, asbestos, plumbago, kaolin, gypsum, salt, lime, marble, lithographic stone and many others, and Virginia may well be proud of her mineral wealth.\" Iron. More than half the counties of the State contain mines of iron ore in ample quantities to give employment to thousands of men for ages yet to come. The varieties in different localities are \u2014 Magnetites (magnetic ore, so called because of its polarity, or myste rious power of attracting the magnetic needle). Limonites (more commonly called brown hematite), and Specular, or red hematite ores. Professor McCreath, in his \"Mineral Wealth of Virginia,\" says of the iron ores of Southwest Virginia : \"This iron ore region is for the most part embraced in Pulaski, Wythe, and Smyth Counties, in Southwest Virginia. The ores lie on both sides of New River and Cripple Creek, and the railroad line following these streams renders the whole ore supply practically available for market. ' ' The limestone ores of the Cripple Creek region show as high a gen eral character as any brown hematite ores mined in the country. The result of numerous analyses shows an average richness in metallic iron Of over 54 per cent, in the ore dried at 2120 F., with about one tenth of one per cent, of phosphorus. This unusually fine character is found to be very uniform through all the numerous mines and outcrops examined. It is somewhat extraordinary that not only is there this regularity in the per centage of iron, but also that the phosphorus shows a great uniformity in specimens taken widely apart ; and in no case has it been found to exceed two tenths of one per cent. The quality of the ore is such that it smelts very easily in the furnace, and it should require a minimum amount of both flux and fuel. ' ' The quantity of iron ore in the Cripple Creek region is undoubtedly very great. The limestone deposits occur in clefts and cavities of the limestone mixed with clay; but in this district, rarely with any flint."], [462, "424 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. The method of occurrence is such that the banks will yield widely varying quantities of ore. Some of them have been worked for many years, and shafts are reported to have been sunk ioo feet in ore-bearing clays with bottom of shaft still in ore. Frequently the ore-bearing material is of unusual richness, yielding in the washer fully one half clean ore.\" Coal. In the immediate vicinity of Richmond, lying on both sides of James River, the lougest worked coal field in the United States exists. The coal is bituminous, and has long been esteemed as an excellent domestic fuel, and for foundry and blacksmith work, and the generation of steam. Coal was shipped from this field to Philadelphia before the Pennsylvania mines were worked. The field is from ten to twelve miles wide, and from thirty to forty in length, and in many places the seams are of enormous thick ness. As a convenient supply to Richmond and towns and vessels on James River, this coal is an important element of wealth in the State. Over a million tons were taken from this field in twenty years \u2014 from 1822 to 1845. Coal has been said to be discovered in Amelia County, and has been worked with some success in Cumberland County near Farmville, and coal is being developed in Powhatan and Goochland. Little veins of cannel coal have been found in Chesterfield, specimens of which have been brought to the Department of Agriculture. So far the only certain large deposits of this beautiful coal are in the County of Wise, a part of the great coal fields of the Southwest reaching into Kentucky and West Virginia. In Botetourt, Pulaski, Montgomery, and Wythe Counties are some what extensive deposits of a semi-anthracite coal of local importance and value, furnishing a good domestic fuel. It is also used in the great zinc reduction works at Pulaski, and at the salt works in Washington County. In Rockingham and Augusta Counties are some irregular scams of true anthracite, but their extent and commercial value have not been determined. A Pennsylvania company is now working in Rockingham County. The great Virginia coal field lies in the Counties of Tazewell, Russell, Buchanan, Dickenson, Wise, Lee and Scott. In these counties from eight hundred to one thousand square nriles are underlaid with numerous seams of as pure and rich bituminous and cannel coal as have been found in the world. The bituminous coals proper cover the whole area mentioned\u2014 the splint more than two thirds of it, and the cannel coal a much smaller and as yet undetermined area. These coals are in the Lower and Middle pro ductive measures. At Pocahoutas, in Tazewell, where the mines now yield about one million tons per annum, only the Lower measures are worked, where a coal similar to that on New River, in West Virginia, is found in much larger seams than in West Virginia. In Russell, Buchanan, Dick enson, Wise, Lee and Scott, there are generally four, but in some' places"], [463, "PHILIP W. McKINNEY. 425 six seams of unsurpassed coal for all purposes, including coking coals that make a coke seven per cent, richer in carbon and freer from sulphur and ash than the celebrated Connellsville coke of Pennsylvania, and four per cent, better than the Alabama coke, that is so rapidly building up a vast iron production in that State. Several railroads to and through this immense storage of the best fuel for metallurgical purposes, for gas pro duction, steam and domestic use, are projected, aud one is built. The companies are organized, and there is every indication that within the next ten years the development in that section of the State will surpass anything in its history. The best of the iron ores above mentioned are in close proximity to these coals; and the agricultural resources of that part of the State are adequate to the support of an immense industrial popula tion. Prior to 1883, comparatively litde coal was mined in Virginia, the output of 1S80 being less than 50,000 tons, but during that year the Flat Top coal regions were opened up mainly by the Southwest Virginia Improvement Company, the Norfolk and Western Railroad having been extended to this section. In 1883 this company mined 99,871 tons of coal, and in 1884, 283,252 tons. There are now several other companies developing coal mines in the same territory, and the prospects are good for a very important coal mining interest growing up in that section. The coal is of excellent quality both for steam purposes and for coke making, and as the Norfolk and Western Railroad Company have built at Norfolk, Va., one of the largest coal piers in the world for shipping this coal, there is no doubt that there will be a large increase in the amount of coal produced at these mines during the next few years. This will naturally result in making Norfolk an important coal shipping port and coaling station for foreign steamships. The distance from these mines to Norfolk is about 378 miles. For coking purposes, this coal as already stated, has proved very satisfactory. This statement was made in 1886. It may with safety be predicted that in a few years Virginia will take an important rank as a coal-producing State. And she will moreover have two important coal ports: Norfolk receiving and shipping the steadily increasing quantity of coal brought from the Flat Top coal field by the Norfolk and Western Railroad, and Newport News, already doing a heavy business in West Virginia coal, mined along the line of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Zinc. At Pulaski City, on the Norfolk and Western Railroad, in Southwestern Virginia, are located the largest zinc works in the South, with a supply of ore ascertained to be millions of tons. In numerous other localities in the same section of the state this valuable metal is found, and doubtless will lead to the erection of other works."], [464, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 426 Lead. In Wythe County lead has been extensively mined for over a hundred years. These mines were worked in 1773, and more than twenty millions of tons have been taken from them. The crude ore is found in veins in the limestone, yielding from 5 to 15 per cent. At present the largest lead works in the South are carried on there, with an apparently exhaustless supply to draw from. In some sections other mines of great value have been found, and means are on foot to develop some of them. Manganese. Manganese is found widely disseminated through Virginia in the form of black oxide and as manganiferous iron ore. The nrost productive man ganese mine now worked in the United States is that of the Crimora Company, Augusta County, at the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains on the west, near Waynesboro. Other deposits, that are thought to be as large, have recently been brought to light within a few miles of Crimora, between the Shenandoah Valley Railroad and the Blue Ridge. Tin. In Rockbridge County, tin has been found, with indications that the mines are extensive. The quality of the ore has been ascertained by analysis to be excellent, and it is expected from the openings now made, that the quantity will be sufficient to insure adequate capital for the full development of the mines. ' ' The tin field is located in a small area in the eastern part of Rockbridge County, Virginia. The region is very accessible from nearly all directions. \"The Irish Creek area within which tin ore has been found is about three miles wide from northwest to southeast, and about four miles long fronr northeast to southwest, and therefore embraces some twelve square miles of territory. It is near three lines of railways. \"The geological and mineralogical conditions of the Irish Creek tin bearing region are similar to, if not identical with, those of the Cornwall (England) and other noted tin-producing districts. There are the same crystalline and metaphoric rocks, broken, fissured, and faulted by dikes of trap, basalt, and other igneous rocks, thus furnishing similar conditions for the fornration of true, profitable, metalliferous fissure veins, such as are caused by profound movements of the earth's crust\u2014just such veins as those in which stanniferous ores of the Irish Creek district are found. \"The exposure of the Irish Creek tin veins, both natural and artificial, unmistakably leads to the conclusion that these veins compare in general character, extent, thickness and richness in metallic tin most favorably with those of the famous Cornwall district of England, while the mining conditions are better. I nray add that no region can offer superior advan tages for extensive mining and metallurgical operations ; the climate is all"], [465, "PHILIP W. McKINNEY. 427 the year round salubrious and favorable for work. The Blue Ridge proper of Virginia, unlike most mountain chains, is a very garden of fertility and varied productiveness, and the same may be said of Piedmont Virginia, that flanks it on the east, and of the famous limestone valley that flanks it on the west. The forests of this region can be depended on for charcoal, and it is not far by direct railway to the best metal-working and coking coals in the United States. ' ' Copper. In Carroll, Floyd, and Grayson Counties, large veins of copper ores, sulphurets and carbonates exist, and prior to the war some of them were successfully worked. But their remoteness from railway lines has deterred capitalists from re-establishing these mining operations. There is some prospect that at an early day a railroad will penetrate that region , and lead to the re-opening of these valuable mines. In several of the Piedmont counties copper ores are known to exist, but the mines have never been operated, except in Loudoun and Amherst, where much valuable ore has been raised and shipped to the North, and considerable quantities of native copper ores have been gotten as a by product from the pyrites of the Arminius mines in Louisa County. Copper has been discovered in at least eighteen counties in Virginia, and in many of them considerably developed. Salt. In conjunction with the strata banks of north Holston Valley the celebrated wells of salt exist that have been used for about a century at Saltville, in Washington County, and during the late Civil War supplied nearly the whole Confederacy east of the Mississippi with the indispens able article of salt, of the greatest purity. No diminution in supply or quality has ever been detected. The production now is about half a mil lion bushels annually. The rock at Saltville, possibly 200 feet thick by an unknown length, may have a different origin from that of the gypsum\u2014 possibly may be due to deposition in a secure basin from brines flowing constantly from the salt-bearing groups of rocks known to be in the sub-carboniferous series. The brines are of an unusual degree of purity ; have been drawn upon for many years by the salt works of Saltville, making over 500,000 bushels of salt annually, without any appreciable diminution of either strength or quantity. The brine is drawn from artesian wells about 200 feet deep, rising to within forty feet of the surface. This brine comes from a solid bed of rock salt 200 feet below the level of the Holston, and borings have been made into it 176 feet without passing through it. The supply of brine is not affected by any operations yet carried on, and at one time during the Con federate War 10,000 bushels of salt were made there every day for six"], [466, "428 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. months. The present yield is about 360,000 bushels a year, using wood for fuel. When improvements contenrplated bring the coal that is but 40 miles off to these works, there will be a very large amount of salt made here, as it has the advantage of being so far inlaud. The copper ores of Floyd County make it possible to here locate suc cessfully alkali works. Professor Leibig nrentions the fact that a well has been bored in Tazewell County, and adds: \"It must be borne in mind that the salt wells of Eastern Kentucky get their water from the conglom erate at the bottom of the coal measures.\" Therefore, there must be a salt-water bearing fornration several hundred feet below the coal bed at the bottom of this lode. Salt has been made at works in the southeastern part of Lee County, on the waters of Clinch River. There is no doubt an abundance of brine, throughout the region in the fornration above named. Asbestos. Asbestos of good quality and workable quantity exists in the counties lying between the upper James and the upper Dan rivers, at several places, notably in Pittsylvania, Henry and Patrick, and latterly found in several other counties, ver}' fine specimens of which can be seen in the cabinet of the Department of Agriculture. Asbestos in its various formations has been recently developed in Bedford County, and is found in large quanti ties and of good quality. In the Blue Ridge division asbestos is found in connection with most of the mineral formations. In Roanoke and Bote tourt it is very white and pure, though the fibre is short. In Buckingham the fibre is very long and flexible, but the color is not so good, but the specimens were taken near the surface. It is said to have been found in Amelia, Fairfax, Fauquier, Patrick and Pittsylvania. Soapstone. Steatite (soapstone) of fine quality for resisting the most intense heat, is found in Amelia, Albemarle, and some other counties of Middle and Piedmont Virginia. In Amelia a mine of steatite was successfully oper ated a few miles from the county seat. One fornration of it is very much like serpentine, and resists heat successfully. It is frequently called pot stone, and was said to have been cut by the Indiaus into pots. Two veins are found in Campbell County, both crossing the James River from Amherst about ten miles apart. The western one is a beautiful green, cuts easily, and hardens by exposure, and makes handsome building stone. The east ern vein is very light grey, polishes well, resists heat, and is much used for fire-places. Albemarle has large veins of steatite, which are being worked and marketed successfully at North Garden. The veins of steatite run across the state from northeast to southwest. They appear to follow a kind of glade formation, a few miles in width, though other veins are sometimes found outside this line."], [467, "PHILIP W. McKINNEY. 429 Black Lead. Plumbago (black lead) is found in Amelia, Patrick, Amherst, Camp bell, Loudoun, Louisa, Albemarle and other counties. Some deposits are ver}' pure and large in quantity. It appears irregularly in different parts of the state. In some localities it has been tested by analysis, in others manufactured into pencils, and in others as a lubricant. Mica. The mica of Amelia has been more largely worked than any in Vir ginia. It is very abundant, and mines have been profitably worked for some years past. In the vicinity of the county seat are the Rutherford, Jefferson and Pinchback mines. Others exist in the same locality, not yet in operation to much extent. It is also to some extent developed in Goochland, Henrico, Louisa, Pulaski, Powhatan and Hanover. Near Irwin station, in Goochland, the deposit is being worked, which is of the finest quality, and the largest sheets yet found. A recent report says that large quantities have been taken out and prepared for market. A similar deposit has been found and partially developed in Hanover. Both are very convenient to railroads. Gold. There is a well-defined belt of gold-bearing quartz running across the state through the Counties of Prince William, Stafford, Spotsylvania, Lou isa, Fluvanna, Goochland, Buckingham, Prince Edward, Charlotte and Halifax. In many places on this belt mines have been opened front time to time, and worked with profit and success. With the progress of scien tific improvement in the extraction of gold, it may fairly be expected that gold mining in Virginia will become an extensive industry. This precious metal has also been found in Montgomery County. And in the Blue Ridge range of mountains, in Roanoke and Patrick Counties, silver ores have recently been found that give promise of valuable results. Professor Stowe (from a letter written by him in 1873, just aster his return from California and Colorado), regarding his estimate of the value of the Virginia mines, says: \" I am now of the decided opinion that the ores of Virginia are the richest and easiest to work of any I have ever met. I have made over two hundred assays of ore from the Atlantic slope, and have visited in person many of the localities where gold is found, and I speak fronr facts.\" This is a strong opinion coming from an expert min ing engineer. Major Hotchkiss writes of this belt, including Buckingham : \"Here is a mass of precious metal (enclosed in the rock) which cannot be ex hausted for ages, and in this respect the region in question is the most important of all known deposits, California not excepted. ' ' The celebrated Overman (practrcal mineralogist) says : \"We have here in Virginia a belt"], [468, "430 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. of gold of unparalleled extent, immense width, undoubtedly reaching to the primitive rock.\" In the earlier days very large nuggets were found by breaking up the quartz rocks with sledge-hammers. One of these, in Spotsylvania, sold for $438. It was not unusual for farmers, after they laid by their crops, to direct the overseer to take \"the hands\" and mine or wash for gold; and there were times when thousands of dollars were made per annum this way. Stafford, Spotsylvania, Orange, Fluvanna, Goochland and Buckingham were regarded gold fields. In several, work is now going on. Pyrites. Immense miues of pyrites are worked in Louisa County, and the products shipped North, for the use of sulphuric acid manufactories. So important has this industry become, that branch railroads have been run to the mines from the main line of the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad. Other large deposits exist in the mountain regions bordering on North Carolina, but need a railroad for their development. New veins of this, the \"fool's gold\" of the Colonies, are being discovered, and developed, and opened in different parts of the State. Some are valuable for the gold and other metals found in these sulphurets, and this by-product taken in connection with the large quantity of sulphur found in all, and the increasing demand for sulphuric acid, is likely to turn this into a true gold so far as sure profit is concerned. Two fully developed and profitably worked mines are near Tolersville (Mineral City), in Louisa County. One, the Armenius mine, has been sunk over four hundred feet, and the Cren shaw, the other mine, though not so deep, is fully worked. The by-product secured is native copper ore. Sulphuric acid is made in the City of Richmond, in two chemical works, for use in the manufacture of fertilizers. Large quantities are shipped North from the Armenius mines. Valuable veins of pyrite, bearing gold in fairly paying quantities, and probably other metals, have been found at other points in Louisa County, and in Spotsylvania, Fluvanna, Goochland, Buckingham and some other counties. Barytes. The barytes of commerce (sulphate of barium) is found in many counties. It has been mined in Campbell and Bedford, and is ground in Lynchburg and shipped North. It is also found in the Southwest, abun dantly in Smyth County. Limestone. Metamorphic limestones exist in the valley of James River, between Richmond and Lynchburg. Silurian limestone extends fronr the Potomac to Tennessee, in great variety. Since the discovery that building lime with a large percentage of the carbonate of magnesia, is a poor material to"], [469, "PHILIP W. McKINNEY. 431 use in the mortar of large buildings and other permanent works of masonry and brick, peculiar value attaches to beds of pure carbonate of lime. Such beds fortunately exist at convenient localities in the great Shenandoah Valley, and lime-burning is already carried on there at two points\u2014 Riverton, in Warren County, and Eagle Rock, in Botetourt\u2014 where an article is produced entirely free from magnesia, and is in great demand for city work, where the sulphurous fumes of coal combustion are so destructive to magnesian-lime mortar. As this pure limestone exists in many places, the industry is a rapidly-growing and a profitable one. Most excellent hydraulic cement has been produced for many years and in large quantity, at Balcony Falls, in Rockbridge County. The stone is also found in Bedford, near Buford's Gap, but has not been utilized until recently. All the various limestones, from the most common building-rock to the finest marble, are found in Virginia. Her dolamite limestone has been found so superior for fluxing certain iron ores, that it has been carried considerable distances by rail, in preference to using common limestone on the ground. Virginia may be said to be an agricultural lime State. The whole Valley has the best limestone for burning. The whole of Tidewater has shell (carbonate) marl. A good vein of limestone runs across Upper, Middle and Lower Piedmont. Several of the carbonate marls, mixed with clay, will, by being calcined, make cement like the Portland that is made in England. The travertine marl of the Valley, and the highly aluminous clays of that section, should make such cements very cheaply. Plaster (Gypsum.) On the waters of the north fork of Holston River, in the Counties of Smyth and Washington, there are many miles in length of an immense ledge of gypsum, as pure as that brought from Nova Scotia. It has been penetrated to the depth of nearly 600 feet, and no bottom found. We have here a quantity of this valuable fertilizer, that is practically exhaust less for centuries to come. This massive deposit of gypsum, more than 600 feet thick, at Stuart and Buchanan's Cove, in Smyth County, shows conspicuously; also, at the Pearson Beds, and at Saltville, in Smyth County, and at Buena Vista, in Washington County. Many explorations and long continued examina tions led to the belief, at last, that these vast gypsum deposits, showing for about 20 miles in length, really compose two or more regular strata of the sub-carboniferous rocks, and have a width, exposed and concealed, of one mile or more from the fault northward. It has been mined to the depth of about 180 feet at Saltville and Buena Vista, and its general com position by analysis is as follows: Lime, 32.50; sulphuric acid, 46.50, and water, 20.50, showing traces of magnesia, alumina, and iron. Plaster for clover, grass, and tobacco is universally used by the farmers of the Valley, Piedmont, and Upper Middle Virginia, sowed"], [470, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 432 direcdy on the land \u2014 preferring ground plaster to calcined. Grinding plaster gives a number of mills to the State. Even the Nova Scotia that comes to the Eastern section is ground in the State. Smyth and Wash ington Counties could furnish plaster for the country if they had deep water transportation. Marl. In many of the Tidewater counties enormous beds of blue and green sand marl and shells are found but a few feet below the surface, supplying a fertilizing material at a nominal cost, that is rapidly converting all that region into the garden spot of the continent for supplying the great cities of the Atlantic coast with table vegetables of the highest excellence, and is giving much importance to the peanut culture. A full description of the geological formation of this alluvial region would not be interesting to the unscientific reader, but it may be well to call attention to the difference between the marls of the more recent formations, the pliocene and miocene, which derive their value mainly from the carbonate of lime which they contain, and the green sands and olive earths which are found in the eocene in conjunction with the shell or calcareous marl. (Green sand is sometimes found mixed with the marl of the miocene region.) The region of eocene marls extends from the falls of the rivers east ward fifteen to twenty miles. Miocene marl is often found overlying the eocene, and is easily recognized by the difference in the shells which it contains \u2014 scallops and others not found in the eocene. ' ' Beneath this (Pro fessor Rogers, quoted by Dr. Pollard, says), and usually separated from it by a thin line of 'black pebbles,' like those occurring on the Pamunkey, there occurs a stratum of greenish, red, and yellow aspect, containing much green sand and gypsum, the latter partly disseminated in small grains, and partly grouped in large crystals. The under stratum, rich in green sand and containing a few shells in friable condition, extends to some depth below the level of the river. At ' Evergreen ' the whole thickness of the deposit appears to be about twenty feet.\" This was said of the James River formation, but will apply as a gen eral description to the deposits of the Pamunkey, Mattaponi, Rappahan nock, and Potomac, as Professor Rogers says \"eocene marl is there found very similar to that on the James. On the Mattaponi the occurrence of green sand strata has been ascertained in some places, while in others the beds containing the substance have been replaced by beds of clay, which are less likely to prove valuable agriculturally. The olive earth overlying some of these beds, particularly on the Pamunkey, seems to have lost some of the carbonate of lime which it once contained, and has but a small portion of gypsum.\" The agricultural report for 1888, speaking of Tidewater Virginia, says : Not only has this section been blessed with lime beds, brought up"], [471, "PHILIP W. McKINNEY. 433 by all its streams from the ocean, placing this valuable deposit of miocene marl at its doors, but the Rappahannock, the North and South Annas, the James and Appomattox, rising in the felspar and hornblende ridges and valleys of Piedmont, and the black rock of Buckingham and Appomattox crossing through the pyrites and sulphur ledge, have brought down the pot ash and mingled it with these sulphates, carrying them to meet the tide, bringing the shells and fossil bones from the ocean. These, and the dead marine animals and their coprolites, formed the eocene marl beds, where the sulphates and shells made sulphate of lime (plaster \u2014 the great Ruffin's \"gypseous earth\"), and the potash and fossils gave the green sand its agricultural value. The lands on the Pamunkey and James that were heavily marled with the Pamunkey and James River green sand, are fertile and productive today, although for more than twenty-five years they have had neither manure or fertilizer. These marls have been tested by chemical analysis and agricultural experience, and the value of Virginia shell marl as an agricultural lime, aud the green sand marl as an active fertilizer, is put beyond the possibility of a doubt. There is considerable interest manifested now in the marl deposit of the State. The value of green sand as a basis for high-grade commer cial fertilizers, and of the carbonate marls and adjacent clays for cements, has caused extensive investigation. There are works on James River and the Pamunkey, preparing green sand marl for sale, now in operation with good profit. Building Stone and Slate. Virginia stands first among the States in the variety and beauty of her building stones, beginning with her granites and slates in Eastern Vir ginia, and extending to her limestones in the West, her brownstones in the Eastern counties, her marbles in Bedford, Russell, and Scott Counties, and ending with the beautiful sandstones of the Southwestern coal field, in half dozen counties. Virginia can make an exhibit in this line of which any country might be proud. At Petersburg are beautiful light and dark granites, in inex haustible quarries. At Richmond and Manchester, on opposite sides of James River, at the head of tide, are the great quarries that stood the test of stone made by the Government for the Naval Department at Washing ton. At Fredericksburg is fine granite, and near there the beautiful white sandstone of which the ' ' White House ' ' was built. The brown sandstone of Prince William, Botetourt, Nelson, Craig, and Albemarle will compare favorably with the best anywhere. Roofing slate of excellent quality is found on both sides of James River. That found in Buckingham, near New Canton, on Slate River, yields slate that compares favorably with the best qualities of imported material, both in density, texture, and capacity for resisting atmospheric changes. The XXIX"], [472, "THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. 434 Capitol and University buildings have been covered with this slate, and the quarries have been extensively worked. The rock splits with great regularity and may be separated with iron wedges into sheets of ioo square feet, not more than one inch thick. In Nelson County, on Rockfish and near the mouth of Tye River, a true marble is found, of beautiful quality, whiteness, and texture, which renders it susceptible of taking the highest polish. This marble is easily worked with the chisel. In Campbell, a few miles from Lynchburg, a good marble is found. Limestone is also abundant. Amherst and Albe marle have slate quarries, which have been worked, furnishing good roofing and admirable furniture slate. Loudoun has the finest white marble, and Botetourt the finest black marble, yet discovered in the State. Litho graphic stone has been found and tested in the James River valley, in the Counties of Botetourt, Rockbridge, and Alleghany, and a species of steatite of beautiful green stone suitable for building has been found in several counties. Virginia abounds in most valuable building stones. Kaolin. Kaolin has been discovered in Amelia, Fauquier, Fluvanna, Pow hatan, Louisa, Chesterfield, Amherst, Nelson, and other counties. It has been developed and analyzed in several of the counties, but it is not worked to any extent or mined. By both analyses and working tests Vir ginia kaolin has been found to be of high quality. Fire-Clays. Fire-clay has been found developed and is being worked in Chester field, at Robious ; at Dorset, in Powhatan ; at Buena Vista, in Rockbridge, and very fine bricks were on exhibition at the Virginia State fair recently. Vitrified brick is made at Chilhowie, in Smyth County, and clay has been found and developed in Louisa County. There are fine tile and brick works at Chester ; terra-cotta and porcelain works at Strasburg, in the Valley, and Virginia has in large quantity the finest clays of every variety. Clays and marl are found in close proximity, and in some places inter mixed, which, calcined, make a fine cement, like the Portland and Roman. Mineral Springs, There are numerous mineral springs in Virginia, varying in many particulars, and they are all valuable. Many of these springs are popu lar resorts for pleasure seekers from all parts of the country. Professor Rogers says in his geological report: \"The thermal waters appear to be indebted for their impregnation to rocks of a calcareous nature, while the sulphuretted springs derive their ingredients mostly from the pyritous"], [473, "PHILIP W. McKINNEY. 435 slate, and that the Warm and Hot Springs discharge a considerable amount of free gas, consisting of carbonic acid and nitrogen.\" Grouped, as these springs are, at a moderate distance apart, present ing, within the same district, a variety of medicinal character, for which, in other countries, regions remote from each other require to be visited in succession, placed at a point equally accessible to the inhabitant of the sea-board and the great valley of the West, and situated in a region of grateful summer temperature, of a salubrious climate, and of picturesque and diversified natural beauties, they are now rapidly attaining a celeb rity and are destined ere long to vie with the long established ' ' character of the most noted watering places of the world.\" Climate. Virginia, as a whole, lies in the region of \"middle latitudes,\" between 36\u00b0 30' and 390 30' North, giving it a climate of \"means\" between the extremes of heat and cold incident to States south and north of it. If Virginia were a plain, the general character of the climate of the whole State would be much the same; but the \"relief\" of its surface varies, from that of some of its large peninsulas not more than ten or fifteen feet above the sea level, to that of large valleys more than two thousand feet above that level. Long ranges of mountains from three thousand to four thousand feet in height run entirely across the State, and the waters flow to all points of the compass. So diversified are the features of the surface of the State, within its borders may be found all possible exposures to the sun and general atmospheric movements. It follows from these circum stances that here must be found great variety of temperature, winds> moisture, rain and snowfall, beginning and ending of seasons, and all the periodical phenomena of vegetable and animal life, depending on \"the weather. ' ' The winds are the great agents nature employs to equalize and dis tribute temperature, moisture, etc. Virginia lies on the eastern side of the American continent and on the western shore of the Atlantic Ocean. It extends to and embraces many of the ranges of the Appalachian system of mountains, that run parallel to that ocean shore; therefore, it is subject not only to the general movement of winds, storms, etc., from west to east, peculiar to the region of the United States, but to modifications of that movement by the great mountain ranges. It is also subject to the great atmospheric movements from the Atlantic that, with a rotary motion, come up from the Tropics and move along the coast, extending their influence over the Tidewater and Middle regions of the State ; some times across Piedmont to the foot of the Blue Ridge, but rarely ever over or beyond that range. The numberless lines of mountains from the Blue Ridge to the Cumberland, all the way across its extent from up in Penn sylvania down into North Carolina unbroken, protect the State against the cold winds, and storms, and blizzards of the Northwest. This barrier is"], [474, "436 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. absolutely effectual ; they never reach this land. The peculiar formation of the Appalachian chain running southwest into South Carolina and Georgia, with ranges bearing west into Tennessee and Alabama, protect us from the cyclones that form in the heated waters of the Gulf and rush northeast. The formation of the southern end of this range of mountains turns the southwest storms and tornadoes either up the Cumberland range northeast or across the Gulf States to the Atlantic Ocean. It has also sur face winds, usually from the Southwest, that follow the trend of the mount ains and bring to them and their enclosed parallel valleys the warmth and moisture of the Gulf that clothes them all with an abundant vegetation. The same causes that produced the magnificent forests of the carbon iferous era and furnished the materials for the vast deposits of coal in the sixty thousand square miles of the great Appalachian coal field that flanks Virginia on the west, still operate and clothe the surface of the same region with an abundant vegetation. The laws of the winds make one region fertile and another barren. America owes its distinction as the Forest Continent to the situation of its land masses in reference to the pre vailing winds. Guyot, a standard authority, says: \" North America has in the east ern half a greater amount of rain than either of the other Northern conti nents in similar latitudes.\" . . \"The great sub-tropical basin of the Gulf of Mexico sends up into the air its wealth of vapors to replace those lost by the winds in crossing the high mountain chains. Hence, the east ern portions \u2014 the great basins of the Mississippi, and the St. Lawrence, and the Appalachian region \u2014 which, without this source of moisture, would be doomed to drought and barrenness, are the most abundantly watered and the most productive portions of the continent.\" \"In the eastern half of the United States the southwesterly winds which prevail in the summer spread over the interior and the Atlantic plains an abundant supply of vapors from the warm waters of the Gulf. Frequent, copious showers refresh the soil during the months of greatest heat, which show a maxi mum of rain. Thus the dry summers of the warm- temperate region dis appear, and with them the periodical character of the rains so well marked elsewhere in this belt. ' ' These quotations show the advantages Virginia has, in this respect, over the warm-temperate regions of Europe aud elsewhere. Forests. The forests of Virginia are large, and the timber varied, and the lumber trade important, and the following is a fair catalogue of the trees of Vir ginia now growing wild in the different sections : The oaks: White oak, post oak, swamp white oak, chestnut oak, yellow oak, red oak, scarlet oak, black oak, black-jack oak, Spanish oak, pin oak, willow oak, bear oak, bastard live oak, scrub white oak, water oak, turkey oak."], [475, "PHILIP W. McKINNEY. 437 The pines : The table mountain pine, white pine, pitch pine, Jersey scrub pine, yellow pine, loblolly pine, hemlock pine. Cypress, juniper, bay laurel, red cedar, white cedar (arbor vit\u00e6), umbrella tree, white wood (white poplar), yellow poplar, Lombardy pop lar, pawpaw (custard apple), linden, fringe tree, catalpa, sassafras, slippery elm, red elm, water elm, winged elm, sugar berry, horn beam, red mul berry, white mulberry, moris multicualis, sycamore, black walnut, white walnut (butternut), shellbark hickory, white hickory, red (mochermes) hickory, pignut hickory, butternut hickory, chinquepin, chestnut, beech, water beech, ironwood, cherry birch, red birch, black alder, holly, sugar ma ple, red maple, curled maple, bird-eye maple, box elder or ash-leaved maple, stag horn (sumac), poison elder (thunder tree), common locust, yellow (mountain) locust, honey locust, red bud (Judas tree), wild plum (Prunus Americanus), wild cherry\u2014 red (P.

Flowers. The flowers which cover the unfilled fields, and bloom and blush unseen in forest dells, form no small part of the beauty which makes this land of blue mountains and silvery streams \"the fairest land the sun shines on.\" In springtime every stream is fringed with blooming flowers and white banners wave on every breeze. Wild roses, ferns, rhododendrons, forest pinks, and wood violets spring up everywhere, while daisies and yellow buttercups line every pathway. Of cultivated flowers, everything grows in the open air that can be raised in a temperate climate. Fruits. Every portion of the State is remarkably well adapted to the growth of fruits that belong to the warm-temperate and temperate climates. In Tidewater Virginia, apples, pears, peaches, quinces, plums, cher ries, nectarines, grapes, figs, strawberries, raspberries, running and bush blackberries, gooseberries, currants and other fruits thrive and produce abundantly, the quality of the products being unsurpassed, as the awards of the American Pomological Society attest. The value of the small fruits alone, annually sent to market from Tidewater, is more than the sums for orchards and gardens. The trade in early strawberries is one of large proportions. Especial mention should be made of the wild Scuppernong"], [476, "438 THE GOVERNORS OF VIRGINIA. grapes, peculiar to the Tidewater country near the sea, which spread over the forests, and bear large crops of excellent fruit, from which a very palatable wine is made. The originals of the Catawba, Norton's Virginia, and other esteemed American grapes grow wild in the forests of Vir ginia. All the fruits named above grow in every section of the State, except, perhaps, figs. Piedmont, the Blue Ridge, and the Valley are famous apple regions. Peaches flourish in all sections, but Middle and Tidewater may claim some precedence in adaptability. The Blue Ridge is entitled to the name of the \"fruit belt,\" and its extensive area is yet to become the most noted wine and fruit-producing section of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. All the fruits of Virginia flourish there in a remarkable manner, and find special adaptations of soil, climate, and exposure. Cereals, Cotton, Tobacco The flora of Virginia is rich and abundant. Cereals, grasses, and other plants that have been introduced have found favorable soil and cli mate. Here grow and yield abundantly \"plants good for food\" and suited for needed manufactures. A comparison of the production of cereals with the products of other countries presents Virgiuia in a most favorable light, while nearness to market gives a most decided advantage. The climate and soil of Virginia favor the growth of nearly all the useful and profitable productions of the world. Wheat, corn, rye, buckwheat and Indian corn are raised in abundance. It is the native home of tobacco, and from it planters, manufacturers and the general government realize large sums of money. Cotton is grown in the southern section, and in all parts of the State cultivated grasses are successfully grown, and in some parts of the State the native grasses make the best grazing. Commodore Maury (good authority) says: \" Everything which can be cultivated in France, Ger many, or England, may be grown here equally as well, with other things besides, such as Indian corn, cotton, tobacco, peanuts, broom corn, and sweet potatoes, etc., which are not known as staples there. The climate and soil of Virginia are as favorable to the cultivation of the grape and the manufacture of wine, as they are in France and Germany. Tobacco is a staple product of Virginia. \"The Virginia Leaf\" is known the world over for its excellence \u2014 the result of manipulation as well as soil and climate. Piedmont and Middle Virginia lands are best for the growth of good tobacco ; those of Middle Virginia produce the finest tobacco and most valuable ; Tidewater is the region of Cuba and Latakia varieties, while immense crops of coarse, heavy tobacco are raised in the upper Counties on the rich lands of the Blue Ridge, the Valley, and Appa lachia. Virginia tobacco cannot be substituted either by new methods, new varieties, or adulteration ; it will always, in a series of years, maintain"], [477, "PHILIP W. McKINNEY. 439 its position of superiority in foreign markets. Whenever all restrictions and burdens are removed from tobacco, Virginia's brights, her sweet-fillers, and her rich shipping will assert their natural superiority and receive again the chief place in the market. Fisheries. The crab fisheries still continue a fruitful source of revenue to the people in a limited area of the Chesapeake. The earnings from this source, reckoned on the basis of men employed and capital invested, exceed slightly that derived from oysters, and the business seems to be growing larger and larger every year. Black bass, silver, white, and sun perch, southern, white, and horned chub, mullet, carp, pike, suckers, flat-back gar, mason, and whitesides, and eels can be found of good size in the rivers. Tidewater, independent of the great herring, shad, and menhaden fisheries (where 100,000 are caught at a haul), has a fine list of table fish caught and shipped to market the same day \u2014 sturgeon, rock, sheepshead, hogfish, trout, mullet, spots, bass, chub, Spanish mackerel, bluefish, croker, halibut, and others. The fish, like the fruit of Virginia, has the advantage of an earlier opening than the North has for marketing. Oysters are found in all the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay and along the Atlantic coast, giving to Tidewater an exclusive territory, where this valuable shell-fish grows naturally, and where it can be propagated and reared in almost any desired quantity. Major Hotchkiss, in his work on Virginia, says that it is estimated that more than 15,000,000 bushels are taken annually from the beds of Tidewater Virginia, valued at from $12,000,000 to $15,000,000. In 1869 over 5,000 small boats and 1,000 vessels, of over five tons burthen, were employed in taking oysters from the water, and 193 State and 309 other vessels, 18,876 tons aggregate burthen, were engaged in carrying them to market. For some years the supply has been growing less and the demand greater. Under the present system of depletion, the supply will soon be inadequate to the demand, and the prices will be higher. The person who has a well-stocked oyster shore can command ready sale, at good prices. There is no reason why the artificial propagation of oysters should not be conducted on a larger scale. In France there are oyster farms that pay an annual profit of $500 or $600 per acre. Virginia's Lynnhaven and Chesapeake stand at the head of the list for market, while others claim equal excellence.

NOTE A. On a bust in the Capitol at Rome is this inscription : \" Christoforo Colombo, Nato MCCCCXLII.\u2014 Morto MDVI.\" Christopher Columbus was the eldest son of Domenico Colombo, a wool comber, and Susanna Fontanarossa Colombo, and was born in Genoa, Italy, 1442. He early evinced an inclination for the sea, and his education was mainly directed to fit him for maritime pursuits. Besides ordinary branches, he studied Latin and Drawing, and for a time devoted himself to Geometry, Geography, Astronomy and Navigation, at the Uni versity of Pavia. When about fourteen years old he began his nautical career, and spent many years at sea, but of his experiences at this period history is silent. About 1470 he went to Lisbon, and supported himself by making maps and charts. Here he married Dofla Felipa, daughter of Bartolomrneo Mofiis de Perestrello, an Italian Cavalier and distinguished Navigator, who had colonized and governed the Island of Porto Santo. On this island Columbus now resided, where his wife had inherited some property, and here his son Diego was born. At this time Columbus devoted his life to study, and the papers, charts and journals which had been left by his father-in-law, were his daily companions. He also was brought into constant contact with persons interested iu maritime discov ery, and upon the Island of Porto Santo, he determined upon sailing West, hoping to reach India by a new passage. We will pass over his long period of discipline in waiting, until we see him under the auspices of Spain setting sail from the roads of Saltez, near Palos, on Friday morning, August 3, 1492, in the Santa Maria, carrying with him also the Pinta and the Nina. On Friday, October 12, 1492, the New World was discovered. Columbus made three voyages to the New World, and on the last went to Hispaniola to recruit his enfeebled health. His great distinction had excited the jealousy of many enemies, and his pathway ever since \"The Discovery\" had been strewn with thorns. Now, at Hispaniola, in his efforts to re-organize the unsettled Colony which he had previously planted, he was actively misrepresented by envy and malice. A commissioner sent by Spain to inquire into the difficulties, put 111"], [480, "APPENDIX. 442 1 Columbus in chains and sent him to his sovereign a manacled, insulted invalid. \"Are you taking me to death?\" inquired Columbus, when they led him from his cell to put him on the ship which was to carry him to Spain ; saying further : \"If twelve years' hardship and fatigue; if continued dangers and frequent famine ; if the ocean first opened, and five times passed and repassed to add a New World abounding iwith wealth to the Spanish monarchy ; and if an infirm and premature old age brought on by those services, deserve these chains as a reward, it is very fit I should wear them to Spain and keep them by me as memorials to the end of my life.\" \"I always saw those irons in his room,\" says his son Ferdinand, \" which he ordered to be buried with his body.\" Columbus is described as of good figure, of tall, commanding stature ; of a long visage and majestic aspect. He was greatly skilled in Navigation, was a man of undaunted courage and fond of hazardous undertakings. A distinguished Spanish historian says that \"if in ancient times he had per formed such an enterprise as the discovery of a New World, not only would temples and statues have been erected iu his honor, but some star would have been dedicated to him as there was to Hercules.\" Exhausted by age, fatigues and disappointnrents, Columbus died at Valladolid in the sixty-fifth year of his age, on Ascension Day, May 20th, 1506, saying with his last breath, \" Lord, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.\" His corpse was removed to Seville and buried in the Cathedral of that city with great funeral pomp, and by order of King Ferdinand, \" whose jealousy his death had extinguished,\" he was honored with a mar ble monument upon which was engraven the following : \"A Castilla Y A Leon Nuevo Mondo Dio Colon.\" 'To Castille and to Leon Columbus gave a New World.\" But, death did not end the voyages of the great Navigator. It is said that he had requested to have his remains taken to Santo Domingo, and accordingly in 1536, they were deposited in the Cathedral of that island ; thence they were conveyed with great ceremony in 1796 to the Cathedral of Havana, where they now repose. NOTE B. In the early part of the 15th century of our Lord, Venice was at the climax of her power. For long years she had been the centre of trade between Asia and Europe, and by conquest, by voluntary submission and by cession, the fairest portions of the Eastern Empire were under her sway. Most of the carrying trade of the world was in her hands. So with pride, no doubt, Cabot now unfurled the flag of this Republic,"], [481, "APPENDIX. 443 looking back to the wealth, population and greatness of his adopted home ; and remembering in this forest-clad realm of Nature the magnificent palaces and noble works of Art which enriched the superb City of Venice, with prophetic arm he raised the Republican banner of St. Mark beside the royal standard of St. George.
