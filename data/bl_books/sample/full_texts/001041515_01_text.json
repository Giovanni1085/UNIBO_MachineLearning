CHAPTER I, PARIS : A GENERAL GLANCE PARIS,\" said Heinrich Heine, \"is not simply the capital of France, but of the whole civilised worl 1, and the rendezvous of its most brilliant intellects.\" The art and literature of Europe were at that time represented in Paris by such men as Ary Scheffer, the Dutch painter, ni, the Italian composer, the cosmopolitan i beer, and Heine himself. Towards the of the eighteenth century most of the European Courts, with those of Catherine II. and Frederick the Great prominent among them, were regularly supplied with letters on Parisian bv Grimm, Diderot, and other writers ol the first distinction, who, in their moments, contributed articles to the Ency- \\t a much remoter period Paris was already one of the most famous literary capitals of Europe ; nor was it renowned for its literature Its art, pictorial anil sculptural, was also celebrated, and still more so its art m.:: while of recent years the country of nod, of Bizet, Massi m I and Saint- leading part in the world of music. Paris, too, has from the earliest times been a centre of science and philosophy. Here 1 Abelard lectured, and here the first hospitals were established. Then, again, Paris has ;: military history of singular interest and variety. It has been oftener turn within its walls by civic conflicts, and attacked hum without by the invader, than any other European city; while none has undergone so many regular sieg the capital of the country us which Frederick the (jreat used to say that, if he ruled it, nut a shut should be fired in Europe without his permission. Paris is at once the most ancient and tlie most modern capital in Europe. Great are the changes it has undergone since it first took form, eighteen centuries ago, as a fortress or walled town on an island in the middle ot the Seine; and at every period of its history we find some chronicler dwelling on the disappearance of ancient landmarks. Whole quarters are known to have been pulled down and rebuilt under cond Empire. But ever since the Revo lution of 1789, under each successive form of uncut and in almost every district, strag gling lanes have been giving way gradually to wide streets ami stately boulevards, and suburb uburb has been merged into the great city."], [16, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW. ; General Gl.ince., The Chaussee d'Antin was at the end of the last century a chaussee in fact as well as in name: a mere high-road, that is to say; and there were people living under the government of Louis-Philippe who claimed to have shot rabbits on the now densely populated Boulevard .Montmartre. The greatest changes, however, in the general physiognomy of Paris date from the Revolution, when, in the first place, as if by way of symbol, the hated fortress was demolished in which so many victims of despotism had languished. \"Athens,\" savs Victor Hugo, \"built the Parthe non, but Paris destroyed the Bastille.\" In the days when the great State prison was still stand ing, the broad, well-built Rue Saint-Antoine, in its immediate neighbourhood, used to be pi linted t< i bv antiquarians as covering the gn mnd where King Henry II. was mortally wounded m a tournament by Montgomery, an officer in the Scottish Guard. It was there, to,,, that, after the death of their protector, the \"minions\" ol Henry II. slaughtered one another. 'she now thickly inhabited Place des Victoires, where stands the statue ot Louis XIV., lasting monument of kingly pride and popular adulation, was at one time the most dangerous part of the capital. In the open space now enclosed by lordly mansions and commodious warehou thieves and murderers held their nightly as semblies, or even in th\" face of day committed depredations on the p* '\u25a0''. \"Could abetter site have been chosen historian of the last century, \"for the c^'gv of that royal robber, born for the ruin of his subjects and the dis turbance of Europe: who aimed at universal monarchy and sacrificed the wealth and happi ness of a whole kingdom Lo pursue an empty shadow ; who lived a tyrant and died an idiot ? \" Not far distant, the Halles, or general markets, stand on the spot where Charles V. made a famous speech against Charles, surnamed the Mischievous, King of Navarre; when the former was hissed and hooted by the mob because he had neither the good looks, the eloquence, nor the reasoning power of his antagonist. It was here, too, that the first dramas were acted in France ; and here, significantly enough, that .Moliere was born. At the Butte Saint-Roch, now remembered chiefly by the church of the same name, the Maid of Orleans was wounded during the siege of Paris, then in the hands of the English. Joan of Arc w.t- not at this time \u2014 not, at least, with the Parisians \u2014 the popular heroine she has since become. Detesting Charles VII. and all his supporters, they could not love the inspired girl whose example bad re-tore, 1 the courage of the king's troops. A Parisian of that day, who had witnessed tlie siege, describes her as a \" fiend in woman's guise.\" The bell may still be heard of Saint-Gcrmain l'Auxerrois ; the very bell, it is asserted, that called tlie faithful to the massacre of St. Bartholomew. Near the church from which the tragic signal rang forth stands the palace from whose windows Charles IX. fired upon the unhappy Huguenots as they sought safety by swimming across the Seine ; and close at hand used to be pointed out another window from which money was thrown to an agitated crowd in order to keep it from attending Moliere's funeral, at which the mob proposed, not to honour the remains of the illustrious dramatist, but to insult them. It was in the old Rue du Temple that the Duke of Burgundy fell by the hand of his assassin, the Duke of Orleans, only brother of Charles VI., who, though a madman and an idiot, was suffered to remain on the throne ; ami it was in this same Rue du Temple that Louis XVI. and Marie-Antoinette were confined before being taken to the guillotine. What scenes has not the Place de Greve witnessed! from the burning of witches to the torture of Damiens, and from the atrocious cruelties inflicted upon this would-be regicide to the first executions under the Revolution, when the cry of \"A la lanteme!\" ( to the lamp-post, that is to say, of the Place de Greve) was so frequently heard. But the most revolutionary spot in this, the most revolutionary capital in the world, is to be found in the gardens of the Palais Royal ; those' gardens from whose trees Camille Des moulins plucked the leaves wiiich the besiegers of the Bastille were to have worn in their hats as rallying signals. Here, too, assembled the journeymen printers, who, their newspapers having been suppressed by Charles X., deter mined, under tlie guidance of the journalists \u2014 their natural leaders on such an occasion \u2014 to reply by force to the armed censorship of the Government. Again, in [848, the Palais Royal Gardens witnessed the first manifestations ot discontent, though it was a pistol-shot fired on a fashionable part of the boulevard that precipi tated the collision between the insurgents and the troops. The next morning, at breakfast, Louis-Philippe was told that he had better abdicate ; and an hour afterwards an old gentle-"], [17, "General Glance.] THK PARIS OF THE ROMANS. 3 man. with a portfolio under his arm, was seen to take a cab on the Place de la G mci irde, and drive off in the direction of Saint-Cloud, whence he reached the coast of Normandy, and in due time the -hor. s of England. punished much on the principle laid down in the inscription of the sixth century which adorned one of the walls of Lutetia, the Paris of the Romans : \" If a thief is caught in the act he must, in the case of a noble, be brought to trial ; in the case of a peasant, be hanged on the spot.\" The capitular of Charlemagne forbade ecclesiastics to take human life : which did not prevent the abbes of different monas teries from besieging one another or crossing swords when, with their followers, they chanced to meet outside the fortified monasterial walls, whether in the plain or in the public street. The right of private warfare existed in France until 1235. Paris possesses one of the most ancient and one of the most characteristicallv modern churches in Europe \u2014 the venerable Notre-Dame, and in. contrast, the fashionable Madeleine, cele brated tor the splendour of its essentially mun dane architecture, the luxurious attire of its female frequenters, the beauty of its music, and the eloquence of its preachers. The first stone of Notre-Dame was laid, as Victor Hugo puts it, by Tiberius, who, recognising the site ofthe future cathedral as well-fitted for a temple, began by erecting an altar \"to the god Cerennos and to tin- bull Esus.\" In like manner, on the hill of Sainte-Genevieve, where now stands the edifice known as the Pantheon, Mercury was at one time- worshipped. Paris has undergone atrocious sufferings through war, famine, pestilence, and calamities of all kinds. The Normans, titter burning one half of Paris, allowed the remainder to be ran somed with an enormous sum of money. In one of the famines bv which Paris in its early davs was- so often visited, people cast lots as to which should be eaten. The taxes were so excessive that many pretended to be lepers, in order to profit bv the exemption accorded in such cases. But it was sometimes not well to be a leper, real or pretended ; for it was proclaimed one dav to the sound of horn and trumpet that lepers throughout the kingdom should be ex terminated : \" in consequence of a mixture oi herbs and human blood, with which, rolling it up in a linen cloth and tying it to a stone, they poison the wells and rivers.\" So rich is Paris in historical associations that often the same street, the same spot, recalls two widely different events. Thus the statue of 11. mi [V. on the Pont-Neuf commemorates the glory of the best and greatest of the French king-, an 1 at the same time marks the very ground where, in the fourteenth century, Jacques de- Molav, the Templar, was infamously burned. At No. 14 in the Rue de Bethisy Admiral Coligny died and Sophie Arnotild was born. At a house in the Rue des Marais Racine wrote \" Baj izet \" and \" Britannicus \" in the room where, fifty years later, the Duchess de Bouillon is said to have poisoned Adrienne Lecouvreur. There was a time when, at the corner ofthe Rue du Marche des Innocents, a marble slab, inscribed with letters of gold, associated the important year of [685 with three notable events : the arrival of tin embassy from Siam, a visit from the Doge of 1. and the revocation of the Kdict of Nantes. This strange record has disappeared, her with many other interesting memorials of various shapes and kinds: such, for example, ,1- th. iron cauldron in the Cour des Miracles, where, in the name of a whole series of kings who had played tricks with the national currency, and more than once produced national bank ruptcy, coiners used to be boiled alive. How terrible, and often how ridiculous, were the proclamations issued in those days ! In front of the Grand-Chatelet six heralds of France, clothed in white velvet, and rod in hand, were wont to announce after a plague, a war, or a famine that there was nothing more to be feared, and that the king would be graciously pleased to receive taxes as before. In the centre of the so-called \"town\" \u2014 Paris in general, that is to say, as distinct from the city \u2014 was \"la Maubuee \" (derived, according to Victor Hugo, from rttauvaise tuincc), where Jews innumerable were roasted over fires of pitch and green wood to punish what a chronicler of the time terms their \" anthropomancy \" ; and what the Counsellor de l'Ancre further describes as \"the marvellous cruelty they have always shown towards Chris tians, their mode of life, their synagogue, so displeasing to God, their uncleanliness, and their stench.\" The unhappy Jew-, however, were not the only victims.

It must be remem- bered, too, that under the reign of Louis XIV. Gothic architecture was proscribed, as recalling \" the age of barbarism.\" Every new edifice was constructed in the Italian or Italo-Byzantine style.

LUTETIA, the ancient Paris, or Lutetia Parisio- __j rum, as it was called by the Romans, stood in the midst of marshes. she name, derived, -lively enough, from liituin, the Latin for mud, has been invested with a peculiar signifi cance by those stern moralists who see in Paris nothing but a sink of iniquity. Balzac called it a \" wen \" ; and Blucher, when some ferocious member of his staff suggested the destruction of Paris, exclaimed : \" Leave it alone ; Paris will destroy all France!\" By a critic of less severe temperament Paris has been contemptuously described as \" the tavern of Europe \" \u2014 lc cabaret dc V Europe. Lutetia, however, can afford to smile alike at the slurs of moralists and the sneers ot cynics; and the etymology of her name need by no means alarm those ot her admirers who will reflect that lilies may spring from mud, and that the richest com is produced from the blackest soil. she development ot the Lutetia of C\u00e6sar's time into the Paris of our own has occupied main' eventful centuries ; and the centre of the development may still be seen in that little island of the so-called City \u2014 Flic dc la Cite once known as the Island of Lutetia. As to the dimensions of the ancient Lutetia, neither historian- nor geographers are wholly agreed. The t;erm of Paris is, in any case, to be found in that part of the French capital which has long been known as hi Cite, and which is the dullest and sleepiest part of Paris, just a in versely our \"city,\" distinctively so called, is the most active and energetic part of London. '['hu Parisians have always been given to insurrection; and their first rising was made against a ruler who was likely enough to put it down Julius Cesar, that is to say. Finding hi power defied, C\u00e6sar sent against the Parisians a body of troops, under the command of Labienus, who crushed the rebels in the first battle. His torians give different versions of the engagement, but modern writers are content tor the most part to rely on a tradition related by an author of tin. fourteenth century, Raoul de Presles, who published a French version of C\u00e6sar's account of the Battle of Paris, enriched by notes and comments from his own pen. Labienus, ac cording to Cesar and Raoul de Presles, was arrested in his first attack by an impassable marsh. Then, simulating a retreat along the left bank of the Seine, he was pursued by the Cauls, in spite of Camulogenes, their cautious leader; who, unable to restrain them, fell with them tit last into an ambuscade, in which chief and followers all perished. Raoul de Presles gives some interesting details about the marsh which Labienus, on making his advance against Paris, was unable to cross. Some identify it with the Marshes of the Temple, which formed, on the north of Paris, a continuous semicircle ; but Raoul de Presles seems to hold that the marsh which stopped the advance of Labienus protected Lutetia itself: that Lutetia of the Island which sprang from the mud as Venus sprang from the sea. The city of Lutetia was at that time so strong, so entirely shut in by water, that Julius C\u00e6sar himself speaks of the difficulty of reaching it. \"But since then,\" says Raoul de Presles, \" there has been much solidifi cation through gravel, sand, and all kinds of rubbish being cast into it.\" After the victory of Labienus, Lutetia, which the conqueror had destroyed, was quickly re-built ; and it was then governed as a Roman town. This, however, was in C\u00e6sar's time ; and the first description ot Lutetia as a city was given by Strabo some fifty years later. Jims it may safely be said that of the original Lutetia nothing what ever is known. It is certain, nevertheless, that in the new Lutetia, built by the Romans, the most important edifices stood at the western end of the island, including a palace, on whose ite was after wards to be erected the Palace of the French Kings ; while at the eastern end the most striking object was a Temple to Jupiter, in due time to be replaced by the Cathedral of Notre- Dame. As early as the fourth century Lutetia sound favour in the eyes of illustrious visitors ; and the Emperor Julian, known as the \"Apostate,\" when, after defeating seven German king Strasburg, he retired to Lutetia tor winter"], [21, "LUTETIA The Expansion of J 7 quarters, spoke of it, then and forever afterwards, as his \u2022\u25a0 dear Lutetia.\" des- Pre s, and Saint-Denis, near Paris \u2014 were saved, through the payment ofa heavy ransom. Sixteen years Utter, after a sufficient interval to allow ofa reconstruction, the Normans again returned, when once more the unhappy city was plundered and burnt. For twenty successive years Paris was the constant prey of the Norman pirates who held beneath their power the whole course of the Seine. \"Lutetia l\u00e6titia ! \" \u2014 Paris is my joy! \u2014 he might, with a certain modern writer, have ex claimed. Julian is not the only man who, going to Paris for a few months, has stayed there several years ; an 1 Julian's winter quarters of the year 355 so much pleased him that he remained in them until 300.

At last, however, a powerful fleet, led by 2 chief whom the French call \" Siegfroi,\" but whose real name was doubtless \"Siegfried,\" sustained a crushing defeat ; and, simultaneously with the Norman invaders, the Carlovingian Dynast)' passed away. From this date Paris ceased practically to form part ofthe Roman Empire. With the advent of the Capet Dynasty a con tinuous history began for Paris \u2014 in due time to become the capital of all France. Ancient Paris was three times burnt to the ground : the Paris which dates from the ninth century has often been conquered, but never burnt. More than a century before (in 245) St. Denis had undergone martyrdom on the banks of the Seine, walking about after decapitation with his head under his arm. This strange tradition had idy its origin in a picture by some simple minded painter, who had represented St. Denis carrying his own head like a parcel, because he could think of no more ingenious way of indicating the fate that had befallen the first apostle of Christianity in Gaul; just as St. Bartholomew has often been painted with his skin hanging - his arm like a loose overcoat. Ancient Paris, the Lutetia of the Romans, was an island enclosed between two branches of the Seine. But the river overflowed north and south, and it became necessary to construct large ditches or moats, which at once widened the boundaries of the \"city.\" Gradually the popu lation spread out in every direction ; and when, under Louis XIV., the line of boulevards was traced, the extreme limits of the capital were marked by this new enclosure. Then under Louis XVI., the Farmers-General, levying dues (the so-called octroi) on imports into the town, established for their own convenience certain \" barriers,\" at which persons bringing in food or drink were stopped until they had acquitted themselves of the appointed tax ; and, connecting these \" barriers,\" they thus formed the line of outer boulevards. After the defeat and death of Gratian, the government of Lutetia passed into the hai her bishops, who often defended the city against the incursions ofthe barbarians. In 470 Lutetia was besieged by the Franks, when Childeric gained possession of it, and de stroyed for ever all traces of the- Roman power. It now became a Frank or French town ; and, \" Lutetia Parisiorum \" being too long a name for the unlettered Goths, was shortened by them fust into \" Parisius,\" and ultimately, by the sup pression ofthe two last syllables, into \"Paris.\" Paris extended in time even to these outer boulevards. Then, under Louis-Philippe, at the instigation of his Minister, M. Thiers, a line of fortifications was constructed around Paris ; which, proving insufficient in 1N70 and 1 87 1 to save the capital fr< mi bombardment, has in its turn been surrounded bv a circle of outlying detached forts intercommunicating with one another. In the ninth century Paris underwent the usual Norman invasion, by which so many European countries, from Russia to England, and from England to Sicily\u2014 not to speak of the Norman or Varangian Guard of Constantinople \u2014 were sooner or later to be visited. The \" hardy men \" \u2014 or Norman pirates, as the unhappy Parisians doubt! ss called them \u2014 started from the island of Oissel, near Rouen, where they had established themselves in force ; and, moving with a numerous fleet towards Paris, laid siege to it, and, on its surrender, first pillaged it and then burnt it to the ground.

Paris had been invaded and occupied in 1814, and again in 1815.

To pass from the houses to their inhabitants, the population of Paris is as remarkable for variety as that of London tor uniformity of costume. For in Paris almost every class has its own distinctive dress. In England, and especially in London, the employer and his workmen, the millionaire and the crossing-sweeper, wear coats of the same pattern. In London, again, every work-girl, every market-woman, wears a bonnet imitated more or less perfectly from those worn by ladies of fashion. The history of Paris is the history of France itself. The decisive battles which brought the great civil and religious wars of the counts. end were fought outside or in the Very streets ot Paris. It was in Paris that the massacre of St. Bar tholomew \u2014 darkest blot on the French annals\u2014 was perpetrated.

The French workman wears a blouse and a cap, anil looks upon the hat as a sign, if not of superiority, at least of pretension. On the other hand, there is scarcely on the left bank one good hotel : certainly not one that could put forward the slightest pretension to being fashionable-. Nor, except in the case of professional men connected with the hospitals or the schools, would anyone mixing in fashionable society care to give his address anywhere on the left bank. \" Car moi j'ai pave ma casquette, Lt loi, tu n'as pas paye ton chapeau !' was the burden of a song very popular with the working classes during the revolutionary days ot I848 to ISC I. Jules Janin, one of the most distinguished writers of his time, and one of the most popular men in the great world of Paris from the reign of Louis Philippe until that of Napoleon III., did, it is true, live for years in a house close to the Luxemburg Gardens. But Janin possessed a certain originality, and thought more of what suited himself than of what pleased others. On one occasion, having engaged to tight a duel, he failed to put in an appearance by reason of the inclemency ofthe weather and his disinclination to get out of bed at the early hour for which the meeting had been fixed. Such a man would not be ashamed to live on the left bank if he happened to have found a place there which harmonised with his tastes. Owing to the varieties of dress already touched upon, a crowd in Paris presents a less gloomy, less monotonous appearance than the black coated mobs of I. .indon; and in harmony with the greater relief afforded by the different colours ofthe costumes are the animated gestures of the pels, nis composing the crowd. Observe, in deed, a mere group of persons conversing on no matter what commonplace subject, or idly chatting as they sip their coffee together on the boulevards, and they appear to be engaged in some- violent dispute. To mention vet another point on which Paris differs from London : the most interesting part of Paris lies on the right bank ofthe Seine, whereas all that is interesting in London lies on the left bank of the Thames. Apart, however, from all question of inclina tion and fashion, it is really inconvenient to anyone who mingles in Parisian life to live on the left bank ot the Seine, remote as it is from the boulevards, the Champs Elysees, the best hotels, the best restaurants, the best cafes, and the best theatres. The left bank of the Seine possesses, how ever, buildings and streets of historical interest. Here, too, is the quarter of the schools: the Ouartier Latin, as it is still called, not by reason of its Roman antiquities, which, except at the Hotel Cluny, would be- sought for in vain, but because, in the medi\u00e6val period whence the schools for the most part date, even to compara tively modern times, Latin was the language- of the student. On the \"left bank,\" moreover, stand the Institute, the Pantheon or Church of Ste. Genevieve, as, according to the predo minance of religion or irreligion, it is alter nately called ; the Ste.

Many of the great painters, too, have their studios \u2014 often little academies in them selves \u2014 on the left bank of the river ; while At the same time, no sort of comparison can be established between the transpontine districts of Paris and those of London. In London, no one who is anyone would dream of living \"on the other side of the water,\" where neither picture galleries, nor public gardens, nor artists' studios, nor famous streets, nor great houses of business, nor even magnificent shops are to be met with. Even Jules Janin, had he been an Englishman, would have declined to live in the region of Blackfriars or the Waterloo Road.

Journeying towards Paris, the king had been surprised by the darkness of night, and had supped and slept at Creteil, on the invitation of the inhabitants. The village, inhabitants and all, belonged to the Chapter of Notre Dame ; and the canons were much irritated at the king's having presumed to accept hospitality indirectly at their cost. When, next day, Louis, arriving at Paris, went, after his custom, to the cathedral in order to render thanks for his safe journey, he was astonished to find the .nates of Notre Dam- closed. He asked for an explanation, whereupon the canons THERE is no monument of ancient Paris so interesting, by its architecture and its historical associations, as the Cathedral of Notre Dame ; which, standing on the site of a Temple to Jupiter, carries us back to the time of the Roman domination and of Julius C\u00e6sar.

At this terrible announcement the king groaned, sighed, wept, and b orgive ness, humbly protesting that but for the gloom ot night and the spontaneous hospitality of the inhabitants \u2014 so courteous that a refusal on his part would have been most uncivil -he would never have touched that fatal supper. In vain did the bishop intercede on his behalf, offering to guarantee to the canons the execution of any promise which the king might make in expiation of his crime ; it was not until the prelate placed in their hands a couple of silver candlesticks as a pledge of the monarch's sin cerity that they would open to him the cathedral doors ; and even then his Majesty had to pay the cost of his supper at Creteil, and by way of confession, to deposit on the altar of Notre Dame the now historical wand. Louis XL, more devout even than the devout Louis VII., was equally unable to inspire his clergy with confidence. Before the dis covery of printing, in iq;i, manuscript books at Paris, as elsewhere, were so rare and 51 that students had much trouble iu procuring even those which were absolutely necessary for their instruction. Accordingly, when Louis XL wished to borrow from the Faculty ot Medicine the writings of Phases, an Arabian physician, he was required, before taking the book away, to deposit a considerable quantity of plate, besides the signature of a powerful nobleman, who bound himself to see that his Majesty restored the volume. Among the many legends told in connection with Xotre Dame is a peculiarly fantastic one, according to which the funeral service of a canon named Raimond Diocre, famed for his sanctity, was being celebrated by St. Bruno, when, at a point where the clergy chanted the words: Responde mihi quantas habes iniquitates? tin tlead man raised his head in the coffin, ami replied : Just'/ Dei indicia accusatus sum.

Once more there was a panic and general flight. The scene, with vet another variation, was repeated on the third dav, when the dead, who had already declared himself to have been \"accused\" and \"judged\" by Heaven, announced that he had been condemned: Justo Dei judicio condam natus sum. Witness of this terrible scene, St. Bruno renounced the world, did penance, be came a monk, and founded the Order of Les Chartreux. In the twelfth century Notre Dame was, it is true, known as the \" New Church.\" This appel lation, however, served only to distinguish it from the smaller Church ol St. Stephen 1 St. Etienne), which had been left in its original state, without addition or renovation. The plan of the cathedral has, like- that of other cathedrals, been changed from century tu century ; but in spite of innumerable modifi cations, the original plan asserts itself. From the fourteenth to the seventeenth century the Church of Notre Dame was left nearly untouched. Then, however, in obedience to the wishes ,,t Louis XIIL, it was subjected to a whole series ot pretended embellishments, for which \"muti lations \" would be a fitter word. In the eighteenth century, between the years 1 773 and 17.X7, damaging \"improvements,\" and \"restorations\" of the most destructive kind, were introduced; until at the time of the- Revolution the idea was entertained of depriving the venerable edifice alt. igether of its religious character. The outside statues were first threatened, but Chaumette saved them by dwelling upon their supposed astro nomical and mythological importance. He de clared before the Council of the Commune that the astronomer Dupuis (author of\" L'origine de tous les Cultes\") had founded his planetary system on the figures adorning one of the lateral doors of the church. In conformity with Chau mette's representations, the Commune spared all those images to which a symbolic significance might be attached, but pulled down and con demned the statues of the French kings which ornamented the gallery and the principal facade. The cathedral at the same time lost its name. Temple of Reason it was now, until the re establishment of public worship, to be called. Then new mutilations were constantly perpetrated, until at last, in 1 845, the work of restoring the cathedral was placed in competent hands, when, thanks to the learning, the labour, and the taste of MM. Lassus and Viollet-Leduc, Notre Dame was made what it still remains \u2014 one of the most magnificent specimens of medi\u00e6val architecture to be found in Europe. Why describe the ancient monument, when it is so much simpler tu represent through drawings and engravings it most characteristic features ? The incident has been depicted by Lesueur, who received a commission to record on canvas the principal events in the life of the saint.

But how and when the transformation took place is not known, though the period is marked more or less precisely by the date ot the introduction of Christianity into France. Little confidence, however, is to be placed in those authors who declare that the Paris cathedral was founded in the middle of the third century by St. . the first apostle of Christianity in France ; for at the very time when St. Denis was preaching the Gospel to the Parisians the severest edicts -till in force against Christians. It cannot, then, be supposed that the officials of the Roman Empire would have tolerated the erection of .1 Christian church. It can be shown, however, that under the episcopacy of Bishop Marcellus, about the year 375, there already existed a Christian church in the city of Paris, on the borders of the Seine and on the eastern point of the island, where a Roman temple had formerly stood. Towards the end of the sixth century the cathedral was composed of two edifices, close together, but quite distinct. One of these was dedicated to the Virgin, the other to St. Stephen the Martyr. Gradually, however, the Church ofour Lady was extended and developed until it touched and embraced the Church of St. Stephen. The Church of St. Mary, as many called it, was the admiration of its time. Its vaulted roofs were supported by columns of marble, and Venantius Fortunatus, Bishop of Poitiers, declares that this was the first church which received the rays of the sun through glass windows. More than once it is said to have been burnt during the incursions of the Normans. But this is a matter of mere tradition, and the destruction of the Cathedral by fire, whether it ever occurred or Some of the most interesting, most curious facts of its history may, however, be appropriately related. The Count of Toulouse, Raymond VII., accused of having supported the Albigciises"], [29, "THE PLACE DE GREVE.

These disputes often occurred when the represen tatives of foreign Powers wished to take a higher position than in the opinion ol their hosts was due to them. It must be noted, too, that at Notre Dame King Henry VI, of England, then ten years old, was crowned King of France. An attempt was made by a thief to steal from the altar of Notre- Dame its candlesticks. After concealing himself in the roof, the man, aided by other members of his band, let down ropes and, encircling the silver ornaments, drew them upwards to his hiding-place. In performing this exploit, however, he set fire to the hangings of the church, by which much damage was causi Under the- Regency the cathedral of Paris was the scene of one of the- most daring exploits per formed bv Cartouche's too audacious band. A number of the robbers had entered the church in the early morning, and had succeeded in climbing up and concealing- themselves behind the tapestry of the roof. Their pockets were filled with stones, and at a pre-concerted signal, just as the priest to read the first verse of the second Psalm in the service ot Vespers, they shouted in a loud voice, threw their missiles among the congre gation, and cried out that the roof was falling in. A frightful panic ensued, during which the confederates of the thieves overhead helped themselves to watches, purses, and whatever valuables they Could find on the persons of the terrified worshipp. I The interim- of Notre Dame has in different centuries been turned to the most diverse purposes. Here at one time, in view of Church I-, vendors of fruits and flowers held market. At other times religious mysteries, /en mundane plays, have been performed ; while in the thirteenth century the Paris cathedral was the recognised asylum of all who suffered in mind or body. A particular part of the buil ling was reserved for patients, who were attended by physicians in holy orders. It was provided by a special edict that this hospital within a church should be kept lighted at night by ten lamps. All attempts, however, to keep order were in vain; and in consequence ol the noise made by the invalids while religious service was going on, they were, one and all, excluded from the cathedral. It was at Notre Dame, on the 10th of November, [793, that the Feast of Reason was celebrated, the Goddess of Reason being impersonated by a well-known actress, the- beautiful Mile. Maillard. The space in front of Notre Dame was at one time the scene of as many executions as the Place de Greve, which afterwards became and for some centuries remained the recognised execution ground ofthe French capital. During the troubles caused by the captivity of King John the citizens of Paris made a vow to tr to Our Lady a wax candle as long as the boundary-line of the city. Every year the municipal body carried the winding taper, with much pomp, to the Church of Notre Dame, where it was received by the bishop and the canons in solemn assembly. The pious vow was kept for five hundred and fifty years, but ceased to be fulfilled at the time ot the religious wars and of the League. In 1603 Paris had gained such dimensions that the ancient vow could -. be renewed, and in place of it, Francois Miron, lebrated Provost of the Merchants, offered a silver lamp, made in the form of a ship (prin- cipal object in the arms of Paris), which he 1 himself to keep burning night and day. In Notre Dame, too, were suspended the prin cipal flag- taken from the enemy, though it was only during- war time that they were thus exhibited. When peace returned, the flags were put carefully \"Ut of sight.

In 1587, under the reign of Henry IV., Dominique Miraille, an Italian, and a lady of Etampes, his mother-in-law, were condemned to be hanged and afterwards burnt in front of liame for the crime of magic.

Magic was employed not only for self-preservation, but with the most murderous intentions. When it was used to destroy an enemy, his effigy was prepared in wax ; and the thrusts and stabs inflicted upon the figure were supposed to be felt by the original. A gentleman named Lamalle, having been executed mt the- Place de Greve in 1574, and a wax image, made by the magician Cosmo Ruggieri, having been found upon him, Catherine de Medicis, who patronised this charlatan, feared that the wax figure might have been de signed against the life of Charles IX., and that Ruggieri would therefore be condemned to death. Lamalle had maintained that the figure was meant to represent the \"Great Princess\": Queen Marguerite, that is to say. But Cosmo Ruggieri was condemned, all the same, to the galleys; though his sentence \u2014 thanks, no doubt, tu the personal influence of Cathi de Medicis \u2014 was never executed. Nicholas Pasquier, who gives a long account of Ruggieri in his Public Letters, declares that he died \"a very wicked man, an atheist, and a great magician,\" adding that he made another wax figure, on which he poured all kinds of venoms poisons in order to bring about the death of \" our great Henry.\" HUE DU Cl.OilKE. But he was unable to attain his end ; and the king, \" in his clemency, forgave him.\" Medicis was one of the chief believers in all kinds of superstitious practices ; and a column used to be shown in the flower-market from which she observed at night the course of the stars.

After this he was to be carried on the sledge to the Place de Greve, where, on the scaffold, he was to undergo a variety of tortures, copied from those appointed for the punishment of Ravaillac. Finally, his goods were to be confiscated, the house where he was born pulled down, and his name stigmatised as infamous, and for ever forbidden thenceforth, under the severest penalties, to be borne by any French subject. Damiens had been educated far above his rank. His moral character, however, speedy death. It was in front of Notre Dame that by order of the princes, dukes, peers, and mar shals of France, assembled in the Grand Chamber of Parliament. Damieiis was con demned to do penance before being tortured and torn to pieces. He was to be tormented, by methods no matter how barbarous, until he revealed his accomplices, and was also re quired to make the amende honorable before the principal door of Notre Dame.

His life had been one per petual oscillation between debauchery and fanati cism. His changeableness of disposition was noticed during his imprisonment at Versailles. Sometimes med thoroughly composed, as though he had suffered nothing and had nothing to suffer ; at other times he burst into sudden and vehement passions, and attempted to kill himself against the walls of his dungeon or with the chains on his feet. As in one of his furious fits he had tried to bite off his tongue, his teeth were all drawn, in accordance with an official order. The torture of Damiens lasted many hours, and it was nut till midnight, when both his legs and one of his arms had been torn off, that his remaining arm was dragged from the socket. The life of the poor wretch could scarcely have lasted so long as did the execution ot the sentence passed upon him. A report of the trial was published by the Registrar of the Parliament ; but the original record being destroyed, it is impossible to test the authenticity of this report. It fills four small volumes, and is entitled \" Pieces Originates et Procedures du Proces fait a Robert Franrois Damiens, Paris, I 7 57-\" When the sentence was read to him, Damiens simply remarked, \" La joumee sera rude.\" Every kind of torture was applied to him to extort confessions. His guards remained at his side night and day, taking note of the cries and exclamations which escaped him in the midst of his sufferings. But Damiens had nothing to confess, and mi the 28th of January he was carried, with his flesh lacerated and charred by fire, his bones broken, to the place of execution. Ivan the Terrible, when his digestion was out of order, and he felt unequal to the effort of breakfasting, used t. -evive his jaded appetite by visiting the prisons and seeing criminals tor tured. George Selwyn claimed to have made amends for his want of feeling in attending to see Lord Lovat's head cut off by going to the undertaker's to see it sewn on again, when, in presence of tfle- decapitated corpse, he exclaimed with strange humour, and in imitation of the voice and manner of the Lord Chancellor at the trial: \u2014 \"My Lord Lovat, your lordship may rise.\" This dilettante in the sufferings of others is known to have paid a visit to Paris for the express purpose of seeing Damiens torn in pieces. < )n the day ofthe execution, according to Mr. Jesse (\"George Augustus Selwyn and his contempo raries\"), \" he mingled with the crowd in a plain undress and bob wig,\" when a French nobleman. ing th. deep interest he took in the scene, and supposing from the simplicity of his attire that he was a person of the humbler ranks in lite, i hose to imagine that the stranger must infallibly be an executioner. \"Eh, bien, monsieur,\" he said, \" ctcs-voiis arrive pour voir ce spectacle?\" \"Oui, monsieur.\" \" Vous etes bourreau?\" \"Non, noli, monsieur, je n'ai pas cet honneur ; je ne suis qu'un amateur.\" Immediately after his self-accusation in front of Notre Dame he was taken to the Place de Greve, where the hand which had held the knife was burnt with the flames of sulphur. Then he was torn with pincers in the arms and legs, the thighs and the breast, and into his wounds were poured ted hot lead and boiling oil, with pitch, wax, and sulphur melted and mixed. The sufferer endured these tortures with surprising energy. He cried out from time-to time, \"Lord, give me patience and strength.\" \"But he did not blaspheme,\" sacs Barbier, in his narrative of the scene, \" nor mention any names.\" The end of the hideous tragedy was the dis memberment. The four traditional horses were not enough. Two more were added, and still the i iperath in did m >t advance. Then the executioner, filled with horror, went to the neighbouring Hotel de Ville to ask permission to use \" the axe at the joints.\" He was, according to Barbier, sharply rebuked by the king's attendants, though in an account of the tragedy contributed at the time to the Gentleman's Magazine (and derived from the gazettes published in Holland, where there was no censorship), the executioner was blamed for having delayed the employment of the axe -ii long. Wraxall tells the story somewhat differently. \" Selwyn's nervous irritability,\" he says, \"and anxious curiosity to observe the effect of dissolu tion on men, exposed him to much ridicule, not unaccompanied with censure.

Soon after wards, music, history, and religion were once more to be intermingled. This was in August, 1702, when the last day of the French Monarchy I August 101 was tit hand. The most imposing- ceremony ever witi within the walls of Notre Dame was, as before said, the Coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte, tit the hands of the Pope, on Sunday, the 2nd December, 1804. The Holy Father set out with his retinue at ten o'clock in the morning, and much earlier than the Emperor, in order that the ecclesiastical and royal processions should not clash. He was accompanied by tt numerous body of clergy, gorgeously attired and resplendently ornamented, whilst his escort consisted of detachments ot the Imperial Guard. A richly decorated portico had been erected all around the Place Notre Dame to receive on their descent from the royal carriages the sovereigns and princes who were to proceed to the ancient basilica. Already, when the Pope entered the church, there were assembled within it the deputies of the towns, the representatives of the magistracy and the army, the sixty bishops, with their clergy, the Senate, the Legislative Body, the Council of State, the Princes of Nassau, Hesse, and Baden, the Arch-Chancellor of the Germanic Empire, and the ministers of the different European Powers. The great door of Notre Dame had been closed, because the back of the Imperial throne was placed against it. The church, therefore, was entered by the side doors, situated at the two extremities of the transept. When the Pope, preceded by the cross and by the insignia of his office, appeared, the whole assembly rose from their seats, and a body of five hundred instrumentalists and vocalists gave forth with sublime effect the sacred chant, Tu es /'e/r its. The Pope walked slowly towards the altar, before which he knelt, and then took his place on a throne that had been prepared for him to the right of the altar. The sixty prelates of the French Church pre sented themselves in succession to salute him, and the arrival of the Imperial family was now awaited.

The Emperor did not ar rive until considerably after the hour appointed, and the position of the Pope was a painful one during this long delay, which was due to the excessive precautions taken to prevent the two pro cessions from getting mixed. The Emperor set out from the Tuileries in a carriage which seemed entirely made invested with Imperial power. On reaching the portico, already spoken of, Napoleon alighted from his carriage and walked towards the cathedral.

Haying entered the church to the sound of solemn music, he knelt, and then passed on to the chair which he was to occupy before taking possession ut the throne. The ceremony then began.

Escorted by his marshals on horseback, he ad vanced slowly along the Rue St. Honore, the Quays of the Seine, and the Place Notre Dame, amidst the acclamations of immense crowds, delighted to see their favourite general at last up the crown.

The coronation of Napoleon has been made the subject of a masterpiece by David, whose work may be seen, and with interest studied, m the galleries of Versailles.

The whole of the Protestant party became filled with mistrust ; and observing this, Catherine de Medicis determined to strike her blow at once. It was difficult, of course, to raise troops without alarming the Huguenots. But it so chanced that an army sent by the King of Spain to the Low Countries was then inarching along the French frontiers. As if apprehensive tor the safety of her dominions, Catherine raised 6,000 Swiss troops, and after the Spaniards had towards their destination, marched them to the centre of the kingdom. Everything seemed t\" favour Catherine's designs. But someone having informed the Calvinists of the peril which threatened them, they assembled in the house nt the admiral at Chatillon, and there resolved to seize upon the Court, which was enjoying the fine weather at Monceau, in Brie, without the least precaution for its own safety ; as though it had nothing to fear from that body ot men whose destruction it notoriously meditated. The design of the Protestants was to drive away the Guises, and place the king and queen at the head of their own party. The attempt, however, failed through the firm attitude of the Swiss troops, who repulsed the attack of Andelot and La Rochefoucauld, and brought the king from Meaux to Paris surrounded by a strong battalion. ONE of the oldest and most interesting churches in Paris is that of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, which, dating from the last days of Lutetia. before the name of Parisius, or Paris, had been finally adopted for the gradually expanding city, is closely associated with the most terrible event in French history. Still, at the pre cut time, in a perfect state of preservation, it was built about the year 572 ; and just one thousand years after wards, in 1572, the signal for the massacre ot St. Bartholomew's Dav was sounded from its belfry. Philip II. , King of Spain, Pope Pius IV., and the Guises, especially Cardinal de Lorraine, were the authors of the massacre. Catherine de Medicis and her son Charles IX., King of France, were but accomplices and executants in the atrocious plot. Before speaking of the principal incidents of this ghastly day, a glance is necessary at the events which preceded it. Charles IX. and his Elizabeth, wife of Philip II., had brought her at Bayonne, in 1565, all the most dis tinguished members of the French Court. But the dominating figure of the assembly was the too famous Duke of Alva, worthy confidant and ad viser of Philip II. Catherine- de Medicis had fre quent conferences with the duke, and in spite ofthe \\ with which they were conducted, certain words reached the ear of the Prince of Beam, afterwards Henry IV., whose extreme youth disarmed all suspicion, but who perceived, never theless, that the object of these conversations was to determine the best method of destroying the Protestants in France. The young prince hastened to tell the Queen of Navarre, his mother, and she informed the Prince de Conde and Admiral de Coligny, chiefs ofthe Protestant party, who at once took counsel as to how the blow with which they were threatened could be averted. The war began again, and the Calvinists, commanded by the Prince de Conde, were de feated, the prince himself being slain, or rather assassinated, during the conflict. He had just surrendered to Dargence, when Montesquieu, captain of the Duke of Anjou's guard, on learning who he was, shot him in the head, exclaiming, \"Tue/ ! Tue/, Mordieu ! \" The Prince of Beam now became the chiet of the Protestant party, and as such, directed their forces at tbe Battle of Jarnac, with Coligny as second in command. The result of this en gagement was a temporary peace, by which certain privileges were granted to the Pro testants : not to be enjoyed, but simply to in spire a false consilience. It was not so easy to deceive Admiral Coligny, who, observing that the Guises had lost nothing of the influence they exercised over the king and queen, resolved to remain still upon hi- guard. At last, however, The next year, in 1566, the assembly at Moulins furnished an opportunity for bringing about a reconciliation between the Catholic house of Guise and the Protestant house of Chatillon. But so little sincerity was there in the compact of peace, that just after the assembly had broken up Coligny was apprised that a plot had been formed for his assassination.

Catherine spoke in a confiding tone to the old admiral about the war she pretended to contemplate against Flanders, and the king said to him, with a familiar slap on the shoulder : \" I have you now, and don't intend to let you go.\" Flattered bv these attentions, he felt secure, though many of his friends still doubted the sincerity of the king and queen. Their suspicions were confirmed by the sudden death of the Queen ol Navarre, which was attributed to i. Vainly, however, did they attempt to awaken the brave old admiral to his danger.

One of them, Langoiran by name, asked the admiral's per mission to quit his service. \"Why?\" said Coligny, in astonishment. \"Because,\" replied Langoiran, \"they are loading us with caresses, and I would rather fly like a dog than die like a dupe.\" Nothing, however, could disturb the con fidence ot the admiral, who returned to Paris only to throw himself into the arms of his assassins. the house from which the sho!- had proceeded (the arquebus was loaded with several bullets), and tried to get the assassin arrested ; but he had already fled. Then, leaning on his servants, he finished the journey to his own hou li n .t . The king was playing at tennis when the news of the infamous act was brought to him. \"Shall I never have any peace?\" he exclaimed, as he threw down his racquet. The admiral's friends resolved to complain at once to the king, and to demand justice. For this purpose Henry, King of Navarre, accompanied by the Prince de Conde, went to the palace, when Charles replied, with an oath, that he would inflict punishment. It was evident, he added, that a crime of this kind was a threat against the life of the king himself, and that no one would henceforth be safe if it were left unavenged. Idle king, profanely as he spoke, was sincere ; nor had the remotest thought of a massacre yet entered his head, The very day of the attack on Coligny he paid a visit of sympathy to the wounded admiral, accompanied by his mother, the Duke of Anjou, and a brilliant suite. He called him the bravest general in the kingdom, and assured him that his assailant should be terribly punished, and the edict in favour of Protestants in Fiance absolutely obeyed. The young King of Navarre, the future Henry IV., was about to be married to the sister of the King ot France, and the ceremony was to be made the occasion of all kinds of entertain ments and festivities. The enemies of the Protestants were meanwhile preparing their massacre ; and in the first place the death of Coligny was resolved upon. Hitherto the queen had not dared to breathe to the king a word of her murderous designs, fearing an explosion of indignation on his part ; and Charles's first bursts of passion were always terrible. But as they were returning to the Louvre from their visit to the admiral she suc ceeded in frightening her royal son by hinting tit the dark and foul projects which she attributed to the admiral. So enraged was the king that she could now fearlessly own to him that every thing had taken place by her orders and tl. the Dukes of Anjou and Guise. When Richard III., in Shakespeare's play, says to one of his pages, \" Know'st thou a murderer ? \" the ingenuous youth replies \u2014 \" I know a ruined gentleman Whose humble mean- match nut his haughty tastes.\" A gentleman of this sort (and it was precisely from such material during the Renaissance that murderers were formed) presented himself in La Brie, the favourite country of witchery and be (lev 1 1 ment. He was called Maurevel, and surnamed, for no i i, \" the King-slayer.\" Hired for the purpose, he concealed himself in a house m the Rue i mt Germain l'Auxerrois, whence, just as Coligny passed by, mi his way from the Louvre to dine at his house in Rue Bethizi, he sued at him with an arquebus, wounding him severely in the left arm tun! cutting off the forefinger of his left hand. With out showing much emotion, Coligny pointed to The too credulous Charles vowed that in face of such nefarious plots on the part , >f the Pn itestants, Coligny should die, and the Huguenots be put wholesale to the S word, SO that not one should survive to reproach him with the act. The massacre being thus decided upon, it now only remained to put the infamous project into execution. In a conference at the Tuileries between the king, the Duke of Anjou, the Duke ot Nevers, the Count ot Angouleme, illegitimate brother of the king, the keeper of the seals, Birague, Marshal de Tavanne and Count de- Ret/, the slaughter was fixed for Sunday, August 24th, 1-7:. the day of the Feast of St. Bartholo-"], [38, "] Auxerrois. -4 PARIS, OLD AND NEW. mew. There was a difference of opinion as to whether the King of Navarre, the Prince dc Conde, and the Montmorencys should be included in the massacre. Then Tavanne summoned Jean Charron, provost of the merchants, and in the king's presence ordered him to arm the Citizen Companies, and to march them at midnight to the Hotel de Ville for active service. these words Coligny, understanding that his life was as good as lost, got up, and leaning against the wall, was saving his prayers, when the assassins broke into his room. Besme advanced towards him. \"Are you Coligny?\" he asked, with the point of his sword at the old man's throat. \"I am,\" he replied with calmness ; \" but will you not respect my age ? \" Besme plunged his sword CHURCH OF ST.-GERMAIN-L'AUXERROIS The ferocious impatience of the Duke of Guise, who had undertaken the murder of Coligny, did not allow him to await the signal agreed upon for the massacre. He hurried, at two o'clock in the morning, to the house of the admiral, and ordered the gates to be opened in the name of the king. An officer, commanding the guard sta tic, tied in the court -yard to protect the admiral's person, turned traitor, and admitted the assassins with a deferential salute. Three colonels in the French army, Petrucci, Siennois, and Besme ; a German, a native of Picardy named Attin, Sarlaboux, and a few other gentlemen, rushed up the staircase, shouting, \"Death to him!\" At into the admiral's body, drew it out smoking, and then struck his victim several times in the face. The admiral fell, and Besme, hastening to the window, cried out to the Catholic noblemen who were waiting in the court-yard, \" It is done ! \" \"M. d'Angouleme will not believe it till he sees the corpse at his feet,\" replied the Duke of Guise. Sarlaboux and Besme seized the body and threw it into the court-yard. The Duke of Angouleme wiped the admiral's face with his handkerchief ; I rinse said, \"It is really he\" ; and both ot them, after kicking the body with ferocious delight, leaped on horseback, ami exclaimed) Courage, soldiers ! we have begun well ; let"], [39, "TOPOGRAPHY OF PARIS. 2 ; THE PRINCIPAL STKEKTS OK PARIS."], [40, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW. 26 lain-l'Auxerrois. us now see to the other-. By order of the King ! This crime had scarcely been consummated when the great bell of St.-Germain-1'Auxerrois gave the signal for the massacre, which became general. At the cries and shrieks raised round them, the Calvinists came out of their house-, halt-naked and without arms, to be slain by the troops of the Duke of Guise, who himsell ran along the streets, shouting \"To arms ! \" and inciting the people to massacre. The butchery was universal and indiscriminate, without dis tinction of age or sex. The air resounded with the yells of the assassins and the groans of their victims. When daylight broke upon the hideous picture, bodies bathed in gore were everywhere to be -ecu. Dead and dying were collected, and thrown promiscuously into the Seme. Within the precincts of the palace, the royal guards, drawn up in two lines, killed with battle-axes unhappy wretches who were brought to them unarmed and thrust beneath their very weapon-. Some tell without a murmur ; others protested with their last breath against the treachery of the king, who had -worn to defend them.

Marsillae, Count de la Rochefoucauld, one id\" the king's favourites, had passed a portion of the night with him, when Charles, who had some thought of saving In- life, advised him to sleep in the Louvre. But he at last let him go, and Marsillae w a- -tabbed as he went out. Antoine of Clermont Renel, running away in his shirt, was massacred by his cousin, Bussy d'Amboise. Count Teligni, who, ten months before, had married Admiral deColigny'sdaughti r, -ed such an agreeable countenance and such gentle manners that tbe first assassins who entered his housecould not make up their minds to strike him. But they were followed by others less scrupulous, who at once put the young man to death. An advocate named Taverny, assisted by one servant, resisted at his house a siege which lasted nine hour- ; though, after exhausting every means of defence, he was at last -lain. Several noblemen attached to the King of Navarre were assassinated in his abode. The prince himself and Conde, his cousin, were arrested, and threat ened with death. Charles IX., however, spared them on their abjuring Calvinism. A few days before the massacre Caumont de la Force had bought some horses ot a dealer, w ho, chancing to be in the immediate neighbourhood when Admiral de Coligny was assassinated, hastened to inform his customer, well known as one of the Protestant leaders, of what had taken place. This nobleman and his two sons lived in the Faubourg St. -Germain, which was not yet connected with the right bank by any bridge. The horse-dealer, therefore, swam across the Seine to warn La Force, who, however, had already effected his escape. But as his children were not following him, he returned to save them, and had scarcely set foot m his house when the assassins were upon him. Their leader, a man named .Martin, entered his room, disarmed both father and sons, and told them they must die. La Force offered the would-be murderers a ransom of 2,000 crowns, payable in two day.-. The chief accepted, and told La Force and his children to place in their hats paper crosses, and to turn back their right sleeves to the shoulder: such being the signs of immunity among the slaughterers. Thus prepared, Martin conveyed them to his house in the Rue des Petits Champs, and made La Force swear that neither he nor his children would leave the place until the 2,000 crowns were paid. For additional security, he placed some Swiss soldiers on guard, when one of them, touched with compassion, offered to let the prisoners escape. La Force, however, refused, preferring, he said, to die rather than fail in his word. An aunt of La Force's furnished him with the 2,000 crowns, and he was about to count them out to Martin, when a French nobleman came to inform La Force that the Duke of Anjou wished to speak to him. On this pretext the emissary conducted both father and sons from the house without their caps : with nothing, that is to say, to distinguish them from the victims ot assassination. They were at once set upon. La Force's eldest son fell, crying out \" Je suis mort.\" The father, pierced to the heart, uttered a similar exclamation ; on which the youngest La Force hail the presence of mind to throw himself to the ground as it dead. Supposed to be a corpse, he was gradually stripped of hi- clothes, until a man who intended to steal from him a pair of woollen stockings, of which he had not yet been divested, could not restrain, as he looked upon the boy's pallid face, some expression of sympathy. Seeing that the stranger had taken pity on him, voting I. a Force whispered that he was not dead. He wa- told to keep quiet ; and the man with . lor woollen stockings wrapped him up in his"], [41, "A ROYAL MARRIAGE.

The Parliament accepted this announcement with approval ; and despite the absence of all evidence against the admiral, it was decreed that his body should be dragged through the streets on tt hurdle, then exhibited in the Place de Greve, and ultimately hung by the heels on a gibbet at Montfaucon. His house was at the same- time to be destroyed, the trees in his garden cut down, and the members of his family reduced to the condition of plebeians, or roturicrs, and declared unable to hold any public office ; which, however, elid not prevent Coligny 's daughter from becoming soon afterwards the wife ot the Prince ot ( Mange. was governor. The most famous, or rather infamous, of those who took part in the massacre as leader- or principal agents were Jean Eerier, an advocate, and at that time captain of his quarter, Pey hi, a butcher, and Curce, a goldsmith, who, with upturned sleeves and bloody arms, boasted that 400 Huguenots had died beneath his blade. The massacre lasted in Paris with diminishing fury for a whole month. It was enacted, more over, in nearly all the large towns ; though in few the governors refused to execute the order.- transmitted to them. At Lyons 4,000 killed. Here the governor, Mandelot by 11 un., finding after several dav-' massacre that were still a number of Huguenots to slay, ordered the executioner to despatch them; on which that functionary replied that it was his duty to execute criminals convicted of violating the laws of State, but that he was not an assassin, and would not do assassins' work. This spirited reply lee. ill- Joseph de Maistre's celebrated paradox about the executioner and the soldier: the for mer putting to death only the worst offenders in virtue of a legal mandate, yet universally loathed ; the latter plunging his sword into the body of anyone he is told to slay, yet universally honoured, The explanation of the ingenious paradox is, after all, simple enough. The execu tioner kills in cold blood, without danger to himself; the soldier risks his life in the per formance of his duty. Not many years after the massacre of St. Bartholomew, the Church of St.-Germain-1'Au xerrois, in September, 1 581, was the starting-point ofa very different series of performance-. \"On Monday, September [8th,\" says the writer ol a contemporary account, \"the Due de Joyeuse (Henry III.'s favourite ' minion ') and Marguerite of Lorraine, daughter of Nicholas de Vaudemont, and sister of the queen, were betrothed in the Queen's Chamber, and the following Sunday were married at three- o'clock in the after noon at the parish church of Saint-Germain 1'Auxerrois. The king led the bride, followed by the queen, the princese-s, and other ladies in such superb attire that no one recollects to have seen anything like it in France so rich and so sumptuous. The dresses of the king and of the bridegroom were the same, and were so covered with embroidery, pearls, and precious stones, that it was impossible to estimate their value. Such an accoutrement had, for instance, cost ten thou sand crowns in the making ; and at the seventeen feast- which were now from day to day given by the king to the princes and lords related to the bride, and by other great persons of the Court, the guests appeared each time in some new costume, gorgeous with embroidery, gold, silver, and diamonds.

Nearly two centuries later, in 1744. the cele brated actress and singer, Sophie Arnottld, came into the world in the very room in which Admiral tie Coligny was assassinated. Sophie Afhould, ot whose operatic career mention is made elsewhere, was the only French actress of whom Garrick, in narrating his experiences of Parisian theatrical life, could speak with enthusiasm. As a singer she does not seem to have possessed much power, for she writes in the fragment of her \" Memoirs \" which has come down to us : \" Nature had seconded my taste tor music with a tolerably agreeable voice, weak but sonorous, though not extremely so. It was, however, sound and well balanced, so that, with a good enunciation, and without any noticeable effort, not a weird of what I sang was lost even 111 the most spacious buildings.\" With regard to her personal ap pearance, Sophie writes: \" My figure is slender and regular, though I must admit that I am not tall.

From time to time it has been partially repaired, but the lines on which it was originally constructed were never changed. Parisians have for the last three centuries regarded the Pont- Neuf as the type of solidity ; and a Parisian who does not aspire to originality in conversation will not hesitate, even to this day, when asked how he is, to reply that he is \" as strong as the Pont- Neuf.\" The first -tone of the bridge was laid on Saturday, May 31, 1 578, by King Henri III., in presence of his mother, Queen Catherine de Medicis, his wife, Oueen Louise, and the principal officials of the kingdom. As the king had just been assisting at the obsequies of his favourites, Quelus and Maugiron, killed in a duel, he wa very melancholy, and the bridge acquired everywhere the name of the Bridge ot Tears. The idea of connecting the left bank with the island and the island with the right bank had been entertained by King Henri II. Henri Ill undertook to defray the cost of construction. But this fie did only in a theoretical way ; for three years after his death, in 1 592, the chief builder of the bridge, Guillaume Marchand. was still unpaid. The work, meanwhile, was far from"], [45, "THE REST OF KINGS.

Three arches ofthe principal arm had yet to be reared, and it was only in 1003 that the king was able to perform the ceremony of crossing the bridge from left bank to right ; part of the journey even then having to be made on a orary plank, so insecurely fixed that it was by a mere piece of royal luck that the venturesome monarch did ni er into the Seine. In undertaking the hazardous passage, he indicated to the friends who tried to dissuade him his belief in the \" divinity that doth hedge a king ; \" and he, in any case, failed 0 his perilous occasion either to break his neck or drown. The builder of the Pont-Neuf, Guillaume Marchand, was also its architect : so, at least, asserts his epitaph in the Church of St. Gervais : \"The celebrated architect,\" he i- called, \" who created two admirable works : ill. Royal Castle ot St. Germain and the Pont- Neuf of Paris.\" Marchand, however, died in 1004, so that although the bridge may have been originally planned by him, it is quite possible that the design may have been completed by another hand, and that the official title of \"architect to the bridge\" may have belonged to Baptiste du Cerceau, for whom it is often claimed. with an equestrian statue of himself in broi which is almost as celebrated as the bridge itself. The statue stands on the promontory ol the island between the two -pan- of the structure ; and from this point a magnificent view may be obtained of the course of the Seine above and below bridge. The original statue was the work of Jean de Bologne, and ot In- pupil, Pierre Tacca. It was unveiled on August 23rd, 1613, at which time the corners of the pedestal were adorned by four slaves, since removed, but still preserved in the museum of the Louvre. Three years later the populace dragged to the Pont-Neuf the maimed and lacerated body of Marshal d'Anere, and having cut it into pieces, burnt it before the statue. The so-called Marshal d'Anere \u2014 Concini, by his family name \u2014had come to Paris in the suite of Marie de Medicis, wife of Henri IV. He married one of the queen's attendants, and by intrigues and speculations of every kind succeeded in gaining a position of great influence, together with enormous wealth. He was known to be guilty of all sorts of abuses, and was suspected of having been privy to some of the attempts made upon the life of Henri IV. On the accession of Louis XIII., after the assassination of Henri IV. by Ravaillac, an ambush, not without the know ledge of Louis XIII., was laid for the marshal ; and, to the delight of the people of Paris, he fell into it. According to a legend of the period, his heart, after he had been slain, was cut out, roasted, and. eaten ! Henri IV., the first of the royal bou Bourbon, was the greatest of all the French kings, and at least the best of the kings of the Bourbon line. Such faults as undoubtedly belonged to him seem to have had no effect but to increase his popularity ; perhaps because, in a degree, they belonged also to the great mass of his subjects. This doubtful husband, good friend, and ex cellent ruler, beloved with warmth by his sub jects, was nevertheless made the object of numerous attempts at assassination, the last of which proved fatal. His would-be murderers were for the most part religious fanatics \u2014 as dangerous in that day as the fanatics of revolution in ours ; and to this class belonged Ravaillac, at whose hands Henri was destined to perish. Francis Ravaillac, the son of an advocate, was born and educated at Angouleme. When very ut;, he lived with one Rosieres, also a law ver, whom he served as clerk and valet. He rwards livid with other legal practitioners, and at length, on the death ot hi- last master, What is called the Pont-Neuf consists really of two bridges: one connecting the left bank with the island, the other stretching from the opposite side of the island shore to the right bank. According to its original plan, the Pont- Neuf, like all the old Paris bridges, was to support a number of houses for which cellars had bun constructed beforehand among the piles on which the bridge rested. Henri IV., however, refused to allow the intended houses to be built, determined not to spoil the view of the Louvre, which he had just constructed. Many years afterwards, however, in the reign of Louis XV., a number of little shops were raised on the Pont-Neuf, occupied bv match-sellers, sellers ot hot and cold drinks, dog-shearers, ! hand booksellers, chestnut-roasters, makers of pancakes and apple fritters, shoeblacks, quacks, and musicians more or less blind. These shops and stalls were maintained until the first d the Second Empire, when they disappeared. Henri IV. was determined to proclaim to future agi - his connection with the bridge of which he considered himself in some sen-, the autluir ; and on its completion he adorned it"], [46, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW. 1 1\u201e Pom Ni m. \" De profundis \" quite through, and declared that he seemed to have a trumpet in bis mouth, which made his voice as shrill and loud as that instrument in war. conducted lawsuit- for himself.

At an inn where he stopped for refresh ment he heard some soldiers talking about a design on the part of the king to make war against the Pope, and to transfer the Holy See to Paris. On this, his determination returned strong upon him ; and going out of the inn, he gave his knife a fresh point by rubbing it against a stone, and then turned his face towards Paris. II. continued in a state of intense anxiety, sometimes considering his project of assassination as praiseworthy, sometimes as unlawful. Shortly afterwards he attended Mass in the monastery of the Franciscan Friars at Angouleme, and going afterwards to confession, admitted, among other things, an intention to murder, though without saying that Henri was the proposed victim. Nor did th or inquire as to the details of the crime. Still restless and disturbed, Ravaillac went hack to Paris, and on entering the city, found ue to kill the king intensified.

At last, on the 17th of May, 1010, he saw him come out in a coach, and followed him for some distance, until the vehicle was stopped by two carts, which happened to get in the way. Here, as the king was leaning his head to speak to M. d'Epernon, who sat beside him, Ravaillac, in a frenzy, fancied he heard a voice say to him, \" Now is the time ; hasten, or it will be too late ! \" Instantly he rushed up to the coach, and standing on a spoke of the wheel, drew his knife and struck the king in the side. Finding, however, the knife impeded by one of the king's ribs, he gave him another \u2014 and this time a fatal \u2014 blow near the same In spite, however, of Eavaillac's protests, at this and at a subsequent examination, that he was quite without advisers, abettors, ur accomplices, the examiners would not believe him, and he was ordered to be put to the torture of the brodequin, or boot. This instrument, like its English counterpart, was a strong wooden box, made in the form of a boot, just big enough to contain both the legs of the criminal. When his legs had been enclosed, a wedge was driven in with a mallet between the knees ; and after this had been forced quite through, a second, and even a third wedge was employed in the same way. Ravaillac, having been sworn, was placed mia wooden bench, when the brodequin was fitted tu his legs. On the first wedge being driven in, he cried out : \"God have mercy upon 1, .- soul and pardon the crime I have committed; I ncvei disclosed my intention to anyone.\" When the second wedge was applied he uttered horrid cries and shrieks, and exclaimed : \" I am a sinner : I know no more than 1 have declared. I beseech the Court not to drive my soul to despair. Oh God ! accept these torments in satisfaction for my sins.\" A third wedge was then driven in lower, near his feet, on which his whole body broke into a sweat. Being now quite speechless, he was ed, witter was thrown in his face, and wine forced down his throat. He soon recovered by these means, and was then conducted to chapel by the executioner. But religious exhortation only caused him to repeat once more that he had no associate of any kind in connection with his crime. place. The king cried out that he was slain, and Ravaillac was seized by a retired soldier ot the guard. When searched, he was found to have upon him a paper painted with the arms ot France, and with a lion on each side, one holding a key, the other a sword. Above he had written these words: \"The name of God shall not be profaned in my presence.\" There was also dis covered a rosary and a piece of a certain root in the -hape ofa heart, which he had obtained as a charm against fever from the Capuchins, who .1 him that it had inside it a piece of the mss us the Saviour. \" This, however,\" says an ingenuous chronicler, \"when the heart was broken, proved to be false.\" Ravaillac was first examined by the President of the Parliament and several commissioners as to his motives tor committing the crime, and as to whether he liad accomplices. During the interrogation he often wept, and said that though at the time he believed the assassination to be a meritorious action, he now felt convinced that this was a delusion into which he had been suffered to fall as a punishment for his sins. He expressed the deepest contrition for his offence, and implored the Almighty to give him grace to continue till death in firm faith, lively hope, and perfect charity. At three in the afternoon of the 27th of May, 1 bio, he was brought from the chapel and put into a tumbril, the crowd in all directions being so great that it was with the utmost difficulty that the archers forced a passage. As soon as the prisoner appeared before the public gaze he was loaded with execrations from every side. After he had ascended the scaffold he was urged by two spiritual advisers to think of his salvation while there was time, and to confess all he knew ; but he answered precisely as before. As there seemed to be a prospect of the mur derer getting absolution from the Church, a great outcry was raised, and many persons crietl out that he belonged to the tribe of Judas, and must not be forgiven either in this world or the next. Ravaillac argued the point thus raised, main taining that haying made his confession he wa: entitled to absolution, and that the priest was bound by his office to give it. The priest replied that the confession had been incomplete, and, He denied that he had any confederate, and on being requested to say at whose instigation he did the deed, replied indignantly that it originated entirely with himself, and that for no reward would he have slain his king. He answered all other questions with great calmness and humility, and when he signed his confession, wrote beneath the signature these lines : \u2014 \" Que toujours en mon c\u0153ur Jesus soit le vainqueur.\""], [51, "RAVAILLAC The Pont-Neuf.] 35 therefore, insincere, and that absolution must be refused until Ravaillac named his accomplices.

Afterwards, at intervals, melted lead and scalding oil were poured into his wounds. During the whole time he uttered piteous cries and prayers. Finally, he was pulled in different directions for half-an-hour by four horses, though without being dismembered. The multitude, impatient to see the murderer in pieces, threw themselves upon him, and with swords, knives, sticks, and other weapons, tore, mangled, and finally severed his limbs, which they dragged through the and then burned in different parts of the city. Some of these wretches went so far as to cut off portions of the flesh, which they took home to burn quietly by their firesides. Apart from his own violent death, more than one tragic story is connected with the memory of Henri IV. Close to the Hotel de Ville stands ihi Hotel de Sens, where, in December, 1605, lived Marguerite de Valois, the divorced wife of Henri IV. Already in her fifty-fifth year, this lady bad by no means abandoned the levity of her youth. She had two lovers, both of whom were infatuated with her. The one she preferred, Saint- Julicn by name, had a rival in the person of a mere boy of eighteen, named Vermond, who had been brought up beneath the queen's eves. On the 5th of April, 1606, Marguerite, returning from Mass, drove up to the Hotel de Sens at the very moment when Vermont! and Saint-Julien were quarrelling about her. Saint-Julien rushed to open the carriage door, when Vermond drew a pistol and shot him dead. The queen \" roan a contemporary account, \"like a lioness.\" \" Kill him ! \" she cried. \" If you have 1 nis, take my garter and strangle him.\" The people whom her Majesty was addressing con tented themselves with pinioning the young man. The next morning a scaffold was raised before the Hotel de Sens, and Vcrmond had his head cut off in the presence of Marguerite, who, from one of the windows of her mansion, looked on at the execution. Then her strength gave way, and she fainted. The same evening she quitted the Hotel de Sens, never to return to it. At the time of the Revolution the mob at tacked the statue of Henri IV. on the Pont-Neuf, overturned it from its pedestal, and virtually de stroyed it. The present mi mument was erected by public subscription after the Restoration in 1814, and on the 25th of August, 1 8 1 8, was inaugurated by Louis XVIII. In the pedestal is enclosed a magnificent copy of Voltaire's epic \" LaHenriade.\" The low reliefs which adorn the pedestal of this admirable equestrian statue represent, on the southern side, Henri IV. distributing provisions in the besieged city of Paris ; on the northern side, the victorious king proclaiming peace from the steps of Notre-Dame. It has been said that the Pont-Neuf is tradi tionally famous for its solidity. In spite of this doubtless well-deserved reputation, the ancient bridge seemed, in 1805, on the point of giving way. Changes in the bed of the river had led to a partial subsidence of two of the arches supporting the smaller arm of the bridge. The necessary repairs, however, were executed, and the bridge's reputation for strength permanently restored. Among the many interesting stories told in connection with the Pont-Neuf may be mentioned one in which a famous actress of the early part of this century, Mile. Contat, plays a part She happened to be out in her carriage, and after a fashion then prevalent among the ladies of Paris, was driving herself, when, holding the reins with more grace than skill, she nearly ran over a pedestrian who was crossing the bridge at the same time as herself. In those days, when side-walks for pedestrians were unknown, the whole of the street being given up to people with carriages, it was easy enough to get run over ; and Mercier, in his \" Tableau de Paris,\" speaks again and again of the accidents that occurred through the haughty negligence and recklessness of carriage folk, and even of hirers of hackney coaches. A sufferer in these rather one-sided collisions was generally held to be in the wrong, and Mile. Contat reproached her victim with having deliberately attempted to throw himself under her horses' feet. The pedestrian took the"], [52, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW IThe Pont-Neuf. 36 whom she was so near running over, Mile. Contat complied with the prince's request. The piece was a comedy, with airs written by Baron Ernest von Manteuffel, and set to music by a composer of the day. The subject was extremely in teresting, and Mile. Contat saw that this musical comedy might prove an immense suce the Theatre Francais, where, being blame gallantly upon himself, bowed to the ground, offered the lady an apology, paid her a graceful compliment, and disappeared. Scarcely had he done so when the actress felt convinced, from his courtly manners and distinguished air, that she must have been on the point of mangling some personage of high rank, and for a long time duly produced, it fully realised the actress's anticipations. \" Les deux Pages \" it was called ; and the author, Prussian as he was, had written it in the French language, with which at that time the Court and aristocrai Prussia were more familiar than with their own tongue. It will be re membered that Frederick the Great (who, by the way, was the leading personage in \"Les deux Pa wrote the whole of his very volumin ous works in French. Mercier, in his \" Tableau de Paris,\" published at London in 1780 (its publication would not have permitted at Paris), gives an inter esting account of the Pont-Neuf as it existed in his time. \" This,\" he says, \" is the greatest thoroughfare in Paris. If you are in quest of any one, native or foreigner, there is a moral certainty of your meeting with him there in the space of two hi mrs, at the outside. The police-runners tire convinced of this truth ; here they lurk for their prey, and if, after a few days' look-out, they do not find it, they conclude with a certainty nearly equal to evidence that the bird is flown.

One night, about a month after the incident, when she was at the theatre, a letter from the gentleman whom she had accused of getting in the way of her horses was delivered to her. He proved to be not merely a person of high quality, as she had guessed, but a real live prince : Prince Henry, brother of the King of Prussia. He was a friend, moreover, of the drama ; and he had written to beg \"the modern Athalie\" to do him the honour to preside at the rehearsal of a new piece in which he was interested. Partly for the sake of the piece, but principally for that of the man boast of having in reality a good prince, they may comfort themselves in contemplating the effigy of a monarch whose like they will never again. At the foot of the bridge, a large phalanx of crimps \u2014 commonly called dealers in human flesh \u2014 have established their quarters, recruiting 6 ir their colonels, who sell the victims wholesale to the king. They formerly had recourse to violent means, but are now only permitted to use a little artifice, such as the employment of soldiers' trulls for their decoy-ducks, and plying with liquors those youngsters who are fond of the juice of the grape.

Mazarin, indeed, was so glad to have his enemy, the Count de Rochefort, in his power, that he could scarcely be prevailed upon to let him out at all. THE INSTITUTE. On the left bank of the Seine, at the very foot of the Pont-Neuf, stands the Institute of France, with its various academies, of which the most famous is that devoted to literature, the Academie Franchise, where, said Piron, \" there are forty members who have as much learning as four.\" \" This establishment,\" writes Mercier somewhat bitterly, but with much truth, \" was set on foot by Richelieu, whose every undertaking constantly tended to despotism. Nor has he in this institution deviated from the rule, for the Academy is manifestly a monarchical establish ment. Men of letters have been enticed to the capital like the grandees, and with the same object : namely, to keep a better watch over them. The consequence is fatal to the progress of knowledge, because every writer aspiring to a seat in that modern Areopagus knows that his success depends on Court favour, and therefore does everything to merit this by sacrificing tei the Goddess of Flattery, and preferring mean adula tion that brings him academical honours to the useful, manly, and legitimate employment of his talents in the instruction of mankind.

[The Pont-Neuf. 38 The Pont-Neuf was, for a considerable time after its first construction, the most important highway in Paris. It connected Paris of the left bank with Paris of the right, and old Paris, the so-called Cite, with both. It was the only bridge of importance; and what is now the greatest thoroughfare of Paris\u2014 the line of boule vards\u2014was not yet in existence. The Pont- Neuf dates from the reign of Henri IV. ; the boulevards from that of Louis XIV. Long, moreover, after it had ceased to be fashionable, the Pont-Neuf remained popular by reason ofthe vast stream of passengers perpetually crossing it in either direction. It was much in favour with itinerant dealers of all kinds, and equally se. with beggars. Even in our own time it was on the Pont-Neuf that Les deux Aveugles of < hi. deceived the public and exchanged confidences with one another. The plague of beggars is nothing, however, in these days, compared with what it was before the Revolution. \"Who,'1 asks a writer of the latter part of the eighteenth century, \" seeing the populace of Paris ever merry, and the rich glittering in all the gaudy pomp of luxury, would believe that the streets ut the metropolis are infested with swarms of beggars, were not the eve at every turn of the street shocked with some distressing spectacle, truly disgusting to the sight of every stranger who is not lost to all sense of humanity ? Nothing has yet been done to remove this evil, and the methods hitherto practised have proved to be remedies worse than the disease. Amongst the ancients there was a class of people that might be called poor, but none reduced to absolute indigence. The very slaves were clothed, fed, had their friends; nor does any historian say 'that the towns and streets were full of those wretched, disgusting objects which either excite pity or freeze charity itself: wretches covered with vermin did not then go about the streets uttering groans that reach the very heart, and exhibiting wounds that frighten the eye of every the Academy enjoys no manner of consideration either at home or abroad. Paris is the only place where it can support any kind ot dignity, dt it is even there sorely badgered by the wit- ofthe capital, who, expecting from it neither favour nor friendship, point all their epigram matical batteries against its members. There is, in fact, but too much room for pleasantry and keen sarcasm. Is it not extremely ridiculous that fortv men, two-thirds of whom owe their ad mission to intrigue or fawning, should be by patent created arbiters of taste in literature, and enjoy the exclusive privilege of judging for the rest of their countrymen? But their principal function has been to circulate and suppress new coined words ; regulating the pronunciation, orthography, and idioms of the French language. Is this a service or injury to the language? I should think the latter. \" Instead of becoming-, as they ought to do, the oracle of the age and their nation, our men of letters content themselves with being the echo of dread tribunal; hence the abject state of literature in the capital. We have some, how ever, who boldly think for themselves, trust to the judgment of the public, and laugh at the award of the Academy. Nothing can better mark the contempt in which a few spirited writers hold the decrees of the forty forestallers of French wit and refinement than the following epitaph which the author above cited, the terror of Voltaire, the scourge of witlings, Piron, ordered to be engraved on his tombstone : \u2014 Cy git l'iron, qui ne fut rien, l'as meme Aca.le-micien.' \" Many very distinguished writers have, in every generation since the birth of the Academy, been included aim ing its members. Very few, lu iwe\\ er, ofthe forty members have at any one time been men of genuine literary distinction ; a duke who has written a pamphlet, an ambassador who has published a volume, having always had a better chance of election than a popular novelist or dramatist. M. Arsene Houssaye has written a book entitled \"The Forty-first Chair,\" which is intended to show, and does show , that the greatest writer of each successive period, from Moliere to Balzac, has always been left out ofthe Academy : has occupied, that is to say, \" the forty-first chair.\" M.

In the very dead of night old men, women, and children were suddenly seized upon, deprived of their libertv, and thrown into loathsome gaols, without the assignment of any cause for so cruel a treatment. The pretence was that indigence is the parent of crimes, that seditions generally begin among that cla-s of people who, having nothing to lose, have nought to fear. The ministers who then wished to establish the corn-law dreaded the effect it would have mi that world of indigent wretches, driven to de spair, as they would be, by the advanced price of bread which was then to be imposed. Their oppressors said: 'They must be smothered;' and they were. As this was the most effectual method of silencing them, the Government never took the trouble to devise any other. When we cast an eve abroad, it is then we are convinced of the forlorn condition in which our lower sort of people drag out their miserable life. The Spaniard can cheaply provide himself with food and raiment. Wrapped up in his cloak, the earth is his bed ; he sleeps soundly, and wakes without anxiety for his next meal. The Italians work little, and are in no want of tin necessaries, or even luxuries, of life. The English, well fed, strong- and hale, happy and free, reap and enjoy undisturbed the fruits of their industry. The Swede is content with his glass of brandy. The Russian, whom no fore sight disturbs, finds abundance in the bosom of slavery ; but the Parisians, poor and helpless, sinking under the burden of unremitting toils and fatigue, ever at the mercy of the great, who crush them like vile insects whenever they attempt to raise their voice, earn, at the sweat of their brow, a scanty subsistence, which only serves to lengthen their lives, without leaving them anything to look forward to in their old but indigence, or, what is worse, part of a bed in the hospital.\" to death, the guillotine was at a later date set up. \"The executioner in Paris,\" says Mercier (writing just before the Revolution of i;s'i, \"enjoys a revenue of no less than l8,000 livres [\u00a3'20). His figure is perfectly well known to the populace ; he is for them the greatest tra gedian. Whenever he exhibits they crowd round his temporary stage : our very women, even those whom rank and education should inspire with the mildest sentiments, are not the last to share in tbe horrid spectacles he provides. I have seen some of these delicate creatures, whose fibres tire so tender, so easily shaken, who faint at the sight of a spider, look unconcerned upon the execution of Damiens, being the last to avert their eves from the most dreadful punishment that ever was devised to avenge an offended monarch. The bourreau, although his employ ment brands him with infamy, has no badge to distinguish him from the rest of the citizens ; and this is a great mistake on the part of the Govern ment, particularly noticeable when he executes the dreadful commands of the law. It is not only ridiculous : it is shocking in the extreme, to see him ascend tbe ladder, his head dressed and profusely powdered ; with a laced coat, silk stockings, and a pair of as elegant pumps as ever set off the foot of the most refined petit-maitre. Should he not be clad in garments more suitable to the minister of death ? What is the conse quence of so gross an absurdity ? A populace not overburdened with the sense of sympathy are all taken up with admiration for the hand some clothes and person ofour Breakbones. Their attention is engrossed bv the elegant behaviour and appearance of this deputy of the King of Terrors: they have hardly a thought to bestow upon the malefactor, and not one on his suffer ings. Of course, then, the intention of the law is frustrated. The dreadful example meant to frighten vice from its criminal course has no effect on the mind of the spectator, much more attentive to the point ruffles and the rich clothes of the man whose appearance should concur in adding to the solemnity than to the awful memento set up by a dire necessity to enforce the practice of virtue by showing that he who lives in crime must die in infamy. The execu tioner, from the stigma inherent to his prof and of course to himself, cannot hope to form alliances among the other ranks of citizens.

It is not many years since the Bourreau of Paris publicly advertised that he was ready to bestow the hand of his daughter, with a portion of one hundred thousand crowns, on any native Frenchman who would accept it, and agree to succeed him in business. The latter clause would have staggered avarice itself ; but the execu tioner of Paris was obliged to follow the practice of his predecessors in office, and marry his heiress to a provincial executioner. These gentlemen, in works, the emperor replied by ordering the man to be arrested and confined in a lunatic asylum. Under the Restoration many a volume was pro. scribed ; but since the great Revolution of i;,S., no Government in France has ventured to restore the custom of having a condemned book burnt by the executioner. When, in connection with the contest on the subject of the Church's relationship with the stage, a very able pamphlet was published, proving by the laws of France that the excommunication levelled against the stage was an illegal and scandalous imposition, THE PONT-NEUF FKO.M THE ISLAM humble imitation of our bishops, take their surnames from the cities where they are settled, and among themselves it is ' Monsieur de Paris,' ' Monsieur de Rouen,' etc. etc.\" Re-ides breaking the bones of the criminals entrusted to his charge, torturing them in various way-, and ultimately putting them to death, the executioner, under the old regime, had sometimes to perform upon books, which he solemnly burnt on the Place de Greve. Russia, Turkey, and the Roman Court are now the only Powers in Europe which maintain a censorship over hooks. But the custom of burning objec tionable volume-, in-tead of simply pronouncing against them and forbidding their circulation, belong- altogether to the past. Plenty of books were forbidden in France under the First and 1 Empire ; and when the infamous Marquis le sent Napoleon one of his disgraceful it got condemned to be burnt in the Place de Greve by the executioner. Whereupon Voltaire, indignant at the barbarity of such a punishment, brought out, anonymously, another pamphlet in defence of the cremated one, when this, in its turn, was sentenced to the flames.

The shepherds and herdsmen of the province possessed, it was said, the power of putting to death the sheep and cattle of their neighbours by burying various kinds of enchantments beneath the paths along which the animals were sure to pass. Some of these wonder-working- shepherds were taken and prosecuted, when they confessed in many cases that they had exercised various kinds of bedevilments on the beasts of certain farmers. They made known the composition of their infernal preparations, but refused to state where they were buried, declaring that if they were dug up the person who had deposited them would immediately die. Whether the reputed sorcerers possessed the secret of some chemical mixtures which had really an injurious effect on cattle, or whether they were merely actuated by vain fancies, it would be impossible at the present time to say. But many shepherds and herdsmen of La Brie were, towards the end ofthe seventeenth century, condemned and executed fur magical practices. \u2022 Thus two shepherds, named Biaule and Lavaux, were sentenced by the same judge to be hanged and burnt ; and the sentence, after being confirmed bv the Parliament of Paris, was put into effect on the t 8th of December, i6qi. to encourage magical practices ; and in succeeding reigns the very people who. under her auspices, had cultivated relations with the fiend were punished for their tamperings with the super natural. Catherine patronised astrologers and sor cerers of all kinds ; and she was accused of holding in the woods levees of magicians, who arrived at the place of meeting on flying goats, winged horses, or even simple broomsticks. The as sembly, according to popular rumour, began at night, and ended with cock-crow. The place selected for the \"Sabbath\" was lighted by a single lamp, which cast a melancholy light, and intensified rather than dispelled the prevailing darkness. The president of the \" Sabbath \" was the fiend in person, who took his seat on a high throne, clad with the skin of a goat or ot an immense black poodle. On his right was the solitary lamp, on his left a man or woman who had charge of the powders or ointments which it was customary to distribute among those present. The ointments were supposed to enable the members of these strange associations to recog nise on* another by the smell. But there is so much that is evidently false and so little that is apparently true in the accounts transmitted to us of these witches' Sabbaths, that the only thing worth noting in connection with them is that they possessed the privilege of interesting Catherine tie .Medicis. The secret meetings ot the Templars, the Anabaptists, and the Albi genses have all been represented as assemblies of sorcerers. In the \" History of Artois,\" by Dom de Vienne, it is said that the Inquisition established in the province caused many unfortunate Wal denses to be burnt alive in consequence of diabolical practices, \"to which,\" as the Inquisi tion declared, \"they themselves confessed\" Magical practices have been denounced by more than one Church council ; nor were incantations and witchcraft supposed by any means to be confined to the ignorant classe-, Pharamond passed for the son of an incubus ; ami the mother of Clovis tor a witch. Fre degi inde accused Clovis, son of her husband Chilperic and a former wife, of sorcery ; and it was not until the reign of Charlemagne that any endeavour was made to destroy the popular belief in magic. After Charlemagne's death witchcraft took a greater hold on the public mind than ever ; and ridiculous historians wrote that Queen Berthe had given birth to a gosling and that Bertrade was a witch. Philip the Bold consulted a sorceress. The madness of Charles VI. and the influence exercised upon him by Valentine of Milan were ascribed to magic ; and it was as a witch that the Maid of Orleans was burnt. It may well be that the severity of the tortures inflicted on the accused, and the promise held out to them of forgiveness in case ot avowal, induced many of them to admit the truth of charges without basis.

Stroll about the boulevards for a few hours \u2014 an occupation of which the true boule vardier seems never to get tired \u2014 and you will veryone you know in Paris. which she presents on the Boulevard de la .Made leine, which the visitor may reach by omnibus, though it is more interesting to travel m hired vehicle which may now and then be stopped, and more interesting still to make the whole ofthe three-mile journey on foot. At either end of tbe line of boulevards is a Place, or open space, which, for want ofa better word, may be called a square : Place de la Bastille to the east, Place de la Madeleine to the west. The omnibuses which ply between the two extremities bear the inscription \"Madeleine \u2014 Bastille\" ; and, beginning at the Bastille, the traveller passes eleven different boulevards, or, rather, one boulevard bearing in succession eleven different names : Beaumarchais, des Fillcs du Calvaire, du Temple, Saint-Martin, Saint- Denis, Bonne-Nouvelle, Poissonniere, Mont martre, des Italiens, des Capucines, and de la Madeleine. If, moreover, the upper boulevards, those of th. Madeleine, the Capucines, and the Italiens, represent fashionable Paris, the lower boulevards, from the Boulevard Montmartre to the Boule vard Beaumarchais, represent the Paris of com merce and of industry ; so that the line of boulevards, as a whole, from the .Madeleine to the Bastille, gives a fair epitome of the French capital. Advancing from the Bastille to the .Madeleine, we find the appearance of the shops constantly improving, until, from poor at one end, they become magnificent at the other. What the military authorities of Germany call \"necessary luxuries\" (such as coffee, tea, and sugar), as well as luxuries in a more absolute sense (such as costly articles of attire, sweetmeats, and eham- i, are sold all along the line. But at the Bastille end one n< tices here and there a little sacrifice to the useful and the indispensable. In deed, on the lower boulevards grocers' shops are to be found, though nothing so commonplace offends the eve on the boulevards to which the name of \" upper \" is given. The poorest of the boulevards are at the east ern end of the line, and the richest at the 1 n ; and tbe difference in character between the inhabitants of these opposite extremes is shown by a military regulation instituted under the Second Empire. Neither the district inhabited bv the n a kitten of the east nor the western district, where dwelt the richest d shop-keepers, was allowed to furnish the Usual contingent ot National Guards. The artisans were too turbulent to be entrusted with arms, while the tradespeople were equally un reliable, because from timidity they allowed their arms to be taken from them. In like manner, the importance ofthe theatres increases as you proceed from the Bastille West ward. Nearly half the playhouses of Paris are on the boulevards: ten on the north side, and three on the south. Many other theatres, if not entered direct from the boulevards, are in their close vicinity. The theatre nearest the Madeleine is the new- Opera House ; that nearest the Place de la Bastille is the Theatre Beau marchais. The Boulevard Beaumarchais owes its name to the brilliant dramatist who, among lining at what most visitors to Paris will consider the wrong end ofthe line of boulevards, we find that on the Boulevard Beaumarchais . very different physiognomy from that"], [60, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW. [The Boulevards. 44 At the beginning of 1782 it was already a question who could obtain the privil. . hearing the play read by Beaumarchais\u2014 an admirable reciter \u2014 whether at his own house or in some brilliant salon. \"Every day,\" writes Madame Campan, \"persons were heard to say; ' I was present, or I shall be present, at a reading of Beaumarchais's piece.' \" other works, wrote the Barber of Seville and the Marriage of Figaro, still familiar to all Europe in their musical form. From 1760 to 183) what is now called the Boulevard Beau marchais was known as the Boulevard St.- Antoine. In the last-named year, however, under the government of Louis Philippe, it was determined to render homage to the author of the best comedies in the French language after those of Moliere by naming a boulevard after him. The first performance of the Mam,,. Figaro was thus described by a competent judge. \"Never,\" says Grimm, in one ot tin letters addressed by him and by Diderot to the Grand Duke of Saxe-Gotha, \" never did a piece attract such crowds to the Theatre Francais. All Paris wished to see this famous ' marriage,' and the house was crammed almost the very moment the doors were opened to the public. Scarcely half of those who had besieged the doors since -ight in the morning succeeded in finding places. Most persons got in by force or by throwing money to the porters. It is impossible to be more humble, more audacious, more in view of obtaining a favi nir fn mi the Court than were all our young lords to ensure themselves a place at the first representation of Figaro. More than one duchess considered herself too happy that day to find in the balconies, where ladies are seldom seen, a wretched stool side by side with .Madame Duthe, Carline, and company.\" The Marriage of Figaro was played in public for the first time on April 27th, 1 7S4. \" The description of the first performance is,\" says M. de Lomenie, \"in every history of the period \" ; for which insufficient reason M. de Lomenie omits it in his own history of \" Beau marchais and his Times.\" For at least two years before the Marriage of Figaro was played in public the work must have been well known in the aristocratic and literary circles of Paris. The brilliant comedy, which was not to be brought out until April, I 7 S4, had been accepted at the Theatre Francais in October, 1781. \"As -. mu as the actors,\" writes Beaumarchais, \" had received, by acclamation, my poor Mar riage, which has since had so many opponents, ged M. Lenoir (the Lieutenant of Police) to appoint a censor; at the same time asking him, as a special favour, that the piece might be examined by no one else : which he readily promised ; assuring me that neither secretary nor clerk should touch the manuscript, and that the play should be read in his own cabinet. It was so read by M. Coqucley, advocate, and I .1 M. Lenoir to notify what he retrenched, objected to, or approved. Six weeks afterwards I learnt in society that my piece had been read at all tbe soirees of Versailles, and I was in ir at this complaisance \u2014 perhaps forced \u2014 of the magistrate in regard to a work which still belonged to me ; for such was certainly not the austere, discreet, and loyal course which belongs to the serious duty ofa censor. Well or illread \u2014 perhaps maliciously mutilated \u2014 the piece was pronounced detestable ; and not knowing in what respect I had sinned (for according to custom nothing was specified), I stood before the inquisition obliged to guess my crimes, but aware, nevertheless, that I was already tacitly proscribed. As, however, this proscription by the court only irritated the curiosity of the town, I was condemned to readings without number.

Dazineourt repre sented Figaro with all his wit, and re lieved the character from any appear ance of vulgarity. Old Pre ville, who was not less successful in the part of Bridoison, gave it up after a few days in Dugazon, who interpreted it with more power and equal intelligence. Delessarts, with his rich humour, gave relief to the personage of Bartholo, which is thrown somewhat into the back ground. The secondary parts of Basil and Antonio were equally well played tor the insignificant little part ot Grippe-soleil. \"Idle success of this Aristophanic comedy,\" write.- De Lomenie, \" while it filled some persons with anxiety and alarm, naturally roused the curious crowd, who are never wanting, par ticularly when a successful person takes a pleasure in spreading his tame abroad \u2014 and this foible of Beau marchais i- well known.

In eight months, from April 27th, 17*4, till January 10th, [785, the piece brought the Theatre Francais, without counting the fiftieth representation (which, at Beaumarchais's request, was given tor the poor), no less than 540,107 livres or francs ; an immense sum for that period. When all ex- \u25a0 had been paid, there remained a profit ot 293,735 livres for division amongst the actors, after the deduction from it of Beaumarchais's share as author, amounting to 41,400 livres. C\u0153ur, a marble tablet sets forth that the bouse in question occupies the site of the outlying building into which the assailants, on the 14th of July, 1 7 s > . made their way before storming the fortress itselt. The cafe which stands at the corner of the street and of the square bears for its sign, \"The Cannon ofthe Bastille.\" It was less as a fortress than as a State prison that the Bastille was known, and by the nation at large execrated. Prisoners were taken to the Bastille on a simple lettre dc cachet : a sealed order or warrant, which was sometimes given out blank, so that the favoured recipient might make whatever use of it he pleased, against no matter whom. The victims were introduced secretly into the fortress ; and the soldiers mi guard had instructions to turn aside when any prisoner was being brought in, so that they might not afterwards recognise him. Once inside the dungeon, he was liable to undergo frequent interrogations without even knowing on what charge, or even suspicion, he had been arrested. The treatment in prison depended absolutely on the will ofthe governor. Those under detention were kept in solitary confine ment, without anyone outside being able to obtain news as to whether they even existed. They were not allowed to receive letters from their family or friends. The internal regulations of the Bastille are sufficiently well known to us by the numerous chronicles and memoirs pub lished in connection with it, including, in parti cular, those of Linguet. \" During the seven years that I passed in the Bastille,\" says M. Pclissery, quoted by Linguet, \"I had no air even in fine weather, and in winter they gave me nothing in the way of fuel except wood just taken from the river. My bed was intolerable, and the bedclothes dirty and worm-eaten. I drank, or rather poisoned myself with, foul stagnant water. What food they brought me ! Famished dogs would not have touched it. Accordingly, my body was soon covered with pustules, my legs gave way beneath me, I spat blood, and becai .e scorbutic. The dungeons received neither light nor air, except by one narrow window pierced in a wall nearly five metres thick, and traversed by a triple row nt bars, between which there were intervals id only five centimetres. Even on the most beautiful days the prisoners received but feeble rays of light. In the winter these fatal caves resembled ice-houses, being sufficiently raised for the cold to penetrate ; while in summer All sorts of anecdotes were told in connection with the success of the work. A gentleman \u2014 whom gossip transformed into a duke \u2014 wrote to Beaumarchais, asking for a loge grillee tor him self and two ladies who wished to see the piece without being seen. Beaumarchais replied that he had no sympathy with persons who wished to combine \" the honours of virtue with the pleasures of vice\"; and, moreover, that bis comedy was work which honourable persons need be ashamed to see. The Boulevard Beaumarchais of the present day was (as already mentioned) called, until some fifty years after the Revolution, Boulevard St.- Antoine ; where, until 17X0, the year of its destruction, Stood the celebrated fortress and prison of the Bastille. The destruction of the Bastille was tbe first event in the French Revo luti >n ; and many have asked why the fury of the crowd was particularly directed against a building which, monument of tyranny though it was, had never been employed against the pet >plc at large, but almost always against members of the aristocracy, on whose behalf the Revolutionists were certainly not fighting. But although the dungeons of the Bastille were for the most part filled with political offenders, persons of every station in life did, from time to time, find themselves enclosed within its walls. The too celebrated fortress was originally built to protect the east of Paris, as the Louvre was constructed to guard the west. It stood on the south side of the boulevard now known by the name of Beaumarchais, and consisted of eight towers, four of which looked towards the town \u2014 that is to say, the Rue St. -Antoine \u2014 and four towards the country \u2014 that is to say, the Faubourg St. -Antoine.

There are some rooms \u2014 and mine was one of them \u2014 which look out directly upon the moat into which flows the great sewer of the Rue St. -Antoine. Thence ascends a pes tilential exhalation, which, when once it has entered these rooms, can only with much diffi culty be got out again. It is in such an atmo sphere that the prisoner has to breathe. There, not to be absolutely stifled, he is obliged to pass his nights and days glued to the inside bars of the little window in the door, through which a glimmer of light and a breath of air may reach him.\" of the Ministers had said, \"we will burn it.\" Paris was, indeed, surrounded with foreign troops ; and whatever might be the attitude ot the French regiments, commanded by officers some ot whom were Royalists and others Republicans, it was certain that the popular movement would have to count with the Swiss, Austrian, and German troops stationed at Charenton, Sevres, Versailles, at the Military School, and elsewhere in the immediate neighbourhood of the capital. On the 8th of July the National Assembly had, on the motion of Mirabeau, demanded from the king the removal of the foreign troops. The king's only reply, a few days afterwards, was to dismiss Necker, the popular Minister. The news of this tyrannical step fell upon Paris on Sunday, July I2th, like a spark on tt barrel of gunpowder. The Palais Royal, which might be regarded as the head-quarters of the Revolu tion, became violently agitated. It was twelve o'clock on a hot summer's day when suddenly the midday cannon, with its lens above the touch-hole, was fired by the blazing sun. \" The history of the Bastille as a S e prison,\" \\loiigin, \"might almost be said o include everything intellectual and political in France. Into its dungeons were thrown, one after the other, Hugues ; Aubriot, who himself founded the Bastille, and who expiated by perpetual im prisonment his alleged heresy and his love nlalioiis with a Jewess; Jacques d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours, in 1475 ; with many high and powerful noblemen in the time of Louis XL and Richelieu. Here also were confined Marshal tie Biron and bouquet, the Superintendent of Finances, besides more than one officer of dis tinction under Louis XIV.\" A superstitious importance was attached to the familiar incident ; and the Revolutionists, with the people around them, saw in the ordinary explosion of a midday gun, intended only to interest the public by marking tbe time, the signal for an uprising against the ancient monarchy. A young man of twenty, then abso lutely unknown, but who was afterwards to be remembered as Camille Desmoulins, rushed out of the Cafe Foy, sprang upon a table just outside, and in impassioned language addressed the crowd. \" Citizens,\" he cried, \" there is not a moment to lose! I have just come from Versailles. Necker is dismissed, and his dismissal is the signal for a new massacre of St. Bartholomew. This evening all the Swiss and German battalions will march from the Champ-de-Mars to put to death every patriot. We have but one resource : to rise to arms, after assuming cockades by which we may recognise each other. What colours do you prefer \u2014 green, the colour of hope, or the blue of Cincinnatus, the colour of American liberty and of democracy ? \" When the Bastille had done its work on the hist remains of feudalism and on the Court aristocracy, the turn came of the people \u2014 the precursors of the Republic, the martyrs of the Revolution. After the revocation ofthe Edict of Nantes, the Bastille was filled with Protestants. Here were shut up the Jansenists and the fanatics known as the Convulsionnaires. Here, too, suffered, until he was taken to the scaffold, the brave Governor of India under the French domination, Lally, who had given offence to the Court rather than to the sovereign. Voltaire, Mira' ', Linguet (who, after making his escape, pub . n London his eloquent account of the s to which prisoners in the Bastille were si, r ctctl), Latude, and numberless other men distinguished in different walks of life. The 14th of July, 1789, saw the first blow struck by the Revolutionists against that monu ment which, to them, symbolised all that was hateful in the ancient monarchy. War had ..Iv virtually been declared between the two -ides. Everything seemed in favour of the kii the Court, the nobility, anil the monarchical party generally. \"If Paris must be burnt,\" one \" Green, green ! \" cried the crowd. \" Friends,\" continued the young man, in a sono rous voice, \" the signal is already given.

Soon the \u2022 the Palais Royal garden were stripped. Tiic excitement and enthusiasm spread in every JUNCTION OF GRAND BOULEVARDS AND RUE AND FAUBOURG MONTMARTRE. direction. Arms were seized wherever they could be found. The busts of Necker and of the Duke of Orleans, idols of the moment, were carried through the streets veiled with black crape. More than one detachment ofthe French Guards joined the crowd. In the Tuileries Gardens several persons were killed by a cavalry charge under the command of Prince de Lam besc, of which the chief effect was to exasperate the insurgents to the utmost. Partial engage ments now took place at various points. At the gates of Paris, the barriers where a tax was levied on provisions brought into the city were set in flames. Towards evening committees -were formed in all the districts of the capital \"for preventing tumult.\" The shops were now everywhere closed, and the theatres gave no performances. During the night the district assemblies held a general meeting, at which it was resolved to urge all who possessed arms to bring them to district head-quarters, that militia companies, to be promptly formed for the occa sion, might be furnished therewith in a regular taken as the well-to-do citizens of the hurriedly constituted district assemblies thought advisable.

The Hotel de Ville, \"from which he held forth, was now occupied in every corner by armed men, who had no intention of giving their weapons up for the equipment of any imaginary militia company ; and as yet these companies were unformed. An order to evacuate the Hotel de Ville met with no attention, and delibera tions were now carried on beneath the eyes and under the pressure of the enraged mob. In place of the green colour adopted in the first instance by the insurgents of the Palais Royal, which the day afterwards was rejected as the family colour of the Counts of Artois, the tricolour had now been assumed : blue, in the new flag, being held to signify hope ; red, the"], [65, "The Boulevards, j THE BASTILLE. 49 blood of sacrifice; and white, the ancient monarchy, against which war had not yet been declared. It was against the abuses of the ancient system, and in view of a thorough reform, that the people were rising. Camille Desmoulins had begun the Revolu tion on Sunday, the irth of July, at noon. On the morning of Monday, July 13th, the alarm bell was rung in every church, and the drum beaten in every street. Bands were now formed, without much system, under the names of Volunteers of the Palais Royal, of the Tuileries, etc. Women were everywhere making blue and red cockades \u2014 the white was not absolutely essential ; the blacksmiths were forging arms ; and it has been calculated that in thirty-six fifty thousand pikes were made. Tumul- meetings were held in the churches, with a view to some legular organisation of the from Government stores, sacks of wheat and flour (stopped at the barriers), and even herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, were brought. Paris was being turned into a camp. The citizens of the district assemblies, carried away by the ardour of the people whose impetuosity they had sought to restrain, the students of the various schools, the clerks of the public offices, the workmen of the faubourgs : all hurried to the Hotel de Ville, swearing to conquer or to die. The fact that Paris was threatened by Swiss, German, and various kinds of Austrian troops could not but awaken the patriotism of Frenchmen generally. The first enemy to be fought was the army of foreigners waiting to swoop down on the cit)-. An important col lection of arms, formed by those who had -obeyed the first recommendations of the district assem blies, was reported to exist at the Invalides ; THE BASTILLE movement. A Government depot of arms was invaded, and plundered of its contents.

[The Boulevards. 50 private malice. The terrible lettre de cachet, on the strength of which arrests were made without further explanation, had indeed become a purchasable thing, with a fixed price, like any other article of commerce. It was doubtless, however, the memory of a long course of ancient wrongs that, above all, animated the people in their rage against the Bastille. There was, more over, however, a strategical reason. As a fortress, the Bastille commanded the Rue St. -Antoine and the adjoining faubourg, and indeed dominated all Paris. To destroy it, therefore, was consi dered at once a good moral and a good military act. ddie governor, De Launay, had already pre pared his defence ; and in addition to the guns of position in the towers, he had placed anumher in the interior COU sard. Tbe gates and the outer walls had bed' loopholed and armed with wall-pieces, and a quantity of paving-stones, cannon-balls, and lumps of iron had been carried up to the towers, in order to be hurled down upon the heads of the expected assailants. The garrison consisted only of 114 men, 3: us whom were Swiss, while the other 82 were old pensioners, ddie defenders, indeed, were nearly all of them aged, but experienced, soldiers. Their material appliances and the strength of their position were such that the governor looked upon the fortress as impregnable against a mob of people who had neither the art nor the time to undertake regular siege operations. With his powerful batteries, De Launay could lay the whole quarter in ruins ; and foreseeing this possibility, the committee of the Hotel de Ville sent a deputation to the governor, promising not to attack him if he would withdraw the cannon, and promise not on his side to begin hostilities. A man of more energy, Thuriot de la Rozifere, called, in the name of his district, upon the governor, and demanded the surrender of the fortress. His account of what was taking place in Paris astonished De Launay, and gained the sympathy of the French portion of the garrison. His final demand was that the Bastille should be occupied by some of the newly-formed bandl conjointly with troops of the regular army. But this proposition, though more advanced than the feeble one made by the committee of the Hotel de Ville, was by no means on a level with popular demands ; and Thuriot, on leaving the Bastille, was threatened by the armed bands assembled outside, who demanded, not the occu- pation of the Bastille, but its destruction. A few brave men got into the outer y3M seized, carried to the Hotel de Ville, and partially distributed. No movement, meanwhile, had been made by the foreign troops, who were for the most part encamped or quartered in the Ecole Militaire ; the inaction being attributable to divided counsels among the king's ministers, and to hesitation on the part ofthe king himself. The one thing de cided upon was to stop the entrance of provisions into Paris : a sure means, it was thought, of reduc ing the tumult, which at the outset was scarcely looked upon as serious. The National Assembly was behaving, meanwhile, in the most heroic manner. Threatened with dissolution and arrest, and quite at the mercy of the foreign troops, it voted an expression of regret at the dismissal ot Necker, a demand that tbe foreign troops be forthwith sent away from Paris, and a declaration that the king's ministers, whatever their rank, would be held personally responsible for tiny mis fortunes that might result from the present condition of things. On tbe morning of the 14th of July Paris was surrounded at all points by foreign troops, and was at the same time threatened with famine. But one course was open to the insurgents : that of immediate action. There was a general feeling that an attack must be made, and the object unanimously chosen for the first assault was the Bastille : symbol of everything hateful in the government it was proposed to overturn. \"A la Bastille.'\" was now tbe universal cry. But a dearth of muskets retarded the impulse, and it was determined in the first instance to attack the Hotel des Invalides, where arms in large numbers were known to be stored away. Thirty thousand men hurried to the asylum of aged soldiers; when, without much time being wasted in parleying with the governor, the sentinels were seized and the place entered by force. In the cellars twenty -eight thousand muskets were discovered concealed beneath hay and straw ; and with these the invaders, whose numbers had gradually increased, hastened ti 1 arm themselves. Five years before, the king, on consenting to the liberation of Latude, had promised that henceforth no one should be sent to the Bastille except for a definite period, and after formal conviction on a positive charge. But this engagement had not been kept; people had been arrested, and incarcerated (as at the present time in Russia) on the simple denun ciation of police officers and spies ; sometimes on mere suspicion, at others without even suspicion, and simply for the gratification of"], [67, "THE TAKING OF THE BASTILLE. 51 1 he Uoulevards.] possible to renew the supply. It was evident that all Paris demanded the fall of the Bastille. The Swiss, however, would hear of no surrender. As for De Launay, he felt that he was per sonally detested, not only for the blood he was uselessly shedding, but even more for his perse cution of the prisoners under his charge. The Memoirs of Linguet and other revelations had made his name odious throughout Europe. Thus the vengeful cries of the people Seemed directed against himself personally. Wild with terror, he seized a match, and was about to explode his powder magazine, when two non commissioned officers drove him back at point of bayonet. Outside, a sort of organisation had now established itself. Many bands of volun teers had been moving together since the first uprising, with the volunteers of the Palais Royal, under Camille Desmoulins, among them. These bands were under the command ot officers ot the French Guards, or of energetic men who were afterwards to distinguish themselves in the military career. through the roof of the guard-house, ami at once destroyed with hatchets the chains ot the draw bridge leading to the inner yard. They were followed bv others, and soon the outer gates were forced. A terrible fire had been opened on the crowd of assailants, and it was resolved once more to approach De Launay by means of a deputation, which, however, was unable to reach him. At this moment the besiegers set fire to several carts of hay and manure, in order to burn the buildings which masked the fortress and to smoke out the defenders. At the same time, a constant tire was kept up from the windows and roofs of the neighbouring houses. All this, bowever, had but little effect on the garrison. Anew deputation was now sent forward, bearing a white flag. A white flag was displayed in reply from the Bastille, ami the soldiers reversed their muskets. An officer of the Swiss troops passed forward a note, bv means of a crane, with these words : \" We have twenty thousand pounds of powder, and we will blow up the fortress and the whole of the neighbourhood unless you accept a capitulation.\" According to some accounts, the surrender of the fortress took place immediately after the episode ot the note thrust forward on a crane, or, according to another version, pushed through a loophole. The moment in any case arrived when, promised by some of the French Guards that their lives should be spared, the garrison agreed formally to surrender. The drawbridges were now lowered, and the Bastille was occupied in force. On being recognised, De Launay was arrested and led off towards the Hotel de Ville. Hulin, afterwards one of Napoleon's generals and nobles, took charge of the prisoner, and, forming an escort, did his best to convey him safely through the infuriated mob, which, with execrations, pressed towards him from all sides. More than once De Launay was thrown down. Having lost his hat, he was now tin easier mark than ever for the assaults of the crowd. That he might not so readily be distinguished, Hulin gave him his own hat, thus running the risk of being himself mistaken for the odious governor. At last Hulin and several members of the escort were thrown together to the ground ; and when Hulin managed to rise, the head of the hated governor was being carried aloft on the point of a pike. The Commissaries of the Hotel de Ville, believing in the pacific demonstrations of the garrison, were already urging the people tt) retire, when suddenly there was a discharge of musketry from the fortress, which laid low a gond number of the insurgents. It was ap parently the Swiss who bail fired, heedless ol the conciliatory attitude assumed by the French portion of the defending force. The whole garrison was held responsible for this act of *'-\u2022\u25a0 tcliery.

Shocking as this detail may be to a reader of the present day, it should be remembered that under the old monarchy torture was constantly employed in criminal process. It is only just to add that it was formally abolished a few years before the Revolution, and not afterwards, as is generally suppi \u00abed. the duke ; \" it is a revolution.\" In these words, destined to become celebrated, the astonished king was informed that the ancient monarchy was at an end. The Bastille was now pulled down : partly in the natural course of things, partly in virtue of a formal resolution. The stones were broken up into little pieces, and worn by ladies as jewellery ; ornaments and playthings were also made from the remains of the detested edifice. The conquerors of the Bastille formed a special corps, which had its recognised place in all public ceremonies. A medal was struck in their honour, and each of them was commissioned with an office. During the Revolution the ground mi which the Bastille stood became a favourite place for public meetings. The Bronze Column which now lifts its head in the Place de h Bastille was erected under the reign of Louis Philippe, in memory of the Revolution of 1789 and of the lesser revolt of 1830. Although the Revolution began in Paris, the revolutionary spirit spread rapidly to thi vinces. This is clearly set forth in Arthur Young's account of what took place at Strasburg, where he had just arrived when news of the Revolution reached him. \" I arrived there,\" he writes, \" at a critical moment, which I thought would have bmken my neck : a detachment of horse, with their trumpets, on one side, a party of infantry, with their drums beating, on the other, and a mob hallooing, frightened my French mare, and I could scarcely keep her from trampling on Messrs. the tiers ctat. On arriving at the inn, one heard the interesting news of the revolt d Paris; the Garde Francaise joining the people; the unreliability of the rest of the troops ; the taking of the Bastille ; and the institution of the mi/ice bourgeoise \u2014 in a word, the absolute over- throw of the old government. Everything being now decided, and the kingdom absolutely in the I hands of the Assembly, they have the power to make a new constitution such as they think proper ; and it will be a spectacle for the world to view in this enlightened age the representative! of twenty-five millions of people sitting on the construction of a new and better fabric of liberty than Europe has yet offered. It will now be seen whether they will copy the constitution ot England, freed from its faults, or attempt from theory to frame something absolutely speculative. In the former case they will prove a blessing to 1 their country ; in the latter they will probably involve it in inextricable contusion and civil The archives of the prison were in part de stroyed. All that was preserved of them was afterwards published, in order once more to throw light on the iniquity of the system under which such an institution as the Bastille could exist. The taking of the Bastille cost the assailants eighty-three killed on the spot, and fifteen who died from their injuries, besides sixty-three wounded. The garrison, on their side, protected by the walls of the fortress, lost but one killed and one wounded during a struggle which lasted five hours. The major of the garrison, De Losme, shared the fate of the governor, except that, instead of being put to death summarily by an enraged mob, he was taken deliberately to the famous lanterne, or lamp of the Place de la Greve, and hanged. Two of the pensioners, accused, like the major, of having pointed the guns of the fortress against the people, were also strung up. These were the first victims of the cry \" .-/ la lanterne!\" afterwards to be beard so often in the streets of Paris. The lanterne in question was attached to an iron gibbet ; and it was on this gibbet that the victims of popular fury were hoisted aloft. The lives of all the other defenders were spared. They were set at liberty and a subscrip tion opened for them, as they had now no means of earning an honest penny. The news of the capture of the Bastille caused great excitement at Versailles, where Louis XVI., in his habitual state of indecision, seemed unable to give an order of any kind. He had gone to bed at his usual hour, but was awakened early the next morning by the Duke de Liancourt, who enjoyed the privilege ot entering the royal bedchamber tit any time. The Duke informed er. ign of what was taking place at Paris, and impressed upon him the necessity of putting himself in accord with the nation and with the Assembly. \"Is it a revolt, then?\" asked Louis XVI., with his eyes half open. \"No, Sire,\" replied"], [69, "THE CONQUERORS OF THE BASTILLE. (From the Painting by Francois Ftameng.)"], [70, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW. [The Boulevards. 54 wars : perhaps not immediately, but certainly in the future. I hear nothing of their removing from Versailles. If they stay there under the control of an armed mob, they must make a government that will please the mob ; but they will, I suppose, be wise enough to move to some central town \u2014 Tours, Blois, or Orleans, where their deliberations maybe free. But the Parisian spirit of commotion spreads rapidly ; it is here ; the troops that were near breaking my neck are employed to keep an eve on the people who show signs of an intended revolt. They have broken the windows ot some magistrates who are no favourites; and a great mob of them is at this moment assembled, demanding clamorously to have meat at five sous a pound. They have a cry among them that will conduct them to good lengths : ' Point d'impdt et vivent les e'tats/' I have spent some time at the Cabinet Litteraire reading the gazette's and journals that give an account ot the transactions at Paris ; and I have had some conversation with several sensible and intelligent men in the present revolution. The spirit of revolt is gone forth into various parts of the kingdom; the price of bread has prepared the populace everywhere for all sorts us violence ; at Lyons there have been commotions as furious as at Paris, and likewise at tt great many other I Dauphine is in arms, and Bretagne in absolute rebellion. The idea is that hunger will drive the people to revolt, and that when once they find any other means of subsistence than honest labour everything will have to be feared. Of such consequence it is to a country to have a policy on the subject of com : one that shall, by securing a high price to the farmer, encourage his culture sufficiently to secure the people from famine. I have been witness to tt scene curious to a foreigner, but dreadful to those Frenchmen who consider. Passing through the square ofthe Hotel de Ville, the mob were breaking the windows with stones, notwithstanding that an officer and a detachment of horse were on the spot. ( )bserving not only that their numbers increased, but that they grew bolder and bolder every moment, I thought it worth staying to see how the thing would end, and clambered on to the roof of a row of low stalls opposite the building against which their malice was directed. Here I could view the whole scene. Perceiving that the - would not attack them except in words and menaces they grew nu .re violent, and furiously attempted to beat the door in pieces with iron crows, placing ladders to the windows. In about a quarter of an hour, which gave time for the assembled magistrates to escape by a hack door, they burst everything open, and entered like a torrent, amid a universal shout ot triumph. From that minute a medley of casements, sashes, shutters, chairs, tables, sofas, books, papers, pictures, etc., rained down incessantly from all the windows of the house, which is seventy or eighty feet long ; this being succeeded by a shower of tiles, skirting-boards, banisters, frame-. work, and whatever parts of the building force could detach. Idle troops, both horse and hint, were quiet spectators. They were at first too few to interpo-e, and when they became more numerous the mischief was too tar advanced tu admit of any other course than that of guarding every avenue around, permitting no fresh arrivals on the scene of action, but letting everyone that pleased retire with his plunder ; guards at the same time being placed at the doors of the churches and all public buildings. I was for two hours a spectator of this scene: secure mysell from the tailing furniture, but near enough to see a fine lad of about fourteen crushed to death by some object as he was handing plunder to a woman \u2014 I suppose his mother, from the horror pictured in her countenance. I remarked several common soldiers with their white cockades . the plunderers, and instigating the mob even in sight of the officers of the detachment. Mixed in the crowd, there were people so decently dressed lhat I regarded them with no small surprise. The public archives were destroyed, and the streets for some way around strewed with papers. This was a wanton mischief, tor it will he the ruin of many families unconnected with the magistral. Although at the critical moment the first objeel of the revolutionists' attack was the Bastille, that hateful building did not, according to Mercier, inspire the common people with any peculiar indignation. It will be seen from his own words that he was in this particular a less keen-sighted i ibserver than he is generally reputed to have been. Writing just before the Revolution, Mercier saw well that his fellow-countrymen were oppressed, but believed they were too much inured to this oppression ever to rise against it. \" I have already observed,\" he writes, \"that the Parisians in general are totally indifferent SU to their political interest ; nor is this to he won dered at in a place where a man is hardly allowed to think for himself. A coercive silence, imposed upon every Frenchman from th. of his birth on whatever regards the affairs ol government, grows with him into a habit which"], [71, "THE BASTILLE ulcvards.] thinks to have travelled a great way before he reaches th le.

A o tits tor him in the streets; - into ii, desires to lie carried to a certain but unable to support the motion of the coach, he is set down, and by the assistance ot two men at length he reaches the quarter where he formerly dwelt ; but the spot is altered, and his house is no more. His wandering eye seems to interrogate every passenger, saying with heart rending accents of despondency: 'Where shall I find my wife ? Where are my children ? ' All in vain ; the oldest man hardly rememl have heard his name. At last a poor old de crepit porter is brought to him. This man had served in his family, but knew him not. Oues- I by the late prisoner, he replied, with all the indifference which accompanies the lection of events long passed, that his wife had died above thirty years before in the utmost misery, and that his children were gone into foreign countries, nothing having been heard of them for many years. Struck with grief and astonishment, the old gentleman, his eyes riveted to the ground, remains for some time motion- !\u25a0 , a. few tears would have eased his deeply wounded heart, but he could not weep. At last, recovering from his trance, he hastens to the minister to whose humanity he was in- \\ for a libertv now grown burdensome. ' Sir,' he says to him, ' send me back to my dungeon ! Who is it that can survive his friends, his relations, nay, a whole generation? Who can hear of the death of all he held dear and precious, and not wish to die? All these . which happen to other men by gradation, and one by one, have fallen upon me in an instant. Ah, sir ! it is not dreadful to die ; but it is to be last survivor.' The minister sympa thised with this truly unfortunate man. Care was taken of him, and the old porter assigned to him for his servant, as he could speak with this man of his wife and children : the only comfort now left for the aged son of sorrow, who lived some time retired, though in the midst of the noise and confusion of the capital. Nothing, how ever, could reconcile him to a world quite new for him, and to which h. resolved to remain a perfect stranger ; and friendly death at last came to his relief and closed his ev peao the fear ofthe Bastille and his natural indolence daily strengthen, till the man is totall) lost in the slave.

The figure lightly poised on the ball at the top of the column represents the Genius of Liberty. At a short distance from the Place de la Bastille, and easily accessible bv tram, is Vin cennes : known by its wood, at one time the favourite resort of duellists; by its military establishment, to which the famous Chasseurs tie Vincennes owed their name when, after the downfall of Louis Philippe, it was thought de sirable to get rid of their former designation \u2014 that of Chasseurs d'Orleans ; and for its castle, in whose ditch the ill-fated Duke d'Enghien was shot, after a mock trial, on an all but groundless accusation. The Place de la Bastille was formed in virtue of a decree of the First Consul, but it was not completed until after the establishment of the Empire. The principal ornament of the square was lo be a triumphal arch to the glory of the Grand Army. But after taking the opinion ot the Academy of Fine Arts, the emperor altered his views ; and the triumphal arch was reserved for the place it now occupies at the top of the Champs Elysees. Oddly enough, too, a massive object, intended originally for tbe spot now occupied bv the Arc de l'Etoile, was carried to the Bastille in the form of an elephant, whose trunk, according to the fantastic design, was to give forth a column of water huge enough to feed a triumphal fountain, which was inaugu rated December 2nd, 1808. The wooden model ofthe elephant, covered with plaster, was seven teen metres long and fifteen metres high, counting the tower which the animal bore on its back. Set up for a time on the western bank of the Canal de l'Ourcq, the plastered elephant was afterwards abandoned, like the project in which it played a preliminary part, anil its wooden carcase became a refuge for innumerable rats. The remains of the elephant were not removed until just before the comple tion of the bronze column which now stands in the centre of the Place de la Bastille, in memory of the victims of the Revolutions of and 1^30. The Duke d'Enghien, who, according to <mc of his biographers, had no fault hut the one common to all the Bourbons \u2014 that of being \" too easily influenced by beautiful eyes\" \u2014 was living on the German side ofthe Rhine, nearly opposite Strasburg, with his wife, a Princess de Rohan- Rochefort, to whom he had been secretly married. As a royalist and a member of tbe royal family, be was naturally the enemy of Napoleon and the Napoleonic regime. But he had taken no part in any conspiracy, unless the League 1 if Si ivereigns and States formed against Napoleon could be so considered. The duke frequently crossed over from the right or German bank, especially at Binfelden, where the Prince dc Rohan-Rochefort, his wife's father, hail taken apartments at the local inn. It became known, moreover, to the French authorities that the Prefect of Strasburg bad tor some time past been sending various agents to the German side. The princess received tit this time from an officer of the Strasburg garrison, who had been formerly attached to the Rohan family, secret intelligence that inquiries were being made in regard to the Duke d'Enghien. Soon afterwards a small body of troops a the Rhine, surrounded the little castle or Gothic villa where the duke was living at Ettenheim, seized him, and brought him over to Strasburg. He was permitted to write, and lost no time in sending a note to the princess, who, from the windows of the house, had followed in painful anxiety all the events of the alarming drama acted before her eves. d'be first stone of this monument was laid by King I ouis Philippe on the 27th of July, 1831.

The first letters written by the young man fr< mt Strasburg to his wife (they are still preserved in tbe- French Archives) showed no apprehension of danger ; nothing could be proved against him except what was known beforehand, that he was a Bourbon and tin enemy of Napoleon. \"As far as I remember,\" wrote the duke to his wife, \"they will find letters from my relations and from tbe king, together with copies of some of mine.

It was as follows : \u2014 \"After the death of the Princess Char lotte, there was found among her papers a sealed packet, of which the superscription directed that it should be opened by the President of wnicn v mcennes, or rather the wood of Vincennes, has fri un time to time been the scene. Duels in France are generally fought with swords ; and as it depends upon the combatants to strike or not to strike at a mortal part, a hostile meeting is by no means al ways attended with serious consequen ces. It is a mistake, however, to assume, as Englishmen fre quently do, that a duel in France fought for grave reasons is not itself a grave affair. Plenty of sword duels have placed the worsted combatant in im minent danger of his life ; though it is undeniable that the pistol, being a m >re hazardous weapon, proves, as a rule, ADRIENNE LKCOUVREUR.

Armand Carrel conceived that he was justified in regarding the course adopted by M. de Girar dm as indicating an intention to bring the matter to a duel, and on his suggesting as much, M. de Girardin replied, \" A duel with such a man as you, sir, would be quite a bonne fortune.\" \" Sir,\" replied Carrel, \" I can never regard a duel as a bonne fortune.\" A few moments after wards M. Lautour-Mezeray arrived. Hispresence served to give the discussion a more conciliatory tone, and it was ultimately agreed that a few words of explanation should be published in both journals. On M. de Girardin's proposing to draw up the note at once, \" You may rely upon me, sir,\" said Armand Carrel, with dig nity. The quarrel seemed almost at an end ; but an incident reanimated it. M. de Girardin required that the publication of the note should take place simultaneously in the two journals. Carrel, on the contrary, held that it ought to appear first in the f^esse, Girardin's paper; but he experienced on this point the most deter mined resistance. It was then that, carried away with indignation, wounded to the quick, utterly unable to adhere any longer to the moderation which, by a determined effort, he had hitherto enforce;! upon himself, Carrel rose and exclaimed, \"I am the offended person ; I choose the pistol !\" It was early on the morning of Friday, July 22, 1836, that Armand Carrel and M. de Girar din found themselves face to face in the Bois de Vincennes. While the pistols were being loaded, Carrel said to M. de Girardin, \" Should chance be against me and you should afterwards write my life, you will, in all honour, adhere strictly and simply to the facts ? \" \" Rest assured,\" replied his adversary. The seconds had measured a distance of'forty paces ; the combatants were to advance within twenty of each other. Armand Carrel immediately took his place and advanced, presenting, despite the urgent entreaties ot M. Ambert that he would show less front, the whole breadth of his person to his adversary's aim. M. de Girardin having also advanced some paces, both parties fired nearly at th' instant, and both fell wounded, the one in the leg, the other in the groin. \" I saw him,\" wrote Louis Blanc some time as erwards, \" as he lay ; his pale features express ing passion in repose. His attitude was firm, inflexible, martial, like that of a soldier who slumbers on the eve of battle.\" tunate Armand Carrel, one of the boldest and most brilliant writers that the Republican Press of France possessed. Armand Carrel and his antagonist, Emile de Girardin, another famous journalist of Louis Philippe's reign, fought with pistols in that Bois de Vincennes whose name at once suggests crossed rapiers or whizzing bullets. M. de Girardin was the inventor of the cheap pies-, not only in France, but in Europe. To reduce the price of the newspaper, and thus increase the number of subscribers, while cover ing any possible loss on the sale by the en larged revenue from advertisements, which would flow in more and more rapidly as the cir culation widened : such was Girardin's plan. According, however, to his enemies, he proposed to \"enlarge the portion hitherto allotted in newspapers to mendacious announcements to the self-commendations of quackery and imposture, at the sacrifice of space which should be devoted to philosophy, history, literature, the arts, and whatever else elevates or delights the mind of man.\" The proposed change was really one which Democrats and Republicans should have hailed with delight ; for it promised to extend a knowledge of public affairs to readers who had hitherto been prevented from becoming ac quainted with them by the high price of the newspapers, which, apart from their own articles on political affairs, published long accounts of the debates in the Chamber. M. de Girardin, however, found his inno vation attacked as the device of a charlatan. He was accused of converting journalism into the most sordid of trades: of making it \"a speaking-trumpet of the money-grabber and the speculator.\" Some of M. de Girardin's opponents went so far as to hint that he was not working in good faith, and that the losses to which the diminution of price must expose his journal were to be made good by a secret subsidy. Armand Carrel, as editor of the National, en tered into the quarrel, and took part against Girardin, who, on his side, wrote a bitter attack upon Carrel. No sooner bad Carrel read the scathing article than he called upon its author, demanding either retractation or personal satis faction. He entered Girardin's room, accom panied by M. Adolphe Thibaudeau, holding open in his hand the journal which contained the offensive lines. Girardin asked Carrel to wait until he also could have a friend present. M. Lautour-Mezeray was sent for ; but pending"], [79, "DUELLING. 63 The Boulevards.) M. de Girardin was profoundly grieved at the result of the duel, and he made a vow never to fight again. Many years afterwards, under the Republic of 1848, he visited the grave of the man he had killed, to express bis regret and ask for pardon in the name of tbe form of Government to which be had now become a convert, and which Carrel had always placed above every other. the \" Corsican Brothers.\" At last he noticed a little speck of white in his adversary's ear : simply a small piece of cotton-wool. \" I will hit him in the ear,\" said Dumas to himself ; and on his confiding the amiable intention to one of his seconds, the latter promised to watch carefully the effect of the shot, inasmuch as he was anxious to see whether a man hit with a bullet through the head turned round a little bc-fi ire falling or fell straight to the ground. Dumas's pistol, however, missed fire. The delightful ex periment contemplated could not, therefore, be tried ; and the encounter was bloodless. The duelling chronicles of the Bois de Vin cennes would lead us far away from the Paris of to-day. It may be mentioned, however, that in this wood Alexandre Dumas the elder fought his famous duel with a collaborateur, who claimed to have written the whole of the Tour dc Nesle, and who, undoubtedly, supplied to the skilful dramatist the framework of the piece. At \\ nicennes was confined for a few days, just before his expulsion from France, the Young Pretender, or \" Charles Edward,\" as the French called him. The Duke de Biron had been ordered to see to his arrest ; and one evening wnen it was known that he intended to visit the Opera, Biron surrounded the building with twelve hundred guards as soon as the prince had entered it. He was arrestetl, taken to Vincennes, and kept there tour days ; then to be liberated and expelled from France, in accordance with the treaty of 174s, so humiliating to the French arms. The servants of the Young Pretender, and with them one of the retinue of the Princess de Talmont, whose antiquated charms had detained him at Paris, were conveyed to the Bastille ; upon which the princess wrote the following letter to M. de Maurepas, the minister: \"The king, sir, has just covered himself with im mortal glory by arresting Prince Edward. I have no doubt but that his Majesty will order a Te Dctini to be sung to thank God for so brilliant a victory. But as Placide, my lacquey, taken captive in this memorable expedition, can add nothing to his Majesty's laurels, I bi to send him back to me.\" \"The only English man the regiment of French guards has taken throughout the war ! \" exclaimed the Prino Conti, when she heard ofthe arrest. Dumas was in all truth a skilful dramatist. though one may hesitate to give him the title of dramatic poet, which he loved to claim. \" What are you ? \" said the judge of the Rouen Tribunal to the author of so many clever pieces, who had to give evidence in a certain case. \" If I were not in the city of Corneille,\" answered Alexander the Great, \"I should call myself a dramatic poet.\" \"There are degrees in everything,\" re plied the judge. Alexandre Dumas was, all the same, a great inventor, and he possessed an extraordinary talent for putting dramatic things into shape. When, therefore, the future editor of the Courier des Etats-Unis claimed to have written all that was important in the Tour de . he doubtless declared what from a literary point ot view was false. Dumas not only re jected his contention, but declined to allow his own name to appear in the bill side by side with that of his collaborateur. Hence angry words and a duel : once more a serious one, and with pistols, not swords. With a calm desire to kill his man, of which, were he not his own accuser, one would refuse to suspect him, Dumas tells us, in his Memoirs, when he appeared on the ground, he ex amined his adversary's costume, and, while thinking it excellent as a \"make-up,\" was sorry to find that it offered no salient mark for a pistol-shot. M. Gaill. inlet was dressed entirely in black ; his trousers, bis buttoned-up coat, his were all as inky as Hamlet's cloak, and ling to tbe Parisian fashion of the time, he wore no shirt-collar. \" Impossible to see the man,\" said Dumas to himself; \"there is no point about him to aim at.\" He at the same time made a mental note of the costume, which he afterwards reproduced in the duel scene of \"Besides the Bastille and the Castle of Vin cennes, which are the privileged places of con finement for State prisoners, there are others,\" says an old chronicler, \" which may be called the last strongholds of tyranny.

Of this abode the royal favourite duly took possession. Charles was by no means popular with his subjects, whom he taxed severely ; and they were scandalised by the way in which Agnes Sorel squandered money, by her undisguised relations with the king, and by the kindness with which she was apparently treated even by the queen.

LET us return now from Vincennes to the _y Place de la Bastille and the Boulevard Beaumarchais. Perhaps the most interesting house on this boulevard is number twenty-three, which was built by Mansard, the famous architect, for his own occupation. One set of rooms in the house was occupied by the celebrated Ninon de Lenclos, who died there October 17, 1703, at the age of eighty-nine, preserving, according to tradition, her remarkable beauty to tbe very la-t. Here Voltaire, then in his twelfth year, was presented to her ; nor did she forget to assign to him in her will 2,000 francs for the purchase of books. Xext door to the house ot Mansard and Ninon de Lenclos is the little Beaumarchais theatre, which, constructed in forty-three days, was opened on the 3rd of December, 1835, under the style ot Theitre de la Porte St. -Antoine. In 1S42 it was re-named Theatre Beaumarchais. Then at different periods it bore the titles of Opera Pousse l-rainai-, ami Fantaisies Parisiennes, until at length, in [888, when it was entirely rebuilt, it became once more the Theatre Beaumarchais. The Government of 1X30 did right in giving tlie name of Beaumarchais to the boulevard on which he at one time lived, and where he possessed a certain amount of property. During the stormy years that immediately preceded the Revolution of 1789 Beaumarchais was an im portant figure ; and the effect of the \" Marriage tro\" on the public mind was in a good ire to prepare it for the general overthrow then imminent. The King, the Queen, the Ministers, were all, in the first instance, afraid of the \" Marriage of Figaro \" ; and we have seen that to get it produced Beaumarchais displayed a- much diplomacy and energy a- would suffice in the present day to upset a Cabinet. While living at hi- mansion near the Porte St. -Antoine, Beaumarchais built close at hand the Theitre du Marais, where, after letting it to a manager, he brought out, in I7'i2, his \" Mere Coupable \" \u2014 the third part of hi- Figaro liilogy, in which the Count and Countess Almaviva, Figaro and Susannah, are shown in their old age. The \"guilty mother\" is the Countess herself; the charming and, as one had hoped, innocent Rosina of the \"Barber of Seville.\" Tbe male offender is Chciubin, better known under bis operatic name ot Cherubino, who after saying in the French comedy, with a mixture of timidity and audacity, \"Si j'osais o er I \" ends by daring too much. \" La Mere Coupable\" obtained but little success, and de served none. Closed by Imperial order in 1807, the Theatre du Marais existed only for fifteen years. It must not be confounded with the ancient theatre of tbe same name where in 1636 Corneille produced his famous tragedy \" J.e Cid.\" The Marais or marsh, whose name recalls the early history of Paris, when Lutetia was de fended by marshes as by a broad impassable moat, has long been known as the favourite abode of small pensioners and fundholders, who in this remote quarter found food and - at inexpensive rate-. The Marais, however, has had, like most other parts of Paris, its illustrious residents ; and when about the middle of the eighteenth century the immortal actress Mile. Clairon lived there she was the third famous inmate of the tenement in which she bad taken up her abode. \" I was told of a small house in the Rue du Marais,\" she writes in her memoirs, \"which I could have for two hundred francs, where Racine was said to have lived forty years with his family. I was informed that it was there he had composed his imperishable works and there that he died ; and that afterwards it had been occupied by the tender Lecouvreur, who had ended her days in it. ' The walls ofthe house,' I reflected, ' will be alone sufficient to make me feel the sublimity of the- author and develop the talents of the actress. In this sanctuary then I will live and die !

Begun by Diana of France, legitimatised daugh ter of Henri II., the Hotel Lamoignon was bought and finished in 1581 for Charles de Valois, Duke of Angouleme, natural son of Charles IX., who, according to Tallemant des Reaux, would have been \"tbe best fellow in the world if he could only have got rid of his swindling propensities.\" When his servants ti-ke-d him for money, he would reply to them : \"My house has three outlets into the street; take whichever of them you like best.\" The architecture of the Hotel Lamoignon is that of that a splinter from Montgomery's lance pene trated the king's eye through the broken of his helmet.

It was replaced after the Restoration, under the reign of Charles X., by the present statue. and the had air he breathed may well have been the cause. The life of Louis XVII., from the departure of the Simons until his death, can be made out continuously; and the evidence of his having died in the Temple is quite conclusive. Never. theless, Louis XVIII., in view of the pretension constantly springing up, instituted for his own satisfaction an inquiry into the whole matter ; and the proofs adduced in the course of it as to the identity ofthe \"child in the Temple\" with the son of Louis XYI. and Marie Antoinette seem decisive. Idle Boulevard du Temple owes its name to a building which was first occupied by the Order of Templars, and which, towards the close ol the last century, enjoyed a sad celebrity as the prison where Louis X\\T., Marie Antoinette, and the voting Dauphin were confined. No less than forty-eight works tire said to have been written on the imprisonment of Louis XVII., and matters connected with it, including the histories of some dozen \"claim ants,\" asserting, in his name, their right to the French throne. Most of these pretenders, with Naundorff \u2014 who had been the Dauphin's valet in the Temple \u2014 prominent among them, had no difficulty in finding enthusiasts ami dupes to further their designs ; and even in France one of them caused himself to be described on his tombstone as \" Louis de France.\" The Emperor Napoleon III. took, however, the liberty of ordering the inscription to be effaced. M. Nauroy, however, author of \"Les Secrets ties Bourbons,\" is convinced that the true Louis XVII. was carried out of the Temple in a bundle of linen, and that by like means the child who ultimately died there was substituted for him. M. Nauroy finds in support of his belief abund ant evidence, positive and negative, which he derives from a variety of sources, and sometimes discovers in the most unexpected places. The appearance of a long succession of im postors claiming to be Louis XVII. proves nothing, and will pass for what it is worth in the native land of Arthur Orton. It is remark able, however, that Royalists and Republicans, including eminent personages on both side-, have agreed in maintaining that the child wh.. died in the Temple was not Louis XVII, Louis Blanc favours this view in his \" History of the Revolution.\" Nor does he do so without taking a calm, judicial survey of all the evidence 111 the ease. He may consciously or uncon sciously have been influenced bv party spirit ; and the moral he draws from the whole matter is that there is danger in tbe principle of \"divine right \" when, through a variety of acci dents, it may be impossible to show 011 whom this questionable right has devolved. Soon after tbe death of the Count de Cham- Inn d, M. tie Chantelauze published in the Illus tration an account of Louis XVH.'s life in the Temple, and of his last illness, death, and post mortem examination, together with certificates which have no doubt as to the young prince having really died in bis prison. Simon, the gaoler, according to M. de Chantelauze's view, was, like so many other bad men, not wholly bad ; while his wife was for the most part good, the appearance of badness or roughness which she manifested when the child confided to her care was visited by members of the Commune being assumed in order to inspire her employers with confidence. Hie task assigned to Simon wa- not, as has often been supposed, to reduce the young prince, by ill-treatment, to such a point that he would at hist be attacked by illness and carried off, but simply to get from him evidence' against his mother, the Queen, with respect to her complicity in the Ware-lines plot, and the various plans formed for effecting the escape of the child. The evidence having been obtained by the simple process of first putting it into the child's mouth, and afterwards taking it out, the special work assigned to the Simons was at an end, and the young prince experienced from them nothing but kindness. If he ultimately fell ill and died, his confinement Those Royalists who deny that Louis XVII. died in the Temple, explain the announcement of his death and the proclamation of Louis XVIII. in the Royalist camp, first, by the incon venience of bringing forward as King of France a child of tender years ; secondly, by the diffi culty of producing this child ; and, thirdly, by thedanger, when Louis XVIII. had once . acceptance with the party, of dividing it by a revelation of the fact that his nephew, son of Louis XVI., was still alive.

IN THE PLACE DES VOSGES. eighteenth Louis was ten years old when the child of the Temple is supposed to have died in prison ; and according to the most convinced, not to say credulous, of those writers who maintain that Louis XVII. escaped, to live for years afterwards, he breathed his last in 1872 at Saveney (Loire Inferieure), under the name of Laroche, at the age of eighty-seven. The numerous impostors who with more or less success personated the unhappy prince had died much earlier. But the descendants of Xamidorff, his valet, the most famous of all these pretenders, claim still to be of the blood royal, and on the occasion of the Count de Chambord's death they displayed a proud con sciousness of their rights by publishing some where in Holland a manifesto asserting gravely the title of the chief of the family to the throne of France. Another prisoner in the Temple of whom At that time there were, as M. Nauroy sets forth, only four persons in the Temple \u2014 the Dauphin, Simon, his wife, and the Princess Elizabeth, afterwards Duchcs., of Angouleme. Simon died mi the scaffold six months after- . on the J.Sth of July. The Princess Elizabeth, confined in a room apart from her brother, never saw him again, and consequently knew nothing of him except by hearsay. From January loth to July 28th there was no warder at the Temple. The child was watched by Commissaries, who were relieved from day to day, and of whom not one could establish his identity. When regular gaolers were appointed, :ie of them had ever seen the Dauphin.

In 1785 the Astleys, father and son, came to Paris and there opened a circus exactly like the one they had just founded in London. Under their direction this theatre, situated at number twenty-four Rue du Fau bourg du Temple, and measuring twenty metres in diameter, was lighted by 2,000 lamps and furnished with two rows of boxes. The price ol the seats varied from twelve sou- to three francs.

The tricks of the circus, how mi familiar, that in England, at least, no one care, to see them, were at that time new, and the sight of a man attitudinising on the back of a horse at full gallop excited the greatest wonder. Locke, it is true, was a metaphysician, and had nothing whatever to do with diplomacy. But his friend Montesquieu was a personage of political importance, and in. his anxiety tei assist French artists in London he even went so far as to bring to their performance, a, many of the English nobility as were willing to attend. About the same time, at the sug gestion of the Regent of Orleans, a Minister of State, M. de Maurepas, made overtures to Handel concerning a series ot representations which it was proposed that his celebrated company should give at the Academie Royale of Paris. M. de Maurepas wished, like .Mr. Washburne at a later day, to secure for ban, the best available talent ; and he looked to Handel's opera-house for singers, as Mr. Wash burne looked to the circuses of the United States for \" bare-back riders.\" Astlev's Circus in Paris possessed, as so many operatic theatres have done, a sort of inter national character. Engagements were made for it bv diplomatists abroad. It can be shown, indeed, that diplomatists have long ami almost from time immemorial been in the habit of doing agency work for artists and managers of good position. Operatic celebrities have been particularly favoured in this respect. A great Minister of State, Cardinal Mazarin, introduced, or aided powerfully in introducing, opera into France. The engagement ol Cambert as director of music at the Court of Charles II. was effected by diplomatic means. Gluck, more than a century later, wa, induced to visit Paris through the representations ofa secretary of the French Embassy at Vienna\u2014 that M. du Rollet who arranged for Gluck, on the basis ot Racine's Tphigenie, tbe libretto of Tphigenie en Auli'dc ; ami Piccini, at the instigation of Madame .lo Barry, was secured at Paris a, opposition com poser through the instrumentality of Baron de Breteuil, French Ambassador at Rome, working operation with the Marquis Carraccioli, Neapolitan Ambassador at Paris. < )n this subject Ebers's \" Seven Years of the King's Theatre\" shows that immediately after the peace of 1815 all the offers of engagements to artists of the Paris opera were made through the medium of the English Embassy to the Court of France, or by special missions with which diplomatists of distinction were glad to he entrusted. The committee of noblemen who aided Ebers in his management treated, through the English Ambassador at Paris, with the Director of the Academy, or with the Minister ot Fine Arts ; though, as a matter of fact, they tailed to secure by these elaborate means the sen ici ol artists who, in the present day, would be engaged through an exchange of telegrams. The outbreak of the Revolution was the signal for the Astleys and their company to recross tlie Channel, anil the Astley Circus remained un occupied until 1791. Then a company calling themselves \"The Comedians without a Title The great Montesquieu, moreover, when he w.n in England, had not thought it unbecoming to interest himself in the welfare of the French artists who occasionally arrived in England with recommendations addressed to him. Nor did the illustrious Locke occupy himself so exclu sively with the \"human understanding\" as to have no time to bestow on the material interests of foreign danseuses. Locke was not indeed one of those practically Epicurean philosophers of whom M.

The . which in the old building was an accessory, became in the new one of the first importance. It was now possible to perform military ma n\u0153uvres On a large scale. At the restored circus presented during the last years of the of Charles X. the Siege of Saragossa ; and under Louis Philippe a number of military pieces founded on incidents in the history of the Republic and the Empire. had a considerable effect in producing, or at least hastening, the long series of military defeats to which France was subjected in the war of [87c. The news of victories gained in Africa was, all the same, constantly reaching France ; and each successive triumph was made the subject of a new dramatic spectacle at the circus or hippo drome. Abd-el-Kader became a familiar theatri cal figure, and his famous interview with General Bugeaud was represented in more than one eques tiian piece. Abd-el-Kader had by the most violent means been prevailed upon to make peace ; and an interview was arranged at which the Arab chief and Bugeaud, the French com mander, were to ratify it by a personal inter change of promises. Abd-el-Kader did not, however, keep his appointment, and seems, indeed, to have studiously missed it. ddie French general, in a fit of impatience, left his room, and went forward with a small escort, military and civil, towards the quarters of the unpunctual Arab chief, in order to stir him up. On reaching the advanced posts, the French general called a chieftain of one of the tribes, who pointed out to him the bill-side where the emir lav encamped. \" It is unbecoming of your chief,\" said Bugeaud to this Arab, \" to bring me so tar, and then make me wait so long;\"' whereupon he continued resolutely to advance. The emir's escort now appeared. Ihe Arab chieftains, most ol them young ami handsome, were magnificently mounted, and made a gallant display of their finery. Presently from their ranks a horseman advanced dressed in a coarse burnoose, with a camel-hair cord, and without any outward sign of distinction, except that his black horse, which he sat most elegantly, was surrounded by Arabs holding the bridle and the stirrups. This was Abd-el-Kader. The French general held out his hand ; the other grasped it twice, then threw himself quickly from his horse, and sat down. General Bugeaud took his place beside him, and the conversation began. Idle emir was of small stature; bis face serious and pale, with delicate features slightly marked by time, and a keen sparkling eye. His hands, which were beautifully formed, played with a chaplet that hung round his neck. He spoke gently, but there was on his lips and in the expression of countenance a certain affectation of disdain. The conversation turned, of course, upon the peace which bad just been concluded, ami Abd-el-Kader spoke of the cessation 't hostilities with elaborate and feigned iniliffcr- Every Government in France since the first Napoleon bas bail victories of its own, impor tant or unimportant, to celebrate. The martial triumphs of Louis XIV. seem, by common nt, to have been forgotten, either because h history dates for the immense majority of the population from the time of the Revo lution, or because the battles won under the old Monarchy are now too remote to stir the national pride.

Under tbe Restor ation a campaign was undertaken in Spain, the incidents of which so lent themselves to dramatic 1 nt that playwrights reproduced them on tge and in the arena of tbe circus.

It was in Africa, however, and in the neighbourhood of Algiers, that Louis Philippe's army played for many so active a part. ddie war against the Dey of Algiers was begun by Charles X., whose consul bad been insulted by that potentate ; Philippe continued it, chiefly, it was lit, in order to keep open for discon tented spirits a field of activity at a safe dis tance from France.

Since, indeed, tbe murder of Henri III. by Jacques Clement, it has been the rule, rather than the exception, with royal personag France to be struck by the assassin or the execu tioner ; or, if spared in body, to be brought all the same to some tragic end. Henri IV. fell by the hand of Ravaillac. No such fate awaited Louis XIII., Henri IV.

What, it may be asked, had a quiet, peaceful, and eminently respectable monarch like Louis Philippe done to provoke repeated attempts upon his life? The explana tion is simple. Charles X. had been driven away in 1830 by the Republicans, not that another king might be appointed in his stead, hut that the Republic might be established. Louis Philippe was, from their point of view, an interloper who must, at till hazards, be removed. Fieschi's experiment with his infernal machine created a sensation all over Europe ; ami 'he papers for some time afterwards were full oi particulars, more or less authentic, of the dia bolical attempt upon King Louis Philippi The Revolutionists, whose action against Charles X. had led to the establishment, no: Republic, but of a Monarchy\u2014 hateful to them in whatever form \u2014 had evidently sworn that h\u00ab should die. It was ascertained by M. Thiers, ence. When the French general, after pointing out to him that the treaty could not be put into force until it was ratified, observed that the truce, meanwhile, was favourable to the Arabs, since it would save their crops from destruction so long a- it lasted, the chief replied: \"You may destroy the crops this moment, and I will give you a written authority to tio so, it you like. Tbe Arabs are not in want ot corn.\" The conversation at an end, General Bugeaud Stood up. and the emir remained seated ; where upon the former, stung to the quick, seized the emir's hand and jerked it, saying \"Come', get up.\" The French were delighted at this charac teristic act of an imperious and intrepid nature, und the Arabs could not conceal their aston ishment. As for the emir, seized with an involuntary confusion, he turned round without uttering a word, sprang on his horse and rode back to bis own people ; his return being a signal for enthusiastic cries of \"God preserve the Sultan '. \" which echoed from hill to hill. A violent thunder-burst added to the effect of this strange scene, and the Arabs vanished among the mountain gorges. Until [860 the Boulevard du Temple was noted for a number of little theatres, where marionettes might be seen dancing on the tight-rope, or where pantomimes in the Italian Style were performed. Then there was the cabinet of wax figures, together with other little shows, difficult to class: all destined in that year to disappear. The reconstruction of this portion of Paris caused the removal of many theatres, which were built again at other points. The site of the former circus was now- occupied by tbe Imperial Theatre of the Chatelet. The eirciis reappeared, for winter performances, in the Boulevard des Filles de Calvaire, for tin summer season in the Champs Elysees. In connection with the winter circus the Popular Concerts started by the late Pasdeloup must not be forgotten. Here the finest symphonic music of the French and other composers, chiefly modern, was performed in admirable style. Here tbe French public were familiarised with the works of Berlioz, and, in spite of a certain opposition at the outset, with selections from si me of the operas of Wagner.

Along the whole line which he traversed there prevailed a dead silence, broken only at inter vals by the ex qfficio acclamations ofthe soldiers. At a few minutes past twelve the royal cortege arrived in front ol the Eighth Legion, which was stationed along the Boulevard du Temple. Here, near the end of the Jardin Turc, as the King was leaning forward to receive a petition from the hands of a National Guardsman, a sound was heard like the fire ot a well-sustained platoon. In an instant the ground was strewn with the dead and dying. Marshal Mortier and General -se de Verigny, wounded in the head, fell bathed in their blood. A young captain of Artillery, M. de Villate, slid from his horse, his arms extended at full length, as though they had been nailed to a cross ; he had been shot in the head, and expired ere he touched tbe ground.

Other attempts had been made and were still to be made on the life of Louis Philippe. The ferocious exploit, however, of Fieschi remains the most notorious one of this reign. At last the Citizen King lost bis nerve; and in February, [848, disappeared in face of a danger not more formidable, if firmly met at the outset, than the one which he had despised thirteen years previously, in 1835. Fieschi was found, on inquiry, to have lodged in tbe house for several months. He stated himself to be a machinist. The porter had never been inside Fieschi's room since he had occupied it. There had been but one man to ieschi, whom he represented as h., uncle, and three women, who, he said, were his mistresses. On the morning of the 2*th he had been noticed to go in and out, up and down, in a visible state of agitation, and once, though habitually abstemious, he went into a neighbouring cafe to drink a glass of brandy. At the military post where he was taken upon lest, a National Guard having asked him who he was, \" What's that to you ? \" be replied, \" I shall answer such questions when they are put by tbe proper people.\" Some gunpowder having been found upon his person, he was a ked what it was for. \"For glory!\" he exclaimed. Fieschi was simply guillotined ; and he was the first regicide or would-be regicide in France who escaped torture. The horrible cruelties inflicted on the assassins of French kings may make many persons less sensitive than they otherwise would be to the misfortunes reserved for the successors of these princes. The only possible excuse for the diabolical punishments devised for regicides under the old French Monarchy is that such barbarity was of the age. The torture of Damiens was imitated in every detail from the torture of Ravaillac, which had for precedent the torture of Gerard, the assassin of the Prince of Orange. An ingenious French writer attempted to decide whether Ravaillac's torments were greater than those of Gerard. It is certain in any ca^e that the latter suffered with much greater constancy. Ravaillac shrieked out in a terrible manner, whereas Balthasar Gerard never uttered a groan. The trial of Fieschi and his accomplices took on the 30th of January, 1836, before the of Peers assembled in the palace ot the nig. In tbe body of the court, in if the clerk's table, were displayed, among gainst the prisoners, a machine imber of guns in an inclined .n, an extinguished firebrand, a dag ith a quantity of bullets in it, an iron gauntlet, and a bloodstained n In this connection it is curious that, from the middle of the eighteenth century until the time of the French Revolution, the name of Damiens, or Damian, at present venerated throughout the civilised world, was in France, its country of origin, one of such opprobrium that nobody ventured to bear it. No French man, indeed, would have dared to do so ; for after the attempt upon the life of Louis XV. the name of Damiens, or D' Amiens, his would-be murderer, with all names of similar sound or spelling were, by a special edict, ab solutely proscribed. To go by the name of D'Amiens, Damiens, or Damian, was to proclaim oneself affiliated nearly or remotely to the ikable being \u2014 the regicide, the parricide \u2014 who had lifted his hand against tbe Lord's anointed.

Paris i- celebrated above all the capitals of Europe for its cafes; and the beverage which gives it- name to these establishments seems to have been known earlier in France than in any other European country. Coffee was intro duced into central Europe in 1683, the year of the battle of Vienna ; and from the Austrian capital the use of coffee spread rapidly to all parts of Germany. The circumstances under which the Austrians first became acquainted with it were somewhat curious. The Turks had brought with them to Vienna an imposing siege train. No European power possessed such formidable artillery; and their -tone ball- of sixty pounds each were not only tbe largest projectiles ever tired, but were irded as the largest which by any possible means could he tired. According to the inge nious, but incorrect, view of one of Sobieski 's graphers (the Abbe Coyer), the amount of powder requisite for the discharge of a missile of greater weight would be so enormous as not to give time for the- whole of it to become ignited before tbe ball left the cannon. Kara Mustapha, the Turkish general, had also bn night with him a number of archers ; and when a letter from Sobieski to the Duke of Lorraine was intercepted by a Turkish patrol, the docu ment was attached to an arrow and shot into the town, accompanied by a note in the Latin language to the effect that all further resistance was out of the question, and that the Vienna garrison had now nothing to do but accept its tate. The Turks, moreover, brought to Vienna an immense number of women, whose throat-, when the Turkish army was forced to retire in headlong flight, they unscrupulously cut. The stone cannon balls of prddigious weight, the arrows, and the women could all be accounted for. But the Turks left behind them a large number of bags containing white berries, of which nothing could be made. ( If these berries, however, after duly roasting and pound. ing them, an Austrian soldier, who had been a prisoner in Turkey, made coffee ; and as he had distinguished himself during the battle, the Emperor granted him permission to open a simp in Vienna for the sale of the Turkish beverage which he had learned under such interesting circumstances to prepare. According to another less authentic anecdote, the use of tbe mysterious white berries found among the stores of the defeated Turks was first pointed out by a Turkish soldier who had been working in the trenches before the be sieged city, and had so fatigued himself bv his ceaseless toil, that he fell asleep and shun. he-red on througlrdut the whole of the battle, undisturbed by the cavalry charges, the mus ketry fire, and the explosions of the artillery with its terrible sixty-pounders. When at hist, after sleep had done its restorative work, the exhausted soldier woke up to find himself in the hands of the Christians, be was terribly alarmed. But his life was spared, and in return for this clemency on the part ot his enemies he taught them how to make Ci iffee. Parisians, however, pride themselves on having known coffee fourteen years earlier than the Viennese. It is said, indeed, that an enter prising Levantine started a coffee-house at Paris in the very middle of tbe seventeenth century, and not later than the year 1650. The na the stimulating beverage that he offered sot sale was, as be wrote it, ca hone. But the un happy man had not taken the necessary steps for getting his new importation spok beforehand in good society ; and, no one know mo what to make of the strange liquor he wished to dispense \u2014 hot, black, and bitter \u2014 the founder of the first coffee-house or cafe became bankrupt. The French, however, during the seventeenth and eighteenth' centuries were sworn frie-mh of tbe Turks, whose power they played oil or every occasion against that of tbe bated Empire. Vienna might, indeed, on two occasions nave been captured, plundered, and burnt bv the infidels for all France cared to tio towards saving it. France, mi her side, was viewed with favour by the Turks ; and in ibbg an ambas Soliman Aga by name, was sent by the Porte on a mission to Louis XIV., at who-' he made known the virtues of tbe berry which"], [101, "PARISIAN CAFES. 83 I ulevards.] long previously the Arabs had introduced throughout the East. The writer then proceeds to lament the absence of sociability at the coffee-house, and the gloomy countenances of its frequenters, as contrasted with the convivial faces of those \"brave ancestors\" of his generation who used t\" pass their leisure, not at coffee-houses, but at taverns. One cause of the difference he finds in the change of beverage. \" Our forefathers,\" he explains, \" drank that mirth-inspiring liquor with which Burgundy and Champaign supplied them. This gave life to their meetings. Ours are more sober, no doubt, but is this sobriety the companion of health? By it\" means. For generous wine we have substituted a black beverage, bad in itself, but worse by the man ner in which it is made in all the coffee houses of this fashionable metropolis. The good Parisians, however, are very careless in the matter; they drink off whatever is put before them, ami swallow this baneful wash, which in its turn is driven down by more deadly poisons, mistakenly called cordials.\" Properly presented, coffee met in Paris with a success which elsewhere it had failed to attain, and before long it became the rage in fashionable society. When it was at the height of its first popularity, however. Madame de Sevigne condemned it, saying that the taste tor coffee, like the taste for Racine, would pass away. Racine, in spite of the beauty of his at once tender and epigrammatic lines, is not much read in the present day, and is scarcely ever acted. Coffee, on the other hand, is as popular now as ill the days when Pope wrote iuplet on \" Coffee, which makes the politician wise, Ami see through all things with his half-shut eyes.\" \"There are in this capital,\" wrote the author of the \" Tableau de Paris \" more than a hundred ago, \"between six and seven hundred coffee-houses, the common refuge of idleness and poverty, where the latter is warmed without any expense for fuel, and the former entertained by a view of the crowds who make their entrance and exit by turns. In other countries, where liberty is more than an empty name, a coffee house is the rendez-vous of politicians who freely - the conduct of the Minister, or debate on matters of State. Not s<j here! I have already given a very good reason why the Parisians are sparing of their political reflections. If they speak at all on State matters it is to extol the (lower of their sovereign, and the wisdom of his counsellors. .V half-starved author, with all his wardrobe and movables on his 'back, dining at these restaurants on a dish of coffee and a halfpenny roll, talks big of the immen ol France, and the abundance she offers of every necessary of life ; whilst hi only supper is the steam arising from the rich man's kitchen, as he returns to his empty garret.\" Since tbe above was written, coffee, far from living out, has become more and more popular, and musical cafes, theatrical cafes, and literary cafes have been everywhere established in Paris. There are financial cafes, too, chiefly, of course, in the region ofthe Bourse; and among the cafes bv which the Bourse is partly surrounded used to be one which owed its notoriety to the fact that Fieschi's mistress \u2014 in the character of \"dame du coniptoir \" \u2014 was exhibited there to the public. Two days after the execution of the would- be regicide and actual maker of the famous infernal machine, a crowd of people might have been seen struggling towards the doors of a cafe on the Place de la Bourse, which was already as full as it could hold. \"Those,\" says an eye-witness, \"who performed the feat lining admission, saw, gravely seated at a counter, adorned with costly draperies, an ordinary-looking woman, blind of one eve, and sing in tact no external merit but that of youth.

In Paris, however, as in London, theatres have often the reputation of being unlucky when, to succeed, all they require is a good piece with good actors to play in it.

This theatre was started in 1830 by M. Alaux, previously manager of the Dramatic Parnassus on the Boulevard du Temple. It was opened on January 22nd, 1831, under the direction of M. Leopold, who produced at this house a long series of success ful pieces. Among these may be mentioned \"Robert Macaire \" with Frederic Lemaitre in tbe leading part. When, amidst demoli tions and reconstructions, the original Folies Dramatiques came down, the company was transferred to the new building which now stands in the Rue de Bondi. Here were brought out Hcrve's \" \u0152il Creve \" and \"Petit Faust,\" Lecoq's \"Fille de Madame Angot,\" Planquette's \" Cloches de Corneville,\" and other works which were soon to become known all over Europe.

The new house established in the Porte Saint- Martin was opened tog days after the destruc tion of the Opera House ill the Rue Saint- Honore. Here were brought out the \" \u0152dipus Coloneus \" of Sacchini, the \" Daniades \" and other works of Salieri, the \"Demophon\" of Cherubini, the \"Re Teodoro \" of Paisiello, and a French version of Mozart's \"Marriage oi Figaro.\" Many of the operas of Sacchini, Salieri, and Cherubini were composed specially for the French theatre. Paisiello's and Mozart's works were, of course, produced in translations. Mo zart's \" Marriage of Figaro \" was brought out in the middle of the Reign of Terror, March :o, 17Q3. Meanwhile, doubts had always been enter tained as to the solidity of the theatre, which had been run up in from fifteen to sixteen weeks ; and on April 14, 17Q4, the Committee of Public Safety ordered the transfer of the opera from the Porte Saint-Martin to the Saile Moiitansier, in the Rue Richelieu. M. Castil Blaze, excellent writer, but by no means free from prejudices, insists, in his \"History ot the Royal Academy of Music,\" that in the removal of the Opera to the Rue Richelieu there was a determination on the part of the Committee of Public Safety to burn down the National Library opposite which the ( )pera was now installed. \"How was it,\" he asks, \"that the Opera moved to a building exactly opposite the National Library \u2014 so precious and so combus tible a repository of human knowledge? The two establishments were only separated by a street very much too narrow ; if the theatre caught fire, was it not sure to burn the Library? That is what a great many persons still ask question ha- been reproduced a hundred tune in our journals. Go back to the time when the house was built by Mademoiselle Moiitansier ; read the Moniteur Universel, and you will see that it was precisely in order to expose this same Library to the happy chances of a fin that the great lyrical entertainment was trans ferred to its neighbourhood. The Opera over it, and threatened it constantly. At this house contains 1,000 seats The Ambigu- Comique, built on a sort of promontory which dominates the Boulevard Saint-Martin and the Rue de Bondi, was ..pelled in [829, in place of the original Ambigu, burnt to the ground two years previously. The new house, which contains 1,000 seats, was inaugurated in presence ot the Duchess of Berri, widow of the unhappy noble man who a few years before was stabbed by Louvois on the steps of the Opera House. In [837 this theatre was entirely rebuilt under the direction of M. Rochart. Untrue, like so many theatres, to its original name, the Am bigu-Comique was to become associated with nothing in the way of ambiguity, nothing in the way of comedy, but with melodramas, often of a most blood-curdling kind. Here, it is true, was produced tbe \" Auberge des Adrcts,\" which, in the hands of Frederic Lemaitre, was to be transformed from a serious drama into a wild piece of buffoonery ; so that the author of the work, too nervous to attend the performance himself, was almost driven mad when his trusted servant returned home and reported to him the of laughter with which the work had been received. At the Ambigu were brought out some ofthe best pieces of Alexandre Dumas the elder, Frederic Soulie, Adolphe Demierv , and Paul Fcval. Immediately adjacent ti 1 the Ambigu stand the Porte Saint-Martin anil Renaissance Theatres, covering the triangle formed by the Boule- vard Saint-Martin, the Rue de Bondi, and the de la Porte Saint-Martin. The Porte Saint-Martin Theatre has a long and interesting history, dating from June 8, [781, when it was opened as an (ipera House titter the destruction by fire of the one in the Rue Saint-Honore. A performance was going on at the time, and the singers had to fly in tbeir operatic dresses from the stage to the street. In the midst of the general consternation, the musical director, Rev by name, whose \" Coronis \" was the opera of the night, startled those around him, already sufficiently terrified, by exclaiming, \" Save my child ! Oh, Heaven, save my child I \" As Rey was not known in the character ofa family man, bis friends thought he bad gone mad. But it was the creature of his brain that was troubling him ; and after heroic struggles, the score of \"Coronis\" was rescued from the flames.

To shift the Opera to the Rue Richelieu \u2014 that Opera which twice in eighteen years had been a prey to the flames \u2014 to place it exactly opposite our literary treasures was to multiply to infinity tbe chances of their being burnt.\" Mercier, in reference to the literary views of the Committee of Public Safety, writes in the Nouveau Paris thus : \u2014 \" The language of Omar about the Koran was not mole terrible than that by the members of the Committee of Public Safety, when they carried this reso lution :\u2014 ' Yes, we will burn all the libraries, for nothing w ill be needed but the history of the Revolution and its laws.' \" If the motion of Henriot bad been put into effect, David, the great Conventional painter, was ready to propose that the same service should be rendered to the masterpieces in the Louvre as to the literary wealth of the National Library. Republican subjects, according to David, were alone worthy of representation. notre reine ' was hailed with transports of enthu siasm, and that the public called for it a second time.\" The bouse was well filled, but not crammed, as we see by the receipts, which amounted to 6,636 livres 15 sous. The same opera of Ranicau's, vamped by Candeille, had produced 6,857 livres on the 14th of the pre ceding June. On the night previous to the royal representation a gratuitous performance of \"Castor and Pollux\" bad been given to the public in honour of tbe Constitution. The royalists were present in great numbers on tbe night of state, and some lines which could be applied to the queen were loudly applauded. Marie Antoinette was delighted, and said to the ladies who accompanied her, \"You see that the people are really good, and wish only to love us.\" Encouraged by so flattering a reception, she determined to go the next night to the Opera Comique, but the king refused to accompany her. The piece per formed was \" Les Eveiiements imprevus.\" In the duet of the second act, before singing the words \" Ah /comme faimema maitresse,\" Mdme. Dugazon looked towards the queen, when a number of voices cried out from tbe pit, \" Plus de Maitresse!\" \"Plus dc Maitre/\" 'Tire la Liberte!\" This cry was answered from the boxes with \" I 'tie la reine/ lire le roi!\" Sabres and swordsticks were drawn, and a battle began. Idle queen escaped from the theatre in the midst of the tumult. Cries of HA bas la reine!\" followed her to her carriage, which went off at a gallop, with mud and stones thrown after it. Marie Antoinette returned to the Tuileries in despair. On the 1st of October, fourteen days afterwards, the title of Opera National was substituted for that of Academic Royale de Musique. The Constitution being signed, there was no longer any reason for being civil to Louis XVI. This was the third change of title in less than four months. ddte ( Ipera in the Rue Richelieu was, bow-ever, to he destroyed, as will afterwards be seen, not by fire, but in deliberate process us dilapida tion. Meanwhile, Louis XVI. and his family had fled from Paris on the 28th of June, 1791.

At the same time, the 1 was introduced of announcing the per formers' names, which was evidently an advan tage to the public, ami which was also not without its benefit for the inferior singers and dancers, who, when they unexpectedly appeared in order to replace their betters, used often to get hissed to .1 handsomer degree than they ever could in tbeir usual parts. To conclude the list of musical performances which have derived a gloomy celebrity from their connection with the last days of Louis XYL, we may reproduce the programme issued by the directors of tbe ( Ipera National on the fust anniversary of his execution, 1724. It ran thus : \u2014 \"On behalf of and for the people gratis. In joyful commemoration of the death of the tyrant, the National Opera will give to-day, 0 Pluviose, year 2 of the Republic, ' Miltiadcs at Marathon,' ' Tl of Thionville,' 'The ( HI. ring to Liberty.' \" By an order of the Committee of Public Safety, dated the 10th of the following Sep tember, the title of the < ipera was again cb to A Royale de Musique.

The kings, however, were turned into chiefs; princes and dukes became representatives of the people; seigneurs subsided into mayors ; and substitutes more or less synonymous were found for such offensive words as crown, throne, sceptre, etc. In a new Republican version of \" Le De'serteur\" as represented at the Opera Comique, /,\u25a0 roi, in one well-known line, was replaced by la lot and tbe vocalist had to declaim \" La loi pass, ut, et le tambour batfaii aux champs .' \" A certain voluble executant, however, is said to have preferred the following emendation: \"Le pouvoir execittif pass, ni, et le tambour battait aux champs .' \" The scenes of most of the new operas were laid in Italy, Prussia, Portugal\u2014 anywhere but in France, where it would have been indispensable from a political, and im- possible from a poetical, point of view to make the lovers address one another as citoyen, citoyenne. On the 19th of June, 1793, the directors of the Opera having objected to give a gratuitous performance of the \"Siege of Thion- ville,\" the Commune of Paris issued the following edict : \u2014 \"Considering that for a long time pasl the aristocracy has taken refuge in the admin istration of various theatres; considering that these gentlemen corrupt the public mind by the pieces they represent ; considering that they exercise a fatal influence' on the revolution: it is decreed that the ' Siege of Thionville ' shall be represented gratis, ami solely tor the amuse ment of the sans-culottes, who, to this moment, have been the true defenders of liberty and supporters of democracy.\" Soon afterwards it was proposed to shut up the Opera, but Hebert \u2014 tbe ferocious Hebert, better known as Le pere Duchesne \u2014 undertook its defenci the ground that it procured subsistence number of families, and \"caused the agreeable arts to flourish.\" until 1702 bv- four distinguished sans-culottcs\u2014 Henriot, Chaumette, Le Roux, and Hebert, the last 11. lined of whom had once been check-taker of the Academie. The others knew nothing whatever of operatic affairs. The management at the theatre was afterwards transferred to Franc\u0153ur, one ofthe former directors associated with Cellerier, an architect ; but the dethroned impresarios, accompanied by Danton and other Republican amateurs, constantly made their appearance behind the scenes, and very frequently did the chief members of the company the honour of Supping with them. In these cases the invitations, as under the ancient regime, proceeded, not from the artists, but from the artists' patrons ; with this difference, however, that under the Republic the latter never paid the bill. \"The chiefs of the Republic,\" says M. Castil Pda/e, \" were very fond of moistening their throats. Henriot, Danton, Hebert, Le Roux, Chaumette, had hardly taken a turn in the coulisses or in the foyer before they said to such an actor or actress, ' We are going to your room. See that we are properly received.' A superb collation was brought in. \\Yhc-n the repast was finished and the bottles were empty, the National Convention, the Commune of Paris, beat a retreat without troubling itself about the expense. You think, perhaps, that the dancer or the singer paid for the representatives of the people ? Not at all ; honest Maugin, who kept the refreshment room ofthe theatre, knew perfectly well that the actors of the ( Ipera were not paid, that they had ii.. sort of money, not even a rag of an assign at ; he made a sacrifice- : from delicacy he did not ask from the artists what he would not have dared to claim from the sans-culottes, for fear of the guillotine.\" Sometimes the executioner, who, as a public official, was entitled to certain entrees, made his appearance behind the scenes, and it is said that, in a facetious mood, he would some times express his opinion about the \" execution \" ot the music. Whatever the Opera may have been tinder the Reign of Terror, it was conducted infinitely better in one important respect than under the ancient regime. < Ipcratic kings and queens were suppressed by the Republic.

The free system of the University, the College or Gymnasium at from eight to ten francs a month, and the Conservatoire de Musique, with its en dowments, its scholarships, and its free tuition, all date from the first days of the Republic of 1789. the formal demolition of the Opera House, whose destiny was supposed to be fire, it hap pened in this way : \u2014 ( in the 13th February, 1820, which was the la-t Sunday of the Carnival, an unusually brilliant audience had assembled at the Opera House, or Academic- Royale, as it now once more was called, ddie Duke and Duchess of Berri were present ; and before the performance had been brought to an end, the duke, struck by an assassin, was a dead man. ddie circumstance- of the murder were very dramatic, not only by their theatrical surround- for the performance still went on while the duke was expiring in the manager's private apartments 1, but also by the remarkable way 111 which his whole life \u2014 with his double marriage and his two families \u2014 reproduced itself in the last tew hours of his existence. The opera or operetta ot the evening was at an end, and a portion of the ballet had been played, when the duke accompanied the duchess to her carriage, intending to return to his box to see the re mainder of the performance. Then it was that the assassin grappled with him and pierced him to the heart. The duke was carried to the director'- room, and in accordance with the practice of the day, was at once bled in both arms. The internal hemorrhage was still so great, that it was thought necessary to widen the orifice. \"There,\" says a contemporary writer, \"lay the unhappy prince on a bed hastily arranged, and already soaked with blood, surrounded by his father, brother, sister, and wife, whose poignant anguish was from time to time relieved bv some faint ray of hope, destined soon to be dis pelled. When Dupuytren, accompanied by four of his most eminent colleagues, arrived, it was thought for a moment that the duke might yet be saved. But it soon became evident that the case was hopeless. The duke's daughter had now been brought to him, and alter embracing her several times, he expressed a desire to see the king, Louis XVIII. Then arrived twoother daughters, the children of the union he had contracted in England. The duchess, seeing them now for tbe first time, received them with the greatest kindness, and said to them: 'Soon you will have no father, and I shall have three daughters.' In a neighbouring room the assas sin was being interrogated by the Ministers Decaze and Pasquier, with the bloody dagger on the table before them , while on the Stage the ballet of' Don Quixote' was being performed in presence of an enthusiastic public. In the course of the night the king arrived, and his nephew expired in his arms at half-past six the next morning, begging that his murderer might be forgiven, and entreating the duchess not to give way to despair.\" The theatre on whose steps the crime had been committed was now demolished. The other Paris theatres were not indeed pulled down, but they were shut up for ten days, and there was general mourning in France, not only because a prince of the blood had been murdered, but also because the direct line ot succession had to all appearance been brought to an end. It was not until more than seven months after the tragic scene at the Opera that the prince who was to have saved France, the \" Enfant du Miracle,\" was born. The arrival of tbe two daughters bom and brought up in England has been differently regarded by writers of different political views. Alexandre Dumas, in his Me/wars, ami ' Blaze, in his Histoire dc T Academie de Musiqut, represent the incident as a purely domestic one. M. Maiiroy, in his recently published works.

Chateaubriand, as a royalist, del not allow the character of legitimate children to the two girls brought to the bedside of their dying father, and entrusted by him to the care of his wife, the duchess. \"ddie Duke of Berri,\" writes Chateaubriand, in the Memoircs d'outre-Tombe, \"had had one of those liaisons which religion reproves, but which human frailty excuses. It may be said of him a- the historian has said of Henri IV. : ' He wa- often weak, but always faithful, and his passions never seemed to have enfeebled his religion.' The Duke of Berri, seeking vainly in hi- conscience for something very guilty, and finding only a few weaknesses, wished, so to say, to collect them around his death-bed, to prove to the world the greatness of his contrition and the severity of his penance. He had a suffi ciently just opinion of the virtue of his wife to confess to lar his faults, and to fulfil, beneath her eves, his desire to embrace those two innocent creatures, the daughters of his long exile. ' Let them be sent for,' cried the young princess; 'they tire my children also.' When the Viscountess de Gontaut, who had not been told beforehand, seemed astonished, Madame the Countess of Artois) noticed it, and said toher: 'She knows everything; she has been sublime ! ' \" 'l\"he rest i if Chateaubriand's narrative, es pecially as regards the Duke of Bend's two daughters, corresponds closely enough with the left by Dupuytren, whose style, somewhat expressive, somewhat emphatic for a man of nee, i- less copious, and also less magnilo quent than that of the marvellous author of /.\u25a0 Genie du Christianisme and of the Memoircs d'outre-Tombe. What the prince chiefly thought of in his last moments wtis his murderer, Louvel. \"Twenty times in the course of the fatal Dupuytren, the famous physician, whose account ot the scene was published not many y< \"he cried out, 'Have I not injured this man ? had he not some personal e to exercise against me?' In vain did Monsieur repeat to him, with tears in his 'No, my son, you never injured, you never saw this man; he had no personal ani- mosity against you.' ddie prince returned in cessantly to this groundless idea, and, without being conscious of it, furnished by his public and repeated inquiries the best proof that he had not provoked the frightful calamity which had befallen him. With this first idea he constantly associated another \u2014 that of obtaining pardon for his assassin. During his long and painful agony the prince begged for it at least a hundred times, and did so more earnestly in proportion as he felt bis end approaching. Thus, when the increasing gravity of the symptoms made him fear that he would not live long enough to see the king, he called out piteously, 'Ah! she lving will not arrive. I shall not be able to ask him to forgive the man.' Soon afterwards he appealed turn by turn to Monsieur and to the Duke of Augouleme, saving to them, 'Promise me, father, promise me, brother, that you will ask the king to spare the man's life.' But when at last the king arrived, he no sooner saw his Majesty than, summoning all his strength, he cried out, ' Spare his life, sir ! spare the man's life!' ' My nephew,' the king replied, 'you are not so ill as you think, and we shall have time to think of your request when you have re covered.' Yet the prince continued as before, the king being still on his guard not to grant a pardon which was equally repugnant to the laws of nature and to those of society. Then this generous prince exclaimed in a tone ot deep regret : 'Ah, sir! you do not say \"yes,\"' adding shortly afterwards : ' If the man's life were spared, the bitterness of my last moments would be softened.' As his end drew near, pursuing the same idea, he expressed in a low voice, broken by grief, and with long intervals between each word, the following thought : ' Ah ! . . . . if only .... I could carry away .... the idea .... that the blood of a man . . . . would not flow on my account .... after my death . . . . ' This noble prayer was tbe last he uttered. His constantly increasing and now atrocious pain absorbed from this moment all his faculties.\" The heroism of the Duke of Berri and his dying prayer for the pardon of his murderer may be contrasted with the cowardice of his grand father, Lotus XV., taking the last sacrament twice over when he had only been scratched; and the cruelty with which he caused bis as sailant, who, murderously disposed, no doubt, bad nevertheless scarcely injured him, to be subjected to the most frightful tortures, and finally torn to pieces by four hoi"], [110, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW.

Prince Louis was charmed with the lady's talents, and, on expressing his admiration, was astonished to find that she had come to Baden-Baden with no object but to help him in the attempt he was about to make on the other side of the Rhine. Boulevard de Sevastopol, on the other, Boule vard de Strasbourg. The Boulevard de Stras bourg was so designated (long before the Franco - German war, which suggests quite another origin for the name) in honour of the city where Prince Louis Napoleon made his first attempt to restore the Empire in France. The circumstances of the rash enter prise, represented at the time by the Government newspapers as merely ridiculous, were sufficiently romantic to deserve a few words of mention. Quitting his mother, with whom he had been living at the Castle < if Arenherg, in Switzerland, he went as if to take the waters at Baden-Baden, a place he found suitable to his purpose from its vicinity to Alsace, and from the opportunity it . 1 him of covering his ambitious views under the mask of pleasure. It was there that the prince gained the co-operation of Colonel Vaudrey, who commanded the 4th regiment ol artillery at Strasburg, in which frontier city the prince had resolved to proclaim the restoration of the Empire before marching towards the capital. The Alsacian democrats were to be gained over by holding out to them a prospect . ntation of the people, while the garrison of Strasburg was to be captivated by the cry of \" Vive VEmpereur! \" The citizens were to he summoned to liberty, and the young if the schools to arms. Idle ramparts were then to be entrusted to the keeping of the national guards, and the prince was to march to it the bead of the troop-. \"And then,\" Louis Blanc, in his sketch of tbe project, \"the pictures that naturally presented them- to the mind of Louis Napoleon were towns surprised, garrisons carried away by the move ment, young men eagerly enlisting among his adventurous followers, old soldiers quitting the plough from all quarters to salute the eagle borne aloft, amidst acclamations, caught up by echo echo ah .110 the loads; bitter recollections of the invasion, proud memories of the reviving, meanwhile, in every part of the rraine, and Champagne.\" Theardour The Strasburg expedition having failed, it pleased the enemies ofthe prince to cast ridicule upon it ; and he was accused of having exhibited himself in his uncle's boots, just as some years afterwards, in connection with the Boulogne expedition, he was said to have carried with him a trained eagle which at a given moment was to fly to the top of tbe Boulogne Column in memory of the Great Army. Both at Bou logne, however, ami at Strasburg the prince had considerable chances of success : a fact sufficiently proved (apart from tiny demonstration in detail) bv tbe popularity he was seen to p when, in 1848, he appeared as candidate for the Presidency of the French Republic.

The details of the ceremony were so minim fastidious that battles of etiquette constantly took place among the exalted persons figuring in the assembly. Formerly associated solely with the first at tempt of Prince Louis Napoleon to place him self mi the throne of France, the Boulevard ot Strasburg now seems to mark the fact that the Alsatian city, so thoroughly French in feel ing, has been made the capital of a province ot the German Empire. At the burial of Philip Augustus, the Papal Legate and the Archbishop of Rheims disputed for precedence ; and as neither would givi way, they performed service at the same time in the same church, but at different altars. A like scandal occurred at the funeral of St. Louis. When bis successor, Philip III., wished to enter the Abbey of Saint-Denis at the head of the procession, the doors were closed in his face. Tbe abbot objected to the presence, not ..1 the king, his master, but of the Bishop of Paris and tbe Archbishop ot Sens, whom he hail ob among the officiating clergy, and who, according to his view, bad no right to perform service in the Abbey of Saint-Denis, where be aim chief. The difference was arranged by the arch bishop and bishop stripping themselves oi their pontifical garments, and acknowledging the supremacy ofthe abbot in his own sanctuary. It has been said that tbe Boulevard Saint-Denis - the Boulevard tie Strasbourg ; and it terminates at the Porte Saint-Denis, erected two years earlier than the Porte Saint-Martin, to which it i- -uperior both by the boldness of its architec ture and by the magnificence of its ornamenta tion. The Porte Saint-Denis was constructed in 107 J by the order and at the expense of the City ot Paris, to celebrate the success of that astonishing campaign in which, during less than sixty days, forty strongholds and three provinces fell before tbe armies of the victorious monarch. The town side ofthe' arch hears, on the left, a colossal figure \"f Holland, 011 the right, another ofthe Rhine : two masterpieces, due to the chisel ofthe Auguier Brothers. At the top of the arch is a frieze representing in low relict the famous e of the Rhine under the orders of Louis XIV. On the Faubourg side the low relief at the top of the arch represents the taking of Maestricht. The Porte Saint-Denis bears this simple inscription: \" Ludovico Magno\" \u2014 \"To Louis the Great.\" At the death of Charles VI. it was found necessary to consult the Duke ot Bedford ih. conduct of the funeral ceremony, and under the direction of tbe foreigner it was performed with great magnificence. The duke observed as nearly as possible the ancient ceremonial, the only important variation being that (possibly in his character of Englishman) he ordered the interment to be followed by a grand dinner. Even at the dinner \u2014 where, at least, 0 might have been expected \u2014 there were absurd wranglings on points of etiquette between the State officials. At the end of the Rue Faubourg Saint-Denis is the necropolis ot Saint-Denis \u2014 the burial-place of the French kings. ddie obsequies of French kings have from the earliest times been attended with as much pomp and show as their coronations. It was not enough to embalm the body, place it in several elfins, and finally carry it to the royal burial place at Saint-Dents\u2014 to observe an elaborate ceremonial, which the Court functionaries and the officials of State followed out to the minutest detail ; the effigy of the dead king was exposed for forty days in the palace, stretched on a State bed, clothed in royal garments, the crown on the head, the sceptre in the right hand, and the brand of justice on the left, with a crucifix, a vessel of holy water, and two golden censers at the ii ot of the couch. The officers of the palace, meanwhile, continued their duties as usual, anil even went so far as to serve the king's meals as i h he were still living. The embalmed body was afterwards transported to the Abbey These mya] funerals naturally cost enormous sums of money, which were charged partly tu the Crown, partly to the City of Paris. The ob sequies of Francis I. took five hundred tli livres from the purse of his successor, without counting the contribution, probably of equal amount, from the town. The effigies of his two -on- who had died before him were carried With his own relics to Saint-Denis. Thus there wire three coffins in the procession.

Tbe Duke de Saint-Simon, in his Memoirs, speaks of this funeral as a very poor affair, remarkable only for the confused style in which it was conducted. The king had left no directions in regard to his burial ; and partly for the sake ot economy, partly to save trouble, it was decided to regulate the ceremonies by those observed at the interment of Louis XIIL, who, in his will, had ordered that they should simple tis possible. \"His modesty and humility, like the other Christian and heroic qualities hi . d, had not,\" says Saint-Simon, \"descended to his sun. But the funeral of Louis XIIL was accepted as a precedent, and no one saw the slightest objection to it, attachment and gratitude being virtues which had ceased to exist.\" Nor did the Duke of Orleans pay a flattering tribute to the royal memory, when, i though he had only just become, he absented himself from the ceremony of carrying the king's heart to the Grand Jesuits: \"that heart,\" says Saint-Simon, \"which loved no one, and which excited SO little love.\" horrible' condition in which they appeared in spired horror, and rendered credible all the cruelties they related when they were in full liberty.\" The story of the Italian prisoner who declined to leave the Bastille is interesting Irom its having anticipated \u2014 perhaps it suggested \u2014 the one told by another prisoner on the occasion of the Bastille being taken by the Revolutionists in ijSq. The funeral of Louis XY. was a very hurried affair. The king died on the ioth of .May, at twenty minutes past three. The whole Court instantly took flight, and there only remained with the body a few persons required for the care of it. The utmost precipitation was used in removing it from Versailles. None of the usual formalities were observed. Everyone was afraid to go near the body \u2014 undertakers, like the rest.. feared the small-pox, of which the king had died and the corpse was carried to Saint-Denis im an ordinary travelling carriage, under the care of forty members of the body-guard and a few pages. The escort hurried on the dead man in the most indecent manner, and all along the road the greatest levity was shown by the spectators. The public-houses were filled with uproarious guests ; and it is saitl that when the landlord of one of them tried to silence a troublesome cus tomer by reminding him that the king was about to pass, the man replied: \"The rogue starved us in his lifetime. Does he want us to perish of thirst now that he is dead ?\" A je. t different in style, but showing equally in what esteem Louis XV. was held by his subjects, is attributed to the Abbe of Sainte-Genevieve. Being taunted with the powerlessness of his saint and the little effect which the opening of his shrine, formerly so efficacious, had produced, he replied : \" What, gentlemen, have you to com plain of? Is he not dead ? \" In addition to the usual distribution of alms, the Regent of Orleans associated the funeral of XIV. with an exceptional act of mercy. A number of persons had been arbitrarily im- ed on let/res dc cachet and otherwise, some tor Jansenism and various religious and political offences, others for reasons known only to the king or his former ministers. The i ordered all the captives to be set at libertv, with the exception of a few who had been duly con victed of serious political or criminal misdeeds. Among the prisoners liberated from the Bastille ii Italian whose confinement had lasted thirty-five years, and who had been arrested the very day of his arrival at Paris, which he had come to see simply as a traveller. \" No one ever I knew why,\" says Saint-Simon; \"nor, like most of the others, had he ever been interrogated. It thought to be a mistake. When his liberty was announced to him, he asked sadly of what use it was to him. He said that he had liild, that he knew no one at Paris, nor even the name of a street, that his relations in Italy were probably dead, and that his property must have been divided among his heirs, on the supposition that he was dead.

The exhibition of the king's effigy in wax had in Louis XVIII. 's time been out of fashion for more than a century. But the customs observed in connection with the lying in-state of Louis XIV. were for the most part revived. The king, who died on the l6th of September, 1824, was embalmed, and on the iSth his body was exposed on a State bed in the hall of the throne. His bowels and heart had been enclosed in Caskets of enamel. The ex hibition ot the body lasted six days, during which it was constantly surrounded by the"], [120, "PARIS. OLD AND NEW. 100 happy.

Spain, Naples, and Parma. But the Revolution of 1848 in France and the war of 1859 in Italy cl three thrones of their Bourbon occupants, and the last of the- reigning Bourbons disapp when, in 1868, Isabella of Spain fled from Madrid. Thus, in the course of twenty years the four Bourbon crowns lost till real significance ; and the Bourbon sovereigns had simply increased the numbers of those \"kings in exile,\" so much more plentiful during the period ot M.

Received at the entrance to the church by the Dean of the Royal Chapter and the Grand Almoner of France, the body was placed on trestles in the chancel, while prayers were recited by the clergy. It was after wards removed to an illuminated chapel, where it lay exposed for a whole month, the chapter performing service- night and day. The inter ment took place on the 25th of October. The grand almoner celebrated a solemn mass ; and after the Gospel a funeral oration was pronounced by the Bishop of Hermopolis. Then four bishops uttered a benediction over the body, .mil absolu tion was pronounced ; twelve of the body-guard thereupon carrying the coffin down to the royal vault, where the grand almoner cast a shovel ful of earth on it, and blessed it, saying: \" Requiescat iu pace-\" The king-at-arms ap proached the open vault, threw into it his wand, helmet, and COat-of-arms, ordered the oth.i lu raids to imitate him, and calling up the grand it the Crown, told them to bring the insignia of the authority they held from the defunct king.

The royal sword and banner were only presented at the mouth of the vault.

In our own country the discontinuance ot what was at one time as much a custom in England as in France, or any other continental land, is probably due to tbe influence of the Reformation, which, condemning absolutely the adoration of the relies of saints, did not favour the respectful preser vation of relics of any kind. Great was the astonishment caused in England when in the last generation it was found that Daniel O'Connell had by will ordered his heart to be sent to Rome. The injunction was made at the time the subject of an epigram, intended to be offensive, but which would probably have been regarded by O'Connell himself as flattering; setting forth, tts it did, that the heart which was to be forwarded to Rome had never in fact been anywhere else. The reasons for which in the Middle- Ages hearts were enclosed in precious urns may have been very practical. Sometimes the owner of the heart had died far from home, and in accordance with his last wishes, the associated with all his noblest emotions was sent the theatre of death ; and the sceptre-bearers who have done so much barm to France and to humanity seem even in the grave to be proud ot their vanished greatness.

The first house on the Boulevard Poissonniere, at the corner ofthe street of that name, bears an inscription which fixes at this point the boundary of Paris in 1721., though by some authorities 17:0 is said to have been substituted for the true year in which tbe boundaries of Paris were marked \u2014 namely, 1702. The Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle, which comes next to the Boulevard Saint-Denis, is bounded tin the right by the Faubourg Poissonniere, and on the left by the Butte aux Gravois, on which was built in the seventeenth century the quarter named, after its parochial church, Notre-Dame di Bonne Nouvelle. The Bonne Nouvelle 1. constructed in the reign of Louis Philippe, contained, in the basement, a sort of theatre of considerable si/e, where, in 1 848, several political clubs and other conventions were established. Here on one particular day, arriving together by opposite staircases, Victor Hugo and Frederic Lcinaitre would present themselves at the speaker's desk erected for political orators. Ultimately, but not without some hesitation, tbe interpreter of Ruy Bias gave way to the creator of the part. The object ofthe assembly was to constitute in a permanent . bib for Parisian writers and artists ot the dramatic and other schools. Close by, at No. 20, is the Yicnncsc beer-house, established on the site of the theatre opened in 1838, where the company of the old Vaudeville Theatre took wh.n, on the [8th of July in that year, they were burnt out. With the last house on the Boulevard Poisson niere, at the corner ofthe Faubourg Montmartre, begins a whole series of celebrated restaurants. As the origin of this tamiliar word is not universally known, it may here be mentioned that it originated with an eating-house keeper, who inscribed above his establishment in large letters the following passage from the Gospel: \" Venite ad me et ego ' Restorabo ' vos.\" This restaurateur, or restaurant-keeper, had imitators, and the name which his quotation had suggested was applied to all ofthem. Paul Brebant, known as the restaurateur des lettres, has fed more than one generation of authors and journalists, who have not neglected him on becoming senators or ministers. A great number of monthly enter tainments tire given at this restaurant. Here dine together the Society of Men of Letters, the Dramatic Critics' Club, the Parisians, the Spartans, etc. Passing on, we next reach the ancient cafe of the Porte Montmartre, in stalled in the house which once belonged to the Marchioness tie Genlis, sister-in-law of the authoress who superintended the education ot the Orleans princes. There is now but one theatre on the Boule vard Bonne-Nouvelle \u2014 that of the Gymnase, 1 mi tbe 20th of December, JN20, under the patronage of the Duchess of Berri, who four afterwards allowed it to take the title of \"Theatre de Madame,\" which it retained until the Revolution of 1830. It was then entitled the \"Gymnase Theatre Dramatiquc,\" afterwards to be known simply as the Gymnase. For the Venty years the Gymnase bas been one of the very best theatres of the second order, ranking immediately after the theatres subven- thi State.

The money which he made by exhibiting the panoramas enabled him to con tinue his experiments in marine locomotion. To the left of the Passage des Panoramas was a strip of bind, on which, in 1806, the Theatre des \\Tarietcs was built. This little theatre, which, under the name of Varictes Montaitsier, occupied the site where now stands the Theatre du Palais Royal, had committed the offenci of attracting the public and filling its coffers with gold, while the Comedie Francaise, close to il, carcely been able to make both ends meet. The famous theatre where, at that time, tin principal actor was Talma and the principal Mil.. Mars, uttered a formal complaint; and the liberty ofthe Stage being then at an end, the Theatre des Varictes was expelled from the Royal, but allowed to take refuge in a new"], [124, "OLD AND NEW PARIS, ioa house built especially for it on the before-men tioned strip ot land. For many years the Theatre des Varietes undertook to amuse the public with the lightest comedies, in which such actor- as Brunct, Potier, Vernet, and Odry, such actresses as Flore and Jenny Vertpre appeared. After the Revolution of July, 1 830, it made experiments in a more serious style, producing, for instance, the \"Kean\" of Duma- the elder, with Frederic Lemaitre in the principal character, and Bressant in the part the Rue Montmartre and the adjoining Rue Richelieu. This was doubtless an exaggeration. Buta representation of this part of Paris, p in the days of the First Empire, shows that at the point in question there were ditches inter secting a road lined with trees. The Boulevard Montmartre combines some of the feat the upper and of the lower boulevard, the shops which here abound offering for sale objei use and of ornament, of interest and ot luxury; clothes, bonnets, books, chocolate, bonbon music. At the corner of the Boulevard Montmartre and the Rue Vi\\ lenne stood the famous public gambling - house nf Frascati, where, until the reign of Lmiis Philippe, as at a similar establishment in the Palais Royal, games of hazai publicly played. These gambling-houses bore an important, and often, no doubt, dis astrous part in the social life ol the French capital, and in numerable anecdotal have been told of the sums lost and won within their walls. Both comedy and tragedy bore a part in the scenes proif the fascinating cards Materials for a fares BOULEVARD BONNE-NOUVEI.LE AND THE GYMNASE THEATRE of the Prince of Wales. Under the Second Empire the Varietes returned to its old trade, besides adopting tin entirely new one \u2014 that of opera-bouffe, as cultivated by Offenbach. Here the earliest and best works of this master, such a- \" La belle Hcdene \" and the \"Grand Duchess of Gerolstein,\" were first performed, with Schneider and Dupuis in the principal parts. Her. too, some of the best comedies of Meilhac, Halevy, and Labiche were brought i mt. The Boulevard Montmartre, in front of the Varietes, is the most animated part of the whole line of boulevards.

It was impossible to be too severe with such a man. The actress, however, could not put up with him many months. He at length proved such a a cry of \"Thieves!\" and called in the police.

Attached to the Frascati gambling-house were illuminated gardens, imitated from those of the Italian Ridotto, and largely resorted to, under the Directory and the Consulate, by fashionable citizens. The original proprietor of the Frascati establishment, Garchi by name, died insolvent. The place was seized, and in 170.1 passed into the hands of one Perrin, whom Fouche, the celebrated minister of police, appointed Farmer- General of Games. Public gambling-houses were kept up in Paris until the year 1836, when, under Louis Philippe, the \"Citizen King,'' they were brought to an end. Buisson was treated by Balzac mi the moss friendly footing. Not only did the great novelisf allow the fashionable tailor to dress him for nothing, but he also paid him long visit used a special set of apartments assigned to him in a lofty region of Buisson's house, where in the midst of the workshops he was beyond the reach of troublesome creditors. Far from being un. grateful to his benefactor, Balzac has ren him immortal by naming him again and again in his works. Buisson will, thanks to Honore de Balzac, be always known as the fashionable tailor of Louis Philippe's reign. With the Frascati Gardens disappeared the charming villa built by Brongniart, with its Italian rims, its portico, and its statues. It was replaced by a house which was to enjoy a celebrity of its own.

On the connection between our tavern signs and our naval and military it would be superfluous to insist. We have, it is true, our Dogs and Ducks, our Geese and Gridirons, our Bells and Horns, but we have ur Admiral Keppels, our Wellington Arms, our Napier's Heads ; and taking them altogether, the names ofour hostelries indicate the various of their origin in a remarkable manner. Another characteristic of the British tavern sign as compared with the French enseigne, whether of the cafe, the restaurant, or the tobacco-shop, is the permanency of the former. Who ever heard ofthe \"Earl of Chatham\" being converted into the \" Sir Robert Peel,\" or of \" Lord Nelson \" turning into \" Sir Charles Napier \" ? Just the contrary takes place in France, where all the tobacco-shops, theatres, steamers, and even omnibuses that rejoice in what may be called representative titles, change their signs and their appellations with each successive dynasty. whose titles and interior arrangements might be looked upon as indicative of the social and intellectual movement of the nation. Of these, the most remarkable have, at various period-. been the huge Literary Cafe on the Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle, the Electric Cafes \u2014 of which there were at one time several \u2014 between the Porte Saint-Martin and the Theatre Lyrique, and the Cafe Oriental, near the Boulevard du Temple. Most provincial Frenchmen and foreigners who have visited Paris in the character of sight-seers have been conducted to the dreary Cafe des Aveugles, and probably to the absurd Cafe de- Singes ; but it is only those who have wandered idly about the boulevards, careless how they might be devoured, that can have found their way to the Literary, the Electric, or the Oriental Cafe. ddie Cafe Litteraire (to go back to some ancient notes made on the subject bv the present writer) \"was a building of which it would be little to say that it was more magnificent than tin English palace. Above the portico the title ofthe estab lishment, in gigantic letters and in striking relief, was conspicuous. The stone staircase which led to the entrance was so imposing that as you ascended it you instinctively put your hand in your pocket to assure yourself that you had a respectable number of francs at your disposal. In the vestibule stood two officials; one the under-waiter, the other the sub editor of the establishment. 'Does monsieur wish to cat?' ' Do monsieur wish to read?' said the two functionaries at the same moment. Anxious to offend neither, ami not possessing the art of eating and reading simultaneously, we replied that we wished to play billiards. 'You will find the professor and tables in abundance on the first floor,' said the under-waiter. 'Allow me to present you with the carte of my depart ment ; ' and be handed me an ordinary carte da fair. ' Here is the carte ofthe department with which I have the honour to be connected,' said the sub-editor, giving me at the same time an astounding unheard-of literary bill of fare, with dishes by Lamartine and Victor Hugo, But it is above all in the cafes proper that the history of France is to be read ; and not the political history alone, for it can be shown that .. reflect every social, literary, and com- I change that takes place in the French metropolis. The demoiselle du comptoir in the popular quarters of Paris is herself an important historical figure, appearing as she did during the African war as an Algcriennc, in the i second Republic as a priestess of Liberty, and during the siege of Sebastopol as a ' girl of the Crimea. But she is a political rather than a social index. Such also were the i Cooks, whose miserable gargotes flourished during the Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity . with their b\u0153uf a la Republique, their 1 a la Robespierre, their reau a la baton- then mouton ii la sauce rouge.

After dining we repaired to the billiard room and played a couple of games, for which two francs and a half were charged. Having paid the debt, and received a voucher for the sum, we were waiteil on by the eilitor-in-chief. In strict justice, the voucher entitled us to two volumes and a half, but the editor assured us that it was contrary to the rules of the establish ment to serve less than an entire livraison. To ask for half a livraison, he said, was like ordering balsa mutton-chop or balsa lemonade.\" his change the new customer experienced a sharp shock, being the more astonished inasmuch as the habitues present put down and took ui money evidently without feeling the electric current.

His friend no sooner tout than he started back electrified, but he him. self found that he could this time touch it with impunity. He had now obviously been admitted amongst the initiated ; and when he had on drinking and spending enough to entitle him to confidence, the beautiful demoiselle du loir condescended to explain to him the entire mystery. At the foot of the metal count a piece of strip iron connected with one ofthe wires of a galvanic battery, the other wire communicating with the counter itself. When any of the initiated touched the counter the presiding goddess stopped the current, which only novices were intended to feel. The whole tic-vice was simply employed to customers. The electric counters became very popular, and had rapidly spread all over Paris, when the Government, thinking probably that such practical jokes might sometimes be carrietl too far, absolutely suppressed th. electriques. The establishment of the Cafe Litteraire was contemporaneous with the first issue, on a large scale, of three-franc volumes ami four-sou hvraisons, with liberty of the Press, open discussion, and the ascendency of literary men in connection with politics.

He was lunching there one day with a joyous party of friends, when a bottle of cham pagne was opened, of which the cork struck the ceiling and left a mark there. To Compensate for this mishap, the famous painter ordered a ladder to be brought in, and hurriedly, but with consum mate art, painted a swallow where the cork had -truck. Years passed, and still the swallow re mained fresh, ddie form and colour of the bird were renewed from time to time by Other painters ; but to the sight-seer, as informed by the waiters of the cafe, it was always the very swallow that had been painted in the midst of a cham- luncheon by Carle Vernet. It was as clear and bright as ever when at last it dis- red with the ceiling it had so long adorned. ddie cafe, in spite of the number of new clubs established in Paris, continues to be one of the most popular and most flourishing instituti the French capital.

Of Bohemian cafes \u2014 those frequented, that is to say, by the gipsies of literature and art \u2014 th celebrated is, or was in the time of Henri .Minuet, the brilliant author of \" La Vie tic Boheme,\" the Cafe Momus. Here' it was that poets, paint. musicians ofthe future, blessed for the present with more genius than halfpence, waited until comparatively wealthy lover of art and literature came to their relief, or until, by their nois) and reckless talk, they forced the alarmed proprietor to beg them to retire, and come in some other day to pay for their refreshment. Champfleury, gleaning here and there after Murger's abundant harvest, has told us how, armed with one cup us coffee and a small glass of brandy, half-a-dozen Bohemians would take absolute possession of the first floor of this establishment. Close to the Cafe Foy stood the Cafe des Avetigles, with an orchestra of blind men as its distinctive feature. It seems at that period to have been thought strange that blind men should be able to perform on musical instruments. In the present day no virtuoso of any pretension plays with notes ; though those, no doubt, are tbe least blind who do not pride themselves mi disregarding what may well be a valuable, if not indispensable-, aiil to memory. A traditional figure associated with the orchestra of blind musicians was a so-called \" savage \" : some personage, that is to say, from one of the Paris faubourgs, disguised with feathers, paint, and tattooing. Sometimes a Bohemian, not absolutely titutc, would order a cup of coffee and a/W/, and go upstairs. Soon afterwards a second Bo hemian would come in, ask if the first Bohemian were in the cafe, and go upstairs to join him. A third would ask for the second, a fourth for the third, and so on, until around the solitary cup of coffee and the unique glass of liqueur a party of six had assembled. The proud paymaster, attef sipping a little of tbe coffee, would pass it to a friend, who, having helped himself, would hand the remainder to some other member \"1 the party. The cognac was in like manner and the last served came in for the sugar, with which he would sweeten a glass ot water. The Bohemian frequenters of the Cafe Momus were more liberal in giving their orders when one ot them had sold a picture or a piece ot mi book or a play ; and they would afterwards order on credit as long as credit could be obtained. A story is told of one Bohemian who persisted in ordering after bis credit had been stoppei win., having told the waiter repeatedly, but in vain, to bring him a cup of coffee, went himself to the counter, and said in a stern voice, \" I ordered a cup of coffee half-a-dozen times ; either After the Revolution the cafes became more and more political. Udider the Republic, as in a less degree under the Empire, there had been no opposition cafes. But with the Restoration some freedom of thought returned.

It must be supposed that it somehow suited the proprietor of the Cafe Momus to encourage, 01 at least tolerate, his Bohemian visitors ; other wise he would have taken step- to exclude them permanently. Occasionally, it is said, they would barricade themselves in their favourite room on tbe first floor, and refuse absolutely to give up possession. The probability is that when they were in funds they spent their money lavishly ; and they undoubtedly gave a certain reputation to the Case Momus, which became known throughout Paris as the cafe of literary aspirants, anil attracted mi that ground a certain number of sympathisers and admirers. On the 10th of February, 1073, the \" Mahule Imaginaire \" was performed for the first time. The curtain rose at four o'clock, and a few minutes afterwards Moliere was on the stage, and acting with his accustonied humour. Everyone was laughing and applauding. None of the audience suspected that the actor who was throwing all his energy into the part he had himself created was now on the point of death. In the burlesque ceremony, just as Argan has to utter the word \" Juro,\" a convulsion seized him, which he disguised beneath a forced laugh. But it was now necessary to carry him home. The performance went on, though without Moliere, who meanwhile had been taken to his house in the Rue Richelieu. It had been found im possible to get his clothes off. The dying man was still wearing the dressing-gown of the \"Imaginary Invalid.\" He was presently at tacked with a violent fit of coughing, in the course of which be burst a blood-vessel and threw up a quantity of blood. A few minutes later he expired, surrounded by the members of his family, and supported by two nuns to whom he was in the habit of offering hospitality when they visited Paris. In his dying moments he had asked for religious consolation ; but the priest of St.-Eustache rejected his prayer. Now that he was dead, Christian burial was denied to him : a piece of intolerance due to the Arch bishop of Paris, Harley de Champvalon. So soon as .Moliere's wife heard ofthe archbishop's refusal, she exclaimed with indignation : \" They refuse to bury a man to whom, in Greece, altars would have been erected.\" Then calling tor a carriage, and taking with her the Cure of Auteuil, who was far from sharing the views of his ecclesiastical superior, she hurried to Versailles, threw herself at the king's feet, and demanded justice. \" If,\" she exclaimed, losing all self-control \u2014 \" if my husband was a criminal, his crimes were sanctioned by your Majesty in person.\" At these words the king frowned, and the Cure of Auteuil is said to have found the moment opportune for introducing a theological discussion, in the course of which he sought to disculpate himself from an accusation of Jan senism. But Louis XI Y. had been affronted, and he told both actress and cure that the matter concerned the archbishop alone. He sent secret orders, however, to the churlish prelate, the result of which was a compromise. The body was refused entrance into the church, The house formerly occupied by the Frascati establishment bears on the Rue Richelieu side a medallion with an inscription to the memory ..f Cardinal de Richelieu, put up by Antoine Elwart, professor ot composition at the Con servatoire. The other side of tbe Boulevard i. litre, whence springs the Rue du Fau- Montmartre, is no less animated than the theatre side. Here, too, cafes abound, each of which, in theatrical phrase, is \"full to over flowing\"; for numbers of customers sit out in the street at the little tables in front of the cafe. The arcade on this side of the boulevard is known as the Passage Jouffroi. It runs through what was once the ground-floor of the house which, under the Restoration, was inhabited by three distinguished composers : Rossini, Carafa, and Boieldieu. A little further on, always in the direction of the Madeleine, stands an impor tant club, called officially Le Grand Cercle, familiarly, Le Cercle des Ganaches. It is com- chiefly of commercial men and civil servants. It is considered old-fashioned, and the dinner-hour there is six o'clock, as it was in most Paris houses fifty years ago. At the right corner of the Rue Grange Bateliere stands an immense house, on a site occupied, until a few years ago, by the mansion built in the eighteenth century, by two well known farmers-general, the Brothers Lunge, which from [836 to 1S47 was the haunt of the Jockey Club, the best-known and most fashion able club in Paris, now installed further to the ut still in tbe line of boulevards.

They could not now prevent his being buried in sacred ground. But on the day ol his funeral they organised a riot in front ot his house, which Mme. .Moliere, frightened by the ..X IHE BuULEVARD MONTMARTRE. practically it may have ceased to be effective, has never been rescinded. In France up to the time of the Restoration ( 1814), or at least during the Restoration, it was in full force, so that the history of the relations between Church and stage in that theatre-loving country has the history of the refusal of Christian burial in successive centuries to stage-players. H for many years past theory and' practice have been at variance in France with regard to the excommunicated position of actors and ai The Church, however much it may stand above society, cannot but reflect in some views' of society at large ; and, if onl) policy, it cannot permit itself to outi universal feeling.

Moliere was buried in the Cemetery of Saint Joseph, Rue Montmartre.

Sa.xe at once declared that the accusation made by the soldiers was entirely without basis, and the general did not hesitate to accept his assur ance. He enjoined him, however, to hurry away as quickly as possible from the boulevard, which was about to be \" swept \" by a fusillade. Saxe and bis friends managed narrowly to escape. THE Boulevard des Italiens derives its name from the so-called Comedie Italicnne, the original Opera Comique of Paris, which owes its existence to letters patent granted to it as far btu I '6. One of the most celebrated establishments on this boulevard is the Cafe Cardinal, at the corner of tbe Rue Richelieu. It justifies its title by exhibiting the bust of the famous political prelate, concerning whom the great Corneille, after receiving, first benefits, then injuries, at his hands, wrote these lines : \u2014 \"i, hi'. .11 parle mat ou bien .lu sameux cardinal, Ni ina prose, ni mes vers n'en tliront jamais rien. II m'a fait trop de bien pour en dire du mai, II m'a fait trop tie mai pour en dire du bien.\" * Formerly known as the Cafe Dangest, the title it now bears has belonged to it only since the year 1830. Just round the corner stands the house of the well-known music publishers, . Brandus and Co., founded bv Moritz Schlesinger, who, as a voting man, brought out of Beethoven's works, and was indeed one oi Beethoven's first appreciators. During the coup (slilat of 1851 M. Brandus's hospitable ice was the scene ot all outrage which ti lied to become a tragedy on a large scale. He was entertaining a party of friends, among whom were M.

The Ope'ra Comique of France descends indeed in a straight line from the most ancient dramatic entertainments given in that country. These were introduced in the sixteenth century by natives of the land to which the French owe nearly all the lighter and more ornamental part of their civilisation, from opera and the drama to ices and confectionery: from architecture, pictures, and statues, to gloves, fans, gambling houses, and masked balls. In 1570 Henri III. invited from Venice to Paris a company known as \"I Gelosi.\" The actors were \" jealous \" or \" zealous \" to please ; and a contemporary writer informs us that after playing at the Hotel de Bourgogne, where every one was charged four sous for admission, they took possession of the Hotel du Petit Bourbon, where such crowds assembled that \"the four in Paris could nut together have collected such a congregation.\" The same writer adds that on the 26th of June following tin Parliament forbade \" I Gelosi \" to play their \" Whether good or evil be spoken ofthe famous Cardinal, neither my prone n.,r my verse shall lay a word of him.

A few years afterwards a second troop \"t \"Gelosi,\" and then a third, came to and later on Henri IV. brought from Paviaanew company, which stayed in Paris for two yen-. comedies any longer, as they taught \"nothing but impropriety.\" The Italian actors, however, 1 the Parliamentary decree, and they obtained from the king letters patent per- mitting them to continue their performances, consisting,\" says Mezerai, \"of pieces of in- BOULEVARD DES 1TAI.IEN: trigue, amourette-, an 1 agreeable inventions for awakening and exciting the softest passions.\" ddie Italian actors presented these letters patent to the Parliament the month following, when the letters were rejected, and they them selves forbidden to present to the Court such document-, under a penalty of ten thousand Paid- livres. The Italians, however, appealed once more to the king, when Henri III. granted express permission, in virtue of which they re opened their theatre in December, 1577. As, Cardinal Mazarin (or Mazarini) did much to familiarise Parisians both with Italian i and Italian plays ; and about 1660 one of several Italian companies which bad recently visited Paris obtained permission to play at the Hotel de Bourgogne alternately with the French actors. But at last, in their love of satire, the Italia\" actors forgot themselves so far as to turn into ridicule no less ti personage than Mme. d -Maintenon. \" The king,\" says the Duke de Saint"], [137, "THK D()X JUAN OF MOLIERE.

As long as they restricted themselves to indecency, or even impiety, nothing but laughter was ex cited.\" But they took the liberty of playing a piece called /'//'\u25a0 False Prude, in which Mine. tic .Maintenon w as easily recognised. Accordingly, .ne went to see it ; but after three or four illations, the actors were ordered to close theatre and quit the kingdom within a month. many minatory decrees, an arrangement was made between the Italian actors and a company of French actors and singers which led to the establishment ofthe French (Ipera Comique. At last the Italian and the French actors played together ; but French wit and Italian wit were said not to harmonise, and in order to simplify matters, the Italians, with the exception ot one or two who had adopted the French language, were sent out of the country. The theatre now given up to French comic opera con tinued, however, to be called the Theatre Italien, to receive afterwards, in memory of Mme. Favart .mil her husband, the title of Salle Favart, and at a later period, under the Republic, that of Opera Comique. This caused a great noise ; and if the actors lost their establishment by their boldness and folly, the Government which drove them out did not gain bv the freedom with which the ri diculous incident was criticised. The Lieutenant of Police, accompanied by an army of commis- geants, and constables, had invaded ized the manuscript of The Da/se Prude. Jherardi, the harlequin of the troupe, hurried to illes, where he begged and entreated, but without being able to move Louis XIV., who many times protected the Italian co medians. \" You came to France on foot,\" said the king,, \" and you have gained enough here to lack in carriages.\" The performances of tbe Italians came per manently to an end in 1 7^3. In spite of the jealousy with which they were regarded by the great bulk ofthe theatrical profession, the Italian actors had an excellent effect on the development ofthe French stage, which, when the first troupe of Gelosi arrived in Paris, had no substantial existence. Moliere profited much by their per formances and borrowed freely from their pro ductions, taking from them, according to his well-known saving, \"his property\" (that is to say, all that naturally belonged to him through affinity and sympathy) wherever \"he found it.\" Apart from many other subjects and scenes, Moliere borrowed his version of Don Juan from the Italians. Much of it, including most \"I its philosophy and wit, belongs in the very fullest sense to the great comic dramatist of France. But the very title, Festin dc Pierre \u2014 an incorrect and, indeed, unintelligible trans lation of // Convitato dc Pietra \u2014 is enough to show the origin of Moliere's admirable work. During their stay in Paris the Italian actors led by Louis XIV. had accustomed them- io play in French, and the celebrated comedy writer, Regnard, had entrusted them with several ut his pieces. This rendered them than ever disliked by the French actors, xv- it li whom they were always in rivalry. The performed by the Italian actors consisted lor the most pail, and always when they confined lo their own language, of mere dra matic sketches, for which dialogue was supplied by the actors themselves. The new establishment had been only ten years on the Boulevard ties Italiens when its name was altered definitely from Comedie Italicnne to Opera Comique. A few years later the establishment was moved to the Rue Feydcau, where it was destined to enjoy a long life and a merry one. Meanwhile, tbe house which bad given its ancient name to the Italian boulevard remained unoccupied \u2014 or but rarely occupied \u2014 for some considerable time, until, in l8lS, the celebrated Catalan! opened it for serious Italian opera. It was not until 17 10 that the Italian actors \u2022I in France, and they now played at a theatre in the Palais Roy til, occupied alternately in and by the company of the Grand ( Ipera.

Favart was at hist obliged to make her escape, and, forsaking the camp, returned to the capital. Here she appeared at the so-called Italian Theatre, which was really the Opera Comique under another name. This theatre, like all others, was soon destined to perish by fire ; and Italian opera has ot late years led a somewhat wandering lite in France, to find itself ultimately without any home at all. The early history of the ( >pera Comique, from the middle of the eighteenth until the first days of the nineteenth century, is sufficiently repre sented by the lives of two of its most distin guished ornaments : Mme. Favart and her successor in parts of the same kind, Mme. Dugazon. Mme. Favart\u2014 Duronceray by her maiden name\u2014 was the wife of Charles Simon Favart, the well-known dramatist, who for many years supplied the Opera Comique with all its good pieces. The marriage took place in 1745, and immediately afterwards the (ipera Comique, as an establishment recognised and subventioned bv the State, was suppressed. Favart had some time before made tile acquaintance of Marshal Sa.xe, who may be said to have played almost as great a part in connection with the stage as with the camp ; and be was now invited by the famous commander to organise a company tor giving performances at the head -quarters, and for the entertainment ofthe army in Flanders generally. Favart hurried to Brussels, where .Marshal Sa.xe was about to arrive ; and on reaching the head quarters, the commander -in-chief gave an enter tainment to tbe ladies whose husbands were serving on bis staff, and to the wives generally of the officers. The performance consisted of national dances by the Highland contingent, wh..-e scanty costumes are said to have at once amused ami scandalised the ladies. Then a piece of Favart's was played ; and with so much success, that it became the fashion to attend Favart representations as often as they were given. Marshal Saxe told Favart that it was part of his policy to give theatrical entertain ments, and the manager soon saw that his musical comedies interested the officers suffi ciently to take them away from cards ami dice, lo which previously they had given themselves up with only too much devotion. The marshal pointed out to Favart, moreover, that a lively couplet, a few happy lines, would have more effect on French soldiers than tbe most eloquent harangues. Besides amusing his own people and keeping them out of mischief, Marshal Saxe found Favart's Comic Opera Company useful in promoting his negotiations with the enemy. Having heard of the Favart performances, the enemy desired much to see them ; and the repre sentation-given in the enemy's camp had no slight effect in facilitating peace arrangements. .Mme. That Mine. Favart was greater as an a than as a vocalist (which may be said of so many singers who have distinguished themseh the Opera Comique of Paris) is beyond doubt. \" She is not a singer,\" said Gretry, thecomposer; \"she is an actress who speaks song with the truest and most passionate accent.\" \"What a wonderful woman ! \" exclaimed Boieldieu, after a representation of his Caliph of Bagdad. \"They say she does not know music ; yet I never heard anyone sing with such taste and expression, nature and fidelity.\" Boieldieu, through Auber, his successor, brings us to modern times. With Ambroise Thomas, the composer of Mignon, and Bizet, the com poser of Carmen, the Opera Comique has always been the most French of all the French nitisie.il theatres. At the Grand Opera, or Academie, nearly all the successful works have been com posed by foreigners: by Lulli, Gluck, Piccinni, Spontini, Rossini, Meyerbeer, Donizetti, and Verdi. The most popular works at the Comique have, on tbe other hand, been com posed by Frenchmen. La Dame Blanche, sot instance, of Boieldieu ; the Fra Diavoh, The Black Domino, The Crown Diamonds ot Auber; the Mignon of Ambroise Thomas, and the Carmen of Bizet, have all been due to the genius ot Frenchmen.

The last \"I these was its destruction by a terrible tire. in which more than one hundred lives were lost. Since this catastrophe, which took place on the 22nd of May, 1887, the Opera Comique has been provisionally established in the du Chatelet.

The aims of the Saint-Simoniaiis, try as they may have been, were at least noble; and the society numbered among h~ members some ofthe most able and high-minded men of the dav. Ihe truth of this latter assertion is proved by the distinguished part played bv many of the Saint-Simonians in very different spheres after the society had come to an end. Michel Chevalier, the political econo mist, Duveyrier, the dramatist, and Felicien David, the composer, may be mentioned among Saint-Simonians whose names will be familiar to many Englishmen. unhappy experimentalist had now had a bitter experience of poverty, which may or may not have been in his general programme. His enthusiasm ended in any case by inspiring a few rich men who possessed the money necessary for carrying out his id. Saint-Simon's mantle fell upon Le Pere Enfan tin, who presided over the Saint-Simonian family in the Rue Monsigny, until pecuniary embi incuts caused the learned and venerable father to give up the publication of the admirably written Saint-Simonian journal, The <fh, be, and to retire from a bouse for which, unhappily, rent had to be paid, to a bouse and garden of his own at Menil montant. Here he collected around him forty disciples, determined to work together under Le Pere Enfantin's direction. \" Poets, musicians, artists, engineers, civil and military,\" says a writer, fully in sympathy with the Saint-Simonians, even if he was not himself a member of tbeir body, \" applied themselves by turns to the hardest and rudest labours. Saint-Simon, founder of tbe sect named after him, began bis self-imposed career with a suffi ciently large fortune to enable him to test various mod.- of existence. His purpose was, after ing society, to reform it. He had resolved Iv it thoroughly in :. 11 its phases: all those t, which offered ..ny special intellectual or physical character. Without apparently having conceived any system beforehand, he was constantly working towards one, making obser vations and writing down notes. That he might waste no time from sluggishness or : loth, he ordered his servant to wake him every morning with these significant words : \" Rise, Count ; you . i eat things to do.\" ( Lev ez -vous, Monsieur ramies choses a faire. ) political principle that he ultimately adopted was that \" :.ll legislation should be for the benefit ot the poorest and most numerous which was little more than a variation ot Bentham's \"greatest good ofthe greatest number.\" \" They repaired the house, regularly swept and kept in order the rooms, offices, and courtyard, cultivated the grounds, covered the walks with gravel, which they procured from a pit they bad themselves with much toil opened, and so on. To prove that their ideas upon tbe nature ot marriage and the emancipation of women were not founded upon the calculations of a voluptuous selfishness, they imposed upon themselves the law of strict celibacy. Every morning and evening they refreshed their minds with the discourses of Le Pere Enfantin, or sought in the lite of one of tbe Christian saints, read aloud by one of them to the rest, examples, precepts, encouragement. Hymns, the music to which had been composed by one of their number, M. Felicien David, served to exalt their souls, while soothing their labour. At five o'clock the horn announced dinner. The workmen then piled their tools, ranged the wheelbarrows round trden, and took their places, after having chanted in chorus the prayer before meat. All this the public were admitted to see : a spectacle in which a sneering, jesting nation only marked the singular features, by turns simple and sublime, but which was assuredly deficient in neither aim nor m abstract grandeur, For in this practice of theirs tbe apostles of .Menilmontant went far beyond their ow n theories, and were sowing around them unconsciously the seeds ot doctrine which were destined one day to throw iwn into oblivion.\" He lived in aristocratic society a life of pleasure, Studii d ..mono scientific- men, and finally, occupying himself with books and newspapers, dun-ell the centre of all kinds of literary gathering-.

In his defence, Le Pere Fnfantin admitted, while rejecting with indignation the charge of immoral teaching, that one of the main objects of Saint-Simonianism was the reorgan isation of property. \" ddie misery,\" he said, \"of the working classes and the wealth of idle men are the main causes of the evils we seek to remedy.

Cafe Anglais, now the only one remaining of the historical Paris restaurants, which for the most part date their reputation from the years 1814 and 1 81 5, when the European Allies had their head-quarters in the French capital. The in vasions which re~tored the French Monarchy, and which bad been undertaken with no other object, brought defeat, but at the same time prosperity and gaiety to Paris; whereas the invasion of 1N70 and 1871 caused nothing but misery to tbe vanquished. During the early davs, if the Restoration such iiotise-s as Les Trois Freres Provencaux, in the Palais Royal, La Maison Doree, the Cafe Riche, and the still extant Cas. Anglais, did a magnificent trade, thanks to the number of Prussian, Russian, Austrian, anil English officers who frequented them, and who, after the toils of war, abandoned themselves willingly to sonic of tbe joyj of La Maison D.oree used to be kept by a pro prietor named Hardy, and the fact that the neighbouring cafe and restaurant, of almost equal celebrity and dearness, belonged to a Monsieui Riche, whose name it bore, gave rise to the sav ing that a man must be \" Ires riche pour diner che: Hardv, et ties hardi pour diner che: Die lie.\" The Cafe Riche used to be the favourite dining place ot Jules Janin on evenings of first perform ances. Here on these interesting occasions he was always to be seen ; and tbe usual genial tone of his criticism- was possibly attributable to the excellence of M. Riche's chef. Not, however, that Janin wrote his notices of new plays the same night. He published them week by week in the feuilleton of the Journal des D afterwards t\" be corrected and published under the title of \"Questionable History of Dramatic Literature .\" peace. Most of thc-se famous restaurants sprang from hops ; tor it is a fact that every celebrated dining-place in Paris has owed its reputation primarily to the quality of its wine. The three brothers from Provence who started the .ant known under their name were simply three young men who, having vineyards of their own ami a connection with other wine-growers, maintained an excellent cellar. But when people came in to taste its contents it was abso lutely necessary, in order to rentier appreciable the flavour ot the wine, to give them something to cat. Then, as they spent their money freely, it wa- found possible and even desirable to engage a first-rate cook ; until at last the re putation of the cellar was equalled by that of the kitchen. The (\"ale Riche was never such a late house as La Maison Doree, which went on day by day and year by year, never closing, regardli the clock. Thus it was at once the earliest ami the latest of Paris taverns ; and if it was possible to get supper there at 3 or 4 o'clock ill the morning after a dull evening party, a traveller was equally sure that the place would he open when, arriving at Paris by train at, sav, 0 in the morning, the vacuum in his stomach de manded an immediate breakfast. Who has not read of Les Trois Freres Proven caux in Balzac's \" Scenes from Paris Life\"? It was in one of their upstair- rooms, moreover, facing the garden of the Palais Royal, that the hero of Alfred de Musset's \" Enfant du Siecle \" had hi- last sad interview, his hist sad meal, with the young woman from whom he was about to separate for ever. A story is told of a gentleman who, living immediately opposite the side entrance nt La Maison Doree, dedicated to this famous hostelry all the time he did not spend in bed. ' La Maison Doree, too, was a famous ho"], [143, "LA MAISON DORfiE. levards.] 123 extremely late, he turned into the Maison Doree towards four in the afternoon to look at the papers, converse with some of the frequenters, take a preparatory okis- of absinthe, and finally dme\u2014 this being, of course, tbe great event of his well-spent day. His dinner began at an advanced hour of the evening, and lasted well int.. the night. Then he was joined by friends from the theatre bent on supping ; and it was not till towanl.s sunrise that he returned to his apartments over the way. reached the greatest proficiency; and their methods and customs have accordingly been more imitated than those of any other nation. Of their cookery there is but one opinion ; for every man in Europe who can afford a great table keeps either a French cook or a cook educated in the French school. The variety given by French cooks to the very simplest dish is too well known to require emphasis; and even Macaulay quotes the story of that Parisian chef who could make twelve different dishes out of a poppy-head. Unlike the Temple of Janus, which was never shut in time of war, the Maison Doree could only keep its doors open in time of peace. Such war, .it all events, as the Prussians brought to ttes of Paris and to Paris itself in 1N70 and was fatal to its existence. Since those terrible years Paris has lost something of its gaiety and frivolity. The Cafe Anglais still exists ; but even at this celebrated supping-place ot former years supper is now an unknown meal. Nothing is served in the Cafe Anglais after nine o'clock. This cafe, oddly enough, seems to have been named after a nation which in the year 1815 can scarcely have been popular among the French. Its origin, or at least its name, Irom the year of the Waterloo campaign, and, strangely enough, it is the only great restaurant of that period which to this day survives. Possibly the establishment was not called Cafe Anglais merely by way of invitation to the English portion of the occupying forces. The title may have been meant to indicate that rvice of the table was conducted after the English rather than the French fashion. The French, it must be admitted, preceded us in the matter of napkins, and also, if their boast on the subject can be admitted, in the earlier Use of four-pronged forks, made by preference of silver. Rut in the year 1815 tbe blench knew nothing of salt-spoon- ; and though plates were changed frequently enough, the same knife and fork I throughout the various courses, the diner cleaning on a piece of bread a knife which did duty tor every dish which came on the table. It replaced the salt-spoon, and was frequently onveying foul to the mouth.

It is true that the French artisan would imt dine without a clean napkin on bis knee ; but it is equally true that the French aristocrat would sometimes spit about the floor in presence of a duchess with a freedom which would be resented in any English tap-room. If Paris be really \" the Tavern of Europe,\" the Cafe Anglais is at this moment the Tavern of Paris. Scarcely any foreigner of distinction visits the French capital without dining, perhaps even bv special arrangement supping, at the Cafe Anglais, which is now under the management, not of an enterprising landlord, but of a well regulated Limited Liability Company. At the corner of the Rue tie Grammont, separated from the Cafe Anglais by the Theatrical Bureau, or \"Office de Theatre,\" which supplies tickets for every playhouse in Paris, is the Librairie Nouvelle, where, exhibited for sale, may be seen all the latest novels in vogue anil most of the standard works which, in spite of, or perhaps ill consequence of, their ancient fame, still find readers. Rooks are published at much lower prices in Paris than in London. Lending libraries are now quite out of date in the French capital, and persons really interested in a new work if. imt get it to read at so much a volume or a subscription of so much a year, hut buy it once and for all. Forty or fifty years ago the circulating library system had been pushed further in Paris than any point it has yet reached in London. Novels by popular authors were issued in six or eight volumes with from eighty to one hundred words in each page; a sore temptation to the Belgian pirates, who, ill the days before International Copyright Conven tions, vexed the -mil of every French author by reproducing his works at so low a price that he bail no more chance of selling his editions in"], [144, "124 PARIS, OLD AND NEW [The Boulevards.

It was impossible to prevent the fraudulent imitations of Belgium entering Convention which binds all other countries with the exception of Russia and Holland on one sitle of the Atlantic, and the United States of America on the other. To offer new books for sale in London strangely high prices fixed for the benefit of the circulating libraries would be out of the ques. tion ; but at the Librairie Nouvelle all the latest works prodtu Paris may be seen, partialh and finally, if such he the desire of the reader, purchased. Many a Parisian, however, or visitor to Paris, whether from love of litera ture or merely to pass the time, strolls into the Librairie Nouvelle and looks through book after book without buying a single volume. Some day such an instituti this will possibly exist in London; not, however, until the prices ol our new books are considerably lowered. But although tli quenters of the Librairie Nouvelle are not called upon, or even ex pected, to make purchases, only a small fraction of them leave the establishment without doing so; and it is as astonishing as it is interesting to see with what rapidity copies of a new novel ol genuine popularity will sometimes go off.

The end of the Boulevard des Italiens Is marked by a circular pavilion, which h. something of its original shape through the repairs necessitated by the ravages of time ; though it still bears a number of sculptural ornaments which arc much admired, incl certain masks, reputed to be masterpieces. It is called the Pavilion of Hanover, and is so named from having been erected and adorned bv the architect Chevcautel for the Due de Richelieu at the end of the garden attached to his mansion, after the campaign of Hanover, in 17:7, which he terminated by securing the capitulation of Closterseven. Under the Directory and the Consulate, in the first years of the Empire, the Pavilion of Hanover and a portion of the gn belonging formerly to the Due dc Richelieu were the scene of public assemblies, hall concerts ; and it was here that Tortoni established his famous ice-shop and cafe in partnership with another Italian, named Velloni. The latter is now forgotten ; but Tortoni, who continued the business on bis own account, is, in the world of cafes, an historical figure. (In the first floor of the house of which the ground-floor is occupied by the Librairie Nou velle, we find the Club of tbe Two Worlds, or \"Cercle des Deux Mondes,\" established in an abode which was occupied for some time by the Jockey Club, until this latter, after deserting the mansion built bv the F armer -General de Lange 011 the Boulevard Montmartre, continued its western progress, to reach ultimately the domi cile it at pic-sent inhabits on the Boulevard des Capucines.

It was in the character of architect that Belanger first became acquainted with the brilliant and witty actress ; and when he made her an offer of marriage, which she did not accept, she at once observed that no one was better fitted than an architect to build up her damaged reputation. From the family of Brancas the mansion erected by Belanger passed to the wife of General Rapp, then to the Marchioness of Hertford, to her son Lord Seymour, and to Sir Richard Wallace.

His desire was to live only for me, and that I should live only for him. This last idea particularly dis pleased me. I might have been content to be restrained by a garland of flowers, but could not bear to be confined by a chain. I saw from that moment the necessity of destroying the flattering hope which nourishes attachment and of dis allowing his frequent visits.

Afterwards, when the young man had partly recovered, Mile.

Clairon, \" passed between our first acquaintance and his death. He entreated me to assuage the last moments of his life by repairing to his bed-side.

The first building on the Boulevard Capucines at the opposite corner ofthe Cha d'Antin is the Vaudeville Theatre, built to re place the old playhouse on the Place de la Bourse, and opened to the public on the istol October, 1867. Anciently this theatre to be placed beneath the auspices of Coll Augiers and Scribe, whose names mark different phases of the Vaudeville style, once exch cultivated by this theatre. Of later years, how ever, especially since the production ot tin younger Dumas' Dame aux Camillas, sorM forty years ago, it has often thrown gaiety\"\" one side for the pathetic and dramatic. The Vaudeville, like all the Paris theatres, h frequently changed its habitation, though it has"], [153, "THE VAUDEVILLE The Boulevards.] 131 always retained its original name. Founded in when the Revolution was approaching the Terrorist period, at a building in the Rue tie Chartres, between the Place du Carrousel and the Palais Royal (since pulled down), the Vaudeville was, after a life of half tt century, driven from its first abode by the usual fire. In the year of the conflagration, it sought a temporary refuge on the Boulevard Bonne- Nouvelle, to move in 1840 to the Place de la Bourse, where it took possession of the house previously occupied by the Opera Comique. Here, where it remained from 1840 to 1867, it changed its style, and instead of comedies and comediettas interspersed with songs, produced with immense success a series of dramas of the most moving kind, such as the already named Dilute aux Camillas, Octave Feuillet's Dalila and Roman dun jcitnc Homme pauvre, Barriere's Filles de Marbre, Sardou's Nos Intimcs and Maison neiire. It is not indeed at the Theatre Francais, but at the Vaudeville and the Gym- that in modern times the masterpieces of French dramatic literature have been pro duced. The first representation of La Dame aux Camillas forms a turning point in the history of the Vaudeville Theatre. The play \u2014 which was soon to become celebrated throughout France, and in its operatic form, set to music by Verdi, throughout Europe \u2014 was not produced without serious objections on tlie part of the censorship ; ami it was only through the intercession of the Duke de Morny, Napoleon III.'s unacknowledged brother and chief adviser, that permission to represent the piece was obtained. When the performance at ok place, the success of the drama, owing a good deal to the pathetic acting of Mme. Doche in the part of the heroine, was marvellous ; and it was made the occasion of innumerable articles in all the French journals at this period, not only on the play and on the novel from the same pen whence the play was derived, but on the unhappy young woman whose life and death tbe author had more or less faithfully depicted in the leading character. To ihat light-minded Frenchmen were not . apable of being moved by the tragic end of the fascinating Marie Duplessis, it may be mentioned that our own Charles Dickens was as touched by it as the numerous French writers, who, more or less perfectly, have put their feelings on the subject into literary form. \"Not man) days after I left,\" writes Mr. Forster, in his \"Life of Dickens,\" under date of 1S47, \" all Paris was crowding to the sale of a lady of the demi-monde, Marie Duplcssis, who had led the most brilliant and abandoned of lives, and left behind her the most exquisite furniture and the most voluptuous and sumptuous bijouterie. Dickens wished at one time to have pointed the moral of this life and death, of which there was great talk in Paris while we were together. The e of satiety, which, only less often than hunger, passes for a broken heart, had killed her. ' What do you want ? ' asked the most famous of the Paris physicians, at a loss for her exact complaint. At last she answered, ' To see my mother.' She was sent for, and there came a simple Breton peasant woman, clad in the quaint garb of her province, who prayed by her bed. until she died.\" The Dame aux Camillas called into ex istence a whole series of pieces, produced either at the Vaudeville or at the Gymnase, in which the true character of women in certain difficult positions was treated controversially, with ex amples in support of arguments ; and at this moment the last kind of play one would expect to see at the Vaudeville is precisely that to which the theatre owes its name. The situation of this theatre in the most fr.shionable, most frequented part of the boulevard renders it, apart from its own special attractions, the fav ourite resort of foreigners living at the excellent hotels in this neighbourhood. The house, with its 1,300 seats, is only of moderate size, but it is much more commodious than the old theatre of the Place de la Bourse. The theatres of Paris, generally, are, indeed, far less commodious than those of London. The Parisians will go anywhere and submit to any discomfort in order to see good acting and a good play. In England we are much more par ticular ; and the narrow ill-ventilated theatres of Paris would certainly be objected to by English audiences. The Paris theatres, however, are steadily improving, as one by one they get burnt down ; and the new ones springing from the ashes of the old are often attractive without and convenient within. In the ancient days before the (ireat Revolution, the Parisians were as passionately fond of the theatre as they are now, but their playhouses, according to the author of \" Le nouveau Paris,\" were abominable. \" I shall say nothing of the mistiness,\" he writes, \"that distinguishes these places of general resort, because I would not wish to injure the property of the comedians ; nor shall I inveigh against the insolence of the box-keepers, and"], [154, "[The Boulevudi i ;: PARIS, OLD AND NEW. other servants of our theatre-, as it would give to the world a bad opinion of the proprietors themselves, to whom some censorious readers might apply the proverb, 'Like master like man,' and think it a truism.

First let us survey the pit. Here everybody stands. You will imagine that its inhabitants are the formidable umpires of taste and dramatic productions ; this may or may not be, just as it suits the caprices of the police, or the Lords of the Bedchamber, who, from making the master's bed, have raised themselves by degrees to judge of things which they hardly understand. Hence an actress is palmed upon the public. Whether she is good or bad is not the question, but whether she has had the good fortune to please one or the whole of those gentlemen ; and everyone knows what price she has paid for her admission. Not a play is represented here without a guard of thirty men with a few rounds each to quiet the spectators. I his internal guard keeps the frequenters of the pit in a kind of passive condition ; and whether you are tired, crowded, or bruised, beware of giving any sign of uneasiness or discontent. Yet the unfortunate public pays to take, not what is mournfully dull. If you venture to gh sign of your existence, you are collared by oneol the guards and carried pro forma before a Com missionaire.

The judgment of connoisseurs may correct mine if I am wrong. The Opera ot Paris passes in the capital for the most pompous, tbe nu .st voluptuous, the most admirable spectacle that human art has ever invented. Its admirers declare it to be the most superb monument of the magnificence of Louis XIV., and one is not so free as you may think to express an opinion on such an important subject. Here you may dispute about everything except music and the Opera ; on these topics alone it is dangerous not to dissemble. French music is defended, too, by a very rigorous inquisition, and the first thing intimated as a warning to strangers who visit this country is that all foreigners admit there is nothing in this world so fine as the Opera of Paris. The fact is, discreet people hold their tongues, and dare only laugh in their sleeves.\" \" The theatre is, moreover, furnished with little square traps, which, opening at need, announce that the demons are about to issue from their cave.

Rousseau then, speaking in the person of St. Preiiz, the hero of \" La nouvelle Hedoise,\" describes the performance as it took place at the Opera. \"Imagine,\" be says, \"an enclosure fifteen feet broad, and long in proportion ; this enclosure is the theatre. On its two sides are placed at intervals screens, which are crudely painted with the objects which the scene is about to represent. At the back of the en closure hangs a great curtain, painted in like manner and nearly always pierced and torn that it may represent at a little distance gulfs on the earth or holes in the sky. Everyone who behind this stage or touches the curtain produces a sort of earthquake which has a double effect. The sky is made of certain bluish rags suspended from poles or cords, as linen may be seen hung out to dry in any washerwoman's yard. The sun, which is here sometimes seen, is a lighted torch in a lantern. The cars of the gods and goddesses are composed of four rafters squared and hung on a thick rope in the form of a swing or see-saw ; between the rafters is a cross plank on which the god sits down, and in front hangs a piece of coarse cloth, well dirtied, which acts the part of clouds for the magnificent car. One may see, towards the bottom of the machine, two or three stinking candles, badly snuffed, which, while the great personage de mentedly presents himself swinging in his see-saw, fumigate him with an incense worthy of his dignity, The agitated sea is composed of \" Such, my cousin, is the august machinery of the Opera, as I have observed it from the pit, with the aid of my glass, for you must not imagine that all this apparatus is hidden, and produces an imposing effect.

I am assured, how ever, that there are a prodigious number of machines employed to put the whole spectacle in motion, and I have been invited several times to examine them ; but I have nevei curious to learn how little things are performed by great means.\" When our musical historian, Dr. Burner. visited Paris and heard at the < ipera the of Rameau, successor to Lulli, under wh\"* direction the French Opera was founded, he found the music monotonous in the extreme, and without either rhythm or expression. He could admire nothing at the French Opera except the dancing and the decor. il these alone, he says, seemed to give pleasure to the audience. It was not, at that time the custom in France to name the singers in the programme ; and throughout the eighteenth century no singer in France attained suen"], [157, "THE OPERA HOUSE. The Boulevards.] 135 eminence as was reached by numbers in Italy, and by not a few in England, some of Italian, some of English birth. Naturally, then, in the eighteenth century French Opera singers were not well paid ; and chroniclers relate that a Mile. Aubry and a Mile. Verdier, being 1 in the same line of stage business, had to live in tbe same room and sleep in the same bed. Apart from the obscurity naturally re sulting from the suppression of the names, in convenience was caused by the uncertainty in which the public found itself of knowing which singer, on any particular evening, would appear. Shortly before the establishment of the Republic, when, for the first time, the a young man, was one of the first admirers of the afterwards famous Mme. St. Hubert; ; and when Mme. Mara refused an engagement pressed upon her at the time of the Empire, Napoleon would have arrested her and forced her to accept it had she not fled from Paris. Then, another cause of improvement at the French Opera was the frequent visits paid, early in this century, and especially since the Peace of 1815, by foreign artists to the capital which, in former days, had set its face both against vocalists and composers from abroad. Lulli, the founder ol opera in France, was an Italian by birth, though names of singers were printed in the bills, an habitue rushed out of the theatre in a high state of indignation, and began to betit one of the money-takers in the lobby. The poor man at once under stood the reason of his aggressor's wrath. \"How was I to know,\" he exclaimed, \"that they would let Le Ponthieu sing to-night ! \" The initial step towards high melody at the French Opera was taken when, some fifteen years before the Revolution, first Gluck, then Piccini, were invited to Paris to produce adaptations of former successes, or original works, fitted in either case to French libretti. While praising the melody of the Italians as much as he condemns the solemnity of the French, Rousseau expresses the highest admiration for the genius ,,t Gluck, the great reformer of the French operatic stage. After the arrival of Gluck in Paris Rousseau is said never ONE OF THE DOMES OF THE OPERA HOUS1 to have missed a representation of Orp/ie'e. id, moreover, in reference to the gratifica tion which that work had afforded him, that ''after all there was something in life worth living for, since in two hours so much genuine pleasure could be obtained.\" ient assistance to the French , and this a permanent one, was given by the Republic, through the establishment of i music-school, known as ihe Conservatoire, where a course of gratuitous instruction is given to till comers capable at the stipulated age of g the indispensable test examination. Before, however, the Conservatoire, destined to produce so many excellent vocalists, instru mentalists, and composers, had time to bear fruit, Napoleon had done much to encourage and develop French musical art. Napoleo after his naturalisation he got to be looked upon as a Frenchman. His successor, Rameau, was no doubt a Frenchman. But the French tra dition was so completely broken by the advent of Gluck and Piccini that the French have never since exhibited any of their ancient prejudice against foreign composers ; and it is to these that for the last seventy or eighty years the Grand Opera of Paris has owed most of its success, that is to say, to Spontini, Rossini, Donizetti, Yerdi, and, above all, Meyerbeer. A highly interesting account of the rehearsals of Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable \u2014 one of the typical works of the modern repertoire of grand opera\u2014 is given, in his \" Memoires d'un Bour- de Paris,\" by Dr. .

The chief copyist was making the necessary changes and suppressions in the score ; and the public at least never found fault with the words and music that were now suppressed. But when a director has prepared, like a good general, everything necessary tor the success of the work on the stage, his troubles begin with the front of the bouse. Everyone wants something from him on tbe occasion of a first representation ; and that of Robert le Diable was exciting public interest to the highest degree.

No one any dances there unless paid to do so. It ii fact, the introduction of hired dancers when the public were just beginning to show a disinclination to take an active part in the revels that put an end to spontaneous dancing ther. The antics of some of the hired dancers may interest for a time ; and the music ofthe large orchestra, conducted successively by 1, Tolbecque, Strauss, Metra, and Arban, Ways merited a hearing. Throughout the Carnival \u2014 that is to say, from Christmas until Lent \u2014 a masked and fancy dress ball (the wearing both of masks and fancy dress being optional) is given every week at the Opera, where the great ball of the year takes place on the night of Shrove Tuesday, the day preceding Lent. ther ball of the same kind is given in the middle ot Lent \u2014 la Mi-, are me as it is called \u2014 and thenceforward there is no dancing at the < Ipera until Christmas has once more come and gone. tion of horse-owners and -others interested in racing, who frame regulations and decide cases in connection with the Turf. The Jockey Club of Paris, while founded on much the same basis as the English institution of the same name, is also a club in the ordinary sense of the word, and an exceedingly good one. The Jockey Club, which boasts of numbering on its books members of all the reigning families of Europe, is, by its formal title, a \"Society of Encouragement for the Amelioration of Breeds of Horses in France.\" It was originated in 1833, under the auspices of the Duke of Orleans, eldest son of Louis Philippe, in order to popularise racing, regulate it, and obtain for it subsidies from the State and the .Municipalities. A committee of thirteen members is exclusively entrusted with the organisation and superintendence of races. The code of the Jockey Club is adopted as a basis of regulations by nearly all the other racing societies of France. The Jockey Club itself directs the racing of onl) three courses, those of the Bois de Boulogne, Fontainebleau, and Chantilly. This club, first established at the corner ofthe Rue du Helder, and then transferred to the Hotel de Lange on the Boulevard Montmartre, moved in 1857 to the corner of the Rue de Grammont, where the Cercle des Deux Mondes now has its head quarters, and finally, in 1860, to its present abode, for which it pays an annual rental of 100,000 francs. Not one of the Paris clubs seems, like tbe principal London clubs, to possess its own house. As a rule the annual subscription to the Paris club is high, amounting in some cases to -;oo francs. On the other hand, the large sums charged for entrance to the London clubs, ranging from 30 to 40 guineas, are unknown at the clubs of Paris, which consequently find themselves without much available capital. The Opera Ball dates, like the Opera itself, Irom the reign of Louis XIV. But the license for musico-dramatic performances had been forty years before it occurred to the Chevalier de Bouillon to apply to the King for permission to give masked balls. The King hastened to grant the Chevalier's request ; and was indeed so pleased with it that he assigned to hint a pension of 6, 000 livres (francs) for the Inch had simply been borrowed. What is still more remarkable is the fact that an Augustine monk, Nicholas Bourgeois, invented the mechanism by which, in half an hour, the if the auditorium could be raised to the level of the stage hoards. Although the privi- r patent was given to the Chevalier de Bouillon at the beginning of January, 1713, it ot until January, 1716, that the first opera ball took place. From that year until 1830110 1 or fancy dress ball could be given at any theatre. On the accession, however, of Philippe, the Opera lost its dancing monopoly, and there are now numbers of Paris theatres at which, during the Carnival, masked bulb occur. The receipts at an Opera Ball are -0,000 francs ( y7,ooo ). \u25a0 a lie all the fashionable clubs niig with the Jockey Club at the Close to the Opera, on the Boulevard des Italiens, at the corner of the Rue de Grammont, is Le Cercle des Deux Mondes ; at the corner of the Rue de la Michodiere, the Railway Club, or Cercle des Chemins de Fer ; on the Boulevard des Capucines, at the corner of the Rue Louis le- Grand, the Yacht Club. Just opposite the Yacht Club \" Le Cercle de la Presse,\" celebrated for its literary and artistic evenings, suggests in the first place that no like institution exists in England, where the newspaper world, though less sharply broken up by political anil pi animosities than that of France, is bound to gether by no such esprit de corps as that which animates the authors ami journalists of France.

The 'aris clubs have private carriages always in readiness. At a London club members who have not their own private carriage content them selves with a hansom, or, if infirm, with a humble first representation, which are distributed among the members according to the order of applica tion.

[The Bl 142 at least to Englishmen \u2014 is that every member is supposed to know, more or less intimately, every other member.

Though there are still famous restaurants in Paris, dining-houses and cafes have alike suffered bv the introduction of clubs, which, though fewer as yet than in London, are yearly increasing their number. ddie last of the boulevards on the western side is that of the Madeleine, with the Church of the Madeleine as its principal edifice. The Place de la Madeleine, in the centre of which stands the beautiful but most unecclesiastical church, becomes twice every week, on Tuesday and Friday, a large flower-market, the finest in Paris. Standing by itself in the place named after it, is the beautiful Greek temple, of which the first stone was laid, in one of his pious moods, by Louis XY. in 1704. But the build ing was not proceeded with until after a delay of some years. It was begun in its present form only twelve years before the Revolution ; and when Napoleon became emperor it was still unfinished. Judging, no doubt, from the character of the architecture, that the edifice could scarcely have been intended for a place of Christian worship, Napoleon had it finished as a Temple of Glory under the direction of the celebrated architect Pierre Vignon. Like the Pantheon, however, which has sometimes been thus named, and at other times called the Church of Sainte - Genevieve, Napoleon's Temple of Glory was only for a time to be known in that character. Under the Restoration, in 1 8 14, Louis XYIII. determined to restore the building to the Chufch ; and, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene, it was duly consecrated. La Made leine, as it is called, was, however, still uncompleted when, in 1830, Louis Philippe came to the throne ; and it was under his reign that, in 1842, it was opened for public worship in the precise form and with the elaborate ornamentation now belonging to it. The architecture of the Madeleine is partly Roman, partly Greek ; or rather it is Greek with Roman adaptations. It is surrounded by Corinthian columns, of which there are eighteen on each side. Sixteen, moreover, enclose the southern portion, and eight the northern. The building is without windows, and is entirely of stone. The nichea in the colonnade are occupied by thirty-four statues representing the most venerated martyrs and saints. On the principal facade will be remarked a high - relief of huge dimensions by Lemaire, representing our Lord as of the world. The figure of the Saviour i5 seventeen feet high. On His right are the Angel of Salvation and the saved; on Hi- lei; the Angel of Punishment and the condemned, with Mary Magdalene interceding on their behalf. The interior is brilliant with gold and colour. The sanctuary, with its vaulted roof, exhibits a vast fresco by Zugler, representing i he history of Christianity. Mary Magdalene, re ceiving Christ's forgiveness, is surrounded by the Apostles and Evangelists ; and among the illus trious men who in successive ages have protected the Christian Church may be recognised Con stantine, Godefroi de Bouillon, Clovis, Joan of Arc, Dante, and Napoleon. Tbe principal altar supports an enormous group in white marble, generally known as the Assumption, though the central figure is that of Mary Magdalene. The Assumption in this case is that of Mary \\ lene into Paradise, whither she is being borne by two angels. Under the organ is the Chapelle des Manages, with a marble group by Pradier, representing the marriage of the Virgin ; and the Chapelle des Fonts, with a group by Rude, the subject being the Baptism of Christ. To the right of the altar we see illustrated the of Christianity in the East during the early centuries and the Crusades ; and again, in modern times, through the uprising ot the Greeks against the Turks. As leading Crusaders, Richard Cceur-de-Lion and Godefroi de Bouillon occupy places. The personages exhibited as having greatly contributed towards the pro gress of Christianity in the West are the early martyrs, Charlemagne, Pope Alexander III., Joan of Arc, Raphael, Michael Angelo, and Dante. In the centre of the picture stands Henri IV., who, after uttering his celebrated exclamation, \" Paris is well worth a mass, over to tbe dominant religion. Then come Louis XL1!., Richelieu, and finally Napoleon I., who not only was crowned by Pope Pius \\ II in Notre-Dame, but really deserves credit for having restored Christian worship in France. In the first chapel, on the right as one enters tbe church, is a pillar bearing an inscription to the memory of the Abbe du Guerry, cure of the Madeleine, a man of remarkable piety and benevolence, who, with other h"], [165, "THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE. levards.^ 143 taken by the Communists, was shot on the 24th of May. 1871, in retaliation for the execution of Communist prisoners by the troops of Ver sailles. ddie Church of the Madeleine is famous for the eloquence of its preachers, the taste ill dress. of the fashionable ladies whom these preachers attract, and the excellence of the music.

The King, on his side, presented to the city a large open piece of ground at the end of the Tuileries Gardens, and in the centre of this plain the first stone was laid of the monument which was to celebrate the virtues of Louis the Well-beloved. This statue, according to the fashion of the time, represented the King in Roman costume with a crown of laurels on his head ; and, among other devices, personifica tions of Strength, Wisdom, Justice, and Peace were made to figure at the corners of the pedestal, which gave rise to the following epi gram : \u2014 \"Oh ! la belle statue ! oh ! fe beau piedestal ! Les vertus sont u pied, le vice est ii cheval ; \" which may be thus turned into English : \u2014 \" Fit statue, fitter pedestal ! with laughter burst your sides, The virtues all below on foot, while vice triumphant rides ! \" Another satirist wrote : \u2014 \" II est ici comme a Versailles ; II est sans c\u0153ur et sans entrailles.\" or, to give something like an equivalent in English : \u2014 \" Here have set up the builders with their trowels A King of brass who 's neither heart nor bowels.\" d'he Place tie la Concorde, the finest of the many fine squares and open spaces in Paris, an area of 400 yards in length, by 235 yards in width.

Then, to prove that his fireworks were harmless, he let ofl three or four ofthem in presence of the princes, which quite destroyed the suspicions formed against him. Everyone now began to laugh. Much trepidation had meanwhile been caused by a very trifling incident. The next incident of importance which took place on the great Place was important indeed. It was nothing less than the destruction of Louis XY.'s statue, which on the nth of Ai I7Q2, the day after the capture of the Tuileries, was removed by order of the Legislate seinblv, melted down, and converted into pieces of two sous. The statue of the king \\. placed by a statue of Libertv, which, being made in terra-cotta, was called by the anti-Revolu tionists the \"Liberty of Mud.\" The Plao now named Place de la Revolution. Place de la Guillotine it might more fitly have been called, for it was here that the instrument of punish ment, of vengeance, and often of simple hatred, was erected, to begin its horrid work, on the :ist of January, 1703, by the decapitation of Louis XVI. But let us return to the year 1770 and the fete on the Place Louis XV. All was going well, when suddenly a gust of wind blew down among the crowd some rockets only partially exploded. Fireworks, like so many inventions of Italian origin, were still, to tbe mass of the French public, a comparative novelty ; anil this, together with the positive inconvenience and even danger of a fall of blazing missiles in the midst of thousands of excited and closely-packed spectators, was quite enough to account tor the terrible confusion, resulting in many hundreds of fatal accidents, which now ensued. There was, in tbe first place, a general rush towards the Rue Royale, far too narrow to re ceive such an invasion ; and in the crush numbers ..I women fainted, fell, and were trampled to death. To make matters worse the stream of persons pressing into the Rue Royale was met by a counter-stream, advancing, in ignorance of what had taken place, to the Place de la Concorde. Even these, who were not in imminent peril, were now affected by a panic which soon became universal. In the midst of shrieks and groan -I une desperate men drew their swords and endeavoured to cut for themselves a passage through the dense mass by which they were surrounded. \" I know many persons,\" says Mercier, in his \"Tableau de Paris,\" \" who thirty months after these frightful scenes still bore the marks of objects which had been crushed into them. Some lingered on for ten years and then died. I may sav without exaggeration that in the general panic and crush more than twelve hundred unfortunate persons lost their lives. One entire family disappeared ; and there w as scarcely a household which had not to lament the death of a relative or friend.\" On the other hand the official returns put down the deaths at 1 ;;, already an immense number. The unhappy monarch had been bri along the whole line of boulevards from the prison of the Temple, close to the Place de la Bastille, at one extremity, to the Place dt la Revolution at the other. These two op] points mark in a certain way the beginning and tbe end of the Revolution. Its first heroic act was the taking of the Bastille ; the cruel deeds which marked its close had for their scene the former Place Louis XV., which the Revolution had now named after itself. The last moments of Louis XVI. have often been described, but never in so simple, ton. and direct a manner as by the Abbe Edgeworth, who accompanied the king to the scaffold, anil at the fatal moment was by bis side. He after wards wrote in the French language an account of what he bad witnessed, from which some of the most striking passages may here be repro duced. \"The fate of the king,\" he says, \"was undecided, when M. dc Malesherbes. to whom 1 had not the honour of being personally known and who could neither ask me to his hou come to mine, requested me to meet lum at Mme. de Senosan's house, where I accordingly Seven years later, in 1777, the Place Louis"], [169, "LOUIS XVI. 147 Place de la Concorde.) waited on him. There M. de Malesherbes delivered to me a message from the king sig nifying the wish of that unfortunate monarch that I should attend him in bis last moments, if the atrocity of his subjects should be con- I with nothing less than his death. This ge was conveyed in terms which I should have thought it my duty to suppress if they did not demonstrate the excellence of the prince end I am going to relate. He carried the delicacy of his expressions so far as to ask as a favour the services he had a right to demand from me as a duty. He claimed them as the last of my attachment. He hoped that I would not refuse him. He added that if the danger to which I must be exposed should appear to me too great he would beg me to name another clergy man, ddiis was not to be thought of, and on being admitted to the prison L fell at the king's feet without the power of utterance. The king was much moved, but soon began to answer my tears with his own.'' down on his bed. At five o'clock he rose and dressetl as usual. Soon afterwards he sent tor me, and 1 attended him for nearly tin hour in the cabinet, where he had received me the evening before. I found an altar completely prepared in the King's apartment. The commis saries had executed to tbe letter everything that I had required of them. They bad even done more than I had asked, I having only demanded what was indispensable. The King heard Mass. He knelt on the ground without cushion or desk. He then received the Sacrament, after which ceremony I left him for a short time at his prayers. He soon sent for me again, and I found him seated near bis stove, where he could scarcely warm himself. ' My God,' said he, 'how happy I am in the possession of my* religious principles ! Without them what should I now be? But with them how sweet death appears to me ! Yes, there dwells on high an uncorruptible Judge from Whom I shall re ceive the justice refused to me on earth !' The sacred offices I performed at this time prevent my relating more than a few sentences out of many interesting conversations which the King held with me during tbe last sixteen hours of his life ; but by the little that I have told it may be seen how much might be added if it were con sistent with my duty to say more. Day began to dawn, and the drums sounded in all the quarters of Paris. An extraordinary movement was heard in the tower \u2014 it seemed to freeze the blood in my veins. But the King, more calm than I was, after listening to it for a moment, said to me without emotion: 'It is probably the National Guard beginning to assemble.' In a short time detachments of cavalry entered the court of the Temple, and the voices of officers and the trampling of horses were dis tinctly heard. The King listened again and said to me with the same composure : ' They seem to be approaching.' On taking leave of the < Hieen the evening before be had promised to see her again next day, and he wished ear nestly to keep his word ; but I entreated him not to put the Queen to a trial under which she must sink. He hesitated a moment, and then, with an expression of profound grief, said : 'You are right, sir, it would kill her. I must deprive myself of this melancholy consolation and let her indulge in hope a few moments longer.' From seven o'clock till eight various persons came frequently, under different pre tences, to knock at the door of the cabinet, and each time I trembled lest it should be the last. A high official from whom the Abbe Edge worth had requested permission to administer the Sacrament replied that he deemed the request of the Abbe and that of Louis Capet conformable to the law, which declared all forms ot worship to be free. \" Nevertheless,\" added Micial, \"there are two conditions. The first is that you draw up instantly an address containing your demand signed by yourself; the .1. that your religious ceremonies be con ehided by 7 o'clock to-morrow at latest, for at 8 .mis Capet must set out for the place \"I execution.\" \"These last words,\" writes the Abbe, \"were ike all the rest, with a degree of cold- 1 indifference which characterised an atrocious mind.

These apprehended mur murs were not imaginary. A great numbi people devoted to the King had resolved mi tear ing him from the hands of his guards, or, at least, of making the attempt. Two of the principal actors, young men whose names are well known, found means to inform me, the night befi their intentions ; and though my hopes were not sanguine, I yet did not despair of n even at the foot of the scaffold. I have heard that the orders for this dreadful moi had been planned with so much art, and cuted with so much precision, that, ol si five hundred people thus devoted to their prince twenty-five only succeeded in reaching appointed rendezvous. In consequence' i measures taken before daybreak in all the- streets of Paris, none of the rest were able to gi of their houses. The King, finding himself seated in a carriage where he could neither speak to me nor be spoken to without witness, kept a profound silence. I presented him with my breviary, the only book I had with me, and he seemed to accept it with pleasure. He ap peared anxious that I should point out to him the psalms that were best suited to his situation, and he recited them attentively with me. The gendarmes, without speaking, seeme and confounded at the tranquil piety of their monarch, to whom, doubtless, they had never before approached so near. The pr\u00bb lasted almost two hours.

His Majesty did not answer a word, but returned to me, contenting himself with saying, 'See how these people treat me. But I know how to endure every thing.' Another time, after having answered one of the commissaries who came to interrupt us. he returned and said, with a smile, 'These people see poignards and poison everywhere ; they fear that I shall destroy myself. Alas! they little know me. To kill myself would indeed be weakness. No, since it is necessary, I know bow I ought to die!' We heard another knock at the door-- destined to be the last. It was Santerre and his crew. Tbe King opened the door as usual. They announced to him 1 1 could not bear in what terms) that he must prepare for death. 'I am occupied,' said he, with an air of authority. 'Wait lor me. In a few minutes 1 will return to you.' Then, having shut the door, he knelt at my feet. 'It is finished, sir,' he said. 'Give me your last benediction, anil pray that it may please God to support me to the end.' He soon arose, and, leaving the cabinet, advanced towards the wretches who were in his bedchamber. Their countenances were embarrassed, yet tbeir bats were imt taken off. And the King, perceiving it, asked for bis own. Whilst Clery, bathed in tears, nui for it, the King saitl, ' Arc there amongst you any members of tbe Commune? I charge them to take care of this paper.' It was bis will. One ofthe party took it from the King. 'I recommend also to the Commune Clery my valet. I can only congratulate myself on having bad bis services. Give him my watch and clothes, not only these I have here, but those that have been deposited at the Com mune.

The guards insisted ; they raised their voices, and seemed to wish to call on others to aid them. \"Perhaps this was the most terrible moment of the direful morning ; another instant and the best of kings would have received from his rebellious subjects indignities too horrid to mention\u2014 indignities that would have been to him more insupportable than death. Such was the feeling expressed on his countenance. Turning towards me, he looked at me steadily, as if to ask my advice. Alas ! it was impossible for me to give any, and I only answered by silence ; but as he continued this fixed look of inquiry I replied, 'Sir, in this new insult I only see another trait of resemblance between your Majesty and the Saviour who is about to re compense you.' At these words he raised bis eyes to heaven with an expression that can never be described. ' You are right,' be said, ' nothing less than His example should make me submit to such a degradation.' Then, turning to the guards, he addetl : ' Do what you will. I will drink of the cup even to the dregs.' The path leading to the scaffold was extremely rough and difficult to pass. The king was obliged to lean on my arm, and from tbe slowness with which he proceeded I feared for a moment that his ge might fail ; so that my astonishment was extreme when, arrived at the last step, he sud denly let go my arm and I saw him cross with a firm si 11 >t the breadth ofthe whole scaffold ; silence, bv hi- look alone, fifteen or twenty drums that were placed opposite to him ; and in a voice so loud, that it must have been heard at the Pont Tournant, pronounce distinctly these memorable words : ' I die innocent of all the crimes laid to my charge ; I pardon those who have occasioned my death ; and I pray to God that the blood you are now going to shed may never be visited on France.' He was proceeding, when a man on horseback, in the national uniform, waved his sword, and with a ferocious cry ordered the drums to beat. Many voices were at the same time heard encouraging the executioners. They seemed to have re-animated themselves, and seizing with violence the most virtuous of kings, they dragged him under the axe of the guillotine, which with one stroke severed his head from his body. All this passed in a moment. The youngest of the guards, who seemed about eighteen, immediately seized the head and showed it to tbe people, as he walked round the seats dd. He accompanied this monstrous cere mony with tbe most atrocious and indecent \"It is remarkable,\" writes Mr. Sneyd worth, the Abbe's brother, \" that in this account of the last moments of Louis XVI., th, Edgeworth has omitted to relate that tine apostrophe, which everyone has heard, and which everyone believes that he addressed to his king at the moment of execution \u2014 \" ' Fils de St. Louis, montez au ciel ! ' \"The Abbe- Edgeworth has been asked if he recollected to have made this exclamation. He replied that he could neither deny nor affirm that he bad spoken the words. It was possible, he added, that he might have pronounced them without afterwards recollecting the fact, for that he retained no memory of anything which happened relative to himself at that awful instant. His not recollecting or recording the winds is perhaps the best proof that they were spoken from the impulse ofthe moment.\" The Reign of Terror had now begun. Foreign armies were marching towards Paris in order lu liberate the King from prison and replace lum on his throne. The Republican Government replied by removing the head of the monarch whom it was prepared to restore. During the Reign of Terror the Place de la Concorde, as it was afterwards to be called, might fitly have been named, not merely the l'i the Revolution, the title it bore, but the I'l Blood. In the terrible year of 1703 Charlotte Corday was guillotined on the 17th of July ; Brissot, leader of the Girondists, with twenty-one of his followers, on tbe 2nd of October ; Queen Marie Antoinette on the 16th of October ; and Philippe tfgalite, Duke of Orleans (father of Louis Philippe), on the 14th of November. Among the victims of tbe year 1704 may be mentioned Madame Elizabeth, sister of Louis XVI., who was guillotined on the 12th of May ; Hebert and several of his most bloodthirsty associates, who, at the instigation of Robespierre and Danton, lost their heads on the 14th of March , and members of bis party, who followed a few days afterwards; Danton himself and a number of his adherents, with the heroic Camih moulins among them, on the Nth of April ; Chau mette and Anacharsis Cloots, together with the wives of some previous victims, on April nth \u2022"], [173, "THE REIGN OF TERROR.

Of those who suffered under the Revolu tion, many, such as Robespierre, Danton, and Marat, well deserved their fate, and none more so than the infamous Philippe Egalite, who, after playing the part of a democrat, and democrat ically voting for the death of his cousin the king, was himself, on democratic grounds, brought to the guillotine. One of the most eminent figures in the Gi rondist partv, Lasource, exclaimed to his san guinary judges, on receiving his sentence: \"I die at a moment when the people have lost their 1 ; you will die the day they regain it.\" In reference to Saint-Just's arrogance, Camille iitlins had said : \" He carries his head with as much veneration as though he were bearing the Church Sacrament on his shoulders;\" to which Saint-Just playfully replied : \" And I will make him carry his head as St. Denis carried bis.\" St. Denis, the martyr, it will be remembered, is said, after decapitation, to have marched some distance with his head under his arm. Writing in the Revue des Deux Mondes four years after Louis Philippe's election to the throne, Chateaubriand reproached the reigning king with being the son of a regicide. Arguing that since the execution of Louis XVI., and as a punishment for that crime, it had become im possible to establish monarchy in France, Cha teaubriand added : \" Napoleon saw the diadem fall from his brow in spite of his victories ; Charles X. in spite of his piety. To discredit the crown finally in the eyes of the nations, it has been permitted to the son of the regicide to be for one moment in the blood-stained bed of the murderer.\" That Louis Philippe suffered this outburst to be published unchallenged has been regarded as a proof of his extreme tolerance in press matters. In the course ofthe two years over which the Reign of Terror extended (though its duration is variously estimated according to the political principles ofthe calculator) nearly 3,000 persons are declared to have perished on the Place de la Revolution ; though this estimate would certainly he regarded by some as excessive, by others as mate. In reference to the Reign of Terror, Victor calls upon the world \" not to criticise too closely the bursting of the thunder-cloud which had been slowly gathering for eighteen centu ries ; \" as though, from the earliest period, France had always been grossly misgoverned, to be sud denly governed in perfection from the time of the Revolution. It is the simple truth, however, that the Reign of Terror was the result, not of the natural development of the Revolutionary but of threats from abroad, the presence, nd imaginary, of foreign agents in Paris, and the advance of the German armies with a view to the liberation of the king and the suppression of the Republic. It ought also in fairness to be remembered that if the Revolutionists made a tree use of the guillotine, they abolished torture and the cruel methods of executions I such as beating to death with an iron bar) in use under the ancient monarchy until tbe moment ofthe outbreak. Nor can it be forgotten that at riods of French history (the Ma Bartholomew is an instance) life bas been ced more copiously, more recklessly, and wantonly, than timing the worst exo French Revolution. When many years afterwards it w.. d to erect a fountain on Probably, however, he thought it prudent not to invite general attention to words which by a large portion of his subjects would have been accepted as true. It has been said by the de fenders of the \"regicide \" that Philippe Egalite did his best not to be present at the sitting of the Convention when sentence had to be passed on the unfortunate king ; and that he was threatened by his friends of the Left with assassination unless he voted with them for the \" death of the tyrant.\" However that may be. he took his seat among the judges by whom the fate of his royal kinsman was to be decided ; and when it came to his turn to deliver his opinion, he did so in these words: \"Occupied solely with my duty, convinced that all those who have attacked or might afterwards attack the sovereignty of the people deserve death, I pronounce the death of Louis.\" Philippe Egalite had looked for general approval, and had voted in fear of that death which awaited him nevertheless, and which came to him in the very form in which a few months before it had been inflicted on the unhappy Louis. When his vote was made known, cries of indignation from all sides warned him that he had transgressed one"], [174, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW.

AT the point where the L long line of boulevards, extending for three miles from the Place de la Bastille to the Madeleine, comes to an end the road bifurcates. ddie Rue Royale leads in one direction towards the Place de la Concorde, the Rue Castiglione in another towards the Place Vend6me, a square, or rather an octa gon, in the middle of which stands the famous column at which the typical French patriot, Le Colonel Chauvin, used to gaze with such enthusiastic admiration. The Place was constructed hy the celebrated architect Mansard. In 1686, on the proposition of Louis XIV.'s minister, Louvois, the for mation of the Place in the marble, might be read pompous inscriptions in honour of his Majesty's victories. This statue remained on its pedestal for nearly a century. But on the ioth of August, 1792, when the Revolutionary fury was reaching its acute stage, the effigy was overturned bv the pie, and the name of Place Vendome changed to Place des Piques. This eminently anarchical title was preserved until the establishment of the Empire, when Napoleon conceived the idea of the column to which the Place Vendome now owes its chief importance. ddie true name of the column in question is the Column of Austerlitz. So, at least, it wtis designated by Napoleon ; though the French pie have persisted in calling it after the place in which it stands. It is a reproduction, as regards form, of the Trajan Column, which, however, is in marble, whereas the Column of the Place Vendome is in stone covered with bronze castings. The column astonishes by its height, and excites admiration by its harmo nious proportions. Few, however, notice the perfection of its details. The stone, of which the monument substantially consists, is covered by 378 sheets of bronze, so perfectly adjusted that the column appears to be one mass of solid metal. On an interminable spiral of low reliefs, the soldiers of the Empire are repre sented with the uniforms they wore, and the arms they carried. The principal personages are portraits, and the scenes represented are all from the campaign of 1805. The scrolls of bronze on which figure the actors and inci dents of the Austerlitz campaign would measure, in one continuous line, more than 2bo metres. Idle column is surmounted by the statue of the man who, in his own honour, erected it, and the base of the statue bears an inscription in these terms : \u2014 \" MONUMENT RAISED TO THE GLORY OF THE GRAND ARMY r.V NAPOLEON IHE GREAT.

Whether from a feeling of shame or of mistrust, the French National Guards were replaced by Russian troops. Launay now raised the statue by means of wedges, and let it down with pulleys, No sooner had the bronze figure touchf ground than it was replaced on tbe summit of the column by the white flag of the old monarchy. \"Then,\" says Launay in tin ac count be has left of the affair, \"erics were heard of 'Long live the Ring!' 'Long live Louis XVIII.!'' This was on April 8th, at six in the evening, the operation having lasted four days, at an expense to the nation of only 4,815 francs 4b centimes. Launay obtained permission to take away the statue and keep it in his workshop as security for the payment of So, 000 francs still due to him from the Government as founder of the column. < In the return of Napoleon from Elba Launay was forced by the Imperial police to give up the statue ; and when, after the Hundred Days, the monarchy was a second time restored, the statue, a masterpiece of Chaudet, was melted down, and the metal used by Lemot for a new equestrian statue of Henri IV.

In [814, the day after the entry of the allied troops into Ran-, it was proposed to pull down the statue of Napoleon, costumed and crowned like a Roman emperor, from its proud position at the top of the Austerlitz Column ; ami with this view a cable was thrown round the Emperor's neck, the lower part of his legs having been previously sawn through so that he might tall with case. The statue, however, Stood firm. The angle at which the engineers were operating did not enable them to pull the statue sufficiently forward ; and to tug at the cable was only to hold it faster to its base. A zealous royalist now came forward in the person of M. de Montbadon, chief of staff to the Paris garrison. Empowered by MM. Polignac and Semallc, commissaries of the Count of Artois, to take whatever measures he might think necessary, M. de Montbadon applied to Launay, who had made the castings for the column and had cast the statue itself. He who had made could also unmake, argued M. de Montbadon. Rut he had reckoned without Launay himself, who refused indig nantly to do the work required of him. Thereupon he was taken to the headquarters, where an order was served upon him in these terms : \" We command the said M.

The more realistic statue was placed in the middle of the rond-point of Courbevoie. I nder the Commune the statue and the column itself were pulled down. The eminent painter, Courbet, had formed a project for re placing the column, which was only a monument of the victories gained by France at the expense went to pieces. The statue, too, suffered greatly by the fall. One of the legs was broken, and the head got separated from the body.

After the suppression of the Commune the Assembly of Versailles ordered the re-establish ment of the Venddme column, which was duly set up in 1875. The interior construction of stone was entirely new. So also, as regards form, was the bronze plating, the scrolls being recast from the moulds preserved since the time of the first Empire.

On the west side of the Place Vendome is the Ministry of Justice. The Hotel du Rhin on the south side was the residence of Napoleon III. when he was a member of the National Assembly in 1848, before his election to the post of President, followed by his self - appointment t<> the dignity, first of President for ten years and a year afterwards of Emperor. In one of his letters ofthe 1.848 period, inviting a friend to dinner at the Hotel du Rhin, he apologised for proposing to entertain him at a \"cabaret,\" a pleasantly contemptuous designation which the commodious and well-appointed Hotel du Rhin scarcely deserved.

The Hotel du Rhin played a certain strategic part towards the end of May, 1871, when on the 23rd the Versailles troops passed through the hotel, and, attacking the insurgents in the rear, captured one of their principal barricades. The proprietor of the hotel, M. Marechal, is said, on the occasion of the Vendome column being threatened by the Communists, to have offered them 500,000 francs if they would spare it. \"Give us a million and we will see ! \" was the answer ; but the patriotic hotel-keeper, though he had the misfortune to see the column knocked down, lived to behold its restoration. \" Mile.

Thereupon she took to flight, when her standard-bearer was also wounded in the leg. He stopped and raised the visor of his helmet in order to pull out the arrow. A second one- was now shot at him, which struck him between the eves and killed him. The prediction of the Maid was not fulfilled on this occasion, for Paris did not surrender. Among the various illustrious persons buried at Saint-Roch may be mentioned Diderot, to whose interment in 17X4, five years before the Revo lution, the clergy seem to have made no ob jection. The statue of Mary Magdalene in the Calvary sculpture reproduces the features of the irss de Feuquieres, cut in white marble by me. This figure originally formed part of the tomb of the Countess's father, Mignard, the celebrated painter, whose bust by Desjardins is oil at Saint-Roch. Here may also be seen medallions of Marshal d'Asfedd, of the Duke de and of Count d'Harcourt ; the Statue of the Duke de Crequi, and the monuments of Maupertuis, the philosopher, and ed\" the be nevolent Abbe de l'Epee. Some time afterwards two women were arrested at Corbeil and thrown into prison at Paris. They accused of believing and saying to everyone that the Maid of Orleans was sent from God ; that Jesus often appeared to her, and that the last time she had seen Him He was clothed in a long white robe with a scarlet cloak above it. The elder of the two women refused to retract, and was consequently, on the 3rd of September, 1430, burnt alive. On the high ground, at some little distance the Church of Saint-Roch, is the Butte Saint-Roch, already referred to as the camping ground of the Maid of Orleans when the king's army was besieging Paris. Since Joan of Arc has sung by great poets, impersonated by great actresses, and set to music by great com- . with Gounod and Verdi among them, all France has admired the warlike heroine ; hut while the Maid of Orleans was striving t the enemies of her country, the Pari- preferred the government of the English to that ofthe lawful inheritor of the French Crown.

He said in the pulpit that from the age of fourteen she had been in the habit of wearing men's clothes ; that her parents would have killed her had they not been afraid of wounding their conscience ; that she quitted her family accompanied by the devil, and became a slayer of Christians ; and that since that time she had committed an infinity of murders ; that in prison she caused herself to be waited on like a lady, and the devils came to her in the form of St. Catherine, St. Marguerite, and St. Michael. He added that, having been frightened into quitting her man's apparel to dress like a woman, the devil made her resume her customary dress, though he did not come to her succour at her execution as she had expected. A Parisian writer quoted by Dulaurc says, in relating ihe incidents of his time, that Joan of Arc was a vicious creature in the form of a d,\" he ironically adds, \"a maid, \u25a0 This monk said moreover in this rcmarkable sermon that there were four Maids: namely, the two taken at Corbeil, one of whom was burnt at Pan.- ; Jeanne d'Arc, burnt at Rouen ; and On the day of the Nativity of the Virgin, 1429,"], [182, "PARIS OLD AND NEW. 160 v'-nd5mc. the fourth, called Catherine de la Rochellc, who followed the army of Charles VII., and who had visions like Joan of Arc.

A pas-ion suddenly arose throughout France for public speaking, and in a thousand different assemblies orators were formed. The States-General had just met; and, not content with the formal sitting-, the deputies loved to address in a direct manner the outside public. With thi- view, the deputies from Brittany established a club called the Breton Club, which wa- joined In other deputies, and which pre sently changed its title to \"Society of the Friends of the Constitution.\" This association included men of all shades of politics, who were afterward- to make war upon one another. Among tin nio-t famous may be- mentioned Sieves, Volney, Barnave, Petion, Barrere, Lameth, Robespierre, the Duke of Orleans (Philippe Egalite), tin Duke de La Rochefoucauld, Boissy d'Anglas, Talleyrand, I. a Fayette, and Mirabeau. flic Societ) had it- head-quarters at Versailles, 111 ,1 building called Le Reposoir, which, later ;m, became a Protestant church. The sitting- were held, first three, then four times a week. Little by little, however, the usual course in such assemblies was drifted into, The leaders went to extremes, and soon the most extravagant ofthem obtained the largest follow ing. Then the moderate members retii form counter-associations, until in time tin hostile organisations made war upon one another, with the guillotine as their final weapon. \"The Jacobins,\" says Michelet, \"by their esprit i/e corps, which went on constantly in creasing, by their r hardened, uncompron faith, by their li.nsh, inquisitorial wa) something of a priestly character. They so a sort of revolutionary clergy.\" Another great admirer of the Revolution, and especially of Robespierre, in whom the principle of Jacobinism was incarnate, sums up the. I. spirit in the following words : \u2014 \"Hatred of the conventional inequalities ut former times, of unalterable beliefs, a sort \"I methodical fanaticism, intolerance of all that interfered with the development of thi daring innovations, and, fundamentally, .1 | for regular forms; these, whatever may bi on the subject, were the components ol tin Jacobin spirit. The true- Jacobin had something about him at once powerful, original and sombre, He stood midway between the agitator and the statesman; between the Protestant an Monk; between the inquisitor and the tribune. Hence that ferocious vigilance transformed into a virtue : that spy system raised to the rank of a patriotic organisation : and that mania for d' ciation, which made people at first laugh at last tremble.\" After the days of October the Assembly fol lowed the King to Paris ; and the famous club was established, first in a large hall which served as library to the Dominican monks at the convent of the Rue Saint-Honore, and afterwards, when tin- order had been dissolved, in the Convent Church. As the- Dominicans were more generally spoken ot as the Jacobins, the latter name was -nun applied to the Friends of the Constitution, who willingly adopt '1 it. The same thing, strangely enough, happened to the Cordeliers and the Feuillants ; so that the principal Revo lutionary parties got to be known throughout Europe by appellations formerly monastic. France, like England soon afterwards, had its . Inti-facobin. Les Sabbats Jacobites was th of the French publication, and the Jai \" mania for denunciation\" was thus satirised it What is still more curious is that the last of the Jacobin monks (in 1789 and 1 7<io ) took part in the meetings of which their convent was the scene, as, in like manner, did the last members ot the < trderof Cordeliers. The Jacobin Club possessed a large staff of officers, including a president, vice-president, four secretaries, twelve its columns : \u2014 Je denonce l'Allemagne, Le Portugal et l'Espagne, tique et la Champagne, La Sardaigne et le Pc-rou."], [187, "ARTHUR YOUNG AT THE JACOBIN CLUB. 165 The Jacobin Club.] themselves 111 direct contact with the outside world. Je denonce l'ltalie, L'Afrique et la Barbarie, L'Angleterre et la Russie Sans mtme excepter Moscou Among the questions put to candidates for election to the Jacobin Club were the following : \" What were you in 1780 ? What have you done since? What was your fortune until 1 789, and what is it now?\" Every candidate was bound to answer all questions addressed to him, and he was to do this publicly in a loud voice. Anyone rejected by the Jacobin Club became at once an object of suspicion ; and to be denounced by the Jacobin leaders was to receive a sentence of death. In this way perished the unfortunate Anacharsis Clootz, Fabre d'Eglantine, and many others. In spite of these attacks and a thousand others. the- importance of the Jacobin Club went on intly increasing ; and at the funeral of Mirabeau, who died in the first year of the Revolution, the President of the Jacobin Club marched side by side- with the President of the National Assembly, and had precedence of the Minister-. After the death of Mirabeau the influence of th'- Lameths, the Duports, the Barnaves, etc., gave way to that of Robespierre, in whom, says Louis Blanc, \"Jacobinism in its extremest points was personified.\" At the critical moment the Jacobins remained faithful to the fortune of their chief. On the news of his arrest they ordered permanent sittings and voted unanimously their approval of the insurrectionary attitude of the Paris Commune. They spoke of resistance. But, though men of action abounded in the Jacobin Club, the members, as a body, were pusillanimous and could do nothing. teaubriand, the Royalist, ought, however, heard on this subject as well as Louis Blanc, the Republican ; and this is what the- former j in his \" Essay on Revolutions,\" published in 17 17 :\u2014 \" Much has been said about the Jacobins, but few people have known them. Nearly everyone rushes into declamations, and publishes the crimes of this society without enlightening us as to the general principle which directed its views. This principle consisted in a system of perfection towards which the first step to take was to restore the laws of Lycurgus. If, moreover, it be con sidered that France is indebted to the Jacobins for its numerous armies, courageous and disciplined ; that it was the Jacobins who found the means of paying them, and of victualling a country without resources and surrounded by enemies ; that it was they who created a navy as if bv miracle, and who, through intrigues and money, ensured the neutrality of some of the powers ; that under their reign the greatest discoveries in natural history were made, and great generals formed ; that, in a word, they gave to a warlike body, and, so to say, organised anarchy ; one must then of necessity admit that these monsters, escaped from hell, had infernal talents \" Arthur Young in his \"Travels in France\" gives an interesting account of a meeting, which he attended, of the Jacobin Club at the time of the Revolution : \u2014 \" At night,\" he says, writing in diary form, \" M. Decretot and M. Blin carried me to the revolutionary club of the Jacobins ; the room where they assemble is that in which the famous league was signed. There were above one hundred deputies present, with a president in the chair ; I was handed to him and announced as tin author of the Arithmetiqut Politique. The President, standing up, repeated my name to the company and de manded if there were any objections. None ; and this was all the ceremony, not merely of an introduction, but election ; for I was told that now I was free to be present when I pleased, being a foreigner. Ten or a dozen other elections were made. In this Club the business that is to be brought into the National Assembly is regularly debated ; the motions are read that are intended to be made there, and rejected, or corrected and approved When these have been fully agreed to, the whole party are engaged to support them. Plans of conduct are here determined ; proper persons nominated to act on com mittees and as presidents of the Assembly named Ami I raav add that such is the majority of members that whatever passes in this Club is almost sure to pass in the Assembly .\" In 1791 the Jacobins were still Royalists, not from attachment to the Monarchy, but from a mlous regard for Constitutional legality. after the flight to Varennes they departed from their former principles so far as to demand the abdication of the king. The next day, however, on the proposition of Robespierre, they returned to their customary prudence, pro- it the Republic, and sent commis- to the Champ de Mars to take back their aid. Arthur Young also gives a description of a debate in the National Assembly on the subject of the conduct of the Chamber of Vacation in the Parliament of Rennes. In connection with most of the great revolu- v events their conduct was the same, h the aristocratic Jacobins of 1789 had now quitted the society, to be replaced by men of ne- views\u2014 journalists, orators, and members l,f the National Assembly, who desired to place M.

Nor could he in any case have turned it to much account, for he did not survive the astute coun sellor lor more than a year. THE whole history of Paris may be read along the line of the Boulevards, and the whole life of the capital observed there in concentrated form, ddie Palais Royal, however, w itli its theatres, its restaurants, its shops of all kinds, its galleries, and its gardens, is in scarcely a less degree an epitome of Paris. It was formerly known as the Palais Cardinal, in memory of Richelieu, by whom, in its original shape, it was constructed. Richelieu afterwards made such frequent additions to the building that it lost all symmetry. In one of the wings a theatre was constructed ; though it was not here, but in a large drawing-room, that the linal's tragedies, Eutrope and Mirame, were played. The palace, with its lateral develop ments, assumed tit last the form of a quadrangle with a large garden in the interior. It suffered from the irremediable fault of not having been constructed from the first on a definite plan, lint the garden, the fountain, the jewellers' shops, the booksellers' stalls, give the place a physiognomy of its own, and cause the beholder to overlook all architectural defe:ts. Having completed his palace, and convinced himself that he had constructed an edifice worthy the acceptance of his sovereign, Richelieu pre sented it to Louis XIII. (163b), afterwards con firming the gift in his will (1642). Corneille, the recipient now of favours, now ot slights from the great Cardinal, wrote, in an admiring mood, of the Cardinal's palace the following lines :\u2014 \" Non, l'univers entier ne peut rien voir d'ek'ai Aux superbes dehors du Palais-Cardinaf. Toute une ville entiere, avec pompe bade, Semble d'un vieux fosse par miracle sortie. Et nous fait presumer, a ses superbes toits, Que tous ses habitants sont des dieux ou des rois.\" * Louis XIV. passed some years of his childhood at the Palais-Cardinal, to which the name of Palais Royal was now given. Here the minister Mazarini, or Mazarin, resided during the troubles of the Fronde, and here it was that he heard the populace sing couplets about the Fa Italian;. \"They sing; they shall p murmured the minister. But he was obliged all the same to take flight ; and with the queen regent and the infant king he sought refugi al Saint-Germain. Never afterwards would the proud monarch inhabit the Palais Royal, which he assigned as a place of residence to Henrietta of France, Queen of England, and widow of Charles I. Afterwards, in 1692, Louis XIV. gave the Palais Royal as an absolute gift tu lib nephew, Philip of Orleans, Duke of Chartres, on the occasion of that prince's marriage. The Palace had now been increased by the addition of the Hotel Danville in the adjacent Rue- Richelieu, and of a gallery constructed by the celebrated architect Mansard.

Gaming-tables are kept in every cafe, and it i- a sight to see the sudden change in the expression of the players' faces as they lose or win. The Palais Royal is an elegant box of Pandora, beautifully carved, delicately worked, but containing what everyone knows it contains. All these followers of Sardanapalus or of Lucullus inhabit the Palais Royal, in apartments which the King of Assyria and the Roman Emperors would have envied.\" Under the Directory the number of gambling houses was limited, first to four, afterwards to eight ; and it was not until the reign of Louis Philippe that they were finally suppressed. The gambling house at Number 113 figures in the \" Peau de Chagrin \" of Balzac ; also in Dumas' \" Femme- au Collier de Velours.\" As pmdigal a- hi- grandfather, the regent, the Duke of I (rleans, was obliged to have recourse to IS expedients for replenishing his exhausted pier. It occurred to him to turn the galleries of the Palais Royal into long lines of simps. This involved the expenditure of a con siderable -um of money, but the result was most remunerative. The new Palais Royal became a centre of attraction to all Paris. Around the garden the three galleries, together with the one still known as the Galerie d'Orleans, formed a sort of bazaar, where jewellery, Ian-, and orna ments of all kinds were offered for sale. The \u25a0hops were varied by cafe's and restaurants. In the garden the Cafe de la Regcnee was estab lished, anil the Richelieu Theatre being once rebuilt, now formed the home ot the lie Franchise. Toward- the end of the Monarchical period the Palais Royal became ignised place of dissipation. In contrast with the loose morality of the locality was the rigid exactitude with which, every day at noon, a cannon in the centre of the garden, fired by the rays of the sun through a powerful lens, announced the hour ; and crowds of people- used emble round it, watch in hand, towards twelve o'clock. Walking through the Palais Royal one day with the Duke- of Orleans, the Abbe Dclillc was requested by the Prince to sum up in a few words his ideas of the place, and did so in the following quatrain : \u2014 As for the \"Palace\" \u2014 the mansion inhabited in- Mazarin and the infant Louis XIV., after wards by Henrietta of England, and then by various members of the Orleans family \u2014 Napo leon established public offices in it. During the Hundred Days the palace was occupied by Lucien Bonaparte, and on the restoration of the Monarchy the whole place was bought back from the Government by the- then Duke of Orleans, afterwards Louis Philippe. Some changes were made in the direction ofthe galleries, the popu larity of which remained a- great as ever. Nor was this diminished by the foreign occupation, for the Palai- Royal was thronged day and night by officers of the Allied Army. It was now that the Cafe Lemblin became the head-quarters ot Bonapartist officers on half-pay, and the Cafe des Mille Colonnes that of the officers serving in the newly organised Royalist army ; and between the two bodies of officers numerous duels were fought. An ingenious rhymed description of the Palais Royal in its best and worst days has been left by De'saugiers, the celebrated song writer of the period before Be'ranger, of which we may quote the concluding lines, telling how the resort, from being the scene of politi cal storms, came to be the general rendez-vous of pleasure-seekers of every kind and every nationality, from the Fleming to the Turk, and from the genius to the fool : \u2014 \" f 1.1ns ce jardin tout se rencontre, Excepte l'ombrage et les fleurs.

LET us now return to the Palais Royal, and __j to the- theatre which adjoins it. The Come die Francaise, or Theatre Frangais, as it is also called, was never, as the first of these names might suggest, devoted exclusively to comedy. The word \"comedy\" was used in France in the early days of its stage to denote any kind of theatrical entertainment. The famous \"Ballet Comique de la Reine,\" produced towards the end of the loth century, was, in fact, a dramatic entertainment with singing and dancing, strongly resembling what would now be called an opera ; and the author of the work explains, in his preface, that he calls it \"ballet comique,\" instead of \" ballet \" alone, because it possesses a dramatic character. Volumes innumerable have been written on the origin of the French theatre, 1 which had as humble a beginning as the theatre in all other European countries ; with the ex ception, however, of opera, which in the earliest days of the musical drama enjoyed the special patronage of kings, princes, cardinals, and great noblemen. first regular troop of the Comedie Fi had its origin in a combination of wan companies. At the end of the sixteenth, and during; tin early part of the seventeenth century, the English stage, with Marlowe, Shakespeare, Pen Jonson, and other dramatic poets of the Elizabethan period, was far superior to the stage of France, which scarcely indeed existed at the time. But towards the end of the seventeenth century the French theatre enjoyed the supreme advantage of possessing simultaneously the tin. dramatists that France even to this day has produced : Corneille, Moliere, and Racine. It is a little more than two centurie in the year 1689, that the theatre where \"the comedians of the king\" habitualh formed received the title of Comedie Frani though its constitution dates from 1680, when, by order of Louis XIV, the company of the Hotel de Bourgogne was united to that ol the Theatre Guenegaud in the Rue Mazarin. The history of the Comedie Francaise cannot well be separated from that of Corneille a Moliere, its greatest writers; thougl who died in 1073, and Corneille, who died in 1684, produced their works long before the The'atre Francais was officially constituted. Perhaps the most interesting account of the In Italy, during the Renaissance period, the musical drama was invented by popes, cardinals, and other illustrious personages bent on restoring in modern form the ancient drama of the Greeks.

One of the most interesting member- ot this celebrated company was Mdlle. du Pare, for whom is claimed the unique honour of having been passionately beloved by the three greatest dramatist- of France : Corneille, Moliere, and Racine. Having to choose between three writers, of whom the first was old, the second middle aged, and the third young, Mdlle. du Pare was eccentric enough to select the last ; a prefer ence which left Moliere silent, but which pro voked from Corneille some verses so admirable that one cannot but forgive the lady who, by her heartless conduct, called forth such lines. Corneille- and Moliere had at this time separate companies, and Mdlle. du Pare appears to have acted in both. Corneille in any case endeavoured to persuade Mdlle. du Pare to pass from Moliere's company to bis own, pointing out to her that the troop of his friend Moliere 'was very inferior in tragedy, so that -he would always be sacrificed, since she excelled above all in the tragic style.\" Racine employed the same kind of argument as Corneille-. and ultimately succeeded in taking away the much-admired actress from Moliere's company in order to attach her to his theatre of the Hotel de Bourgogne, where tragedies from his pen were habitually produced. Mdlle. du Pare, who had previously caused an estrange ment between Corneille and Moliere, now brought about a complete rupture between Moliere and Racine. Even in these early days Louis XIV the greatest interest in theatrical representa tions, especially those given by Moi company. Perhaps the very best period ol the French stage was between the years 1645, when Moliere abandoned the law court- to join a troop of wandering players, and 1680, when the two most important companies of the da} combined ; at which time Moliere had been dead seven years, while Corneille was on the point of dying. The Comedie Fram, aise was formed in the most arbitrary manner. It has been said that the company which had been in the- habit us pl at the Hotel de Bourgogne was joined to that of the Theatre Gue'negaud in the Rue Ma Put there was at that day a third theatre in Pari-, the Theatre du Marais ; and in order that every thing dramatic might be concentrated at the one establishment, this unhappy house was suppressed. By Royal decree the number ut actors and actresses connected with the Comidie Franraisc was fixed at twenty - seven. A year later the establishment received fir the first time an annual subvention, to the amount ut i:,ooo livres or francs. At the same time the French comedians were authorised, in lieu of pn arrangements, to deduct the full expenses ol the theatre before paying anything to the authors, The company had scarcely taken pos the Theatre de Gue'negaud when they woi obliged to leave it for another and mon modious building in the Rue des Fosses, Saint- Germain-des-Pres ; and it was here that tin of Comedie Franraisc- was first adopted. ' the name of the Rue de l'Ancienne Comedie in which street, newly baptised, the Cumedit Francaise was for so main' years installed. The Comedie Francaise had everything & itself until the year 1699, when much alarm and indignation was caused in the ranks ot company by the establishment of an oppo theatre,\" the Comedie Italieime. The! comedians were ready to do anything in order to keep their monopoly. In a formal petition The story of Mdlle. du Pare, with the intrigues of which she was made the object, brings out clearly the fact that in the early days of the French stage there was not one theatre, but three ; Corneille, Mi there, and Racine having each bis separate company. In the present day the Theatre Francais comprises in its repertory all the masterpieces of France's three greatest dramatists ; and many imagine that for this famous establish ment may be claimed the honour of having fir.-t produced them. But the finest tragedies and comedie- that France possesses were written for theatre.- of little or no standing ; and not, as just pointed out, fur \"lie, but for three different theatres. An actre-s celebrated in her time, Mdlle. Bcauprc:, made some celebrated remarks"], [199, "UNDER LOUIS XV. The Comedie Francaise. 1 175 they represented to the king that they were twenty-six in number (the principal actress had died) and capable, if necessary, of amusing His Majesty at two different theatres. They thought it hard, however, that after quitting, by His Majesty's orders, first the Hotel de Bourgogne, then the Theatre Gue'negaud, they should now be- threatened in their new abode, which had cost them Joo.ooo francs to construct. In 1770 the famous company again changed their domicile, and, by the- king's special per mission, took posses-ion of the theatre built in 167 1 at the palace of the- Tuileries. Here they remained twelve years, until 17*-, when they left the palace of the king- of France and installed themselves in the house afterwards to become known as the Odeon, on the left bank of the Seine, close to the Luxemburg Palace. According to Frcron, the daring satirist who was in no way afraid t< 1 take even Voltaire for his mark, the dramatic literature of France had now fallen to a very low point, bv reason of the worldly success of its authors. \"The gay life of most ot our authors helps,\" wrote Freron, \"to keep them within the bounds of mediocrity. Love of pleasure, the attractions of society^ that luxury which had so long kept them at a respectful distance, now enervate their souls. They are men of society, men of fashion, runners after women, and them selves much run after. They are at every party, every entertainment ; no supper is complete without them ; they are sumptuously dressed, and have luxuriously furnished rooms. It was not by supping out every night in society- that the Comedies, the Molieres, the La Fontaines, and the Boileaus composed those masterpieces which will constitute for ever their glory and the glory of France. They were simply lodged and simply clothed ; a large flat cap covered the sublime head of the great Corneille, but all the assembly rose before him when he made his appearance at the play.\" .Since the days ot Freron the incomes and the luxury of French dramatic authors have greatly increased ; a result mainly due to the exertions of Beaumarchais, whose Marriage of Figaro was produced at the Comedie Francaise two years after it- installa tion at the Odeon in 17X4. It was Beaumarchais who secured for French dramatic authors a fixed proportion of the receipts, and caused this equitable arrangement, previously unknown, to be perpetuated. The king paid no attention to these repre sentations, and the Comedie Italic-line soon became the home of French comic opera, doing a flourishing business according to the tariff of when a place in the pit cost five and a seat in the boxes ten. The Comedie Francaise did not in the long run suffer from the popularity of the opposition theatre, and perhaps profited by it. But soon the Comedie Francaise was to be subjected to a new- inconvenience, and in the very year which had witnessed the invasion of the Comedie Italic-nne a tax was imposed on theatres gener ally for the benefit of the poor \u2014 \" taxe des pauvre: \" which exists even to the present day.

At two o'clock, when the doors were opened, a band of romanticists entered the theatre and forthwith searched it in view of any hostile classicists who might be lying hid in dark corners, ready to rise and hiss as soon as the curtain should go up. No classicists, however, were discovered ; the band of romanticists was under the direction of Gerard de Nerval, author of the delightful \"Voyage en Orient,\" translator of \" Faust \" in the early days when he called himself simply Gerard, and Heine's collaborator in the French prose translation of the \" Buch der Liedc-r.\" On the eve of the battle, Gerard de Nerval, as Theophile Gautier has told us in one of many accounts he wrote of the famous representation, visited the officers who were to act under him ; their number, according to one account, includ ing Balzac, first of French novelists, if not first novelist of the world ; that Wagner of the past, Hector Berlioz ; Auguste Maquet, the dramatist; and Joseph Bouchardy, the melo dramatist, together with Alexander Dumas, historian (in his \"Memoirs\") of the rehearsals of Hernani, and Theophile Gautier, chronicler in more than one place of its first representation. Hernam was the third play that Victor Hugo had written, but the first that was repre sented. There seems never to have been any intention of bringing out Cromwell, published :;, and known to this day chiefly by its preface. Marion Delorme, Victor Hugo's second dramatic work, was submitted to the Theatre Franeais, but rejected, not by the management, but by the Censorship, and, indeed, by Charles X. himself, with whom Victor Hugo had a personal interview- on the subject. \"The picture of Louis XIII. 's reign,\" says a writer on tin- subject, \"was not agreeable to his descen dant ; and the last of the Bourbon kings is said to have been particularly annoyed at the omnipo tent part assigned 111 Victor Hugo's drama to the great Cardinal de Richelieu.\" But Victor Hugo had the persistency of genius, and though both his first efforts had miscarried, he was ready soon after the rejection of Marion me with another piece \u2014 that spirited, al work Hernani, which is usually re- d as his fiiie-t dramatic effort. Hernani, like Marion Delorme, was condemned by the \u25a01 -hip ; being objected to not on political, but on literary, moral, and general grounds.

They had brought with them hams, tongues, and bottles of wine ; and they had what the Americans call a \" good time \" during the interval that passed before the public was admitted \u2014 eating, drink ing, singing songs, and discussing the beauties of the piece they had come to applaud. \" As soon as the doors of the theatre were opened the band of romanticists,\" says The'ophile Gautier, \" turned their eyes toward- the incomers, and if among them a pretty woman appeared her arrival was greeted with a burst of applause.

It was in the provinces that she si her style ; and for so long a time did she wander about from theatre to theatre that she was already twenty-seven years of age when an engagement was offered her at the Comedie Francaise. Here she was equally successful in tragedy and in comedy, though in the latter line her imper sonations seem to have been chiefly confined to high comedy. Thus one of her best parts was that of Celiniene in the Misanthrope. Adrienne was well acquainted with Voltaire when Count Maurice de Saxe, one ofthe innumerable natural children of Augustus II., King of Poland\u2014 Carlyle's Augustus the Strong \u2014 came to try his fortune in Paris. This was in the year 1720. In the first instance he met with no luck ; and he had to wait a considerable time before he could get a simple regiment together. \" Although he was scarcely twenty-four years of age,\" says a remarkable writer of the time, \" Maurice had already made eleven campaigns and repudiated one wife. He joined,\" continues this unconscious humourist, \" to the strength of his father the uncultured youth and fiery disposition of a sort of nomad, somewhat like our Du Guesclin, whom ladies used to call the wild boar. Under the guise of a Sarmatian, Adrienne discovered the hero, and undertook to polish the soldier. She was then thirty years of age, and had gained the experience and the passion which render a woman alike skilful to please and prompt to love.\" In the year 1833 a private person was for the first time named Director of the Comedie Fran caise. Jouslin de La Salle was hi- name, and he was succeeded, first by M. Vedel, in 1837, and afterwards by M. Buloz, Director of theRevue des Deux Mondes. In 1S52 the affairs ofthe theatre were entrusted to a committee of six members of the Comedie Francaise under the direction ot an \"administrator\"; the first administrator being M. Arse-ne Houssaye, the well-known author and journalist. M. Houssaye was replaced in 1856 by M. Empis, and M. Empis in 1860 by M. Edouard Thierry, a dramatist. The present director isM. Perrin. 'The subvention paid by the Government to the Comedie Francaise was fixed definitively in [856 at 240,000 francs a year. Among the- actors and actresses who have appeared at this famous establishment, often pleasantly described a- La Maison de Moliere (though Moliere, as already seen, never set foot in it), may be mentioned Adrienne Lecouvreur, Mdlle. Mars, Mdlle. Clairon, Mdlle. Contat, Mdlle. Raucourt, Talma, Rachel, Sarah Bernhardt, not to name many excellent comedians who in the present day are almost as well known in London as in Paris. Adrienne Lecouvreur was carried off, after a short and somewhat mysterious illness, mi the 20th of March, 1730. So sudden was her death that the public, who adored her, would not believe that it arose from natural causes ; and the Duchess de Bouillon, known to be her rival and her implacable enemy, was declared by everyone to be her murderess. According to the story current at the time she owed her death to a box of poisoned sweetmeats, treacherously presented to her, though Scribe and Legouve, in their well-known play, make her die from the effect of a poisoned bouquet given to her by the duchess, in feigned admiration of her genius. All that is really known on the subject is to be found in the \" Memoirs \" of the Abbe Annillon, the \" Lei of Mdlle. Aisse, and a note appended to one \"I these letters by Voltaire himself. The popular version of the incidents us Adrienne's death was as follows. One night, when she was playing the part of Phedre, sh saw in a box close to the stage the Duchess de- Bouillon, who, she knew, was endeavourii replace her in the affections of Count de Save; In the immediate neighbourhood of the Comedie Franchise was born Adrienne Le couvreur. Less perhaps from the influence of the genius loci than from a desire to imitate the actors and actresses whom, from day to day, she must have seen passing her door, little Adrienne accustomed herself at an early age to act plays and scenes from plays with her young com panions. Adrienne's talent was soon noticed by an inferior actor named Legrand, who, after teaching her some of the tricks of his trade, procured an engagement for her somewhere in"], [207, "ADRIENNE LECOUVREUR. 183 The Comedie Franrjaise.] own natural impulse. His verses were not in tended for publication, for he knew that if they were seen by the clergy they might get him into trouble. He simply sent a copy of the poem to his friend Thieriot, and perhaps to others, with a strong recommendation to keep it secret. The first thing, however, that Thieriot seems to have done was to take Voltaire's verses with him into and the sight of this woman made her de liver with exceptional energy these indignant lines : \u2014 \" Je sais mes perfidies, \u0152none, et ne suis pas de ces femmes hardies Oui, goutant dans le crime une tranquille paix, Ont su se faire un front qui ne rougit jamais \" A- the Duchess de Bouillon, according to Mdlle. Aisse, was capricious, violent, impulsive, and much addicted to love affairs, she might well i-idc-rcd one of those \"brazen women who, finding an untroubled calm in crime, succeed in acquiring a brow that knows no blush.\" It may- be believed, too, that Adrienne made every point tell, so that the duchess, brazen-faced as she might be, would feel wounded to the quick.

The clergy could have no wish to re-awaken the scandal caused by the circumstances of Adrienne Lecouvreur's burial, and though Voltaire left Paris when he found that his poem on the death of Adrienne was being circulated everywhere in manuscript, there does not seem to have been any necessity for this species of flight. The place of Adrienne's burial, which long remained unknown, was discovered years afterwards, during some work of excavation and demolition. Vol taire and Maurice de Saxe were both dead ; but an old friend of hers, named D'Argental, was still living, and he hastened to mark the spot by a tablet to her memory. Voltaire, on the other hand, wrote in a manu script note appended to Mdlle. A'isse's narrative : \" She died in my arms of inflammation of the bowels, and it was I who caused the body to be i ipened. All that Mdlle. Aisse says on the subject is mere popular rumour without any foundation.\" The Comedie Francaise, beneath whose shadow Adrienne Lecouvreur was brought up, is not the only theatre connected with the Palais Royal. The Theatre du Palais Royal forms part of the spacious construction from which it derives its name, and is entered from the Palais Royal itself. Standing at the northern extremity of the Galerie de Beaujolais, it was constructed in 1783 by Louis, architect to the Duke of Orleans. Its original name was Theatre Beaujolais, and its original occupant the manager of a company of marionettes. The marionette- were replaced by children playing exclusively in pantomimes.

Montan-icr, who had formerly directed the Royal Theatre of Versailles, and who had followed the king and queen, took possession of the little theatre in the Palais Royal, and opened it under the title of Theatre de- Varictes. Every kind of play was presented, and it was here that the directress brought out as a child the afterwards famous Mdlle. Mars. In time, under the Empire, the company of the Palai- Royal left it to take posses-ion of the theatre on the Boulevard Montmartre, to which the name of Theatre des Varictes was there upon transferred. The Palais Royal Theatre now passed into the hands of a succession of managers, who relied, one on tight-rope dancers, another on marionettes, and a third on learned dogs. \"'These animals,\" says Brazier in his \"Petits If the French clergy objected usually to bury and actresses with religious rites, they were scarcely likely to make an exception in favour of an actress who had died in the arms of Voltaire. Her body, then, was thrown \"a la \\i uric,\" as the author of Candide puts it, or, to be exact, was buried somewhere on the banks of the Seine, in the neighbourhood of a wharf, the interment being made- secretly and at midnight, a- though poor Adrienne had been a criminal.

This establishment became famous during the Hundred Days. Men of different periods met there as on some appointed fighting-ground ; and as a result of many violent scene- the house had to be closed. After the Revolution of 1830 the theatre, still associated with the name of Mdlle. Montansier, was restored to it- original purpose. Entirely reconstructed, it was opened to the public in June, 1831, under the title of Theatre du Palais Royal. A company of excellent comedians had been engaged, many of whom, such as Alcide, Tousez, \\ebai.l, Levassor (who loved t<> im personate eccentric Englishmen), Grassot, Ravel, and the fascinating Virginie Dejazet, were to attain European fame.

The \"King's Library\" \u2014 Francis I. and the Censorship \u2014 The Imperial Library \u2014 The Bouise. THE most interesting edifice- in the Rue Riche- lieu is the Library, called, according to the existing form of Government, Royal, National, or Imperial. Its original title was King's Library (Bi bliotheque du Roi ), and it has been suggested that, id the frequent changes of name to which the dity of things in France seems to expose this valuable institution, it should be called, once for all, Bibliotheque de France. The nucleus of the National Library, with its innumerable vol umes, wa- formed by Charles V., and received lerable additions, considerable at least for the time, when books were scarce, from Louis XL Under the reign of the latter sovereign so much value was attached to books of a rare character that, to obtain the- loan of a certain volume written bv the Arabian physician Rhazes, the king had tu furnish security, and bind himself by the most solemn obligations to return it. According to Dulaure, this pious monarch had but a poor reputation for returning books, combined with Im getting them into his possession. \"In 147-,\" says the author of \"'The History of I of the \" Singularitcs Historiques,\" \"Hermann Von Stathoen came from Mayenceto I by the famous printers Scheffer and Hanequis to sell a certain number of printed bunks. While at Paris he was attacked by fever and died. In virtue of the droit i/'auliiiin the king's officers took possession of the books and || the defunct, sending the latter to the king'- exchequer and the former to the king's library. 'This proceeding was by no means to the \u25a0d SchefTcr and Hanequis, who complained tu the emperor, and obtained from him lettei to Louis XI. in which the French king ivited to restore both books and money. XI. admitted the justice of the claim, and \"ii the twenty-first of April, 1475, issued Letters Patent in these term-: - Desiring to treat favour ably the subjects (Scheffer and Hanequis) of the Archbishop of Mayence, and having regard to 1|\" trouble and labour which the pi 1 -mis in \u25a0 ' had 111 connection with the art and craft of printing, and to the profit and utility 1 from it, both Im- the public- good and for \u2122 l!\" learning ; and considering that due and estimation of the -aid books and other property which have come to our know-ledge do not amount to more- than 2,425 crowns and three sous, at which the claimants have valued them, we have for the above considerations and others liberally condescended to cause the said sum of -,4-5 crowns and three sous to be restored to the said Conrad Hanequis.\" Dulaure, after citing this letter, adds that the restitution was made in such a manner that the printers received every year from the King's Treasury a mere driblet of 800 livres, or francs, until the entire sum had beer, repaid. Louis XII. had formed a library of his own at Blois, to which he added those collected by his predecessors. Francis I., called the Father of Letters, honoured writers, and had a particular taste for manuscripts ; but he detested printed books, and, like the- reactionists of the period, deplored the invention of printing, which the pre vious occupants of his throne had looked upon as ofthe greatest benefit to mankind. On the 13th of June, 1535, he ordered all the printing offices in the kingdom to be closed, and prohibited, under the severest penalties, the printing of any fresh books. Some have supposed that the king's sole object was, by preventing the repro duction of books, to keep up the value of the manuscripts which he so much prized. Against this view, however, must he placed the- fact that when, in reply to remonstrances from various deputations, he rescinded his order against the printing offices a month after its issue, he at the same time limited the number of printing offices to twelve, which were only allowed to print books approved beforehand and deemed absolutely necessary. Thus Francis I. must be regarded as the inventor of that nefarious institution, the Censorship, which followed the invention of print ing as shadow follows light. After the lapse ofa century or two, the Censorship was destined to do harm to France, even in a commercial sense ; for numbers of books which the Censor would never have allowed to be brought out in France were printed and sold in England, Holland, and Germany. - Whoever opposes the freedom of the Press,\" wrote Merrier on this subject two centuries and a half after Francis I.'s institution of the Censorship,"], [212, "i88 PARIS, OLD AND NEW.

Such names as pantry, pastry, sai butlery, were- given to the different building departments by the bakers, the pastry-cook makers of sauces, and the keepers ofthe wine. Whatever meaning was attached to the word, it i- certain that when in 1204 Philip Augustus built or reconstructed the Louvre he gave it the form, the defences, and the armament ot a fortress. It was the strong point in the line ot fortifications with which this monarch sur rounded Paris. 'The first existing document in which the Louvre is mentioned by name is an account of the year 1205 for provisions and wine consumed by citizens who in the Louvre had done- military duty.

The succeeding kings until the time of Francis I. occupied themselves very little with the Louvre, and scarcely ever resided there.

John IV., Duke of Brittany, Charles II. , King of Navarre, and John II. , Duke of Alencon, were among many other illustrious prisoners shut up in the Big 'Tower or donjon of the- ancient Louvre. During this first period of its history, from Philip Augustus until Francis I., the Louvi the scene of numerous historical events. In 1358, during the captivity of King Jim in England, the citizens of Paris, in support of the deputies of the communes in the States-General, besieged and took the Louvre, driving awaj the governor, and carrying off to the Hotel di all the arms and ammunition they could find in the arsenal of the fortress.

It was at the Louvre, moreO> 1377, that the Emperor of Germany, Chari allied himself with Charles V.of Tram Louis IX. arranged in the west wing of the Louvre a large hall, which was long known as the Chamber of St. Louis. Charles V. enlarged and embellished the Louvre. He added to it another storey, and did all in his power to change what had hitherto been a purely military building into a convenient and agreeable place of abode. The architecture of the building, originally con structed for use, not show, wa- in many respects improved, and the gates were surmounted with ornaments and piece- ot sculpture.

When first erected, it was looked upon as an unapproachable masterpiece ; and it exercised on architecture abroad, as well as at home, a considerable influ ence which still lasts. Colbert, appointed superintendent ot royal buildings, was now ordered to complete the Louvre. The first thing to do was to add a facade on the east ; by an idea which has since become commonplace, but which was strikingly original at the time, the Minister opened a com petition for the best design. The one most ad mired was the work not of an architect, but ofa doctor, Claude Perrault by name. Colbert was delighted with it, but before coming to a decision about a matter of so much importance, he sent to Nicolas Poussin, then at Rome, the designs of all the competitors except Perrault. Poussin sent back all the drawings with severe criticisms, and submitted a plan of his own, which satisfied neither Colbert nor the king. Things had reached this point, and Colbert wa- about to take upon himself the responsibility of adopting Per rault'- design, when he was urged by the Abbe Benedetti and Cardinal Chigi, afterwards Pope Alexander VII., to have recourse to the services of the celebrated Bernini, whose reputation was at that time universal. 'Thu- pressed, Colbert addressed himself to the Duke de Crequy, French ambassador at the Pontifical Court, and \u25a0 I him to see Bernini on the subject. Louis XIV., moreover, wrote- himself to Bernini a letter, which made him resolve to visit France. After finishing his colonnade, Perrault tried to bring it into harmony with the earlier pc of the building.

The Louvre, as we know it, with its magnifi cent gallery of pictures open to the whole world, dates only from the Revolution. There were from the time of Francis I. pictures in the old palace, and the collection was constantly increased under his successors. But the galleries were private. They were reserved for the delectation of the sovereign and his court. At the very beginning, however, of the Revolution, the Louvre was literally invaded, and some of the unfinished portions were finished in an unex pected manner by being converted into private dwelling houses. But the Republican Govern ment soon put an end to this ; and it was under the Convention that the picture gallery of the Louvre, increased by works of art from other palaces, was for the first time thrown open to the public. The meaning, however, of Louis XIV.'s apparent liberality was, from a Versailles point of view, that the Louvre was not worth living in. To provide furnished apartments for the recipients of the king's bounty, it was unfortu nately necessary to put up partitions so as to divide and sub-divide the majestic halls of the palace into little sitting-rooms and bed-rooms. The Louvre was now an hotel, or rather a niscrai, in which everyone made his bed i pleased him. Worse still, traders were allowed to erect shops and booths in front of the thi improvised constructions resting, I, on the palace walls. In 1754, under the us Louis XV, Marigny, superintendent of fine arts, undertook to remedy this state of things. ded in interesting the king, who not only ordered the space in front of the Louvre to but empowered the architect, Gabriel, nplete the edifice. Gabriel continued the unfinished facade, but had made but little pro- when Louis XV. died. To speak only of the building, it was con tinued by the Republic, and all but completed by Napoleon, who, after appointing a committee of artists, and receiving from them a report in favour ot Pierre Lescot's design, determined, on his own responsibility, to finish the Louvre ac cording to the later design of Claude Perrault. Napoleon wished, moreover, to join the Louvre to the Tuileries, so as to make of the two palaces one immense- palace. Two architects, Percier and Fontaine, were ordered to put this project into form, and they presented their plans to the Minister of Fine Arts in 1813. But the Imperial Government was now near its fall, and it was not during the calamitous retreat from Moscow that architectural project- of any kind could be enter tained.

'The- walls of the highest rooms are covered with pictures up to the ceiling. 'The following will give some idea ot the number of pictures, by the greatest masters, contained in the eleven rooms : \u2014 There are sixteen by Raphael, six by Correggio, five by Giulio Romano, ten by Leonardo da Vinci, eight by Giorgione, twenty three- by Titian, sixteen by Carraccio, eight by Domenichino, twelve by Guido, six by Tintoretto, eighteen by Paul Veronese, fourteen by Van Dyck, seventeen by Poussin, and six by M. Le brun, among whose works there are some (the battles of Alexander ) which are 40 feet long. Besides these pictures there arc a quantity of others by Rubens, Albano, Antonio Moro, and other masters of equal renown. Apart from the pictures, there arc in the old Hotel de Grammont many groups of figures and low reliefs in bronze and ivory.\" trouble as a pamphleteer; bu: afterwards, in 1750, Louis XIV. allowei masterpieces previously stowed away in the apartments of the household at Versailles taken to Paris and submitted to the admii of painter.- and lovers of painting.

The picture dedicated by Rubens to Marie de Medici on view the same days, and during th, hours. Until the reign of Louis XVI. the royal pic tures, the number of which had been increased by the purchase of many examples of the Flemish school, continued to be divided into two prin cipal sections, one placed in the Luxe-nil visible twice a week to the public, the other kept out of sight in the palace of Versailles. The Louvre contained the \"king's cabinet of draw ings,\" to the number of about 10,000. The Apollo Gallery, which served as studio tu sij students patronised by the king, contained \" The Battles of Alexander,\" and some other pictures by Lebrun, Mignard, and Rigaud. 'The royal visit, as described by the- writer in la Merc ure Galant, was followed by the dis- 11 of the collection. Louis XIV. was so pleased by the wonderful sight that he ordered a number of the pictures to be removed to Ver sailles, where, according to the Mercure, there were already twenty-six pictures by the first masters ; and so long as Versailles was the royal residence- the greater part of the king's collection wa- lost to the public, and served only to furnish the rooms, except, indeed, when the pictures had fallen to the ground and lay there covered with dust. Under the reign of Louis XIV. a critic whose- name is worth preserving, Lafont de St. Ve-nnc, complained that so many beautiful work were allowed to lie heaped up together and buried in \"the obscure prison of Versailles,\" and demanded that all these treasures, \" immense but unknown,\" should be \"arranged in becoming order and preserved in the best condition \" in a gallery built expressly for their reception in the Louvre, where they would be \"exhibited to the admiration and joy ofthe- French or the curiosity of foreigners, or finally to the study and emula tion otdur young scholars.\" In 1775, under Louis XVI., Count d'Angiviller succeeded the Marquis de Marigny, and going .1 step beyond him, formed the project of collecting everything of value that the Crown pos the- way of painting and sculpture. Contemporary writers applauded this idea, which was attributed by some t<> M. de la Condamine. All, however, that came of the new proposal was that instead Ot pictures being brought from Versailles to Paru, the Louvre collection was transferred sailles. \"It was necessary,\" writes M. Viardot, \"that a new sovereign\u2014 the nation\u2014 should conn into power for all these immortal works rescued from the royal catacombs to be restored to dayhgl and to life.

Thus pictures from the galleries of Parma, Piacenza, Milan, Cremona, Modena, and Bologna, were made- over to France by the armistices of Parma, Bologna, and Tolen tino. The public was admitted to view the conquered treasure- on the 6th of February 1798. Some months afterwards masterpieces from Verona, Mantua, Pesaro, Loretto, and Rome were added to the marvellous collections; which on the 1'ith of March, I Soo, was further augmented by drafts of pictures from Florence and Turin. In 1S07 France received the artistic spoils of Germany and Holland. A step in this direction had already been taken .1, when it was decreed that the artistic treasures of the nation should be brought together at the Louvre. The year following, August 14th, lative Assembly appointed a com- \u25a01 for collecting the statues and pictures distributed among the various royal residences; and mi the [8th of October in the same year, . Minister of the Interior, wrote to the celebrated painter David, who was a member of the Convention, to communicate to him the plan ofthe new establishment. Finally, a deer\u00a9 ot July :7th, 1703, ordered the opening of the \"Museum of the Republic,\" and at the same time set forth that the \"marble statues, vases, and valuable pieces of furniture placed in the formerly known as royal, shall be trans- I to tlu Louvre, and that the sum of 100,000 francs shall be placed annually at the ition of the Minister of the Interior to purchase at private sales such pictures and statues as it becomes the Republic not to let pass into 1 band-, and which will be placed in the un ofthe Louvre.\" It should not he loi 1 that France was then at war with all the 01 Power-, and threatened by all the Powers of Europe. Crushed by military expenditure, the Republic had yet money- to spare for the purchase ol works of art. Among the famous works of art which France at this time possessed, and which were all on exhibition at the Louvre, may be mentioned ''The Belvedere Apollo,\" \" The Laocoon,\" \"The Medicean Venus,\" \"'The Wrestlers,\" \"The 'Transformation\" and \" The Spasimo \" ; Dome nichino's \" Communion of St. Jerome,\" Tinto retto's \"Miracle of St. Mark,\" Paul Veronese's four \" Last Suppers,\" and Titian's \" Assumption \" ; Correggio'- \" St. Jerome \" and Guercino's \" St. Petronilla \" ; \"'The Lances\" of Velasquez, and the \" St. Elizabeth \" of Murillo ; Rubens' \" Descent from the Cross,\" and Rembrandt's \" Night Patrol.\" 'The French say with sonic justice that many of these works by being sent to the Louvre weri saved from destruction. Many of them, too, though falling into decay, were restored with the greatest care ; and some were transferred with success from worm-eaten panel- to canvas, thus receiving new brilliancy and a new life. Whel Paris was occupied by the allies in 1814, the art treasures of which so many European countries had been despoiled were left in the possession ot the French, who may be said on this occasion to have been magnanimously treated. 'The object, indeed, of the allies was not to weaken nor to humiliate France as a nation, but simply to restore Louis XVIII. to the throne of his The French Museum, as the Louvre collection 1 ved afterwards the name of M I ,;n ot the Arts ; and it was first I to the public on the 8th of November, The next decree in connection with the ed that a number of pictures and nieily belonging t\u00ab> the palace of Ver- . and which the inhabitants of Versailles as their property, should be placed in the Louvre.

French statesmen protested that the pictures and statues brought to Paris from so many foreign picture galleries belonged to France in virtue of formal treaties and conventions ; Louis XVIII. himself declined to sanction the restoration of the captured pictures and statues. Denon, Director -General of Museums, resisted even when threatened with imprisonment in a Prus sian fortress; and he made the foreign com missaries sign a declaration to the effect that in giving up the works claimed he yielded only to foi 'The so-called spoliation of the Louvre was at last effected.

L'ndc-r the new monarchy the- beautiful though armless Venus of Milo was brought to France ; and under the Second Empire \" The Conception\" of Murillo was purchased for 615,000 francs. 'The Third Republic, under the presidency of M. Thiers, spite of its difficulties in connection with the crushing war indemnity, paid 206,000 francs for a fresco by Raphael. The regular annual allowance to the Minister of Fine Arts for the purchase of pictures is now 100,000 francs a year. Meanwhile, the Louvre collection has been con stantly augmented by pictures transferred to the mote classical museum from the gallery of pictures by living artists in the Luxembourg. The pictures exhibited at the Louvre are arranged on a system which leaves nothing to be desired. 'The supreme masterpieces of the collection are all together, without reference to school, nationality, or period, in a large square room known as the Salon Carre. In the other rooms the pictures arc arranged historically. The principal entrance to the picture galleries of the Louvre is in the Pavilion Moliere, ipposite the square of the Carrousel.

On the 1st of the following September, having come out brilliantly in an examination, he was appointed second lieutenant in the artillery regiment of La Fayette. He had then passed by only fourteen days his sixteenth birthday. The School of Gentlemen Cadets, the military cradle of the future Emperor, was not precisely the school which Louis XV. had founded. His grandson had perceived that to admit, as a matter of right, children from eight to thirteen years of age- would fill the military school with youths who had no fitness for the military career. He solved the problem by establishing in various country towns twelve colleges, where those qualified for ad mission could study up to the age of fifteen, after which a selection was made with a view to the Military School of Paris. One of these colleges was at Brienne, where the young Napoleon studied before being passed for the- Military- School. It had produced, all the same, General Bona parte, who was even then preparing the plans of his Italian campaign. The very next year the young cadet of the Royal Military School re entered the Ecole Militaire to establish his head quarters there as general commanding in chief the army of Paris. When he became emperor he inscribed on the- portico of the school words: \" Napoleon's headquarters\"; which only disappeared in 1815, when a regiment of the Imperial Guard was replaced in the building by the Royal Guard. Since it has ceased to be a school the so-called Ecole Militaire has been used as a cavalry ami artillery barrack. 1'ntil 1 ySq no one was admitted to the Military- School but sons of officers and noblemen. In the first year of the Revolution the Constitutional Ministers of Louis XVI. procured a decree from the Council which abolished the qualification of nobility. This was not so great an innovation as it may appear, since Louis XV. had by a decree of the year 1750 granted privileges of nobility to officers ; the children, therefore, of all officers were admissible to the Military School. The institution was all the same of doubtful origin ; and not knowing what else to do with it the Convention abolished it in June, 1793, took possession of its funds, and changed the building into a flour magazine and a cavalry depot. The Champ de Mars, in front of the Ecole Militaire, has a very varied history. Here in the ninth century the Normans were defeated by Eudes, son of Robert the Strong, Count of P who called the scene of his exploit, not Champ de Mars, but more explicitly, Champ de la Vietoire. Then for many centuries the Field of Victory, 01 of Mars, seems to have witnessed nothing in particular until, at last, under the reign of Louis XV., it became the scene of a grand rc-vieu in which the students of the Royal Military School took part. While the review was going young officer, nephew of Orry, controller ol finance, who had suffered from the persecutionol the king's favourite, was brought before a court martial on an accusation of treason, suggested bv the defeat ofthe French army in Germany. He was ahout to be condemned, when the king was informed by express, that not only was Orry no traitor, but that the whole army, emu promised by a serious mistake on the part Ot its commander. Marshal Maillebois, owed ib safety to Orrv's presence of mind, and tu a vigorous charge of cavalry directed by him. Louis XV. gave the young man a new com mission, thus marking the opening of the Champ de Mars by an act of justice.

In July, 1700, the year after the taking of the Bastille, the general federation of the nation was celebrated ; and a quarter of a century later, after Napoleon's return from Elba, and immediately before the loo campaign, the emperor assembled in the Champ de Mars the authorities and repre sentative bodies of the country in order to swear fidelity to the new Constitution which he had just promulgated, even as Louis XVI. had sworn fidelity to the Constitution adopted by the National Assembly. which was followed by a body of infantry, the electors of Paris, the Paris Commune, and the National Assembly, preceded by a regiment of children, and followed by a regiment of old men with the flags of the sixty battalions of Paris around them. Then came the representatives ot the federated departments, preceded by two mar shals of France with a numerous staff, and followed by a number of officers of various corps, including the Ring's Body Guard. The procession passed through the town amid the acclamations of the people and to the sound of artillery, approaching the Champ de Mars by way of the Champs Elysees, and crossing the river by a bridge of boats constructed the night before just opposite the village of Chaillot. the 5th of June all military and naval . national or foreign, were invited to send a number of delegates, according to the forces eiited, to an assembly which was to be held in the Champ de Mars on the 14th of the month following. The details of the celebration were ited by special decree ; and artists of all kinds were invited to make suggestions towards the arrangement and decoration ofthe plain. It wa- determined in the first instance to convert thi- plain into a sort of basin or amphitheatre with sliping sides and a hollow in the middle. Many thousands of labourers were employed in thi- work, and they were ultimately joined by the whole population of Paris, just as two years afterwards all classes and conditions of people took part in the preparations for the festival of the Altar to the Country. At the entrance to the Champ de Mars, now transformed into a vast circus, had been raised a triumphal arch bearing a number of inscriptions, among which may be cited the following : \u2014 The rights of man were ignored for centuries ; they have been re-established for the whole of humanity. You love that liberty which you now possess ; prove your gratitude by preserving it. In the Champ de Mars 300,000 persons had assembled, men, women, and children, on the slopes of the newly-made amphitheatre, all wearing the national colours. The hillsides of Chaillot and of Passy were equally filled ; as further on were the amphitheatres of Meudon and St. Cloud, of Mont Valerien and Mont martre. In front of the Military School were ascending rows of seats, covered with blue and gold drapery, for the king, the court, the National Assembly, the various constituted bodies and the most distinguished guests.

A vast amphitheatre constructed in the National Garden (the garden of the Tuileries, that is to say ) held the members of the Convention, each of whom carried in his hand a bouquet ol flowers and of ears of corn. Meanwhile the crowd in the Champ de Mars was constantly increasing ; and soon it was sum moned bv beat of drum, and with all the usual formalities, to disperse. Nothing came of this demand except a shower of stones hurled at the National Guard. The regular troops, composed principally of Royal Guards, replied by firing wildly at all around them. The patriotic altar was soon covered with blood and surrounded by corpses. Robespierre, detained by his duties at the Revolutionary Tribunal, arrived late, at which there was some amusement. Dressed in the blue coat worn by the representatives of the people, and holding in his hand a bouquet of flowers and wheat, he exclaimed : \" 0 Nature, how delightful, how sublime is thy powerl How tyrants must tremble and grow pale ,1; the idea of such a Festival ! \" 'The crowd fled as rapidly as its numbers would permit, but it was now charged by cavalry, and afterwards fired into by artillery. To stop the carnage La Fayette rode up to the guns, himself exposed to their shots. The number of persons killed has, of course, been differently \u2014 very differently \u2014 estimated ; but according to a moderate computation, at least 1,500 persons were slain. General La Fayette, and Bailly, Mayor of Paris, had given a general order to repel force by force, and the responsibility of the massacre was ac cepted by Bailly. It was for this reason, indeed, that in November, 1703, he was sentenced to death, his execution taking place on the very scene of the massacre. After the founder of the new religion hau, in accordance with the programme, delivered his discourse, whence a few words have been cited, he walked down from the amphitheatre in company with his fellow-members ot the Convention. At the entrance to the Palace had been erected a pyramid consisting of dolls representing atheism, ambition, egotism, and false simplicity ; then came the rags ot misery, through which could ba seen the decorations and splendour of the slaves of Royalty Robespierre went forward with a torch and set fire to these impostures. When wretchedness and vice had been consumed, the statue Wisdom was discovered unfortunately a lit* scorched bv the flames in which its opposites had perished. The whole procession next moved the Champ de la Reunion, as the Champ de Mars was now called. The Convention marched in a body surrounded by a tricolour ribbon, which was carried by children, you: middle-aged men, and old men, all crowned with oak and myrtle-. No arms were worn, nu every deputy exhibited in token of bis miss a tricolour sash, and carried a feather 11 hat. In the centre of the procession eight When armies were being hastily formed for repelling the invasion of the German sovereigns the recruiting office was in the Champ de Mars, where amphitheatres were erected with flags bearing this inscription, \" Our country is in danger.\" On a table, supported by two drums, the- officers of the Municipality inscribed the names of those who wished to enlist, and the enthusiasm, now wide-spreading, gave to France fourteen armies, which, untrained as bodies, (though they contained numbers of trained men disbanded from the royal army) proved them selves valiant, and indeed invincible, in the field. The- next great festival which was held in the Champ de Mars was that of the Supreme Being. All that was done during the- Revolution against religion was aimed particularly at the clergy and the monks, the Inquisition and the stake. The celebration ofthe Festival of the Supreme Being had been fixed, according to the Revolutionary"], [263, "FRANCE'S FIRST RACE-COURSE. and Paris Exhibitions.) 235 oxen with gilded horn- drew an antique car bearing, a- tributes, instruments of art. When the Convention established itself on a sym bolical mountain, it was surrounded by the fathers and mothers sent officially by the sections ; also by their young daughters, crowned with roses, and older children adorned with violets. Everyone, moreover, in the procession wore national colours. in which the Duke of Angouleme, at the head of the army which had fought, or rather had executed a military promenade, in Spain. attacked some battalions playing the part of\" the Spanish army, which at the proper moment retreated. Then the high ground since known as the Trocadero was stormed, as the Trocadero of Spain had been stormed in the war just terminated ; and it was now that the idea was conceived of treating the Arc de Triomphe a- a triumphal arch erected to the glory of the arroy os Louis XVIII. Then there was a fresh discourse from Robespierre, after which hymns by Che'nier and -ties, with music by Gaveaux, were sung. The music of the hymns, from one or two specimens preserved, seems to have been poor, but given forth by thousands of voices it was doubtless impressive. After an invocation to the Eternal, the young girls strewed their flowers on the- ground, mothers raised their children in their arms, and old men stretched out their hands to bless the young ones, who iwore to die for their country and their liberty. Revolutionary in its origin, the Festival of the Supreme Being, celebrated throughout France, helped everywhere to raise the Catholic party ; which was not precisely what its founders had I at. Under the reign of Louis Philippe, the military representation of which under Louis XVIII. 's reign the Trocadero had been made the scene was repeated, with the replacement of the Trocadero by Antwerp. This display, on a very grand scale, was attended with a crush, a panic, and almost as many accidents as were caused by the celebrated fireworks on the Place- Louis XV., on the occasion of Marie Antoinette's marriage. It was under the Restoration that the Champ dc Mars was used as a course tor the first races, or at least the first races of a popular character, established in France. They were, after some v< ars, as already mentioned, transferred to Longchamps. Under the Second Empire, or rather when the Second Empire was about to be proclaimed, the Champ de Mars witnessed a magnificent review and distribution of eagles \u2014 the prelude, in fact, to the establishment of the imperial form of government. \" Take back these eagles,\" said the prince president on this occasion, \" not a- a symbol of threats against the foreigner, but as a recollection of an heroic epoch, as a sign of nobility for each regiment in the service. Take back these eagles which so often led your fathers to victory, and swear, if necessary, to die in their defence.\" This wa the last of the many political scenes of which the Champ de Mars has been the theatre. In 1867 it furnished a site for the annex or sup plementary building where, in connection with the Universal Exhibition of that year, the machinery was displayed. Another solemn festival was held in the Champ de Mars, to celebrate the capture of on from the English, as brought about by ing artillery officer named Bonaparte, whose name was being repeated from mouth to mouth by admirers as yet unable to foresee that the object of their admiration would before many years be the ruler of France ; for, \" born Republic,\" he was, in the energetic words of Chateaubriand, \"to kill his own mother.\" On the 3rd of December, 1X04, the day after oronation of the Emperor at Notre-Damc, damp de Mars was to be the scene of yet mother festival\u2014 the distribution of eagles among the different regiments of the French Army It was in the Champ de Mar- that Napoleon, alter his return from Elba, gave a banquet to 15,000 soldiers and National Guards ; and in the Champ dc Mar- that he assembled itions from all the army-corps and all the invoked to hear the promulga- -1 tin- \"additional Act\" which gave new :\" the old Napoleonic Constitution. ably known a- that of the 1 de Mai, .,, called from the month in it wa- held.

Before r 7 89 the industrial system of France, as of other countries, was made up of Corporations and guilds rigidly bound by rules and traditions ; and many industrial processes were so many secrets into which apprentices, duly articled, were initiated, but which were jealously guarded from the knowledge of the outer world. A general exhibition of arts, manufactures, and machinery would, under the ancient regime, have been in direct opposition to the spirit of the time ; it would have been impossible, that t- to -ay. When, however, guilds and corporations were broken up and labour was throughout the years after the Revolution ; and with a rapidity characteristic of the period it was at once carried out. Of some hundred exhibitors, nearly all belonged to Paris. But at a second exhibition held three years afterwards, thirty-eight depart ments, including some of the most distant ones, sent examples of their industry. shese ex hibitions were to be triennial ; though then recurrence at fixed intervals was snmetimes interfered with by political or military < The Industrial Exhibitions of France, however, increased in importance until, under tl of Louis Philippe, they took a prodigious devi lopment.

Then came th Universal Exhibition of 1S51, held in Huh"], [265, "THE EIFFEL TOWER. ihibilions.] 237 Park ; adorned for the occasion with a build- new architecture, to which Douglas (errold, writing in Punch, gave the name of \"Crystal Palace.\" In 1855 France, not to be outshone by England, opened in her turn a Universal Exhibition in the Champs Elysees, imitated in part from the glass structure designed by Sir Joseph Paxton, but less fairylike though, it may be, more substantial.

At its base the tower measures, on each four sides, 100 metres, and it slope- up platform at the summit which measures, on side, ten metres. Once invaded, the Champ de Mars was soon to be fully occupied, and the last and greatest ot the Paris Universal Exhibitions swallowed up the Champ de Mars without even finding its vast -pace sufficient. The desert of former days bad become the most frequented place in the world. More than that, it was now a spot where the whole world was represented \u2014 Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and Australasia, with their different human types, their animals, their plants, their minerals, their natural products, their industries, their sciences, and their fine arts. An immense number of buildings in every form, in every style, and ed' every period had been erected. Domes, steeples, towers, cupolas, min arets, and factory chimneys stood out against the clear sky of Paris ; and in the midst ot this confused architecture were seen the large green - ot the winter gardens. ddic first platform, with immense rooms fm different purposes, is sixty-six metres above the level of the soil ; just eight metres less than the towers of Notrc-Damc, and it preset surface of ;,ooo square metres. It ma reached cither by a staircase- of ;;o step-, a lift.

Here the Paris / established a printing office, whence issu, special edition of the Eiffel Figaro, in which were printed the names of all the visitors. The third platform, 276 metres in height, cai be reached by lift. It is surmounted by a campanile, or bell tower, in the Italian style, twenty-four metres in height, which is divided into apartments for scientific experiments, and which includes M. Eiffel's reception rooms. At the very top of the structure is a light, of the power employed in the great French lighthouses, The view from the Eiffel Tower becomes naturally more and more vast as one ascends ; and M. Eiffel has had maps drawn showing the points visible- from the- third, or highest platform, to the ordinary sight. This map is exhibited on the third platform. The whole, beheld from afar in a bird's-eye \\ icw, formed an enormous ellipsis, with the marveliOUS Eiffel 'Tower in the centre. M. Eiffel, a Fr inch engineer, whose name would seem to del ,e a German origin, proposed the tower with which his name is now for ever associated five years before the date fixed for the Universal Exhibition. He was already known by some important works, such as the great iron bridge at Bordeaux, and several other bridges in the south of France ; also by the Douro Viaduct, and by the bridge over the Szegedin Road, in Hungary. He had been employed in connection with the Universal Exhibition of 1867, where he had charge ill the machinery annex. ( in the north may be distinguished two villages in the department of the S01 seventy kilometres Irom Paris (four kilometres^ two-and-a-half miles) ; on the north-east the forest of Hallatte, at the back of Cenlis, di seventy-five kilometres ; on the cast two hills in the direction of Chateau Thierry eight kilometres ; on the south-east the em Fertc-Bcrnard, in the department of the Marne, eighty-two kilometres; on the south, the cither side of Etampes, sixty-two kilometres; mi the south-west the Cathedral of Chartres and a hill at the back, eighty-three kilometres; mi the west the Chateau of Versailles, the chap Dreux, and the- environs of Dourdan, at a distance of fifty kilometres; and finally c the north-west the forest of Lyon-. kilometres. The Americans had proposed to commemorate the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1875 by a tower one thousand feet in height, equal to about 305 French metres. But they abandoned the pro ject, which was to be realised by M. Eiffel, whose tower is within five metres of the height con templated by the architects and engineers of Philadelphia. The calculations for the Eiffel Tower, formed entirely of iron trellis work, had been so carefully made that when the component parts, prepared separately, were brought to the workshops of the Champ de Mars to be verified and adjusted, they fitted to the greatest per fection. To give an idea of the dimensions of the FCifFtl Tower it may be mentioned that the towers of Notre-Dame rise to a height of sixty-six metres above the level of the soil, while the Cathedral of Cologne, the loftiest in the world, does not exceed I -0 metres.

'The Eiffel Tower was one of the greatest attractions of the Exhibition of 1889 ; and it remains a lasting memorial of that greatest it exhibitions, which, on certain Sundays holidays, attracted a- many as 400,000 rs. It has been calculated that it received ther twenty-five million visitors \u2014 or, what quite the same thing, twenty-five million -which gives an average of 130,000 daily. Apart from the rich and varied interest belonging tu the manufactures, the works of art, the products of all kinds, natural and artificial, that were on view, the Exhibition possessed a high significance in a political sense. It showed to Eumpe- and to the world that France had more than recovered from the calamities of the war, and that she was once more in the very foremost rank of civilised powers. As in all exhibitions, leiitific departments attracted less attention, and were less frequented than the restaurants and the refreshment rooms ; though here, also, were opportunities for study, especially for ti I in ethnology. In England and other countries which are supposed to have attained the highest point of civilisation, the humbler classes know nothing of art work in connection with their daily life. But the Russian peasant, poor and uneducated, tasting meat once, perhaps, in a month, and living principally on black bread, salt cucumbers, dried mushrooms, and porridge, wears a costume full of colour, a red shirt, or a blue kaftan with a scarlet sash ; and he adorns in his own rough but picturesque fashion the house he lives 111, and every article of its modest furniture. The Russian peasant, like the peasant in other coun tries, makes none too frequent a use ot the towel ; but every towel that he possesses i ornamented with an embroidered fringe, worked by women who have never studied in any sort of art school, but who have acquired certain arts by tradition, and possibly through inherited aptitude. The Russian peasantry are still, for the most part, ignorant of reading and writing. But when the whole population of the Russian Empire is sent to school its native artistic faculties will, it is to be feared, disappear. At present the brain of the poor moujik must somehow occupy itself during his periods of leisure ; and it works for the most part\u2014 and exclusively when he happens to be quite un lettered \u2014 through eye and hand.

The so-called \"electors\" of Paris, themselves chosen the moment before from among the Paris population, had assembled under the presidency of M. de Flesselle-, provost of the merchants, when a report was spread that he had concealed several barrels of gunpowder in the cellars of the Hotel de Ville. This was looked upon as a reactionary measure intended to prevent the meditated attack on the hated stronghold ; and people rushed to the Hotel de Ville to distribute the powder at once and with their own hands. The Bastille had scarcely been taken when the captors, returning to the Hotel dc Ville, called out, \"Down with De Flesselles,\" who, attacked in the Hall of Assembly, escaped by a convenient door. He had scarcely, In iwever, got outside when he was recognised and shot dead. With the death of the Provost dc Flesselles the ancient corporation of the burgesses of Paris, with their privileges of holding courts, commercial, civil, and even criminal, came to an end. On its ruins was raised the Commune of Paris, which played so terrible a part in the Revolution, and especially during the Reign of Terror. The Hotel de Ville has been called the \" palace of revolution,\" and during the last hundred years, ever since the era of revolutions set in, it has well deserved its name. The Hotel de Ville served as head quarters to the Commune of Paris, and to the Committee of Public Safety. The registers of the Commune are still preserved in the Archives, and furnish the only authentic materials relating to the history of the most sanguinary period of the French Revolution. L'nder the Consulate and the Empire the municipal power, like the legislative power, was abolished ; and the Tinted de Ville was now only known as the scene from time to time of public entertainments. Crowds were in the habit ot assembling before the Hotel de Ville to hear the victories of Napoleon pro claimed. On the occasion of the Emperor's marriage to Marie Louise the City of Paris revived the entertainments which it had been in the habit of giving to the ancient kings. Napoleon expressed a desire to present his wife to the burgesses of Paris assembled in the rooms of the Hotel de Ville, which from this time, as long as the Empire lasted, gave an annual ball on the 1 5 tin of August. sculpture which have no sort of connection with the building. The Hotel de Ville has an interesting history of its own. In 141 1 Charles VI. restored to the Paris municipality, in acknowledgment of the courage shown by the Parisians against the English, several privileges which had been abolished or had fallen into abeyance. Then, during the trouble- of the Armagnacs and the Burgundians, the Paris Municipality broke into two hostile faction- ; but at length, from hatred of the Armagnac party, the municipality accepted the English domination. After the return, however, of Charles VII. and during the whole of the second half of the fifteenth century the magistrates of the capital showed themselves thoroughly loyal and absolutely devoted to the interests of the monarchy. Louis XII. and Francis I. respected and even tented the- privileges of the Hotel de Ville. But during the religious wars the municipality again split up into two factions. It took part, -hide, in the massacre of St. Bartholomew, believing that it was thus helping to suppress ted against the life of the king ; but it made every effort to stop bloodshed when it understood the- true character of the infamous attack upon the Huguenots. Towards the end of cteenth century the municipal officers were :i from among the most determined sup porters of the Catholic League ; in spite of wdlich the Hotel de Ville made every effort to bring Henri IV to Pali-.

After the breakdown of the Second Empire and the flight of the Empress from Paris, the Government of National Defence, consisting of all the Paris Deputies, had its head-quarters at the Hotel de Ville ; and here, when the so-called government had given place to the Central Committee, and the Central Committee- to the Commune, the last-named body held its delibera tions. In [875 the Hotel de Ville was recon structed, with certain modifications and ampli fications, on the lines of the ancient one, burned down by the Communards. The new edifice contains either in niches, or on external pinnacles, rather more than 100 statues, repro ducing the features of all kinds of celebrities, the whole of them belonging to France, with the single exception of Cortone, born in Italy. The collection includes the architects of the original building, some of the most famous merchant provosts, mayors of Paris, prefects of the Seine, and municipal councillors, among whom may be mentioned Michel Lallier, who delivered Paris from the English, Francois Miron, and Pierre Viole.

So much at least has been inferred, apart from the tradition on the subject, from the fact that when some years ago the building was reconstructed, Roman remains were discovered in the founda tions. All, however, that can be affirmed with historical certainty a- to the origin of the Palace is that towards the end of the ninth century it existed in the form of a fortress, and wa- the residence of the Franki-h kings of the see, mil race. It played an important part in the- defence of Paris against the Normans invading the city by water from Rouen and the lower Seine. At the Palais de Justice lived the Counts of Paris, and afterwards the kings of the line which came to an end with the unfortunate \" Louis Capet\" (a- in Revolutionary parlance he was called l who lost his head beneath the guillotine. Philip the Fair enlarged the Palace; and under his reign the Parliament, formerly \" ambulatory,\" became sedentary : it no 1 that is to say, followed the king in his joui from one residence to another. The members of Parliament had lodgings assigned to them in that part of the building now occupied by the prison of the Conciergerie. Under the reign of Charles V. the first great cluck that had ever been seen in France was placed m a square tower on the quay ; whence the name \"Ouai de l'Horloge.\" It was in the Palais de Justice that Charles VI. received the Greek Emperor, Manuel Pal\u00e6ologus, and the Emperor Sigismund, Kingr of Hungary. A strange incident happi connection with the visit of the latter so He had expressed a desire to witness the pleading of a case before the Parliament, and at the beginning of the process astonished 1 by taking the seat reserved for the King oi France. One of the parties to the suit was about to lose his action on the ground that he was not a nobleman, whereupon, in a spirit of equity and chivalry, not appreciated by tin assembly, Sigismund rose from his Si calling to him the pleader, who, from no fault of his own, wa- getting defeated, made him a knight ; which completely changed the aspect of affairs, and enabled the man who was in the right to gain his case. It was at the Palace of Justice that tin marriage of Henry V. of Englan Catherine of France, daughter of Cha was celebrated. Here, too, Henrv VI. England, resided at the time of his coronation as King of France. Under the reign ot VII. certain clerks, \"les clercs <(e la obtained permission to represent \"sai moralities\" in the great banqueting hall, at immense marble table at one of the extremities of the hall serving as stage. According tc writer of the time, this table was \"so long,\" Louis le Gros, the protector of the Communes, died at the Palace in 1137. Philip Augustus, while undertaking the entire reconstruction of the Chateau du Louvre, made the Palace his habitual residence, and it was there that he married Ingelburga, sister of Canute, King of Denmark. Under the reign id\" this monarch, the court or tribunal of the- King received for the first time the name of Parliament, its functions being to discuss and decide questions submitted to it by the Sovereign, and to pro nounce on the illegality or legality of certain acts. In these days the royal residence was not luxuriously furnished, hay doing duty for carpet during the winter, and a matting of weeds during the summer. These primitive coverings of the palatial floors were given by Philip Augustus to tbe hospital known a- the Hotel-Dieu when ever the Court left Paris. The King's Palace was called the Palace of Justice from the fact that here the Sovereign held Court, and decided the cases submitted to him by his subject-, sometimes with, some times without, the assistance of the before-men tioned Parliament.

In ,22i the students of the university, en couraged by the privileges granted to them by Philip Augustus, gave themselves up to all kinds of excesses, carrying away women and com mitting outrages, thefts, and murders ; where upon Bishop Guillaume pronounced excom munication against all who went about by night or day with arms. As the decree of ex communication produced little effect, the bishop caused the most seditious to be put in prison, and drove the others out of the town, thus re-establishing tranquillity. \u20221, however, the clerks attached to the Palace of Justice reappeared on the marble table ; when they again got themselves into trouble by satirising the Government of Charles VIII., and even Charles himself. Several of the authors and actors concerned in the piece were imprisoned, and were only liberated at the instance of the Bishop of Paris, who claimed for them \" benefit of clergy.\" In 1 221 a violent quarrel and disturbance broke out between the scholars and the inhabit ants. Three hundred and twenty students were killed and thrown into the Seine. Several professors went to the Pope to complain of so cruel a persecution ; and some of them with drew, with their students, from the capital. Paris was interdicted ; and its schools, so superior to those of the other towns of France, remained without professors or scholars, and were closed. The clerks of the tribunals and the students of tbe university were, in those days, troublesome folk. The students have always formed .111 exceptional class in Paris. Unlike the uni- v students in England, they live in the capital, are exposed to its temptations, and take part in its struggles. During the present century in commotions and insurrections they have always been on the lar side. In former times, however, they formed a party in themselves ; and the students 'aris would engage with the citizens in formidable contests, which, with exaggerated features, resembled the \"town and gown\" rows hich our own universities have so often been the scene. During the thirteenth century there was as much credulity and fanaticism as there was anarchy in Paris. This was fully shown when a new sect, composed entirely of priests, declared itself. Its members denied the Real Presence, looked upon most of the ceremonies of the Church as useless, and ridiculed the worship of saints and relics. They addressed themselves particularly to women, persuading them that nothing they did was sinful so long as it was done from charity. \"In the year 1200,\" says the author of \u25a0iilarites Historiques,\" \"a German gentle man studying at Paris sent his servant to a tavern to buy some wine. The servant was maltreated, whereupon the German students in the aid of their fellow-countryman, and I the wine-dealer so roughly that they left him nearly dead.

The disciples he left behind him were nearly all ecclesiastics, or professors of the University of Paris. There was, however, one goldsmith among them, who, we are assured, uttered prophecies. To discover the members of this sect a stratagem was employed. Raoul de Nemours and another priest pretended to share the opinions of the heretics, that they might after wards denounce them.

The royal sanction was then obtained ; but Louis Philippe did not remain long enough on the throne to see the work of construction terminated. The Republican Gov ernment of 1X48 stopped the building; and it was only under the Second Empire in 1854 that it was resumed, to be completed in 1868.

Enclosed on the east by the Boulevard du Palais, on the west by the Rue dc Harlay, on the north by the Ouai de l'Horloge, and on the south bv the Ouai des Orfevres, it forms a quadrilateral mass in which all styles arc opposed and confused, from the feudal towers of the Ouai de l'Horloge to the new buildings begun in Napoleon III.'- reign, but never completed. To the left of this strange agglomeration the air is pierced bv the graceful spire of the Sainte-Chapelle, admirable monument of the piety and ofthe art ofthe middle ages. Sonic portions of the ancient Palace of Justice are preserved in the modern edifice, but only the substructures, as, for instance, in the northern building- faeing the Seine. The principal gate, and the central pavilion with its admirable facade at the bottom of the courtyard opening mi to the Boulevard du Palais, were constructed under the reign of Louis XVI. The northern portion, from the clock tower, at the corner of the quay, to the third tower behind, has been restored or rebuilt in the course of the last thirty year-. All the rest of the building is absolutely new. The clock tower, a fine specimen of the military architecture of the fourteenth century, was furnished in 1370 lw order of Charles V. with the first large clock that had been seen in Parb-, the work of a German, called in France Henri de Vic. To this clock the northern quay owes it- name of \"Ouai de l'Horloge du Palais\" or \"Ouai de l'Horloge.\" The bell suspended in the upper part of the tower is said to have sounded the signal for the massacre of the Protestants on the eve of St. Bartholo mew's Day, August 24, 1572 ; a doubtful honour, which is also claimed for the bell of Saint-Germain -l'Auxerrois.

The evidence against Cazotte was only too clear, and he was con demned to death ; which suggested the epigram that \" Judges struck where executioners had spared.\" But these very judges, bound by inflexible laws, could not refuse the expression of their pity and esteem to the unhappy old man. While condemning him to death they rendered homage to his honesty and his courage. \" Why,\" exclaimed the public accuser, \" after a virtuous life of seventy-two years, must you now be declared guilty? Because it is not sufficient to be a good husband and a good father ; because one must also be a good citizen.\" The President ofthe Court, in pronouncing sentence, said with gravity and emotion: \"Old man, regard the approach of death without fear.

In their present condil and form, however, they take us back only to the year 1 S 3 7 . During forty -six years (1 to 1837) the Holy Chapel wtis given up to kinds of uses. First it was a club-house, then a flour magazine, and finally a bureau for offi documents. This last was the least injurion- et the purposes to which it was turned. Never theless the incomparable stained glass windows were interfered with by the construction of various boxes and cupboards along the of the building, no less than threi the lower part of each window being thus sacri ficed. Certain glaziers, moreover, employ take down the windows, clean them, and put them back, had made serious mistakes, portions of windows to the wrong frames.

Gerante died before he? ning his work, which, thereupon, was divi e lofty; and for the last six centuries it has resisted every cause of destruction, including the fire which, in 1630, threatened the entire building. No more beautiful specimens of stained glass arc to be seen than in the Holy Chapel, with its immense windows resplendent in rich and varied colours. A remarkable statue of the Virgin bowing her head as if in token of assent, now at the Hotel Cluny, belonged originally to the Holy Chapel. According to a pious legend, the figure bent forward to show approval of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception as formulated bv Duns Scotus, who was teaching theology at Paris in 1304, and from the time ot the miracle until now maintains the same gesture of inclination. More than one medi\u00e6val tradition makes statues, and especially statue- of the Virgin, perform similar action-. There is, for example, in the Contcs Divots a story of a statue of the Virgin to which a certain bourgeois qui aimait une dame prayed that she would cither make the lady return his love or cause that love to cease. Some time previously a Hebrew magician had offered to secure the lady's affections for the infatuated bourgeois provided he would renounce God, the saints, and especially the 111, -sed Virgin ; to which the despondent lover replied that though, in his grief and despair, he might abandon everything else, yet nothing could make him relinquish his allegiance and devotion to the Blessed Virgin. This fidelity, under all temptations, gave him some right, he hoped, to implore the influence of the merci ful Virgin towards softening the heart of the woman he so passionately loved ; and the statue ofthe Virgin, before which he prostrated himself, showed by a gentle inclination of the head that hi- prayer was heard. Fortunately, the lady whose cold demeanour had so vexed the- heart of her lover was in the church at the very moment of the miracle, and, seeing the- Virgin bow her head to the unhappy bourgeois, felt convinced that he must be an excellent man. Thereupon she went up to him, asked him why he looked so sad, reproached him gently with not having visited her of late, and ended by assuring him that if he still loved her she fully returned his affection.

There is a reason, however, for placing the Sapeurs-pompier- under the orders of the Minister oi War. During the campaign of 1N70 and 1S71 the Germans refused to recognise the military character of corps not holding their commission from this minister. Thu- the National Guards, as a purely civic body, were not looked upon as soldiers, and were threatened with the penalties inflicted on persons taking up arms without authority from the central military power. In the next war against Germany the- French propose to call out the whole of their available forces ; and to be recog nised as regular troops the Sapcurs-poinpicrs must have a military organisation and act under military chiefs formally appointed and responsible to a superior officer. All this, however, could surely be accomplished without rendering tin corps unfit for the special duties assigned to it. The- Prefect of Police has beneath his orders all the police of the capital, or rather of the department to which the capital belongs. This service is divided into two special organisations: Municipal Police and Agents of Security. The \" Security \" force consists of three hundred agents with the title of inspector, command five chief inspectors, ten brigadiers, and K sub-brigadiers. These agents are employed in arresting malefactors, and are viewed with intense hatred by the criminal class gen The Municipal Police counts an effect i about ,X,ooo men, commanded by 38 officers, 25 chief inspectors, 100 brigadiers, and 700 sub-brigadiers.

It is doubtless sincere, but there is no way of testing it.\" The Barracks of the Prefecture are occupied by the Garde Republicaine, which succeeds the Garde de Paris, the latter having itself succeeded the Garde Municipalc, which was simply the Gendarmerie Royale of the Town of Paris, 1 under the Restoration.

But in principle the system described by -Mercier more than a hundred years ago still exists. \" This,\" writes that faithful chronicler, \" may be termed the second part of Parisian grievances. Yet, like even the most poisonous reptile, these bloodhounds are of some service to the community: they form a mass of corruption which the police distil, as it were, with equal art and judgment, and, by mixing it with a few salutary ingredients, soften its baneful nature, and turn it to public advantage. The dregs that remain at the bottom of the still are the spies of whom I have just spoken ; for these also belong to the police. The distilled matter itself consists of the thief-catchers, etc. They, like other spies, have persons to watch over them ; each is foremost to impeach the other, and a base lucre is the bone of contention amongst those wretches, who are, of all evils, the most necessary. Such arc the admirable- regulations of the Paris police that a man, if suspected, is so closely watched that the most minute transaction in which he is con- cerned is treasured up till it is fit time to arrest him. The police doe- not confine its care to the capital only. Droves of its runners are sent to the principal towns and cities in this kingdom, where, by mixing with those whose character is suspicious, they insinuate themselves into their confidence, and by pretending to join in their mischievous schemes, get sufficient information to prevent their being carried into execution. The- mere narrative of the following fact, which happened when M. dc Sartine was at the head of this department, will give the reader an idea ofthe watchfulness of the police.

The traveller was both astonished and frightened at this peremptory command, which, however, it would have been imprudent to disobey. He went, and his tears soon subsided at the civil reception he met with ; but his surprise was greatly increased when the magistrate, whom, to his knowledge, he had never seen before, calling him by his name, gave him an ac count of every transaction that had taken place pre vious to the gentleman's departure from Bordeaux, and even minutely de scribed the full contents of his portmanteau. 'Now, -ir,' continued the Lieutenant de Police, ' to show that I am well informed I have a trifle more to disclose to you. You are going to such and such an hotel, and a scheme is laid by your servant to murder you by ten o'clock.' 'Then, my lord, I must shift my quarters to defeat his wicked intention.' 'By no means, sir ; you must not even take notice of what I have said. Retire to bed at your usual hour, and leave the rest to me.' Idle gentleman fol lowed the advice of the magistrate and went to the hotel. About an hour after he had lain down, when, no doubt, he was but little inclined to compose himself to rest, the servant, armed with a clasp-knife, entered secret agents.

To go back from history to legend, it was IN the matter of police administration and of civic government generally, the Hotel de Ville is to the whole of Paris what the Mansion House and the Guildhall are to that part of London known specially as the City. The Hotel de Ville has charge, moreover, of all the Paris hospitals and benevolent institutions. The general administration of the hospitals is en trusted to a Director, under the surveillance ot a Consultative Committee. The most ancient and most celebrated ot all the Paris hospital- is the Hotel-Dieu, occupying a space which i.- hounded on the north by the Quai aux Fleurs, on the south by the Place du Parvis, on the west by the Rue de la Cite, and on the east by the Rue d'Arcole. The Place du Parvi- deserves a word of mention to itself. The word \" Parvis \" has several derivations, the most popular of which i- fnnn the Latin paradisus. The ancient form of the French word wnsfarais ox par avis, contracted into parvis ; and it was applied to the open space in front of a church because, in the days of the \"mysteries,\" it was here that the paradise of the play was located. According to another derivation, the \" parvis \" is the ground outside a church which \"pare\" or \"guard-\" the principal door \u2014 huis in the ancient French. In this sense the word is used to denote, in the Jewish Temple, the- space around the tabernacle. Parvis celeste is a phrase employed by French poets to signify heaven or the firmament ; which does not at all prove \u2014 indeed seems to disprove \u2014 that parvis means, or ever did mean, the same thing as paradisus. The parvis of the old churches was, in any case, used as a place of penance for those who had scandalised the town by some offence against good moral-; and it wa- there that on certain occasions holy relics were brought for exhibition to the people. The temple- of Greece and Rome were surrounded by enclosures, a- if to separate them from the public thoroughfare ; and the first Christian churches had enclosure- in front of the principal entrance, where tombs, crosses, statue,-, and sometimes fountains were to be seen.

Gaul was at that time governed for the Emperor Leo by the Tribune Flollo, who retired to Paris and there kings and princes of Britain. He wished at the same time to consecrate the memory of his triumph, and accordingly erected on the very ground where the combat had taken place a chapel in honour of the Virgin, which at last be came the cathedral church of Paris.

In old French, the second of two substantives joined together did duty as genitive ; so that Hotel-Dieu signified the hotel (or house) of God, just as in -omc ancient French towns Mere-Dieu, a- the sign of an hotel, meant not, as is some time- ignorantly supposed, \"God the Mother,\" but \"The Mother of God.\" The Hotel-Dieu or Hotel de Dieu (a house, that is to say, 111 which the poor and suffering were received and attended in the name of God and under His auspices) was founded about 600, in the time of Clovis II. , son of Dagobert, by Saint Landri, twenty-eighth bishop of Paris. Here he was accustomed to receive, at his own expense, not only sick people, but also beggars and pilgrims. Medicus et Hospes, such was the motto of the bishop, who might justly claim the double title of physician and host. In the course of centuries the good work begun by Saint Landri was continued on a large scale by the French kings, with Philip Augustus, Saint Louis, and Henri IV. prominent among them. Among the benefactors of the Hotel-Dieu must also be mentioned the Chancellor du Prat, and the first President, Pomponne de Bellievre. The general plan of the Hotel-Dieu as it now stands comprises two masses of parallel build ings : one beside the Parvis of Notre Dame, the other alongside the Ouai Napoleon ; the- two facades, anterior and posterior, of the edifii connected laterally by galleries at right angles to the Seine. The administrative department of the Hotel-Dieu is in that part of the building which faces the Parvis.

In 1868 a new hospital was begun just opposite the old one; and the building as it now stands, large, airy, and in every respect commodious, was finished in is;s. With abundance of space- at their command, the architects of the modern Hotel- Dieu made it their sole aim to secure for the patients every possible advantage, and their first care was to provide spacious wards replete with light and air. One result has been that in a larger edifice the number of the beds has, in accordance with the best hygienic principles, been greatly diminished. In the time of Saint Louis the old Hotel-Dieu received 000 patients. This number was in creased under Henri IV. to 1,300, and under Louis XIV. to 1,900. At time.-, however, the sick or wounded persons admitted were far more numerous ; and in 1700 the number of patients in the Hotel-Dieu is said to have reached Q,ooo. Not, however, the number of beds ; for in the same- bed several patients, at the risk of infection, contagion, and frightful mortality, were placed together. The new Hotel-Dieu, on the other hand, contains only 1:14 beds : 329 medical beds, ativice.

In this abode of human misery every aspect is cruel and dis gusting ; and this is called the House of God ! Who would not fly from the bloody, detested spot ? Who will venture within a house where the bed of mercy is far more dreadful than the naked board on which lies the poorest wretch ? This hospital, miscalled Hotel-Dieu, was founded by Saint Landri and Comte Ar chambaud in the year 660 for the reception of sick persons of either sex. Jews, Turks, and infidels have an equal right to admission. There are 1,200 beds, and constantly between five and six thousand patients. What a disproportion! Yet the revenues of the hospital are immense. It was expected that the last fire which happened in this edifice would have been improved to the advantage of the patients, by the construction, on a healthier spot, of a new and more extensive structure. But no ; everything remains on the same footing ; though it is but too well proved that the Hotel-Dieu has every requisite to create and increase a multitude of disorders on account of the dampness and confinement of the atmo sphere. Wounds soon turn to a mortification ; whilst the scurvy makes the greatest havoc amongst those who, from the nature of their maladies, are forced to remain there for some time. Thus, the most simple distempers soon grow into complicated diseases, sometimes fatal, ihe contagion of that ambient air. Both the experience and observation of the naturalist concur to prove that a hospital which contains above one hundred beds is of itself a plague. It may be added that as often as two patients are laid up in the same room they will evidently hurt each other, and that such a practice is necessarily injurious t\" the law- of humanity. It is almost incredible, yet not the les.- true, Visitors to the Hotel-Dieu, a- to other hos pitals in Paris, cannot tail to observe that the less pure in the men's than in the women's ward-.

Persons of the highest rank meant simply the condition of being without employment ; and it was on the Place de Greve that artisans who found, like Othello, their occu pation g, me, assembled in search of an em ployer. Afterwards this became a place ot execution ; and here it was that Ravaillac, Cartouche, Damiens, and such illustrious \\ictinis as the Constable of Saint-Pol under Louis XL, and Lally-Tollendal under Louis XVI., were decapitated, quartered alive, and otherwise tortured. \" La fourne'e sera rude,\" said Damiens, when, having already undergone various tortures, he learned that he was to be torn to piece- by four horses; and \"rough\" indeed have been the dav- passed by the unhappy wretches brought to punishment on the Place de Greve. After the Revolution of 1830, when the Hotel de Ville became all at once a place of high political importance, the open .-pace in front of it was looked upon as unworthy any longer to serve a- a slaughter-ground, and the Place Saint-Jacques now became the head-quarter- ot the guillotine ; which was afterwards to be- trans ferred to the Place de la Roquette. The region of Paris commanded by the Hotel clc Ville forms a long irregular parallelogram, comprising, for the most part, the districts of Saint-Mery, Saint- Gervais and the Arsenal, bounded on the south by the Seine, on the west by the Place du Chatelet and the Boulevard Sebastopol, on the east by the Saint-Martin Canal and the Boule vard Bourdon, 011 the north by the Rue de Rivoli and the- Rue Saint-Antoine, rejoining the Boulevard Bourdon at the Place de la Bastille. To the construction of the Rue de Rivoli is due the happy change which has taken place in this populous region, formerly deprived of light and air, and so overcrowded that the in habitants were always suffering from some serious epidemic. The streets of the neighbourhood must at that time have been good specimens of those so energetically condemned by Arthur Young in one of his descriptions of Paris. \"This great city,'' he wrote in the very year ot the- Revolution, \"appears to be in many respects the most ineligible and inconvenient for the residence of a person of small fortune of any that I have seen ; and vastly inferior to London. The streets arc- very narrow and many of them crowded, nine-tenths dirty, and all without foot-pavements.

This statue replaces the ancient one which the Revolutionists of 1703 precipitated on to the pavement, though they respected the symbolical animals placed at the lour corners of the balustrade. These have been carefully restored. From the height of the platform a magnificent view may be obtained. \"One sees,\" wrote Sanval under Louis XIV., \"as one looks over the town the distribution and course of the streets like the veins in the human body. Unfortunately this incomparable view can no longer be obtained \u2014 not at least without much difficulty. The tower of Saint- Jacques has been put in the hands of an astro nomical and meteorological society, which denies access to the public, though on rare occasions it admits a few favoured persons to its experi ments, which take place at night.\" Napoleon I. began the Rue de Rivoli, tracing it alongside the Tuileries Gardens and the Palais Royal to the Louvre as far as the Rue dc Rohan. Napoleon III. continued the great conception of hi- uncle and pushed on the Rue dc Rivoli through the mean habitations and crowded streets ill the neighbourhood of the Palais I, of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois, and of the Halle- a- far as the upper part of the Rue Saint-Antoine. It must here be mentioned that at the foot of the tower is a statue of Pascal, who continued from its top the observations he had begun from the summit of the Puy de Dome. The writer Nicholas Flamel, librarian to the Uni versity of Paris, and Pernelle, his wife, both buried in the vaults of Saint-Jacques-la-Bou cherie, had been the benefactors of this church ; and their memory is preserved in the name, Nicholas Flamel, given to the street which, beginning on the right of the tower, leads from the Rue dc Rivoli to the Rue des Lombards. The most celebrated, and certainly the most beautiful, monument in the street is the tower nt-Jacques-la-Boucherie ; so named from its having been built close to the great butchers' market of Paris. Constructed in 1153, the church, which at first was little more than a chapel, wa- rebuilt in 13,^0, but not completed with the principal porch and the tower until the reign of Francis I. The tower is now all that remains of the church, which in 1737, the Revolution, was alienated by the Administration of Domain- and soon afterwards pulled down.

The students who, at the close of day, were accustomed to amuse themselves in the Pre-aux-Clercs opposite the Louvre, replaced their ordinary songs by the psalms of Clement Marot ; and it became the fashion with the lords and ladies of the court to cross the Seine in order to hear the singing of the \"clerks.\" Often they would themselves join in, and the Huguenot King of Navarre, Antoine de Bourbon, was frequently seen singing the psalms in the \"meadow\" at the head of a long procession of courtiers and students. ri II. imitated his father.

To gratify his own private tastes as a bibliophile, M. de Paulmy had got together a library of about 100,000 volumes and 10,000 manuscripts, which was increased by the addition of upwards of 26,000 works from the sale of the Duke de la Valliere's collection. To prevent the dispersion of the books after his death, M. de Paulmy sold the collection in 1783 to the Count of Artois for a certain number of annuities, which the Count omitted to pay. The library was, all the same, looked upon as government property, and confiscated as such in 1700. Enriched by the confiscation of other libraries in the neighbour- It was at the Arsenal, when Charles Xiulicr was librarian, that Victor Hugo, in the 1111,1-1 of a great literary gathering, recited his first poems, soon afterwards to be given to the world under the title of \" ( )des et Ballad A complete list of the writers wlu> ha pied the post of librarian at the Arsenal would include Ancelot, Paul Lacroix (better known as Lc Bibliophile Jacob), Edouard Thierry, Hippo lyte Lucas, and the Viscount de Bornier, author of \"La Fille de Roland,\" \"Agamemnon,\" \" Attila,\" and \"Mahomet.\" Among the interesting places in the neigh bourhood of the Arsenal must be mentioned the little covered market to which the name of Ave Maria has been given.

The Island of Saint-Louis, between the lie Louviers, which precedes it above bridge, and the Island of the City, which follows it below, was nothing but pasture-land until the beginning mis XIII.

In 1014 Christophe Marie, al constructor of the bridges of France, undertook to connect these two islets, to fur nish them with streets and with a circum ference of stone quays, and to join the whole to the right bank by a bridge leading to the Kne des X, nin. un- d'Hyeres.

The Church of Saint-Louis was begun in 1004 by Louis Le Van, continued by Gabriel Leduc, and completed in 17:0 by Jacques Doucct, who constructed the cupola. The steeple, thirty metre- high, is built of stone, and is in the form of an obelisk. ornamental sculpture is the work of Jean Champaigne, nephew of the painter, Philippe de Champaigne. The church contains Huntings by Mignard, Coypel, Lemoine, and Eugene Delacroix. and of M. Dupin, another farmer-general, brother ofthe celebrated Mine. d'Epinay. 'Lhe internal decorations suffered much from these constant changes of ownership. At the death of M. de La Have, the painting on the ceiling of one ofthe room-, \"Apollo listening to the prayer ol Phaeton,\" by Lesueur, was removed from the Hotel Lambert to the Luxembourg Gallery, where it may still be seen. Most of the other paintings were transferred, at the time of the Revolution, to the Louvre. Many distinguished persons have resided at the Hotel Lambert, including Voltaire when he was writing the \" Hcnriadc \" ; and it was here that M. de Montalivet, in i S i 5 , after the battle of Waterloo, had a celebrated interview with Napoleon. Later on the Hotel Lambert became a girls' school ; then a depot for military stores ; until finally, towards 1 N40, it was offered for sale, and purchased by Prince Czartoryski, to whose family it still belongs. The Ouai d'Anjou, which looks towards the north, is rich in associations of various kinds. The facade of Number 17 bears these words inscribed on a marble slab, \" Hotel de Lauzun, 1657\"; and beyond the principal door this other inscription : \" Hotel de Pimodan.\" Lieut. - General Count de Pimodan was the first in habitant of this hotel, which was built for him in 1657, and which he occupied until the time of his fall. It was the abode of the Marquis de La Vallee de Pimodan at the time of the Revolution. Under the reign of Louis Philippe a number of distinguished writers lived success ively or simultaneously in the mansion: Roger de Beauvoir, who published a collection of tales called \"The Hotel Pimodan\"; TheophileGautier, Charles Baudelaire, and others.

The shares were readily taken and the bank proved a great success. and not finished until 10 12, under the minority of Louis XIII. Constructed in the form of a Latin cross, the Church of Saint-Merry has two lateral entrances. But from the south side, that is to say, from the Rue dc la Verrerie, only a gate of the principal entrance can be seen, together with the two turrets terminating in hell towers, along which \"chim\u00e6ras dire \".are crawling. Buried under the Church of Saint- Merry are Chapclain, author of \"La Pucelle,\" and the Marquis dc Pomponne, .Minister ot Louis XIV. To the north of Saint-Merry stood the cloister of the canons, separated from the church bv the facade of the Rue du Cloitre, and by two narrow little streets bearing the expressive names of Briscmiche and Taillepain, on account of the daily distributions of bread of which they were the scene. At the back of the church the name of the Rue des Juges- Consuls recalls the fact that the first Tribunal of Commerce created by Charles IX. was installed there in a mansion which had belonged to Pre sident Baillet in 1570. The Tribunal of Commerce was, in the seventeenth century, the centre of a group of money-changers and bankers, who so infested the Rue Saint-Martin and the Rue Quincampoix as to render them impassable. Then, in connection with the bank, Law started successively the Mississippi Company, the Senegal Company, the China Company, the French East India Company, and companii coining the State money and farming the State revenue. Having now got into his han,: the sources of public income, he made - bank to the State, and was himself appointed Controller-General of Finance. Instead, how ever, of helping commerce, Law' merely stimulated the spirit of speculation ; so that priests, nobles, merchants, shopki 1 workmen, all began to gamble in stocks and shares. Intoxicated by his success, Law i an excessive number of shares: \"watering\" them, according to the financial expression of the- present clay. In due time, notwithstanding all kinds of expedients (such as forced currency for the new paper money) to keep them at par, the shares lost value in the market, and soon fell to such a point that their depreciation caused a general panic. There was no in which some, and, indeed, many ot haw's shareholders were not to be- found ; and erelong the inventor ofthe new system of credit I\" the object of so much public indignation that he went in danger of his life.

This method of appeasing the stormy waters was tried tt next day with less success by Law's coachman.

Law (John Lauriston Law) was born at Edinburgh in [671, and he is said at an early age to have studied assiduously the doctrine of chances, which he applied to games of hazard. Whether in virtue of his arithmetical combina tions or of that luck which during a long course of years never deserted him, he won -urns of money at the gambling-table, after which he turned his attention to gambling on a wider scale : finance, that is to say. He was still in his twenty-fifth year when, as the result of a love affair, he fought a duel, for which he was sentenced to death. His punishment was commuted to that of imprisonment for life ; but he succeeded in escaping, left England, and for some time travelled through the differ ent states of Europe, playing everywhere with success, and proposing everywhere, but without success, a new system of public credit, due to hi- inexhaustible imagination. The system would, according to its inventor, multiply one hundredfold the resources of the- State by putting into circulation a quantity of paper money, based upon the revenue from"], [327, "JOHN LAURISTON LAW.

A famous intermediary of the Rue Quincampoix was a certain hunchback, who used to let out his hump as a desk for buyers, sellers, and dealers of all kinds. In a comparatively short time he is said to have realised as much as 50,000 francs. Another carriage story of the same period, likewise associated with finance, has a less tragic conclusion. A footman who had learnt, by listening to the conversation of his master at dinner-table, the art of speculating, had at last made a sufficiently large fortune to be able to buy himself a carriage. As soon as he had a of it, he paid a visit to the Rue Quincampoix, a narrow street near the Rue Saint-Martin, where the bankers, brokers, and speculators interested in Law's various enterprises had their headquarters. After transacting a little business, the enriched flunkey entered a much-frequented cafe and refreshed himself. Some time afterwards, in a fit of absence due either to preoccupation or to the effect of alcoholic liquors, he left the cafe and, instead of getting into his carriage, got up behind it. \"You have made a mistake, sir, \"called out the coachman ; \" your place is inside.\" \"I know it is,\" replied the proprietor ofthe vehicle, suddenly recovering his presence of mind ; \" I wanted to see whether there was room for a pair of lacquevs behind.\" When the financial crash arrived, it was felt necessary to punish someone, and proceedings were taken against Law by the Parliament of Paris. Law, as completely ruined as the most unfortunate of his victims, escaped to Belgium, and thence to England, to die ultimately in Italy. \" When I took service in France,\" he wrote to the Duke of Orleans, \" I had as much property as I needed. I was without debts and I had credit ; I left the service without property of any kind. Those who placed confidence in me have been driven to bankruptcy, and I have not the means of paying them.\" At the time of his great failure, and for a long time afterwards, if not to the present day, Law was looked upon as a mere swindler ; whereas he was nothing worse than a sanguine, over confident, perhaps even reckless speculator. It has been seen that bv his speculations he im poverished himself as well as others. It footmen became aristocrats, noblemen, in ' iive days, turned tradesmen.

Law thought he could remove this difficulty by joining to his mechanism an arti ficial motive power. He was wrong. The banks can no more found credit than credit can produce capital. They can turn to the best account a value that exists. But to create value is beyond their power.\" According to another French economist, M. Levasseur, \" Law acted with the precipita tion and violence of a man who, penetrated with the truth of his own ideas, marches straight towards his goal without caring whether the generality of persons understand him or not, and who becomes irritated when natural obstacles present themselves which he had not foreseen.\" an 11. lined Languedoc, sent by his Rue Quincampoix to sell some at a fixed rate, disposed of them for 500,000 francs more than the appointed price, arted as a gentle- nnt, engaged servants d hi- name to that of Monsieur tide, by which he was thenceforth Law himself, while asserting his own moral integrity, admitted that he had made mistakes. \" I do not maintain,\" he -aid, \"that I was right on every point.

THE Rue Quincampoix and the Rue Saint- Martin are connected by a narrow lane or alley scarcely ten feet wide, called Rue de Venise, which has a sinister renown in connection with the speculative mania of Law's time. Here it was, in the month of April, that a rich banker was enticed, under pretext of a sale of shares, and assassinated by Laurent de Mille and Count Horn, that same Count Horn whose servant, passing himself off as master, played so infamous a trick upon poor Angelica Kaufmann, ancestress of Pauline in the drama of The Lady of Lyons. A little higher up in the Rue de Venise, and, leading likewise to the Rue Quincampoix, is the Passage Moliere, which owes its name to the Theatre Moliere, opened on the 4th of June, 1 79 1, with a representation of the Misanthrope. In 1703 it was re-baptised Theatre des Sans- Culottes. Its first director under its new name was Boursault-Malesherbes, comedian, member of the Convention, and farmer of public games. Closed and re-opened a score of times, this house became in the early years of Louis Philippe's reign a theatre for dramatic instruction, where Mile. Rachel received her first lessons from Saint- Aulaire. class directed by Saint-Aulaire. This profi a retired comedian who understood the acting better than he had ever practise had taken the Salle Moliere just spoken of; and here during the years 1834, '835, and Rachel was made to play a great variety ot parts, including nearly every leading character in the plays ot Corneille, Racine, and .Moliere. The charges for admission to the Salle Moliere were moderate, but the house was always full when Rachel had been announced to play, and the tickets on these occasions were sold at a premium. One day M. Vedl, treasurer ot the Francais, went to the Salle Moliere to see a soubrette whom his manager thought of en gaging. He was about to leave the tli when Saint-Aulaire begged him to remain in order to see a pupil who had not yet app, and of whom he entertained the greatest hi This, of course, was little Rachel, who was about to play the part of Hermione in Andromaque. She resembled none of the other pupils whom the emissary from the Theatre Francais had seen. She was small in stature and had a hard, almost a harsh voice ; which, howevei . firm and impressive, and, when the young girl became excited, almost musical. After the per formance, M. Vedl complimented the young actress, and promised to do his best lor her at the important theatre with which hi connected. He at once spoke of her to M. Jouslin de La Salle, director of the Francais, who, after seeing her in Tancrede, arrangi special performance, which was attended, in the character of judges, by M. Samson Mile. Mars. \"She is too short,\" objected one of the party. \" She will grow,\" replied Mile. Mars significantly ; and on the recommendation ofthe manager of the Theatre Francais sin admitted to the Conservatoire. Universally recognised as one of the greatest of French actresses, Rachel, of Jewish race, was born on the 28th of February, 182 1, at Munf, a Swiss village in the Canton 01 Argovia. Her father and mother were, however, both French ; the former, Jacques Felix, being a native ot Metz, the latter, Esther Hayn, of Guers, in the department of the Lower Rhine. In the year 1831, Rachel, under her true name of Elisa, was a street singer at Lyons, where Choron, director of an important musical academy, chanced to hear her. He was so struck by the beauty of her voice that he called upon Elisa's parents, and induced them to settle in Paris, where he- promised to take charge of their little daughter's musical education. He suggested that she should adopt in lieu of \" Elisa \" the more impressive name of Rachel. But before her studies had progressed very far she lost her Voice ; and Choron placed her in a dramatic Rachel entered the class directed by M.

The experiment, however, was not altogether satisfactory, and she returned to the place. In the fields of this church lie buried the philosopher Gassendi, and the historians Henri and Adrien de Valois, together with Malle de Scudery, who wrote the once rvatoire, and remained until , when, on the recom mendation of M. Samson, she was at the Theatre Franoais. Her first appearance' there, as Camille in Les Horaces, took place on the 1 2th of June in this same year. She was then but sixteen years old, and only moderately pretty. Short for her age, she had the further disadvantage of being marked with the small-pox. With narrow chin, high cheek-bones, and a forehead, she had brilliant, expressive- eyes, at once thoughtful and full of fire. The pose of her head wtis admirable, and all her gestures were marked by dignity and distinction. Calm and self-contained throughout greater part of the performance, she never abandoned herself to her emotion even while expressing the ardent passion, There was in tensity in all she did, and so novel, lividual was her style that she inspired her audience with the strongest id admiration.

That the exhibition of machines, as superin tended during the last days of the monarchy by M. Vaiidcrmond, was a sight worth seeing is shown by Arthur Young having gone to sec it when he was making, throughout France, that tour of inquiry which was destined to become- famous. \"I visited,\" he writes in 1789, just one month before the taking of the Bastille, \"the repository of royal machines, which M. Vandermond showed and explained to me- with great readiness and politeness. What struck me most was M. Yaucanson's machine for making a chain which, I was told, -Mr. Watt, of Birmingham, admired very much, at which my attendant- seemed not displeased. Another for making the cogs intended in iron wheels. There 1- a chaff-cutter from an English original ; and a model of the nonsensical plough to go without horses. These arc the only ones in agriculture.

In 1702 a commis sion had been appointed to \"catalogue and collect in suitable places books, instruments, and other objects of science and art in view of public instruction \" ; and a few months later in the same year the Convention published a new decree constituting the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers on a solid basis, and assigned to it the buildings of the former \" abbey of Saint-Martin.\" In front of the principal entrance to the Con servatoire a large square was made in l86oj its sides being formed by the Rue Saint-Martin, the Boulevard Sebastopol, the Rue Solon: Cans, and the Rue du Caire. On the south side of the square, in the Rue du Caire, is seen the facade of the Theatre de la Gaiete, which leu deserves its title than our own Gaiety Theatre in London. Originally known by the named Nicolet, its founder, and afterwards called, during the influence of Mine, du Barry, the Theatre of the King's Dancers, it at length received, towards the end of the last century, the inappropriate title which still belongs to it. There was a time, it must be presumed, when at the Gaiete gay pieces were performed. But since the beginning of the century thi- house has been chiefly associated with spectaculai melodramatic productions. Here the famous fairy piece, Le Pied de Mouton, was produced striking success in 1806. Some twenty J ago it was revived at the Porte Saint-Martin, where it ran nearly a year. Reconstructed in 1808, the Gaiete was burnt to the ground in 183?. No sooner had it bt built up again than it was pulled down to make way for the Boulevard du Prince Eugene. Gaiete, which now, as already mentioned, stands on the southern side of the square of the C servatoire des Arts et Metiers, 1- one of thefou theatres belonging to the Town of Pans. Here At present this Conservatoire is under the authority of the Minister of Commerce. Fifteen courses of lectures, public and gratuitous, are delivered within its walls on subjects connected with the application of art to manufactures ; and forthese, three amphitheatres, the largest of which can accommodate an audience of 750, have been provided. The ancient abbey of Saint-Martin is still represented by two edifices connected with the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, and containing the library of the institution. One of these- buildings was formerly the chapel, the other the refectory of the abbey. At the corner of the Rue Saint-Martin and the Rue tie Vertbois is an ancient tower in pepper-caster form, which once marked the junction of the fortified part of the abbey and its prison.

The greatest proof that can be given of the usefulness of this institution, and how iic-e-iltul it was in Paris, is the great con course ol people who daily resort there to raise temporary sums. It is said, but I will not vouch for the truth of the assertion, that in the space of a few months there were forty tuns filled with gold watches; this I rather take to be an ex- it ion, meant only to give an idea of the very great number that were then in the warehouse.

The church was built with an asylum joined to it, and it was open, not only to the pilgrims, but also lu seventy poor persons whom it received every day. The Abbey of Saint-Magloire date- from the tenth century, when it stood half-way mi the road from the Cite to Saint-Denis. It was converted by Marie de Medicis into a convent known a- that ofthe Filles-Dieu, where penitent girls found shelter. It was suppressed, like all the other religion- houses, in 1703. Some fifty years afterwards the foundations of the convent, which had fallen into ruin, were being dug up with a view to some new building, when ten Gothic statues were discovered, mutilated and blackened. Among the stone figures Saint James was easily recognised by his pilgrim's costume. The statues were claimed by the town, and now figure in the Musee des Thermes.

Dis. missed by the Bourbons in 1X14, he did his utmost towards bringing the dethroned Emperor from Elba, and, on the news of his arrival in France, took possession of the Post Office; in return for which Napoleon gave him the superior appointment of Minister of the Interior. -After the battle of Waterloo and the Second Restoration, Lavalette was an brought to trial on a charge of high treason, and condemned to death. His wife, however, Louise de Beauharnais, had sworn to save him, and with this view sought an audience of King Louis XVIII. She had many friends who wen willing to aid her in her wifely enterprise. The Duke dc Richelieu promised to speak to the Duchess of Angouleme in favour of Lavalette; and she, it was hoped, would intercede with the king.

The very poor find their profit in the superfluity of the very rich ; while the working classes profit by the relative cheapness of everything.

The corn market occupies a portion of the site ofthe- ancient Hotel dc Soissons, given to the convent of Penitent Girls by Louis XII., from whom Catherine de Medici- bought it in 1572 as a residence for herself. A curious and significant memorial of the queen mother'.- abode subsists in the shape of a column 30 metre- high (the French metre is somewhat longer than the English yard), which is said to have been erected for Ruggieri, chief astrologer to the- queen. At the base of the column is a fountain inscribed with the Arms of Paris ; at the summit a sun-dial, constructed by Canon Pingre. Two interesting buildings of different, and, indeed, opposite character-, that must not be forgotten in connection with the central markets are the new Commercial Exchange (in the Rue Etienne Marcel) and the old Fortress of John the Fearless, a very interesting specimen of the medi\u00e6val military architecture. The greater part of this ancient quarter has been pulled down, and in place of it has arisen a new General Post Office (Hotel tics Postes), a building which resembles at once a barrack, a prison, a market-place, and a stable. The de spatch, reception, and distribution of letters and printed papers is managed in the upper storeys, to which there are lifts, while the- ground floor is reserved for the- public.

It was not until nearly a year after the intro duction of post-cards in England that, on the proposition of Count Bismarck, only a few weeks before the war of [870, they were adopted in Germany, which may claim to be the first country that used post-cards, or, indeed, a regular postal service of any kind, in an enemy's country while hostilities were actually going on. The post-card was adopted by the French Chamber in 1872 on the recommendation of M. Widow ski, who had previously published an interesting pamphlet on the subject. After speaking ofthe great variety of purposes for which the post card is employed in England, the celebrated economist went on to consider whether the use of po=t-cards could have an injurious effect on epistolary style. He decided that by imposing brevity it lent itself to conciseness, and that, forced to express himself in narrow limits, the writer on a post-card was bound to be terse, if not epigrammatic. The style, however, of corre spondents making use of post-cards is probably not more lapidary than that of ordinary letter writers. According to M. Wolowski, the circu lation of post-cards in England amounted, in 1871, only a year or two after their first intro duction, to 75 millions \u2014 nearly a million and a half per week.

When he had put this motion he went on to propose the- idea of a machine, rapid in action, which would diminish the sufferings of capital offenders. Hi- motion was carried unanimously ; but the suggestion as to the machine was reserved for future dis cussion. It was during this debate that Dr. Guillotin, vehemently advocating the instru ment of death which hitherto existed only in his own mind, exclaimed, in an unguarded moment: \"With my machine I will cut your head off in a twinkling, and without your suffering a twinge.\" There was a general roar of laughter.

I '.. A- a matter of fact, the worthy doctor, a man already at this time famed for his philanthropy, did not invent, but only suggested, the guillo tine. By the expression, \"my machine,\" he simply meant such a machine as the authorities, if they profited by his vague idea, would cause to be constructed. He had proposed nothing more than the principle of decapitation, whilst indicating in general terms the various instru ments anciently employed for the purpose in dif ferent countries. Nevertheless, the whole nation was soon laughing at him, his exclamation being made the text of endless pleasantries. People were intensely amused at this notion of cutting off one's head in a twinkling from philanthropy. The instrument was christened long before it had been invented, and with the name of the unhappy doctor. A clever song was dashed oil at the time, telling how a certain M. Guillotin, doctor and politician, woke up one fine morning and discovered that the custom of hanging was unpatriotic ; how he immediately hit upon a method of punishment which, without rope or"], [362, "328 PARIS, OLD AND NEW. \" National RaMr. - -take, would be so effective as to throw the executioner out of employment ; and how the machine which the doctor indicated could bear no fitter name than the guillotine. should have his head cut off.

At length tie mittee of Legislation called upon the celebrated surgeon Louis to draw up a re] the subject, indicating the fittest methods for cutting nil a per son's head rapidly and according to the principle- ot science. The witty Sophie- Arnould, meeting once, as she walked through a wood, sonic physician of her acquaintance, with under his arm, inquired us him: \" Do you not find your pre scriptions sufficient ? \" seems droll enough thai. the mission of doct retically at least, to preserve life, a surgeon should havi selected by the Assembly to RUE DE LA VRILLIERE. prescribe the fastest method of taking it.

He set forth, in tl place, that cutting instruments are in nothing but saws of a more or less fine d -cription, having very little effect when tl strike- perpendicularly,' and that it wa quently necessary in execution It was this song, perhaps, which really fixed the name of the deadly weapon. So far, how ever, the Assembly, as we have seen, had come to no decision on the subject, having simply decreed the principle of equality in criminal punishments. The question of the mode of execution was entrusted for discussion to a special committee. On the 21st of September, 1791, after lengthy debate, the Assembly adopted the new penal code, of which one clause pro vided that every criminal sentenced to death"], [363, "THE GUILLOTINE dional Razor.' 329 them in an oblique and gliding fashion. Adopting, therefore, the idea propounded by Guillotin \u2014 whom he did not even name in the report\u2014 he maintained that decapitation, in order to be surely effected, must be the direct act not of -1 man, but of a machine, the adoption of which he now recommended. He mentioned a machine then employed in Eng land which was, in fact, a rude sort of guillotine, and suggested several improvements in con nection with it. Nor, indeed, was the notion of such an instrument by any means new. Some very old German prints exist representing exe cutions performed in a similar fashion.

It does not stain any man's hand with the murder of his fellow, and the promptitude with which it strikes the criminal is in the spirit of law, which may often be severe, but ought never to be cruel.\" The first political execution took place on the night of 21st August, ijqn.at ten o'clock, to the Hare of torches. The victim was Louis David Collenot d'Agremont, put to death for having been seen amongst the enemies of the people on the eventful day of the ioth August. This execution marked the commencement of an era of relentless and bloody feuds ; but it was not until the establishment of the revolutionary tribunal, on 7th April, 1 7 q 3 , that the guillotine in to ply its deadly blade in such fearful earnest. From that moment to the 28th July the total number of persons executed wtis 2,625. Ihe earliest political executions had for their scene the Place du Carrousel, whilst ordinary criminals continued to be decapitated on the Place dc Greve. On the ioth Mav, 1703, the Convention, sitting then at the Tuileries, just opposite the ugly guillotine, called upon the Executive Council to choose another site. The Commune selected the Place de la Revolution (Concorde), where the guillotine was in operation until the 1 2th June, [794. It was then erected in the Place du Trone. Some persons had suggested the Bastille ; but in the eves of the people this was a place which had acquired an almost sacred character. Under the Em pire and the Restoration the guillotine stood on the Place de Grfeve, and under Louis Philippe at the Barriere St. Jacques, whilst to-day it is transferred to the Place de la Roquette. During the Reign of Terror the French nation wa- so familiarised with the idea of violent death that executions did not produce the same feeling of horror as at ordinary times. And now the real character of the Frenchman began to rt itself. In the gaols it became a favourite diversion with the prisoners to \" play at the guillotine.\" People gave burlesque names to the horrible machine, such as \" national razor,\" etc. It is even said that ear-rings in the shape of miniature guillotines were now largely worn by fashionable ladies. Within their Paris mansions aristocrats were accustomed to kill the time by ins of a toy guillotine, which was placed on the table during dessert. Beneath this instru ment were passed in succession several puppets, Dr. Louis did not content himself with pre paring this report. He hired a German mechan ician, named Schmidt, to construct at his directions a machine which, after a succession of improvements, was definitely adopted. The first experiments were made at I'icctre, on ani mals\u2014which reminds one- inevitably of Mr. W. S.

THK EXECUTIONER. The Executioner\u2014 His Taxes and Privilege, rs \u2014 Monsieur de Paris \u2014 Victor of Nimes. THE executioner is one of the most curious, interesting, and important figures in the history of France- in general and of Paris in particular. Going back to the thirteenth century, we find that there already existed an individual whose duty it was to whip, hang, behead, break mi the wheel, and burn in the name of the law He was then called the Executioner ot High Justiic, and every bailiwick possessed such a functionary. An ordinance of 1204 against blasphemers provides that ''anyone who has offended by word or deed shall he- beaten, naked, with rods ; that is to say, men by a man, and women by a woman, without the presence of any man.\" Hence some historians have interred that the office of bourrelle, or female executioner, existed. This is an error ; though it is quite true that the wife or the daughter of the boitrreau was usually preferred for the duty of whipping female misdemeanants. As to the rest, an elab orate apprenticeship had to be gone through by the executioner before be was deemed fit tor his work, the law stipulating that he must be com petent to whip, quarter, break mi the wheel, fork, clip off ears, gibbet, dismember, and so forth. For a long time the executioner wore a special costume \u2014 a cassock wrought in the colours peculiar to the town in which he operated, and bearing in front the representation of a gibbet, and, behind, that of the scaffold staircase \u2014 emblems somewhat too obvious of his infamous profession. So soon as the office of boitrreau was permanently established, large taxes were enfeoffed to him, and the executioner- of France now became so jealous of their prerogatives that one of them in 1560 sued a gentleman at law because, seizing a thief who tried to take his purse, he had drawn his sword and cut off the rascal's ear. In thus acting the gentleman m accused of having infringed on the execution! 1 rights and invaded his profession, the ear technically belonging to the executioner .1 of his perquisites. No less curious than mani fold were the taxes and privileges of all kinds enjoyed by this functionary.

The heads, moreover, of any pigs found straying in the streets or highways of Paris belonged tu the executioner.

It was not only upon the persons of criminals that the executioner had to operate. He was sometimes required to burn or behead dummies representing offenders who had eluded capture. Peter the Cruel, King of Castile, having killed mie of his subjects, was condemned to death. But as the person of the king was sacred, he wa- only executed in effigy, the hour r can be heading with his sword an image intended to represent him. The public executioner has generally been more loathed in France than even in England. And justly so ; for in the former country his work for many centuries has been peculiarly infamous, not to say diabolical. In the present day, it is true, ''Monsieur de Paris\" simply touches a button and his victim, without a struggle or a pang, is no more. But he was not always so humane. Once it was his own hand that dealt slow death and inflicted fiendish torture. It was he who quartered the con demned wretch \u2014 who attached horses, that is to say, to his legs and arms, and then drove them in four different directions. It was he who burned or broke on the wheel \u2014 the latter an indescribably ghastly operation, in which he .111 iron bar to break almost every bone in the victim's body.

It was even proposed to confer upon him, as executioner, a new and finer title \u2014 that of \"National Avenger\"; and M. Matton de la Wireline was quite eloquent in his praise. \" What would become of society ? \" he said ; \" of what use would be the judges, of what avail authority, if an active and legitimate force did not exist to avenge outrage- committed upon citizens whom it is the care of the law to pro tect ?

Ultimately he figured as an autobiographer. The last of the Sansons wrote his own memoirs, together with those of his ancestors, executioners like himself. By no means the- least curious fact in the history of the bourreau is that, in former days, he killed with one hand and healed with the other. He was a physician, that is to say; and at his dispensary, in the intervals between his murderous operations, he dealt out medicines to poor people who flocked to him for advice. By far the most famous of these medical boitrreaux was Victor of Ninics.

The great musical academy had its origin in a school of singing and declamation established in 1784 in order to prepare singers for the Opera. Tt . this institution was added in 1786 a school of dramatic declamation, which had the honour of producing Talma. But the Conservatory of Music, as it now exists, owes its organisation to the Revolution. Founded in virtue of a decree dated August 3rd, 1795, it had for its first director the illustrious Cherubini, who was replaced by Auber, to whom has succeeded M. Ambroise Thomas, the composer of Mignon and of Hamlet. The students are admitted by competition, and the teaching is gratuitous. Prizes are adjudged every year, and of these the most important is the so-called Prix dc Rome, which enables its holder to study for a certain number of years in the great Italian city.

As, however, he goes away in a dejected mood, he is seen to pick up a pin ; and thi indication of order and economy ha- such an effect upon the banker that he is called back and at once appointed to a supplementary chair. It is said that a friend of Laffitte's, also out of employment, hearing ofthe success of this \"pin trick,\" as he termed it, resolved to try it himself. At the next office where he applied tor a situation his conversation and general demeanour so pleased the principal that he was all but engaged, when, in order to determine- the matter, he went through the gesture of picking up a pin-which he had held all the time between his fingers. \"What was that ? \" asked the head of the firm. \"A pin,\" was the"], [371, "THE RUE LAFFITTE.

Laffitte, however, while complimenting him on his punctuality, declared himself unable to receive such a contemptibly small sum, and told his debtor to keep it for another year, when he must bring him 500. On the officer's return, at the expiration of another twelvemonth, with the increased amount, Laffitte exclaimed ; \" Yes ; I sec you are a man of . , Keep the money and take back your Mini.\" It is so be hoped that Heine, in Paris at the time, heard this story, Ji be did not profit by its teaching ; for ,,l hi- amusing if cynical maxims, man had more chance \"I getting a loan poor friend, anxious to appear better off than he really was, than from a rich one whose ii ui was above questii m engaged as clerk ; and after his marriage he quickly became known by his enterprise, honesty, and tact to the great financial houses of Frank- fort, Mayence, and Darmstadt, who often en- trusted him with important commissions. Mayer Rothschild was forty-six years of age when the French Revolution broke out ; and it was in the midst of the trouble- caused by this great convulsion that he found his first great oppor- tunity of enriching himself. Immediately after the Reign of Terror, when, in 1704, the French armies were replying to the German invasion by themselves invading Germany, the smaller German princes became panic-stricken, and fled with such haste towards the Elbe that some of I them had not time to carry away all their gold. Among the illustrious fugitives wa- the- Elector oi Hes.-e-Cassel, who possessed more ready money than all his brethren of the Germ an Federation united. Finding it imprudent, if not impossible, to take with him in his travelling- carriage heaps of silver and gold, he resolved to place a portion of his treasure in the hands of trustworthy persons, and one of those selected was Mayer Rothschild of Frankfort. Two millions of florins were confided to him mi the simple understanding that he should restore the money at the conclusion of peace. The war, however, lasted for years ; and during this period the talents confided to the Hebrew banker were not allowed to lie buried in a napkin. He put them out at interest, made loans to the Governments and to the military commanders and commis-arics on all sides ; speculated, in short, with the money carefully and judiciously, without permitting himself to be influenced by any of the prejudices of patriotism. Ubi bene, ihi patria, was the motto of the Hebrew at the beginning of the century, and naturally enough ; for in a privileged society he was without privileges and almost without rights. Every career was I t<> him except those of medicine and money - making ; and in making money it was enough for the Hebrew to make it lawfully. There is no record of Mayer Roth- schild's having lent anything to the French Republic, which had liberated the Jews from every burden, every disability, weighing upon them in other countries. But he made advances to Napoleon and also, with fine impartiality, to England, Napoleon's most consistent foe. Any prince, more-over, reigning or deposed, could, if In possessed the requisite security, count upon the Frankfort financier for pecuniary aid. After tbe Revolution of 1830 Laffitte was :, ; Minister of Finance and President of the Council. This just man could not, however, pleasing either of the sections into which the Chamber was divided. His own party thought him too lukewarm, too un- e, while the Legitimists could not alliance with the party of Revolu tion. The Hue Laffitte may well be regarded as the headq finance, for, in addition to the banking-house id Laffitte, the French branch of the Rothschilds has here for more than half turybeen domiciled. The Rothschilds of like those of London, Frankfort, Vienna, and Naples, are descendants of the Mayer- Rothschilds who founded the first of the - hild banking-houses at Frankfort a cen tury ago.

After founding the branch bank of Vienna he directed, in concert with his brother Anselm' most ofthe great financial operations undertaken in Germany. He was an intimate friend ot Prince Metternich's, and his son, Baron Anselm mon, became, less from political tastes than m virtue of his rank, a member of the Au Reichsrath. War had broken out again, and Napoleon had undertaken that campaign against Russia which was to bring him to ruin, when Mayer Rothschild died, like a patriarch, surrounded by his ten children. He had never quitted his house in the Judc-n-gasse, and, millionaire as he now was, had never abandoned the long, characteristic frock coat of the Frankfort Jews. After quitting Vienna, Baron Solomon, the father, went to Paris, where, in association with his brother James, he undertook the management of the French bank. His son, the before-men tioned Baron Anselm Solomon, died at Vienna in 1874, leaving behind him one ofthe t galleries in the world. He had threi Nathaniel, Ferdinand, and Albert, the last-named of whom took the direction ot the Vienna bank. Of the ten children surrounding the bed ot the dying financier, five were sons \u2014 Anselm, Solomon, Nathan, Charles, and James. In giving them his last blessing he exhorted them to live together in the most perfect harmony : a com mand which was to be religiously obeyed. The five brothers formed in common an immense banking house, with the central establishment at Frankfort, and four branches at Vienna, London, Naples, and Paris. To undertake no important operation with.' -ut the consent of all the partners, to be content with a relatively small profit, to leave nothing to chance, to be always punctual and exact \u2014 such were the principles by which they were to be guided ; and in formally adopt ing them they took this motto : Concordta, I/idustria, Integritas. Baron Nathan de Rothschild, brother of the preceding, was born at Frankfort in 1; died there in 1836. His father, the founder of the family, had sent him as early as [798 to England, where, after passing some j Manchester, he established himself in Loud,, 11 111 1 Soo. After the death of his father he remained at the head ofthe London house, and pl considerable part in the great financial operations undertaken by the five brothers in common. In [813 he lent large sums to the English G nient, as well as to England's allies, and, after the peace, was, like his four brothers, appointed consul-general for Austria, and en Nathan, who, by the way, never made use of lus title, died at Frankfort in 1836, and was - in the direction of the London house b; Lionel de Rothschild. Baron Charles de Roth schild, the fourth of the five brothers, was Frankfort in 17.SK, and died at Naples il He directed the Naples bank from its fir lishment until his death. He reconstructed the finances of \"iedmont and Tuscany, and, in association with his brothers, borrowed Roman Government between 1831 and i8jl some 200,000,000 francs.

It was applied to for loans, first by the co alition of Powers marching against France, and, after Napoleon's final defeat, by the new mon archical Government of France, in view of the war indemnity. From this moment the house of Rothschild assumed colossal proportions. It seemed to hold Europe at every point, and no important financial operation could be un dertaken without its consent and aid. The Emperor of Austria ennobled the brothers Roth schild in 1815, at the time of the Vienna Confer ences, and in 1822 created them barons and appointed them consuls-general for Austria in the different cities where they were estab lished. Of Mayer Rothschild's five sons, Baron Anselm, the eldest, born at Frankfort in 1773, assumed, after the death of his father, the direction of the Frankfort bank, and while remaining at its head took an active part in founding the four branch houses at Paris, London, Vienna, and Naples.

He rendered important financial aid French Government under the reign of Louis Philippe, and during the Second Empire. It was Baron James de Rothschild, moreover, who furnished the brothers Pereire with the sums necessary for the construction of the first railways in France. for instance, Naples, and Turin, where some of the finest palaces and mansions were his. 'Lo the end of his life the great financier displayed a most prodigious activity. He was quick, hot-tempered, peevish, and surly to approach. But if he has been often reproached with brutality to under lings, he, on the other hand, treated the great with none too much ceremony. One day the Count de Morny entered the baron's office at a moment when he was busily engaged. \" Take a chair,\" said the financier, without looking at him. \"Pardon me,\" said the injured visitor; \" you cannot have heard my name. I am the Count de Morny.\" \"Take two chairs,\" replied Baron James, wdthout lifting his eyes off the papers before him. This prince of millionaires never carried more than fifty francs in his pocket ; and he himself declared that by means of this aid to economy he had saved half a million francs in tlie course of his life. At the club of the Rue Royale, where he was accustomed to play whist after dinner, much amusement was caused by the extraordinary purse he always carried. It was fitted with a lock, and the key to this lock hung as a pendant to the baron's watch chain. To pay a debt of ten sous he had first to get hold of the key and then open the lock ; nor even when he had done so was there always enough in the purse to discharge his liability. At his club he was called simply \" The Baron \" \u2014 his compeers were all barons of something or other ; and for this title he had always a punctilious regard. He was a great lover of art, and had formed a magnificent collection in the chateau at Ferric-res. By his marriage with his niece, daughter of Baron Solomon de Rothschild, he left four sons \u2014 Edmond, Gustave, Alphonse, and Nathaniel, of whom the first-named became na turalised in France, and assumed on his father's death the direction of the Paris house. During the siege ofthe capital in January, 1 87 1, he, in association with his brothers, expended 300,000 francs on the relief of the necessitous ; and in 1872 subscribed for a sum of 2,750,000,000 francs towards the loan required to buy the foe out of the country. Falsely accused of having speculated in corn during the dearth of 1S47, he had reason to fear, at least for a time, after the Revolution ; 3, that he could no longer live safely at Paris. His house was pillaged and burnt, and he was indeed on the point of quitting France, when the Prefect of Police, Caussidicre, persuaded him . , and placed at his disposal a picket of the Republican Hoard, which was stationed in the yard of his mansion night and day. The baron gave 50,000 francs towards the relief ofthe wounded of February, illuminated his house to that he was not hostile to Republican in stitutions, and tranquilly continued his operations bank. When Caussidiere, obliged to leave France, decided to set up as a wine merchant in 11, I<ar. ui James, mindful of the service hi had rendered him, did not, it is true, offer him a moni y, which might have been refused, but in the handsomest manner ordered such large annual consignments of wine from him, that Caussidiere could thenceforth have lived rtably without selling a drop of his stuff to oner. The baron never boasted m, but the wine merchant took delight in telling the story of his patron's dedicate grati tude. Thanks to his state loans, to his banking \u2022change transactions, and to the great com- d enterprises which he had created or pro- I, the financier had amassed enormous wealth.

The Barrifere Clichy has given its name to one of the mosl characteristic of Horace Vernet's works\u2014 the picture of this barrier as seen in 1814 during the advance upon Paris of the allied armies. The prison of Clichy, familiarly known as \"Clichy,\" in the street of the same name, was the Paris prison for debt. Here, until the Second Empire, debtors were confined under conditions peculiar to France, or at least 111 known in England. The duration of the imprisonment was determined by the magnitudi of the debt, up to a period of five years; thi maximum term, whatever amount mi\u00bbht he owed. The debtor was maintained at the cost of the creditor, who had to deposit a sum ol forty-five francs with the prison officials before his victim could be admitted within the pt walls. From early morning until ten o'clock at night the prisoners were free to walk about the grounds and occupy themselvi they thought fit. There were two hundred rooms for men, and sixteen for women; and, contrary to the general opinion on the subject, largely due to humorous writers andcaricatui the prisoners belonged, for the most part, not to the aristocratic class, but to the class of small tradesmen. As the enforced allow ance hum the creditor was only sufficient to provide the necessaries of life, a fund was maintained among the prisoners for supplementing the ordi bill of tare. There was a restaurant for pri\u00bb of means, and light wines were on sale, to thi exclusion of dessert wines and liqueurs. If often happened, the creditor omitted to p the support of the debtor, the lattffl free.

It dates back to the earliest age- ot Christianity. Destroyed by the Romans, it was completely rebuilt in 1137. Partly burnt in 155,1, it was half demolished in 1792, and restored without any regard to regularity or unity of design. It thus presents, at first sight, the aspect of a ruin held together by means ot shaky scaffolding-. The Butte Montmartre is an enormous mass ot gypsum, about 125 metres high, and it has furnished century after century the finest kind of plaster, required for the construction of build ings 111 Paris. As a consequence it has been dangerously hollowed mit, and in recent times a part of the hill gave way and precipitated itself upon the district below.

At the bottom of the Rue Lepic a vast en closure is visible full of trees of various kinds, with the cypress prominent amongst them.

Guychabot, a distinguished member ,,| the court of Francis I., and afterwards of Henry II., had taken an important part in the war of Italy. But he is chiefly remembered bv his duel with La Chateigneraie, arising from the rival influences at court of the Duchess of F.tampes and Diana of Poitiers. An offensive statement about him having been made, or rather repeated, by the Dauphin, he replied by charging its author, whoever he might be, with mendacity. La Cha teigneraie. asjarnae may or maynot have known, was the originator of the calumny, for which, indeed, he accepted full responsibility. Francis I., now in his old age, would not permit the ad versaries to light ; and it was not until Henry II. came to the throne that the duel took place, mi the plain of Saint-Germain, with all the pomp and ceremony of the ancient judicial duels, and in presence of the whole court. Jarnac, weaker and less skilful than his enemy, who was one of the first duellists of the age, had taken lessons of an Italian bravo ; and he dealt La Chateigneraie a violent and unexpected thrust in the leg (after wards to be known as le coup dc Jarnac). La Chateigneraie perished in the duel, and Henry II. swore on his corpse never to permit another. He endeavoured to keep his word ; but his authorisation was dispensed with, and duelling became one ofthe fashions of the day. In 1560 the States-General of the Kingdom, assembled at Orleans, begged Charles IX. to punish without remission all duellists ; and the Tiers Etat having formulated the same request, a royal order was published, which served as basis to the edicts on this subject published by Henry IV. and Louis XIY. In these documents duelling was placed in the category of capital offences; which had no effect but to increase the number of duels. Among the remarkable duels of this period must be men tioned one which was fought in the island of the City, between two gentlemen, who, finding themselves pursued by the police in an approach ing boat, fought with such a determination to get the affair quickly to an end, that four sabre strokes sufficed to lay both dead. 'she court ,d honour might or might not be the preliminary to the Conge de la Bataille. When the latter was granted the fact was an nounced by the king's herald. 'Lhe duel might Min grounds be declined, and an example ut this is cited, in which Count William of Fur stenberg refused to meet a certain Sieur de Yasse count of his inferior birth. Victor Hugo reproduced this spirit of aristocratic punctilio, which did not spring from personal me, in his drama of Marion me. Didier, the hero, of obscure birth, challenges a distinguished nobleman, who asks il name. \" Didier,\" is the reply. \"Didier tic quoi ? \" inquires the noble man. \"Didier dc rien ! \" answers the bearer of the homely name, who declares that he knew his father ; whereupon the aristo- ig him the benefit of the doubt, '\u2022 it bo may possibly be of the highest I it oim consents to cut throats with him.

Bussy having been wounded, Saint-Phal retired, but only to be summoned ifterwards to a new combat. The Captain of the King's Guard, sent to interdict the fight, made no impression upon Bussy, who tried to pick a quarrel with him, and declared that he would appeal to the King aud ask permission to meet his foe in the li-t-. character since i6ai. He had already crossed swords with the Count dc Pont-Gibaut, the Marquis de Portes, and the Count de Thorigny, to mention no other names ; and in 1627 he took upon himself, in defiance ofthe law, to fight the Baron de la Frette and the Marquis de Beuvron. This last duel was fatal to him. He had been foolhardy enough to draw swords with the mar quis on the Place Royale and in broad daylight. The marquis fled to England, but Bouteville found his way to the scaffold. Before his execution, Richelieu had said to Louis XIII. : From 1 -'is t\" v>o* ilucl- caused more victims die- civil wars. It has been calculated that 0 this period nearly eight thousand gentle men perished in single combat. Henry IY. himself followed the fashion ; but unable from his position to fight in person, he fought by ration. In presence ot the Duke tie Guise he bad shown some jealousy in regard to Bassom pierre, who had been much struck by Mile. d'Antraigues. The duke offered to avenge the monarch, and his proposition being a duel took place. Bassompierre re- t a lance wound from which he with diffi culty recovered. But soon afterwards Henry IV. himself obliged to issue an order against duelling, which was little more than a reproduc tion ol the .me put birth by hi- predecessor.

But 1 markable infraction was that which \"It isa question of cutting the throat, either of these duels or of your Majesty's edicts.\" The exemplary punishment inflicted upon Bouteville did not, however, by any means exterminate duelling. Even ecclesiastics at this period went through a course of training at the fencing acad emics. Men of letters frequently laid down the pen for the sword. To know how to administer cold steel became the height of ambition with fashionable Parisians. The most desperate duel list of the time Was Cyrano de Bergerac, who would challenge mi the spot anyone who looked at him, or anyone who did not look at him. The contagion of the duel spread even to the gentler sex. Two b. lies of the court fought at Paris with pistols. 'Lhe King, when he heard of it, smiled and said that his prohibition had only been aimed at men. The troubles of the Fronde still further increased the number 1 if swi ird-drawing swaggerers in Paris. One duel which occurred during the civil feuds that disturbed the earlier years of Louis XIY.'s reign, caused an extraordinary sensation. It had its origin in a letter supposed to have dropped from the pocket of the Count de Coligny, one of the tenants of Mme. de Longueville. The missive was com promising to the lady-writer, whoever she might be ; and, in connection therewith, the Duchess de Montbazon spread certain scandalous rumours, for which .Mine, de Longueville demanded, and obtained, an apology. But with this repara tion the offended lady was not content. She urged Coligny to challenge one of the favourites ot Montbazon, the Duke oi Guise, to fight him. The duel took place on the Place Royale at three o'clock mi the 12th of December, 1043. (iuisc, as he grasped the hilt of hi- sword, said to Coligny: \u2014 \"We arc going to decide the ancient quarrels of our two houses, and we shall soon sec the difference there is between the blood of Guise and the blood of Coligny.\" Thereupon the adversaries fell to their work.

He tired, and shot Neraours dead with three balls that were in the pistol.\" Under Louis XIY. no less than twelve edict! were issued against duelling, (hie of tli, published in 1704, promised lawful for outraged honour. To give the lie, to strike with the hand or with a stick, were ol punishable with imprisonment. Anyone who had received a box on the car- was entitled to return it. But the royal commands remained without effect. Among the great duclli Louis XIY.'s reign must be mentioned the Duk, de Richelieu, who did as much to pro duelling as the famous cardinal of the name had done in the previous reign to prevent it. He not only fought duels himself, Im: the cause of duels on the part of others ; and of ladies above all. In his various encountei severely wounded the Duke de Bourbon, ran Prince de Lixen through the body, and killed Baron Pontereider. The two ladies who fought at his instigation were Mme. de Nesll Mme. de Polignac. \" Take the first shot,\" the last-named antagonist. Mine, de Xesle fired and missed. \"Anger makes the hand tremble,\" observed Mme. de Polignac, with ,1 malicious smile. Taking aim in her turn. cut off the tip of her adversary's ear; where upon poor Mme. de Ncsle fell to the ground a> il mortally wounded. making a gigantic thrust, slipped and fell on his knee. Guise hastened t<> put his foot on his shoulder, and said : \" I do not wish to kill you - I simply treat you as you deserve tor having dared to challenge a member of my house without cause.\" Then he struck the count with the flat of his sword. Coligny threw himself back ward- and di-engaged his weapon, whereupon the fight recommenced. Guise, however, ter minated it bv means of a tremendous blow which he dealt his adversary on the arm. At the same moment fell both of the seconds\u2014 d'Estrades and Bridie -ux\u2014 who had run each other through. This was the last of the famous duels fought on the Place Royale. Mme de Longueville had witnessed it, concealed behind a window ofthe Hotel de Rohan. Nine years later took place the celebrated and sanguinary duel between the Duke de Nemours and the Duke de Beaufort. They quarrelled at Orleans, where Nemours had cried out, in presence of Beaufort, \"The prince is being deceived, and 1 know by whom!\" \"Name him,\" said Beaufort. \"You, yourself!\" an swered Nemours. Beaufort's reply was a box on the- ear, instantly returned by Nemours ; and they would at once have crossed swords had not Mile, dc Montpensier been present. On the day fixed for the duel, in the Faubourg Saint- Antoine, the two brothers-in-law seemed to have become reconciled. But some question of pre- e revived the bad feeling between them. \"M. de Beaufort,\" relates the Duchess de Montpensier, \" did all he could to avoid the meeting. He set forth, among other reasons, that he had a number of gentlemen with him ready to take part in the duel, while his antago nist had only a few. Monsieur de Nemours returned to his house, where he found awaiting him just as many gentlemen as were required. He went back to M. dc Beaufort, and they fought in the horse market, at the back of the Hotel de Ycndoiiie. M. de Nemours had with him Villiers, the Chevalier de La Chaise, Campan, and Luzerche. M. de Beaufort had the Count de Bury, de Ris, Brillct, and Hericourt. The Count de Bury was severely wounded. Dc Ris and Hericmirt died in the course of the day. None of the others were wounded, except very slightly. M. de Nemours had brought with him swords and pistols. The latter had been loaded at his house. M. dc Beaufort said to his adversary : ' Brother, what a shame ! Let us forget and be friends.' M. de Nemours cried out to him : ' No, scoundrel ! you must kill me or Two years before the outbreak of the Revolu tion a sub-lieutenant of the Fourth Hu chosen by his comrades to avenge an insult offered to the regiment by a fencing-master.

'Lhe Chamber of Deputies in 1819, and the Chamber of Peers in the year following, debated the question of definitive legislation on the subject of duelling ; but their deliberations came to nothing. Shortly afterwards literature con tributed another victim to the insatiable Moloch of \" honour,\" in the person of a highly talented poet named Dovalle. He had attacked, in some journal, a theatrical director ; and the offensive article cost him his life. At the time when the Duchess de Berry was under arrest the editor ofthe Legitimist journal, the Revenant, called at the office of the Tribune to demand satisfaction b ir an article directed against the duchess. The immediate result was a second article in the Tribune defying the advocates of the fail prisoner ; and so strong a spirit 01 partisanship was now excited on either side that students from the schools rushed in crowds to enroll their names at the offices of the antagonistic journals. Two small armies having thus been raised, a letter, signed by Godefroi Cavaignac, Armand, Marrast, and Garderin, was addressed to the Revenant in these terms: \u2014 \"We send you a first list of twelve persons. We demand, not twelve simultaneous duels, but twelve successive duels \u2014 time and place as may be conveniently arranged. No excuses, no pretexts, no cowardly evasion ; this would avail you nothing, and of this you would have to bear the consequences. Henceforth, between your party and ours, there is a drawn sword. There will be no truce, except when one yields to the other.\" The Legitimist party did not choose to accept the challenge in so generalised a form. It entrusted its cause to the hands of M. Roux-Laboric, who fought a duel with Armand Carrel, the appointed champion of the opposite side. Carrel received an almost fatal wound in the stomach ; nor was this the last combat which the arre-t of the Duchess de Berry occasioned. Tragedy and comedy were often intermingled in the duelling of the period. There was one well-know 11 rerer, an ex-body-guard named Choquart, ub.. was -o enormously vain ofthe reputation he had gained for drawing his sword that, when once a pedestrian had, accidentally, with his Charles Lameth, Mirabeau, and Camille oulins likewise fought duels. Camille oulins had the courage, however, to refuse ttle by arms quarrels of a political kind. \"I should have,\" he said on one occasion, \"to my life in the Bois de Boulogne if I were ed to give satisfaction to all who took offence at the frankness of my speech.

It is certain that no one afterwards regretted his death so keenly as the man whose bullet had pierced him ; and when, on the second of May, 1848, a concourse of workmen, national guards, and students from the sleeping democrat. In this speech he expressed a hope that the provisional government would crown the splendid work which Carrel had done by abolishing the duel-that appeal to arms to which he so keenly regretted ever bin had recourse. Since then there have been repeated agitations in favour of this abolition, but without result. Duels in France, though seldom serious nowadays, are still frequently and with comparative impunity.

A duel was arranged ; when the combatants arrived mi the ground it was raining in torrents ; Sainte-Beuve had conic provided with an umbrella and with flint pistols of the sixteenth century. At the moment when the adversaries were to pull their triggers Sainte-Beuve was still carefully shielding himself from the elements with his umbrella. The seconds protested, but Sainte-Beuve refused to get wet. \"I don't mind being killed,\" he exclaimed ; \" but I decline to catch cold.\" The duel then proceeded, Sainte-Beuve levelling his pistol with one hand and holding up his umbrella with the other. Four shots were exchanged, but without injury qn either side. Cyrano de Bergerac, of whom mention has already been made, was the most ferocious duellist of his time. His nose, of inordinate length, had received such a number of dents that it was quite a curiosity. He was very touchy on this subject, and would allow no one to look at him pointedly. .More than ten men expiated with their lives some satirical glance at him, or some ill-sounding word uttered in his presence. A certain bravo challenged an apothecary, by whom he conceived himself insulted. The duel was arranged, and the adversaries duly met, each accompanied by two seconds. One of the seconds of the aggrieved man held out a pair of swords, and the other a brace of pistols. \"Sir,\" cried the bravo, \"choose weapons. Pistol and sword are the same thing to me.\" \" That is all very well,\" replied the apothecary, \" but I do not see why you should impose your arms upon me ; I think I have as much right, and more, to impose mine on you.\" \"Good. What are your arms?\" was the reply. The apothecary took a little box from his pocket, opened it, and presented it to his adversary. \" There are two pills,\" he said : \" one is poisoned and the other harmless. Choose ! \" The affair ended in laughter. The Marquis de Rivarolles, who had just lost one of his legs in battle, uttered certain words offensive to Madillan, Schomberg's aide-de-camp. He was challenged. The marquis appointed his m to act as second. The surgeon promptly waited upon Madillan, but introduced himself without mentioning either his profession or the reply he was authorised to give. He simply displayed his case of surgical instruments. Madillan, mystified, inquired whether the visitor was the representative of de Rivarolles."], [390, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW. 354 \"I am,\" he said. \"M. de Rivarolles is quite ready to fight you, according to your desire; but, convinced that a man a- brave and generous a- yourself would not like to fight at a dispro portionate advantage, he has ordered me to take one of your legs off beforehand, st, that the chances between you will be equal.\" Madillan was enraged at this extraordinary proposition ; but the duel was, in the end, prevented by- Marshal de Schomberg, who succeeded in recon ciling the adversaries day. \" Why should he not ? be is my best friend \" was the reply. \" That i- scarcely what the public say.

Then he inquired the meaning of the whole affair. \"The public declare,\" said La Fontaine, \"that you l every day t< > my house to see, not me, hut my wife.\" \" My dear friend,\" returned Poignant, \"I should never have suspected you of such a misgiving, and I promise henceforth never to set foot across your threshold.\" \"(,'i the contrary,\" said La Fontaine, shaking the captain by the hand, \"I have done what the public wanted, and I now wish you to continue your visits to my house with more regularity than ever.\" Voltaire had recourse to a custom which he had himself energetically condemned. Dining one day at the Duke de Sully's, he happened, in the course of a discussion, to raise his voice a little. \"Who is that young man contradicting me so loudly ? \" asked the Chevalier de Rohan-Chabot. \" He is a man,\" replied Voltaire, \"who docs not b. last a great name, but who honours the name he bears.\" The chevalier did not reply, but a iew days afterwards he caused Voltaire to be waylaid and beaten by half a dozen ruffians. After having vainly tried to persuade the Duke de Sully to espouse his cause, Voltaire deter mined to trust solely to hi- own personal courage. He took fencing-lessons, and as soon as he was able to handle a .-word, waited upon the chevalier in his box' at the Theatre Francais. \" Sir,\" he said, \" unless some business affair ba- caused you to forget the insult which I suffered at your hands, I hope you will afford me- satisfaction.\" This was one of those arrows, barbed with irony, which Yoltaire knew so well how to throw. \"Some business affair\" was a phra-e which the chevalier could not decently bear. He accepted the challenge, but without intending to fight. Instead of crossing swords with the young poet he caused him to be thrown into the Bastille for having presumed to call out so great a personage. That most amiable of men, La Fontaine, once persuaded himself, or rather allowed himself to be persuaded, that he ought to be jealous of his wife. The circumstances were these. He was on terms of close friendship with an old captain of dragoons, retired from service, named Poig nant ; a gentleman distinguished bv candour and good nature. So much time as Poignant did not spend at the tavern he passed at the house of La Fontaine, and often in the society of his wife when the poet happened not to be at home. ( hie day someone asked La Fontaine how it was that he permitted Poignant to visit him every Let us conclude with an anecdote con. another duel which the \"public\" would have liked to see fought, but which never i pass, because the- aggrieved party had weakness for keeping lead and steed mil of 1 body.

The truth, doubtless, is that then, as now, some students were serious, and others abandoned to idleness and folly. As early as the thirteenth century student-riots became so frequent in Paris that, the church in this matter supporting the State, all scholars were forbidden to carry arms under pain of excommunication. During the Carnival of 1220, a band of students, after having eaten and drunk at a tavern in the suburb of Saint-Marcel, then outside the walls, provoked a quarrel at the moment of paying, and beat the tavern-keeper and his wife. The neighbours put the aggressors to flight. Next day the students returned in great force, broke into the house, smashed up the furniture, set the wine- running, and wounded several persons. The Provost of Paris hastened to the scene with his archers, and meeting a group of peaceable students who were innocent of the affair, swooped down upon them. Two were killed. The masters demanded reparation, but to no purpose. Then the schools were suspended, and Paris was deserted both by professors and students, who went to Rheims, Toulouse, Montpelier, already celebrated for its faculty of medicine, Orleans, and other towns, where the foundations of other universities were laid. The Paris Cniversity remained closed for two years. After the reopening of the schools new subjects of quarrel between the students and the townspeople, and between the students and the authorities, con- stantly arose. The right of fishing in one ofthe arms of the Seine was claimed by the students, or at least exercised by them until fines were imposed, which in most cases had to be re- covered by legal process. The foreign students, ver, who from the earliest times until now have always been admitted to the Paris schools on the most favourable terms, had disputes of their own ; seldom with the other members of the university, but very often with the citizens and the officials."], [392, ",t 356 PARIS, OLD AND NEW I 1 he - As we leave the Middle Ages we find that the Pan- student-, whilst losing a good deal ed their original character, preserve all their tur bulence and want of discipline.

From the ranks of the Paris students in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries stepped forth artists and writers who have remained the glory of France. the citizens. Nevertheless the Republican senti ment was by no means extinguished within them, nor did it fail to find expression amid those events which were the development of the vast revolu tionary tradition. The defence of Paris against the foreign invasion, in i,S 14, offered the students of the various schools, with those of the Polytechnic as leaders, an opportunity of proving their pat riotism. In presence of the peril into which the insatiable ambition of Napoleon had thrown the nation, the Polytechnic students, with those of law and medicine, made up twelve batteries of artillery for the National Guard. The pupils of the veterinary school of Alfort particularly distinguished themselves by their splendid defence of Charenton. These, how ever, were but isolated examples. \"History,\" writes Louis Blanc, \"which soars high above the lies of party, will tell us that in 1814 Paris did not care to protect itself; that the National Guard, with the exception of a few true men, A great number of students were initiated freemasonry and the other secret fraternities which ! the Revolution.

Is it not the same fir, courage which you demand when you summon such youths to defend the country ? Cease, thi n, to impute to them those disorders of which ih, \\ have been the victim.\" Foy and Benjamin Constant spoke in the same strain. But the Commission of Public Instruction passed a measure which excluded from the schools thirteen students of law and medicine ; andoneol these, Robert Lailavoix, suffered an imprison ment of two months. The indignation thu excited amongst the scholars of Paris found an echo in the provinces. Not long after some six hundred students were secretly foi into a military corps styled the Free Compai the Schools. For two months they instructed in the use of arms. The student-. bow ever, were Republican, whilst their li were Bonapartist ; and the latter, seized last moment with a fit of discretion, refus act. Otherwise the fiery youths who looked to them for guidance, and who bad nun sympathisers in the military, would have earned out their programme to the letter. The first anniversary of the death of Lalle- mand reunited the Paris students inl enthusiastic federation. The funeral having been forbidden, they affected to fix their rendezvous at the Buttes Chaumont; where; the price of their blood thew bad de* capital against invasion seven w Forming themselves into a long file, they silenUy At political junctures the students of Paris have seldom failed to assert themselves. The opposition of the younger generation to the Restoration had its origin in the Polytechnic School, which in 1810 refused to conform to certain religious observances. Fifteen pupils were expelled on the I2th of April, and next day the school was dissolved by the king. In 1 8 iq, when the cry of \"Liberty \"was resound ing through more than one European country, the Paris schools responded to the agitation. The lectures delivered by Nicholas Bavoux, professor of criminal law, caused between the Liberal students and certain Royalist auditors discussions which, but for the intervention of the dean and of armed force, would have degenerated into sanguinary conflicts. Bavoux's professorship w as suspended and the school of law closed. Prose cuted in a criminal court, Bavoux was acquitted by the jury and found himself the hero of the hour. At (irenoble, on 8th May, 1820, the law student- profited by the arrival of the Duke of Angouleme to make a public manifestation, in which they endeavoured to drown the cry of \" Vive le roi ! \" with that of \" Vive la charte ! \" Every day large groups of students stationed themselves outside the Palais-Bourbon to cheer the deputies of the Opposition, defenders of electoral liberty. Driven back from the Ouai d'Orsav by the gendarmerie, they reassembled mi the Place Louis XV., still shouting for the charter. Again forcibly displaced, they repaired in a mass to the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, where they fraternised with the working men. Thirty five were arrested. On Saturday, the third of June, new gatherings took place at the ap proaches to the Chamber in which the deputies sat. A descent was made upon them by the police. The students, who wore as their sign of recognition a white cravat as well as a buckle in front of their hats, rescued those of their friends who were taken prisoners. ( m the Place du Carrousel they snatched from the hands of the body-guards by whom he had been seized one of their comrades named Lallcmand. This young man, a law student of three-and-twentv, was at the selfsame instant struck by a bullet and killed. The death of Lallemand fanned"], [395, "THE REVOLUTION OF 1830.

A certain student, acting as . was hoisted by his comrade- mi to one of the highest walls in tlie cemetery, and spoke from thi- elevation as from an improvised tribunal. He invoked the shade of Lallemand, and called upon him to witness both the odious ation which pursued his memory and the solemn oath which everyone took, in presence of his tomb, to avenge him or die as he had died. An electric thrill ran through the crowd ; all fell on their knees in the dusty road, and bent their heads while the orator, turning towards the cemetery, bade Lallemand a last adieu. The column returned to Paris and defiled, bare- 1, along the Rue des Petits-Carreaux, past the house of Lallemand. The victim's father appeared at one of the windows, with his hand 1 to his heart, to show how deeply he was affected by this public protestation. attack on the Hotel de Ville another medical student, Labarbe, had both his legs broken, dying two days afterwards from the effects ofthe am putation, which he had undergone with a pipe in his mouth. Many a deed of heroism was done at this juncture by the Paris students, fighting like the populace for a Republic, which they did not obtain, and for which a disappointing compromise was furnished in the person of Louis Philippe. The political history, however, of the Paris students is too formidable to trace in anything like detail. In modern times these once ardent youths have shown themselves comparatively in different to politics, and have sought diver-ion from their studies rather in the cigar than in the sword or musket. The Paris student's general history, like that of everyone and everything French, consists largely of anecdotes. One of the best is a legend of a medical student who was not accus tomed to pay his landlady. Tired at length of waiting for her money, she paid him a visit at his rooms. The student, forewarned, received her with perfect self-composure. \" Sir,\" she exclaimed without circumlocution, as she crossed his thresh old, \" pay me or go.\" \" I prefer to go,\" was the reply. \" Very well then ; go at once.\" \" Pre cisely, madame ; and I shall go all the faster if you will consent to assist me.\" Thereupon he went to his chest of drawers, and from the top drawer took out a large skeleton. \" Would you,\" he said. \" be kind enough to place this at the bottom of my portmanteau ? \" \" What is it ? \" cried the lady, retreating a few paces. \" What is it ? Why, it is my first landlady. She had the indiscretion to demand three quarters' rent which I owed her, and then \u2014 mind you don't break it. It is No. 1 in my collection.\" \"Sir!\" exclaimed the lady, turning pale. The student, without replying, opened another drawer, and extracted a second skeleton. \"This,\" he said quietly, \" is my landlady ofthe Rue de 1'Ecole-de-Mcdecine, a most admirable woman, who, in like manner, had applied to me for two quarters' rent. Place it carefully on the other\u2014 it is No. 2. This,\" con tinued the student, \" is No. 3, an excellent woman, whom I had ceased to pay. Let us now pa to X.i. 4.\" The landlady fled, and her tenant wa- never thenceforth inconvenienced with applications for rent. Constantly engaged in political agitation, the students of Paris bore a formidable part in the Revolution of 1830. On the 20th of July the famous Ordonnances were issued. The same day meetings were held by the students, at which they resolved to take up arms. In the evening, at the Chaumiere ball, the quadrilles inpped in virtue of the new decrees. A thrill of indignation ran through the as sembly. The orchestra played the Marseillaise, and all present sang it in chorus. Hands were I, and vows uttered to conquer or die for liberty. The day afterwards intrepid student denounced the ordonnances in the public streets lied the citizens to arms. The pupils of lytechnic School passed the night in impro- i implements of war, and with Vanneau, a spirit, at their head, scaled the walls and hurried to the barricades, where the students of pital were mingled with the people.

The Chiffonnier, or Rag-picker \u2014 His Methods and Hours of Work\u2014 His Character \u2014 A Diogenes\u2014 The Chiffonnier de Paris. PERHAPS the most distinct type of character in Paris is the chiffonnier. Every evening, towards eight o'clock in the summer, and some what earlier in the winter, the streets of the capital are scoured by a class of individuals of both sexes, clad in sordid garments, who carry on their back a wicker basket, in their left hand a lantern, and in their right a stick with an in in hook at the end. A provincial or a foreigner might ask with curiosity what part these persons, so strangely armed, play in the social system ; but Parisians, to whom they have long been familiar, and to whom they are indeed historical, know them as the chiffon niers or rag-pickers. An observer, if he follows one of these wretched adventurers, will see him stop at every dust-heap lying along the thorough fares, previously to their being cleared away by the city scavengers. He rummages in these heaps, turning their contents over and over, and with the aid of his stick picks up and thrusts into his basket whatever objects will find a sale in his peculiar market. Not content wdth collecting those rags or chiffons from which he seems to have derived his name, he gathers up old papers, corks, bones, nails, broken glass, human hair, and even cats and dogs, which, contrary to the regu lations, have been flung dead into the -: Some of the more enterprising of these expl will, in defiance of the law, strip the walls or hoardings of their placards.

The chiffonniers of Paris can boast a history. They have played a part in their time, and once they were even invested with civil functions. li these functions were of a sad nature. In 1 826 M.

In [832, when the cholera invaded Paris, they figured amongst the licensed murderers who massacred those luck le-- persons whom ignorance and superstition had accused of poisoning the fountains. At the -ame period they smashed a number ot newly invented dust-carts, intended to clear the streets instantly of rubbish, so that they could only ex plore it at the depot where it was shot. The rag-pickers won the day. The authorities yielded before their violence and projected the relegated reforms into the future. sophical reflections therefrom. Thechiffon too, sketched by Gavarni are not mindless ti but profound reasoners. Let us glance at the character of thi picker as represented by a French writer ot keen observation. \"This chiffonnier,\" he says ries in him the stuff of a Diogenes. Like the latter he is content in his nomadic life, in hi, endless peregrinations, in his ragged independence He regards with infinite contempt the slaves who arc shut up from morning till night 111 a work shop, or behind a counter. Let Others, mere living machines, measure out their time by the hand- ofthe clock, he, the philosophical rag-picker, works when he likes, rests when he likes, without recollections of yesterday or thoughts of the morrow. If the north wind is icy, he warms himself with a few glasses of camphor, or a cup oi petit noir ; if the heat inconveniences him, he throws off part of his rags, lies clown beneath the shadow of his basket, and goes to sleep, li hungry, he hastens to earn a sou or two, and then feasts like a Lucullus on bread and Italian cheese. If he is ill, that matters nothing t.. him. ' The hospital,' he says, ' was not built for d Diogenes threw away hi.- basin ; the chiffonnier has no less a disdain for the goods of this m It was adrunken chiffonnier, uncoifed by his own lurchings, who addressed to his battered felt bat, lying on the ground, this apostrophe fulloflogk : 'If I pick you up, I fall ; if I fall, you will not help me up again. I shall leave you I ' Subject! all kinds of privations, the chiffonnier is proud because he feels himself free. He treats with haughtiness even the rag merchant to whom he brings the sheaves which he has gathered, and from whom he occasionally receives slight ad vances. ' If you don't want to buy of me, well and good ; I shall go elsewhere,1 he says, making a gesture as if to depart. Through the multitu dinous holes in his cat his pride is visible. He will say to the great ofthe earth : '(let out us my daylight.' \" The Chiffonnier de Paris, Felix Pyat's drama, fn-.-t produced at the Porte-Saint-Martin sh in 1S47, is admirable not only for its story andits dramatic power, but also for the fidelity f\u00ae which it reproduces the life of the rag-picker. Let us glance at this piece, in which hrede Lemaitre, a- the chiffonnier, achieved so great a triumph. In the prologue are represented two chiffonniers, who happen to meet on W Ouai Austerlitz, lantern in hand, I'\" evening. These men have begun life ver) e-ntly. One has assumed the crook as No one would expect to find among the Paris chiffoimiers a high moral standard; their work can scarcely have other than a degrading influence upi ui them. Their numbers arc recruited as a rule from the most infamous region- of the capital, and from a social stratum only just above that of the vilest criminality. It has often been said that count- aud marquises have sunk, by means of wine, card-, and so forth, into the ranks ofthe chiffonniers, even as a certain fraction of the English aristocracy are popularly supposed, after driving recklessly through life four-in hand, to end their career on the perch ofa hansom cab. In London, it is true, such things have happened, and men of title have been known to adopt even less heroic methods of livelihood than that of driving a hackney vehicle for hire ; they have \u2014 there is at least one contemporary instance \u2014 ground barrel-organs. But these are the very rarest exceptions ; and in Paris, although it is not theoretically impossible for an aristocrat to find himself reduced to the basket and crook ot the rag-picker, such a case would be an excep tion infinitely rarer still. So disgusting an occu pation would be absolutely the last to which a ruined gentleman would resort. The chiffonnier, however, despised as he is, figures a good deal in literature. A moving drama from the pen of M. Felix Pyat, and a vaudeville by MM. Frederic de Courcy, Sauvagc, and Bayard, have reproduced on the stage his manner- and customs. One chiffonnier named Liard passed for a philosopher, and has been treated a- such by more than one writer, and by at least one distinguished artist. He had descended from a higher station in life, and had suffered misfortunes. He would come out with Latin sentences on occasion. Scorning the wicker basket, he carried a simple wallet mi his shoulder.

The other has never known anything but rags and tatters. Just as the former is going ii into the dark waves of the Seine, which splash at his feet, his comrade, though drunk and to stand, suspends his hiccoughs and rushing towards him prevents the accom plishment ofthe fatal purpose. Then he reasons with the would-be suicide, and his bacchanalian eloquence prevails with the wretch, who, in a paroxysm of despair, cries : \" No, I will not kill myself_but I will kill ! \" At that moment a bank cashier, laden with money, passes by. The excited chiffonnier springs forward, seizes him by the throat, assassinates him, robs him, and flies. Father John, as the drunkard is called, has tried to prevent the tragedy, but the murderer, with a blow from his fist, has sent him rolling in the mud. When he gets up, sobered by the horrors of the moment, he hears the sound I if an apprt laching I. and escapes in order to avoid unjust sus picion. And now the curtain rises. Twenty years meanwhile have elapsed. Father John, a virtuous and pensive rag-picker, has not moistened his lips with wine since that fatal night, of which the memory pursues him like a nightmare. In ex piation for the drunken fit which prevented his staying the murderer's hand, he has set himself the task of watching over the daughter of the victim, Marie Didier, left alone and penniless in the world. Marie occupies a little room, bare of furniture, and near the sky, and here she struggles for a livelihood with her needle. She has nothing to divert her weary life but the visits of her \">our, Father John, who occupies the adjoin- both apartments being exhibited mi the stage.

She is surrounded, and de spite a partial resistance is dressed in the twink ling of an eye. Timid in her beautiful attire, she allows herself to be carried off by the friendly revellers, and just afterwards Father John comes back from his midnight prowl, and proceeds to examine the contents of his basket.

Towards the end of the examination, as he is raking about with his crook, he comes across a little bundle of thousand-franc notes, ten in number. \" What poor devil has lost these ? \" he exclaims. The idea of appropriating the treasure never once occurs to him. \" If there is an honest reward to be had,\" he says, \" I shall buy a new basket.\" Henceforth he will not close his eyes until he has discovered the possessor. To return to Marie. The stage is transformed into a sumptuously decorated saloon. Around a table sparkling with wax tapers and crystals the joyous companions of Henri Berville are perform ing the obsequies of his bachelorhood, for he is shortly to be married. Henri alone resists the general gaiety. He neither eats nor drinks, and the champagne bubbling in the glass or discharg ing its corks against the ceiling is powerless to relieve his melancholy. Suddenly the door opens and the band of laughing grisettes who have carried off Marie from her dreary room enter to the movement ofa polka. Marie follows them, but feels ashamed and bewildered ; so much so that she crosses her hands over her mask as though it did not sufficiently disguise her. Her companions, however, are ready enough to lift their masks to anyone who will admire their neat little noses or roguish eyes ; and presently one of the guests fastens himself on to the bashful Marie, and carries his insolence so far as to unmask her. In trying to escape, moreover, from his violent hands she tears a part of that precious robe which a year's toil would scarcely pay for. Henri Berville interposes and indignantly reproaches his friend with such behaviour. The friend replies with insolence, and a duel becomes inevitable.

Since their first meeting at the masked ball, Henri has sworn that he will marry her and no one else ; for indeed he has never loved Clara, whose hand was forced upon him, and who already has another less chivalrous lover, as events have only too painfully proved. Marie, deceived by the baron's representations, now resolves to sacrifice herself to Henri's welfare, and signs a false confession which has been pre pared for her, and by which she lays claim to a crime of which she is guiltless. Meanwhile Father John, brought before the commissary, is concerned with nothing but the demonstration of Marie's innocence. He speaks with such elo quence and grief, his accents are so real and heartrending, that the hesitating magistrate con sents to make experiment of a proof which the chiffonnier proposes. \"Lend me thirty thousand francs ! \" he cries. At this demand everyone present thinks him insane, with the exception of Henri, who promptly furnishes the loan. With the aid of this sum the chiffonnier obtains from the murderess of Clara's child conclusive evidence of Marie's innocence and the baron's guilt. Hoffman is brought to justice, and no obstacle remains to the union of Marie and Henri Berville. \" But how can we reward devotion like yours ? \" ask Henri and his- friends of Father John ; who, a true chiffonnier to the last, replies, \" Give me a new basket ! \" CHAPTER XXXV.

In this class you may find diplomatists who could overthrow the projects of Russia if supported by the power of France. Authors, too, administrators, warriors, journal ists, artists, belong to the order of Bohemians.\" A less flattering notion, however, of the Bohemian is given by Xavier de Monte-pin, who in his \" Confessions d'une Boheme \" describes the adventurer thus : \" A lost child of this great Paris, where all the vices have temples and all the bad passions altars and priests, the Bohemian cultivates, with dangerous skill, the worse side of human nature. Sometimes he is really clever and succeeds in deceiving the whole world, which for a moment accepts him. Then he is brilliant and proud, delicately gloved and fastidiously shod ; he has horses, mistresses, gold. Of this lying edifice, so elaborately con structed, not one stone, perhaps, will to-morrow rest upon another.\" It is to be hoped that Montepin was, in this case, generalising from a few very bad specimens. The present century has produced two genera tions of Paris Bohemians who have bit then mark upon the history of arts and letters. The first had its cradle in a now demolished house ol the Rue du Doyenne. Nothing could been more sombre or depressing than this street, which was one of the ugliest in Paris. Yet the indomitable spirits who made it their haunt lived within sight of all that the most artistic and delicate imagination could desire. There were the remains of the Hotel Ram bouillet, in which French literature had, in its infancy, been nursed ; the facade of the W resplendent with sculptures of the Renaissance; a cluster of trees, which might almost havi called a wood, in thebranches.il which feathered Bohemians trilled their songs of love and liberty. The walls of the house were old and bare ; but the inhabitants soon covered them with da tions of a magnificence scarcely to be found in palaces. There Corot painted his Provence landscapes and Chausserian his bacchants ; and there the earliest novels of Arsene Houssaye and the earliest poems of Theophile Gautier were penned. No troop of gipsies, encamped beneath foliage in the midst of a perfumed wood, ever led a more buoyant life. Comedy was played within those artistic walls ; masked balls were given ; the landlord and the scandalised citizens were defied. Years went by, and at last the Bohemians of the Rue du Doyenne had con strained the public to accept their ideals of art and literature. And now they were petted, feted, adored by those win > had previously taken them for fools. Yet even whilst Fortune was thus smiling, one famous member ofthe order\u2014 one who, in the eyes of posterity, personifies the Bohemians of this period\u2014 threw his fellows into mourning, Hie unhappy Gerard de Nerval\u2014 translator of Faust, friend and collaborator of Heine\u2014 was found one morning suspended from a street-lamp. So much for the first generation of Pans Bohemians. The second comprised, among others, Privat d'Anglemont, Auguste Vitu, Schanne, Alfred Delvan, Champfleury, and, above all, Henri Miirger. Their haunt was the Cafe Momus, in the Rue Pretres-Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois. This cafe has, within thi years, disappeared, and its site is now occupies by a colour-merchant's warehouse and broking establishment. The place resounds with the laughter, the reckless gaiety, the folly of Bohemians such as those just named. Like his counterpart in London, the Bohemian of Paris has usually long to wait for his hour of triumph. He has to pass through years of struggles and privations, to hunger and to thirst. He does not surrender, however ; tor he has an ardent faith in himself, and never loses the sheet anchor of hope. The life he leads has, more oxer, its seductive side, without which the bravest soul could not support it \u2014 hours of delightful illusion, the pleasures of study, the buoyant companionship of others engaged in the same warfare, and a free vent for the ex plosive gaieties of youth. Then there are the periods of discouragement and anguish, the unkindnesses of friends, the physical frame yielding even whilst the spirit defiantly holds out ; then, perhaps, despair or even death. Such things as these constitute the chequered life of the Bohemian. The Bohemia of Paris, according to Henri Miirger, is \" the stage of artistic life ; it is a preface to the Academy, to the hospital, or to the Morgue.\" This inevit ably reminds an Englishman of the old Grub Street Bohemian, the man of talent or genius who, in a few exceptional instances, struggled on, like Johnson, to greatness, but who, as a rule, thought Fortune had smiled when he could fill the vacuum in his stomach with four pennyworth of shin of beef ; who, after months of toil in his garret, would take his work to the bookseller's and return with a pocketful of guinea-, only to be penniless again on the morrow, to starve for another twelvemonth,"], [403, "MERGER'S VIE DE BOHEME 367 The Bohemian of Paris. | At the door of the little temple Death or Glory me- came and knocked, to summon one or other of its inhabitants away.

Every writer of distinction in Paris ed his bier to the grave; and the tomb ed to his memory is worthy of the man who slumbers beneath it.

In M. Ponsard's drama of Ho/incur et Argent the romantic but impecunious hero rushes forward at one critical moment to the front of the stage, exclaiming :Je porte des gants blancs, et je n'ai pas dine ! Hegesippe Moreau, Bohemian and true poet, who for want of a bed slept at times in one of the trees of the Champs Elysees, went one evening to a ministerial party, where, ex pecting to get something to eat, he was driven to despair at finding nothing to relieve his hunger except jellies and ices. It was probably in view of famished Bohemians that an old French book on etiquette warned persons invited out to dinner not, if the meal was long delayed, to exclaim : On ne nine jamais dans cette maison. A well known Bohemian, on being asked by a wealthy friend to take pot-luck with him at a certain hour, is said to have replied : \" With pleasure ; and you will excuse me if I am rather punctual.\" The first Bohemians of France must be looked for among her earliest poets. Francois Villon, for instance, who was publicly whipped, and the vagabond minstrels, one of whom in Victor 'ame so narrowly escapes hanging. But these lively, luckless bards were in the ion of the warriors who lived before the time of Homer, aud whose deeds were destined main unsung. The great student and chronicler of Bohemian life (whose \"Vie de Boheme,\" as translated into German, was 1 by a Leipzic bookseller under the head hnography) was Henri Miirger, with his four literary and artistic personages and their it, himself a Bohemian, who lends small of money to his masters out ofthe wages not receive, and who, in his love of the picture-que, finds himself unable to interfere with the beau desordre in which they leave their Highly ingenious are these four typical in getting rid of their money when there are funds in hand, and in making both when their purses are nearly empty. oi them having obtained a certain abiding relative, purchases for a man to whom he is attached a monkey t : \"illy to find, a few days afterwards, he monkey has eaten the parrot and died tion.

How indeed, without such a reflection, could he from day to day exist ? He remembers that when, during the first performance of Hernani, Victor Hugo was called out of the theatre by a bookseller and requested to accept 0,000 francs for the right of publishing the play, he had not more than forty francs in his actual possession. He may even, if he has studied the literary history of a neighbouring country, recall the case of Samuel Johnson, who for years had to live on fourpence a day. Even in the depths of poverty Bohemians, if there is anything in them, are sure (so Henri Miirger testifies) to make from time to time an impression upon some rich man, who will invite them to dinner, partly from sympathy and admiration, partly in order to have the oppor tunity of reading to them some poem or drama that vanity has impelled him to compose.

Whatever his antecedents may be, the Paris waiter invariably becomes fashioned after a certain ii-c-d type. This type is well described by a French writer in the following words : \" Vigour of constitution and honesty of soul are two qualities without which the cafe gaivoii would i-t. The master's eye cannot always be hovering over the bottles, the decanters, the cups, and the cossee-pt its of the laboratory. Nothing is easier than to divert, in the midst ofthe gigantic consumption which distinguishes certain estab lishments, an occasional drop from the ocean of refreshments and liqueurs ; a fraction of that total which the proprietor counts every evening, to the great annoyance ofthe late-staying customer exchanging his last ten-sou piece at midnight for a final petit verre. The garcon is there fore, of necessity, an honest man. From the rising of the sun to the extinction of the gas he is handling the money of others ; he is a confidential servant, a cashier on a small scale. As to vigour of constitution, you will soon see how indispensable that is to the garcon. Day dawns, and late as he went to bed the night before, he has to rise betimes. At that hour there is hardly anyone awake in Paris but fruiterers, scavengers, and water-carriers ; nevertheless he, the man of eloquence, who passes his time amongst epicures and who forms an indisputable the approach of day, the garcon is quit' regard as such the mewing of tbe cal shrill whistlings of Madame's canaries, v, anticipating a near visit from tbe chickweed merchant.

In the morning he is occupie entirely with dispensing cafe-au-lait.

From noon, however, till two o'clock black coffee and alcoholic liqueur absorb the waiter's energies. It is between those hours that gay consumers, with hearts already warmed by a visit to the neighbouring restaurant, arrive in troops and pay without counting their change. This, however, ling if we are to be guided by a certain M.

You would give the garcon two or three sous if you received good money, and you give him ten or twenty because he tenders a piece of money which you are afraid you cannot pas-.\" Although everywhere very much on the same pattern, the Paris garcon varies somewhat in his manners, customs, and general bearing according to the establishment in which he exercises his functions. There are cafes on the Boulevard des Italiens where he deviates somewhat from his traditional amiability, and, when a customer complains of the cafe-au-lait with which he ha been served, raises his eyes to the ceiling, sighs, places a fresh cup on the table, and filling it from the self-same coffee-pot, exclaims, \" I know you will like that, sir.\" The waiter of the Boulevard Saint-Martin is a man of letters, particularly conversant with dramatic literature. He picks up his education from the eminent actors and dramatists who frequent the establishment, and knows everything that is going on behind the scenes. At one time the garcon of the Cafe Desmares was an eminent authority on military matters. He knew all the superior officers of the Royal Guard, and everything that was whispered in the barracks. In course of time \u2014 after 1830 that is to say \u2014 he lost his martial tint, and became highly aristocratic ; speak ing in measured tones and looking exceedingly bored. Now, however, like the cafe itself, he is no more. The body-guards were accustomed under the Restoration to assemble at the Cafe Valois ; whilst the Bonapartists had their head quarters at the Cafe Lemblin. Challenges were sent from one cafe to the other, swords were drawn and duels were fought by the dim light of some street lamp. The weapons, it is said, were confided to the waiters of the belligerent cafe.-, together with the pipes of the frequenters. The intending duellist called for them as he would have called for a newspaper, and the waiter sometimes replied : \u2014 \" They are all in use, sir.\" The garcon aspires to wealth and greatness. Sometimes, in his vaulting ambition, he o'erleaps himself. Says a French student of his manners and customs : \" He takes a wife and a new house, puts frills on his shirt, and inscribes his name in the National Guard.

THK PARIS COOK. Brillat-Sa valid on the Art of Cooking -The Cook and the Roaster\u2014 Cooking in the Seventeenth Century\u2014 Louis XV.-Mme de M FROM the Paris waiter to the Paris cook the transition is, in literary phrase, \" easy and natural.\" There is probably no prouder per sonage in the world than this artist, who knows that mankind cannot dispense with him, and who, if one were to ask him whether the revolu tion of his spit or ofthe earth on its axis were the more important, might hesitate to decide. in the famous Vatel, who was so delicate mi the \" point of honour \" that he ran a sword through his own body because the fish which should have arrived for an important dinner he was cooking did not turn up in time. This artist was first attached to the intendant Foquet, afterv the Prince de Conde ; and he could not endure the shame of letting the king go short of one particular course in the dinner which tbe prince offered him at the Castle of Chantilly. In that excellent comedy from the combined pens of Emile Augier and Jules Sandeau, entitled Le Gcudre dc M Poirier, we see an illustration of the solemn importance which is attached by thc- French cook to a well-ordered menu. M. Poirier, an aspirant for social position, has married his daughter to a ruined marquis, Gaston de Nesle, win mi he soon finds to be a magnificently expensive son-in-law. One day, determined to retrench, he sends for his chef and asks what he intends to pre pare for dinner that day. The chef enumerates a list of some twenty costly and exquisite dishes; to which M. Poirier replies : \" You wdll replace all that by soup, roast meat, salad, and a fruit tart.\" The cook feels like a soldier required to chop wood with the sword with which he has been accustomed to cut his way to glory, and who prefers to snap that sword in two. \" I resign ! \" exclaims the cuisinier. \"No man will cook for you ! \" \" Then I will engage a woman,\" is the economist's base rejoinder. Some of the loftiest functions ot the Parisian chef can be performed by no one who is dowed with absolute genius. Training, experience, industry, will go some distance in thcFrench culin ary art ; but, according to Brillat-Savarin, in 1ns Physiologie du Gout, they would appareni qualify a man for the sublimer functions ot roast ing a joint or a fowl. \" On derient ciii'sini'er mais on unit rotisseur, exclaims this excellent writer, who raised the art ofthe- kitchen to the dignity of a science, and who propounds the maxims of cooking with the same gravity, the same sincerity, the sam. as if he were laying the bases of a gran philosophy. \" A dessert without cheesi beautiful woman with but one eye.\" he declared in a neat sentence which admits of only-' lum' beiing translation.

It was the renaissance of the kitchen as well as of the arts ; and Francis I. imported from Italy cooks as well as painters and sculptors. The Italian cooks viewed their art in a very serious light. Montaigne well portrays a typical member of their order. \" Just now,\" he writes, \" I was mentioning an Italian I have recently entertained, who acted as maitre d 'hotel to the late Cardinal Caraffe until his death. I made him describe his duties, and he gave me a discourse on this science of the jaws with a gravity and countenance quite magis terial, precisely as if he had been engaged. on some subject in theology. He indicated the different stages of appetite: that which exists after fasting, and that which remains when the first or second course has been served ; the methods em ployed, nswv simply to gratify it, now to awaken and spur itj. the policy with which he prepares his dishes, adorning and embellishing them so as to fascinate the eye. After that he entered upon the order of the service, full of fine and important considerations ; the whole inflated with a magni ficence of words such as characterises a treatise on the government of an empire.\" Louis XIV. was a great gastronomist, but in the refinements of the culinary art Louis XV. eclipsed his predecessor. The artists ol tin kitchen were not yet in his reign paid twenty thousand francs a year, as they have since been paid in Paris ; but they were petted, yielded tu, and stroked down when out of temper. The cooks from Languedoc were chiefly in demand at Paris ; they received very large salaries and exer cised domestic despotism, the other servants ol the household having to bow to their authority, The luxury of gastronomy was carried to such a point in France that edicts were issued by several French kings for the purpose of restrain ing it ; but the Italian cooks whom Catherine de Medici brought to the court of Henri II. easily contrived to vanquish the law. They formed a school and produced pupils who were destined to surpa-s their preceptors. Until the Revolution the profession of cook was regulated by a suc cession of statutes. So far back as 1260 the cor poration of \"goose-cooks\" (geese being their most important commodity) received statutes from the provost of the merchants. Later on the name of \" roasters \" was given to them ; and anyone not of their order who ventured to cook for the public was termed a traitor. The cooks of Paris had already been made the subject of many enactments when Louis XIV., in 1663, gave them new statutes which were registered in parliament the following year ; norwasit until the Revolution that their profession became free. Expense was nothing when it became a question of stimulating the jaded appetite of a count or a wealthy merchant. Mercie in his \" Picture us Paris \" shows us a maitre d 'hotel presenting the bill of fare to his aristocratic master, who throwi it down disdainfully, exclaiming: \"Always the same dishes ! You have no imagination. These are nothing but nauseating repetitions.\" \"But, monseigneur, the sauces are varied.\" \" I tell you the whole thing is detestable, and lean nolongO eat it.\" \" Well, monseigneur, I will prep a grilled boar.\" \"When?\" \"To-morroi make him drink sixty bottles of champagl And after that I want you to eat a Jamaica turtle.\" \" Bravo ! And when ? Where is the turtle ? ' \" In London.\" \" Send a courier at once : let him fetch it post-haste.\" The courier is despatched, and returns with the turtle. There is a conference as to the most effective way ol ing the animal ; and after all kinds of pi it appears on the table. That dish hi thousand crowns. Seven or eight gourmand, devour it, and while they are drinkim wines discuss the question as to how much a peasant can live on. They decide that three sous a day are enough for him, and that th inhabitants of the towns arc well off if they W In the seventeenth century the culinary art had reached a high pitch of perfection, and epi cures abounded in high life, amongst princes, seigneurs, and even bishops \u2014 indeed bishops in particular. One day when a certain archbishop famed for good living, in a sense otherwise than ecclesiastical, had dined at the palace of his episcopal brother in the- capital, he called his"], [411, "375 cook.i SCARRON AND MME.

Coining to the Re- in, we find the culinary art injured a good deal by the arbitrary closing of the mansions of the great nobility. Those thousand and one ruinous inventions without which courtiers, financiers, and id existence im- ile, were seductions for severe Republicans. A celebrated gastronomist, Gri- le la Reyniere, paints, in what he doubtless intended for very black tint-, the calamity which marked the revolu tionary period. \"It is an un- t,\" he writes, \"that during the disastrous of the Revolution not turbot entered the market \" ; and he has thus ed himself to Republican MADAME DE MAINTENON.

All the celebrities of the eighteenth century sat at the table of the la Reynieres, which was more sumptuously kept than Scarron's. There was first the grandfather, la Reyniere, who died in \u25a07:4 with a napkin under his chin, suffocated ie-foie-gras ; then the father, whose better than his society, if we ' judge from the remark passed upon h'm ' his guests, namely : \"You can eat him ; but digest him you cannot\"; and We have just mentioned the exquisite table which was kept by the inimitable Scarron. The time came, however, when his resources dwindled and the dishes laid before his distinguished guests were less numerous and less varied. The con versation of Scarron's vivacious wife, however, the future Mme. de Maintenon, did much to atone for a poor menu. On one occasion, whilst dinner was proceeding, Scarron received a secret message from his cook\u2014 who had to prepare the meal with very spare materials \u2014 to the effect that a certain dish, usually regarded as essential,"], [412, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW.

Turning his head aside from the guests, Scarron whispered to his wife : \" My dear. give them another of those charming little stories. There is no roast. So much for the ingenuity of a French host. The ingenuity of a French cook was perhaps never better exemplified than under the following circumstances. A rich financier was once dining at an aristocratic table where one of the courses consisted of some preparation of veal, highly gratifying to the palate. Whilst this course was being eaten one of the guests happened to say to the host : \" Your epigrams, you know, are excel lent.\" When the financier got homehe summoned his cook, told him he had just dined at a house where a ravishing dish of veal, mysteriously prepared, had been served, and directed the cuisinier to manufacture something like it, adding that he could not describe the precise nature of the dish, but that he- knew it was called an \"epigram.\" For a moment the cook was staggered. Then a sudden inspiration came upon him, and he declared that he clearly per ceived how epigrams should be prepared. Next day he invented an exquisite dish, which was des tined to become famous\u2014 to his own and his master's glory\u2014 as the \" Epigramme dc veau a la /inane.

Serious wounds were sometimes inflicted, and even the master would now and then step out of his vehicle and, with drawn sword, join in the affray. The coachman, meanwhile, prouder in livery than his master in braided coat, remained motionless on his box in spite of the blows which were being dealt around. It is related that when on one occasion a party of highwaymen attacked the carriage of Benserade, poet, wit, and dramatic author, his coachman sat calmly at his post, and amused himself with whistling whilst his master was being stripped of everything. From time to time\" he turned towards the robbers and said, \"Gentlemen, shall you soon have finished, and can I continue my journey ? The private coachman varied in those days, as he has always done, according to the position of the master or mistress whom he served ; and < Mercier, writing at a later period, indicates a \\ sufficient variety of cochers of this class. \"You can clearly distinguish the coachman of a < courtesan.\" he says, \"from that of a president; 1 the coachman of a duke from that of a financier ; : but, at the exit from the theatre, would you like to know where such and such a vehicle is going? Listen to the order which the master gives to the lackey, or rather which the latter transmits to the coachman.

' With the grandeur of this last word no one can fail to be impressed. At the theatre door stands a thun dering personage with a voice like Stentor, who cries; ' The carriage of Monsieur le Marquis!' 'The carriage of Madame la Comtesse!' ' The carriage of M. le President ! ' His terrible voice resounds to the very interior of the taverns where the lackeys are drinking, and of the billiard rooms where the coachmen are quarrel- ling and disputing. This voice quite drowns the confused sounds of men and horses.

There is generally one flower-girl in Paris who poses as a celebrity \u2014 cither on account of her beauty or of other quali- iore indefinable character. Fashionable : to her stall and pay fantastic- tor whatever bloom she pins to their breast. The flower-girl ofthe Jockey Club, w ho to attend the races aud ply her trade in the of the grand stand, expected a louis as a nary fee. There was once a charmingly pretty oyster-girl named Louise Leroux, known asLit belle ecaillerc. She had a lover named Montreuil, a fireman, who, in a moment of frantic jealousy, plunged his sword into her breast. This horrible crime at once rendered \"the beautiful oyster-girl \" famous, not only in Paris, but throughout Europe ; and in due time the legend of her life and love took dramatic form, and found its way to the stage. The interest excited in her unhappy end was all the greater inasmuch a- her murderer had eluded justice by flying to England, where, in London, he set up as a fencing master. The Gaiete Theatre achieved, in 1837, one of its greatest successes by putting on the boards, under the title of La Belle Ecaillerc. the tragic history of Louise Leroux. Since then the name has been familiarly applied without discrimination to the female oyster-sellers of Paris, many of whom have well deserved it. But \"bile bearing the name, they have aban doned the traditional fireman, as rather too dan gerous a commodity. In lieu of firemen they have captivated notaries, financiers, and others in superior stations of life ; whilst one is known to have turned the head of a state minister, who, even if he did not marry her, confessed the passion with which she inspired him by devouring thirty-two do/en ot her oysters every morning before breakfast. The flame within him had first been excited by the siren's ready wit. As he was entering a restaurant one day, a friend who accompanied him remarked: \"To-day, my -ir, more than ever, France dances on a volcano.\" \" What nonsense ! \" cried the ecaillhre ; \" she dances on a heap of oysters ! \" Next day the exclamation was reported in a Paris journal, which easily turned it to political account.

In Paris, although there are a great number of Eng- lishmen, it can hardly be said that an English Society exists. Samuel Johnson once com- plained that Englishmen did not fraternise with one another ; that if two visitors called upon a lad}- about the same time and were shown into her drawing-room, they would, until the lady made her appearance\u2014 say for five minutes \u2014 simply glare at one other in silence, whereas a couple of foreigners would, although they had never met before, have entered into a conversation. Without, perhaps, being aware of John- son's stricture on the social frigidity of his own countrymen, an excellent French writer, John Lemoinne, has noticed the same insular peculiarity in English visitors to Paris. \"The English,\" he says, \"do not seek one another's acquaintance; they do not come into other lands to find themselves. If they easily form acquaintanceship with foreigners, IS DE BOULOGNE, AT NIGHT. they are more fastidious in approaching each other. An Englishman will make friends with a Frenchman without the ceremony of presenta tion, I mean of introduction, but newer with another Englishman. A couple of Englishmen stare at each other very hard before saying, 'How do you do?'\" J'uiic/i many years ago noticed this national characteristic in a picture which represented two English visitors to Paris breakfasting at the same table in the Hotel Metirice, and, although the CHAPTER II. \\M> AMERICANS I\\ PARIS. \"1-M.

The influem convention in England is Mich that it equals and even surpasses the tyranny of the political administrative laws of the Continent. Th why the Englishman, after a stay of sonic time anil when the ice of his nature is a little melted, moves amongst foreigners as freely as lie moves at home. No possible comparison can be made between the Frenchman in London and tin. Englishman in Paris ; or at all events tin parison can only be an antithesis. The French man who pays a visit to England \\ull,su as presented, be welcomed with a boundless hospitality, provided his visit is only a flying om ; but if he apparently wishes to take root, the soil refuses, and society shuts itself up and ret i i though a descent were being made upon its territory. It must be confessed, moreover, that bi. nice is not usually represented in England by the cream or flower of her population ; and for .1 simple reason, namely, that a Frenchman not go to England for pleasure or fromch and that he has no idea but that of returnii quickly as possible. But apart, even, from particular circumstances, the mere p the English social atmosphere suffici - to asphyx iate a Frenchman. It is a world, an ina ideas, an assemblage of laws and customs cntnch different from all others. But M. Lemoinne goes further than Punch. \"If the English leave their native land,\" he says, \" it is not to find their own compatriots ; it is to sCC new men and new things. Even when you understand their language, they prefer to talk to you in their bad French. The thing is intelligible enough : they wish to learn, and have n<> desire to teach. You are regarded simply as a book and a grammar. The foreigner must be turned to some account.\" So tar excellent. But let Us return to Samuel Johnson. When he visited Paris did he air his \"had French\"? No, he absolutely refused to speak a word of anything but English. This by no means confirms M. Lemoinne's proposition. Yet in fairness, let it be said, Johnson's chief objection to talking French in Paris was a scal iest he should \"put his foot in it,\" and, lexico grapher a- he was, excite by some grammatical blunder the ridicule of irreverent Parisians. Let us see, however, to what lengths M. Lemoinne i- prepared to go. \" If there was ever a people who have the- sentiment of nationality, it is,\" be s.ivs, \"the English. They are impreg nated, petrified with it ; the thing is fatiguing and offensive. But in order to affirm and manifest this sentiment the English have no need to group them selves, to form themselves into a society. An Englishman is to himself England alone ; he carries hi- nation in him, with him, on him ; he does not require to be several. Everywhere he is at home : mosphere is his kingdom and the ambient air his property. Religion enters largely into this temperament. The Englishman carries not only his nation, but his religion with him ; he scours the whole earth with his Bible for com panion : the Frenchman, habitually catholic, requires a bell and a priest \u2014 he does not know how to converse directly with Heaven. From a social point of view, moreover, the English find France freer, more liberal, more 1 pen than their own country. English society, at home, is regu lated like music-paper ; it has a severe hierarchy, in which the most idiotic little lord stands before a man of genius without a title. Geo graphically, it i- a very narrow space which separ ate- England from France ; but this -pace isagulf. The two countries are in constant relationship; but they never arrive at any resemblance to each other. We have not the political liberty of the English, and they have not our social equality. An Englishman could not live with laws like those which, in France, regulate the right of \"A Parisian may for years walk round I society as he would walk round the wall of China, without being able to find either a door or a window.

It is a pleasure to see them, especially when you know that their appe tite is not destructive of sentiment.\" Now, how ever, for a compliment which is absolutely sincere. \" We venture to say that English society in Paris has exercised a salutary influence on French society, and that it has introduced cor diality into intimate relationships. The hand shake of the English lady, for instance, has long shocked, and still shocks our purists. Their fault is that they believe an amiable woman must be too accessible, and that a certain liberty of manners implies an equal liberty of conduct. With such ideas as these they bring up daughters who, having given the tips of their fingers, imagine that they have given everything and have no longer anything to protect; whereas a pretty little English girl who gives her hand gives nothing else, and knows how to defend the rest.\" far we have presented the observations of M. Lemoinne for what they may be worth. That hi> skilful pen, however, penetrates some times into the regions of truth is shown by the fact that his remarks not infrequently recall mi writers so famous as to be led more or les- a- oracular. Heine, after omplained that at an English dinner party the gentlemen, after the ladies had retired from the dining-room, remained at table for an hour or two to saturate themselves with port. Heine, it must be remembered, a perverse delight in satirising everything English. But that we, in England, do leave the drink their after-dinner coffee in the ition of the drawing-room must be hand- ly admitted. M. Lemoinne notices this irity. Another trait of the English character is, we are assured, an \"interest in religious questions.\" English ladies are \" all more or less theologians veritable doctors in petticoats. English girls will hold forth to you on the subject of grace and free will. You will meet them at church, listening to sermons and going through services, and even taking notes. But what does that matter, since it does not prevent them from serving out the tea admirably, from rearing their children later on, and from being model In tusewives and model mi ithers ? If our Frenchwomen cry 'Fie' upon the blue stocking, that is perhaps because it is too green ; a little theology would not hurt them. It is at church that you get the most comprehensive view of English society in Paris. On Sunday you have only to visit the Faubourg St. -Honore towards two o'clock ; you will encounter quite a procession of English men and women coming from the Rue d'Agnesseau, with their prayer-books and their Sunday demeanour. I say the church, but I ought to say the churches ; for the English have nowadays in Paris almost as man}- chapels as religions. There is the Embassy chapel for Anglicans ofthe established religion, an English episcopal chapel iu the Rue Bayard, another English chapel in the Rue Royale, a Scotch Presbyterian chapel and two English Methodist places of worship in the Rue Roquepine, inde pendently of American chapels. This is not to say that the English observe Sunday in Paris as strictly as they are obliged to do in their own country. Rc-spect for the Sabbath is an observ ance which they know very well how to dis pense with amongst foreigners. On Sunday, \"The time has passed,\" he says \u2014 with burlesque drollery \"when the true Englishman rein. lined at table for several hours after dinner and ended lumbering beneath it. Now, when the have quitted the dining-room, the gentle men content themselves with circulating the tor twenty minutes. In France we are beginning to divest ourselves of certain ruing the English.

Curiously enough, the Americans, although they despise or affect to despise social and logical distinctions in their own country, turn to some extent into aristocrats during the voyage across the Atlantic to Europe. Frenchmi n hue noticed that if you wish to be presented to their minister or at one of their drawing-ro Paris, you must never forget your ancestry. \"A certain author of my acquaintance,\" says Andre1 Leo, \"a man of genuine fame, was sufficient!) astonished, on reading his American letter ol introduction, to find that it recommended him much less on his own account than on that ot When the New York party has cashed its cheque at the American bank \u2014 which is quite a rendezvous for trans- Atlantic's and at which all the American new -paper- can be seen \u2014 the feminine element hasten- to visit all the most fashionable shop-, d'he ladies are eager to purchase, at comparatively low prices, those Parisian costumes which their own native custom-house raises to price- so exorbitant. d ere long in the richest and newest fashions, they step with their male companions into a carriage and drive to the Bois de Boulogne ; then they go to the opera, to spectacle- ot every kind, and to the Legation.

For it must be confessed that the Americans are fond of the pomp- of this world, and that, Republican- as they profess to be, they have no prejudice against kings and princes outside their own country. The monarchs of other nations neither shock nor terrify them. And the American tourist, apart from the que-'. ion of political sentiment, likes to see everything and do every thing before he recrosses the Atlantic. If an American family vi-its a land where it is the fashion to be presented at court, they will feel humiliated and ashamed should they have to confess afterwards to their compatriots that they missed the presentation. his grandfather.

The one point on which, in M. Andre's view, the studious American woman exposes herself to reproach, is that hitherto she has not used her intellectual superiority for the furtherance of her own dignity and independence. In the United States, so soon as a merchant has done some great stroke of business, or has pierced a big vein of ore in his mine, or has seen the petroleum spouting up on his land too fast for au adequate supply of barrel-, his daughters are ined with a desire to \\ i,-it Piurope. They hither, accompanied by the father, who pretends to despise the Continent, but who, inwardly, is scarcely less curious to explore it than his fair-haired children. And as a matter of fact the Americans may well be e that region of the world whence they derive everything but their liberty and their wealth. For their religion, their age, their literature, their arts and sciences, their memories, and the very blood which i their veins, they are indebted to pe. In America, although an enormous number of books and newspapers are published, the English and F'rench classics, not to mention the- be-t English and French modern authors, die foundation of every good library, and the native writers fashion themselves after European models. That she is nevertheless a powerful social factor, M. Andre himself admits, though he attributes this less to her activity than to her fascinations as a beauty in repose. \" The hist duty and the first pride of an American husband is,\" he says, \"to ensure the idleness of his wife and provide for the expenses of her toilette. There are in the United States many women workers, whether as preceptresses or clerks in the postal, telegraphic, or even ministerial offices. These are nearly all spinsters \u2014 the single state being frequent in New Fingland, which vies with the Mother Country for the supremacy ot the feminine population- and they give in their resignation when they get married. \" I will not let my wife work,\" such is the husband's proud determination. Here, however, one imperative reason why women must resign their employment on marriage is overlooked. In London the numberless women engaged in the post and telegraph offices are required by the authorities to abdicate their posts on becoming wives, simply because they would obviously be unable to work their nine hours a day at a desk or counter if they had absorbing domestic duties to attend to and children to rear. As regards the American families residing in tor the education of their children, it is and the French language which they have in view. Some years ago M.

The services, too, of coach men, landladies, lodgers, were called into requisi tion.

Stories are even told of men so innocent that thew acted as spies without being aware ot it. Such a one was Michel-Perrin, of Mme. de Bawr's tale, which, in its dramatic form, gave Bouffe one ot his best parts. The simple-minded man had in his youth, when he was a student ot theology, known Fouche, afterwards to become Napoleon's Minister of Police. In due time Michel-Perrin took orders, and was doing duty in a little village when, under the Revolution, public worship was abolished. Calling upon Fouche to ask his old friend for some suitable employment, he can obtain nothing until, moved by the urgency of his solicitations, the Police Minister suggests to him, with so much delicacy that his true meaning remains unperceivcd, that he shall walk about the public places, go into cafes and restaurants, and frequent all kinds of resorts where people congregate, and that he shall then return to Fouche with an account of anything remarkable he may have seen or heard. This seems to the delighted Michel-Perrin mere child's play, and he regards it as little more than a pretext on the part of the generous minister for handing him every evening a gold piece. When, however, the unconscious spy finds one day that he has revealed a political conspiracy, and jeopardised the lives of many, perhaps innocent men, he suddenly awakens to a sense of what he has been doing, and in horror throws up his em ployment. Fouche, it seems, was pained to have humiliated the unoffending priest, and, public worship being just at that time restored, he used his influence with Napoleon to obtain the in genuous man's re-appointment as village cure. L'nder the Revolution the spy was replaced by the official denunciator, an agent no less formid able. At length came the Empire, and then Fouche invested espionage with the importance of a science. In 1812 the \"brigade of safety\" appeared, which was first composed of four agents, but which, in 1823 and 1824, always under the direction of the famous Vidocq, numbered close upon thirty. Delavau, the prefect of police, had permitted him to establish, on the public road, a game known as \" troll-madam \" ; and this game, an excellent trap for boobies and passers-by whose slightest words and actions were keenly watched by Vidocq's hounds, produced, from the 20th of July to the 4th of August, 1823, a net profit of 4,304 francs. This sum was added to the sub vention already granted to the spy department. The Prefect Delavau returned to the method of Lieutenant Berryer in employing as spii victs, whom he threw back into prison for the slightest fault. One of his predecessors. Baron Pasquier, had endeavoured, like Berryi enlist domestic servants into the secret p force ; and, with this object, Delavau ren an old ordinance, calling upon them to get their names noted in the books of the prefecture 1 time they entered a situation or left one. domestics, however, perceived the motile ol Delavau's measure, and were so unanimous in withholding their names from the hooks m question, that all idea of family espionagi which much value had been set, was soon to be abandoned. Delavau drew even more lai upon the criminal class for his myrmidons than Pasquier had done, and in his day no public gathering took place at which some felon, re leased for the purpose from gaol, was notlurking about for an ill-sounding word or a suspii gesture. Such agents as these worked will industry of bloodhounds. \" Between the popu lace and the subalterns of the police,\" says the historian Peuchet, \"there is a continual war; the latter are ill-bred dogs who seize- - opportunity for applying their fan-- The police will never inspire respect for order so as part of its force consists of released gaol-birds who owe a grudge to the whole of thi pe \\\\ hen these two elements are in contact tin inevitably a fermentation.\" The these remarks was recognised by M.

Theophile Gautier, in his dramatic feuilletons, has frequently shown that he preferred the equestrian fairy of the circus to the sylph who dances at the opera. He goes into ecstasies mer her agility, vigour, and courage, and is displeased with nothing but the drapery in which her lower limbs are enveloped, holding that, just as the most virtuous fashionable woman or actress takes care to exhibit her bare arms if they are beautiful, so the \" ecuyere \" of the circus should be allowed to display the full symmetry and grace of her legs. The \"ecuyere\" whom Balzac bring- on the scene in his Faitssc Maitrcssc, Malaga by name, is an excellent type of the French circus woman, who is nearly always without relatives, sometimes a foundling, sometimes a stolen child, and who, coming one knows not whence, goes, the idol of a day, one knows not where. \" At the fair,\" says the greatest of French novelists \u2014 or rather, one of his characters \u2014 \"this delicious Columbine used to carry chairs on the tip of her nose \u2014 the prettiest little Greek nose I ever saw. Malaga, madame, is skill personified. Of Herculean strength, she only requires her tiny fist or diminutive foot to rid herself of three or four men. She is, in fact, the goddess ol gymnastics. Careless as a gipsy, she says every thing that enters her head ; she thinks as much of the future as you do of the halfpence you throw to beggars, and sometimes sublime things escape from her. No one could ever persuade her that an old diplomatist is a beautiful youth ; a million could not change her opinion. Her love is, for whoever inspires it, a perpetual flat tery. Endowed as she is with really insolent health, her teeth are thirty-two exquisite pearls encased in coral.\" Another variety of police spy to be met with in Paris is the officious volunteer spy. He may 0 to the lower or to the higher rank- of ty. He takes upon himself to observe and to denounce, without instructions, and solely in the hope of a pecuniary recompense. This variety is probably the most contemptible and the vilest. It should be mentioned, too, that the French capital swarms with invisible and un- disguised, as they some times are, beneath an appearance of luxury or ificence. This or that personage passes for a member ofthe diplomatic service. He is an ad mired figure in fashionable drawing-rooms, and while affecting to converse on the European situation, exercises the ear ofa fox terrier and the of a hawk. Then, of course, there is the militarv spy, who i- superior to the civil variety inasmuch as whilst the latter, in case of recogni- , only incurs a more or less disagreeable idventure, the former is liable to be shot. The military spy, therefore, may have all the ai of the professed soldier. The civil spy system was naturally developed extraordinary degree by the subtle Riche lieu.

The French Servant, as described by Leon Gozlan and by Mercier\u2014 The Ccok and the Cordon Bleu\u2014 The Valet. IT' has already been seen that domestics have at different periods been employed in Paris as According to Leon Go/dan, writing of his own period, \" the police of Paris is almost entirely occupied with the misdeeds of domestics. Nearly all domestics are thieves or spies, and they get more -o a- they grow older. The most honest aiiiong-t them steals at least ten sous a day from his ma.-ter.\" It is to he hoped that if they steal in this amusingly regular fashion, they at least observe the kind of morality which has been noticed in some of the inferior state officials of Russia. One of these complained that a col league of his was dishonest and helped himself to thing- which belonged to the State. \"But you do the same thing yourself,\" suggested a friend. \" True,\" was the reply ; \" but this fellow steals too much for his place.\" England the domestic is a nonentity. The man-servant or maid-servant who waits at an English table is absolutely ignored, and is not even supposed to understand the convi which accompanies dinner, nor to laugh at jokes indulged in by the host or his gui English servant nowadays who shook with laughter at what he overheard in the dining room, like black Sambo at Mr. Sedlej ' be cautioned if not cashiered. The domestic is a personage and a power. The \" trade of lackey,\" according to Fabrice, in \"Gil Bias,\" requires a man of superior intellect. The true lackey \" does not go through his duties like a ninny ; he enters a house to command rather than to serve. He begins bi ll is master : he notes his delects, gains his confidence, and ultimately leads him nose If a master has vices, the genius who waits upon him flatters thi often indeed turns them to his own ad-.

The French domestic, whether valet, lackey, or lady's-maid, is more important and influential than the domestic of England. It is true that occasionally in an English house some servant practically rules the family, and that the relation ship between employer and employed becomes so reversed that the mistress is afraid to ring her drawing-room bell. As a rule, however, in"], [451, "A FAIR."], [452, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW.

In like manner the house-porter, or \"concierge,\" takes for himself, as a matter of course, so many logs out of every basket of wood ordered by the different tenants, of whom there are often some half-dozen in the same house. In France, as in other countries, a valet will sometimes wear his master's clol and the Parisian lady's-maid asserts and enfi more perhaps than in any other capital, her claims to her mistress's cast-off apparel. he might simply be an ape in his masters clothes.

Mercier, all the same, repre sents the Paris domestic as hardly less a rogue than does Leon Gozlan. \" Out of ten servants,\" lu assures us, \"four are thieves.\" Another native writer, while not undertaking to combat thi- proposition, finds a defence for the accused domestics. \" If they are thus, who,\" he asks, \" has perverted them? Who, either by example or complicity, has made them thieves and spies? Every year is committed, to the pre judice of the country and of agriculture, an abominable crime, namely, the stealing of individuals, strong and useful, snatched at once from the sunlight ami from simplicity of manners, to be degraded, and sullied with a livery ; to have imposed upon them their master's vices and follie-, ami to be turned into idlers and good for-nothing-, flatterers and procurers.\" The cook \u2014 both the \"cuisinier\" and the \" euisiniere \"\u25a0- has already been dealt with in a special chapter. It may here, however, be remarked, that though the best cooks, and certainly the most expensive ones, arc in Fi as in other countries, men, the female cook is far indeed from being held in disesteem. The \" cordon bleu,\" or blue ribbon, was a distinction conferred upon the female, not upon the cook ; and a woman who cooks particularly well is called to this day a \" cordon bleu.\" Sui woman was in the service for many years of the well-known \" bourgeois de Paris,\" as Dr. \\ loved to describe himself. If every French servant looks for some particular perquisite, they all expect a gral at the New Year. One of the greatest cursi greatest blessings which rest upon Paris is the custom of presenting New Year's gifts. The word \" etrenne \" is at once a terror and a j Parisians, according as they belong to the class who give or the class who receive. In London no gentleman would venture to omit at Chnst mas-time to \"tip\" any one of the und had ewer cleaned his boots, lifted his portmanteau. or twisted the ends of his moustache. But in I if a gentleman failed at the new year to pn \"etrennes\" to his boot-black, his me his valet, derision and infamy would, according to a French writer, pursue him, not merely throughout this life, but even beyond the tomb. Cardinal Dubois, who had a reputation I' niggardliness, used to give his servants their \"etrennes\" in a manner which they could hardly hive relished. His major-domo came to him one New Year's Day to demand the annual gratuity. \" Etrennes\"! \" exclaimed the cardinal; \" yes, i\" will give you your etrennes. You may keep everything you have stolen from medunng the last twelvemonth.\" Paul Louis Courier looked forward to the time when domestic servitude would be replaced by hold service rendered freely, as if in virtue of a contract between man and man ; and in Paris, a- in other capitals, thi- state of things seems to be fast approaching, not as the result of any benignant feeling on the part of the rich towards the poor, but because, with the spread of education and of democratic idea-, a disin clination to remain constantly at the orders of another person is gradually extending. Already servant- demand a greater number of holidays than in ancient times ; and there are many who, like the London charwoman and the \"laundress\" of the Inns of Court, are ready to give their services during the day-time, and even until a late hour in the evening, while reserving to themselves the right of returning, after their labours, to their own domicile. There is much to be said, no doubt, on the Other side. If there are masters and mistresses without consideration for their servants, there are servants who, having kind masters and mistresses, show themselves without gratitude.

He has been described as the corresponding type, in English society, to the man retired from business. He lives modestly in the quarter of the Marais or of the Batignolles, as in England he might live at Clapham or Brixton, at Holloway, or Camden Town ; and he passes a considerable portion of his time in some favourite cafe, reading a news paper of moderate-liberal politics, or playing at dominoes. Condemned to economy, some times of the most parsimonious kind, he counts every lump of sugar brought to him by the waiter, and shows a great predilection for halfpenny rolls.

THE STREETS. The Arrangement of the Streets\u2014 System os Numbering the Houses- Street Nomenclature\u2014 Street Lamps\u2014 The Various Kinds of Vehicl, WE have already searched the streets ,.| Paris for tvpes of character. Let us pro ceed to look at one or two characteristic street objects, after first taking a general view of the streets themselves. The streets of Paris divide themselves into two categories : those parallel to the Seine and those at right angles to it. In the first the numbers follow the course of the stream, in the second they begin from that end of the street which is nearest to the river. The traveller, however, finding himself in any particular street, cannot in the present day tell at once to which category it belongs, inasmuch as the old distinction of colour is no longer preserved, by which the parallel streets used to be numbered in red, and those at right angles in black. All the Paris streets are lit up throughout the night. Early in the morning, before daylight, companies of scavengers collect the citv refuse in heaps which, some hours afterwards, are carted away into the neighbouring country to fertilise the soil. During the day other scavengers clear the highways of whatever dust or mud thev may have accumulated. Every day in summer water-carts sprinkle the principal thoroughfares. These carts carry behind them an apparatus which flings the water over the whole width of the street. In streets which are rather narrow, or when the cart cannot keep exactly to the middle, the pedestrians come in for a part of the municipal sprav, as also do vehicles which are low or open. It is prudent, therefore, to keep one's eye on the water-cart, unless a gratuitous shower-bath is absolutely desired. Every public way bears a distinctive name. Extended thoroughfares are not infrequently divided up into portions, each named separately ; this is due sometimes to local circumstance-, sometimes to the fact that in the olden days it was a caprice of the citizens frequently to change the title- of the street in which thev resided. It was not until the seventeenth century that the municipal administration officially intervened in this matter. Then, however, the titles were less often derived from local circumstances, adulation lavishing on the highways and byways the names of princes and other personages of wealth or power, ruder Louis XIV. a certain proportion ol street names were also drawn from royal victories or from those officers who had achi them. The Revolution inscribed with the i of its heroes, its martyrs, its triumphs, its prin ciples, not only the new streets which it opened, but even the old ones from which it wished tu efface monarchical titles. The Empire foil the same svstem. The Restoration return the Royalist traditions; and the monard July united those of the Revolution and the Empire, mingling the ancient glories of Fi with the modern, and illustrious foreigners with natives of renown. To pass, however, front streets to illumination. Parisians ofto-dav, accustom the brilliancy of gas, which turns night almost into day, can scarcely believe that two ago their town knew no other light than that ot the moon and stars. It was the case, neverthe less ; previously to 1667 not a public lamp ev The necessity of street illumination had already, however, been recognised by a civic regulation which required householders, in those localities where garrotting had become too frequent, to place beneath their first-floor window, at a p.m., a lantern which might cast its beams im street. It was M. de la Reynie, lieutenant of police for Paris, who first, in 1667, instil public lamps. At the outset a lamp was placed at the end of each street, with a third in the middle. Then, after a time, the numb. lamps was increased in streets of 1 length. Each containing a candle, these \" Ian ternes\" were suspended by a rope from a crooked iron bar in the form of the gallows.

Until the- time- of the Revolution the right of letting out carriages was always made the subject of a privilege or concession, accorded to court favourite, male or female. After the Revo lution, however, when all privileges were abolished, those connected with the lettin of public vehicles came to an end.

Francois is said to have been the \" last man tied up to the illuminated gallows \" of the Place de la Greve. Camille Desmoulins published, some eighty years before Henri Rochefort made use of the title, a pamphlet called \" La Lanterne,\" or, to quote the title in full, \" Discours de la Lan terne aux Parisiens.\" It bore this epigraph : \"Oui male agit odit lucem,\" which he translated thus : \" Only rogues fear the light.\" If, however, the public lamps of Paris are the most conspicuous street objects by night, those which first strike the eye by day are unquestion ably the vehicle.-. In France, as in other countries, carriages are comparatively of modern invention ; and when they were first introduced they were generally condemned as calculated to do away with a taste for equitation and to produce habits of effeminacy. The condition of the streets and public thorough fares would, in ancient times, have rendered the employment of vehicles impossible, and thus persons who did not goon foot went on horse back until the sixteenth century, when the use of the so-called \" Sedan-chairs\" became general. Wheeled carriages were not absolutely unknown, but in Francis L's reign there were but two, one belonging to the king, the other to the queen. The privilege of constructing and letting out Sedan-chairs, or \"chaises a bras,\" was granted by Louis XIII. at the beginning of the seventeenth century to one of the officers of his body-guard ; and towards the end of the reign, after many other inventions in the way of vehicles had been tried, two-wheeled chaises, called \" brunettes,\" or \" wheelbarrows,\" were introduced by a Monsieur Dupin, who received the king's support in the shape ofa formal authorisation. There was now a great dispute between the privileged makers of Sedan-chairs and the privileged makers of \" wheelbarrows,\" which ended in this com promise \u2014 that the new wheelbarrows were not to be allowed unless drawn exclusively by men. In the reign of Henry IV. the carriage, or \" carrosse,\" was introduced : a heavy, lumbering vehicle, whose windows were hung with leather curtains. The use of glass in carriage windows had not yet been adopted. Henry IV. was him self driving in one of these carriages when"], [461, "PARIS VEHICLES.

They take up their passenger at his own door, and can be hired by the year, month, day, or half-day. The form of these vehicles varies, according to the caprices or the fortune ofthe hirer, from plain to magnificent. In France, as in England, rich families accustomed to winter in the capital leave their own carriages in the country and hire others by the month. Even wealthy Frenchmen, who reside altogether in the capital, have of late years shown them selves more and more disposed to escape in this way the trouble and annoyance connected with the maintenance of personal equipages.

In 1863 it was replaced by the present bridge, constructed in stone, with five elliptical and very graceful arches. To the bridge of Bercy succeeds the bridge of Austerlitz, whose name connects it with one of the greatest battles of the First Empire. Begun in 1802, it was finished in 1807, and was called the bridge of Austerlitz in menu iry of the important victory gained on the 2 nd of December, 1805, by Napoleon, over the arms of Austria and Russia. When in 18 14 the allied armies were in possession of Paris, some observa tion was made to the Emperor Alexander of Russia by a time-serving French official as to the name ofthe bridge, which, it was suggested, might be changed. \" I do not mind the name,\" replied Alexander, \" now that I have crossed the bridge at the head of my troops.\" More sensitive, or at least more irritable than the Russian emperor, Blucher took umbrage at another of the Paris bridges being called, in commemoration of the great Prussian defeat, bridge of Jena, and really wished to blow it up. He was dissuaded from this project by the Russian emperor, who, according to an anecdote more or less veracious, said that if the Prussian marshal thought seriously of carrying his project 27"], [466, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW. 34 into execution, the emperor would take up his position on the bridge and perish with it. Under the Restoration the name ofthe bridge of Austerlitz was really changed. It was hence officially designated Bridge of the King's Garden, but continued in general parlance to be called by its original name. A little below the bridge of Austerlitz the Saint-Martin canal pours its waters into the river ; and not many yards lower down the Seine met formerly the island of Louviers, on which there were no habitations, but only ware houses for wood. The narrow channel which separated this island from the right bank ofthe river was filled up in 1847, when, in a geograph ical sense, the island ceased to exist.

The island of Saint-Louis communicates with the left bank, from which the main stream separates it, by the foot bridge of Constantine and the bridge of Latournelle.

Something of the kind, however, was known long before, and in atieie chronicles a morgue, where dead bodies were ex posed, is spoken of as far back as the early daj of the seventeenth century. In its existing form the Morgue isa one-storied building, with wings, and with slabs of black marble in W lines, for the reception of twelve buuics. . Close to the Pont de Latournelle is the Pont Marie, of which the first stone was laid in 1614 by Louis XIII. and Marie de .Medicis. The bridge, however, is said, according to a somewhat improbable statement, generally accepted by the historians of Paris, to owe its name, not to the queen, but to Marie, a well-known builder ofthe time. The next bridge, as we continue to descend the stream, is the Pont Louis Philippe, the date of which is indicated approximately by the reign under which it was built. Begun in 1833, it was finished in 1834, but since then has undergone many restorations and modifications.

It had for its cradle that left bank of the Seine which was then separated from the town and its suburbs, and divided into two quarters subjected to special jurisdictions ; the University and the vast territory of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pres. Was it not natural, despite the jealous vigilance of the Sorbonne, that the Paris schools where Abailard had boldly attacked school-divinity should be the first to awake to the new spiritual life ? \" A professor of the college of Cardinal Lemoine Lefevre, d'Etaples by name, produced in 1512, within the precincts of the Abbey, his \" Commen tary on St. Paul,\" in whose epistles he indicated, five years before Luther, the essential doctrines ofthe Reformation.

The priestly rage which had now been excited soon spread to the people, and the streets began to resound with cries of \"Death to the Heretics.\" \" d'o be thrown into the river,\" says Beze, writing of this period, \" it was only necessary to be called a Huguenot in public, no matter what one's religion might be.\" A series of religious murders were now perpe trated ; and Francis I., a bigot like his people, headed one day in 1555 a procession in which he wa- followed by his three sons, the court, the parliaments, the trade corporations, and the brotherhoods, and of which the object was to burn at the stake six Protestants at six different halting-places. Henri II. took after his father. On one occasion he assisted, from a window ofthe Hotel de la Rochepot, Rue Saint-Antoine, at the execution of a Protestant tailor who was burned alive. It is said, however, that the martyr's eyes, fixed as they were upon him, inspired him with terror, and that this was the last heretic whose dying pangs he ever witnessed. before the body was finally consigned to the flames. The Protestant poet, Clement Marot, to whom Francis I. had given a house, called the \"Ho the Bronze Horse,\" translated at this i of the Psalms into French verse, and his work obtained extraordinary vogue even at the court. The students, who used to amuse themselves in the evening in the Pre aux Clercs, opposite the Louvre, replaced their customarj the Psalms of Marot ; and it became the fashion si >r a time among the lords and ladies of the court to cross the Seine in order to hear the chants ot the students. Often they joined in ; and the Huguenot king of Navarre, Antoine de Bourbon, was seen walking round the Louvre and sir a psalm at the head of a long procession ol courtiers and scholars. The persecution, which fora time had slack cned, was soon revived in all its fury. Marol took flight. Paris had grown too hot for him ; \" Paris,\" he says, in an epigram dated 1537, \" Paris, thou hast given me many a fright, even to the point of chasing me to death \" :\u2014 \" Paris, tu m'as fait maints d'allarmes Jusqu'a me poursuyvre a la mort \" In spite of everything the deputies of the reformed church continued to meet at Paris in tin- Faubourg Saint-Germain, where they held secretly their first national synod in 1 55'' \"lh assembly, of which not one member would have escaped the block had they been disi bound into one corporation the re-formed churches of France, until then without cohesion.

The edict of January having granted to the Protestants a certain tolerance, Guise, who boasted that he would cut this edict in half with his sword, proved his word by the massacre of Vassy. The Protestants of Paris were terrified at this tragedy, but would not be discouraged.

The extermination of the heretics had for a considerable time past been recommended to Catherine de Medicis by Philippe II. , by the Duke of Alva, and by Pope Pius V. The queen, long irresolute, decided suddenly, just when the Guises had aggravated the situation by causing Coligny to be assassinated. Catherine, as we have seen in a previous chapter, obtained, at the last moment, the consent of the king ; but it was Charles's brother and successor, Henry III., who took the direction of the massacre and posted himself in the middle of the bridge ot Notre Dame in order to have both banks beneath his eye. We know how the signal for the tragedy was given by the bell of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois, and how Coligny was the first to feel the Catholic steel.

Even Ablon proved inconveniently distant, although it was nearer the capital than the edict permitted. The difficulties and dangers of the journey to this spot were great. The Protestants often went by water, and several were accidentally drowned. A petition presented to the king set forth that forty infants had died through having been carried in winter to baptism at Ablon. At length the king found that his own Protestant ministers could not render their duties to God and to himself on the same day ; and Henry IV., yielding to the influence of Sully and of Calignon, assigned to the Protestants of the capital, as their place of meeting, Charenton, two leagues distant. Many illustrious persons still belonged to the reformed religion. But gradually the aristocratic families were bought over to the other side ; and the Jesuit Garasse declared that the church ol the Protestants would soon be a church of bej The unhappy Protestants did not in an\\ neglect their poor ; and as it was found impos sible to keep priests and monks out of the hospitals, which were constantly invaded by them, the chiefs of the reformed religion established hospitals in secret place-, which, however, were closed as soon as Catholic clergy or the public discovered them. In 1000 the Parliament of Paris interdicted these charitable establishments by a formal decree. From that time the street and the faubourg of Saint-Antoine were traversed on Sunday by crowds of Huguenots, in carriages, on horseback, or on foot ; and for their protection two fresh gibbets had to be erected, one in the name of the Lieutenant of the Town, the other in that ofthe Chief of the Watch. Many of the Huguenots now went to Charenton by water.

Often the Huguenots returning from Charen ton, where on Sunday they would pass the entire day, were attacked ; on which an appeal was made to the king, who took the part of his former co-religionists. The death of Henry IV. was a terrible blow to the French Protestants, who were now at the mercy of the Jesuits, of Catherine de Medicis, and of her Florentine advisers, such as the Concinis.

Meanwhile some of the Protestants who still ventured to stay at Paris continued services at the English Embassy, or at the lega tion of the United Provinces. Instead of one chaplain the legation of the Dutch Republic maintained two. But an edict was soon passed forbidding French Protestants to attend worship in the chapels of any of the foreign ministers.

Under the ancient regime, the complaint against it had been that it rejected much which ought to be believed.

It had already flourished with Longfranc, Saint-Anselme, Abailard, and Pierre Lombard before bearing riper fruits with Albertus Magnus and Saint Thomas Aquinas. Already the court of Rome submitted questions of pure dogma to the theologians of the University ot Paris, while reserving to itself all questions of canonical law. But the college founded in so humble a manner by Robert de Sorbonne was soon to become the official organ of scholastic theology ; and in its bosom were discussed questions which embarrassed the Church ot France and even the court of Rome. From its walls went forth the sentences, decrees, and censures which were to have force of law throughout the Catholic world. themselves in order to obtain theological -uppurt for their projected usurpation.

The theses of the Sorbonne acquired particular celebrity, the \"Sorbonic thesis\" being regarded as the ideal of the theological essay. During the middle ages and even to the end of the seventeenth century the Sorbonne was the great theological authority ; but it had politics of its own which, viewed in the present day, do not seem to have been always in accord with its religious teaching. It took part with Etienne Marcel in the parliamentary and almost revolutionary movement which he directed in opposition to the party ofthe dauphin and of the aristocracy. It was a doctor of the Sorbonne, the Franciscan friar, Jean Petit, who wrote the \"apologia\" for the assassination of Louis of Orleans ; and another doctor of the same institution, Jean Larcher, who, with the deputies of the university, publicly accused the dauphin of the murder on the bridge of Montereau, where, on the ioth of May, 1410, the Duke of Burgundy, Jean Sans-Peur, was mated by men belonging to the dauphin's suite. To avenge this crime Philippe the Good, Jean's son, seconded by the King of England, took possession on the 20th of June, 1420, of Montereau, which remained in the power of the English until 1428. The Sorbonne, representing the Church, con demned Joan of Arc as a sorceress, com municated its judgment to the Duke of Bedford, and, in a petition addressed to the King ot England, demanded her extradition.

To form the nucleus of the institution forty-eight persons were named, a third of the whole number of members, the remaining two thirds to be nominated by the original members. The three men to whom, in particular, this pro ject wa- due, were Lakanal, Dainon, and Carnot. Unhappily France was at that time in the condition of a patient who i- just recovering from an attack of fever. Entire br. inches of human culture seemed to have disappeared ; the moral, political, and philosophical science- were at the lowest level. Literature scarcely existed. The historical and philological sciences counted scarcely more than one man of eminence, Sil vc-tre ile Sacy. On the other hand the 1 al and mathematical sciences were at one of their highest states of development. The division of the institute into classes and sections was affected by thi- condition of things. There wi ie originally three classes ; one answered pre cisely to the Academy of Sciences as it now exists, and contained nearly the same sections ; the second was called the class of moral and political science ; the third represented Litera ture and the Fine Arts. It embraced what is now known as the French Academy, the Academy of Fine Arts, and the greater part of the Academy of Inscriptions. The principal error of this division was that it took no count of his torical science. To tell the truth, the mistake was excusable, since the science in question had then scarcely come into existence in France. Historical science presupposes long traditions, together with a refined and, up to a certain point, aristocratic society.

Constituted into irresponsible senates the academies would often show then narrow, egotistical, and self-willed. Thi ernment, possessing means ol action superior to any the academies can possess, corrects at their unjust exclusiveness ; while the public, with the crown of glory it holds in its hand, can always console those who, in spite of everything, are kept out. Alone privileged to decide 111 in tellectual questions, the government would often be too much influenced by personal considera tions. But the academies bring it back to .1 healthy appreciation of the men themselves. while the control exercised by the public pre vents it from yielding everything to court favour or party interests. The public is often a hid judge ; it is incapable of appreciating certain scientific merits. The government and the academies can enable scientific men to dispense with public encouragement in order to pu those special studies which fifty persons 111 Europe follow and understand, while they at the same time do justice on the intriguers and charlatans who contrive so often to enlist the suffrages of the public and the favours ol journalists. Nowhere is the unity of power 1 dangerous than in intellectual matters. Intel lectual liberty results from contrary foi unable to absorb one another, and helping by their very rivalry the cause ot progress.\" This organisation lasted six years; to be subse quently modified by various regulations. In 1 8 1 6, immediately after the Restoration, a serious blow was struck at the Institute, whose revolutionary origin was not forgotten. The First Consul had suppressed the class of moral and political sciences, without depriving of their titles those who had belonged to these classes. The case was not the same in 1816, when twenty-two persons, with the painter David, the Bishop Gregoire, Monge, Carnot, Lakanel, and Sieves, were deprived of a title on which they themselves conferred honour. On the other hand seventeen persons received, by royal edict, a title which has no value except when it is conferred on a man of letter- or of science by the free suffrage of his peers. Under Louis XVIII. and Charles X. science was held as of no account, and the academy which represented historical studies wa- invaded by gentlemen of the chamber, who had neither literary nor scientific claims. The Duke of Berry, the Duke of Angouleme, everyone con nected with the royal family or with the court could be admitted to the honours of the Institute. M. Renan declares that there were candidates so degraded as to wish to become members of the Institute simply that they might wear an em broidered uniform and carry a sword. The Institute is composed ol five academies I. The French Academy, founded in 1635 by Richelieu, with forty members, of which mention will afterwards be made in a special article. II. The Academy of Inscriptions and lettres, founded in 1003 by Colbert, with forty titular members, ten free members, eight foreign associates, and fifty correspondents. III.

The Palace of the Institute, also known as the Palais Mazarin, is the ancient college founded in con formity with one of the clauses of Cardinal Mazarin's will, and constructed in 1663 on the site of various mansions, including the Hotel de Nesle, with its famous tower. The Institute possesses a choice, and at the same time copious, library, which is not absolutely free to the public, but to which admission can be obtained by pre senting the card of one of the members of the Institute.

The modern Balzac, the greatest novelist of France, if not the greatest novelist the world has seen, was never a mem ber of the Academy ; and M. Arsene Houssaye (who will scarcely be invited to become one of the forty \"Immortals\") has written a book called \"ddie Forty-first Chair,\" in which he shows that throughout the history of the Academy there has always been some writer of the first eminence for whom, if no other could have been offered to him, a forty-first chair should have been found. Voltaire (who in 1747 was elected to the twelfth chair) may be said to base anticipated Arsene Houssaye's view when iserved that the Academy was an assembly to which noblemen, prelates, eminent lawyers, men of the world, \"anel even writers\" were admitted. As a rule, men ot learning have more chance of being elected than men of talent. I'.nth, moreover, social position, ami conduct, count for much.

For this reason Alexandre Dumas the younger refused for many years, anel until his father's death, to join the Immortals, though he could have been elected long before had he chosen to put himself forward. Originally the French Academy would, on rare occasions, invite a distinguished writer to join its body, but in consequence ol some refusals (one of which came from H ranger ill the form of a song) it now elects no one who has not first of all asked to be received. ddie style of man peculiarly acceptable as a member of the Academy was well described b) M. 1 ruizot when one day the merits of a candidate were being discussed in his presence. \" I shall vote for him,\" said Guizot ; \"lor whatever may be saiel on the subject, he has the qualities of a true academician ; he has a good demeanour, he is very polite, he is decorated, and he has no opinions.

The bell which tolled in this once-celebrated edifice hangs to-day in the Lycee Corneille. For a number of centuries the Church i if Sainte- Genevieve seems to have had an uneventful history. Dulaure, however, in that strange book, \"Les Singularity Historiques,\" gives some remarkable details in regard to the life led and the actions performed by the clergy attached to Saint- Genevieve, and indeed by the French clergy general Iv. Under the reign of Louis VII., styled the Young, Pope Eugene III., says this writer, driven out of Rome, came in 114.5 to Paris, and a few days after his arrival wished to celebrate mass at the Church of Sainte-Genevieve. The canons to do him honour brought before the altar a large silk carpet, on which the Pope knelt to pray. After the mass the sovereign pontiff retired to the vestry, when his servants, lay and ecclesiastic, took possession of the carpet, claiming that it belonged to them simply because the Pope had made use of it. The servants of the canons being of a different opinion snatched the carpet from the hands of the Pope's servants. The carpet, dragged on one side and the other, gave way and was soon in pieces ; the accident caused insults on both sides followed by blows. The king, who had witnessed the tumult, went forward to stop it ; his authority, however, was powerless against the fury of the combatants, and in the confusion he himself was struck. Victory remained with the holders of the place \u2014 the attendants in the Church of Sainte-Gene vieve. The Pope's followers, with torn clothes anil bleeding tacts, went before their master, who complained to the king and begged him to punish the insult. Thereupon the Pope and the king resolved to change the constitution of the Sainte-Genevieve Monastery. ginally known as the College of Clermont, this institution became, in virtue of letters patent, I foundation in 1662, when it received the name of Louis the Great.

A beadle who had been mixed up with the princesses' intrigui condemned to the gibbet, and a monk who had played a still more active part in connection with them was tortured to death.

'Lhe period of religious and warlike fanaticism was also a period of licentiousness and perse cution. The Jews, at the chivalrous time of the Crusades, were particularly unhappy. Their faith, their wealth, their usurious practices, ex posed them at all times to persecution, and the Crusaders, before starting for the Holy Land, habitually massacred them. Kings drove them from the country, and then, on payment of large sums, allowed them to return. Dulaure (\" Singularity Historiques \") attributes simply to avarice the accusations, always justified by the fanaticism of the people, which rulers brought against them, and which were withdrawn on payment of money. In 120,0 a woman living at Paris had pawned some clothes for thirty sous to a Jew named Jonathan, and wishing to take them out for the Easter holidays without repaying the money ad vanced, was told, according to her sworn testi mony, that she might do so if she would bring to the Jew a piece ot the Holy Sacrament, which she did. Then the Jew thrust his penknife into the Host, from which blood flowed in abundance without in any way terrifying him. Then he tot dc a nail and hammered it into the Host ; threw it into the fire, when it hovered above the flames ; plunged it into a kettle of boiling water, which it reddened with its blood, receiving mean while no injury. These miracles did not frighten Jonathan. The son of this Jew, seeing Christians go to church, said to them, \"It is useless for you to pray to your God, my father has killed him.\" Then a woman who lived next door to Jonathan entered his house under pretext of getting a light, and took away the Host in the skirt of her dress ; after which she placed it in a wooden vessi I and carried it to the cure of Saint- Jean-en-Greve, to whom she narrated what she had seen. The Bishop of Paris had Jonathan arrested, tried to convert him, and as the Jew refused, burnt him alive. But to return to the Church of Sainte-Gem vieve, which, though by its site one ofthe very oldest in Paris, dates, by its structure, mill from the eighteenth century. In 1 7 54 Louis XV., finding himself seriously ill, vowed \" that if, through the intercession of Sainte-Genevieve, he recovered, he would raise to her honour a new and sumptuoul ten. pie.\" Restored to health he showed hil ready to keep his word.

For the pursuance of his undertaking, however, he required money, and the want of it more than once suspended or re tarded his operations. Until 1789 the building went on with exasperating slowness. Then, however, it received an unexpected impetus. .Mirabeau had just died.

On the 30th of May, 1791, Gossin, deputy for Bar-le-Duc, addressed the Tribune in an enthusiastic out burst thus : \" It was on the 30th of May that the honours of sepulture were refused to Voltaire, and it is on the same day that the national gratitude must acquit itself of its duty of reverence towards one who has prepared men for toleration and liberty.\" The procession which accompanied the relics of Voltaire on their conveyance to the Pantheon was_ imposing in the extreme. Representatives of numerous corporations and professions attended to do homage to his memory, and at one point in the cortege eight women dressed in white, and carrying a statue of Liberty which appeared to be pointing to a complete edition ot Voltaire's works, were borne along in a gilded car. Finally came the sarcophagus, drawn by twelve white horses. After halts innumerable the solemn procession drew up before the Pantheon to the flare of tore lie-. The name of Pantheon, sufficiently heathen in character, had not hitherto been applied to the church of Sainte-Genevieve ; but it appeared a few days later in a petition demanding the same honours for Rousseau, and signed by poets, artists, and scholars.

The Convention adopted his propos itions in a decree- which was not executed until after the fall of Robespierre, on the 22nd of September, 1704. The official programme of the ceremonies, still extant, is interesting enough. After having fixed the order and the route of the cortege the authors of the programme added : \" Idle procession will stop when it arrives on the Place of the Pantheon ; a tipstaff of the Conven tion will advance towards the door of entrance, and there will be read the decree which excludes from the Pantheon the relies of Mirabeau. Thereupon the body of Mirabeau shall be con veyed out of the precincts of the Pantheon, anel handed over to the commissary of police for that section. Then the body of Marat shall be placed in triumph on a platform elevated in the Pantheon .... All citizens assisting at this ceremony shall be unarmed.\" From the last injunction it is evident that the authorities feared the possibility of a riot. Everything, however, passed off quietly. d\"he body of Mirabeau v as laid in a corner of the cemetery of Saint-Etienne du-Mont. At length, on the ioth of October, 1704, the turn of Rousseau came. His body, borne by a deputation of the inhabitants of Ermonville, where he had breathed his last, was received at the Tuileries, where the future arch-chancellor pronounced over it an impressive speech. The remains of the philosopher, enclosed in an urn, were then conveyed to the Pantheon, escorted by the crowd and preceded by an orchestra playing various airs from his own \" Devin du Village.\" But the political tide was already on the turn. On the 1st of February, 17^5, the bust of Marat, placed in several of the theatres and caftjs, was hooted and overthrown. His remains, according to the Abbe de Montgaillard in his history of t he- Revolution, were snatched from the Pantheon, dragged through the streets by young men, and east amongst the refuse of the Rue Montmartre \u2014 \"a tabernacle,\" says the abbe, \"worthy of such a god.\" This account, however, is inaccurate ; it was only Marat's effigy which was thrown into the sewer, his relics were transported to Saint- Etienne-du-Mont. In the meantime the Pantheon, as a structure, was in a state of neglect. These installations of illustrious men within its walls had takenjjlaesj more or less hastily, and the work indeed from completion. Mercier, in his \"Picture of Paris,\" thus describes a visit which he paid to the Pantheon in 1705: \"I ventured on the staircases of the edifice, across ladders, la cement, hammers, long saws and movii ings. The least sound reverberated, th. movement seemed to announce the approaching fall of the dome, and for the moment I im.,. myself interred in the Pantheon without any pleading or contest. When I quitted the 1 I experienced the pleasure which is felt b\\ \u25a0 and warriors at the end of tempests and combats; that of discovering that I was alive.\" By the time the Pantheon had been put into a satis factory condition the Empire had come into existence, and Napoleon, who had just re-estab lished public worship, wished to present tin- Republican temple t<> the clergy, whilst main taining the purpose for which the Constituent Assembly had designed it. A decree, dated :oth of February, 1806, dedicated the Pantheon to public worship under the name ol Church of Sainte-Genevieve, and consecrated it as a sepulchre for citizens who, in the career of arms or in that ofthe administration or of letters, had rendered eminent services to their country. The remains of thirty-nine persons, not all of them trulj illustrious, were deposited in the Panth under the Empire ; but the fall of the Em brought about another change. Louis X\\ 111. suppressed the necropolis, and removed from the pediment the famous legend, \" Aux grands hommes, la patric reconnaissante.\" The last illustrious men admitted to the honours of the temple supposed to have been erected to them by a \"grateful country\" were Victor Hugo, the great Carnot, the deputy Baudin, killed on a barricade during the couf d'etat of 1851, General Marceau, and La Tout d'Auvergne, \" the first grenadier of France,\" whose name, by order of Napoleon, used to be pronounced at every roll-call of his n when this answer was solemnly given: \"Motl sur le champ de bataille.\" The large open space to which the Pantheon gives its name\u2014 Place du Pantheon\u2014 was the scene of terrible conflicts between thi and the insurgents during the Revolution of February, [848, and again during successful insurrection of June in the san when troops and national guards all took p against the workmen set free to starve or fight by the closing of the national workshops which for financial reasons, could no longer be carried 1-"], [497, ""], [498, "WELL IN THE COURTYARD, CLUNY MUSEUM. 15"], [499, "r Die PmthtOD.] THE SAINTE-GENEVIEVE LIBRARY 65 on and against the social democrats who placed themselves at their head.

In 1803, when the peace of Amiens was broken and war burst out afresh between France and England, the pupils of the Polytechnic School evinced their patriotism by paying into the state coffers a sum of 4,000 francs which thev had collected amongst themselves. Bonaparte, on his return from Italy, en deavoured to conciliate the affection of men of learning and of letters. At that period nothing but the lustre of power or the superiority of the mind could command admiration. Having had himself admitted to the Institute, the First Consul loved to join his academic title to the indication of his rank in the army. He often visited the Polytechnic School, and even assisted occasionally at some of the lessons. He enriched its library with a number of costlv works, and furnished its laboratories with all that they needed. During the four years (1801 to 1804) which preceded the turning of this school into a barrack the people of Paris had returned to a state of tranquillity. At the theatre, however, disturb ances frequently occurred in which Polytechnic students played a part. The reiterated com plaints of the Minister of the Interior and the arrest of several of the disorderly students caused great vexation to the school authorities, who remonstrated with the delinquents and imposed severe disciplinary punishments upon them, but to little purpose. The classes began to suffer, for the agitation of the pit penetrated into the school, and the time which should have been devoted to work was frequently taken up with eager conversations on this or that exciting topic. Bonaparte, who had just taken the title of emperor, was apprised of these unfortunate occurrences, and immediately decreed, on the 1 6th of July, 1804, a new organisation by which the pupils would be formed into a military body and put in barracks. General Lacuee, councillor of state, was appointed governor, and Gay de Vernon took second command. The new organisation included the union of the barrack ei 1 tl, school on one spot, and an obligation on The Convention had made a clean sweep of all the schools established in the days of the rchy. Ere long, however, it began to revive the scholastic institutions on a new plan. The Committee of Public Safety began by decreeing the formation of a \" Central School of Public Work-.\" Fourcroy was commissioned to present a detailed report on the new scheme ; and the propositions contained in it were unanimously adopted. The Palais Bourbon was chosen as the domicile of erudition ; and here a three years' . of study, involving nine hours' work a day, offered to aspirants. The youth of Paris of the provinces hastened in crowds to a very subject was taught by an eminent specialist.

In the time when Paris was a Gallo-Roman city there existed on the left bank of the Seine, opposite the island which was to be known as that of the City, a palace surrounded with immense gardens, whose green lawns sloped down even to the edge ofthe river. The Norman invaders laid a portion of it in ruins, and the edifice was by no means in good condition as a whole when, in 1218, Philip Augustus gave it to his chamberlain, hlciiri. Soon afterwards the old buildings and the gardens connected with them were broken up and apportioned, and towards the end of the eighteenth century the Bishop of Bayeux sold the remains of the Palace des Thermes to Pierre tie Chains, the Abbe of Cluny. The monks of this abbey had plenty of means ; and as they did not buy to sell again, they remained proprietors of the Palace of Julian up to the time of the Revolution. The ruins were then made over to private persons, who, without regard to the majesty of history, introduced houses and shops in the midst of the Roman remains. Louis, as a lettered monarch, endeavoured to save the ruins from these profanations of the infidels, and he seems even to have entertained the thought of turning the remains of the ancient edifice into a sort of museum, but he did not carry out his idea ; it was not until the reign of Louis Philippe that the town of Paris regained possession of the Palais ties Thermes. It ceded the relic to the State in 1843. After the lapse of so many centuries the astonishing thing is that one stone of the ancient Roman edifice should now remain. The part of the original edifice which Time has spared is that which enclosed the Hot Baths. The large hall, with its highly-imposing vaulted roof, was the Hall of the Cold Baths: the so-called Frigidarium. The place occupied by the fish-tank can still be recognised, and the remains may be seen of the canals which brought the water into the baths. Bricks and stones have been alternately employed in the walls, whose surface has been blackened by \"sluttish 'Lime,\" and impaired in all sort- of ways.

Eight crowns of massive gold, enriched with pearls and precious stones, were one day dug from the earth at Guarazzar in the neighbourhood of Toledo. They were followed soon afterwards by another crown, belonging evidently to the same hidden treasure. Until then it was scarcely suspected that the Visigoth kings knew what gold-work meant. One of the crowns, however, purchased for the Cluny Museum, bears the words : \" Reccesvinthus rex offeret.\" Recces vinthus reigned in Spain from 653 to 672. On a second crown may be read, in characters struck with the hammer, the name, not yet explained, ofSonnica. The other crowns bear no inscription.

But the one inscribed with the name of Reccesvinthus was used, it is held, at the coronation of that king by the Bishop of Toledo.

The supposition is entertained that at the time of the Arab invasion these precious offer ings of the Visigoth king were buried by the Christians.

In seeking to determine which of the numerous alleged specimens of this artist's work really belong to him, connoisseurs have been aided by Time, which, destroying the imitations, seems to have preserved the genuine ones alone.

Nevers, Rouen, Moustiers, and the various centres of French pottery, are worthily represented at the Hotel Cluny, either by isolated pieces or by groups, and even entire collections. The stained glass at the Hotel Cluny is for the most part of Swiss or of German origin. The enamels are of every country and every age. Nine enamelled plates of exceptionally large di mensions were painted by Pierre Courtoys in 1 5 5q for the Chateau de Madrid, in the Bois de Boulogne. The figures \u2014 the largest, perhaps, that were ever executed in enamel \u2014 represent Justice, Charity, Prudence, and six other mythological divinities, more astonishing than attractive. A remarkable triptych, or picture with shutters, whose painter is unknown, but which belonged to Catherine de Medicis, represents on the central panel the queen on her knees, in widow's dress, before a crucifix. Her initials, with those of Henry IL, adorn this curious relic. Close by are enamelled cups and plates by Pierre Remond, Nardon Penicaud, and Jean Courtoys, with many works, justly esteemed, by the great enameller Leonard Limousin, remarkable among these being a fine portrait of Eleonora of Austria, sister of Charles V. and Francis I. The piece of Florentine mosaic in the first hall of the museum ought not to pass unnoticed. It has been described by Vasari ; and the Virgin and Child which it represents are the genuine work of Ghirlandaio. Executed at Florence in 140.6, it was brought to France by Jean de Ganay, President of the Parliament of Paris. The works of this famous mosaist are now very rare. The one preserved at the Hotel Cluny is relatively in sound condition, and gives a good idea of the great mosaics which adorned the churches of Tuscany.

The Museum of Artillery\u2014 Its Origin and History\u2014 The Growth of its Collection of Armour and Weapons of all Kinds. THE Museum of Artillery, with its varied and admirably classified collection of arms, takes us back to prehistoric times, and after exhibiting rude martial implements of dim antiquity, brings us forward through successive ages of arms until it at length produces the very piece which is to day in the hands of the French soldier. The ..ngin of the Musee d'Artillerie may be traced to the reign of Louis XIV. The Due d'Humieres, Grand Master of Artillery, obtained of the great monarch permission to place, in one ofthe halls ofthe royal magazine at the Bastille, a collection of small models of artillery then in use. This collection, intended to serve for the instruction of young artillery officers, was exhibited in glass cases. every description of war implements, whether past or present ; nor did it exclude a collection of all the projects which had hitherto been pro posed to the State by inventors. This comprehensive scheme, executed with in telligence and activity, almost immediately gave the happy results which had been anticipated. Objects of all kinds, manufactured with great care in provincial establishments of artillery, arrived in shoals at Paris, and were united with the assemblage of ancient arms and armour which already existed in the royal magazine. This was a moment of growth and prosperity for the new institution. Very soon, however, its progress was to be checked, and its existence threatened by the grave events of 1 789. On the 14th of July the arsenal of the artillery was devastated, and its collections almost entirely destroyed. Gribeauval was spared the pain of witnessing the destruction of the work to which he had wished to attach his name. He died on the 7th of May, 1780, two months before the taking of the Bastille. The Due de Maine and the Comte d'Eu, who .led d'Humieres, did nothing towards the development of this happy idea, which was only resumed on the abolition of the post of Grand i in 175; by Lieutenant-General de Val- n ho succeeded the count as First Inspector- General. A certain number of ancient arms and of new models were transported to the Academy, and an inventory ofthe collections, which is still prepared. In 1788 the celebrated rai de Gribeauval, regarded by French writers as the creator of modern artillery, led de Vallieres as Inspector-General. It was by means of little models constructed beneath his eyes that Gribeauval had prosecuted ' studies, and it was his familiarity with models which enabled him to determine the precise form f the amis to be employed in his new system. The idea of these little models extended itself the- machines used in the artillery, as like- ancient arms of which specimens J been preserved. Generalising his idea, Gribeauval determined to apply it to the creation -tablishment, and his project was \u00ab due time realised.

The \"\"lie proposed by Gribeauval embraced Curiously enough, however, that same revolu tion which seemed to have finally wrecked the new museum gave it suddenly a second life, and afforded it an opportunity of wide and rapid development. From 1 79 1 to 1704 the national factories were inadequate to supply the wants of the army. The system of requisitions which was vigorously en forced brought into the arsenals considerable quantities of arms of all kinds, as well as armour. A commission named by the Ministry had to select therefrom what was serviceable, and to reject what was useless. Regnier, attached to the commission as \" Controller of Arms,\" conceived the happy notion of putting aside every object which seemed to him to po-sess particular interest, and which at the same time was of no practical use. The as sortment he thus made was placed temporarily in the Convent of the Feuillants. Here it was inspected by Petier, Minister ofV'ar.who, perceiv ing the future utility of such a collection, . au-. .1 it to be transferred to the Convent of the Dominicans of Saint Thomas Aquinas.

For this purpose the First Consul, passing through Si in 1804, ordered that the anils he saw at the Town Hall should be transported to Paris; and this time it was necessary to obey, though the carriage of the trophies was entrusted, un- fortunately, to rascals, who filched and mentioned Rolland had managed to save from the destruction of the Bastille, ddie whole was placed under the charge of the newly-tormed \" Committee of Artillery \" ; and thus in 170b the museum obtained its re-organisation.

The Central Committee resumed its sittings, and one of the first of these was devoted to the re organisation id\" the museum, the importance of whose contents had just been revealed by a hastily -prepared inventory.

After Cesar's conquest, the Gauls adopted rapidly enough the manners and the arms ot the Romans. At length, however, towards the end of the fifth century, the Franks appeared, and the Frankish invader brought with him his own sword and his own shield. The soldier among the Franks was buried sometimes in a sitting posture, more often stretched on his back. On the right of the sleeping warrior was his lance, with the point turned towards his head, and measuring about his own height ; turned towards his feet was his battle-axe ; on the left his sword \u2014 but this by exception, and only in the case of a chief. The Franks also carried small daggers with a single edge, knives, and scissors in their waist-bands. The smaller objects of equip ment have been found in the graves of Frankish warriors. The Frank was armed chiefly for attack ; his weapons of offence were numerous and formidable, while for the defensive he had nothing but his little shield, so small in com parison with the huge target-like arm of the four teenth and fifteenth centuries. The chiefs alone among the Franks wore helmets. The twelfth century is represented by two helmets placed beneath glass at the end of. the galleries ; they were both found in the Somme. In the thirteenth century the man of wa usually armed with a coat of mail, but hi a sort of hood in mail which he could throw back on his shoulders, of which an interesting specimen is to be seen at the museum. The fourteenth century saw a transformation of the coat of mail into a suit of armoin of polished steel, which, with some varial caused by the introduction of portable fire-arms, remained the ordinary armour ofthe man ol until the time of its final disappearance. Tov 1325 the transformation was complete, as is proved by a great number of monuments of the time, including sculptured figures on tombs, paintings, manuscripts, sepulchral figures engraved on plates of copper, &C. These monuments and documents show that the military costume and equipment of the fourteenth century varied more than is generally imagined. Everyman of war armed himself as he thought fit ; but then enough records to give an idea of the type that prevailed and even to guide the arch\u00e6ologi to the dates of particular changes. What caused the ancient coat of mail to be given up was its weight, and at the same time its incomplct for defensive purposes. It could stop the thrust of a sword and even of a lance, but in collision the effect of the shock was felt ; and in adopting leather jerkins, and afterwards steel plates, the object was to spread the effect of the shock over a greater surface. The period of Charlemagne has been much studied, but it is difficult even now to form any idea as to the arms the emperor and his soldiers carried. The sword of Charlemagne in theMuseum ot Soie-reigns and his spear are all, in the way ot armoury, that has been preserved. If, however, we compare the sword with that of Childeric, we see many points of difference ; the sword of Childeric, almost without a guard, and with a pommel of small dimensions, is very like a Roman sword. The large hemispheric pommel and the broad blade of the Emperor take us back to the medi\u00e6val types of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. As regards the successors of Charle magne, the guards of Charles the Bald wore a uniform which closely resembled that of the Romans, with helmets of barbaric form, of which the base was very nearly square. 'Lhe coat of mail was not abandoned, but it was worn shorter and of lighter make, without its former accessories, and thus greater lightness and greater facilities of movement were gained. The warrior towards the end ofthe thirteenth century was oppressed by his equipment, and did not get off his horse. After the transforma tion he was able to fight on foot, as he did in all the celebrated battles of the fourteenth century, beginning from Crecy ( 1346). Now for a century and a half there is a break in the history of French weapons until we come to the Bayeux Tapestry, some time after the conquest of England by William the Norman. This celebrated piece of embroidery enlightens us as to the arms, the costume, and the equipment of armies towards the end ofthe eleventh century: so different from everything of the kind under Charles the Bald. In the space of about two hundred years the arms and the equipment of the soldier had undergone a complete change. A -ingle sword is the only weapon of this epoch that the museum can offer ; it is exactly like After the adoption of steel armour the mat of mail was still for a time worn underneath; but as the steel armour became more solid the coat of mail was gradually abandoned. The mi contains the complete armour ol a nun and horse, which dates from the middi fifteenth century. Towards the end of that century the armour"], [521, "EARLY SPECIMENS OF ARTILLERY. 87 The Musee dArtillerie.) of the man of war had reached perfection. Every kind of shield had now been given up as useless ; plate armour furnished every necessary defence, for it was only when the armour was weak that anv additional protection was necessary. Thus the Norman coat of mail, as worn by William's invading army, presented in its species of trellis work enormous gaps, and for his complete defence the horseman protected himself with a long shield in the form of a heart, which in action covered the whole of his left side \u2014 the side he presented to the foe. As the armour becomes more effective the necessity for a shield diminishes, and, after getting smaller and smaller, it at last disappears. Artillery Museum contains a suit of armour by Turenne, which shows what plate armour had become at the end ofthe seventeenth century. It was abandoned altogether at the beginning of XIX'.'s reign ; the last helmets worn in France and England belonging to the time when this head-gear formed part of the armour of Cromwell's Iron-ides. including the chassepot, associated with the war of [870 and 1871, and the \" fusil Gras,\" which replaced it. The word artillery was formerly applied to every implement of war, though since the introduction of musketry it has been used only to designate guns of large calibre drawn by . as distinguished from portable fire-arms. Nevertheless, the first specimens of artillery, in something like the modern sense of the word, were of small bore, and the projectiles were the balls used in connection with the crossbow. The French employed artillery of this kind as far back as the battle of Crecy (134b). Gradually the bolts of the crossbow were replaced, for artillery fire, by leaden balls, called plummets (\" plom niees \"), of about three pounds' weight ; these were used in cannons of modern shape, and by degrees the size of the balls was increased until soon the artillery of an army was divided into light and heavy. The discoveries ofthe monk Berthold Schwartz belong to the middle of the fourteenth century ; and though this learned, but not perhaps bene ficent, inventor revolutionised the art of war, he cannot be accused, in pursuing his studies, of having had any deadly purpose in view. Among the innumerable specimens of arms ved in the Museum of Artillery, portable arms are classed apart from those which strike at a distance, the latter including spears, javelins, bows and arrows, cannon, and every kind of fire-arm. The bow was the arm of the English, the crossbow that of the French. With the former the archer could fire more quickly, and 1 to preserve the string from getting wet; of which the advantage was experienced on the English side during the battle of Crecy. The English retained the use of the bow after the French had abandoned that of the- crossbow ; and, according to the director of the Musee dArtillerie, English bowmen were in action as late as 1627, at the siege of He. Companies of archers disappeared the French army under Louis XII., about the year 1 514. The last time, however, that and arrow- were seen in European warfare of Eylau and Friedland, in 1806, to M.

The earlie.-t fire-arms were loaded at the breech by means of a box, which was received in a strong stirrup and fastened with a key ; and with the use of breech - loading pieces the history of artillery begins, and up to the present time ends. Soon after the introduction of artillery a rapid augmentation took place in the size of the guns employed, and cannon-balls of stone were used. These were replaced by smaller balls made of cast iron, but even to the present day the weight-carrying power of a gun is estimated on the supposition that the ball is of stone. Stone cannon-balls were used by the Turks long after they had been abandoned in European armies ; so also were pieces of immense calibre. In Western Europe cast-iron balls were found to be more effective than the larger balls of stone. The Artillery Museum contains specimens of every kind of cannon used, from the original breech-loader to the breech-loader of the present day.

The construction of the various pieces, as we follow them in chronological order, becomes simplified, then complicated, then simplified again. Gun - carriages and ammunition-chests vary in form, until we find tit last the field artil lery, under Napoleon III., of one pattern ; though two kinds of guns, light and heavy, are still used in the reserve artillery.

On the 21st of July in the following year the National Assembly voted an annual sum of 12,700 livres (i.e., francs) for the Deaf and Dumb School, which now, from the Convent of the Celestins, where Queen Marie Antoinette had established it, was transferred to the ancient seminary of Saint-Magloire, Rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques. almost to suburban parts, is the house, formerly a Benedictine monastery, where, until the Revolution, was preserved the body oi of England, who had died at Saint-Germain-en- Laye on the 16th September, 1 701, and of Louise Marie Stewart, his daughter, who died at the same place in 1727. We now approach the Val de Grace, that superb monument which Anne of Austria founded in 1 64 1 as a thank - offering for the birth of the dauphin, afterwards Louis XIV. who came into the world when his mother had been twenty-two years without giving birth child. The young king, now in his eighth laid the first stone of the Val de Grace on the 1st of April, 1045. Mansard, the royal architect, had drawn up the plan and begun the work, when serious difficulties presented themselves ; for the site of the church was just above the catacombs. To reach a foundation, it was necessary to make a number of deep pien besides supporting the new edifice with blocks ol solid masonry. One of Moliere's few sei poems is in honour of the Val de Grace and of its architect, who was numbered amongst his most intimate and most cherished friends. Alter .1 very short time, however, the direction of the works was taken from Mansard, and given to Jacques le Mercier. Finally, Pierre de Muet was entrusted with the difficult but honourable task ; nor did he finish the work without th. of two other architects, Gabriel le Due ami Duval. The Deaf and Dumb School was reconstructed in 1823 by the architect, M. Peyre, who left it as it now stands. It is looked upon as the perfect model of institutions of the kind. It contains, - the class-rooms, refectories, dormitories, and workshops, not to mention the rooms in which the sittings of the \" Central Society of Education and Assistance for the Deaf and Dumb \" are held. Almost opposite the entrance to the Deaf and Dumb Institute is the Rue des Ursulines, and just beyond, the Rue des Feuillantines, where Victor Hugo passed the happiest years of his childhood, to which reference is made in some of the finest verses of the Orientates. The Rue Saint-Jacques now joins the Rue d'Enfer, which separates it from the Boulevard Saint-Michel. The Rue d'Enfer owes its ominous name to a belief entertained in the eighteenth century that it was haunted by the fiend. Various plans for driving away the common enemy of man were suggested, until at last the bright idea occurred to someone of making over the entire street to an order of monks, who, it was thought, would be able, if anyone could, to deal with the invader from below. Either by some exorcising process, or by the natural dread which Satan or his emissary could not fail to experience at being brought beneath the observation of so many pious brethren, the Rue d'Enfer, from the time of its passing into the hands of the religious order, became one of the quietest thoroughfares in Paris. It still, however, in memory ol the old legend, preserves its ancient name.

The of the princes and princesses of the royal family were successively deposited in the different chapels of the church, the first being that of Ann Elizabeth, daughter of Louis XIV., who died in tender years ; the last that of Louis, Duke of Burgundy, who died March 27, 1761. Tl were thrown to the winds in 1 793, but not the reliquaries of gilded enamel in which they were enclosed. One alone was saved : the heart of the dauphin, son of Louis XVI. and of Antoinette, which was restored to the family and afterwards deposited at Saint- m 181 7. Two hearts are still deposited in the ancient vaults : that of an English woman i Mary Danby, of whom no record has 1 veil, and that of Larrey, the illustrious ni -in -chief to the Grand Army, whose statue in bronze, by David of Angers, adorns the ard of the Val de Grace. relics of saints, did not favour the respectful preservation of relics of any kind. Great was the astonishment caused in England when, in the last generation, it was found that Daniel O'Connell had by will ordered his heart to be sent to Rome. The injunction was made at the time the subject of an epigram which was intended to be offensive, but which would probably have been regarded by O'Connell him self as the reverse, setting forth, as it did, that the heart which was to be forwarded to Rome had never, in fact, been anywhere else. The reasons for which, in the Middle Ages, hearts were en closed in precious urns may have been very practical ones. Sometimes the owner of the heart had died far from home ; and, in accord ance with his last wishes, the organ associated with all his noblest emotions was sent across the seas to his living friends. Such may well have been the case when, after the death of St. Louis at Tunis, the heart of the pious king was trans mitted to France, where it was preserved for centuries, perhaps even until our own time, in the Sainte-Chapelle. In the year 170,8, while some masons were engaged in repairing the building, which had been converted into a dep6t for state archives, they came across a heart shaped casket in lead, containing what was described as \" the remains of a human heart.\" The custodians of the archives drew up a formal report on the discovery, and, enclosing it in the casket with the remains, replaced the whole beneath the flagstones under which they had been found. In 1843, when the chapel was restored, the leaden heart-shaped casket was found anew, and a commission was appointed to decide as to the genuineness of the remains believed to be those of St. Louis. An adverse decision was pronounced, the reasons for discrediting the legend on the subject being fully set forth by M. Letrenne, the secretary of the commission. last king of France and of Navarre died ie 6th of July, 1836, and it was not until nine days afterwards, on the 15th of July, that the fact was made known to the French public through the columns of the Gazette de France.

'Lhe difference was arranged by the archbishop and bishop taking off their pontifical garments and acknowledging the supremacy ..| the abbot in his own abbey. At the death of Charles VI. it was found necessary to consult the Duke of Bedford the conduct of the funeral ceremony, and, under the direction of the foreigner, it was performed with great magnificence. The duke obsen nearly as possible the ancient ceremonial, the only important variation being that (possibly in his character of Englishman) he ordered the interment to be followed by a grand dil Several disputes on the favourite subject of etiquette had already taken place, when at the dinner-table the presence of the Registrars of the Parliament was objected to by the king's sergeants-at-arms. The point, when referred to the Master of the House, was decided in favour of the registrars. The obsequies of the French kings have from the earliest times been attended with as much pomp and show as their coronations. It was not enough to embalm the body, place it in several coffins and finally carry it to the tomb ; it was necessary, before transporting it to the royal burial-place of Saint-Denis, to observe a ceremonial which the court functionaries and the officials of state made a point of following in the most literal manner. In the first place, the effigy of the dead king was exposed for forty days in the palace, stretched out on a state bed, clothed in royal garments \u2014 the crown on the nead, the sceptre in the right hand, and the brand of Justice in the left, with a crucifix, a vessel of holy water, and two golden censers at the foot of the bed. The officers of the palace continued their duties as usual, and even went so far as to serve the king's meals as though he were still living. The body was afterwards transported to the abbey of Saint-Denis, with the innumerable formalities laid down before hand ; while, at the moment of interment, so many honours were paid to it, that to enumer ate them would be to fill a small volume. So precisely was the ceremony regulated that battles of etiquette constantly took place among the exalted persons figuring in the ceremony. At the burial of Philip Augustus the Papal Legate and the Archbishop of Rheims disputed for precedence, and, as neither would give way, they performed service at the same time, in the same church, but at different altars. A like scandal occurred at the funeral of St. Louis. When his successor, Philip III., wished to enter the abbey of Saint-Denis at the head of the pro cession, the doors were closed in his face. The abbot objected to the presence, not of the king, his master, but of the Bishop of Paris and the Archhishop of Sens, whom he had observed These royal funerals cost naturally enormoui sums of money, which were charged partly to the crown, partly to the city of Paris. The obsequies of Francis I. cost his successor five hundred thousand livres, without counting the contribution \u2014 which was probably of equal amount \u2014 from the town. The effigies of his two sons who had died before him were carried with him to Saint-Denis. Thus there were three coffins in the procession. By the- ob servance of a similar custom, there were in the funeral procession of St. Louis no fewer than file. At the funerals of the old kings genuine grief was often exhibited by the people. Such, however, was not the case at the obsequies of Louis XIV. The Due de Saint-Simon, in his \"Memoin,\" speaks of this funeral as a very poor affair, remark able only for the confused style in which it was conducted. The king had left no directions in regard to his burial ; and, partly for the economy, partly to save trouble, it to regulate the ceremonies by those obsi the interment of Louis XIIL, wh... it. I had ordered that they should be as simple I pi issible. \" His modesty and humility, as well H other Christian and heroic qualities, had not, says Saint-Simon, \" descended to his son. But the funeral of Louis XIIL was accepted a- a pre cedent, and no one saw any harm in tli any other way objected to it, attachment and gratitude being virtues no longer to be found."], [529, "ROYAL FUNERALS. 95 Relics ofthe Great.) This was again shown by the absence of the Duke of Orleans, just appointed regent, on the ni of the heart being carried to the Grand Je>uits. When, a month later, the solemn obse quies ofthe king were celebrated at Saint-Denis, everything took place with such confusion, \"and so differently from what was observed at the funerals of Henry IV. and Louis XIIL,\" that Saint-Simon declines to narrate the scene. He cannot, however, help recording a quarrel on a point of etiquette, which took place between three dukes of the realm and Dreux, the Master of the Ceremonies. Possibly the question raised affected his own personal dignity as a duke. \"The Duk. 5 ol Uzi 5, of Luynes, and of Brissac,\" writes Saint-Simon, \" were appointed to carry the crown, the sceptre, and the brand of Justice, being the seniors of those competent for the duties. . . . When the ceremony had just begun Dreux approached the stall occupied by the Duke of Orleans to receive some order. Then went forward before the other princes and chief mourners, and said to Dreux that he i him to remember that the three dukes must be saluted before the Parliament. Dreux replied that he should do nothing of the kind. He was son of the Councillor of the Great Chamber, who had sent the king's testamentary -ition as regards the regency to the ibled Parliament. His son, then, was careful not to take part against the Parliament when the office held by his father was, prior to his the first cleanser of his low origin. M. content to ask him his reasons. ' Be- it would be against rule,' \" said Dreux. \"This liar replied insolently and falsely,\" adds >i, \" for his own registers, which are in my possession, show that the dukes were with out difficulty saluted before the Parliament at the of Louis XIIL, Henry IV., etc. Their dignity requires it ; the symbols of carried by them require it ; their seats, \u00bbed higher than those of the Parliament, prove 1 \u00bb' the most evident manner.

A number of persons had been arbitrarily im prisoned on lettres dc cachet and otherwise, some for Jansenism and various religious and political offences ; others for reasons known only to the king ; others, again, for reasons known to former ministers of the king, but to no one else. The regent ordered all the captives to be set at liberty, with the exception of a few whom he knew to be guilt)' of serious political or criminal misdeeds. Among the prisoners liberated from the Bastille was an Italian, who had been confined for thirty-five years, and who had been arrested the day of his arrival at Paris, which he had come to see simply as a traveller. \"No one ever knew why,\" says Saint-Simon, \" nor, like most of the others, had he ever been interrogated. It was thought to be a mistake. When his liberty was announced to him, he asked sadly of what use it was to him. He said that he had not a sou, that he knew no one at Paris, not even the name of a street nor a single person in any part of France, that his relations in Italy were probably dead, and that his property must have been divided among his heirs, considering how long he had been away from the country and that no one knew what had become of him. He asked to be allowed to remain at the Bastille for the rest of his life with board and lodging. This was granted to him, with liberty to go out when he pleased. As for the prisoners taken out of the dungeons, into which tbe hatred of the ministers and that of the Jesuits had thrown them, the horrible condition in which they appeared inspired dread, and rendered credible all the cruelties they related when they were in full liberty.\" The Story of the prisoner who declined to leave the Bastille is additionally interesting from its having been reported of another prisoner \u2014 possibly real, probably imaginary \u2014 on the occasion of the Bastille being taken by the Revolutionists in 1 780. The funeral of Louis XV. was a very hurried affair. The king died on the 10th of May at twenty minutes past three. The whole court instantly took flight, and there only remained with the body the persons necessary to take care of it. The utmost precipitation was used in removing it from Versailles. None of the usual formalities were observed. Everyone was afraid to go near the body. Undertakers, like the rest, feared the small-pox of which the king had died, and the corpse was carried to Saint-"], [530, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW.

The suggestions of the lieutenant, M. Leiioir, having been accepted, his successor, M. Crosne, appointed a commission through the members of the Royal Society of Medicine. which was entrusted with the duty of emptying the cemetery of the Innocents of its dangerous contents. The decision arrived at was that the human remains should be removed from the cemetery and placed in the quarries of Mont- Souris. During the year 1786 the quarries were prepared for receiving the bones of whole gen- erations of the Paris population. In sonic- places pillars were built up in order to support the quarries where there seemed to be a proba- bility of their giving way from above ; in others, where the quarries were open, thew were covered over, so that the new catacombs might be every- where underground. Excavations, too, had to be made ; and, finally, an upper storey was con- structed, so that the bones now repose in two different layers, one above the other. On the 7th of April, 17X7, the catacombs intended to serve as general ossuary to all the cemeteries ot Paris were solemnly blessed ami consecrated ; ami the same day began the translation of the contents of the cemetery ofthe Innocent- to the catacombs.

Marshal Ney, \"They must fight. I will myself take a gun from the hands of a grenadier. I will begin the action, and will shoot the first man who refuses to follow me.\" 'Lhe next day, on the 13th of March, Ney was informed that Bonaparte was being everywhere received with acclamation, and that everywhere the troops sent against him were joining his standard. At Bourg, Macon, and Dijon the re-establishment of the Empire had been proclaimed ; and the artillery, which had been ordered to join the Royalist tinny, had gone over to Napoleon's forces. In presence of this irresistible movement, the marshal fell into a state of the utmost perplexity. On the night of the 13th emissaries from Bonaparte came to see him. They declared that the return of Napoleon met with the approval of Eingland and Austria ; told him that his soldiers would cer tainly abandon him, and explained to him, by narrating the triumphal progress of his former chief, how impossible he would find it to act against the current of public opinion. All this had a great effect upon Ney. Uncertain, shaken in his resolution, he consulted the two principal generals, Lecourbe and Bour mont, serving under his orders, and, on the ground that the public current was irresistible, determined to abandon the Royalist cause. E'orgetting all his promises, all his emphatic protestations of loyalty, he joined the side that was now triumphant. He assembled his troops in the public square of Lons-le-Saunier on the morning ofthe 14th, anil appeared in the midst ofthem surrounded by his staff. Drawing his sword, and in a loud impressive voice, he read the following proclamation, which had been handed to him by Napoleon's envoys : \u2014 \" Officers, under-officers, and soldiers. The cause of the Bourbons is lost for ever. The dynasty adopted by the French nation is about to reascend the throne.

Finally, in 1658, the company formed by Moliere was allowed to give representations at the Louvre, in the hall of the Cariatides. The success of the new company was so great that the Duke of Orleans, brother of Louis XIV., gave them hospitality in the Palais Royal, where were represented till Moliere's masterpieces, and the first piece written by Racine, \" La Thebaitle.\" As long as Moliere lived his company Struggled victoriously against the Theatre du Marais and the comedians of the Hotel de Bourgogne, who, nevertheless, called themselves \" the great comedians.\" But in 1673 the death of the great comic poet proved fatal to his theatre. E'our of his most celebrated actors, Baron, La Thorilliere, and Monsieur and Madame Beauval, passed over to the enemy, while, to complete the discomfiture, the remainder of the company was expelled from the theatre in the Palais Royal, which the king now gave to Lulli the composer. The exiles took refuge in the Rue Mazarin, on the other side of the water, where they vegetated obscurely, though taking with them all Moliere's plays. Finally, in ibKo, by order of Louis XIV., the two principal companies were united under the name of Comedie Francaise. 'Lhe combined company established itself first in the theatre of the Palais Royal, then in the Rue Mazarin, where the Moliere company had previously been playing; then, in 1689, in the Rue des Fosses Saint-Germain des Pres, which took the name, first of Rue de la Comedie and after wards of Rue de l'Ancieiine Comedie, which it still preserves.

No ; I neither poisoned it nor caused it But the trial of Fieschi (the details of whose crime have been already related) brought to light in connection with the case no political circumstances of any kind. Against the theory generally ac cepted by French historians, that Fieschi, in preparing his diabolical outrage, was moved only by love of notoriety, must be placed the tact that he did not po-sess enough money to construct the \"infernal machine\" without assistance, and that he was supplied with funds by several workmen, who cannot themselves be supposed to have been burdened by any superfluity of cash, ami who, in their turn, must have been supplied from some quarter destined to remain unknown. It was not until a month afterwards that, through his avowals, some of Fieschi's accomplices were ill-covered ; and it was not till the February of the following year that the trial before the Chamber of Peers was brought to an end. After eleven appearances before the court on eleven different occasions, Fieschi and two of the direct participators in his crime were condemned to death. In the course of the evidence abundant par ticulars were furnished as to the life led by Fieschi since his earliest days. He had served in the Neapolitan army under Murat, whom, after the general collapse of the Napoleonic system, he seems to have betrayed to the Austrian-. He had been imprisoned for various offences, and when at liberty had acted, in Italy and in France, a- informer and spy. He had at la-t succeeded in obtaining a very small post under the Administration as keeper of some kind of mill ; and as he was dismissed from this appointment only a few months before his attempt on the lite of the king (a warrant being at the same time issued for his arrest), it is barely possible that in preparing his crime he was moved by some idea of personal vengeance act ing upon a disordered brain. Endeavours were made to obtain a commuta tion of the capital sentence on behalf of Fieschi's accomplices ; to which the Duke of Orleans, Louis Philippe's eldest son, replied : \" If I myself, or any member of the king's family, had been struck, it might have been possible to grant the commutation demanded ; but no relation of any of the victims has suggested it.\" Fieschi and of his accomplices were accordingly exe cuted, without either of them saying the least word as to the origin ofthe foul conspiracy.

Colonel Parquin had gone mi shi buy some cigars, when, on his way back from the tobacconist's, he saw a boy seated on a li wood feeding an eagle with shreds ot meat. Thi eagle had a chain fastened to one of its claws, with which it. was secured. ddie colonel asked whether the bird was for sale, and it was ulti mately purchased for a pound. Com eyed on board, the eagle was fastened to the mainmast, and from that moment was never taken notice ol until it was discovered and sei/ed by the autho rities at Boulogne. The eagle was for many years afterwards on view at the Boulogne slant. house, where there were abundant opportun supplying it with raw meat, ddie unhappy bird was destined, however, from first to last, to bi made the subject of fables. Even Count ' account of its adventures at Boulogne is in - e particulars incorrect. He had been informed that after the capture of Prince Napoleon and his followers the eagle was taken to thi museum, whence, he says, it fled morning, owing to some carelessness on the part of the men who had it in charge. It was, as a matter of fact, however, taken to the abattoir, where the present writer remembers seeil some half-dozen years after Prince Napoli landing. After vainly waiting at Gi hours after the time at which the princi due, Count Orsi took a post-chai tened to Ramsgate, where General Montholon, Colonel Voisin, and Gdonel Laborde had been sent on by the prince in anticipation of his arrival. Colone Voisin was the only one of the threewho under- to his account, encouraged in hi- hazardous project by Lord Palmerston ; not because that statesman believed in its success, but because he knew that it must inconvenience ami possibly injure Louis Philippe, whose policy he detested. Louis Blanc also holds, in connection with the Boulogne expedition, that the French embassy in London was kept well informed as to the pro gress ofthe enterprise, but did not interfere be cause, anticipating with confidence a complete failure, it looked upon this fiasco as destined to have a strengthening effect on the existing Government, certain at once to suppress it. However all this may have been, Louis Napo leon's friends engaged for him, in the month of July, 1840, a steamer named the Edinburgh Castle. On the 4th of August the arms, ammu nition, and baggage were1 taken on board tit Gravesend, where the vessel remained for some little time. Here it was that the famous eagle, which has become the subject of a ridicu lous legend, was brought on board. An officer of the party who had gone on shore happened to meet with a youth who was offering an eagle tor sale. Struck by the appropriateness of the bird, he determined, more in a jocular than in ti superstitious spirit, to purchase it and place the expedition under its auspices. It was after wards pretended that the eagle had been trained in London to fly round the head of Prince Louis Napoleon; this gyration, according to Louis Blanc, being caused by the bird'- know ledge that a piece of bacon was secreted beneath the rim of his master's hat. Louis Blanc, in his \" Histoire tie Dix Ans,\" give- a long account of the Boulogne expedition, which is in the main correct. Several in accuracies, however, have crept into his narra tive, so often one-sided ; and the only authentic account of this invasion on a small scale that has been written by a participator in the events is the one published for the first time some dozen years ago by Count Orsi. In asking the count to join him in the expedition, Prince Napoleon declared that if he ever succeeded in placing himself on the throne of France, which, sooner or later, he was convinced lie shi mid do, one of his first cares would be to free Italy from the domination of Austria, and unite the different Italian states into one inde pendent kingdom. Apart, however, from this assurance, Count Orsi was quite prepared to throw in hi- lot with that of the Prince.

Next time the boat brought Colonel Voisin and 11111, men on shore. Then the Prince, General Montholon, Count Persigny, and a few 0 landed. At five o'clock the whole party were within fifty yards of the barracks. At the sight of this armed force the sentinel shouted, \" Who goes there?\" and \"To arms!\" One ot tin prince's men, who had been in the army, was sent ahead with the watchword \u2014 which he mil knew. On his pronouncing it, the gate oi tin barracks was thrown open, and the pri followed by his supporters, entered the yard. These words produced an indescribable out burst of enthusiasm, mingled with expressions ot the most touching devotion. All sprang from their seats. For a few moments the prince was too much overpowered with emotion to vent his gratitude in words. Then he said : \" Friends, I thank you for the alacrity and high spirit with which you have responded to my call. I never doubted your willingness to aid me in my pro jects, but the devotion you have just displayed has lent a new vigour to my mind and has bound my heart to you with a sense of deep, of eternal grati tude.

We shall have obstacles to grapple with and obloquy to face ; but the hour will come, and we shall not have long to wait for it.\" It was now nearly three o'clock on the morn ing of the 5th. 'Lhe moment had arrived for a prompt decision as to the wisest method of pro ceeding. It was arranged that Forestier, the cousin of Count Persigny, should go at once to Boulogne, for the purpose of informing Lieu tenant Aladenize of what had happened, and to prepare everything, as far as possible, for the following day. A boat, manned by two men, was with difficulty hired : Forestier stepped into it, and, crossing the Channel, reached Boulogne at eleven that same morning. 'Lhe soldiers composing the garrison were just getting out of bed. Those few who were all downstairs soon learnt who the visit. .1 rushed up to tell their comrades that the pi whose name was so familiar to them, wait their thre-hold.

At 5.0 a.m. Count Orsi ordered the captain to put to sea, and the Edinburgh Castle was thenceforward kept well away from the land and from observation.

Then the National Guard opened a brisker fire. Galvani and Voisin were wounded, the former in the right hip, while the latter had the elbow of his left arm entirely shattered, ddie boat had now in the confusion got capsized, and the prince and his friends disappeared under her. As she lay keel upwards there was a terrible rge of musketry, which cut open the bottom of the boat and fractured the keel into matchwood. Had not the prince and his friends been at that instant immersed, they must have perished. For some time the prince and Count Persigny remained under water, and Count Orsi began to apprehend that they might be drowning, when both appeared at a good distance from the shore swimming towards the Edinburgh Castle. The National Guard now pointed all their muskets at the prince, but by some miraculous accident failed to hit him.

One morning the prisoners were all, with the exception of the prince, brought together in a room, where Captain Crow and his first mate were requested to look at every one of them, and see if they could distinguish the man who had given orders for the steamer to anchor off Wimereux. Both pointed to Count Orsi. As soon as the preliminary judicial formalities had been gone through at Boulogne the prince was conveyed to Paris, to be arraigned with his associates before the Court of Peers on a charge of having engaged in an expedition whose object was to overthrow the- existing Govern ment.

The second comprises those who, for a payment averaging from six or seven francs a fortnight, purchase the right not to labour. To the third belong till the prisoners who arc obliged to work in the shops directed by the speculator who farms the prison. These last receive but a third part of the wages paid by the speculator. Of the two other thirds, one goes to the administration, the other to the prisoner the day he is set at liberty. A prison-workman gains on the average two francs twenty-five centimes a month, of which he receives, as his own particular share, five centimes or one sou per day, which he is allowed to spend in the prison canteen. In France, as in England, different views are entertained on the subject of prison - labour. The prisoners must work ; and it is both waste ful and cruel to employ them without advantage to themselves or anyone else \u2014 as, for instance, in drawing water and then throwing it away. If, however, they are employed, like the occu pants ot Sainte-Pelagie and other French prisons, with useful work they are brought into compe tition with the honest workman outside. The political prisoners, and the prisoners who are allowed to liberate themselves from work by small payments, are permitted to order from the outside, by the intermediary of commissionaires attached to the prison for that purpose, what ever food and drink they may require. \" Luxu ries,\" it is true, are not permitted by the prison regulations, but it rests with the officials to determine what a \" luxury\" really means. Prisoners at this, as at some of the other Paris prisons, are allowed to send out letters, but copies of them are made and kept in the governor's office. By this system not only the prisoner but France and the whole world has, in some cases, profited. It was through copies being made of the eloquent and passionate, if not too edifying, epistles addressed by Mirabeau, during hi- confinement in the Bastille, to the young woman he was so desperately in love with that the now famous \" Let ties a Sophie\" were preserved.

Saint-Lazare, a house of detention and cor rection for women, is situated in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis. Before arriving at its ultimate destination, this prison had to pass through sundry historical phases, some of them sufficiently curious. It was at first, as its name indicate , a leper hospital ; and already at the beginning of the twelfth century it existetl on the road from Paris to Saint-Denis, built, as it had been, upon the ruins of an old basilica dedicated to Saint-Lawrence. Louis le Gros established for its benefit the fair of Saint-Ladre, which was held annually in front of the hospital and lastetl eight days. This fair was, under Philip Augustus, replaced by the fair of Saint- Lawrence. Like most lazarettos, the hospital of Saint- Lazare was composed of an assemblage of little compartments, in which each leper lived isolated. It is recorded by a monk of Saint-Denis, Odeon de Deuil by name, that in 1 147 Louis VII., carrying the royal standard to Saint-Denis pre viously to his departure for the Crusades, visit eel the lepers in their cells. The bakers of France, who, it appears, were more exposed to leproS) than any other body of men, owing to the action of the fire upon their skin, made it their par ticular concern to contribute towards the main tenance of Saint-Lazare, and sent large gifts of bread to it. In return, its doors were always open to any baker attacked with the malady. From 1515 until the seventeenth century Saint-Lazare was managed, or mismanaged, by the canons of Saint-Victor, who established themselves there as in a great abbey, and con sumed the rich revenues of the institution. The leprosy was turned out of doors, or at least the canons would only receive certain ecclesiastics afflicted with leprosy. In 1630 the reform of this degenerate establishment was confided to Saint-Vincent de Paul, who installed there, under the name of \" congregation of Saint- Lazare,\" a regular staff of priests to tend the sick.

According to one article of the prison regu lations, a footbath must be furnished to each prisoner at least once in two months, and a large bath at least twice a year. It is to be hoped that the officials of the different prisons do not really limit those under their charge to such an atrociously infrequent application of necessary water. The infirmaries are very competently organised. id imposing such rigorous de privations as would border upon in humanity, whilst equally avoiding such a dietary system as would lend an attraction to the prisons, and cause destitute wretches to prefer confinement ir ordinary life of liberty. The regulation diet is at present as follows : \u2014 a daily ration of bread weighing 750 gTammes for men and 050 for women ; in the morning, on ordinary days, a bowl of vegetable soup with bread in it, and on , Thursdays, and 1 iwl of meat soup ; in the evening similar soup, accompanied, , by a small quantity of dry vegetables, such as potatoes, peas, and lentils, and on Sundays anel fete hy a portion of meat, without bone, weighing at least 75 grammes, as i decilitres of potatoes.

The rest of the prison is only heated when the weather is very rigorous. The total number of patients admitted to the infirmary in 1869 was 12,982 men and 2,489 women. These figures may at first appear somewhat for midable ; but two facts must be borne in mind : first, that a stay in the infirmary is much coveted by prisoners, who get themselves entered on the sick list under the slightest pretext ; secondly, that the population of the Paris prisons is generally an unhealthy one, already degenerated through excesses or anterior maladies. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that long iso lation, insufficient exercise, and perhaps also inadequate food, produce a grievous effect on the"], [584, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW. ! lie I'n-ons ol Paris. 146 health of the inmates. It is found, indeed, that present each prisoner ha- a peculium, or at all events it is within his power to . 1 \u2022pjj, slender proceeds ot his labour form an accumu lation for this fund. The longer hi- imprison ment and the greater the difficulty experi in obtaining work on his discharge, the larger should be the stock of money intended to keep his hands out of other people's pockets. As a matter of fact, however, in the case of ill-regu lated prisoners, nine-tenths of the fund i times deducted before they tue liberated. In voluntary thieves are thus let loose upon society. prisoners who have been long confined are pe culiarly liable to become invalided ; and this is in particular the case with women. In 1869, out ofa given number of convicts, nearly three times as many were in the infirmary during the fourth year of confinement as during the first. That most patients, however, enter tbe infirmary in consequence of anterior conditions, is shown by the statistics for 1869, considerably more than half having been afflicted with previous maladies or bad constitutions. The hours of compulsory prison labour are regulated by the State. The organisation of the labour system leaves, on one point at least, something to be desired. A double object ought to be held in view by the authorities, namely, to ensure for the prisoner sufficient resources to exempt him, on his liberation, from tempta tion to mendicancy or theft, and to develop in him such habits of industry as will procure him an honest livelihood out in the world. The institution of the \" peculium,\" or private fund, is of the first necessity for this purpose.

During the first years of its existence the garden met with much opposition, and sometimes fell into a state of neglect. The Faculty of Medicine was jealous of this rival, and rebelled against the royal edict because de la Brosse did not seek to enlist the sympathies of its pro fessors. For this exhibition of disrespect the Faculty suffered no punishment but that of having its remonstrances quite ignored ; and Guy de la Brosse devoted all his energies to the enrichment of the botanical collection. His death, however, occurred three years after the inauguration, and his successors, as indolent as he had been indefatigable, let the garden run almost to weed. At length one of the professors of the Faculty imparted to it a new life. This was Fagon, one of Louis XIV.'s physician-, who seemed fitted for the task no less by his birth than by his studies ; for he was a grand nephew of Guy de la Brosse, and had first seen the light within the precincts of the Jardin tics Plantes. is enough, including as they do those us Buffon, Cuvier, and other writers whose lustre allied only by juxtaposition with those of the two greatest naturalists who ever lived.

In 1693 Louis XIV. conferred upon him the title of Superintendent. Fagon's period of service was indeed a pro sperous one for the royal garden. With a generous nature, and gifted with that savoir-faire which is only acquired by contact with men, he was happy in the choice of his professors, and contrived, by his influence and liberality, to give a great im pulse to the whole establishment.

The collection, moreover, was in creased by the activity and success of the French troop-, with a view to the greater glory of France, ami especially of Paris. ddie com manders of the French armies brought back with them, in the form of booty, the most interesting objects from the museums of the conquered cities. Holland having been overrun in 1798, a number of the curiosities belonging to the Staeltholder's Museum were forwarded to Paris; and the celebrated naturalist, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, was sent to Lisbon, occupied at the time by a French army, to choose from the local col lections whatever he might find suitable lor the natural history museum at Paris. After a time the collection became too rich for the professors and officials who had to arrange it. Money and space were alike wanting ; anel at last the established authorities form. illy complained that the treasures forwarded to them by the victorious troops were too abundant. Among the most celebrated professors at tached to the museum of natural history may be mentioned Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, already named, Lamarck, Lacepede, and Cuvier. ddie garden of the museum forms a spacious quadrilateral, bounded on the east by the Quai Saint-Bernard, on the north by the Rue Cuvier, on the south by the Rue Buffon, and on the west by the Rue Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Entering by the principal gate, the visitor finds himself opposite an immense- flower-bed enclosed between two long avenues which were planted by Buffon himself, ddie avenue on the left lea ls to the school of stone-fruit trees, the collections of botany, mineralogy, and geo- . the library, and the house inhabited by Buffon when he was superintendent of the place. The avenue on the right is bounded by the school of botany and the hothouses. Behind Higher up, in an almost forgotten CO the midst of foliage', stands a column suppi by a pedestal of minerals. Thi- simple n ment is in memory of a simple man. Beneath it rests the body of Daubenton, the friend aud collaborator of Buffon, the \"learned shepherd\" to whom France owes its fine breeds ol merino sheep, and the author of the new plan ol organisation adopted by the Convention in Narrow, winding paths, overshadowed by yen trees, lead to the Belvedere, constructed during the reign of Louis XV. 'Lhe bronze cupola ol doubtful style, surmounted by a celestial e with a sundial and a motto, tells plainly the period to which this fantastic conceit belongs, The motto, however, is ingenious and charming: \" Iloras non numero nisi Serenas\"; in English, \"I note only the hours of sunshine.\" Buffon had here placed an apparatus which ba- disap peared.

In the eleventh room will be found the collection of Dr. Gall, includ ing the ver\\ heads on whose developments he formed his theory of localised faculties and cerebral bumps. It may here be observed that the followers of Gall have rendered his system que-tionable by giving to it in detail a value which he attached to it only in ti general way. The collection contains, moreover, the bust of Dr. Gall himself, a cast of his head taken after death, and his very cranium, on which may be sought the special bump of phrenologism. Here, too, may be seen the masks of Voltaire, Casimir Perier, Francois Arago, and Jean Jacques Rousseau. This la-t was taken by the sculptor Houdon, at Les Charmettes, July 4, 1778\u2014 the day after Ron\u2014 em's death. A bust of Cuvier is to be seen on the ground floor, to which a staircase lead- directly from the Gall collection. It is the work of David d'Angers, and stands in front of ti\\. skeletons of elephants, which seem to form for the great comparative anatomist a guard of honour. In the anthropological gallery, on the first Boor, the visitor finds himself on entering in front ofa pleasing collection of human heads, all severed during lifetime from the bodies to which they belonged : those of Arabs and Kabyles, de capitated by the yataghan, and dried beneath the African sun.

The peasants, how ever, under the system of \" la petite culture \" produce more butter and their fowls more eggs than they need for their own consumption or for sale in France. Accordingly great quantities of eggs and butter are sent to England, France's best customer for produce of this kind. of goods. Each pavilion has its speciality. One is a wholesale, another a retail meat-market, a third is devoted to fish, a fourth to eggs and butter, and so on. Markets are held in various parts of the city ; but most of them are fed by the Central Market. of them recall the Central Market by the light character of the architecture in brick and iron. Two great cattle-markets are established at Sceaux and at Poissy, and a smaller one at La Chapelle Saint-Denis, connected with the Marchc de la Villette, built with the view of absorbing all the smaller meat-markets. The small proprietors, too, keep rabbits and pigeons, many of which find their way not only to the Paris markets but to England. A century ago, until the time of the Revolution, the land holding aristocracy had alone the right of shoot ing rabbits and keeping pigeons. \"The birds,\" says M. Nottelle, writing on this subject, \" ate the seed of the poor peasants in the neighbourhood and the rabbits ate the corn when it was green. These exclusive privileges were abolished on the celebrated night of the 4th of August, 1789.\" Yet it should always be remembered that the noble proprietors gave up their exclusive privi leges \u2014 doubtless under the influence of the Re volution, but, nevertheless, as a matter of fact \u2014of their own accord. Now everyone can keep pigeons; but the owners are ordered by the mayor to keep them in the pigeon-house during seed-time. If they are allowed to fly at this period they are considered as game, and may be shot. The owner, moreover, is fined. Occa sionally in the French market frogs are to be seen, and it is quite possible that in the days before the Revolution the epithet \" frog-eating \" could be more fitly applied to the generality of Frenchmen than it can now, when the thighs of frogs are only to be met with at certain restaurants, where they are served, equally with snails, as a rare delicacy. Unlike England, France, in the matter of agricultural products, is self-sufficing. Two thirds of the population are occupied, as pro prietors, farmers, or labourers, with the cultiva tion of the soil. In England the agricultural represent only one-third of the population. In France there are nine millions of small land owners with a slight proportion of large ones ; in England the land is in the possession of com paratively few persons. Up to the time of the ition the number of proprietors in France did not go beyond 30,000, and the peasantry at that period were in a state of utter poverty, the actual cultivators receiving, according to Alison, a twelfth part of the produce for their \" The people's habitations,\" wrote Arthur Young, \" are miserable heaps of dirt \u2014 no glass, 110 air ; the women and children are in rags \u2014 no kings.

Arthur Young's descriptions of them have been quoted often enough. A century earlier than Arthur Young, La Bruyere, author of \" Les Caracteres,\" spoke of them as looking like ferocious animals. \"The men and women,\" he continued, \"are meagre, dark-looking objects, their dirty rags scarcely covering them, and retiring at night into filthy dens or hovels.\" It is possible, then, as M. Nottelle, in his unpretentious but interesting and instructive little book on the French peasantry since the Revolution, declares, that several millions of peasants were obliged to live on root-. \"No doubt,\" he adds, \"they ate though it took much time to get a decent dish of them.

The cow, it is true, becomes in the poet's lines an ox ; but cows, like oxen, in France for the plough. \" I love ,my wife,\" exclaims those by whom the Paris markets are supplied. Not only is the French peasant prudent and economical : he is also, as is shown by the story just told, very cunning. Equally so is the peasant woman.

It seems strange and somewhat absurd to English Conservatives that so many peasants in France should have a vote ; but inasmuch as of these peasants nine millions are proprietors, the establishment of universal suffrage in France was not a revolutionary but a Conservative measure.

A narrow canal was at the same time dug, which placed the ditches of the fortified abbey in communication with the Seine. This canal, called at the time \" the little Seine,\" was filled up towards the middle of the sixteenth century, when the line of land thus formed became the Rue des I Augustins, now Rue Bonaparte. IF the Pantheon and the Luxemburg are by their size, their appurtenances, and their dominant position, the most important buildings on the left bank of the Seine, the most interesting, by its antiquity, is the church, with the monastery attached to it, of Saint-Germain-des-Pres ; which, like the cathedral-church of Notre Dame in the city, and the church of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois on the right bank, belong to the most ancient period of the Merovingian mon archy, to that, in other words, of Childebert I. and LTltrogothe his wife, who reigned at Paris from 511 to 538. Childebert, returning from an expedition against the Visgoths, brought back from Spain as trophies of his victory the tunic ot Saint Vincent, a gold cross and precious stones, together with some vases which were said to have belonged to King Solomon. By the advice of Saint Germain, Bishop of Paris, he constructed for the reception of the holy relics a church and a monastery at the western end of the gardens belonging to the Palace of the Hot Baths, or Palais des Thermes. On the very day of Childebert's death, in 558, Saint Ger main consecrated the new church as \" Church of the Holy Cross and of St. Vincent \" ; and he was himself buried in it when he died in 596. After the death of the good bishop the church which he had dedicated to the Holy Cross and to St. Vincent got to be known under im other name than that of Saint-Germain ; and it now became the burial-place of the kings, queens, and princes ofthe .Merovingian dynasty. Of this ancient church, three times burned by the Normans and three times rebuilt, but little now remains. Thirty years ago fragments ofthe walls and two of the gates were still to be seen.

By order of the restored Louis XVIIL, in April, 1816, the School of Fine Arts, with which no progress had been made under Napoleon, was to be completed. Then, however, it occurred to the king that it would be unbecoming to turn out from what had been considered their last resting-place so many statues, busts, tombs, and other monuments. Churches were now requested to claim the orna ments of which, under the Revolution, they had been despoiled, the different communes to take back the arms and other insignia which had been torn by fanatical revolutionists from their walls, while the great historic families were assured that they were now at liberty to resume possession of their ancestral sepulchres. But these permissions and appeals were for the most part in vain. Meanwhile the mausoleums of the kings and princes of France were removed to Saint-Denis, while many other monuments were placed in the museums of Paris and Versailles. It was now possible to proceed with the School of Fine Arts, and the first stone of the building was laid on the 3rd of May, 1820. The original plan, drawn up by the architect Debret, was much amplified, under the reign of Louis Philippe, by M. Dauban, who finished it in 1838 \u2014 at least in its essential parts. New buildings were added under the Second Empire between the years 1860 and i.Sb2. The National Special School of Fine Arts (such is its official title) furnishes instruction in drawing, painting, sculpture, architecture, and every kind of en graving to French students aged not less than fifteen nor more than thirty, and even to foreigners who have obtained due authorisation from the Ministry of Fine Arts. The School of Fine Arts occupies a palace worthy of the institution. Its general plan is simple in the extreme. Through the gate of its entrance, adorned with two colossal busts of Puget and of Poussin, may be seen a square courtyard whose walls are covered with admirable monuments, for the most part from the above mentioned Mti-ee des .Monuments Fran^ais. ddiis courtyard is separated from the principal one into which it leads by a sort of triumphal arch, elating from the year 1500. It was brought from the Chateau de Gaillon and reconstructed stone by stone. At the end of the principal courtyard is the grand facade, elue to M. Dauban, Louis Racine, author of that much-esteemed poem, \"La Religion.\" It was here, too, that the immortal author of \" Phedre \" expired on the -ist of April, 1699. Other theatrical associations are connected with this house. Here moreover, Adrienne Lecouvreur, the celebrated actress, died on the 20th of March, 1730, and, the last rites of the Church being as carried away the same night in a hackney-coach by Voltaire and a friend of Marshal Save who had always been devoted to l\u201e.r- .uried on the banks of the Seine at a point beyond the Palais Bourbon, which it is no longer possible to discover.

Every book, moreover, had now lo pass beneath the inspection of the Provost ol Paris. This edict sorely lettered the two dozen printers who were then at work in the capital. In 1522 the famous Robert Etienne, whom we call Stephens, published a beautiful edition. New Testament in Latin ; but the Sorbonne,dis pleased at the production of an edition which tended to popularise the Scriptures, attacked tin text of Etienne, though without any apparent desire to engage in direct controversy on the point. It does not appear that the work was suppressed ; but ten years later the Sorbonne showed itself much more potent in dealing with a new edition ot the Latin Bible published by Robert Eiienu ami successor ofthe before-mentioned, with annota tions- borrowed from the most learned authorities \u2014on the original Hebrew. The younger Etienne hail published this edition by special privilege ob tained from the king. To secure it against criti cism he had not printed it till after a careful comparison of the ancient manuscripts of Saint (lermain-des-Pres and the abbey of Saint-1 1 he had not even omitted to call in the most famous theologians to assist him. Yet, despite all his precautions, he could not avert the wrath ofthe Sorbonne ; and he was obliged to humiliate himself before that body and pro to print nothing henceforth \"nisi cum eorum gratia.\" These submissions saved Etienne, but could not obviate the danger which threat ened the art of printing. The era of persecu tion had begun. The Sorbonne, which had at first patronised the art of Gutenberg, w terrified now at the rapid propagation ot Luther s doctrines that it addressed to Francis I. an urgent request on the subject of heretical b representing strongly to the king that it he wished to save religion, attacked and shaken on all sides, he must, by a stern edict, permanently abolish in France the art of printing, which daily produced so many pernicious books.

It was introduced into the French capital by Allemand La Pierre, prior of the Sorbonne, one .if the greatest scholars of his time, and Guillaume Fichet, doctor in theology, who, in 1470, invited Ulrich Gering of Con stance, Michel Friburger of Colmar, and Martin Krantz, to come and establish a printing-office within the Sorbonne walls. 'Lhe three associates acceded to the request, and with the machines they fitted up printed a succession of interesting volumes during their stay at the Sorbonne, which lasted till 1473. Then their establishment was transferred to the Rue Saint-Jacques, under the sign of the \"Golden Sun,\" beside the church of Saint- Benoit. Here a number of elegant works were produced. In 1 484 Friburger and Krantz retired from the concern, in order probably to return to Germany, the name of Gering alone being appended to publications posterior to the month of October in that year. Ultimately the printing-offices were again moved to a house belonging to the Sorbonne, though the sign of the \" Golden Sun \" was still preserved. Printers now began to multiply rapidly in Pari-. One of the most celebrated was Antoine Verard, who from 1485 published a large number of works, chiefly in French, and remarkable for the beauty of their Gothic characters. Towards the end of 1400, at the period when the Bridge of Notre Dame, on which his house stood, gave way, he removed to a spot near the crossway ot Saint-Severin, afterwards shifting twice more \u2014 first to the Rue Saint-Jacques, and then to the Rue Neuve-Notre-Dame, where he remained till his death.

Charles IX. showed no little favour to printing. By letters patent, dated March, 1560, he confirmed and continued to the printers all those favours, rights, privileges, liberties, exemptions, and so forth, which had been ceded by his royal predecessors. One printer, however, -Martin Lhomme by name, derived small benefit from these letters patent, for in the same year, on a decree ofthe Parliament, he was hanged.

He was condemned, according to the Parliamentary decree, \" to be hanged and strangled on a scaffold erected in the Place Maubert, a suitable and convenient spot.\" The goods of the prisoner were to be confiscated to the king, and the objectionable book was to be burned in the printer's presence previously to his execution. Not long afterwards, in September, 1503, an ordinance appeared which proclaimed that all printers, binders, and sellers of libellous placards and other publications should be punished, for the first offence with the whip, for the second with death. A further ordinance, issued the same month, forbade printers to put any unau thorised volume in type \" under pain of being hanged and strangled.\" The art of Gutenberg, however, resisted all these measures, and apparently the king did not ere in his hostile projects, for in 1543 he exempted the printers from service in the City Guard.

Louis XIII., or rather his powerful minister, again introduced the censorship ; and, later on, every reader of Moliere knows what trouble the great comic dramatist met with at the hands of the censorship in connection with one of his masterpieces, Tartufe.

The cynicism of the hero's reflections was declared to be in opposition (as Moliere intended it to be) to religious feeling ; and the Parliament thought it impious that Sganarelle (afterwards the Leporello of Mozart) should, on seeing his master carried down to eternal torments, think of nothing but his wages and ask pathetically from whom he was to get them. Under Louis XIV. the political side of the censorship first shows itself. In a farce played at the Theatre Italien under the title of La Fausse Prude, Mine, de Maintenon was recognised ; and when Racine, at Mme. de Maintenon's request, composed Esther for the pupils of St. Cyr, the piece seemed full of political allusii ins, and everyone at Court was so convinced that Esther was Mme. de Maintenon, and Vashti Mme. de Montespan, that the performance was at take infinite trouble in order to get permission to produce his Mahomet.

At first all pieces in which and queens appeared were prohibited, but the dramas of sans culottes origin were or to forbid their representation.\" Under the Restoration the censorship was not less severe than under Napoleon. The performance of Arnault's Germanicus in 1815 had results which almost seemed to justify the censorship's existence. So excited did the audience become, that many of them rose from their seats and fought with walking-sticks. It is from this moment that the order dates by which no walking-sticks or umbrellas must be brought into the theatre. Towards the end of the Restoration, when the romantic school had just arisen in France, with Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas as its prin cipal champions on the stage, the censorship, without ceasing to be political and moral, gave itself literary airs, and, inspired by the calm- nd moderation of the old classical school, forbade violent scenes and scenes in which ideas of death and, above all, suicide were presented. Thus, in a translation of Hamlet, the grave yard scene had to be considerably abridged. Out of consideration for Victor Hugo, who in these early days was a royalist, and who, throughout his long life, was the foremost poet of France, the Minister of Fine Arts, M. de Martignac, consented to read all his pieces and decide upon them himself. He began with \" Marion Delorme,\" and authorised the representation of that fine work, when suddenly there was a change of Cabinet, and the new minister, M. de la Bourdonnaye, forbade it. d'hrough the intervention, however, of M. Trouve, Director of Fine Arts, permission was obtained to bring out Hernani, to which all kinds of objections had previously been made. After the overthrow of Charles X.'s Govern ment, in July, 1830, the censorship was absolutely abolished ; but, as equally happened after the previous revolution of ijSq and the subsequent one of 1848, it was very soon re-established. In the month of August M. Guizot, Minister of the Interior, named a commission for the examina tion of questions connected with the liberty of the stage. \" I proposed,\" he says in his Memoirs, \"to re-establish a serious dramatic censorship, which would defend public decency against the cynicism and greed of speculators in corruption.\" It was objected to M. Guizot's proposition that the proper course to pursue would be to allow managers full liberty of pro duction, and to punish them by ordinary police measures if they produced anything contrary to public morals. This proposition was com bated by the vain argument that to stop the upid that the Republic was absolutely obliged to return to the old monarchical repertory.

Nevertheless, they inspired a natural and just interest as long ago as the time of Charlemagne, places in the religious houses were full, assistance was given to the old soldiers, and in some cases fixed pensions. But they were for the most part in deplorable circumstances. Philip Augustus, the first of our kings who maintained a standing army, conceived the idea of creating special establishments for his old soldiers, and his grandson Saint Louis, on his return from the Crusades, carried out to a certain degree the project formed by Philip Augustus. The in stitution he founded was intended, however, for the reception only of men of birth who had been blinded by the burning sands of Palestine.

Louis XII., the \" father of his people,\" Francis I., the \"father of letters,\" and Henri II. , the noble husband of Catherine de Medicis, occupied themselves more or less with the fate of old and wounded soldiers. Finally, on the 28th of October, 156.8, Charles IX. published a decree regulating the admission of wounded veterans to the priories and abbeys. Under various pretexts old soldiers, it would seem, had been admitted into religious houses without suf ficient authority. The ecclesiastical bodies com plained of haying these warriors quartered upon them, and the warriors on their side complained of Christian Charity and the House of Lourcine \u25a0 and she afterwards ci 'ininanded that the mutilated officers and soldiers should go, as in the past to find shelter as recluses in the abbeys and prii liable for their maintenance. This unsatisfactory system led to all kinds ,,f abuses, and the complaints of the m. brotherhoods at length assumed an absolutely violent character.

Unfortunately, how ever, just when the new institution was on the point of being inaugu rated (the public sheets had pomp otisly announced it, and a pro of the Commanderie of Saint Louis, with flag anel banner, had proclaimed it in the streets) the whole thing was suddenly and unaccountably abandoned.

There is a special table for those who, having been wounded in the jaw, cannot masticate their food. Easily digestible hashes, soups, etc., are prepared for them by the \"sisters\"; and their table is furnished with no niggardly regard for expense. The most remarkable member of the Legion oi Honour who ever dwelt in the Hotel des Invalides was a witlow named Brulon, who, in times past, disguised in male uniform, had seen no end of military service, fighting, sonic-times by her husband's sitle, with distinguished valour. She had been through seven campaigns, and bore the marks of three very decided wounds. Entiling the ranks in i.Sii, she became a corporal thi following year, a sub-lieutenant by royal mandate in i S j 2 , and a member of the Legion ot II in 1.S47. She died in 1848, deeply lamented by all who knew her, none \u00bbf whom had ever seen her in feminine attire. The death of Louis XIV. was keenly regretted by the pensioners, who sent representatives to his funeral clad in deepest mourning. The death of Louis XV., who was more beloved by his people generally, caused little sorrow at the Invalides, the pensioners viewing the funeral cortege, as it passed along, with frigid eye.

The director, it should be added, is seldom or never a physician, but a member of the administrative body. The council of superintendence consists, amongst its other members, of the Prefect of the Seine, the Prefect of Police, a Councillor of State, a member of the Court of Appeal, a Professor of the Faculty of Medicine, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and two members of the Municipal Council, with a doctor and a surgeon attached to the hospital. The medical service of the hospitals is effected by doctors and surgeons, aided by resident anil non-resident assistants, sisters of charity, etc. The doctors and surgeons are appointed by competition, and they can practise, in the case of the former, till sixty-five, in that of the latter, till sixty years ot age. As regards the conditions under which patients are admitted to the hospitals, the first of these is not, a- one might suppose, that the applicant be ill, but that he or she have been resident six months in the department of the Seine. This condition, which excluded poor patients coming to Paris from the provinces for special treatment, caused some years ago a good deal of lively criticism. Complaints, too, have frequently been made of the alleged extravagance of the adminis tration and of the architectural embellishment of Paris hospitals, to the detriment of the patients upon whom in a direct manner the funds should, it was held, have been spent. Another defect which has been much commented upon is the inability of the surgeons to assign beds, on their own authority, to sick applicants whom they have pronounced to be in need of clinical treatment. Every morning, it should be explained, gratuitous advice is given at each hospital. Those applicants whose case is serious cannot, without further preliminaries, have beds assigned to them. The physician has first to represent their condition to the administrative director, and it is within the power of this latter functionary to grant or to refuse the admission. In practice, no doubt, the recom mendation of the physician is acceded to ; but the formality might well become, in some in stances, a mischievous one.

Tho arts which have enabled the sublimest efforts of genius to dazzle the world do not, in our opinion, merit greater attention from scholars and philo sophers than the method which shall open to the deaf-mutes a road leading to intellectual labour and to the full enjoy ment of civil and pi ilitical rights.\" Looking hack to antiquity, this excellent writer points out that the ancients regarded the educa tion of deaf-mutes as an impossibility both physical and moral. It was the custom at Sparta to allow children suffering from this double infirmity to die of hunger and thirst in the desert, where they w ere for that purpose exposed ; and the laws of Solon were on this point no less severe. Aristotle, it he did not precisely justify the rigour of such laws, at least endorsed the moral prescription. In the fourth book of his History of Animals he unhesitatingly relegates deaf-mutes to the rank idiots, declaring them hopelessly beyond all tuition. The Republic of Rome did not show itself more humane. It was in vain that intel ligence beamed in the face of these unhappy victims : if their tongue could produce no sound thew were condemned to he flung into the Tiber. One of the earliest agents in the removal ot this weight of infamy from the fraternity ot deaf-mutes was, curiously enough, the stage. Lucian eulogises the pantomime of the- dunib show actor, of his epoch, and the admirable- influence they exercised in raising the deaf and speechless above general contempt, ddie Egyptians and Persians, more- civilised and en- lightened in this respect than Sparta, Athens, or Rome, showed for their deaf-mutes a solicitude which approached devotion. In centuries less remote- many efforts have from time to time been made by philosophers and philanthropists to invent an effectual method of instructing deaf-mutes, ddie sign method of the Abbe de l'Epee was one of the first great steps in this direction. The abbe held that the old- fashioned dactylology was insufficient, anel that ns were essential to those who could neither hear nor speak. Starting from the incontest- able- principle that the bond existing between ideas and sounds which strike the ear is not more intimate, more natural, than the bond between ideas and traced characters which strike the eye, he found it by no means difficult to demonstrate the possibility of fully replacing speech, in the case of a deaf-mute, by mimicry. As regards this mimicry, M. Berthier cautions people against the common mistake of confound ing it with dactylology, or the language of the fingers. Dactylology is confined to the reproduction of the letters of the- alphabet of anj particular language, one by one, syllable bj syllable, word by word, or in no matter what other conventional manner. Mimicry, a faithful picture of human thought, paints ideas and sen timents in a living language \u2014 the innate Ian ot all nations \u2014 the language of humanity means of it thoughts are exchanged more quickly than by speech or writing \u2014 not to mention dactylology, which lags so tar behind. In the midst of his brilliant triumphs the Abbe de l'Epee had frequently to engage in con flict with two classes of powerful adversaries: the philosophers and the theologians ; the former re garding words as the only vehicle for imp.. metaphysical ideas, the latter regarding them as thesole means of inculcating supernatural reli truths. Louis XVI. had granted the abbe out of his own privy purse an annual pension of <>,ooo francs, in addition to his official appointment at the Celestins. Hitherto the school had, for twelve years, been maintained entirely at the cost of the founder, aided by such occasional alms as he received for the purpose. It was at the Celestins in 178') that he expired, amid the weeping of his pupils and with the delightful thought that his work would not perish with him. Amongst the disciples of the Abbe de 1 must be mentioned the Abb. Sicard, can Bordeaux, whom the archbishop of that town sent to Paris, where he had founded a deaf-mute institution, in order that he might study under de l'Epee that method ol which there v much talk.

The brothers of the Order of St. John of God had already a place of their own, which they gave up in order to take possession of the larger premises placed at their disposal by Queen Marguerite. A capa cious house, surrounded by vast gardens, was the first home of La Charite;. Here patients were received and treated by the brethren, who, besides religion, had studied medicine, surgery, and pharmacy. d'heir vows did not allow them to admit women, and their utility seems to have been further limited by insufficient know ledge of the art of healing ; and this notwithstanding the fact that several of \\r IHE MATERNITY HOSPITAL"], [648, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW. 2o6 [Some more Paris Hapitik, was placed under the direction of the .Munici pality of Paris.

We have not far to go back id the demented treated as criminals, or - demoniacs, or put to death as magi- and sorcerers. Mr. H. C. Burdett, who ecently published a work on the hospitals sylums of the world, divides the history of lunatics and their treatment into four periods. I. An early period when, at the beginning of 1 a, the insane were brought to- 1 and pi, u.d under intelligent control. \u2014 In this connection Mr. Burdett cites the- rules l\"i ihe treatment of lunatics by Aret\u00e6us -0) and Soranus 1 vie Qf). ddie latter, in directions of great minuteness as temperature and turniture of the rooms, . -ments of the bed, the physical .md I., which the patients afflicted ntia were to he subjected. The intendents, according to the rules of this I. were to have strict instructions to repress ot the patients in such a way as not to 1 rate them by too much sharpness, and yet nut permit them, by too much weakness, to in- their unreasonable demands. Subsequent writers deal with insanity in a like spirit of en- \"nient down to Paulus \u00c6gineta ( a.d. 650).

Ambrose Pard.the celebrated French surgeon, medical attendant of Francis I., fully believed that lunatics were possessed by the devil. \"They may often be seen,\" he says, \"to change into goats, asses, dogs, wolves, crows, and frogs ; they cause thunder and lightning, lift castles into the air, and fascinate the- eve.\" King Louis XIV. has been much reproached since bis death as he- was adulated during his lifetime. To him, in any ease, is due the first movement against the cruel \u2014 the absolutely insane treatment of the insane. In 1070 a trial took place in Nor mandy which ended in the condemnation of seventeen people to the stake, either as lunatics or as sorcerers. A rat, it was sworn, had been seen talking to a child ; anel on the stre: a this evidence everyone who could be brought into connection with the strange incident was sentenced to death. The king was indignant, and soon afterwards a decree- was published forbidding trials ot the kind in future. III. ddie period of torture. \u2014 Though no longer subject to death punishment by fire, lunatic- w ere almost as badly oil in the eighteenth and at the beginning of the nineteenth century as at an earlier time. Such asylums as existed in France and other countries up to the present century were entirely of a monastic kind ; and it was not, as before mentioned, until the reign of Louis Philippe that any regular secular institution for the treatment of the insane was founded, ddie unhappy lunatics were probably happiest in those countries where least notice was taken of them ; for not a century ago they were liable, when \"cared for,\" to copious bleeding, shower-baths, sudden frights, and rigid coercion. In some places they were chained and flogged at the changes of the moon, or they were placed under the charge of criminals, who set dogs on them and tortureel them to death, ddie doctors, instead of checking these barbarities, encouraged them ; and from time to time invented new ones. They it was who introduced the \" circular swing \" and \" bath of surprise.\" One torture, diabolically devised, was to lower the patient into a well, chain him there, and allow the water to rise gradually to his mouth in order to give a shock to his nerves. An unhappy man named Norris"], [650, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW. 208 [Lunwi, was in England, at the so-called Ht>s[iital of Bethlem, fixed to the wall bv the neck and waist so that he could not move a foot or raise his arms ; and, thus attached, he remained for twelve years.

For the First Revolution, then, with all its mad excesses, must be claimed the honour of having introduced in modern times the humane treatment ofthe insane. The Revolution, indeed, 1 ipened not only a \" career to talent,\" but a path to very useful reform. The mad patients were now taken from the Hotel Dieu and other hos pitals to be placed at Charenton, Bicetre, and La Salpetriere (1802-1807). From that time these asylums, placed under the direction of eminent medical men, changed their character.

Before entering the hospital the church is worthy of observation. Louis XIV. ordered it to be built in December, 1669, and it was con structed bv the celebrated architect, Levau. It is of octagonal form, and like the ancient basil of which the model is preserved by the Greek Church in Russia and elsewhere, it is sur mounted by five cupolas : a central one, beneath which stands the high altar, and four lateral uiies covering an equal number of chapels.

In 1756 the Marchioness de Lassay caused to De constructed at her own expense the superb building which bears her name, and which forms a pendant to that of Mazarin. At the period last mentioned La Salpetriere still contained, as at its origin, the most strangely mixed population that could be conceived. At the end of the last century, and more particularly at the beginning of the present, efforts were made to transform this \"frightful sewer,\" as Camus called it. From 1801 to 1804 La Force was evacuated. Its feminine inhabitants transferred to Lourcine, the children went to the Orphcdins ; the insane were separated from the infirm and placed in a special quarter. From 181 5 to 1823, in virtue of a very strong report drawn up by M. de Pastoret, the dungeons of La Salpetriere were destroyed, the sanitation improved, the dormitories enlarged and well ventilated, the furniture renewed, and the diet improved. Finally, as if to efface all memory of the past, the asylum received the name of Hospital for Old Age. Other subsequent ameliorations, notably those effected in 1830, 1845, 1848, and [8fl, have contributed to render La Salpetriere what it certainly is in the present day\u2014 the finest institution ofthe kind in France. 'Lhe total population of the establishment is no less than 5,000, comprising as it does some Soo employes, 1,500 lunatics, and nearly 3,600 patients, old or infirm. The annual expenses amount to nearly two million francs. Within the precincts of La Salpetriere the visitor might fancy himself in a small town. There is a church, a letter box, a tobacco shop, a butcher's shop, ware houses, wash-houses, and a market, or rather bazaar, where all sorts of goods are retailed, such as fruit, vegetables, sweetmeats, and pastry ; there are streets named after the establishments to which they lead \u2014 Laundry Street, Ritchen Street, Church Street, and so on ; there are large promenades and pretty gardens, together with courts, squares, and \" places \" bearing the illus trious name of a founder, a benefactress, a physician, or a saint immortalised by charity.

Those who are well Ji, to the number of 850, take their meals in the refectory; the others, upwards of 1,700, erved in the dormitories. 'Lhe annual mortality among the indigent inmates averages r cent.

Rostan and Georget in 1822 made at La Salpetriere experiments in animal magnetism, which attracted much attention in the scientific world, especially as regards two subjects, now well known in the history of somnabulism : the young Petronilla, and the widow Brouillard, nicknamed Braquette, whose clairvoyance was some years later put to a delicate test by three mischievous house surgeons, MM. Dechambre, Diday, and Debrou. A number of interesting and very important experiments in the new science (fir old science under a new name) of hypnotism have been made by Charcot and his pupils at this institution. Here, too, a close examination and analysis of the cerebral manifest ations of the insane led some subtle anatomist to the conclusion that genius was but a form of insanity. There was one physician of La Sal petriere, M. Lelut, member of the Chamber of Deputies, and of the Institute, who, in two remarkable works, endeavoured to prove that in the minds of Socrates and of Pascal there was, tit least, a touch of madness. Another learned physician, attached during the Louis Philippe period to the Salpetriere, M. Trelat \u2014 described by Dr. Linas as \" an excellent man, ex-minister, and not a member of the Legion of Honour\" \u2014 wrote a book, which may be classed with the one just named, on \" Lucid Madness.\" The department which occupies the southern extremity of La Salpetriere is the one specially devoted to lunatics. Placed at the head of the hnieiit in 1705, Pinel introduced at this hospital the- same beneficent reforms with which he had already endowed Bicetre. He at once did away with the chains, fetters, and irons with which, until his time, the patients were loaded, and he filled up the subterranean dungeons in which unhappy women, half naked, had often had their feet gnawed by rats, or frozen by the cold ..I winter. From 1818 to 183b Esquirol, pupil, le, and friend of Pinel, introduced new modification- to soften the lot ofthe deranged. Connected with La Salpetriere are many in- ing traditions. During its earliest days St. Vincent de Paul ministered constantly to the patients. Here Bossuet, on the 2qth of June, pronounced his panegyric on St. Paul, one masterpieces of Christian eloquence. Here .nfuied in 1788 the mysterious personage calling herself Madame de Donhault, whose identity has never been established, and who is in judicial annals as the \" woman with- \\ NAME,\" or \"THK SHAM MARCHIONKSS. \" hut up the widow and accomplice famous poisoner, Desrues, massacred with thirty-five other prisoners on the 4th of Sept ember, 1702.

The Salpetriere has been the cradle of import ant physical ami psychological studies in con- 1 with brain disea.-es. These have some- taken a slightly fantastic form, as when \"ULiirolaiidhi-n. ph, u. Dr. Miture, endeavoured Bicetre, an asylum of the same character as La Salpetriere, derives its name from the familiar Winchester. On the site of Bicetre, in the year of grace 1284, Jean de Pontoise, Bishop of Winchester, built near Paris a manor house, which, after the name of his see, he called Winchester, soon corrupted into Wicester, which, by a further process of corruption, became successively Bicestre and Bicetre. After going through various hands, and at last passing into the king's possession, Bicetre was given in 1656 by Louis XIV. to be turned into a hospital for old men above the age of seventy, lame and in curable children, the blind, the paralytic, the imbecile, and the epileptic, together with women of dissolute life, who were to be received only on condition of being corrected, whipped, and fed on bread and water. At the period of the Revolution Bicetre was at once a hospital, an asylum, a prison, ami a house of correction, until, in 1701, it became at the same time a madhouse. The lunatic- were at first mixed up with the criminals, or con fined in horrible dungeons, but at length the"], [654, "212 PARIS, OLD AND NEW.

To prevent the return of any such disturbance- an adminis trative order was issued in 1850, instituting the following penalties against particular offences: stoppage of wine, withdrawal of leave to go out, imprisonment and expulsion from the asylum. It may be seen from the above that it is not alone in the mad division of the hospital that lunatics are to be found. directed, their bad instincts reformed, and in time, according to their aptitude, they are made cobblers, carpenters, and so on. Many children admitted as idiots leave the asylum every year to exercise these trades, and live by their work. Criminal lunatics, condemned by a verdii dangerous ones, certified as such, are kept in a building called La Surete. Within this sinister rotunda the patients are kept in cells, and subjected night and day to the strictest surveil lance. The ordinary occupation of dangerous lunatics is the harmless one of cutting out artificial flowers. ddieir occasional tits of violence are dealt with only by the application of the strait-jacket. Many of the officials at Bicetre look upon the place not only as a home, but as a native land. Born at Bicetre of parents who were preceded at the same institution by their own parents, the functionaries form a sort of official dynasty. Bicetre has had its celebrities, its dramas, its memorable events. In legendary times the hill-side of Geiitilly was haunted In Wehr-wolves, and the wizards of the neighboui hood held sabbath there. Interesting anecdotes have been told about the captivity of Salomon de Caux in the dungeons of Bicetre, and the visit of Marion Delorme to the inventor, supposed by many of his countrymen to have constructed the first steam engine. At the time, howevi Salomon de Caux (1580-1630) Bicetre was a magnificent country house, and neither a prison nor an asylum. It is certain, on the other hand, that this establishment has reckoned among its prisoners or its patients Latude, the unhappy victim of the hatred of Mme. de Pompadour, who, after escaping three times from Vincennes and the Bastille, was three times re-arrested, and finally delivered, alter thirty-five years of captivity, by the courageous perseverance of Mine. Legros. ddie pathetic story of Latude might be told in connection with more than one ot the I prisons, mixed establishments, and lunatic asylums ; for he was confined successively m the Bastille, the Castle of Vincennes, at Charenton, and, finally, at Bicetre. With a g escaping from imprisonment, anil an equal aptitude for getting recaptured, this energetic, yet light-minded, and, in sum, most unhappy man, provoked his first incarceration by a too ingenious device which he adopted with the view of securing the favour of Mm Pompadour, the all-powerful favourite ut XV. He was a lieutenant in the army when the idea occurred to him of obtaining promotion by The lunatic department at Bicetre is divided into three sections ; the first and second being assigned to adult lunatics, the third to epileptics and idiots. The study in which peaceable lunatics assemble to read, write, or draw is interesting, if only for the objects of art which adorn it : busts, statues, water-colours, engrav ings, sepias, and pen-and-ink drawings, some by unknown artists, others by artists of celebrity \u2014 many of them inmates, for a while, at least, of the asylum. In the time of Dr. Linas (some twenty years ago) there wa- a painter in the lunatic wards of Bicetre, a former priest, known in the house as \"Monsieur L'Abbe,\" who, if he had not gone mad, would, in the opinion of Dr. Linas, have earned renown. \"Nothing,\" says the doctor, \" is more curious than his symbolical picture of 'Life' : a vast composition, in which tue represented, with wonderful harmony of ensemble, and a prodigious fecundity of detail, all the splendour and all the misery, all the heights and all the depths, all the virtues and all the ill the grandeurs and all the infamies, all the beauty and all the turpitude, of human existence from the cradle to the grave.\" The ward for epileptic and idiotic children is the saddest of all, bv its arrangement and general exterior, as well as by the condition of the patients. These are well cared for. Un happy creatures, who were formerly regarded as the tlregs of humanity, are now made the object of the most devoted solicitude. Two physicians, of heart as well as of talent, were the first to show that idiocy has its degrees, and is not absolutely refractory to intellectual culture. At their suggestion a school for idiots was instituted at Bicetre in 1842, and since then untiring endeavour has been made to further their educa tion. They are taught to speak, to read, to -ing.

With the wood they made a ladder to aid them, when they had descended into the moat, in getting up the parapet on the other side. All the preparations having been finished, the two prisoners chose for their escape a dark wintry night, when there was but little chance of their movements being observed. They began by climbing the chimney, one after the other. Then having fastened the rope, they one after the other slid down, till, excited, exhausted, and with bleeding hands, they reached the moat in safety. The wooden ladder enabled them, as their next step, to get over the parapet, which brought them into the governor's garden. The wall which surrounded it was too high to climb, and they had no second ladder with which to escalade it. Fortunately, in view of some diffi culty of this kind, they had provided themselves with a strong wooden stick, and this they made use of for picking out the mortar, loosening the bricks, and ultimately making a hole sufficiently large for them to crawl through. During this laborious and dangerous work, when the very noise they were making might at any moment cause their discovery, day broke, and they had just time to force themselves through the aperture they had made, when there were already signs of movement within the fortress. Latude and his companion had just taken refuge in one of the narrow streets surrounding the Bastille when the alarm-bell sounded. Their flight had been discovered. D'Aligre, disguised as a peasant, had no difficulty in passing the frontier. He was arrested at Brussels. Latude, informed of the capture of his friend, changed his route, but was equally unfortunate. Just when he was on the point of taking ship for India the police seized him at Amsterdam. He was brought back to the Bastille. Transferred a few months later to the Castle of Vincennes, he succeeded on the 25th of June, 17:0, in making his escape, and in this very original manner. Watching until he found one prison euites open, he ran out and, breath- is he wa-, asked every sentinel he passed whether he had seen the Abbe de Saint Sauveur, whose ministrations were needed for a dying ter. Taking him for one of the officials of the establishment, the sentinels allowed him to hurry on \u2014 allowed him, that is to say, to make , ape. Latude was unable to profit by his liberty. Convinced that Mme. de Pompadour would pardon him his thoughtless act, he wrote her a letter of regret and appeal, related to her , and confided to her his place of con cealment. But the selfish marchioness could rget that he had caused her a moment's fright. She sent his letter to the Lieutenant of Police, ami the poor man was once more thrown into the Bastille, with orders that he was to be strictly watched. One day, however, the ior took pity on him, and to render his captivity le-- rigorous gave him a companion.

It was in these words : \u2014 \" On the 25th of this month of September, 1 700, I shall have had 100,000 hours of suffering.\" He thought for a moment that this pathetic utterance might restore him to liberty. But he had still 200,000 hours to count. Permission was now given to him to walk on the terrace of the tower. He succeeded in awakening the interest of two young laun dresses whose garret-windows looked out upon the walls of the Bastille ; and one fine day in April, 1764, these girls, by means of large letters traced on a strip of paper, informed him that the woman who had persecuted him was dead. In his usual impulsive way, Latude now wrote to the Lieutenant of Police, telling him that he lous inspection of the state prisons, saw him, heard the tale of his woes, and promised to do him justice. Circumvented, however, by the Lieutenant of Police, who represented Latude as a dangerous lunatic, he, with the best inten tions, ordered the poor wretch to be removed to Charenton. This was still further to aggravate the captive's condition, for Charenton was bv several degrees worse than Vincennes. Madmen were then treated in the cruellest fashion, con fined in narrow cells, and fed on a disgu diet. Allowed a little more freedom than the other inmates, he was shocked to find, in a fetid little dungeon, loaded with chain mercilessly beaten by the warders, his old com panion D'Aligre, whose reason had not been able to survive his misfortune-, w hi 1 scarcely recog his friend, and who died shortly astern"], [659, "and Mixed Institutions.] LATUDE'S ADVENTURES 217 The adventures of Latude, however, had now attracted the attention of the outside world. He had been able so far to elude the vigilance of the warders as to get a lew letters delivered to influential personages. An order for his liberation, almost immediately revoked, was signed in 1777. The victim had hardly started out for Montagnac, his native place, when .is re-arrested \u2014 though here again he probably had his own folly to thank, for he man whom nothing could tame, whose voice shook the walls, and whose wit and audacity were invincible. . . .

That was the obstacle which had frustrated the benevolent desires of Males herbes, Lemoignon, and Rohan. Latude was to remain in captivity simply because he had already been in captivity too long.\" \"Mine. Legros,\" says Michelet, \"did not see the destruction of the Bastille. She dud a little before. But it was she, none the le--, who had the glory of destroying it. It was she who filled the popular mind with hatred and horror of this arbitrary prison which had received so many martyrs of Faith and Thought. The weak hand of a poor woman pulled down, in reality, that high fortress, threw to the ground its massive stones, tore down its iron gratings, and razed its towers.\" Mme. Legros, however, courageously under took the work of justice, and nobly persevered with it in spite of all. During three years she solicited everybody, notwithstanding the misery in which she was herself living \u2014 for the police tried to intimidate her, and threatened her with transportation or imprisonment. She persisted all the same ; and having lost her little business, she sacrificed her last resources to the cause which she had made her own. By dint of inter viewing the valets of ministers and the femmes de-chambre of ladies of high rank, she at length managed to interest Marie Antoinette herself in the fate of Latude. Louis XVI. promised to look into the matter, ami had the police docu ments brought to him \u2014 papers, that is to say, pre pared by those who only desired that the prisoner might die on their hands. The decision, there fore, of the monarch was that Latude, as a very dangerous man, must never be released. Even this did not discourage Mme. Legros, who, indeed, had public opinion on her side. 'Lhe popular wave was already mounting high ; it submerged the inflexible Sartines, ami, after him, Lenoir. The Academy gave it a further impulse by awarding to Mme. Legros, in 17X3, the prize of virtue as recompense for her heroic perseverance in the cause she hail espoused. All that the minister Breteuil could obtain from this independent body was that the grounds on which the prize was awarded should not be proclaimed. The blow directed against the police and the court was a heavy one, ami early the next year Latude was finally set free. He was then on the verge of his sixtieth year ; he had passed thirty-five years in prison. As sole indemnity after so much suffering, he was granted a pension of 400 francs \" in con sideration of his lost patrimony,\" as the official order phrased it ; and even this was conditional upon his quitting Paris to live in his native province. Mme. Legros, by dint of tact and of petitions, got this sentence of exile re- So much, then, for the celebrated Latude and his heroic deliverer. Among other notable inmates of Bicetre may be mentioned the accomplice and denouncer of Cartouche, who lived forty-three years in a dungeon ; the author of \" Justine \" \u2014 the Marquis de Sade\u2014 a perfect example of erotic madness ; and the four sergeants of La Rochelle, those heroic champions of liberty whom the devotion of two of the house-surgeons would have saved but for the treachery of the chaplain. The story of the four sergeants of I .a Iv 11 lull. , so well known in France, and so often reft to by contemporary French writers, is so little known in England that it may here with pi\" priety be told ; for it was at La Salpetriere that the last act, or last but one, of this trageib played. in the year 1821, under the Restoration, [ohn Francois Louis Leclerc Bories, sergeant-major in the 45th regiment ofthe line, was in garri- Paris when he was initiated into the society of the Charbonniers, corresponding to that ot the Carbonari in Italy.

But no order to take up arms was transmitted, and the 45th arrived at La Rochelle on the 14th us February without any incident of importance having taken place.

Among the advocates for the defence were men, with Chaix-d'Fst-Anges, Mocquart, and others of the same mark, who afterwards reached the highest positions, and who were all at this time Carbonari and sworn enemies ot the Bourbons. At the end of a trial which had lasted a fortnight the president of the court asked each of the accused if he had anything to add to his defence. Bories, whose self-possession had never for one moment left him, rose and said with much dignity : \"Gentlemen of the jury, the Advocate- General, while declaring that the most eloquent oratory in the world would be powerless to save me from public vengeance, has pointed to me as the chief criminal. Well, I accept this position, and shall deem myself happy if by bringing my head to the scaffold I can obtain the acquittal of all my comrades.\" He was condemned to death, together with three other sergeants \u2014 Goubin, Raoulx, and Pomier. Goupillon was let off as informer. Seven others were condemned to imprisonment for different periods, while thirteen more were acquitted. There were groans and sobs in court when the capital sentence was pronounced, and public opinion pronounced itself in the strongest manner in favour of the unfortunate young men, against neither of whom any overt act was charged. But the Government of Louis XVIII. was implacable ; and on the 2lst of Sep tember, 1X22, the scaffold was erected on the Place de Greve. The four sergeants submitted to their fate with heroic calmness, and bent their heads beneath the knife of the guillotine amid cries of \" Vive la Liberte ! \" The same evening, to the disgust of everyone, there was a grand party at the Tuileries. Serious attempts had been made by the Car bonari to save the unhappy victims.

The allied German powers who were marching upon Paris, and whose outposts were gradually approaching the capital, had already taken the fortress of Verdun, and were prepared, if they continued their successful campaign, to inflict terrible vengeance on the Revolutionists and on the French nation gen erally. A counter-revolutionary movement had suddenly set in among the Royalist proprietors and the loyal, if superstitious, peasants of Brittany and La Vendee. With the exaggera tion sure to manifest itself at moments of great popular excitement, it was declared that the enemy was at the gates of Paris ; and it was proclaimed among the fanatics of the Revolu tion that in a few hours the nobles and ecclesi astics thrown into prison, in some cases with a view to trial, in others only as a precautionary measure, would soon be at liberty and ready to take part in the slaughter of the Republicans. 'Lhe people had been summoned by Danton to the Champ de Mars in order to be enrolled for service against the enemy. Alarm-bells were sounded, cannons were fired, and a general war-cry resounded through Paris. \" The tocsin,\" says a journal ofthe period, \" was heard on all sides. Everyone ran to take up arms. Every one cried out, ' To the enemy ! ' But the enemy is not in the field alone. The enemy is at Paris, as well as around Verdun. Our foes are in the Paris prisons.

Let us exterminate these monsters, who will profit by our absence with the army to murder our wives and our children, to liberate Louis XVI. from his tower, and to rally the Royalist battalions.\" This terrible cry was at once taken up in a unanimous, universal manner throughout the streets and public places, at all public meetings, and finally in the National Assembly itself. Some time afterwards, towards the end oi 1792, Bicetre, which had just been the theatre of such tragic scenes, had the glory of seeing accomplished within its walls the reforms in the treatment of lunacy introduced by Pinel. This excellent man, chief physician at Bicetre, had begged the Commune of Paris for authority to unchain the violent lunatics. The next day the fanatical Couthon went to Bicetre to make sure that Pined was \"not concealing the eiiein the people among his madmen.\" Astounded and somewhat frightened by the confused shrieking and howling ofthe maniacs, and by the rattling ol their chains, the surly Jacobin turned to Pinel and said to him : \" Why, you must be mad yourself, citizen, to think of unchaining such animals.\" \"lam convinced,\" replied Pinel, \"that these lunatics are only so intractable because they are deprived of air and liberty.\" \" Well, do what you like,\" cried Couthon, as he went away ; \"do what you like : I abandon them to you.\" Pinel at once entered the cage of tin terrible of his madmen : an English captain who had been shut up for forty years, and who, a few days previously, had killed one of the ke with a blow from his fetters. Full of faith, the physician unlocked his irons ; and the mad man becoming at once gentle and calm, was, during the two years he had still to live, Piucd's most useful assistant. Pinel restored successively to liberty an old officer who, in a moment ol frenzy, had stabbed one of his own children ; a young poet mad from love, who, after 1. Bicetre, perished on the scaffold; a so formerly in the Royal Guard ; Cheving athlete, the terror of his keepers, who afterwards gave his liberator a striking proof ot gratitude by snatching him from a band b fanatics at the very moment when they were about to hang him ; and fifty others, ot all conditions and all countries, who, as soon as they were treated with humanity, gave up their habits of violence. Apart from the purely spontaneous, impulsive movement, meetings were held after formal deliberations, and it was decided by a resolution that the aristocrats and priests confined in the prisons must be put to death.

With all his tyranny, M. de Coulmier had many agreeable ways. Remembering the fury of Saul, calmed by the harp of the youthful David, and the quieting of savage animals by the lyre of Orpheus, the director, carried away by his artistic feeling, determined to apply a similar treatment to the demented ones of Charenton. To carry out his idea he introduced dancing. dramatic performances, fireworks, and even ballets, with the assistance of some of the choregraphic celebrities of the epoch. The imprisoned Marquis de Sade, known by books that no decent person can read, was the organiser of these entertainments, which were attended by all Paris. It has been seen that neither at Bicetre nor at La Salpetriere are lunatics alone confined. The one recognised madhouse in or near Paris, to which those whose ideas or actions excite the disapproval of their friends are told familiarly to go\u2014 as, in England, they would be sent to Hanwell\u2014 is Charenton. The Maison de Chaien- ituated at about four miles south-east of Paris, on the road to Lyons, close to the con- fluence of the Seine and the Marne, dates from the year 164 1 , when Sebastien Leblanc, coun- sellor of the king and minister of war, presented it ready furnished to the brothers of La Charite, St. Jean de Dieu. A few years after their installation in the house presented to them, the brothers of La Charite arranged to receive mad- men and epileptic patients ; when, like all the madhouses of the time, Charenton became a house of detention, where were confined by I de cachet prisoners of state, prodigals, libertines, and others who were thought worthy ofa milder treatment than they would receive in the Bastille or at Vincennes. In the eighteenth century, and up to the time of the Revolution, Charenton had accommodation for nearly 100 lunatics, each of whom had his separate room. Ihe attendance was in the hands of ten us persons and fifty-two servants. A few- after the Revolution, both monastery and hospital were suppressed, and the monks, to- gether with the lunatics under their charge, dispersed. Soon \u2022 afterwards, however, t he- Directory issued a decree, which forms the legal basis of the hospital of Charenton as it now \"Refuge for the Mad\" was the title to it ; and it was now placed under the immediate direction of the Minister of the Interior. Insane persons of both sexes were to Imitted ; the indigent ones gratuitously, -hers at a fixed rate of payment. The Abbe de Coulmier, a former member of the . inbly, was named director of tablishment ; and, as if in compensation injury done to the establishment by its nidden dispersion, it had additional land assigned I he building could now be enlarged, and division was erected for the women. *' di t oulmier conducted the house in the '-potic manner ; anil on the death of the a, M Gastaldi, in 1805, he 1 1 [lowers in the medical department [hat the School of Medicine w..s obliged to To the joyous reign of M. de Coulmier succeeded, in 1814, the severe administration of Roulhac du Maupas. No more singing and dancing now ! Comedies and ballets gave place- to useful reforms, and the substitution of a new medical organisation for the former choregraphic system. Royer-Collard had sup- pressed the iron girdles, the fetters, the hand- cuffs, and the collars, by which the ungovernable- madmen used to be restrained, and the melan- choly ones driven to suicide. Esquirol did away with the human figures in wicker-work, in which violent maniacs used sometimes to be enclosed. The new programme met with the full approbation of the Government. A credit of 2,720,000 francs was voted by the Chamber of Deputies in July, 1838 ; and soon afterwards M. de Montalivet, then Minister of the In- terior, laid with due solemnity the first stone of the new edifice. The memory of this important ceremony is consecrated by an in scription placed beneath the vestibule of the principal building. At the back of the building is the wood of Vincennes, from which it is separated only by a wall, with a gate for the inmates of the asylum. In front the landscape comprises the immense and fertile plain of Maisons Alfort, Ivry, and Choisy-le-Roi. The panorama is one of the finest offered by the environs of Paris.

Like all the streams which flow past dye works, the Bievre is perpetually Stained ; and in the present day there are many scientific men who venture to affirm that the brilliant colours of the Gobelin tapestry are in noway due to water of any kind, but to artistic secrets belonging to the Gobelin brothers, and handed down by them to their descendants or successors.

When perfection had been attained the fortunate work was reserved for the royal palaces or for presentation to some foreign potentate.

Per fectly-made paste, but bad designs. The Sevres porcelain of the period of the First Empire was remarkable for the stiffness and sham-academical stele of the figures. From this epoch dates the custom of reproducing on cups and saucers, cases ami plates, copies of great historical pictures anel other unsuitable works. The landscapes, the pastoral pieces of Watteau and of Boucher, were far more appropriate. Under the Second Empire the Sevres manu factory cost the State 4X0,000 francs a year, and sold porcelain to the general public to the amount of 80,000 francs. There was a clear loss, then, to the establishment of 400,000 francs or /l6,ooo a year. After the fall of the Empire au attempt was made by M. Charles Gamier, the architect of the new opera, and M.

The building was icted in 1772 by the Italian architect, Gardini, at the orders of the Dowager-Duchess irbon. After passing through various hands, the Palais Bourbon was made national property at the time of the Revolution, when m de la Revolution \" was the name given hi 1795 its principal reception-rooms were rmeil into a hall for the Council of the Five Hundred, and it was at the same time cu- ddle present facade was added in 1804 '\u2022 iolei >n I.

Under the reign of Louis Philippe, in the best days of Guizot and Thiers, debates of the greatest interest took place at the Palais Bourbon in the \"Chamber of Deputies,\" as the French representative body was at that time called ; for with each new government the name of the assembly, as of almost every other institution in France, is changed. All public establishments are from time to time Royal, National, or Imperial ; and the body which corresponds in France to the House of Commons in England is called, turn by turn, Chamber of Representatives, Chamber of Deputies, or Leg lative Body. No country, indeed, has had so many legislative and governing assemblies as France, which until the Revolution was as nearly as possible an absolute monarchy. The States-General, under the ancient regime, were convoked from time to time by the king, but had no real power, ddie most that can be said in their favour is that they at least preserved among the people the idea of popular representa tion. In 1 7 SS, the year before the Revolution, there was a general demand for a convocation of the States-General, to which an unexpected reply was made by the calling together of Con stituent and Legislative Assemblies. These bodies both admitted the royal veto as a bar upon their decisions. But the Convention, the Revolution having now he-en accomplished, re cognised no counterbalancing power, no control any kind.

Some were for keeping him in prison until peace- was made with the im powers, and then sending him into exile on con dition of his ne-ver attempting to return. The greater number, however, of the deputies were in favour of death. One, more brutal than the others, is said to have recorded his view as to the sentence that should be passed in these cynical words: \"La mort sans phrase.\" M. Edouard Fournier has, however, well explained, in his admirable little volume, \" Les Mots Hi6toriques,\" that whereas in most eases the deputy signing the- register explained, in one or more phrase-, why he was in favour of a particular sentence, the sentence in this particular ease was given without one word of explanation, \"sans phrase\" in short, as the registrar put it. ddie day of the king's sentence, one of ihe deputies, Lcpcdlctier Saint-Fargcau, who had VOted for death, w mated just altel h( had left the Assembly, by a former member us the Body-guard named Paris, ddie Convention ordered that he should receive the honours of the Pantheon, and assisted in a body at his funeral, ddiis incident caused a deep sensation, deeper, it is said, even than the execution ut tin king, which took place ou the 2 1st of January 170;. ddie deepest indignation, too, excited by the news that among those who had voted for the king's death was his cousin, the Duke of Orleans, the so-called Philippe ite, whose son, Louis Philippe, was thirty seven years afterwards to ascend the French throne. Writing in the Revue des Deux Monde* a few years after the latter event, Ch.'iteaubriand reproached the reigning king in plain terms with being the son of a regicide. Arguing that since the execution of Louis XVI., and as -' punishment for that crime, it had become im possible to establish monarchy in France, he added : \u2014 \"Napoleon saw the diadem lall Iron in spite of his victories ; Charles X., in v \" ROVALTV IS ABOLISHED IX FRANCE Lhe Girondists, who tor some time had the"], [679, "PHILIPPE EGALITE.

It has been said by the defenders of the ide \" that Philippe Egalite did his best be present at the sitting of the Coin en- M. anwhile the faction of the Assembly which in the beginning of September, 1702, had, by its excited declamation and denunciation, brought about the massacre of the prisoners, was constantly attempting, in combination with other factions, to arrest some of the most in fluential member- of the majority, accuse them of treason, and bring them before the Revolu tionary Tribunal. On the 2nd of June, 171.-, they struck their first blow ; and on the 311! of October in the same year they denounced forty four deputies, ordered the arrest of seventy-one, and compelled many more to take to flight and seek safety in concealment. The majority was thus diminished by 1 50 members : the minority in fact became the majority. tion when sentence had to he passed on the unfortunate king ; but that he was threatened by hi- friend- of the Left with assassination unless ted with them for the \"death of the tyrant.\" However that may be, he took his seat among the judge- by whom the fate of his kinsman was to be decided, and, when it turn to deliver his opinion, did so in the following words : \"Occupied solely with my duty, convinced that all those who have attacked, or might afterwards attack, the sovereignty of ople deserve death, I pronounce the death nis.\" Then one of the authors of these measures, Robespierre, hoping to monopolise whatever fruits they might bear, and finding no further obstacle to his ambition, became dictator in fact, bent everything beneath his will, and reigned by terror. During fourteen months he subjected the French to a ferocious tyranny. At Paris alone thirty, forty, sixty heads fell daily. At length, on the 27th of July, 1794, this monster, together with his chief accomplices, paid his reckoning, and France was delivered from an intolerable yoke. To the general desolation, grief, and alarm now succeeded the liveliest joy. The doors of many prisons were thrown open ; the instrument of death ceased to ply its blade. Philippe Egalite had looked for general ap- ', and had voted in fear of death \u2014 which ed him all the same, and came to him in the very form in which a few months before it had been inflicted on the unhappy Louis.

Very different was the feeding excited by the Philippe Egalite in the breast of the king himself. \" I don't know by what chance,\" Edgeworth in his \"Relation sur niers Momens du Roi,\" \"the conversation fell upon Philippe.

On the 26th of October, 1705, it terminated its session. The Conventional Assembly, at war with all the States of Europe, at war even with the French inhabitants of some of the western provinces, surrounded by distractions and dangers to which some of its own members fell victims, did not omit to encourage the arts and science-, particularly tlio-e of practical utility, nor to found public institutions of the highest importance.

He led the dissipated life nong the young abbes of his day ; but he cultivated the society of intellectual men, and was on friendly term- with Mirabeau, Buffon, and Voltaire. In 1780 he was appointed Agent- General of the French clergy : a lucrative post which placed him in relations with the Minister, M. de Calonne, from whom he acquired ideas on the subject of finance which enabled him to repair his shattered fortune. Leading at the same time a life of pleasure and of affairs, Talley rand did not remain insensible to the changes that were taking place around him ; and in a letter addressed to his friend, Choiseul Gouffier, ambassador at Constantinople, he showed himself an intelligent advocate of political reform. A separate administration for the provinces \u2014 provincial self-government, in fact \u2014 was one of the remedies he proposed. He declared war again.-t all privileges, and ended his letter by observing that \"at List the people must count for something.\" In 1788, the year before the Revolution, Talleyrand was made Bishop of Autun, with an income of So, 000 franc member of the Assembly of Notables in the month of November in this year, he showed himself one ofthe warmest advocates ot the new ideas, and became at this time the friend of Neeker. The clergy of his diocese sent Talleyrand as deputy to the States-General of 1789. Here he ranged himself on the popular side, and voted for the union of the two privileged orders (nobility and clergy ) with the Tiers Etats. He voted, too, for the suppression of tithes, and for the constitution of an executive with responsible ministers. At the great Federation Festival in the Champs de Mars, it was Talleyrand who celebrated mass on the altar of the country, and a few months afterwards he gave up the bishopric ot Autun. For supporting the civil constitution of the clergy he drew upon himself a decree of excommunication. In 1701 Talleyrand under took his first diplomatic mission, being sent to London in order, if possible, to obtain a declara tion of neutrality from England. In this he was unsuccessful. The atmosphere of London, however, suited him better than that of Paris, and Talleyrand kept away from France until after the Reign of Terror. From England he had passed to the United States. But on the forma tion of the Directory he thought the time had come for him to go back to France ; and though hi- name had been placed on the list ot emigres, he had no trouble in obtaining permission to return.

AN interesting book has been published, under JT\\. the title of\" Paris Denioli,\" on the churches, house-, and buildings of various kinds which were pulled down during the work of reconstruc tion pursued so vigorously during recent years, and especially under the Second Empire. To build the Rue de Rennes, which joins the Place Saint-Germain-des-Pres to the terminus of the Left-Bank Western Railway on the Boulevard Montparnasse, it was necessary to pull down the two first houses in the Rue Taranne, numbered i ami 2. No. 2, whose side windows look out upon the Rue Saint-Benoit, afforded for many an abode, on the fifth floor, just beneath the roof, to Diderot, who, however, died, not here, but in the Rue Richelieu immediately after his return from a visit to the Empress Catherine. Son of a blacksmith and cutler at Lanj Diderot entered at an early age the colleg Harcourt, directed by the Jesuits. But shoi no aptitude for the theological career, he was placed with a lawyer, at whose office he occupied himself exclusively with the study of literature, philosophy, and mathematics. After a time the chief of the office remonstrated with him, and asked him how he expected to live. \" I am fond of study,\" he replied, \" I can on very little, I am perfectly happy ; why, then, should I trouble myself about a regular profes sion?\" On being informed of these views Diderot's father began by stopping his allowance. Then Diderot gave lessons, but it would seem, on very remunerative principles; for if the pupil pleased him he was ready to go on teaching him all day, whereas, in the contrary case, he tlid not give a second lesson. He ac cepted payment in the form of books, clothe-, or anything else which, in the absence of ni. the pupil could offer. After a time he engaged in a private family, when for three months he taught incessantly, walking out with his pupils, taking all his meals with them, and not leaving them for a moment. He disliked, however, living in another person's house, and retired after three months to hi- own garret. He was now in the direst poverty. H. often without food, and one Shrove Tuesday, in 1 741 (he was then twenty 1 he returned home in a fainting condition from having eaten nothing all day. His lam seeing his enfeebled stab, gave him steeped in wine; \"and I then swore.' Diderot afterwards to his daughter, \"that. \u00ab Fitted neither by birth nor breeding for the atmosphere of courts, Diderot received, never theless4 from the Russian empress the greatest marks' of favour. In Russia Catherine could scarcely govern otherwise than despotically, though she once summoned a parliament whose members were entrusted with legislative func tions ; and it was perhaps not altogether her fault that nothing came of their labours. Per sonally, however, she had not the despotic manners by which the intercourse of Frederick the Great with his inferiors was so often marked. Of a more accommodating disposition than Diderot, Voltaire was able for a considerable time to live peacefully with the Prussian king, though when at last the inevitable quarrel came, he did not scruple to criticise and satirise the sovereign whom, through a long course of years, he had persistently flattered."], [687, "DIDEROT'S EARLY LIFE. and Diderot.] 243 ever I possessed anything, I would not, so long as I lived, refuse help to a fellow creature who might find himself in a similar position.\" On the whole, however, apart from occasional bad days, Diderot led a lively existence. He could write in any style, and was ready to execute any kind of literary work. He even composed sermons. He wrote six for a missionary, who paid him 300 crowns (about for the half-dozen. This he afterwards declared to be one of the best strokes of business he had ever done. From time to time he wrote to his father, who did not answer him. His mother, however, sent him, from time to time, a portion of her savings by a faithful servant who, without saying anything about it, added to the amount some savings of her own. On these occasions the poor woman had to make a journey on foot of some 300 miles, 1 50 each way. In spite of this assistance Diderot was often in distress. It may be, as Heine somewhere suggests, that writers and artists, like medlars, ripen best on straw. It is certain, in any case, that the talent and courage of Diderot developed in spite, if not in con sequence, of his poverty. His energy grew in proportion as he exercised his power of nee. fell ill, and the illness -ealed his fate. He was waited upon and nursed by his two kind hearted neighbours. On his recovery he was profuse in his expressions of gratitude towards the mother ; nor did this prevent him from marrying the daughter in secret. 'Lhe young woman whom he now made his wife was more remarkable for good nature than for intelligence. The strangest stories ate told about her want of brains. Thus, on one 1 iccasit .11, when a publisher had in her presence purchased a manuscript from Diderot for 100 crowns, she expressed her astonishment at his taking so much money for a few scraps of paper, and urged him tei return the sum. About a year later Diderot, finding that injurious stories had been told to his family concerning his wife, sent her without invitation on a visit to his father, who received her with kindness, and kept her in his house for three months. Meanwhile Diderot made the acquaintance of a Mme. de Pinsieux, who, unlike the wife, was more remarkable for intellectual than for moral qualities. She was ex travagant in her tastes, and to gratify them Diderot plied his pen with ceaseless activity. To furnish her with money, literary spend thrift that he was, he wrote books ofthe most varied kinds, from \" Pensees Philosophiqucs,\" one of his most admirable works, to \" Les Bijoux IndiscTcts,\" one of the most objectionable. No one complained of the licentious tale. But the philosophical work, a pamphlet of some sixty pages, full of profound truths, expressed with vivacity and originality, was first attributed to Voltaire, and next burnt by the common hang man. In his \" Letter on the Blind,\" Diderot gave further offence, and this time he was imprisoned in the castle of Vincennes. Everyone thought that the materialism professed by Diderot in his essay was the cause of his arrest ; which, how ever, was due to something quite different. His \" Lettre sur les Aveugles \" had been written on the occasion of an operation for cataract per formed by Reaumur on a patient who had been blind from birth. Diderot had wished to study the first sensations produced upon the blind man by the effect of light ; but the famous operator would admit no one except a lady of fashion, Mme. Dupre de Saint-Maur ; and at the be ginning of his letter Diderot complained of the man of science who had preferred to have his experiment witnessed by two beautiful eyes rather than by men capable of appreciating it.

As an example of the laxity, as well as the seventy of the period, it may be mentioned that when Diderot had once been set free from the dungeon, he was allowed, in his more commodious place of residence, to receive not only his wife and friends, but also Mme. de Pinsieux, to whom he was still attached. One day, when sh."], [689, "and Diderot.] THE \u00ab' ENCYCLOP\u00c6DIA.\" visiting him, he was struck by the brilliancy of her attire. She accounted for the elaborateness of her toilette by saying that she was going to an entertainment at Champigny. \" Was she going alone ?\" he asked. \" Quite alone.\" \"Your metaphysics to the frame of a weaver, and thence to the drama.\" \"Centuries after the time of his existence,\" wrote Rousseau, in his \" Confessions,\" when he had quarrelled with him, \"this universal head will be looked upon word of honour .-1 \" 1 it you.\" Diderot did not quite believe in the lady's assurances, and soon after her de parture he climbed over the wall of the park, hurried to Champigny, and there saw Mine, de Pinsieux with some ad mirer.

I tin not know whether they (Grimm and Diderot) are getting tired of St. Petersburg, but I know that I could talk to them all my life without fatigue.\" Diderot and Voltaire it could scarcely, indeed, have been otherwise, though it was not the direct object of the writers to make war upon Faith. Among the many celebrated authors who furnished articles to the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia\" Rousseau may in particular be mentioned. But like most of the contributors he wrote only for a time, and chiefly on musical subjects. D'Alem bert, Voltaire, Rousseau, all fell off; Rousseau because something had offended him, Voltaire to write his own philosophical dictionary, D'Alem bert because he had grown tired of the work. \"I am worn out with the vexations of all kinds brought upon us by this work,\" wrote D'Alem bert to Voltaire in 1758. At one time its publication was forbidden, when Catherine II. offered to continue it in Russia. The volumes were, curiously enough, thrown into the Ba-tille ; which, since they could be taken out again, was at least better than burning them at the hands of the common hang man. Catherine did her best to keep Diderot at St. Petersburg ; but he wished to return to ! and though he had been invited to stai al Berlin by Frederick the Great, he passed through Prussia without visiting the capital. It has been before said that he had no sympathy for Frederick. Soon after his return to Paris he was taken ill, and after a short malady died. The cure ol Saint-Roch had come to see him, and Diderot received him in a very friendly manner. They talked on various moral and religious subjects, and as they agreed on many theological points, especially as to the efficacy of charity and good works, the cure ventured to suggest that if he would authorise the publication of these opinions, together with a retractation of his works, the effect would be excellent. But Diderot would do nothing of the kind. Neither would he confess. Nevertheless there was but little difficulty in connection with his funeral, which took place at Saint-Roch, where he was buried (July, 17S4) in the Chapel of the Virgin. There his remains still lie. Catherine II. granted Diderot a handsome pension, and she at the same time purchased his library for a large sum. The empress went so far, indeed, a- to -end him the sum of 50,000 francs, being the annual pension paid in advance for fifty years. Touched by the bounty of Catherine, Diderot wished to thank the empress in person, and in the year 1773 he started for Russia.

The venerable prelate expired on the -7th, two days after he had been struck. \" May my blood be the last shed \" were his dying words. The successful insurrection of June, which, after much slaughter, was suppressed, was partly the consequence of the successful insurrection of February, after which, Louis Philippe haying taken flight, the Second Republic was proclaimed. In February the provisional Government had guaranteed in a formal manner the \" right to labour.\" Accordingly, numbers of workmen being without employment, and capitalists being unwilling to embark in new enterprises, or even in many cases to continue those which were already on foot, national workshops were opened, in which upwards of 100,000 workmen found occu pation and bread. Apart from the drain upon the exchequer caused by the employment of these hundred thousand men, the inevitable moment at which it would be necessary to close the workshops was regarded by everyone with alarm. L^ach workman was emplt lyed one day out of four in useless labour ; and the more prudent hoped that the national workshops would be closed gradually, and the men induced gradually to seek service with private employers. Among other measures it was proposed to colonise Algeria with the men out of work ; and it was calculated that two hundred millions of francs would be necessary for this purpose. According to the calculations of many wise economists and politicians, an expenditure of two hundred millions in order to get rid of a menacing army of 100,000 men was not excessive. Others, including, it may be, some secret enemies of the Republic, who did not object to a violent collision, in which the republican form of govern ment might disappear, thought the workshops ought to be closed, ami the men left to shift for themselves.

The height of the so-called \"mount\" is on a level with that of the roof of the railway station ; but the rail way line is itself considerably above the level of the boulevard. The region of Mount Par nassus has its theatre and its cemetery.

During the cholera year of 1832 he was carried in a state of exhaustion, caused solely- by hunger, to the ho-pital of La Charite, where, in the hope of catching the epidemic and dying of it, he rolled himself up in the sheets of a cholera patient who had but lately expired. Contagion, how ever, spared him, and wanting nothing but food and rest he was soon restored to health. On leaving the hospital he walked on foot to his native town of Provins, where, such was the unpractical character of his mind, he not only started a journal, but a journal in verse. Diogenes it was called, and his only reason for starting it in the little town of Provins, where it could not possibly find a sufficient number of readers, seems to have been that he had influence and credit at a local printing-office, where he had at one time been employed as proof-reader. Diogenes had doubtless been suggested by the Nemesis of BartheTemy, which, however, was published not in a little provincial town, but at Paris. Only a iew numbers of Diogenes ap peared ; and in his rage at not being appreciated the satirist filled his dying number with the bitterest attacks on leading inhabitants of the town. This led to a duel, and obliged him once more to quit Provins for Paris. It is related ed Hegesippe Moreau that in the revolutionary days of 1830, fighting at the barricades, he wounded a Swiss soldier, and then, taking pity on the man, gave him his own coat, to enable him to get away in disguise. Let us pass, however, to a writer enjoying far more celebrity than either the graceful poet Hegesippe .Moreau or the grotesque historio grapher, Father Loriquet. It was probably from his English mother that Sainte-Beuve derived that taste for certain English poets, with Cowper, Wordsworth, and Shelley among them, whom he attempted to imitate in his earliest flights. His mother, having been left a widow, sent him for preliminary study to the College ot Boulogne, his native town ; afterwards trans ferring him, for the completion of his general education, to Paris.

But after waiting for a year as assistant-physician at the hospital of Saint-Louis, he felt that he had missed his true vocation, and, without com pletely abandoning medicine, wrote a series of historical, philosophical, and critical articles for the Globe, directed at that time by M. Dubois, formerly one of his professors. Sainte-Beuve was then living in the Rue de Vaughan!, a few doors from the house inhabited by Victor Hugo; and when the latter changed his abode and installed himself in the Rue Notre-Dame-des- Champs, accident once more threw Sainte-Beuve within easy distance of the poet. Community of literary taste produced tin intimate acquaint ance between the neighbours, and Sainte-Beuve took part in the new intellectual movement of which Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas were the originators and chiefs. 'Lhe New School, breaking from classical traditions, turned back its attention to the sixteenth century, and to a group of writer- greatly obscured by the literary lustre of the two centuries which followed. Sainte-Beuve set himself to study Ronsard and Du Bellay ; and in due time he had an opportunity of showing that he had not studied them in vain. The Academy having, in 1827, proposed as the subject of its Prize for Eloquence a \" Picture of French Poetry in the Sixteenth Century,\" Daunou persuaded the critic of the Globe to compete, and placed at the young mail's disposition his own rich library. Sainle- Bcuvc's essay did not gain the prize. But it wa- published by its author, who printed with it an edition of the \" Selected Works \" of Ronsartl ; and the work, which the Academy hail rejected, took rank ultimately as the first authority on the period of French literature with which it deals. some specimens. Having once taken up with romanticism, Sainte-Beuve went tit least as his master, and committed precisely those faults which he had censured ; for eccentric lines, pi phrases, and outrageous metaphors abound in his collection, although these eccentricitii . injuring the volume, seem to have caused its success. People who liked everything that was odd or audacious read the book, and praised faults at which scholars would knit their brow-. The Revolution of 1830 opened a new sphere of activity to Sainte-Beuve. Hitherto he had occupied himself little with politics; but now he plietl his pen freely in the Globe as a supporter of those principles of humanitarianism championed by Pierre Leroux, who bail become director of the journal in question. Subsequently he undertook a political campaign in the Na, with Armand Carrel. In his various wri both in and out of the newspapers, he showed himself inconstant to any fixed principles. His whole life, in fact, was composed of intellectual changes and variations. These, however, were simply the outcome of a mind curious to 1 . all kinds of ideas, to penetrate within them, iu order to extract Irom them their sap or their honey. Approaching the teachers in order to appreciate them as well as their doctrim made himself their pupil, sat at their feet. quitted them as soon as he had completed his analysis.

Whilst throwing himself into romanticism Sainte-Beuve was not blind to the defects of the New School, though he could not himself, as poet, avoid the very faults against which he had warned others. In reference to Victor Hugo's \"iiile- and Ballads\" he wrote as follows: \"M.

In the first place they have found it necessary to borrow our English word for their pastimes ; and their spelling of sportsman as \"sport man\" is somewhat indicative of their generally unsuccessful imitation of English sports. The French are themselves conscious of the failure of this imitation. \"Sport,\" says a French writer, \" is an English word which signifies literally relaxation, distraction, anel which the English employ, by extension, to designate the pleasures to which powerful aristocrats or opulent citizens abandon themselves as a re laxation from the serious labours of political life or the absorbing occupations of commerce. In \"sport\" they include large hunts and shooting expeditions such as can be practised on vast estates, together with betting, which invoices millions of pounds sterling, riding and driving, fencing, boxing, swimming, skating ; everything which calls into play the forces and energy of the body, to the too frequent neglect of mental activity. \" We have adopted the word and attempted the thing. But independently of the fact that our French society lacks some- of the fundamental conditions which, in this respect, English society possesses, we have done what imitators gener ally do : we have diminished, sometimes even travestied the model. Large aristocratic hunts have become impossible on our democratic and parcelled-out soil. Well-bred horses cost a great deal of money, and the instability of fortunes is an obstacle to fine stables. The most reckless of our millionaires only hazard a few thousand francs in the way of bets, and it is now generally understoi id that when a \" louis \" is spoken of on the turf, the ambitious word must be translated into the more modest expression, \" twenty sous.\" . . . Even fencing is aban doned to fiction and the stage. Duellists who are at all serious must go beyond the frontier to find a ground which will place combatants and seconds beyond the reach of the French law. ddie police-court of the nineteenth century is perhaps more dreaded than was the scaffold of Richelieu.\" Parisian summers, this same writer goes i observe, are on the whole too cold for bathing, and Parisian winters too hot for skating. Unquestionably horse-racing has taken a certain hold on the French, though it is true that the crowds who frequent the most popular races do not confine their attention, or their con versation, to the horses or the stakes, but n the event principally as a tete. It is at the hippodrome of the Bois de Boulogne (or Longchamps, as it is also called) that the most largely attended races occur. A minimum charge of a franc is made for admission, to stand or walk about outside the ropes which mark off the course. For the reserved places hi^licr prices are charged: five francs to the pavilions, twenty francs to the weighing enclosure, fifteen francs for a one-horse carriage, twenty francs for a carriage with more than one hoi on. The races of La Marche are in the sunn of steeple-chases. ddie Chateau ele La Marche stanels in a park at a short distance from Ville d'Avray and Saint-Cloud ; and it is in the park that the races take place. The races of the Bois de Vincennes an fashionable than those of Longchamps and ul La .Marche, perhaps because the approach tu Vincennes through crowded streets is less at tractive- than the drive through the Champs Elysees and the Bois de Boulogne. Idle races of Chantilly, founded in 1834 under the patronage of the Dukes of Orleans and of Nemours, are run twice a year on the spacious meadows which extend right and left of the magnificent stables ot the chateau of the Condes. The first races are fixed for the second fortnight of May. The later series, those of the autumn niecthr. held in September and October. The last 1 the season is for the grand prize ot the .1 Club. The racecourse of Chantilly describes"], [699, "BOOK-COLLECTING. Sports and Diversions.] 255 an ellipsis measuring some metres. Several stands have been erected opposite the stables : prices of admission to the various places as at At Chantilly are the principal training establishments. The Versailles races are run on the plain of . where Napoleon III. held some of his most brilliant reviews. They take place in May and June. At Fontainebleau the races are run on a course cut through the part of the forest known as Hey of the Solle. From various woody heights the spectator, well protected from the sun, can obtain an excellent view of the running. ting is practised at a club in the little town genteuil, close to Paris, where the society risian Riflemen is established. Candidates duly proposed and seconded are put up for m, and, if admitted, pay ten francs entrance money and an annual subscription of fifty francs. The organ of the society is the well-known sport ing paper, the Journal des Chasseurs. The canotiers and canotieres of the Seine are counted by thousands. They all seem to row more for amusement than for exercise and pace, ddie principal ports of the Parisian navy are Charenton above bridge, and Asnieres below. Charenton may be reached by the Lyons Rail way : the charming Asnieres (famous for its balls) by the Saint-Germain and Versailles line. The water-side restaurants are organised in view of the canotiers, and appeal specially to this floating population. If the Seine is remarkable for its swimming baths and, at some little distance on each side of Paris, for its innumerable boats with rowers and rowed in gay fantastic costumes, one bank of the Seine, the left, is celebrated for its stalls nd-hand books. It was at a curiosity shop he quays of the left bank that Balzac's \"Peaude Chagrin\" or \"Chagreen Skin\" was offered ( It was at a neighbouring bookstall that or student in the \" Vie de Boheme \" sold 1 ek books for little more than the price of paper in order to buy medicine for the 'lying mistress of his friend.

When he had once found the Martial of Sweynheym and Pannartz dated 1475 he went straight back to London. Such a passion looks like insanity ; but it is at least a respectable, innocent kind of madness. To have a genuine passion for books is to care neither for cards, nor for good living, nor for useless luxury, nor for race-horses, nor for political intrigues, nor for ruinous love affairs. The bibliophile is never troubled by the storms of political life. Pixericourt, the author of thirty amusing or terrible novels, would be forgotten in France but for the rare editions that he collected in his library, and which after his death did more for his reputation, at the sale of his books, than all his works of fiction had done. Few writers of the day grudged him his talent or his success ; but many envied him his \" Imitation of Jesus Christ,\" given to the monk Laurence \"by his very humble servant, Pierre Corneille.\" His Elzevirs and Basker villes, for which Holland and China had fur nished their rarest paper, England and France their best engravers, Russia and Morocco their incomparable leather, filled amateurs with enthusiasm. A great French book-collector, Grolier, had adopted this motto, \" For myself and my friends.\" Charles Nodier wrote for Pixericourt an epigraph to be inscribed inside his books which, if somewhat selfish, was at least true : Tel est le triste sort de tout livre pr. Souvent il est perdu, toujours il est gate* The bookstall-keeper acquires gradually a knowledge of the finest or, if not the finest, the most curious editions; and he would be but a poor dealer were he unable to judge of their value. At one time the Pont-Neuf was full of bookshops ; and the second-hand dealers in books had their stalls in the Cite, close to Notre Dame and to the Palace of Justice, as well as on the Place de Greves. But they are now nearly all to be found on the parapets of the left bank. ddie picture-dealers, at one time numerous on the quays of the left bank of the Seine, have for years past been gradually disappearing.

They are generally gay, good-natured, well meaning fellows, devoted body and soul to their pupils, especially to those pupils who have done them the honour to kill someone in mortal combat. Their weak point is said to be vera city ; not on all occasions, but whenever they have the foil in hand. \"I have never,\" says M. Legouve, \"met a single fencer who would not \u2014 say mice every year \u2014 deny that he- had been touched when the hit was palpable. It is so easy to say 'I did not feel it,' and a hit not i used does not count. Ah, if we dramatists could only annul hisses by saying: 'I did not hear them ! ' \" My first professor,\" continues M. Legouve, \" was an old master known as Pere Dularviez. He had a daughter of whom he was exceed ingly proud. She was employed in a milliner's shop, which caused her father some uneasiness as to her possible conduct. There was nothing to justify his uneasiness, but he was uneasy. At last, unable to rest, he wrapped himself up in a cloak and took up his posit; the corner of the Rue Traversiere, close to the Rue Saint-Honore, where his daughter worked.

It does, indeed, demand practice, anil long practice ; but that is not sufficient, it must be your vocation : you must be born a fencer, just tts you must be born an artist. And then, when the apprenticeship has been served, what pleasure is enjoyed ! I doubt whether there is in external life a single act in which a man feels himself to live more fully than in a vigorous assault. M. Legouve1, who, besides being an admirable writer, possesses no superficial knowledge ol fencing, next proceeds to ti few detailed observa tions on the art of the foil and its profi We can hardly do better than preserve hi- own words. \"Fencing,\" he says, \"has undergone during the last half-century the same revolution as poetry, music, and painting. It ha- had its romantic period and its contending schools. \" Look at the fencer in action. Each member, each muscle is stretched, and each for a different purpose. Whilst the hand glances rapidly and lightly, always tending forwards, the body holds itself back, and the legs, vigorously contracted like a spring, await, for their extension, the signal to be given by the arm as it prepares to make its sudden thrust. The whole of the members are like so many obedient soldiers to whom the general says: ' March ' \u2014 ' Halt ' \u2014 'Double.' The general is the head, that head which, at once inspired and calculating as though on a real field of battle, detects at a glance tin faults of the enemy, laws traps for him and compels him to fall into them, simulates a retreat ill order to give him confidence, and returns suddenly upon him with a frightful assault. \"'Lhe distinguishing characteristics of the old school were rigidity, grace, and a certain academic elegance. The words themselvi press the thing. To practise fencing \"a- to \u2022go to the Academy.' A fencer of thi school could not run to the attack, nor sud denly break off. He neither bent dim: sprang forward, but under all circumstances maintained, more or less, the same attitude. Fencing was in those days, above all thin art ; which, like every art. had the beautiful for aim. \"Very different was the system of the new school. To make hits wa- it- one object.

I 'tnard and Charlemagne were the two last ntatives of the old school : Roussel and the two first of the new one. I have had the honour, in my youth, of fencing with all and I do not hesitate to say that, in my m, while fully recognising the incomparable quickness of Lozes, the superiority rested alto gether with the representatives ofthe old school. Fencing ran the risk not of being renewed, like poetry, in another form, but of being lost alto gether, at least as an art. Then came forw ard nig man who combined in himself the op- qualities of the two schools. Every lover of fencing will understand that I am referring to Bertrand. As rapid as Lozes and as regular as id, he borrowed from romanticism its audacity, its inspiration, its occasional rashness, and preserved at the same time the elegance of bearing, the severity of attitude, the caution and the science of the classical school. He may fairly be said, in company with Cordelois and Pons the elder, to have saved the art of fencing. He is an exceptional fencer among exceptional fencers. It I may be allowed to use the ex pression, there is genius in his art. The fencing masters who came next were the products, some what mixed, of the three schools; the four professors who figure in the first rank being MM. Robert the elder, Gate-chair, .Mimiague, and Pons the younger. Robert has a quickness of hand, an accuracy of attitude, and a rapidity of reply which recalls Bertrand. Gate-chair is the most academic of the masters of the present day. There is, however, something a little theatrical in his elegance and in his imposing carriage. \".Mimiague is supple, insinuating, adroit, sure to profit by every opportunity. '1 'here is a sort of cajolery in his play. If you ask who is the best of these four professors, I shall recommend you to apply the test of Themistocdes. Bring together the principal fencing-masters of Paris, and ask them to write on a slip of paper file names of the two best fencers in Paris. Each of them will give the first vote to himself ; but Robert will have all the second votes : from which I conclude that he deserves the first.\" CHAPTER XXXVIII. PETTV TRADES.

The first person who picked up, on the highway, a cigar-end, and then another and another, and who, after chopping them all up, sold the results as smoking-tobacco, did not deliberately adopt this profession in the same way that a person bed imes an administrator or a lawyer. It was the necessity of eating that launched him into this career. Presently he held this argument, based upon statistics : \u2014 Every day in Paris at least three hundred thousand cigars are smoked. There must, therefore, be somewhere, and par ticularly beneath the outdoor tables ofthe boule vard cafes, three hundred thousand fag-ends. Thus the horizon opens to him. He perceives a magnificent commercial enterprise and takes"], [706, "PARIS, OLD AXD NEW [Petty Trades. partners. A new kind of manufacturer has now come into being: a manufacturer of unlicensed tobacco.\" Apparently the commodity sells well ; anel in the retort of a pipe the eclectic composition is as agreeable to the taste as the privileged product of the imperial factories. Some of the contraband dealers in cigar-ends have made a small fortune. It was simply chance which created the \" day- ddie chief quality requisite in this aM sobriety. We were speaking just now- of the man win. collects cigar-ends. Another curious picker-upol unconsidered trifles is the man who is alwa the look-out for crusts of bread. A crust oi bread is found in all sorts of places : in the street, at the corners of lanes and alleys, on heal rubbish. Do not imagine that this man, on the hunt for hard, dirty, disgusting piece banker \" or \" banquier a la journee.\" Thirty or forty years ago an individual named Poildeloup, living in the quarter of the markets, lent five francs one day to a woman dealing in old clothes, on condition that she should return him the same evening five francs ten centimes. She kept her word, and again bor rowed from him. Then other tradeswomen, also out of funds, applied to Poildeloup, who at once saw what a profit he might derive from this daily lend ing organised on a big scale, ddie two sous brought to him each evening in ex cess ot the five francs lent in the morning looked less than nothing at first sight ; but in fifty days the banker doubled his capital, and in a few years had amassed wealth. Later on, rival has fallen so low as to be obliged to live on the fruits of his discoveries. He is the sort of person who believes firmly that nothing in this world is lost, and that one morsel of dry bread, added to another, may be the beginning of a sack of fragments which he will be able ti for some twenty sous to breeders of rabbits, ddie rabbit, beloved by the frequenters of barrier taverns, does not feed on grain and cabbage alone. It also eats a good quan tity of bread. It is in order to procure it this article of diet that the trade of crust-collector was invented. Of the ragpicker mention has been made elsi He is essentially eclectic in his tastes : rags, paper, gloves, glass, broken toys, the OLD-CLOTHtS LlEALEt necks of bottles, nothing comes amiss to him. He puts into the basket he carries on his shoulder whatever he can find. It is the trieur or suiter whom the classification of the different objects concerns. Another petty trade which should not be for gotten is that of the old-clothesman, who i everywhere early in the morning uttering his piercing and well-known cry.

These day bank-, content with half the interest charged by the inventor of the business, still do an excellent trade. t )ne of the most interesting of the small pro fessions is that of the \"guardian angel.\" This ethereal personage conducts drunkards home to their dwellings. Attached to every large Paris tavern is a guardian angel, whose duty it is to escort any late-staying customer whose legs decline their office, anel who needs a guide. He must not quit the person entrusted to his until the latter is out of the reach of thieves and safely installed in his own I"], [707, "THE OLD-CLOTHES.MAX. Petty Trades.] 261 of their wardrobe. It is, above all, when the Carnival is going on that he does good business. The allowance from home being insufficient for st ofthe masked ball, with its concomitant expenses, he realises money by the stile, now of alight overcoat, now of some other summer varment which can be dispensed with in the depths of winter. If the old-clothesman is waiting for the student, the student is on the impecunious position, sold them back again to Jules. In the Temple, which gives its name to one of the lower boulevards, there was formerly a market for all kinds of antiquities, including old clothes ; while buying and selling of a like character was carried on until a later period in the Marche des Patriarches.

Nor must the sellers of violets at one sou the bunch be forgotten ; though they are not to be confoundc-el with the bouquetiere in a far more fashionable walk i if life, ddie dealers in groundsel, too, have a trade of their own. There are many institutions, professions, anil classes which, after being originated on the left hank, have crossed the water to flourish on the right. Among these must be included the claque : though, from whatever quarter it may have sprung, there is now no theatrical district in Paris where it does not thrive.

But though he now surpassed himself in the ingenuity of his man\u0153uvres, the work he produced did not succeed. Thereupon he lost all credit. The authors and actors resolved to tio without him. His sceptre fell, but only to be taken from time to time by others, Up to this time the claque, as before said, was the work of enterprising individuals who 01 isetl it on certain occasions, but not continuously as tt permanent institution. Figaro, in Beaumar chais's coined}', speaks of the play he had written, and goes on to say : \"I really cannot understand how it was that I tlitl not obtain the go success ; for I had filled the pit with excellent workmen, whose hands were like wood.\" Another writer on the same subject, M. Prudhomme, tells us in his \"Historical and Critical Mirror of Old and New Paris\" (1^07) that he had once been acquainted with a man who had no means of living but by assisting tit first representations. Placed in the middle of the pit, he called attention to the beauties of the piece and led the applause. The name ot \"Monsieur Claque\" had been given to him, and he had hands as hard as the piece of wood with which washerwomen beat their linen. His terms were thirty-six francs if the piece succeeded, and twelve franc- if it failed. The organisation of the claque, as a permanent institution, dates from the time of Napoleon I., and seems to have had for its starting-point the 1. no. .us rivalry between Mile. Duchenoi Mile. Georges. When the struggle between the two tragic actresses came to an end, the I organised in their service declined to be dis banded. They elected their chiefs, and the leaders treated with managers and authors toi regular support. People were still found who would applaud a favourite actor or actress Irom enthusiasm, duly stimulated by a gratuitous ticket. Thus at one time the whole atelier ot David served as claque to an actress much admired by the painter and his pupils, who without support and encouragement might have been crushed, it was thought, by the growing talent and popularity of Mile. Mars. The claque of David's atelier was a formidable one, for the great artist had from sixty to eighty students attached to him. Thi- was in t8l0, a year or two after the publication ot the \" Historical and Critical Mirror of Old and New Paris\" previously referred to. The claque, however, did not acquire its greatest importance until the time of the Restoration. At an earlier period Dorat, a popular drawing-room poet, or writer of vers dc socictc, was in the habit of sending persons to the theatre with a free-admission on the under standing that they were to applaud his piece. By this stratagem he managed to secure a run i if several nights for more than one of his works ; but at each success he might have applied to himself the exclamation of Pyrrhus after the Battle of Asculum : \"One more such victory and I am ruined.\" Dorat did, indeed, ruin himself at the game he is said to have invented; but his invention was not lost to posterity. The claque, however, did not work, in these comparatively primitive days, as an organised body. There was a certain Chevalier tie la .Morliere, ti retired musketeer,"], [709, "THE CLAOUE. Petty 1 263 Under the Restoration the claque wa- a regular institution. 'Lhe quarrels of the Rom anticists and Classicists lent it a considerable\" importance. Impartial in its tastes, it served, turn by turn, and with the same zeal, the \"Antony\" of the modern drama and the Greek heroine- of ancient tragedy. Since 1830 its authority has been universally accepted. Several directors, after^rying to dispense with it, have been obliged to conciliate it and accept its conditions when the directors have driven it from their house, it has always been brought back by the vanity ofthe comedians. One alone ofthe Pan- theatres preserved itself from the claque. the now defunct Theatre Italien ; though people say of this house that if it had not a claque it had a clique. sob like children. ddie thing becomes con tagious. The whole female portion of the audience are now, perhaps, like Niobe, all tear.-, and the newspapers next day declare that the performance was a succes de /armes. Doubtless this charlatanism has its comic side. But it is repulsive at the same time ; for false hood is the foundation of the system, and, as M. F!ugene Despois says: \"It is sad to see men almost exclusively occupied in lying reci procally. People say that it is only life, that you must conform to it, and that it imposes on no one. ' Who is deceived? Everyone agl the system,' they argue, ddiat i. true. No one is duped ; but of what use is all this comedy? After all, of the two parts, that played by the claqueurs, often with spirit, to dupe the public, and that played by the public who submit to this impudent mystification and daily pretend to be duped, the most shameful is that of the public.\" Of recent years the claque has been made the object of some very lively attacks by writers who understand the dignity of their profession A certain number of dramatic authors, Emile Augier and Dumas the younger amongst others, have frequently endeavoured to dispense with its mercenary plaudits ; but it must be owned that the vanity i if a large proportion of the acti irs, and in particular of the actresses, has frustrated the- reform. In the meantime, ere the theatre world has awakened to the dishonourable character of the claque system, the claqueurs gri >\\\\ fat, and in some cases possess their town and country residences. It is true that not everyone can be a chief of the claque ; to conquer, or rather to purchase, that important post, a great deal of money is required. Auguste, formerly chief of the claque at the Opera, paid So.ooo francs for his position, but in a few years he had made his fortune-. \"More than one well-estab lished dancer paid him a pension,\" says Dr. Veron. \"ddie debut of each artist brought him a gratuity pri ipi irl i< mate ti i the artist's pretensii ins. Towards the end of an engagement and the moment of its renewal more than one singer or actor, in order to deceive at once the public and the director, goes to the Auguste of his theatre- and offers him a bag of gold to pro duce such a paroxysm of applause as shall result in a large inen ilary. Such are the traps laid for the director ; and into these traps, shrewel as he may be, he sometimes inevitably falls.\" Dr. Ve n ui, an experienced impresarii i, is far fri un denouncing the claque, which, according to him, With the exception ofthe last-named, all the theatre- of Paris have for years past had or gani-ed claques, that ofthe Opera being the best disciplined. The chiefs of the claques give theni- the title of \" undertakers of dramatic They do not receive a subvention from die \"directors,\" but a certain number of each night, which they sell for their own benefit. It is not from the tickets, however, that they derive the bulk of their gains. Some ot them make twenty or thirty thousand francs a year ; but they derive this from the vanity of the actors, who pay them proportionately to the \"t applause required. Lhe claque consists of the chief and a number generally poor wretches with a m tor the theatre, some of whom are ad mitted tree on condition of contributing as much applause as necessary, while others tire admitted simply at a reduced price.

One ot these \" knights of the chandelier,\" as they are familiarly called, has published his reminiscences, entitled, \"Memoirs of a Claqueur, containing the theory and prac tice of the art of obtaining success, by Robert i i, formerly chief of the Dramatic In surance Company, Paris, 1829.\" But whatever may be said against it, the claque is great anil, in France at least, will prevail. Nor can it be denied that in some instances ai some individuals it imposes opinions which but for its authority would not be accepted. There is an old fable of a man who, standing market-place, was approached by a man leading a pig. \"Do you want to buy this sheep ? \" the proprietor of the animal. \" It is a pig,\" was the reply. \" Nothing ofthe kind ; I can assure you your eyes deceive you,\" returned tin man. At that moment a third person came up, and, looking at the quadruped, saitl to its owner, \" How much do you want for that sheep ? \" 'I lie man to whom it had first been offered with surprise, and supposed that the third 1 was out of his mind ; but when a fourth, fifth, and sixth person had come up and likewise demanded the price of that \" sheep,\" he came to the conclusion that his own eyes must beat fault, and bought the animal as mutton. 'Lhe- business of the claque is to theatrical pig as a theatrical sheep\u2014 and it sometimes succeeds. Different opinions are entertained in thea trical circles as to the utility of the claque, some contending that it is indispensable, while others take a higher view, and hold that the work represented and the actors representing it may advantageously be allowed to stand upon their own merits. Meanwhile, apart from the claque maintained at all the Paris theatres by the management, there are often special claques which tue paitl by leading members of the company, jealous of one another's reputation. This is looked upon lw the company generally as unfair, and the practice is never avowed. Even in London, especially (if not exclusively) tit the opera, a number of energetic men may sometimes ii.. -ecu \u2014 and, above all, heard \u2014 working together with a view to the success of some particular \u25a0\u25a0 artist.\" The claqueurs \u2014 at least, at the opera \u2014 are usually Italians, from the shops of the Italian wine merchants and dealers in macaroni, vermicelli, truffles, and olives in the neighbour hood of Soho.

It was on one of the quays of the left bank that the old curiosity simp stood, so picturesquely described by Balzac, in which the I the\"Peau de Chagrin,\" who had entered the shop merely to pass the time until it should be dark enough for him to throw himself from the Pont Neuf without attracting too much attention, purchased his fatal talisman. Thirty or forty years ago Paris contained ids of antique little shops or covered stalls, of which now very few specimens remain. They were painted wooden structures, six feet high by three feet broad, picturesquely situated at the corners of squares or public monuments, side of churches or city houses, with plank hrough which a stove-chimney protruded, and with the street pavement for their floor. The extermination of these quaint establish ments necessarily accompanied the general im provement of the city ; they were an eyesore when the thoroughfares had become elegant. By degrees the- keepers of these huts, who were once the gaiety and life of the streets, disappeared. They took refuge for the most part in overcrowded which had escaped the pickaxe of the architectural improver, though this removal was 'inly a prelude to their final departure. These shopkeepers were often intellectually su perior to the proprietors of the finest shops on the boulevard, for many a scholar who found that the art or science to which he had sacrificed his lite proved ungrate fid, would for the sake of his daily bread set up in one of these street huts as a\"public writer,\" there, as set forth in a previous chapter, writing love-letters for domestic servants oms who could not express the sentiments of their bosom with a pen. Schoolmasters without pupils, students who had been plucked at their examinations, and professors without chairs, formed a large proportion of this hut inhabiting population. Amongst these primitive establishments were a number of fried-potato shops, which were d by street urchins in quest of the traditional halfpennyworth of fritters. In the Rue de la Vieille-Estrapade flourished a shop well known under the sign or title of the \" Lucky- Fork.\" Here might be beheld an enormous metal cauldron, in which constantly simmered a dark-coloured broth of somewhat too odoriferous a character. Floating in this gigantic tossed hither and thither by the bubbling of the hot liquid, were pieces of tripe, pork, and other even less inviting viands, which the customer had to make a stab at with a sharp fork of huge dimensions. Vet although the aspect of these- establishments was not altogether ap petising, cleanliness was by no means a quality in which they were deficient. For a halfpenny the consumers had the privilege of a stab with the fork. The patrons of these shops were numerous and varied : porters, workmen, stu dents, tinkers, artists. The poet Bcrthauld, author of the \" Fille du Peuple,'' was famed for his skill with the weapon in question ; Chartelet the painter and Fourier the philosopher fre quently tried their hand with it, not to mention other votaries of the arts and sciences who, unknown at that time, were destined to become celebrated. It used to be a source of great amusement to watch the customers, whatever their traele or profession might be, as, with keen gaze, they awaited some unusually big morsel which was floating towards thein, and then suddenly made a thrust at it like eel-spearers. ddie piece of meat, incessantly dancing and revolving as it was, frequently eluded the prongs of the fork, whereupon cries of irony would escape from the attentive crowd ; but when, at the first stab \u2014 for a halfpenny, that is t,, say\u2014 one of the combatants had secured a bulky morsel, this victor paraded through the ranks of the spectators, who, as they made way for him, applauded vocifen tusly.

There was a bird-shop on the island of Saint Louis where the feathered stock wa- con fided to the care of two enormous white cats, besides other like establishments, un provided with cats, which were numerous enough in that space which is to-day occupied by the square ofthe Louvre. Then there were cobblers who, within their little pavement cabins, had no hills to deliver, no rent to pay, no reproaches to bear, no masters whose caprices must be humoured, since their toil from one hour to an other produced immediate payment. The spirit of independence which was a characteristic ot artists ill leather dated back, indeed, to ancient times. Simon of Athens, the friend of Socrates and the author of the thirty-three dia logue-, in which a system of philosophy is set forth with great lucidity, received from Pericles an invitation to quit his shop and go to live with that magnate. \" I would not sell my liberty for all the treasures in Greece,\" was the reply. love- of literary works, together with a certain fund of satire which attracted men of letters towards him. ddie most celebrated Paris cobbler of the eighteenth century was Henry Sellier, whosi shop stood in the Rue Quoquereau, to-day the Rue Coq-Heron. ddiis shop was a vile hut ol rotten planks, the roof of which, a piece o cloth held up by a couple of broom-handles, was riddled like a sieve. Nevertheless, tbe proprietor wrote spirited verse, and the success of his poems was such that Louis XIV. received a copj ol them, together with their author, in his chateau at Fontainebleau. ddie- effusions of Sellier, more over, gained the approbation of Fontenelle, whose good opinion brought them greatly into fashion, and even excited the jealousy of contcnip poetasters. One of Sellier's critics published ,i couplet charging him with being assisted by famous collaborators ; to which the cobbler, who, whether poet or not, was always ready with a repartee, penned in reply another couplet to the effect that the absence of wit and every other quality from the verses of his accuser sufficiently proved that he, at least, wrote everything himself. In 1789 the cobbler's shop promptly and proudly bore aloft the tricolour cockade ; it became a rendezvous for patriots, and a political cabinet in which more than one great popular resolution was passed. When the legislative assembly hail declared that the country was \"in danger,\" all the young shoemakers hastened to enlist ; the paternal artists in leather offered their children to France. In those battalioi volunteers which were sometimes disdainfully described as an army of \" vagabonds, tailors and cobblers,\" the last-named contingent, a numer ous one, fought heroically enough. Under the Restoration ihe hut of the cobbler was a political anel secret rendezvous lor the Bonapartists and the Republicans. .Much whis pering and much writing went mi there ; many a song, penned by a literary cobbler, issued th in manuscript, to travel rapidly from workshop to workshop and inflame the political sentin of partisans.

In the famous Constitution of 1703, which was never put in force the UNDER the ancient Monarchy journalism could scarcely be said to exist in France, and the censorship exercised over books was so severe that all political works of a critical char acter written by Frenchmen had to be published in Holland or in England. Arthur Young saw in the absence of newspapers one of the causes of the panic which seized whole classes and entire neighbourhoods on the outbreak of the Revolu tion. Absurd rumours were put into circulation, and there were no journals by which to test their accuracy ; for if the press is sometimes a purveyor of gossip, it is above all a corrector of false in telligence.

The Directory followed the example of the ntion.

The first article- ot a consular decree, [anuary 17th, 1 800, disposed ol journalism once and, if n< it f< >r ever, at least for a considerable time. It sets forth that the minister of justice shall, so long as the war lasts, allow no more than thirteen political journals, each of which is specified by name, to he published at Paris. 'Lhe fifth article of this decree provided for the instant suppression of all newspapers in serting articles which might be wanting in \"the respect due to the social compact and the sovereignty of the people, or to the glory of the French armies,\" or which might print \" invectives against the governments and the nations allied to or in friendly relations with the Republic, even though these articles were extracted from foreign periodicals.\" Nor did Napoleon's vigilance cease with this. He despised newspapers, but was afraid of books. Accord ingly, while the censorship was re-established for journals, printing and publishing offices were made monopolies, and placed under surveillance as in the best days of the old Monarchy. It was for the master to think, to will, to act for all his subjects ; he wished France and all Europe to be occupied with him alone. The police took care that there should be silence around him, and human thought was represented by the voice of the cannon. On the fall of Napoleon a charter was given to France by the restored Monarchy, in which the French were declared to possess the right of publishing and printing their opinions conformably to the laws intended to repress the abuse of this liberty. But the very first bill introduced into the new assembly subjected pamphlets to the censorship, and newspapers to the authorisation of the crown, while printers were required to take out lice nee-, which would only be continued on good behaviour. In 1815, during the Hundred Days, the emperor established the liberty of the press, and the second Restoration maintained this concession. Only for a time, however; on the assassination of the Due de Berry, some one discovered that \"the real dagger which had Stabl ed the duke \" was a liberal idea ; and a law was passed by which a Government authorisation was required before starting a newspaper. The censorship was at the same time re-established, while police courts were empowered to Suspend and suppress newspapers on the ground of evil tendencies. Finally, the notorious \"ordon nances\" of 1830 suppressed liberty of the press altogether.

But the newspaper stamp was maintained, and no one could start a journal without previously depositing a large sum as caution -money, with which to pay damages in case of libel. After the Revolution of 1848 liberty of the lire-- was once more proclaimed, and it seemed as though France might at last accustom itself to free newspapers, even as Mithridates accus tomed himself to poison. Then, however, in 185 1, came the Coup d'etat, and once more the pie-- was fettered. A system of \"warnings\" and of \"communiques \" was now adopted. The communique was a notice addressed to the journal by the Government, which the editor of the journal wtts obliged to insert. The warn ings were of two kinds \u2014 first and second ; a first warning, administered at will by the authorities, had no immediate effect ; but after a second warning, the journal receiving it could beat once suppressed. \"This ingenious system was so much admired that it was forthwith adopted,\" says M. Laboulaye in an article on the subject, \" by the four great states which march at the head of modern civilisation : Spain, Turkey, Austria ami Russia. It was necessary, moreover, under the Sect mel Empire to 1 ibtain, before publishing a new journal, an authorisation from the Government. Lhe- first newspaper established in France was the Gazette dc France, founded by the physician of Louis XIIL in 1631 ; the most widely known and the most highly esteemed being the Journal des Debats, founded by the Bertin brothers in 1789, the great revolutionary year in which also the official organ under all systems of govern ment, Le M, ut/cur Puircrscl, was started. La Fresse was founded in 1836 by Emile de Girardin, and it must always be rein. the first cheap journal started in France, and in deed in all Europe. Paris has now newspapersat two sous anil even one sou ; but in 1836 a journal at three sous, the price at which La Pie-, issued, seemed ti marvel ; and M. de Girardin's enemies ofthe established journals hinted in no doubtful terms that his journal at three SOUS could only exist through the aid of a Government subvention. It has been related elsewhere how an innuendo to this effect from Armand Carrel led to a duel in which Carrel, while inflicting a serious wound on M. tie Girardin, w shot dead. Many years Liter than 1836, when La Fresse was started, the invariable price of a London morning newspaper was hvepeiice ; there was a penny stamp on each number issued. and tm impost of eighteenpence on each adver tisement. The cheap press has only been rendered possible in Flngland by the removal oi the newspaper-stamp, the advertisement-stamp, anil finally the duty on paper. Among the contributors to the Journal des Debats may be mentioned : Michel Chevalier, Saint-Marc Girardin, John Lemoinne, Prevost Paradol, Renan, and Taine ; the dramatic criticisms of the journal were for many years written by Jules Janin, and the musical criticisms by Berlioz.

This last-named journalist, Italian by nationality, was by ni 1 means an honour to the French press ; he was more than suspected of taking bribes, and when the- Society of Men of Letters instituted an inquiry into his conduct, he attacked the secretary of the society so violently in the paper called Le Corsaire, that a challenge and a duel ensued. Amedee Achard was run through the body, and Fiorentino passed some 111 prison. Achard did not die, nor did Fiorentino lose his position on the press. The tion made against him by the Society of Men of Letters was that he acted at once as musical critic and musical agent ; and it might (airly be presumed that singers on whose salaries he received a commission were more carefully 1 after and more warmly praised than those lid not employ his services. He is said to have attempted to justify himself to some of his '\u25a0\u25a0 by representing himself as the \"Artists' ate \"\u2014 \" L'avocat des artistes ; \" though his true function, the one which he was understood by die editor of his newspaper and by his readers to have undertaken, was that of critic or judge. To the accusations brought against him by the . of Men of Letters he replied, however, by a simple denial ; and the object of the duel he- had sought with Amedee Achard was evidently to prevent such accusations from being brought ' him in the future.

Sarcey possesses, as a writer, neither the ingenuity and charm of Jules Janin, nor the dazzling style of Theophile Gautier, or of Paul de Saint-\\ 'ictor, nor the delicate observation of Nestor Roqueplan ; but he is inspired, more perhaps than any other critic, by taste, love, passion for the stage. Le Monde was started under that name in 1 Soo as a substitute for E Univers, which, placing the Pope before the Emperor and prefer ring Rome to Paris, had got itself into trouble with the Government. It was edited for main years by M. Louis Veuillot, most vigorous of Ultramontane journalists, and author of several remarkable books, including \" Les Odeurs de Paris,\" \" Les Parfums de Rome,\" and a curious study of feudal rights and privileges, as, accord ing to M. Veuillot, they really existed 111 France before the Revolution. Le Temps, one of the best of the Paris papers, after having been discontinued for some years, was revived in 1 8b 1 by M. Nefftzer, previously editor of La Fresse. Le Temps soon took rank as what the French call a serious journal. For many years one of the most interesting features of Le Temps was the letter on English affairs contributed from London by M. Louis Blanc. Among the other distinguished contributors to Lc Temps may be mentioned M. Scherer, the literary critic, and M. Louis Ulbach, chiefly known as a novelist, but who for many years wrote for this journal its theatrical feuilleton. There are plenty of papers published in Paris besides those we have mentioned, some of them in the enjoyment of large circulations, but distinguished by no marked features, or by none that possess special interest for English readers. The best-known, however, of all the Paris journals is the Figaro. published originally under the Restoration, and edited for some time by Nestor Roqueplan. After numerous prosecutions, it ceased to exist ; suppressed practically if not formally by the ( rovernment.

Goethe seems to have thought still more highly of him. \"Voltaire,\" he- said, \"will always be looked upon as the greatest man in the literature of modern times, and perhaps even of all times ; as the most astonishing creation of Nature, a creation in which it has pleased her to collect for mice in a single frail organisation every variety of talent, all the glories of genius, all the powers of thought.\" Very different, indeed, was the opinion enter tained by the great supporter of absolute monarchy and of the Roman Catholic Church. \" Paris,\" wrote Count Joseph de Maistre, \" crowned him ; Sodom would have banished him , I un I to picture to you what he make- me 42"], [720, "274 PARIS, OLD AND NEW.

This did not suit the views ot his father, who wished his son to enter the magistracy. He according!} separated him from the Abbe de Chateau -Neu! to attach him as page to the Marquis of th. name, who took the young Voltaire or Arouet, to call him by his proper name, in his suite to Holland. Returning to Paris, the youthful Arouet began to write, when he adopted, I.,; literary purposes, the name of Voltaire, which will be recognised as an anagram of Arouet 1. j. (le jciinc). According to most historians the name of Voltaire was borrowed by the youthful Arouet from an estate belonging to his mother ; but there seems to be no authority for this supposition, and the anagrammatic or quasi-anagrammatic explanation is probably the true one. It must be remembered, however, that in Voltaire's time there was no such tiling in France as either political or religious liberty, and that he took the part of the persecuted whenever he had an opportunity of doing so. \" His life,'' says M. Arsene Houssaye, \" is a comedy in five acts, in which, through French genius, shines human reason. The first act takes place in Paris, among distinguished noblemen and popular actresses ; beginning with the entertainments of the Prince de Conti and ending with the death of Adrienne Lecouvreur, whose hurried secret burial by torch-light inspired Voltaire with so much indignation. This was the period of the Bas tille and of banishment. The second act takes place at the castle of Cirey and at the court of King Stanislas ; this second act might be called the love of science and the science of love. The third act takes place at the court of Frederick II. , at Berlin, Potsdam, and Sans-Souci. The fourth act is that of Ferney, where he builds a church (with erexit Voltaire' inscribed over the portal), gives a dowry to Corneille's niece, defends the family of the persecuted Calas, pleads for Admiral Byng, for Montbailly, for La Barre, for all who are in need of an advocate. The fifth act takes place at Paris, like the first ; but the man who at the beginning of the drama was a prisoner and a proscript has come back as a conqueror. All Paris rises to salute him. The Academy believes that Homer, Socrates, and Aristophanes are to be found again in Voltaire ; the Theatre Francais crowns him with immortal laurels. But the poet ha.- reached the last point of greatness ; Paris smothers in its embraces this ruler of opinions, who with his last breath proclaims the rights of man.\" Voltaire had not long exercised his pen when he was thrown into the Bastille as the author of a satire which he had not written. Here lie sketched out the plan of his \"Henriade\" ami of his \" Siecle de Louis XIV.,\" both suggested to him, it is said, by the Marquis de Chateau-Neuf. 'Lhe true author of the satire having been discovered, Voltaire was set at liberty, and, according to the custom ofthe time, received a money indemnity from the Regent, whom he thanked for proi him with food, while expressing a hope that he would not in future furnish him with a lodging, Besides making notes for his historical work and for his epic poem, Voltaire had written in the Bastille a tragedy on the subject of (Edipus, which in 1718, when the author had just at tained his twenty-fourth year, was produced at the Theatre Francais with a success which no other tragedy had obtained since the days ot Corneille and Racine. Voltaire's literary life in Paris was cut short by a painful incident. In an animated discussion he had taken the liberty of contradicting tin Chevalier de Rohan, who was cowardly el to lay a trap for his antagonist ; and getting him to leave the room, subjected him to violent maltreatment at the hands of his servant-- Voltaire challenged the Chevalier, who, however, not only refused him satisfaction, but had him shut up in the Bastille for six months and then banished from France. Taking refuge in England, he studied the language, literature, anil especially the philosophy of the country. After a residence of three years he was able to make known to his Born in 1694, this powerful writer was so weak as a child that it was not thought safe to baptise him until he was nine months old. His father was treasurer in the fvxchequer Chamber, and he had for godfather the Abbe de Chateau-Neuf, one of those sceptical abbes who help to give a character of its own to the eighteenth century. As a youth he was in the good graces of Ninon de L'Enclos, the celebrated beauty, who, living to a prodigious age, is said to have preserved her charms to the last.

It was during his residence in Eng land that he wrote the tragedies of Brutus, The ,r, Zaire, &c, which, however un-Shakespearian, were evidently the outcome ofa study of Shakespeare's plays. Voltaire's position in regard to Shakespeare has been somewhat misunderstood. He did not fully appreciate Shakespeare, he even undervalued the great dramatist. But he saw that genius was in him ; which is more than can be said of some of our own writers of the eighteenth century, \u25a0.eluding Addison, who, in The Spectator, points to \"Shakespeare and Lee \" for examples ofthe \" false sublime.\" -- one of the finest libraries in France. Another production of his, the \" Epistle to Urania,\" which expressed theological view most unorthodox kind, was soon to get him into fresh trouble, though by a well-known artifice of those tyrannical days he disavowed the work. He thought it prudent, all the same, to keep out of the way for a time, and he now accepted the hospitality offered to him lw Mme. du Chatelet at Cirey. He here gave himself up for a time, in common with his hostess, to mathematical and scientific studies. He published one after the other, with astonishing rapidity, \" Newtonian Elements,\" \" Mahomet,\" Merope, \"The Discourse on Man,\" and other works, besides going on with his \" Century of Louis XIV.\" and his essay on moral-. Voltaire's reputation was now European ; and the Prince Royal of Prussia, afterwards Frederick the Great, one of his most fervent admirers, wrote to him begging him to undertake the publication of his \" Anti-Machiavel,\" though as Mickievicz the Polish poet says in reference to this work, it was Machiai ellism itself that Frederick II. both practised and professed. In the midst of his success, Voltaire, as irritable as he wa- kind-hearted, suffered much from the attacks of pamphleteers, whose favourite accusa tion was that, writing on many different subject-, he was not master of one. To these attacks he replied in the most impetuous style, though he would have done better to preserve the silence of profound disdain. Voltaire, however, reminds one, in this respect, of that horseman who, riding through a forest, was so exasperated by the chirping of myriads of grasshoppers, that he leaped at last from his saddle, and, drawing his sword, set about the vain task of exterminating the offensive insects, although nightfall was at hand and they would shortly have grown silent of their own accord. The pamphleteer and poetaster, Jean Freron, was a favourite object of Voltaire's detestation; he it was for whom Voltaire took the trouble to make an adaptation of a quatrain originally belonging to the Greek Anthology. Here are Voltaire's lines \u2014 \" Un jour loin du sacre- vallon Un serpent mordit Jean Freron : During his stay in England Voltaire mixed freely in literary society, and made the acquaint - if -ome of our best writers.

Temple oj Glory, Samson, and Budkah, the ballet Princess oi Navarre, &c. Soon, however, the part of court poet fatigued him, the more so as the king treated him coldly and Mme. de Pompadour thought him inferior to Crebillon.

Here he received flattering letters from the sovereigns of Europe, and no less flattering visits from some of the first literary men of the time. Princes and philosophers made pilgrimages to Ferney, and \"Patriarch of Ferney\" became Voltaire's re cognised name. The fact of Switzerland's being a republic did not, of course, prevent the Swiss landed proprietors from having serfs, and Voltaire did his best to procure their personal liberation.

Meanwhile that Voltaire did not die reconciled to the Church is sufficiently proved by the fact that Christian burial was denied him. His nephew, the Abbe Mignot, had the corpse hastily carried to his abbey at Cellieres, where it remained until the days of the Revolution \u2014 when it was brought back in triumph to Paris and placed in the Pantheon, the former church oiySaint -Genevieve.

Here, inspired, no doubt, by the situation, he composed in hot haste his \" Essay on Despotism,\" which deals, however, not merely with the arbitrary exert ise of power, but with such concomitants of political despotism as immoderate taxation and standing armies. An insult having been offered t of his sisters, Mirabeau broke through the rules imposed upon him, and, always at the suggestion of his father, was captured, this time to be imprisoned in the castle of If: familiar to the readers of Dumas's \" Monte Cristo.\" Here he paid so much attention to the wife of the steward that it was found necessary to transfer him to another fortress. His new abode was close to Pontarlicr ; and he obtained permission to quit the fortress and take up his residence in this town. At Pontarlier he made the acquaintance of Sophie tie Ruffcv, the young wife of the Marquis de Monnier, to whom, under the name of\" Sophie,\" he was a few years afterwards, as a prisoner in the Bastille, to address the passionate letters generally known as \" Lettres a Sophie.\" His relations with Sophie, whom he induced to leave her husband in 1 irder t( > acce impany him t< 1 Hi illand, brought upon him a criminal action and a tragic sentence.

M1ral1t.au was present at the death of Frederick and at tin inauguration of his successor ; when with mar vellous confidence he gave the new sovereign sunn advice as to the art and method of governing \u2022' great country. Mirabeau, meanwhile, did his work conscientiously as agent ot the French court ; addressing to the minister Calonne seventy letters, which were published in the year of the Revolution, under the title of \" Secret History of the Court of Berlin, Letters The passionate letters were all copied in the Secretary's Office ; and it is only from these copies, as printed and published in 1702 by Manuel, pro cureur of the Commune of Paris, that the epistles are nt iw km iwn. They were obviously not written for general reading. Jotted down from day to day, without thought of anything but the woman he loved and the passion by which he was inspired, they contain passages which even persons with out prudery (a fault charged by Mirabeau against Sophie's mother) might have desired to see omitted ; but they are eloquent, impassioned, and, though affected by the senses, written from the heart. During his captivity at Vincennes, which lasted forty-two months, Mirabeau composed a number of works, many of which, as mentioned in the letters to Sophie, seem to have been lost. He made for Sophie's own private reading some edifying translations from the tales of Boccaccio and from the Basta of Johannes Secundus ; and he wr< .te a novel that every 1 me would not care tt 1 read, called \"Ma Conversion.\" Liberated from prison in December, 17*0, he went straight to Pontarlier, where he constituted himself a prisoner.

During his stay at Berlin Mirabeau collected materials for his \" Prussian Monarchy,\" published in i;vS 'tour volumes in quarto or eight volumes ; a vast composition which at least bore witness to Mirabeau's capacity in matters of politics, legislation, administration, and finance. In his address to the Batavians he set forth all the principles which were afterwards to serve as to the declaration of the rights of man. in the midst of the constant embarrassments of a precarious and harassed life. \" Mirabeau,\" says M. Nisard, \" learns as he writes and writes as he learns. To conceive and to produce are with him one and the same thing. The convocation ot the States General opened to him a theatre worthy of his genius and of his immense ambition. He hurried to Provence and presented himself as a candidate before the Assembly of the Nobility, which, in spite of his persistent demands, put him aside as being neither owner nor occupier of land in Provence. He then turned to the people and was promptly elected a representative of the Tiers fitat. His entry into political life was an event of the THE SEINE, BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE QUAI DES AUGUSTINs rvations on the Prison ol Bicetre,' and on the the severity of punishments oked upon as the complement ol hii \"Lettres de Cachet.\" Writing in great haste, he astonished the nergy and intellectual fecundity highest importance.

This involved the departure of the representatives of the Tiers Etat from their habitual rendezvous. \"Tell your master,\" exclaimed Mirabeau, in word- which were to become historical,\" that we are here by the will ofthe people, and that nothing can mine us but the force of bayonets.\" Meanwhile Mirabeau, who had begun his political life with so much dignity, was actually ruining his position by his own personal extravagance. He entered into relations with the court, and before delivering his speeches submitted them to the king ami queen. The king asked for a list of his debts, which amounted to 200,000 francs, and included a sum that had been owing seventeen years for his wedding suit. Besides paying his debts, Louis XVI. promised to furnish his new auxiliary with a pension of 6,000 franc- per month. He placed, moreover, in the hands of the Count tie La Marck, who had acted as intermediary, a sum of one million, which was to be given to Mirabeau tit the end of the session if, as he had promised to tio, he served with fidelity the can-. ..f the king and queen. the dramatic side of Mirabeau's oratorical talent was fully shown. Labours, excesses of every kind, had at last worn out his robust constitu tion. It was saitl that poison had been ad ministered to him ; but he was the author of his own destruction. 'Lhe very day titter hi to., creditable understanding with the court he rushed into expenditure ot every sort, so that .me of his best friends could not help saying: \" Mirabeau is badly advised in making such a display of his opulence. He must be afraid of passing for tin honest man.\" He knew that he was killing himself, and though hi- doctor, Cabanis, begged him to lead a more moderate life, the advice passed unheeded. He was taken ill on the 27th of March at Argenteuil, near Paris ; which did not prevent him from partici pating next day in an important debate. He triumphed, but left the Assembly exhausted, de pressed, and with death written on his face. On the morrow he was hopelessly ill, and tit the end of April he expired. The news ot his death caused universal grief, and it was at once voted that his remain- should be deposited in the former church of St. Geneviev known since the Revolution as the Panthei in. Here tin ashes of the greatest writer the Revolution had produced were allowed to repose until, in the Autumn of 1704, the Republicans of the Lett having meanwhile been enlightened as to the part Mirabeau had played in connection with the court, they were removed to give place to the dust of Marat, whom Charlotte Corday had just assassinated. What honest man, asked sol at the time, could desire his remains to lie by side of Mirabeau? 'Lhe great orator was now worse treated by the republic than Moliere. > ol taire, and Adrienne Lecouvreur had been by tr \u25a0 clergy of the ancient monarchy. His relics were disturbed from what should have been their last resting-place, and conveyed at night without form or ceremony to Clamart, the graveyard of those who died at the hand- of the executioner. There is nothing sadder in the modern history of France than the sti the entries and exit- of its reputed great men into and out of the church or temple now once more known as the Pantheon. After these facts, it has been gravely asked whether or not Mirabeau sold himself to the court. Saint-Beuve has answered the question in his own ingenious way, by saying that Mirabeau, without selling himself, allowed him self to be paid. 'Lhe distinction scarcely amounts to a difference. Mirabeau now wrote frequently to the king anil -till more frequently to the queen, till at last nothing would satisfy him but to have an interview- with Marie Antoinette, whose minister he would gladly have become, the king leaving everything to tin queen, the queen everything to the would-be director of her policy. Before long the double position held by Mirabeau produced its inevitable effects. To maintain his influence with the Assembly and with his own constituents he had to play the part ofa tribune, while, to gain his subsidies from the court, he was bound to show himself a firm supporter ofthe monarchy. Inordinately ambitious, dissipated in the extreme, an aristocrat by taste and a democrat by conviction, he was perpetually in trouble of the most exasperating kind. In February, 1791, he was elected to the presidency of the Assembly, as candidate of the Moderate party, the Right. His vigorous opposition to the law proposed against the emigres laid him open to grave suspicions. \"Silence, those thirty voices!\" he called out when Barnave, Lameth, and their friends among the orators of the Left tried to interrupt him.

He now gave himself up to studying sentiment, until after the lapse ofa few years Madame tie Varennes became tired of his society, ami the young man left Chambery for Montpellier, where he proposed to get medical treatment for a fancied polypus ofthe heart.

A year titter wards,in 1 841, he left Lyons for Paris, now fired by literary ambition and excited bv the news that con stantly reached him of the triumphs of Voltaire. He took with him to the French capital a new system of musical notes, a five-act comedy, and fifteen louis d'or. His musical innovations, sub mitted to the Academy, were not understood ; but perhaps for that reason they made some noise and facilitated his introduction into many good houses. For some little time he led a life of elegant leisure, timing which he made the acquaintance of several of the first literary men of the day. But it was necessary for him to earn his living, and he was glad to accept an engage ment with Madame Dupin, daughter of the famous financier, Samuel, who wanted a secretary; and soon afterwards Madame de Broglif got him sent to Venice as secretary to the French Ambassador, Count tie Montaigne. Before long, however, Rousseau had a violent quarrel with his chief, who seems to have been a man of 11: able disposition. Rousseau's birth cost his mother her life. \" My 1 died when I was born,\" he says in the -ion-, \" -o that my birth was the first of my tunes.\" His father, a watchmaker by trade and a man of some education, had the greatest affection for his son, but was unable to forget at what cost In had been brought into the world. Thus Rousseau's first impressions were of the -t kind. The little boy was brought up by his father's .ister, and many were the novels or rather 10- - that he read under her guidance. Soon, however, he turned to more serious studies, his rite authors being now the Greek and Roman historians, and particularly Plutarch.

Rousseau, how ever, maintained that the idea of treating the subject from the- negative point of view originated with himself alone. \" If ever anything,\" he wrote Rousseau, however, instead of profiting by the striking success he had achieved, resi lived in the first place to put in practice the principles of simplicity and even asceticism which he had expounded in his treatise. At the time of the essay's being published he occupied the lucrative post of cashier to M. de Franceuil, one of the Farmers General. But he now refused to have anything to do with finance, preferring to gain his bread by copying music. This resolution did but increase his re putation and cause his writings to be- in greater demand than ever. Soon after wards, in 1762, his opera, The Village Seer f Le ileriu du village), was re presented at Fontainebleau with immense success. The king wished the authoi of the graceful pastoral to be presented to him, and a pension awaited him. But he turned his back on the seductions of fortune anel resumed his copying. There were not wanting detractors, who saw in this fine spirit of independence simply the pride of Antisthenes visible through the holes in his coat. In 1753 Rousseau published his \"Let ters on French Music\" and bis \"Dis course on the Origin of Inequality.\" Then he journeyed to Geneva, when he returned to Protestantism in ordei to recover the title of citizen, which in clue time he lost once more, after the publication of \" Emile.\" Tired of the world, he now accepted an asylum which was offered to him by his friend, Madame d'Epinay, in the valley of Montmorcncv, where he wrote nearly the whole of his famous \"Nouvelle Heloise.\" The work would doubtless have benefited by the omission of many a rhetorical phrase ; but the passion \"for nature, the exalted JEAN JAI - iEAU. long afterwards, \"resembled a sudden inspiration, it was the movement that at once took place in my mind on reading the advertisement. Suddenly my intelligence was dazzled by a thousand lights.

His paradoxes wounded many a writer, many a poet, many a would-be philosopher. But meanwhile all the literary and scientific society of Paris had been thrown by Rousseau's arguments into a state of commotion. delirium of the heart and the senses, the storms, the tears which it contained, were things so new that the whole generation allowed itself to be carried away with the transports ut Rousseau. He had found inspiration for the book, it was said, in his unfortunate love tut Madame d'Houdelot \u2014 a love which almost degenerated into a mental derangement and which commenced his series ol misfortunes. Madame d'Epinay, who was then in relationship with Grimm, saw with no kindly eye the affec tion of Jean Jacques for another than she. Rousseau soon found his position SO disagreeable that, breaking with Madame d'Epinay, he abruptly"], [731, "to the Pantheon.) ROUSSEAI 285 quitted her house although it was the depth of winter. Hospitality was offered to him at Mont louis, near Montmorency, and there he wrote his '' Letter to d'Alembert on Stage Plays,\" a pamph let which caused a considerable stir. Voltaire was then the king of the theatre ; and to attack one contributions. The unnamed warrior marched, says M. Thiebaut de Berneaud, towards the last abode of the sentimental philosopher, and, uncovering himself as he drew near,' ordered his troops to treat Ermenonville, its inhabitants, and all that belonged to it, with was to attack the other. Voltaire was enraged, and could not keep within bounds. He insulted his adversary, who, however, did not reply in the same tone. This quarrel, which ended to the advantage ol Rousseau, had the effect of diverting his mind for a moment ; but very soon he be came once more a prey to that morbid melan choly and suspicion which were to accom pany him to his grave, and which rendered the remainder of his life painful to contem plate. He died in at Ermenonville, whither he had been invited on a country visit by M.de Girardin, at a time when old . infirmities, and misery had already driven him traction. The eccentricities weakness of his character, however, vanish in presence of his literary fame.

The Gothic church, with its fine exterior masonry, is void of all ornamentation within, It gives one the impression of having been sacked at some stage in its history, In a lateral chapel there is a monument raised to the memory of the Due d'Enghien. Apart from the fine foliage and the exhilarating air which serve to attract visitors to Vincennes, the place is celebrated for its fortress, which neither centuries nor revolutions have swept away. The dungeon, which is now the only remnant of the citadel commenced by Philippe de Valois, and completed by Charles the Wise cm the ruins of the castle to which Philippe Augustus used to resort in view of the pleasures ..f the chase, was formerly encircled by eight towers, grouped around its walls like vassals around their lord. These, however, have been demolished by revolutions and by time. What the Parisians, however, come par ticularly to see, what they love, what they visit with the greatest eagerness, is the dun This old monument in stone is to them an object of worship. They envelop il with a fond curiosity, and, despite the horror they feel at the terrible scenes it has witnessed during so many centuries, they will not see it disappear without regret. In their imagination it is a legendary monument, and, in all probability, if the Bastille had not been torn up from the soil by the Great Revolution, that prison-fortress would now have been preserved with the utmost care for the gratification of public curiosity. To-day the redoubtable citadel in which so main- kings have sojourned is a military estab lishment, which includes an artillery arsenal, barracks, hospitals, a cannon foundry, a factory of arms, a chateau, tt church, and a great num ber of store-rooms. Its precincts are immense. I (ther fortresses are hidden in the immediate vicinity, and guard the approaches. Artillery men incessantly go and come between the fortress and the village and the village and the practice grt iund. No one finding himself at Vincennes after a country stroll fails to ascend to the summit of the dungeon. The visitor pants a little, perhaps, on reaching the platform which crowns it, but he is recompensed for his fatigue by the immense panorama which opens around him. There below, in that transparent vapour which the sun's rays never more than half penetrate, those myriads of roofs, those monstrous domes, those belfries, that stubble of chimneys whence clouds of smoke are escaping, that distant ami cea din which reminds one of the waves breaking on some shore, proclaim the gayest city in the world. At the foot of the edifice the forest stretches away, and behind the screen ot trees lies a limitless country, in which cultivated fields extend to the horizon. Everywhere orchards, hamlets, villages meet the eye. The Seine i not far off, and at no great distance, like a band of silver, the Maine meanders capriciously through an immense plain studded with clumps of trees. Penetrating the sombre vault which leads from the door of entrance to the interior court, the visitor finds before him the ancient royal resi dence, whose facade preserves something of the majesty of antiquity. 'Lo the left stands the chapel built by Charles V. in imitation of the Sainte-Chapelle of Paris, and which he dedicated to the Trinity and the Virgin, the fencing-room, and the tower of the reservoir ; to the right the formidable dungeon rears its head towartls heaven. In the space enclosed by these various con structions are stacked up, in faultless order, parallelograms of cannons and pyramids of bullets. Long rows of howitzers, their mouths directed skywards, are to be seen side by side with masses of enormous bombs. In the large neighbouring buildings are halls which contain, suspended from the walls, hooked up round the pillars, and symmetrically arranged in corners, a prodigious stock of guns, bayonets, and sabres. Everything shines and glitters : there is not a particle of dust anywhere. An army could here find sufficient weapons to invade a country. The church is close at hand. It recalls a peaceful and merciful divinity in a place consecrated to war. Prayers are uttered at a spot where men On one side a view is obtained of Montreuil, famed for its peaches ; on the other, by the river bank, a congregation of villas and cottag picturesque disorder shows the site of Port- Creuil, where Frederic Soulie sought literary repose.

Hard by is Saint-Maude, where Armand Carrel died of the wound received in hi- duel with Emile de Girardin. His tomb is in the cemetery, where stands a statue in his honour. Once arrived in the Bois de Boulogne, the visitor has not to travel far in order to see the Marne, that most capricious of French rivers. There is scarcely a Parisian who has not taken an exploring stroll along the banks of this stream, which conducts the oarsman to the very point whence he started. Artists and dreamers in search ot leafy shade, of trees overhanging a limpid stream, of mills beating the clear water with their black wheels, know the Marne well. On summer days many a peal of laughter may be heard to proceed from behind some shrubbery. Tourists come to the place iu quest of break fast : they are not in want of appetite, and they have for companions youth and gaiety. Frocks which the wearers tire not afraid of rumpling alternate with woollen blouses : the visitors row and sing, seeking, later on, some rustic restaurant where, beneath a green arbour, they can enjoy a bottle of white wine and a snack of fish, with an omelette, or some other light accessory. If the gaze is now turned sharply towards Paris, it encounters, beyond Alfort and its schools, Charenton, celebrated for that mansion us which Seba-ticii Leblanc conceived the first idea in 1 741, and, at the confluence of the Seine and the Marne, the chateau of Conflans, so long the residence of the Archbishop of Paris. In that immense space which lies beneath the eye there is scarcely a stone or a tree which does not recall some memory. All those roads, all those footpaths, have been trodden by men who were destined to leave a deep mark on the history of France. There is not a corner in this sylvan expanse where some civil or religious combat has not taken place. The Normans, the English, even the Cossacks have made incursions here. There ording to the expression of one French writer, not a tuft of grass which has not been stained with human blood. Through the villages it princes and kings have passed. Torch-lit onducting prisoners to the dungeon and to death, have alternated with triumphal -ton-, escorting sovereigns to their capital to the- flourish of trumpets. On that hill yonder Charles VII. raised a castle \u2014 the Castle of Beauty \u2014which preserves the memory of Agnes Sorel.

On hot Sundays, beneath a cloudless sky, num berless picnics are held in the Bois de Vincennes \u2014 a thing unfashionable in the Bois de Boulogne, where visitors would consider it beneath their dignity to eat from a cloth spread on the green turf. At Vincennes excursionists do not stand on ceremony, and if the weather is sultry men may be seen lounging in their shirt sleeves, and taking, in other respects, an ease which the in habitants of the Boulevards, who resort to the Bois de Boulogne, would contemplate with horror. If the families, however, who divert themselves at Vincennes do not rent a box at the opera, their unpretentious music probably affords them a pleasure none the less. It is a distinctly popular place to which they resort. You do not see there on Sunday new toilettes which evoke cries of astonishment : unpublished dresses dare not show themselves there, eccentric fashions do not bewilder the spectator'seye. People walk about there without pretension, usually on foot, in family groups, arriving by omnibus or rail. Sometimes, however, tit the time of the races you see those coaches and caleches which four high-spirited horses draw at a gallop. Beautiful ladies and fine gentlemen are hastening to share in the pleasures of the course. This is the hom os lace and silk.

DURING the middle ages the Palace of the Institute was one of the landmarks and limits of Paris. The rest ofthe left bank belonged to the agglomeration formed around the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pres, and which was called, during the different periods of its successive de velopments, the bourg, or borough, the town, and the faubourg of Saint-Germain. According to the legend, as turned to litti.ui account by Roger de Beauvoir in a novel, and by Alexandre Dumas and his collaborate! claimed to have done till, or nearly all the work in the before-mentioned play). Marguerite tie Bourgogne, wife of Louis X.,and her two sisters, or sisters-in-law, were accused ami convicted ot unbecoming conduct in the Tower ot Nesle ; when two of their accomplice-, Philippi Gaultier d'Aunay, were skinned alive, while Marguerite herself wa- strangled by order of her royal husband, the lives of the two other princesses being spared. According to the ancient tradition, the queen anil her used to receive their lovers in the apartrw the tower, and then, to prevent any promising revelations, throw them from the window into the Seine. Of the Institute a- a central body, with the live academies composing it, sufficient mention has already, perhaps, been made. Some words, however, may be added on the subject of the building \u2014 ihe \" Palace \" in which the Institute is lodged. Close to the Institute, which owes it- chief renown to the most important of its component academies, the Academic Francaise, representing literature, is the Mint, or Hotel des Monnaies, with whose products literature is too often but slightly connected. Nor can we leave the immediate neighbourhood of the Institute without speaking of the famous 'Lour tl Nesle, which figures so dramatically in a well-known play written bv Alexandre Dumas ami Frederic Gaillardet. One wing of the Institute occupies the very site ofthe old tower, which was situated on a tongue of earth projecting into the Seine. It stood seventy-five feet high, with a diameter of ten feet ; and the crenelated platform at the summit was reached by a winding staircase. Resting upon the tower was the Petit Nesle, given as a place of abode, in 1 540, by Frtu to Benvenuto Cellini. The king's right t po-e of the house was questioned, indirectly, it is true, but in a very substantial manner, by the Provost of Paris, who, after giving the Florentine artist notice to quit, tried to turn him by force; when Cellini, with hi- compai apprentices, and servant-, defended the place against the besiegers. It was in the Petit Nesle that this admirable sculptor execut"], [735, ""], [736, "A NIGHT REFUGE IN THK VAUGIRARD Ql \\RTER. 22"], [737, "TOUR DE NESLE. and the Rue Mazarine.] 28q masterpieces, his colossal statue of Jupiter in silver.

Cardinal Mazarin, having been unable to carry out personally the project he had formed of establishing a college for the benefit of sixty young noblemen, or young men of the citizen class belonging to the lands newly o inquered by the Crown of France, ordered by his will, on the 6th of March, 1661, that, should the king be so pleased, a college should be founded for sixty sons of gentlemen or of citizens belonging to the various territories \u2014 German, Flemish, and Provencal\u2014 lately annexed 1,000 crowns in ancient gold, which the royal I just delivered to him by order of I , when he was attacked by thieves Augustins \u2014 a \" very dangerous place.\" >w he ke'pt his assailants at a ce by sweeping blows from his and then ran away in all haste to his :. where he called to the garrison, which \"lit fully armed, thus enabling him to \"-enter safe and sound the- Petit Nesle, where he friends had a lively supper.

In like manner there were formerly \"four nations\" in the University of Paris. Mazarin had already drawn up the statute for the college, and he be queathed to it the whole of his library, with an income of 4.5,000 francs secured on town property, the revenue of the Abbey of Saint-Michel, and two millions of livres (francs) in silver. The cardinal's executors began by purchasing the Petit Nesle, the ditches and ramparts of the Rue des Fosses, which now became the Rue Mazarine; and a piece of land comprised between the Rue Mazarine, the Rue de Seine, and the Quay. The college was then erected and the library duly placed ; and until the time of the Revolution the Institute, as it was in time to be called, formed an important centre for men devoted to the study of literature, science, or art.

It can be saitl to have created the science of epigraphy, that resurrection of history from stones.

These condemnations have weakened neither the authority nor the glory of the French Academy ; they have, perhaps, even preserved it, by diminishing in its secret council! the influence of coteries. The idea of Cardinal Richelieu in creating it was to maintain the unity of the French language, and consequently of ! France, while giving to talent equal distinction ! with rank, birth, and official service.\" In suppressing the Institute the Revolution did not spare any one of its five' academies \u2014 not even the French academy, which, though it represented the literature of the country, had a taint of aristocracy about it. As soon, however, as France was delivered from the atrocities of the Revolution, the National Convention, in it- last sitting but one, on the 25th October, 1705, re constituted the Institute under the form of a society of 144 members, divided into three classes: (1) positive sciences, (2) political sc?i and (3) literature and art. The First Consul reorganised the society as four classes : (1) science, (2) literature, (3) ancient literature, (4) fine arts. Under this form the Restoration found nothing to change but the name ; and the four classes of the Imperial Institute became once more \" acad emies.\" The fifth, that of moral and political sciences, created by the Convention, was re-estab lished in 1832 on the proposition of M. Guizot, Minister of Public Instruction. Independently of their internal economy and their proprietorial right-, the five academies are bound together through the chief secretarial department, the library, and various collections belonging to the five academies in common. The unity of the academies is affirmed, moreover, every year through a formal sitting, of which the presidency falls in turn to each of the five academ ical presidents. \" It is a commonplace,\" says 'Lo pass once more from the Institute to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, this important social and historical district is bounded on the east by the ancient ditch or moat of Paris, now sented by the Rue Mazarine (formerly Rue de Nesle), the Rue tie l'Ancienne Comcdi. ,';md the Rue Monsieur le Prince.

It may here be mentioned that a privilege tor an academy of music had been ceded a hundred years before by Charles IX. to Antoine tie Bait, the word academy being used as an equivalent lor accademia, the Italian for concert. Pcrrin's licence seems to have been a renewal, as to form, of de Bait's ; and thus originated the eminently absurd title which the chief operatic theatre of Paris has since retained. There, too, was opened, in the last days of the a new theatre for tragedy and comedy, in opposition to the royal players of the Hotel de ogne, and under the title of L'illustre Theatre. Among the members of this remark able company may be mentioned the two Bejards, leine and Genevieve, and Jean Baptiste Poquelin, who had not yet taken the surname of re. The tennis-court still existed in 1 8 1 8 ; and it was not pulled down until about 1830, when space was wanted for the enlargement of the street. The old house where Moliere and his companions used to live is still in existence, numbered 10 in the Rue Mazarine and n in the Rue de Seine, by the side of a haberdasher's shop, to the sign of The Tennis Court. A com memorative tablet marks the spot where once stood the Illustre Theatre \u2014 a name it was one day really to deserve, from the fact that one of the important members of its company, con- d as an actor, was soon afterwards to show himself the greatest dramatist that France had produced. Another tablet in the same street - No. 4:\u2014 marks the ground once occupied by another tennis-court, which, in l66q, was let to the Abbe Perrin and several associates, with Cambers, the composer, among them, who had ted Irom the king the right or privilege of idling at Paris an operatic theatre.

Before settling down finally into its present abode at the Palais Royal end of the Rue Richelieu, the Comedie Francaise, or Theatre Francais \u2014 for the two names equally belong to it \u2014 had a varied history, and wandered about Paris from quarter to quarter and from street to street. Its first abodes seem to have been far less solidly constructed than our ancient national theatres of Drury Lane or Covent Garden; and in 1770 the famous company, finding itself in a building so dilapidated that its fall was daily imminent, the king granted it hospitality in one of the wings of the Tuileries Palace. He at the same time took steps to pro vide for it a permanent home ; and with that view bought for 3,000,000 livres (francs) the ground occupied by the Hotel tie Conde, where a new theatre was to be constructed. Here the Theatre Francais gave its performances through oue the first phases of the Revolution, until, on the 3rd of September, 1703, after the perform ance of a play founded on Richardson's Pamela, the Committee of Public Safety closed the house and arrested alike the author of the piece and the actors who had performed in it. The new playhouse was reopened under the successive titles of Theatre of Equality and Theatre ol the People, with a portion of the company \u2014 which had been saved bv the death of Robespierre. Classical names were now in fashion, and the theatre, on being reopened in 1707, was called, in memory of Athens, the Odeon. Its perform ances, however, were not successful, and after a wretched existence of a few months it closed iu 1799. When it seemed to have taken a new lease of life it wa- destroyed by fire, the origin of which was never explained.

The Odeon had once more been officially designated the second Theatre Francais, when a new fire de stroyed it on the 20th of February, 1818. Louis XVIII. ordered the immediate reconstruction of the hou-e, and, on its completion, put the second Theatre Francais on the same footing as the first, placing at its free disposal all the works of the classical repertory. which haw, of course, taken the place ot the now defunct work of Mine, tie Stacl, some dramas or plans t..r dramas, which were published in the Revue acs deux Mondes, the \" Line de Lazare,\" which appeared in the same periodical, and \"Lutece,\" are perhaps the most important of those of Heine's writings which have been . tlucetl in French. The \" Buch der Lieder, has been dt me into French prose by I seine himself, with the aid of his friend Gerard de Nerval, who in his youth, under the name of Gerard, made a translation of \"Faust\" which satisfied, 01 al least pleased, even Goethe himself. These Lieder, together with the \" Reisebilder,\" were Heine's favourite productions; and independently of the lie that is in them, many of them are further assured of continued popularity by reason of Schubert's haling coupled them with some of his most beautiful music. Since this time the Odeon has, in a literary and dramatic sense, undergone all kinds ot metamorphoses. It became first a lyrical theatre, with such pieces as Robin des Bois \u2014 correspond ing, in. doubt, t.. our Robin of the Wood, or Robin Hood ; this name having been given to a strange adaptation by Castil-Blaze, with in terpolation- by the adapter, of Weber's Der hiit: ; and under Louis Philippe- the Odeon w.i tin- headquarters of Italian opera. Heine was a poet and satirist by nature. En dowed with great analytical power, ami educated in Germany, he of course took ,1 pleasui studying the operations of the human mind ; but he was not a philosopher by temperament, which is sufficiently proved by the fact that he no refrained from attaching himself to any par ticular system of philosophy in a country where he had so main' to select from, but that he did not even take the trouble to invent a system for himself. He comprehended philosophy, liked painting, loved music, and spoke of all scieni art in the spirit of a poet. He explained Victor Cousin and Pierre Leroux, grew pathetic over the fate of Leopold Robert, and became enthu siastic in his admirable descriptions of the pi 1 - formances of Ernst and Paganini, ot Grisi and Mario. At present the Odeon is definitely classed as the second Theatre Francais, in which character no rent and enjoys an annual subvention of 100,000 franc-.

Ofthe many admirable piece- produced at the Odeon, full and interesting account- may be found in the col lected feuilletons of Jules Janin and of Theophile Gautier. Heine's poetry is principally remarkable fur its fantastic character and for its warmth of colour; accordingly, there are certain points 1 semblance between the German poet and Theophile Gautier, only there is soul in the verse of Heine, whereas in that of Gautier we find nothing but a glorification of the senses and 1 \u25a0 an absolute worship of form.

In the last chapter of the Reisebilder, speak- ing ofthe misfortune- of the German emigrants, Heine gives an anecdote of an artist who, on being requested to paint a golden angel on a signboard, replied that he would rather paint a red lion ; that he was accustomed to them, and that even if he painted a golden angel it would look like a red lion all the same. \" The words of this painter,\" said Heine, \"reply beforehand to the objections which may be made to my book. ...

In 1792 the king himself would have emigrated and thrown himself into the arms of foreigners, in the hope that they would subdue France and restore the ancient regime.

At the same time a crowd of noble- left France to furnish recruits to the Prince de Conde. Coblenz was full to over flowing with emigrants, whose man\u0153uvres were in no way affected by the fact that the king had himself accepted the constitution. The army of the emigrating princes was being openly organ ised. It was to be composed of three army corps : one commanded by Conde, which was to operate in Alsace ; another commanded by the princes of the blood, who were to enter France through Lorraine, in company with the Prussians, and march upon Paris ; and a third commanded by the Prince de Bourbon, which was to act in the provinces of the north. Later on special regiments of emigres were formed, to which the names of Rohan, Damas, Salm, \"Loyal Emigrants,\" etc., were given. 'Lhe Viscount de Mirabeau, brother to the orator, formed a legion of his own, whose soldiers wore a black uniform adorned with death's-heads, and whose disorderly conduct is said to have been such that the corps was not allowed to form part of the Austrian army, to which it had originally been attached. As the Louvre i- associated with the mon archy and Notre Dame with the Episcopacy, so mbourg St. Germain i- associated with the ancient French nobility. It is interesting to know that St. Germain, the holy man to whom the nobiliary quarter (there ;ue \"aristo cratic\" quarters elsewhere in Pari-i owes its name, was himself of noble birth. Little is recorded of him except that he performed miracles, which the inhabitants of the district hearing his name have tailed to do, and that, like the ancient nobility of France at the period of the Revolution, he visited England and stayed there some time. The church of . 1 main des Pics was one of the principal landmarks on the left bank of the Seine in the latter part ofthe seventeenth century, when the Institute and the church just named formed two important centres on the left bank of the Seine. The Faubourg St. Germain, or simply \"the Faubourg,\" as its exclusive in habitants love to call it, was scarcely known, how ever, by any such name until the time of the Revolution or even later, when it emigrated in England, or in some ca-c-s to Russia. The German court-, too, offered for a time a favourite place of retirement until Germany was ima led by the Republican armies of France. \"The emigration\" i- usually attributed to the exi the Revolutionists, especially during the Reign of Terror; but as a matter of fact it began in 17S0, the first examples being by members of the royal family.

The Comite de Salut Public having got hold of the name under which I concealed myself in France, caused an article, relative to I know not what correspondence, supposed to have existed between Louis XVI. and the King of Prussia, to be inserted in the public papers.

During th. first days I paid but little attention to what was whispered about.

He sent for the Abbe Lalgcworth to receive the insignia from his hands and to convey them to his royal master, who, in return, presented the Order of the Holy Ghost to the emperor. The princess attended the death-bed of the Abbe Edgeworth, administered medicine to him with her own hands, and received his dying breath. This is here recorded, not to do honour to the Abbe Edgeworth, but to do ju-tice to human nature and the gratitude of princes\u2014 a virtue whose existence would not, perhaps, have so often been doubted if there had been more examples of attachment as disinterested, -incere, and steady as that which, beyond possibility nt doubt, was manifested by him whose life was the best proof at once of his loyalty and his faith. When the Abbe Edgeworth arrived at the Court of Russia, Paul was so much struck by his venerable appearance, that he prostrated himself before him and implored his blessing. He pre sented the abbe with his picture set in diamonds, and settled upon him a pension of 500 roubles a year.

Bonaparte, who had now conquered the Revolution, was only too anxious to obtain the support of the old French nobility, and did his best to make them accept him in the 11 he had conquered. But as the great majority of the ancient nobility, the former inhabit ants of the Faubourg St. Germain, stayed abroad, Napoleon, on becoming emperor, created a new nobility, choosing its members among his most lui generals and high officials. In 1S14, and again in 1815, the Faubourg St. Germain ne more inhabited, and until the downfall of Charles X. in 1830 the ancient nobility seemed to ba\\e resumed its position in Fiance. It was n..t always possible to restore the estates which had been confiscated ; but large pecuniary allow ances had been made to those who had suffered bv the confiscation. In 1830 a number of new ..ere created by King Louis Philippe, who, unable to count on the Legitimists of the Faubourg St. Germain, felt it necessary to improvise a nubility of hi- own. There was now in France a mist nobility, an Orleanist nobility, and a nobility which owed its origin to the creations of Napoleon I. like its present shape until the reign of Francis L, who turned it into a palace. The rebuilding is said to have occupied nearly two thousand work men for the space of twelve years. During the latter part of his life Francis often lived in the newly built chateau, whose magnificent halls he embellished with the finest works of art. It was on one of the windows of the castle that, after patiently listening to an apology made by his si.-ter Marguerite for the alleged weakness of her sex, he is said (on good authority) to have written with a diamond the famous distich : \" Toute femme varie Bien fol qui s'y fie.\" These lines are usually given, \" Souvent femme varie,\" etc. Such, indeed, is the version adopted by the author of Le Koi s Amuse \u2014 in the situation where, in Verdi's operatic arrangement of Victor Hugo's play, the canzone \"La donna e mobile\" occurs. \"Toute femme varie\" seems too absolute. The calumnious verses were, in any case, according to the legend on the subject, scratched out by order of Louis XIV., who found that they annoyed Mile. de la Valliere. Henry II. inherited all the taste of Francis for the Castle of Chambord, to which he made several additions, including a stately staircase in the western court, where the armorial bearings of his mistress Diana, a crowned H and a crescent, are seen in company with his own device: \" Donee totum impleat orbem.\" It was at Chambord that this sovereign ratified, in 1552, the treaty which he had concluded the year before at Fontainebleau with the Protestant princes of Germany. Charles IX. repaired and adorned the castle, though to no very great extent, owing to the failure of his resources. The modest Louis XIIL was frequently at Chambord ; and historians say that during one of his stays there Mile, de Hautefort put a love-letter under his collar ; when, afraid to touch it with his fingers, he removed it by means ofthe tongs. Louis XIV. eared little for the castle, which, magnificent as it was, fell far short ofthe splendour with which he loved to be surrounded.

Possibly she was vexed at the scanty assistance given by the Count of Paris I of the family in 1S71, and again in il is a fact, in any ease, that the Count of Paris did not attend the Count of Chambord's funeral. This abstention was due to the Countess of Chambord's strange decision that her husband's 1 relatives should be regarded as nearer to him than his French kinsman, who, moreover, bythe Count of Chambord's death would become the legitimate heir to the French throne.

To argue in the present day that a foreign prince who is descended from Louis XIV. has therefore a better title to reign in France than a French prince who can only boast of a collateral relation ship with that sovereign, but who is himself the grandson of a French king, is to attach strange importance to a mere theory spun to suit the oc casion. Such a theory may have harmonised with the Countess of Chambord's private prejudices. But to state it is enough to show its weakness. If for one moment, and simply to conform to the arbitrary arrangements of a funeral pageant, the Count of Paris could have recognised it, he would by doing so have shown himself unworthy of all confidence.

'Lhe important point, however, in the eyes ot the Count of Chambord, was that the grandson of Louis Philippe, the great-grandson of Philippe Egalite, stuck to the Revolutionary tricolour, and declined to return to the flag ot the ancient monarchy. The grandson of a usurper ami great-grandson of a regicitle could have no claim, then, either in the past or in the present, to represent a line of kings tow anls which the grandfather had played the part of a betrayer and the gnat grandfather that ofa murderer. dispossessed occupier- of foreign thrones than to remain their ally at the cost of such sacrifices as were demanded from him. King Louis Philippe, in his last instructions to his grandson, laid no stress upon the principle of descent, but called upon him to be above all \" of his own time and of France.\" The shadowy potentates to whom the Count of Paris was invited to submit himself at Frohsdorf are as far removed from France by their nationality as from the present time by their ideas. The fault, however, charged against the Count of Paris by the late Count of Chambord is as nothing compared to the offence of which his grandfather, Louis Philippe, is held to have been guilty ; which, again, cannot be likened for atrocity to the crime committed by Louis Philippe's father, Philippe Egalite. If the Count of Chambord's widow, remember ing her husband's last instructions, disavow Louis Philippe's grandson, his mother, the Duchess of Berry, disavowed Louis Philippe, and even organised against him an armed rebellion.

The Society of the Water-Merchants of Paris-The Navigation of the Seine-The Paris Staughter-Houses-Records of Famine is France\u2014 The Lot of the French Peasant in the Last Century\u2014 The Pan- Food Supply. THE navigation of the Seine has had remark- able effects on the commerce, and even the municipal government, of the great city traversed by this stream. Turning to the annals of the middle ages, one finds that nearly all the powerful towns seated on rivers profited by their posi tion to secure as much as possible exclusive vigation. With this view, the citizens sh. nved themselves as eager and as voracious as the nobility. Take, for instance, the towns of ne or of Mayence, which in medi\u00e6val forced all the boats passing down the Rhine to stop for three days and allow the in habitant- to purchase from their cargo whatever indise seemed desirable. Paris enjoyed such exceptional privileges. But the Parisian burgesses were rich and powerful. Besides their river privileges, they were entitled to half of all the money received in fines ; and the richer the citizens of Paris became, the better able they were to pay the various taxes levied in the name of the king. The king, moreover, received half the fines imposed upon smugglers ; and anyone who ventured to land the least merchandise without formal permission from the water-merchants was exposed to penal ties. The corporation of water-merchants sin nved pect for persons in levying its dues. Thus, it seized on one occasion the wine purchased by the Abbe tie St. Germain l'Auxerrois, because it had been landed without formal permission. The abbe appealed to the king, who submitted the matter to the Parliament, which, deciding that the abbe had acted within his rights, ordered the seizure to be annulled. 'Lhe Han seatic League was sufficiently powerful, however, to prevent the execution of the order, and the Abbe de St. Germain remained without his wine. At Paris, the inhabitants showed themselves equally resolved to profit by their position on the banks of the .Seine. A society was formed at an early date, under the title of \" Society of the Water-Merchants of Paris,\" in which were included the principal merchants receiving and distributing their goods by means of the river flowing through the town. This association, mentioned for the first time in documents be- longing to the reign of Louis VI., claimed the of levying sixty sous on every boat which go of wine to Paris timing the vintage.

There was but one important road to Paris, that of Orleans ; and on this road, at Mont Chery, a post was maintained, where dues were levied on cloth, linen, grain, cattle, sheep, and even hedgehogs. According to the barbarous custom ofthe time, a Jew was stopped at thi- post and made to pay for the privilege of entering Paris. He was charged something extra if he carried with him his lamp \u2014 probably the Limp with seven branches, used for the celebration of the Sabbath. His Hebrew books were also taxed.

Of these herrings were, in particular, supplied very abundantly. The association of water-merchants prided itself on keeping up a constant supply of pro visions, and boats were constantly reaching the capital from Burgundy at one end of the Seine or Normandy at the other. It was on Bur gundy for many centuries that Paris depended for its wine, and it was not until a certain noble man, dilapidated in constitution, sought refuge in the Governorship of Gascony, where the wine of the province restored him to health, that Bordeaux gained the good name it has since enjoyed among the Parisians. One of the most important trade corporations of medi\u00e6val Paris was that of the butchers, who, throughout French history, have shown a constant tendency to coalesce. At present, how ever, there is no bond of union between them, except that which results from their being sub jected to the same regulations in respect to the prices to be charged. An entertaining account of the privileges and corporate character of the ancient Paris butchers is given by M. Ducamp, who writes so well in his bulky work on Paris that even the chapter it contains on the abattoir is not only devoid ot horrors, but invested with interest. Great fairs were held at various points along the course of the Seine, which were scenes at once of commerce and of amusement. Foreign merchants and tradesmen, students from the university, mountebanks, drink-sellers, adven turers, and thieves, were brought together by every fan Buying ant! selling came to an end on the ringing of the Angelus, anil the scenes which followed partook, more or less, of the nature of orgies. All trades were subjected in medi\u00e6val Paris to strict regulations, and for sixty days in the year the Parisians were deprived of fresh bread. There was a master baker, or \"grand pane-tier,\" who was held responsible for the acts of the bakers, his sub ordinate , on whose behalf he had frequently to appear before the Grand Provost of the capital. 'Lhe pastrycooks, like the bakers, formed a corporation of their own, with special duties anil privileges. \" The animals bought in the market do not,\" he says, \" make a long stay there, but arc promptly conducted to the slaughter-houses, which now extend from the other side of the Canal de l'Ourcq, over an area of 211,672 metres, opening on to the Rue de Flandres. 'Lhe tu.. establishments pronounced necessary by the decree of the bth of August, 1859, were con structed simultaneously; the slaughter-hou thrown open on the 1st of January, 1807. \" The names of some of the old Paris streets in dicate the site of the markets in which butchers displayed their stock.

Formerly, animals were killed everywhere : to each stall a slaughter-hou attached.\" \"Blood streams down the streets,\" said Mercier ; \" it curdles under your feet and reddens your shoes.\" The taverns in the middle ages, as now, were frequented by the lower classes, and they had such a had reputation that Louis IX., by a p. 1 1 il edict, forbade their frequentation. Never theless, the tavern-keepers formed a corporation, legally established with its own statutes, and with licences imposed by the -State on very onerous terms. The king's proclamation, then, against the frequentation of taverns was without effect. Despite various attempts made to banish be yond the walls these slaughter-houses, which from every point of view were so dangerous, tin old spirit of routine long predominated, and in the early part of the present century animals still had their throats cut in front of the very doors where meat wtis sold.

These pavilions contain stalls, in which the beasts are kept whilst alive, and 1:5 tubs (echaudoirs) in which their flesh is divided up after the slaughtering has taken place within the interior court, situ ated in the centre of the buildings.

To strike with a pole-axe might have the effect of coagu lating the victim's blood, and the Levitical laws on the subject are strict and not to be trifled with. No animal, according to the Jewish custom, should be put to death except in piety, and the Jewish sacrifices like his counterpart among the Mohammedans of India, utters solemn words as he makes the fatal cut. sometimes a full quarter \u2014 of the harvest, with all sorts of minor clues, such as the feeding of the proprietor's hounds. The obligations of serving in the army, and of lodging and feeding the king's troop-, u,i, onerous indeed ; and what with the el imposed and the dues levied by the crown, the landlord, and the church, the position of the peasant was lamentable indeed. The laws for the preservation of game were not the least oppressive of those by which the unhappy serf was crushed. He was bound to cultivate certain kind- ol vegetables and grain to the taste of the birds, to leave the crops in the ground, and to allow the privileged sportsman to invade his farm and perhaps destroy everything of value upon it. Nor was it prudent to make am- complaint on the subject, and the Parlia ment of Paris, in an edict of the year 1779, punished as rebellious the inhabitants ofa parish which had claimed from sportsmen an indemnity for damages. A curious characteristic incident took place in Paris itself on the very eve of the Revolution. In the month of April, 1787, the Duke of Orleans, in the ardour of pursuit, fol lowed a stag into the heart of Paris, down the Faubourg Montmartre, across the Place Veiidnnie, and through the Rue St. Honore to the Place Louis V., upsetting and wounding numbers of persons as he tore along. 'Lhe history of the alimentation of Paris might be made the subject of an entire volume. Under the ancient monarchy it was the story of fat years alternating with lean years ; which latter were at times years of famine. Famine, indeed, was one ot the plagues of France until the beginning of the nineteenth century. In stead of allowing, as in the present day, supply to follow demand, the Government of the country maintained laws and regulations for particular provinces and privileges for particular corporations. Wheat had to be sold at fixed places anil nowhere else, and often it was left to rot in one district, while at another, not many miles distant, the peasants were dying of hunger. Lhe peasants, moreover, were burdened with such heavy charges, such distressing dues, that they sometimes gave up in despair the task of cultivating their fields. The nobility and clergy paid no taxes. Every thing fell upon the labourer, who was borne down by imposts. M. Maxime Ducamp speaks of a caricature he has seen, published the year before the Revolution, in which a peasant, old and ragged, is represented leaning forward upon his hoe, so that he has the appear ance of a three-footed animal. On his bended back rests a sleek bishop and a haughty nobleman. The harvest is being devoured beneath the peasant's eyes by rabbits, bio . and pigeons. Jacques Bonhomme, the typical peasant, is pensive ; but his features, strongly accentuated, express anything but resignation, and he mutters, in his own provincial dialect, \" We must hope that this game will soon be at an end.\" Desperate aud indignant at the oppression prac tised upon them, they would from time to time ri.-e against their agrarian tyrants. \"Jacqueries\" were organised in which all sorts of horrors were perpetrated. But in the end the insurgent peasants were reduced to order. It was found necessary to \"hang them a little,\" according to the expression of Mme. tie Sevigne \u2014 so amiable, so charming, when writing of persons in her own position of life. Then the poor man went back to his hut and took up once more the shovel and the hoe. For he had plenty of work to do, and out of the little he earned he had to pay taxes to the king, tithes to the clergy, and dues of all kinds to his lord and master, the landed proprietor. 'Lhe last-named alone could claim from him so many days of free labour; so much for every lamb that was born, so much for every sheep that for the first time gave milk ; every tenth animal from all the animals pos by the peasant on Christmas Eve ; a certain stipulated piece of meat from the carcase of every animal slaughtered ; and, finally, a share \u2014 Iu Alsace, at the time of the German im of 1S70, an ancient traditional caricature might have been seen, evidently the outcome of feudal times, in which the position of the peasant was still more forcibly painted.

It turned into ridicule both famine and plague, became seized with a vertigo which pathology can explain, and danced that strange Danse Macabre\u2014 dance of death\u2014 which, for the starving, was a sort of consolation ; for they were reminded that in presence of the eternal scythe we are all equal, and that tyrannical lords are mowed down equally with oppressed serfs.\" For France to issue from this period of dark ness and torture alive, though wounded, a miracle was necessary : the miracle that produced Joan of Arc. Yet when the English troops had evacu ated a good portion of the country in 1437, the year in which Charles VII. made his solemn entry into the capital he had reconquered, hunger and misery killed more than twenty thousand persons in Paris alone. hi the glorious days of the ancient regime Paris itself suffered constantly from famine, and looked for its food-supplies to the provinces and to foreign parts, whence they often failed to arrive, from the effects of brigandage or of civil ivar. d'he bad state of the roads was another obstacle in the way of this most necessary com merce ; and, worst ot all, there were laws in force by which tolls and custom dues were levied at the entrance of each town through which the provisions had to pass. In the \" Journal du Bourgeois de Paris,\" written in the reign of Charles VI., there .nstant lamentations on the exorbitant prices charged for provisions. \"Meat wa- -.. dear,\" we read in one place, \"that an ox, of which the ordinary price was eight francs, or at most ten, cost titty francs. The laws adopted fur remedying these evils were of the strangest kind. If wheat was worth eight francs the measure, it was forbidden to sell it for more than four francs ; and the bakers were ordered to sell their bread at price- corresponding with the price fixed for the wheat. The result was im mediate and inevitable. The corn-merchants I to sell, the miller- to grind, the bakers to knead, and the whole city fell into a state of distress impossible t.. describe.

But it was impossible to help them, for there was no bread, nor corn, nor wood, nor France was not alone in her suffering ; all Europe was in the same plight. The fifteenth century was a century of misery. In his \" Public Alimentation under the Ancient Monarchy,\" M. Charles Louandre remarks, with reason, that the impossibility of living, of bringing up a family, of paying taxes and dues, inspired a passion for discovery. There was a general com petition as to who should undertake the most distant journeys, the most perilous enterprises. Every unknown land seemed to be an El Dorado. People whispered to one another in the evening, beside the hearth without a fire, of countries beyond the seas where the mountains were of pure gold, where the rivers were of milk, where the animals answered to the voice of num. A search was instituted for these enchanted islands, where there was neither hunger, nor poverty, nor oppression. Diaz, Vasco da Gama, Christopher Columbus, Corte/, Pizarro, opened new paths through which languorous, exhausted, worn-out Europe might be able to reach a happier state. Each province was at that time treated as a separate state, with its own particular frontiers ; and each frontier had its custom-house, where duties were levied on all goods imported. Thus, supposing that wheat had been landed at Marseilles, in view of Paris, it would, before reaching the capital, have to pay for the right of passage at six different frontiers, without counting special levies on the way. As for Marseilles itself, however rich the harvest might be in the North of France, the great city on the Mediter ranean never profited by it. Even in the last century, Marseilles received all its grain from the Barbary States. On the famous night of the 4th of August, [789, when the abolition of all the privileges existing in France was decreed I In- . poch,\" says M.

By letters patent, dated 1505, corn was to be allowed everywhere to pass free. Richelieu, whose theory of government, cynic- the most servile courtiers could not remain blind to it. Take, for instance, the memoirs of P. de la Porte, valet de chambre to Louis XIV, which contained the following : \"Besides the mi the soldiers, that of the common people was frightful ; and wherever the Court was staying the poor peasants rushed thither, thinking they would find security, because elsewhere the army was devastating the country. They brought their cattle with them, which at once died ol hunger, because it was impossible to take thein outside for pasture. When their cattle were dead, they themselves died incontinently ; for they had nothing more to depend upon but the charity of the Court, which was of the mosl moderate kind, every one thinking of him self before all others. The mothers being dead the children died soon afterwards ; and 1 on the bridge of Melun, three children lying beside their helpless mother, one of whom was still at the breast.\" Louis XIV. was neither more- intelligent nor more humane than Richelieu. Bv his order, free circulation was again punished with A SEINE STEAMBOAT ally avowed, was that the poorer the nation the easier it would be to govern, re-established, under penalty of death, the old prohibitory edicts. The consequences were what might have been expected, and they are well expressed in a complaint made public by the Parliament of Normandy in 1033 : \u2014 \"We have seen peasants harnessed to the share like beasts of burden, ploughing the land, munching the grass, and living on roots.\" A manifesto from the Duke- of Orleans of about the same time set forth that scarcely one-third of the inhabitants of the kingdom ate ordinary bread ; one-third lived on oat-bread, while the remainder was dying of hunger, devouring grass and acorns, like animals, or, worse still, bran steeped in blood from the gutters of the slaughter-houses. To the horrors of famine must be added those of civil war. Such was the misery, that even death (1693-98). If, during the seventeenth cen tury, there were a few attempts in the way of commercial liberty, these essays were exceptional and limited to particular localities, severely cir cumscribed. The peasant was more sat upon than ever. It was ordered in 1660 that no labourer should pass from his parish to another wdthout paying double dues during a period ot two years ; and in 107: Lesdiguieres wrote thai the labourers of the Dauphine hail nothing to eat but the grass of the meadows or the bark ol tu,-.

Ducamp, \"without any previous understanding on the subject, each published, in the year 1701,"], [761, "HARDSHIPS OF THE PEOPLE. and Paris Commerce.] 313 at the bridge of Sevres, and taken back to Paris. But the tradition of that day remained with them, as was only too plainly shown during the disturbances of October, 1789. When the dauphin went to the opera, or to hunt the wolf at Marly, he was surrounded by starving bands, who cried out for food, and could only be quieted by having money thrown to them. The soldiers of the Versailles garrison went out armed, to beg and to pillage the country. Sometimes famine was created, or, at least. a book which might well have opened the eyes of the king and converted his ministers. The \"Detail de la France,\" by Bois Guilbert, and the \" Projet de Dime Royale,\" by Vauban, the famous military engineer, tire two slight volumes which showed how the safety of the monarchy might be ensured. Both authors had seen . close at hand. Struck by the misfortunes thev had contemplated, they sought a remedy for it, found it, placed it before everyone, but Mere not listened to.\" \"The common people,\" said Bois Guilbert, \" would consider themselves THE SEINE AT CRENELLE. developed, by artificial means. One ingenious speculator is said to have bought up all the corn he could afford to purchase in France, and to have exported it from the ports of Normandy and Brittany to Jersey and Guernsey, there to remain until famine had declared itself with some severity. Then the corn was re-introduced from the Channel Island- and sold at immense prices. In 1745, the Duke of Orleans walked into the Council Chamber, threw on to the table before the king a loaf made of all kinds of rubbish, and exclaimed: \"That is what your subjects have to feed upon.\" Louis XV. knew already to what a degree of misery his people were reduced.

It seemed to them that the exportation of wheat must be ruinous for the inhabitants of the districts from which it was exported, and insurrections were raised in Brie, Normandy, and the Soissons country, in order to prevent the passage of wheat from one province to another. embarked on Seine barge.-, was stopped by the militia of Louviers, and confiscated for the benefit of that town. Such scenes were renewed every where. Once within the limits of a particular province, the corn was seized and allowed to go no farther. In 1794, during a period of scarcity, Barrere proposed in the Assembly to institute a patriotic fast. \" Formerly,\" he said, \" we fasted for some saint in the calendar. Let us now fast for liberty.\" Little by little, under successive Governments, the popular prejudices against free circulation and free trade died out. There are material difficulties, moreover, in the way of such inter ference as used to be practised with cargoes and convoys in the days before the Revolution, and what, perhaps, is equally important, in the days before steam. In former times it was very easy to stop a heavily-laden, lumbering waggon, creep ing along on a bad road. It is more difficult to stay the course of a railway train. Exception ally high prices are still to be feared, but not famine. If the corn supply is insufficient in France, wheat can be imported from Hungary, Russia, and America. 1 It the famine-promoters, three were especially notorious, Foulon, Bertier, and Pinet ; and all three came to a bad end at the time of the Revolution. After the taking of the Bastille, Foulon caused a report of his death to be circu lated, celebrated his own funeral, and concealed himself at Viry. He was recognised, however, and brought back to Paris, where, received by an indignant multitude at the Barriers, he was taken to the Place de Greve, and hanged to the famous lamp-post. Then his head, with a handful of hay in the mouth, wa- carried at the end ot a pike. The horrible procession met Bertier, who was made to join it, maltreated, and put to death. This happened on the 22nd of July. On the 29th, Pinet was found in the Vcsinet Forest, with his head shattered, but still living. He declared that he had been attacked by assassins, but the general opinion was that in his terror and tie-pair he had attempted to blow his own brains out. Pinet died, and with the death of the three famous promoters the famine came, in a great measure, to an end. The Revolution, however, though it could give liberty, could not give bread ; and the distribution of corn through out the country was constantly impeded b\\ the old provincial spirit. When corn was brought in from English ports (for in those days England produced so much corn that it was able to export largely to France), the cargoes had to run the gauntlet to different provinces as they passed up the Seine. On one occasion, a quantity of wheat it at Havre for the supply of Paris, and Nor is it for bread alone that France is in debted to foreign countries \u2014 which she, in her turn, supplies abundantly with luxuries, natural and artificial, of all kinds. France receives meat and game from Russia ; vegetables, fruit, and even wine from Algeria ; oranges from Spain ; fresh-water fish from Holland, Switzerland, and Italy ; and sea-fish from England. It is a sound maxim that whatever enteis the human body should be genuine ; and in con nection with the Paris food supply a number of special officials are appointed, whose duty it is to examine the products offered to the public. The functions of these agents are not confined to the markets ; they extend to the wholt \"I Paris, to every shop in which eatables are sold ; to every cart, every barrow from which tin Paris costermonger sells fruit, vegetables, or fish.

Probably, in good neighbourhoods, food is as little adul terated in London as in Paris. Tin authorities are, in any case, much more parti cular on the subject of adulteration. With these agents for the inspection, examination, and analysis of articles of diet may be classed the officials charged with the duty of verifying weights and measures.

Before ascending the fatal ladder, he had said his last prayers in the fish-market, which had been washed and perfumed with vinegar and juniper, in order to get rid of the disagreeable smell. Between the pillory and the gibbet, a large cross stretched out its arms of stone. Beneath its shadow insolvent debtors surrendered their property, and received the traditional cap of green wool which the executioner himself placed on their heads. The bankrupts' cross and the pillory disappeared a few years before the Revo lution, in 178b ; though it is to the Revolution itself that the credit of the abolition is generally given. Private shops, however, have of course played 11,. such part in the provisioning of Paris as has fallen to the lot of the markets, which, in olden times, could only be opened and maintained by the lord of the manor. In distant times, the landed proprietor had the right of life and death over his subjects, and a few years before the Revolution, every market in Paris had its pillory, and even its gallows. It was in the king's name, however, that justice was executed ; and, in most the pillory and the gibbet of the Paris market-place were mere emblems. The Prior of the Temple, the Abbe of St. Genevieve, the Abbe of St. Germain des Pres, had each a pillory in the markets established on their territory. A word must be said about the \"market ladies,\" the \" dames de la halle,\" and the privi leges they enjoyed. It will be remembered that during a severe famine they went ill a bod}', with their starving children, to beg relief from Louis XV. At happier moments they waited upon the sovereign on some festive occa sion, to present him with congratulations and a huge bouquet. It was to their corporation that Mme. Angot and her celebrated daughter be longed. They were notorious for their freedom of speech, and little attention was paid to a police ordinance of the year 1738, which forbade them, under penalty of imprisonment and a fine of one hundred francs, to insult passers-by. But times have changed, and the manners of the \"market ladies\" with them. The royal pillory was situated at the place in the fish -market where sea-fish is now cried. It n octagonal turret, crowned by a roof in the form of an extinguisher. At the top of the turret, beneath the roof, was a horizontal wheel pierced with holes and turning on a pivot. The hole- were for the head and hands of the victim ; the wheel was put in movement, and the poor wretch was subjected, circularly and methodic ally, to the gaze of the crowd. The pillory offered an attractive spectacle to the mob; and it was there that the bodies of criminals, who had been executed at the Place tie Greve, were exposed before being hung up tit the gallows ot Montfaucon. Near the pillory stood the gibbet, here employed only under grave circumstances. On the gibbet of the fish-market was hanged Jean tie Montaigu.

The internal service of this market is entrusted to some five hundred strong men, who earn from sixty to a hundred and twenty pounds a year. These official porters form a syndicate, and offer all possible guarantees of probity, good conduct, and punctuality. Not only must they submit to a thorough examination of their private life, they are also tested physically and in the Severest manner. But they go through the regulation exercises as through a game. To the strong men is confided the duty of unloading the carts and the waggons, and carrying their contents to the stalls and shops ofthe markets. The market regulations in view of tire are very strict, espe cially those adopted and promulgated in 1865, by which smoking and the use of lucifer- and all unenclosed lights are forbidden.

Some years ago a question was raised as to whether the markets ought to be covered over ; and an answer was given in the negative- by a high official of the Prefecture, who authorita tively declared that \" bad weather was not appreciably injurious to vegetables exposed in the market-place.\" It is quite possible that turnips, carrots, and cabbages may suffer little or nothing from hail and heavy rain. But human beings may be seriously affected by in clement weather ; and in this belief it has been proposed, hitherto in vain, that covered stalls with glass windows should be constructed tor use during stormy nights. Much of the fish comes from England and Belgium. More than half of the mussels im ported into France are of Belgian origin. The Ostend oysters, so much prized at Paris, came until lately from the shores of Essex. Hut such oysters as England can still afford to export go now to Berlin, St. Petersburg, ami Vienna. The butchers' stalls are supplied by rail, and the greatest activity prevails among them after the arrival ofthe early morning trains.

Seven principal railways were now decided on, the privilege of construct- ing the lines being granted by the State on certain conditions. In England railways were being laid down by permission of the State, but not in such a way as to secure to any one of the companies a monopoly. The French legislation on the subject of railways compels the companies to extend their lines to the most remote and least populous regions. ddius, in the public interest, they have to maintain railway extensions on which the losses not infrequently eat up a serious proportion of the profits realised on the more frequented sections of the system. The great railway centre of France is, of course, the capital. \" Paris,\" says a French writer on the subject, \"being the heart, life is carried to the- extremities of France by main lines, which are the arteries ; by secondary lines, which are the veins ; anel by routes communicat- ing with the inm road, which are the capillary vessels ; in this fashion the circulation is com- plete, ddiat is a boon which must be constantly borne in mind, and which make-sour railways an absolutely democratic institution.

'Lhe companies have laid their lines wherever they pleased ; guided solely by their own interest, they have above all sought to realise immense profits. They have built rail ways between the great centres, rich or industrial, while neglecting the secondary routes, which only offered them slender gains ; they present an organisation purely aristocratic.

More than a century ago, in 171,;, ,1 royal edict forbade the construction of any more houses outside the limits of Paris as then fixed. ddiis order could not, of course, be obeyed. As well try to cheek the rising tide as to stop the growth of Paris, anel in 17*4, five years before the Revolution, we find Louis XVI.'s Minister, Calonne, obtaining a royal authorisation to sur round Paris with a new and enlarged girdle. Nineteen \" Barriers \" were now established around Paris, at each of which a duty, known as the \"octroi,\" was levied on everything brought into the city. The measure was a most un lar one, and the Farmers-General, who purchased the right of levying the tax, became the objects of popular detestation. A line which has become historical, expressed, by an ingenious verbal equivoque, the general feeling on the subject \u2014 \u25a0' Le mur murant Paris rend Paris murmurant \" ran the verse, which was repeated from mouth to mouth throughout Paris. Another epigram, which, being longer, became less popular, follows : \u2014 \" Pour augmenter son numeraire Et raccourcir notre horizon, La ferme a jug\u00a3 ne'-cessaire I le mettre Paris en prison.\"* All this might be very witty, but the Minister cared little about it.

The Barriers have not, however, completely dis appeared. They are sufficiently numerous in the present day, though thew have been put back as far as the fortifications and received the name of gates. Of the Barriers which figure most largely in history, that of Clichy stands foremost. Here, under the Revolution, the members of the Clichy Club assembled, and here in 1814 the last act of the French military and political drama was played. ddie Barriere de l'Etoile is famous as the one by which, on the 15th of December, 1 N40, the Emperor Napoleon \u2014 dead, but living in the memory of all \u2014 re-entered Paris to be re-interred at the Invalides.

It was the Prince-Royal, the Duke of Orleans, who expired in a grocer's shop on the 13th of July, 1*4::, at half-past four in the afternoon. It was at the Barriere de la Villette, on the 30th of March, 1814, that the capitulation of Paris was signed, the first article of which provided that the French troops, under the orders of the Dues ele Trevise and de Raguse, should evacuate the capital, while the last article recommended the town of Paris to the generosity ot the Allied Powi Scarcely more than a month later, 011 the 3rd of May, it was by the Barriere de la Chapelle that Louis XVIII. entered Paris, after ha\\ put his signature to the famous declaration at the Chateau of St. Ouen.

Petitions were addressed to the king requesting the aboli tion of the Barriers, and M. de Calonne's suc- declared that he would have them knocked down and the fragments sold as building-materials. Things had arrived at this point when the Revo lution of '8q broke out. The populace then set fire to some of the Barriers and knocked holes through the walls in several places, but did not touch the buildings, concerning which the National Convention subsequently issued the following decree : \u2014 \" 'Lhe national buildings designated under the name of ' Barriers ' are erected in Paris as public monuments. The various epochs ofthe Revolu tion and the victories gained by the revolutionary armies over tyrants are engraved upon them in characters of bronze. The Committee of Public Safety is authorised to take every possible measure for the prompt execution of the it decree, while inviting men of letters and artists to co-operate and to compose inscriptions.\" At this period, however, there were many obstacles between the publication of a decree and its execution, and it was not therefore astoni-hing that the famous buildings were for a time forgotten. The octroi had now been suspended, and it was not till the fifth year of the Republic that the Directory instituted a \"municipal octroi oi beneficence,\" the product of which was intended for the hospitals.

He went into society \u2014 the very best society, to which none but well-bred persons are supposed to be admitted \u2014 and lived by swindling, by clever thefts, and by card sharping. He was arrested as he was committing a robbery by means of false keys. As soon as the thief has made a good stroke, he gives away money right and left, pays his debts, lends to anyone who happens to be in need, and invites everyone to share his good fortune. He wears his heart on his sleeve, and can refuse nothing to anyone. Being constantly watched, thieves denounce themselves by their excessive expenditure, which seems to be one oi their invincible needs; and they then fall promptly into the hands ofthe police. They know that they are pursued; the theft com mitted one day may cause their arrest the day afterwards. They wish, therefore, to enjoy themselves, and they spend in debauchery the time still left at their disposal. So the pig in a shipwreck will devour food at the very moment when the vessel is sinking. Some of these malefactors would seem to be separated for ever from crime by the elevated ta-te- they profess and the intellectual occupa tions in which they are apparently absorbed. But their evil instincts are too much for them. Thus it once happened that a mathematician, versed in the highest science-, and dreaming only of abstract speculation, was condemned to seven years' imprisonment for stealing from a shop. But for the extraordinary sagacity and entire absence of illusions on the part ot the police, many a malefactor would succeed in concealing his true character. Some 3 ears ago a certain Toutpriant, living tit No. 28, Rue Vert, had eight horses in 'his stables, beside- carriages from the best makers. He was a retired clerk, who planned robberies on a large -e.de. training and directing a number of young brigands to that end, and himself living un fal-e name either on his own estate, where he bail excellent shooting, or at fashionable water ing-places. \"There are some families,\" say \\l. Ducamp, \"which, by a wretched tradition, seem given up to theft from generation to generation. The grandfather was a thief; the father stole, the son -teal.-, the grandson will steal. The child is taught his trade from the earliest years. He learns to step without making ''Pad roads end ill pitfall-,\" say the French its.

His name was Piednoir. He was not an assassin; he knew the Code, and never risked his head. He was content to commit robbery by means of false keys. But he was a past-master in his art, and from 1834 until 1 S43 escaped from the conse quences of twenty-one different warrants of arrest. He had excellent manners, led an elegant life, and bitterly regretted having had his ears pierced in his childhood, which, he said, gave him rather a common air. He employed ordin ary thieves to prepare an affair, and when everything was ready took charge of its execu tion. He then divided the plunder into shares, reserving the lion's part for himself. When his accomplices were brought to trial they behaved towards him with wonderful devotion.

Being very hungry, he contrives to steal a sausage. The first step has now been taken. Young as he is, he has acquired a fatal knowledge. He has learned how to live without working, and he is non- almost certainly lost. Vice has taken possession of him ; crime awaits him. As be gets older he is urged on by all the passions of the young man. He steals some money from his father, from his employer : wherever the chance presents itself. If he is taken, he is condemned by a compassionate judge to a brief term of im prisonment, during which he lives among the vilest. He bears nothing but the boasts of criminals, who pride themselves on their atro cious actions and inspire him with a tie-ire to imitate them. ( )n leaving gaol he meets some of his prison companions. His timid operations of former days are turned into ridicule. The talk is now of burglary, of affairs which involve some risk but return handsome profits. The crime is resolved upon. An imprudent person happens to witness its commission, calls for the police, and is killed. The little vagabond of other days has become tin assassin, and will end his career on the scaffold. Physical energy and moral weakness : such are the two principal features in the character of nearly all criminals. Some of them affect to be at war with a society in which the poor man, according to them, has no place. Mere nonsense.

Ducamp, those among whom handkerchief stealing descends from father to son. They are formidable not for their audacity, for they scarcely ever commit murder, but by their per sistence in a criminal career, by the inviolable secrecy maintained among them, their mar vellous patience, and the facilities they po for concealing themselves in the houses of their co-religionists. Jewish thieves are hardly ever at open war with society. They maintain a secret, subtle struggle. They seem to be taking a silent revenge, and it might be said that they have right on their side and that they are only taking back \u2014 as the opportunity pre- ltself \u2014 the property of which their an cestors had been so often, so violently, and so unjustly deprived by ours.

In this connection a droll anecdote may be told. A veteran Parisian beggar had a very beautiful daughter, and many a suitor petitioned the father for her hand. One day a retired soldier, who had taken to mendicancy, came to him to implore the paternal consent. \" What are your qualifications?\" asked the old man. \"I have only one leg,\" replied the amorous warrior. \"Bah !\" cried the father, \"you have no chance ; only yesterday I refused a man without either legs or arms.\" IN Paris, formerly, mendicancy was so grave and manifest a plague that it could escape the eyes . il n.. one, and there i- not a single Paris historian who ha- omitted to write upon the subject. The documents which subsist in reference to it \u2014 Par liamentary decrees, for instance, and royal edicts, would supply material for a complete history of mendicity, not only detailed but even anecdotal. There was a time when the beggars of Paris organised themselves into troops, which were under the command of a chief. The members of these troops understood their business. The orphans and other little scamps, in groups of three or four, would go out into the streets shivering and half-naked, weeping and begging for bread ; ostensible husbands and wives, with their own or other people's children, exhibited certificate- to the effect that their property had been destroyed by lightning ; the marchandicrs were merchants whom some conflagration had reduced to misery ; the pietres excelled in tying their calve- up to their thighs and proceeding legless on crutches; while the sabouleux rolled on the ground, with leaps and contortions, foaming \u2014 thanks to a piece of soap which they kept in their mouths \u2014 as though they were epileptic. In the middle ages, however, the humours of mendicancy were frequently lost in the gravity ofthe peril- to which a city infested by cunning and desperate beggars was exposed. An edict was issued in 1524 condemning mendicants to be whipped and banished. It apparently had little effect, for in the following year they were ordered to quit Paris under pain ot being hanged. In 1:32 the Parliament ordered that, chained in pairs, they should be employed to clean out the sewers, which at this period were, for the most part, open. In 1501 an ordinance of Charles IX. sentenced all beggars to the galleys during the remainder of their lite ; t\"r in those days, the offender who once found"], [775, "Parisian Mendicancy.] TREATMENT OF BEGGARS 325 himself chained to the oar never went on shore again. A Parliamentary decree of 1606 pro claimed that all beggars should be whipped in public by the assistants of the executioner ; a particular mark, moreover, was to be placed on their shoulder ; while, in virtue of an ordinance of 1602, their heads were shaved \u2014 a punishment which was at least beneficial to them from a hygienic point of view. power. Everything, however, was effected in an orderly manner, and with a facility by no means anticipated. It was announced in all the churches that, on the 7th of May, 1657, the General Hospital would be open to as many ol the poor as tic-served admission, and at the same time criers went about the streets proclaiming a warning to beggars against ever asking alms again. On the 14th of May every beggar who could be found in Paris was arrested and shut up. The city now found itself delivered from an ancient and formidable scourge. And now we reach the moment when severely punitive law- against mendicancy were about to give way to preventive measures characterised by humanity. The first person to occupy him- self with the fate of the mendicants seems to have been a certain theoretical reformer named Jean Douet de Romp Croissant. He published, in pamphlet form, a serie- of memoirs addressed to the Queen Regent. Many of the scheme.- he put forward were wild in the extreme, but his writings contain the germs of one or two excel- lent institutions. He proposed the organisation of those State pawnshops which were ultimately to be opened in France, though not until 1778. In view of the filthy condition of the Paris street-, the dangers to which pedestrians were exposed from highwaymen, and the extraordinary number of beggars then in the capital, he pro- posed to employ these beggars in cleaning the mil protecting the citizens. His idea was t\" place a beggar at every fifty yards along the thoroughfares, armed with a brush and shovel, so as to remove the refuse and to be able to call his next neighbour to the rescue should any wayfarer fall into the hands of thieves. The scheme had its practical and reasonable side, but no attempt was ever made to execute it. How complete was the delivery may be seen from the account left of their visit to Paris by two young Dutchmen \u2014 De Villers by name \u2014 who went to inspect the \" Little Arsenal de signed for the confinement of paupers accus tomed to be in the street-,\" and who, expatiating on the admirable plan and general arrangements of the institution, declared it the finest one of the kind imaginable, and that not one beggar was then to be found in Paris. In course of years, however, in spite of the General Hospital and ofthe Hotel des Invalides, opened in 1070 to indigent soldiers, mendicants once more multiplied in the streets of Paris. The French metropolis was indeed an irresist ible centre of attraction to malefactors, bonds, and beggars. Misery flowed thither not only from the provinces but from abroad. At the close of the seventeenth century a curious and ingenious ordinance was issued for prevent ing mendicancy, by which any person giving alms to a beggar was liable to a fine of fifty francs. Under regency, the famous Law put forth an emigration scheme for the clearance of vaga bonds from Paris. Authority was obtained for the transportation of indigent young men and women from the various pauper institutions to America, and numbers were shipped. The result, however, was apparently unsatisfactory, for in 1725 the Duke of Bourbon ordered that every mendicant who had come from the pro vinces to Paris should be seized, branded on the arm, and deprived of his possessions. It 1- to Louis XIV., or more correctly, to M. de Believre, first president of the Parliament, that the honour is due of having first acted in this matter with deliberation, method, and success. An edict of the 4th of May, 1656, created the General Hospital, chiefly composed of three estab- ents: Notre Dame de la Pitie ; the Mai 0 tie St. Denis or Petit Arsenal, familiarly known as Salpetriere ; and Bicetre. According to Sauval the number of beggars in Paris then exceeded forty thousand. They formed \"an independent . who knew neither law, nor religion, nor -superior, nor police ; impiety, sensuality, liber- , were all that reigned amongst them.\" Di Believre's measure was already accepted in print iple, but grave doubts were entertained respecting it- application. In the middle of the eighteenth century, recourse was again had to the scheme of Law, and beggars, particularly young and strong ones, were kidnapped for transportation to the colonies by gangs of men in the pay of the authori ties. Blunders, however, occurred. Gentlemen's servants who chanced to be out at night, as well tis the sons of artisans, were seized and carried off. And now Paris, so credulous, so ready to believe the most improbable tale-, grew terrified.

The rumour went so far as to produce riots, in which a number of the king's archers were killed and it lea-t one of the kidnappers torn to pieces. The Government now found it necessary to relinquish the emigration project, and every endeavour was made to provide mendicants with employment at home. In 176b a severe law was passed by which every mendicant caught begging was to be branded on the left arm with the letter \"M,\" and sent to the galleys for nine year.-, or for lite should the offence be repeat etl. Directory mendicants were for a time allowed to beg as they chose. They abused their liberty, however, and became importunate ami even menacing in their quest ot alms. Then they were arrested on all hands by soldier.-, who drove them outside the city with blows from the butt-end of their muskets. Once in the country, some of them got into mischief, stopped carriages and robbed pedestrians ; so that it was found necessary to issue an edict whereby any beggar bearing firearms or any kind of weapon, even though he had not made use of it, was liable to imprisonment for a period varying from two to five years, with police surveillance to follow. But rigour and leniency have proved alike powerless in Paris to relieve the city of its beggars. Mendicancy is a profession, ami it is not exercised only by extending the hand and whining for alms. It tries to disguise itself under various forms. It opens carriage-doors, sells flowers and lucifers in the streets and on the boulevards, picks up cigar-ends which it vends to illicit tobacco manufacturers at one franc a pound, sings beneath the windows of the rich, turns the handle of the barrel-organ, and lets out, at so much a day, little children to be exhibited for the excitement of public sympathy. 'Lhat the exhibition of article- for -ale from the street gutter is frequently but a pretence everyone know-. The present writer once asked a woman, who sold matches in Paris, whether a good many pedestrians did not give her the sou without requiring anything in return. \"Yes, sir,\" she replied, in a tone of lament, \" but sometimes they take the matches I \" Such heavy threat- and penalties, however, were useless.

Mendicancy is a profession, and in the exercise of it a good deal of ingenuity, and one might almost say talent, is frequently shown. Not tt iew Parisian beggars have become historical. Years ago there was a female beggar 111 P without legs and with only one arm, who . by a certain trick in her breathing, produce in her interior a sound like the tick of a pendulum. \" Listen ! ladies and gentlemen,\" she used to exclaim, \" I have a clock in my stomach !\" Her gaping auditors used thereupon to apply their ear to her back. It was true! Then clock inside her ! They could hear the click ot the pendulum 1 It was easy, however, to decree the extinction of mendicancy. Unfortunately, mendicants con tinued to exist. A sharp law was passed whereby every citizen convicted of having given any description of alms to a beggtir was condemned to a fine \"equivalent to the value of two days' work\"; whilst every person convicted of having solicited money or bread in the streets or public ways wa- liable to arrest.

It wa- a tradition in Paris that he had given his daughter a dowry of three hundred thousand francs on the occasion of her marriage to a notary, and that in the evening, after rattling his money-box all day, the old man could often be seen in a box at the opera, to which he had driven in his carriage. badge, to divine, prophesy, or interpret dreams, or to perform in public any operation which infringes on the profession of the manicure or the dentist. The profession of organ-grinder has declined in Paris. The street was his domain, and he was often accompanied by assistants in queer costumes, who grinned, gesticulated, and sang as he played beneath the windows of the well-to do. Towards 1830 one of these wanderers was well known to Parisians as \"the Marquis,\" from the costume he wore. Although upwards of fifty years of age, he was extremely nimble, and he excelled in throwing into an open window, on the fourth or fifth floor, a two-sou piece wrapped up in a small book of songs. His customer would thereupon throw him down double the amount. It was asserted by some that he belonged to the secret police, and he, in any case, rendered it important services. A blind beggar is always sure of a tolerable income, and, although he may not frequent the opera, he generally lives well. \"One day,\" says M, Ducamp in his work on Paris, \"as I was ng the Pont ties Arts, I saw a woman taking one of the blind beggars his dinner. She put into his hand a metal porringer, which he rapidly uncovered. He smelt it and asked \u2014 'What do you call this ? ' 'It is stewed mutton and peas,' replied the woman with a certain expression of fear. 'Devil take you and the mutton too ! You know I only care for beef! ' I retained my alms and kept them for a better occasion.\" How profitable a misfortune the loss of sight ha- long been to Paris beggars may be seen from a report drawn up in 1M53 on the subject of mendicancy, which sets forth that \"a number of blind beggars come to Paris just for the season, and return with enough money to live comfortably at home through the winter.\" A new organ costs from four hundred to five hundred francs, a second-hand one, with an occasional flat note, one hundred or a hundred and fifty. This is a great expense, and necess itates beforehand a capital such as few of the mendicant class possess. Most organ-grinders, therefore, hire their instrument by the day, paying for a small organ between fifty centimes and a franc ; or for a big Cremona organ, which imitates an entire orchestra, ten francs, with another two francs for the hire of the assistant in charge. Jugglers at one time abounded in the city of Paris, together with public exhibitors of all kinds ; men, for instance, whose stock-in trade consisted of a dromedary and an ape \u2014 which rode through the boulevards on the dromedary's back. These adventurers so ob structed the traffic that a series of restrictive ordinances were passed on the subject. That of February 2,Xth, 1 So;, which was based on all the preceding ordinances, provides that every individual wishing to take up the profession of . organ-grinder, singer, or perambulating musician, must be provided with an authoris ation from the Prefecture of Police.

Some of the humbler kind of organ-grinders were at one time accustomed to supplement their income in an ingenious fashion. They quitted the city under pretext of playing ill the suburban pleasure-gardens, and when they passed the barrier on their return they had replaced the pointed cylinder of their instrument with another cylinder similar in appearance and hollow, which was filled with brandy. Many of them thus evaded the octroi duty, though occasionally they were seized by the authorities and severely punished. Among the Parisian street-musicians we must not forget the orchestra-man, with a cap of lulls on his head, a flute of reeds beneath his lips, cymbals between his legs, a drum on his back, and a triangle one hardly knows where.

In London we occasionally see disinherited viscounts turning barrel-organs in the street, or repudiated younger sons on the perch of the hansom cab. This may result either from sheer necessity or from a desire on the part of the dis contented youth to make things a trifle awkward for his sire ; and we distinctly remember an earl's son who was a cab-driver taking a huge delight in plying for hire just outside the paternal mansion. \"This is a sort of commerce of which those who engage in it do not, in all probability, under stand the immorality. Everything is arranged in a regular manner, and generally before a notary : it is white slavery. A speculator runs through the villages, collects the children, whom parents are quite willing to let him have, and takes them on lease, generally for three years. All that these chidren earn, no matter where, during that lapse of time, belongs to him, and, in exchange, he gives the family a lump sum or so much annually. Formal agreements are signed, which become invalid in case of non-execution of the clauses. In Paris there have been a good many in stances of well or highly connected persons becoming street-musicians either from want or in virtue of an instinct. Quite recently there was a lady vocalist, nearly related to an influen tial Parisian, who took to the streets and could not be persuaded by her friends to resume the comforts of private life which were freely offered to her. Two or three times she was in duced to quit the streets for a day or two, but each time she found existence intolerable till she returned to the public pavement. For those in distress there is always a living, no nutter what the age of the performer, to be got out of street singing. .V few years ago an oki man of eighty weiit about Paris singing with a voice which was almost extinct and scarcely exceeded a whisper, but which, nevertheless, brought him in regularly forty-five francs a month. As to the rest, street singing is to many paupers not merely a trade, but an hereditary tendency, handed down from father to son. \"I have inspected several of these contracts. There could not possibly be more naivete or good faith than they exhibit. A father lets out his son as he lets out a field. The child is a capital, of which the produce belongs legitimately to the father. That is the principle, and it is very simple, as everyone can see. Highly immoral as it is amongst us, and contrary a- it is to all our customs, there is nothing in it to shock the in habitants of the Basilicate, for whom it becomes frequently a profitable resource. The speculators believe themselves so well within the law that often abroad, and particularly at Paris, they have recourse to their consuls in order to enforce the terms of the contract against their victims when these prove refractory. \" This industry has its agents and its traveller-. Some go to Italy in search of the children and, bringing them to Paris, place them in the hands of the patron, who is expecting them and pays lor them at so much a head. Others supply information as to the villages where children who are good musicians or who have agreeable physiognomies are to be found ; while, again, others \u2014 nor are these the least dangerous \u2014 when they learn that a ' patron ' has been expelled by some administrative measure, collect together the poor little creatures belonging to his band and work them on their own account. The largest section of the Paris street-musi cians consists, probably, of the little Italian boys who overrun public places and who are to be found at night asleep under the seats of the boulevards, against the parapets of the quays, or upon some doorstep. They are as difficult to suppress and as persistent as ants : the very police get tired of trying to clear the streets of them. Whence do they chiefly come ? We will let M. Ducamp reply : \u2014 \" One result,\" he says, \"of the expedition led by Garibaldi in 1860 was that the kingdom of the two Sicilies entered into the habits of civilised nations. Formerly, at the time of the Bourbons, as it was held that any individual demanding a passport for abroad could only be a Jacobin, permission to travel was never given. It is no longer so ; everyone can go and come at pleasure. The inhabitants of the southern province- have quickly profited by this new right in order to get rid of their children and disperse them over the whole earth. It is \" The trade is not a bad one. One patron was recently living in London with a fortune ot 200,000 francs, gained by this frightful traffic. Formerly the patrons defended their pretended rights to the bitter end, but to-day, rendered more circumspect by adverse verdicts, they take flight as soon as they feel uneasy, and aban don the children to their fate. Some tive-and twenty years ago the constantly increasing number of little Italians caused the Government"], [779, "THE ITALIAN CHILDREN. The Paris Poor.) 329 to adopt severe measures, and the patroni were all and separately informed that unless they abandoned their cruel trade they would, in virtue of a law passed in 1849, be conducted to the frontier. The effect of this notification was somewhat droll. Instead of making a complaint, either to their own Minister, to the Minister of the Interior, or the Prefect of Police, they drew up an address to the French nation, and, in a document full of sound and rhetoric and com monplace, took fare- There is a bolster at each end of the bed, and the curious visitor is surprised on entering the room to sec- heads spring up in every direction.

Some of them possess musical talent ; and these n< it only seek but know how to turn the abili- 1 heir little slaves to the best account. Others are retired brigands, or loafers on a large scale, who wish to see the world and to make money during the process. The courts have sometimes had to deal with great cruel ties on the part of the patroni. On one A l.'ASILE POUR FF.MMES, RUE FESSART, LE REFECTUIKE, occasion a man named Pellitieri was convicted for having kept a child for four days and nights fastened beneath his own bed with a harp string, which could be tightened by means of a key. The culprit was sentenced, in default, to four months' imprisonment. The life to which the poor little Italian children are condemned is a the most sordid, hateful, and demoralising kind. They suffer in health, and it has been calculated that out of a hundred children brought from Italy into France, twenty return home, thirty remain abroad, and fifty die of privation and hunger. The children earn from a franc and a half to three francs a day, all of which goes into the pocket of the patron, who has, on his side, to feed, dress, and lodge the members of his band. The little musicians pick up food wherever they can get it : often from charitable persons, and in the kitchens of restaurants or of private houses ; and this fare is doubtless preferable to that pro vided for them by their master, whose only in variable contribution towards their support is a basin of questionable soup, doled out to them in the morning before the beginning of the day's work. The children's rags have been tied or stitched together, their harps have been tuned and perhaps re-stringed, and at nine o'clock they go out into the street to carry out the instruc tions of the patron, who has told them to bring back as much money as possible, and not to allow themselves to be arrested. Some five or six hundred of these children are, in fact, arrested The streets in which they are chiefly to be round are the Rue Simon le Franc, the Rue tie la Clef, the Rue ties Roulangers, and the Place St. Victor.

As a rule, they solicit alms only in the way of business, but at times they beg directly and exclusively for their own account, as when the patron abandons them and leaves them to shift for themselves.

If the consul sends them back to Italy, they return to France under the care of some new patron, who, to keep out of difficulties, thinks it prudent to describe himself as their uncle or some other near relative. They may be sent back fifty times, but for the fifty-first they will return to Paris \u2014 a sign, it would seem, that, however miserable their life may be, they do not find it intolerable. It must be preferable, one would think, to their life in Italy, or they would remain at home. It is to be remembered, on the other hand, that their parents sell them or let them out at the rate of from a hundred to a hundred and twenty francs a year to the slave drivers called patroni. where he is generally recognised as an old acquaintance. Many of those who, at large, left to themselves, are intolerably idle, become, as soon as they are imprisoned, industrious, skilful, indefatigable workmen. Some of them will earn in confine ment a hundred or two hundred francs even more. They claim their liberty, and though everyone knows what use they will make of it there would be no justification for keeping under lock and key a man provided with enough money to enable him to seek employment. Three days afterwards the newly liberated one is again taken up for begging ; he is reminded ot the sum of money he had about him when he was set free \u2014 enough to have enabled him to live quietly and respectably for at least a month or two. \"Yes,\" he replies, \"but I have been amusing myself with my friends.\" This sort of thing reproduces itself again and again. It is more easy to improve the moral tone of a thief than of a professional beggar. The chief occupation of the beggars kept in confinement is tearing up linen to make charpie, the French equivalent toi lint. According to M. Maxime Ducamp, the incarcerated beggars work as they like ami when they like. \"They talk, read, and in the court yards smoke. < >ncc a week \u2014 every Tuesday for the men, every Wednesday for the women \u2014 they are taken out tor a walk, and often come back intoxicated. They dress as they please, and are allowed to wear moustaches and beards. . . . The beggar in Paris who falls into the hands of the police is imprisoned \u2014 not, however, a- an offender, but as an unfortunate man. An article in the penal code sets forth, in fact, that \"the beggar i- sent to the station-house for mendicants not as a punishment but as a measure ot police, to be exercised at the discretion of the adminis trative authority.\" In the first place, the man who beg- is presumably without resources. Nor is it in prison that he will be able to create new one- f..r himself. To throw him into prison, then, and afterwards set him free in the same Condition as before, would be to expose him once more to the commission of the very act for which he hail been incarcerated. Instead of doing this, the administration places the beggar, after a brief period of confinement, in a house where he is ted, clothed, and comfortably lodged, but is at the same time required to do a measure of work in proportion to his strength. For this work he is paid ; not largely, but sufficiently to enable him to amass a little sum for his immediate needs on being liberated. He will now be able to seek for work, and may perhaps manage to obtain it. This system seems admirable, and would be so as a matter of fact, were not beggars as a rule so perverse as to prefer begging to all other means of gaining a subsistence. When a beggar is arrested in the streets of Paris, he l- taken to a department of the Prefecture, Am. ing the crowds of poor wretches more than one is in a desperate condition.

The unfortunate author thought, and persisted in thinking, that his work had app so remarkable that it had been found worthy of being preserved in the archives of the Academy. He now dreamed of other poetical works, abandoned his ordinary occupation, and allowed poverty to approach him without seeing that it was at hand. ' How do you find yourself here.' I said to him, as he ate his bread with some pre paration of haricot beans. 'Well,' he replied,"], [781, "ESTABLISHMENTS FOR THE POOR.

Another asylum of the same kind is the La Rochefoucauld Retreat, installed at Montrouge, on the road to Orleans, founded by the noble and generous woman whose name it bears. Here, also, there is no admission to any one beneath the age of sixty, except only in the case ot persons suffering from incurable illnesses which are neither epilepsy, nor insanity, nor cancer. The annual payment is fixed at 250 francs for old people in good health, and 31250 francs for incurable patients. A charge, more over, is made in either case of loo francs, as representing the value of the furniture supplied. The Hospice de la Reconnaissance, opened at Garches in 1833, was founded, i.H2q, by Michael Brezin, a blacksmith and mechanical engineer, who had made his fortune under the Republic and the Empire. Here there is nothing to pay. Admission is given, by preference, to men of sixty who have been employed in some kind of metal-work. The establishment contains 300 beds. At another asylum, close to Auteuil, in the Bois de Boulogne, there is a charge of 400 francs for single persons and 250 francs for married couples. A moderate sum has to be paid for the use of furniture, and no one is admitted below the age of sixty. It will be seen that France, though in a less degree than England, suffers from the plague of mendicancy. It ha- been proposed that agricultural colonies be established (as they arc in Holland) where mendicants may be kept per manently at work. France, it is said, possesses 5,147,86s hectares of uncultivated land to which, by the railways and canals, manure might easily be brought. Artesian wells, too, may be sunk everywhere, even beneath the most sterile soil. In exchange for the labour required from the mendicants employed in tilling the land, bread would be given to them, a certain remuneration, and, it might be, a portion of the field cultivated by them. Such a system would be beneficial in more than one way. The agricultural resources ofthe country would be increased, and the towns would be freed from a parasitic race which often lends to crime its most redoubtable auxiliaries. There is no poor-law in Paris. Yet the French, like other nations, have the poor always with them ; and means have had to be found for pre venting the most unfortunate class of the popu lation from dying of hunger. Now, as in the time of Chamsort, society consists of two great classes \u2014 those who have more appetite than dinner, and those who have more dinner than appetite ; anil prudence, as well as charity, im poses the necessity of preventing the unsatisfied appetites from becoming too acute. It is only just to add that at Paris the most ancient of the asylums for the indigent owe their establish ment to charity alone. Take, for example, the Hospice des Petits Menages, founded in 1-57 on the site of a leper hospital, closed for want of funds in 1544. Certain conditions, however, were required for admission into the almshouses, known first as Les Petits Menages, and after wards as Les Petites Maisons. Admission to the At the Maison de Villas, founded some sixty years ago in the Rue du Regard by a retired merchant, old people of seventy, or indigent invalids of any age, are received to the number of fifty. In 1825, the house known as St. Michel, close to the wood of Vincennes, was sounded by a retired carpet-maker named Boular, who reserved its gratuitous privileges tor twelve old men of the age of at least seventy. Aniong the various asylums there is one which is almost celebrated, and which is luxurious com pared with the others. It is more like a very comfortable boarding-house than an establish ment reserved for the disinherited of this world. Everything has been done to deprive it of the sad aspect that belongs to most institutions of the kind. It was founded by Chamousset, whose name is associated with nearly all the charitable works as with all the most useful inventions of the 18th century, including, in the latter cate gory, the Paris letter-post. The benevolent establishment sounded by Chamousset was called neither hospice nor asile, but simply ['Institu tion Sainte-Perine. No advantage was at first taken of it until the beginning of the present century, when it was turned to a purpose little dreamed of by its benevolent author. Two speculators, Gloux and Duchaylar, discovered in establishment, by an order from the Prefecture, issued in 1801, was limited exclusively to widowers and widows of sixty whose married life had extended over at least ten years : and to marrietl couples whose united ages amounted to 130, of which fifteen had been passed in common. This asylum, however, is not, under present con- ditions, open to the indigent, but only to those poverty is relative. Each inmate, besides supplying furniture of a certain specified kind, must pay 200 francs a year for a bedroom, or 300 for a bedroom ami sitting-room.

The privileges of the establishment are reserved for state functionaries or their widows, who are admissible from the age of sixty.

Such was the careless ness of, or more probably the rapacity of, the administrators, that in 1807 the Emperor found it necessary to send the inmates provisions pre pared specially for them in the kitchen of the Tuileries. The direction of Sainte-Perine was at the same time taken from the two shameless speculators and entrusted to the Prefect of the Seine. But the almshouses, asylums, and \" retreats \" founded by a few benevolent persons could have but little effect in mitigating the distress of the Paris poor as a class. Up to the time of the Revolution, poverty was relieved by the Church, and especially by the religious houses. Private charity, moreover, was largely practised \u2014 some what on the principle of the benevolent St. Vincent de Paul, whose maxim it was that charity should \" open its arms and shut its eyes.\" In less than two years after the taking of the Bastille, on the 25th of May, 1791, a law was passed confiding the duty of relieving the wants of the poor to the municipality of The old convent has since been pulled down ; and it was replaced in 1862 by a spacious house"], [783, "ALMSHOUSES AND ASYLUMS.

The sum placed annually at the disposal of the charitable offices scarcely exceeds one million francs\u2014^\"40,000, that is to say. Under this system it necessarily follows that the sums contributed in the richer districts or arron dissements are proportionately larger than those contributed in the smaller ones; so that the bureaux have plenty of money to distribute where there is but little poverty, and scarcely anywhere the pain of poverty i- severely telt.

One by one they exhibit their certificates of indigence, to show that they tire entitled to gratuitous thug-. Even if they possess no such certificate, they receive advice ; and as medical advice without medicine would in most cases be useless, the drugs follow, even without formal authorisation. In spite of endeavours made by the central administration to equalise the resources of the different arrondissements, the position of the indigent person is much better in a rich than in a poor arrondissement. Instead ofthe regula tion fifty francs fixed as the minimum of relief to be granted to a family in distress, there are quarters where the value of the relief granted amounts to 130 francs per household. An allowance at the rate of 130 franc- a year is little enough, it will he said, for a starving family. But the object of the charitable offices is not to grant annuities for the poor. They only pro pose to help person- in temporary difficulties, such as workmen thrown out ot employment by sickness, or some other external cause. As it is, the kindly intentions ofthe administrators are often abused.

Often, alas! the spectacles, the elastic stockings, the crutches, are -old and the proceeds spent in drink. In connection with the charitable offices, two very ingenious anil beneficial measures were introduced at the time of the Restoration : one to promote the bodily, the other the mental, health of the Paris population. It was enacted that no father or mother should be held entitled to relief unless the children had been vaccinated and sent to school. This legislation was in every way beneficial to the working classc- ; for the teaching was gratuitous, while the vaccination was profitable.

Then, to facilitate matters and to save theatre-goers the trouble of making payments first at one window, then at another, the t ents were combined in one. Before many years had passed, managers easily ded themselves that it was they who, out of their own pockets, paid the theatrical poor tax. Some of them demanded that the impost snL>uld be levied not on receipts, but on profits ; and one director, on becoming bankrupt, said to his creditors as he submitted to them his accounts of profit and loss : \" I owe you 300,000 francs.

This is far from sufficient, since the expenditure in aiding and relieving the indigent and the sick is reckoned at some twenty-five millions of francs.

A DESCRIPTION of the suburbs of Paris does not enter into the scope ofthe present work. Versailles, however, imperatively claims the attention of any writer on Paris, for Versailles is more than a suburb ; it has, during the last two centuries, played almost as important a part in the annals of France as the capital itself. as the \" Day of Dupes \" took place ; on which, after a long struggle between Cardinal Richelieu and the queen-mother, Louis XIIL took part with his powerful minister. The \" I ctice,\" as the much-feared cardinal was called, gave his name to one of the most ancient streets in Versailles, the Rue du Plessis. The history of the town of Versailles is practically inseparable from that of its palace. Originally, indeed, the town was simply a de pendency ofthe palace. In spite of its numerous historical associations, Versailles is comparatively modern. It sprang tip suddenly, like the palace itself, by the will of Louis XIV. Its streets were opened and laid out so as to be in harmony with the t ' the palace, while the style and form of each building were regulated before hand by police edicts. Hence the grand but otonous aspect ofthe town. After the death of Louis XIIL, Versailles ancj the little castle of brick were abandoned 'Dy jhe court, and it was not until some twenty years afterwards that the Versailles of modern times was to arise. Strictly speaking, Versailles may be said to date from the reign of Louis XIIL, but it owed its first importance to Louis XIV. This king, says an historian, \" began by building a palace for himself ; he then built a town for his palace.\" To mark the distinction between the king and his subjects, the Great Monarch, while employing stone for his own royal residences, ordered that the houses of Versailles should be constructed exclusively of brick, or, if by ex ception stone were used, that the walls should be painted red, with dividing lines of white, so as to give them the appearance of bricks and mortar. The roof of each house y-as to be of slate, and the uniformity of the architecture, relieved by the verdure of the old trees, gave to the town a character and beauty of its own. Land was ceded to the principal members of the Court that they might build houses for themselves, and the new town grew up, as if by enchantment, on a general plan designed or approved by the king himself. The name of Versailles is derived, by some authorities, from that of an Italian nobleman, Hugo de Bersaglio, who at the end of one of ' of the Italian civil wars took refuge in France. By a familiar etymological change, the B became converted into V, and the name wa- further transformed from Versaglio into dis. Towards lhe ye.tr uoo, the pro prietor of the land, Philippe de Versailis, retired to a monastery, and the district of Versailles then passed beneath the authority of Saint-Magloire at Paris. A purely fantastic and not too ingenious derivation traces the name to \" Bles verses,\" the land at Versailles being, according to these enterprising etymologists, so high that the wind blew down the corn. To study the history of Versailles one should turn to the pages of Saint-Simon, who. in rous terms, condemns the reckless extrava gance with which Louis XIV. wasted on a pleasure-residence money urgently wanted for the maintenance of his trooj Henry IV. had a small hunting-box at Ver sailles, and Louis XIIL had another on a far more magnificent scale, which Saint-Simon in hi- \"Memoirs\" describes as a castle. It square building with a courtyard in the middle, and, according to the fashion of the time, was built of brick. The king's horses and carriages kept at a neighbouring farm. It was at Versailles, on the nth of November, 1630, that the memorable day known in French history \" When all had been finished,\" says the duke, \" it appeared that water was everywhere wanting; and this in spite of the millions which had been spent in establishing seas of reservoirs on mud and moving sand. Who would have thought it ? This lack of water proved the ruin of the king's infantry. Madame de Maintenon"], [789, "SAINT-SIMON'S ACCOUNT OF VERSAILLES. Versailles.] 339 was in power. The minister, De Louvois, was on the best terms with her, and we were at peace. It occurred to him under these cir cumstances to turn the course of the river Eure between Chartres and Maintenon, and to con duct it to Versailles. Who can say what gold and what suffering this experiment cost us ? It was forbidden under the severest penalties to speak, among the troops employed to turn the stream, about the sickness, the deaths caused by the exhalations from the ancient bed of the river. How many took years to recover from the contagion ! How many never regained health at all ! The officers, colonels, brigadiers, and others employed were not allowed, whoever they might be, to absent themselves for a quarter of an hour, nor to rest for a quarter of an hour at their work. so much as Marly : and if one adds the expense of continual journeys, particularly towards the end of the king's life, Marly cost billions. Such was the fortune of a repository of snakes and carrion, spiders and frogs, only chosen because the expense would be nothing! \" Such was the bad taste of the king in everything and his keen passion for forcing nature, which neither the most pressing war nor his devotion could blunt ! \"The establishment of the Court at Versailles was another instance of the king's policy. We all know how he derided, humiliated, confounded the very first grandees, gave pre-eminence to ministers, whom he promoted to equal authority and power with princes of the blood and to an importance exceeding that of the foremost noble men in the land. It is necessary to show the progress in every direction of such policy on the part of the king. Several causes contributed to draw the court out of Paris, and to keep it incessantly in the country. \" At length the king, tired of glitter and of the crowd, persuaded himself that he wanted occasional solitude : he accordingly set out for the environs. People pressed him to stay at Lucienne ; he replied that this happy situation would ruin him, and that, as he wished for absolute rest, he must seek a situation which would permit him to do nothing. \"The troubles of the minority, of which this city was the great theatre, had inspired the king with an aversion for it : and people had per suaded him that his stay there was dangerous, and that the residence of the court elsewhere would render cabals at Paris less easy 'through sheer distance, and more difficult to hide through the with which absences could be remarked. \" He found behind Lucienne a deep and narrow valley, with steep sides, inaccessible by its marshes, commanding no view, shut in by hills, and with a wretched village built on its sides. It was called Marly. This enclosure had its advantages ; its narrowness kept a resident within bounds. It was an enormous task to dry up the sewers into which the surrounding parts poured their refuse ; but at length the hermitage was prepared. Yet the king only slept there for three nights, from Wednesday to Saturday, two or three times a year, with a dozen courtiers at the most. By degrees the hermitage was enlarged. The hills were levelled to afford space for building-sites, and a large portion of the one at the extremity carried away to produce at lettst the glimpse of a landscape view. \"The number of his mistresses, and the danger of creating great scandals in the heart of ti capital so populous and full of such turbulent spirits, now induced the king to remove farther aw. iv. At Paris he found himself importuned by the crowd every time he went out, came in, or showed himself in the streets. . . . A passion for exercise and the chase, much more easy to gratify in the country than at Paris, remote as it was from forests and sterile in places of promenade, and the love of buildings which came next and constantly grew, forbade to him the amusements of a town where he could not avoid being continually on view. The idea, moreover, of rendering himself more venerable by abstracting himself from the eyes of the multitude and from daily appearance in public, was one of the considerations which decided the king to fix upon Saint-Germain, soon after the death ofthe queen, his mother. \" Finally, what with buildings, gardens, lake-, aqueducts, parks, forests, statues, etc., Marly ie what one sees it to-day, despoiled as it ..n since the death ofthe king.

He turned his gaze to right and left on rising and going to at his meals, on passing through chambers, in the gardens of Versailles, or where courtiers alone were privileged to follow him. He saw and noticed everybody : no one escaped him \u2014 not even those who would never have hoped to attract his eye. He carefully observed the absence of those belonging to the court, and of the visitors who came more or less frequently ; noted the general or particular causes of such absence, and, recording these in his memory, ne-ver missed the slightest opportunity of acting in consequence of them. \" It was a demerit in some, and in all whom he had favoured, not to make the court their ordinary residence ; in others a demerit to visit it rarely ; and it was a sure disgrace never to visit it at all. When it became a question of doing something for such persons, he would say, of this last class, in a lofty tone, ' I do not know them;' and of a rare visitor, 'He is a man I never see.' These words were irrevocable. It was another crime not to go to Fontainebleau, which he regarded like Versailles. He could not endure people who were fond of Paris. He could easily put up with those who loved the country places to which they belonged, though thew had to take care to moderate their ex pressions of this local affection, and, moreover, before going to stay in the country, to make a longer sojourn at the court. This was not confined to office-bearers or favourites, nor to those whom their age or their capacity marked out from others ; anyone frequenting the court was liable to be called to account for his destina tion. To such a point did the thing go that during a journey I made to Rouen about a law -suit, the king caused a letter to be written to me, young as I was, by Pontchartrain, to demand the reason.\" Of the magnificence of Versailles under Louis XIV. many records remain. A vivid description of one of the most gorgeous fetes ever held is contained in a letter which was addressed at the time by an eye-witness to the Marquis de la Fuente. Nothing grander than this fete could have- been devised even by Louis XIV., who offered it to his courtiers and subjects in 1668. \"The day appointed was the iSth of this month,\" says the correspondent, who in July of the year named was writing to the marquis by to Versailles \u2014 a little cardboard castle at that time, built by Louis XIIL, himself disgusted, and his suite -till more so, at having had to sleep in a vile inn frequented by waggoners, or in a windmill, after long, fatiguing hunts iu the forest of Saint-Leger, or even beyond that, and re served for his son at a period far distant, when roadways, the fleetness of trained dogs, and the skill of a large staff of keepers and huntsmen had rendered the chase easy and short. This monarch never slept at Versailles, or at least, very rarely, pa-sing a night there only from necessity. \" The king, his son, in order to be more in private with his mistress, was there more often. Then its unknown pleasures, its little parties, caused the immense edifices to spring up which have been built there, with their accommoda tion for a numerous court, so different from the residences at Saint-Germain. Finally he transported his entire household to it, pre viously to the death of the queen, and built an infinitude of abodes there in compliance with the petitions made to him on the subject ; whereas at Saint-Germain almost everyone was put to the inconvenience of staying in the town ; those few who were lodged at the castle being terribly cramped for room there. \" Frequent fetes, select promenades at Ver sailles, and journeys were the means seized upon by the king for distinguishing or mortifying, according to the part he assigned to those par ticipating in such ceremonies ; though he took care that everyone without the slightest differ ence should be assiduous and attentive to please him.\" Marly was afterwards much used by him as well as Trianon, where absolutely everyone could come and pay court to him, but where ladies alone had the honour to eat at his table. The wax candle which every evening he caused to be held by some courtier whom he wished to distinguish, and the brevet-doublet, were two more of his inventions. This garment was lined with red, and embroidered with a mag nificent and unique design in gold with a little silver. Only a limited number could wear it, including the king, his family, and the princes of the blood ; and the latter, like the rest of the courtiers, could only obtain possession of such doublets as they were vacated by their previous holders. The most distinguished members of the court, either directly or by favour, de manded them of the king, and it was a great honour to receive one. \" Not only (says Saint-Simon) was the king"], [791, "THE GRAND FETE OF JULY, 166.8.

The whole aristocratic world, Parisian and provincial, together with many persons who had crossed the sea in the suite of the Duke of Monmouth, had assembled there ; never was a gathering so numerous, so select, so sumptuously adorned. The king, wishing that on this evening, when the sweetness of the air invited people out of doors, they followed the queen into the garden, where carriages were in waiting to convey them towards one of the woods which lie to the right as you enter, and which has about it something more solitary and more mysterious than the others.

To a vast audience the troop of Moliere played one in his style, new and comic, and agreeably varied with ballet music. \" The first table was bounded, at that end of it which rested against the basin, by a mossy bank covered with truffles and mushrooms, six different entrees garnishing the table, of which the re mainder, like a fertile valley, was strewn with salads and green stuff. \" The second table had at one end of it, as though in perspective, an architectural fabric of pastry, the rest of the table being furnished with pies and other produce from the oven. \" The third was terminated by pyramids of dried preserves, the rest of the table looking like a flower-bed through a skilful arrangement of almond cakes and stewed fruits. \" Darkness had now crept upon us ; but although night arrests the operations of nature, she is no enemy to pleasure, and on this occasion spoiled nothing by her arrival. People almost wished she had come sooner ; the shadows were blessed, partly for the freshness of the air which they brought, partly for the obscurity which enhanced the brilliancy of the jewels, partly because they announced the hour of supper, to which hunger had already looked forward. Everyone began to think seriously of this meal, though no one fancied that Her Majesty was preoccupied with it when she invited the com pany to go to the other side of the garden and visit a kind of enchanted palace, so rare and so singular that writers of fiction have imagined nothing like it.\" \" The fourth seemed to spring out of a rock where nature had commenced to form divers crystals, the remainder of the table being laden with crystal vases full of all sorts of iced waters. \" The fifth was bordered by a heap of caramel- similar to that shapeless mass of amber which the sea sometimes throws up on shore, and the- table was covered with porcelain vessels full of cream. \" All this was due more to the magic of fairies than to human industry. As a matter of fact, no one could be seen in the place when the company entered; and even during the repast you only got half a glimpse of the hands which through the foliage presented, on handsome salvers, beverages to till who wished to drink. For some time the feast was simply contemplated with wonder ; but at length temptation over came scruple, and the assembly set themselves to eat all these things as though they had never believed them enchanted. An elaborate description of this structure follows, and then the supper is described. To avoid confusion, the invited guests were divided up into nine bands, and the respective tables at which they sat were each presided over by some lady of rank. The first was graced by the presence of the queen. To this table only the princesses of the blood were admitted. Other tables were beneath the charge of the Countess de Soissons, the Princess of Baden, the Duchesse de Crc-quv, and a number of other distinguished ladies. Besides tin- accommodation, which was only for invited lady guests, there were, continues the correspondent, \"a great number of tables laid in the different avenues where anyone who wished could eat ; and in the grotto which, as you know, is the most charming spot tit Ver sailles, three tables of thirty covers each had been laid for the ambassadors.

At the time of the Druids one would have taken this structure for the palace where they de livered their judgments, or for the temple ofthe gods presiding over the forests.

This terrible and surprising spectacle troubled and fascinated the sightseers. There are horrors which please, and the soul athirst for novelty seeds on what astonishes it. Whilst people were eagerly re velling in these visions, they were suddenly aroused by claps of thunder, often redoubled, accompanied by an infinitude of lightning flashes and fires which, darting towards the heavens like rockets or hovering in the air like stars, burst to pieces or sell into some lake where they rekindled themselves instead of being extinguished, or, finally, creeping along the ground like serpents, augmented the horrors of darkness by dissipating it, and seemed to threaten the universe with its last conflagration. Nevertheless, we soon recognised the ingenious imposture of these phantoms of light which had dazzled us, of this artificial thunder by which we had been so astonished. \"Good cheer does not usually inspire melan choly thoughts ; gaiety shone upon all faces, and still more of it was concealed in each heart. The evening was cool, and the company were longing for a dance. In this disposition the king directed the company to a superb saloon where everything was ordered so regularly, where the ornaments were so natural and so gorgeous, and the place so vast and new, that it was easy to see that this must be the work of the architect of the Louvre \u2014 of a man, that is to say, accustomed to great designs and to the most noble idea-.\" After a description of the magnificent saloon in question, the correspondent adds : \" I will not speak of the pomp of the ball, or the grace of the Majesties, nor of the beauty and personal ornament of those who danced ; I will leave you to imagine the scene. \" .

The Regent cared only for Paris, and neither lived at Versailles himself nor allowed the heir to the throne to live there. Occasionally he visited the place ; and Peter the Great, on visiting Paris, was put up for a time at Trianon in the Versailles park. The Tsar of Muscovy arrived in Paris from Holland (he had not yet been recognised by Europe as Emperor of Russia) on the 8th of May, 1717, and remained partly in the capital, partly tit Versailles, for upwards of six weeks. \"But scarcely had the company emerged from the thick of the wood and arrived at the first bed, where a moment before we had seen nothing but fountains and flowers, when our eye- were startled with the strangest and most illumination that could possibly be conceived.

When this prince visited St. Cyr, he was received like the king. He wished to see Madame de Maintenon, who, suspecting that his chief desire was to see how old she looked, determined to receive him in bed. Her conjecture proved correct. On entering the room, the Tsar drew aside the window-curtains, and then the curtains of the bed, which Madame de Maintenon had closed, with the exception of one which remained half-drawn, looked at her attentively without saying a word or going through any form of civility, and then went away just as he had come. The Regent, having taken the Tsar to his grand box, and Peter, in the middle of the piece, having asked for some beer, the Duke of Orleans, standing up, presented to him a glass on a saucer. The Russian prince received it with a graceful gesture, drinking the contents and putting back the glass on the saucer, which the Duke of Orleans, always standing, held in his hand, afterwards offering the Tsar a napkin in the same manner.

Versailles was the scene of the strange intrigues known collect ively as \" the affair of the necklace,\" and it was at Versailles that the king and queen were openly threatened by the revolutionary mob. while, she pretended that she had delivered the necklace to Marie Antoinette, and she succeeded in concealing her robbery for several months by producing fictitious notes in handwriting imitated from that of Marie Antoinette. At last a direct application was made by the jewellers to the queen herself, which resulted in a public trial before the Parliament of Paris. The affair caused the greatest excitement throughout France. There was no evidence which really told against the queen, and all that could be urged against the cardinal was that his folly and fatuity had enabled the Countess de Lamotte to make him an easy dupe. De Rohan, then, was acquitted, while the countess was sentenced to be whipped, branded on the shoulder, and imprisoned for life. After two years confinement at the Sal petriere, she escaped in June, 1787, and fled to London, where she published scandalous libels against the queen. In spite of her innocence, Marie Antoinette was suspected by the common The affair of the diamond necklace was turned to the disadvantage and grave injury of the queen by all her enemies, though it is certain that Marie Antoinette had nothing whatever to do with the matter. A certain Countess de Lamotte-Valois was the prime mover in the affair, and she acted throughout with an in genuity which surprised the good faith of many. Born in a comparatively humble position, she became the wife of a dissipated and ruined count ; when, determined to turn her newly acquired posi tion to account, she went to Paris, where she succeeded in get- ting presented to Marie Antoinette and also to Cardinal de Rohan, the king's grand almoner. She persuaded the car- dinal, that to secure the eternal gratitude of the queen it was only neces- sary to obtain for her a necklace worth a million and a half francs which was in the possession or the court jewellers. De Rohan, moreover, was assured that the queen entertained for him the most tender affection, and, in order to carry conviction to the car dinal's mind, a Mile. d'Olivia, who much re- THE GALLERY OF BATTLES, VERSAILLES. {From a Photograph by A'., Paris.) sembled Marie Antoinette, was induced to personate her at a midnight interview with His Eminence in the gardens of Versailles.

He delayed, however, ordering an advance until four o'clock in the afternoon. He wished, as Mr. Morse Stephens puts it, \"to be the saviour of the king, and it would not be sufficiently glorious to forestall the danger.\" The news that a mob was marching on Ver sailles reached the king while he was hunting. Receiving the intelligence with his usual indiffer ence, he nevertheless went back to the palace, where he found the body-guard, six hundred strong, and the Regiment of Flanders drawn up in order of battle. About two hundred of the National Guards at Versailles had taken up their position tit si une distance from the troops, but with no intention of assisting them. The women of Paris arrived between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. Some went at once to the palace and demanded food, which was readily given to them. Versailles had been made the meeting-place of the National Assembly, and the first French Parliament (not, of course, to be confounded with the judicial Parliament of Paris) was engaged in ti debate when Maillard, representing the conquerors of the Bastille, entered the hall and demanded, on behalf of the women, that the price of bread should be lowered by a formal decree. 'Lhe Assembly appointed a deputation of it- own members to accompany a deputation of the women to the king. The deputations were most graciously received. But this only increased the difficulty ; and on returning to their sisters, the women who had waited upon the king were furiously attacked for having condescended to such a step. Towards evening the royal travelling-carriages were seen issuing from the stables ; and the cry at once arose that the king must not be allowed . ape. Several of the Versailles National Guards rushed forward and insisted on the carri.e g driven back. An hour afterwards the body-guard, which was to have accompanied the king in his flight, retired to their barracks. As they did so they were fired upon by the National Guards of Versailles, and one ot their horses was killed. It was immediately masted and eaten by the Parisian mob. The people of Paris entertained the gravest distrust of the king and queen. As the crisis was drawing near the queen entreated her hus band to leave Versailles for Compiegne or Fon tainebleau. She counted, above all things, on the Marquis de Bouille, who commanded the troops on the eastern frontier, with headquarters at Metz. The Comte d'Estaing, commanding the National Guards at Versailles, was ready not only to aid the escape of the royal family, but, if necessary, to protect their flight ; and the municipality of Versailles had empowered him to act freely against any movement made from Paris upon Versailles. It was essential to secure operation of the king's body-guard and of the Versailles garrison; and with this view the king, queen, and royal family assisted at a grand banquet given on the 1st of October by the king's body-guard to the Regiment of Flanders in the theatre of the Palace. 'Lhe population of Paris saw in these marks of goodwill towards the troops proofs of treachery. The excitement led to insurrection, and Versailles was invaded by the Parisian mob. On the 15th of October, at six in the morning, the tocsin was sounded in Pari-. 'Lhe National Guards quickly assembled, and a market-woman collected other market women around her by beating a big drum. The women were animated less by political itleas than by a determination, by all possible means, ti 1 -ave their children from starvation. They had been told that there would be bread enough in Paris if the king and queen were there. Several volunteers belonging to the band which had played a leading part in taking the Bastille placed themselves at the head of the infuriated women and of the rabble who accompanied them. In the rear marched the conquerors of the Bastille in a body ; not, it was said, to co operate with the women, but, if necessary, to protect them. The municipality of Paris ordered General Lafayette to take measures in view of the threatened conflict; and, calling out the force distinctively known as the \"paid battalion\" \u2014 At last, toward- eleven o'clock, Lafayette arrived with the greater part of the National Guards of Paris, the paid battalion, and guns. He at once sought an interview with the king, and after assuring linn of In- power and willin. protect him, called upon him to accept the \" Declaration of the Rights of Man.\""], [797, "Versailles.] THE EVENTS OF OCTOBER, 1780. 347 The king complied, and Lafayette, thinking, or pretending to think, that peace had been secured at least for the night, retired to his hotel. About five o'clock the next morning a portion of the mob, after supping on horseflesh and wash ing down the unaccustomed food with plentiful libations, had got into the gardens of the palace, and, finding a back-door unguarded, forced their way towards the queen's apartments, killing, as they did so, two of the body-guards who defended the ante-chamber and staircase. Two other body guards, however, defended her bed-chamber until she had time to escape by a private staircase to the king's own room. The noise of the fighting brought up the paid battalion of the Paris National Guard, who in a few minutes cleared the palace of its invaders ; and at about seven o'clock Lafayette came upon the scene. He persuaded the king, queen, and royal family to appear on the balcony, where they were greeted with shouts, \" Le roi a Paris ! \" and after a brief parley with the king, the popular general an nounced that the king had accepted uncondition ally the Declaration of the Rights of Man, and that he would start that afternoon for the capital. \"Maillartl,\" says Mr. Morse Stephens, \"with a body of followers, including men carrying the heads of slaughtered body-guards, started off at once to take the good news to Paris, where he was warmly received by the municipality. At a little past one the royal carriages left Versailles, and late in the evening, escorted by Lafayette on his white horse, the Parisian National Guards and the mob, reached the capital. 'Lhe royal family first went to the Hotel de Ville, where thew had to listen to an harangue from Bailly, and then went to the Tuileries, which had been so long unoccupied that there were not even sufficient beds to sleep in. Thus ended the memorable days of October 5 and 6, 1789, to the great glory of General Morpheus, as the royalists called him, and to the real destruction of monarchical power in France.\" The Assembly had originally taken up its quarters at Versailles in order to be free from all pressure on the part ofthe Paris population. It now debated under the eyes of the Parisians, who were able to influence its deliberations in more ways than one. The hall set apart for it at Versailles had presented some material incon veniences. It was so large that the speeches of members were sometimes inaudible ; and another disadvantage (which surely might have been prevented) is said to have been that the im mense size of the hall allowed strangers to enter, interrupt the debates, and occasionally even vote. It was only by express order of the king, after he had taken up his residence at the Tuileries, that the National Assembly forsook Versailles for Paris ; and it now established itself in the Manege, or Riding School, an ob long building some 240 feet in length by 60 feet in width, situated on the north side of the Tuileries Gardens, just where the Rue de Rivoli now joins the Rue Castiglione. When the necessary alterations had been completed, it was found that the new- building was much better adapted for the debates than the immense hall tit Versailles. Even at the Manege there was plenty of room ; and the Assembly having magnanimously invited \" the whole nation \" to be present at the debates, the galleries were crowded all day by the people of Paris, and especially by women of all classes, who took the keenest delight in the proceedings, applauding or hissing as they thought fit. Fruit-seller- ami newspaper-girls wandered about with discordant cries, so that the galleries resembled in many respects the gallery of a theatre.

Within the city boundary all was movement, animation, fever. Gun-carriages were passing to and fro freighted with enormous cannon; other pieces of ordnance were lying in the interior ot the bastions, awaiting their frames. On the parapets guns already mounted were established in hollows dug out for the purpose, Two million bags of earth were piled up, from behind which the defenders could fire in safety upon the foe. In the forts the same activity, the same preparations might be observed. Six were occu pied by the marines. As the French fleet could play only a very insignificant part in this war, these men, with their guns of long range, were summoned from the sea-ports ; and they were destined to render their country splendid ser vices in the capital. With marvellous rapidity they fitted their own forts with cannon and earthworks. At the beginning of the war the artillery were terribly short of arms. By the regulations each bastion shouhl have been provided with eleven pieces. At that time there were only three to reply to the Krupp guns of the foe. By way of reserve, Paris was habitually furnished with two parks of artillery, each consisting of 250 pieces: but not one piece remained, the whole supply haying been sent eastward, ddie ammunition for the cannon was terribly limited, being only sufficient to afford the guns ten shots apiece. The lack of artillerymen was even more lament able ; in some forts the entire force consisted of a man in charge of the battery. Towards the middle of October, however, the numbers of the artillery were rapidly raised to 13,000 officers, tinder-officers, and soldiers, thanks to the patriot ism of retired officers of the marines and of the Gardes Mobiles of the Seine, the Seinc-et-Oise, the Drome, the Rhone, the Loire Inferieure , and the Pas-de-Calais. By this time, too, 2,140 cannon had been mounted at the city boundaries, and the in adequate supply of powder had been increased After Sedan, the enemy hastened to Paris, well knowing that the occupation of this town, at once the head and the heart of France, would put an end to all resistance throughout the country. From the moment that intelligence was received of the German advance upon the capital, the new Government gave a fresh impulse to the works of defence commenced under the Regency ; and gigantic efforts were necessary to arm the fortifications at such short notice. To defend the whole of the works around Paris a hundred thousand men were necessary. But Paris could muster three or four hundred thousand National Guards, animated by the most ardent patriotism, invincible behind their ramparts, and of which a select portion could face the enemy's fire with the intrepidity of old troops. It was they who went to guard the ninety-four bastions forming a continuous girdle round the city. Paris was in a bubbling ferment of patriotism : everyone, young or old, rich or poor, hastened to have his name inscribed and to ask for a rifle. Agitation reigned everywhere, yet without producing the least disorder. Already, on the 19th of August, a committee of defence for the fortifications had been formed, composed of distinguished military officers and statesmen ; and under the direction of this committee between sixty and seventy thousand men were employed to organise the resistance on the ram parts, where everything was deficient. All the gates of Paris were isolated from their approaches by the prolongation of the moat, drawbridges being now utilised. Beyond the moat, obstacles ot all kinds were heaped up to arrest the assail ants \u2014 branches of trees, broken glass, planks bristling with nails, and so forth : useless and almost infantine precautions, considering the"], [799, "the Siege of Paris.] 349 THE ADVANCE OF THE PRUSSIANS six-fold. The director of all this prodigious activity was the indefatigable Minister of Public Works, M. Dorian, whose services, moreover, uring the water supply were altogether invaluable. Whilst such enormous progress was being made with the works of defence, the enemy was the reverse of idle. Its columns, meeting no stock of provisions as his resources would allow : rice, vermicelli, macaroni, potatoes, hams, sugar, coffee, vanished in a twinkling from the grocers' shops. Yet the purchasers knew better than to eat freely of their provisions. They could not tell how- long the siege would last. -Meanwhile the Prussians advanced, the more rapidly from feeding confident that no force could GENERAL TROCHU. obstacle on their way, were rapidly marching towards Paris. The news of their approach redoubled the activity of the Parisians. Every- where in the capital warehouses were improvised in which were heaped up waggon-loads of hay and straw, sacks of corn, and provisions of all kinds. The church of Notre Dame des Champs was turned into a forage-depot : in front of the Militaire a large supply of mill-stones was placed, in view of grinding the corn. The streets constantly traversed by immense herds of oxen and flocks of sheep, which were about to Lied and penned mi the exterior boulevards, in the open spaces, and even in the avenues ot the Luxemburg. Everyone laid in as large a bar their passage and from being familiarly ac quainted with the country. High-roads, country lanes, the veriest footpaths, were known to them, for in their ranks, to quote the words of a French historian, \" was that crowd of Germans who had so long eaten the bread of France, and who were now guiding the invaders. We had thought them our guests, when they were simply our spies.\" On the nth of September the Prussians were reported to have arrived at La Ferte, on their way to Meaux ; at Rebais, Coulommcres, Crecy, and even beneath the walk of Soissons. On the I 2th they entered Nogeiit-sur-Seine and Prov ins, where the railway-stations were aban doned in all haste. On the 14th the telegraph"], [800, "PARIS, OLD AND NEW. 350 lies and wires were cut between Melun and Mormant ; and Prussian lancers, the so-called Uhlans \u2014 the name being borrowed from the lancers of Poland \u2014 showed themselves in the last-named town. On the 1 5th a train fell into the hands of the Prussians as it arrived at Senlis ; and on that same day the stationmaster at Join ville tele graphed to the Minister of the Interior \u2014 \" Enemy to the number of about 10,000 marching upon Joinville. Our troops are concentrating on the forts. In an hour the enemy will be here.\" Almost at the same time the Governor of Paris received the following despatch from Vincennes : \" The Uhlans are between Creteil and Neuilly sur-Marne. At this last point what seems to be the advanced-guard of the column reported this morning. Are informing and summoning everyone.\" Paris now clearly understood that the enemy was marching upon it, and in proportion as the Prussians narrowed the circle of iron with which they were surrounding Paris, the inhabitants hurried from all sides to the capital, accom panied by carriages laden with furniture hastily got together, with such articles of value as they had had time to bring away. \" It was a sad procession,\" says a writer who witnessed the seene. \" ddie unhappy fugitives were abandoning their peaceful homes to an enemy who would destroy them. In what condition will they find on their return the house and the little garden, the- grass plot and the beds of flowers in which they took so much delight ? \" As a matter of fact, the deserted houses were the very ones, and probably the only ones, that were plundered anel devastated. Where a proprietor or his repre sentative, even if it were only a servant, had been left, so that the foreign visitors could be accommodated and their needs attended to, things went on in a sufficiently regular manner. But where no responsible person had been left in charge, the soldiers, all of them young men of from twenty to twenty-seven years of age, used, in their rough play, the legs of chairs as missiles, and fragments of furniture of all kinds as fire wood. In some suburban towns, Villeneuve, Saint-Georges, for instance, the houses occupied by successive detachments were before long a terrible scene of destruction \u2014 chairs, tables, and looking-glasses all smashed to pieces. In houses, on the other hand, where the owner or his sub stitute remained, no damage was done. In some cases the work of demolition was due not to recklessness and wantonness alone, but also to anger, the German invaders feeling indignant, they said, at being regarded in the light of barbarians. Then, as if to prove that they were not savages, they behaved with a certain savagery. It was on the 17th of September that Villeneuve, Saint-Georges, and Choisy-le-Roy were for the first time occupied, the object of the occupation being to get possession of the lines to Lyons ami ( >rlc. 111s and dominate the course of the Seine so as to establish communications with Versailles, which was to be the headquarters of the in vading army. The Prussians advanced without fear, knowing well that with the exception of a strong division commanded by General Vinoy, which had advanced from Mezieres to Paris the day after the battle of Sedan, there were no regular troops to oppose them. 'Lhe line of investment was, in the first instance, very thin, and it is said that some observation on the subject was made to Moltke by a member ot his staff. \" General Trochu could break through it, no doubt,\" Moltke replied, \" but he will not try.\" On the 1 8th of September, it was reported that the Germans were approaching the walls of the capital in three large bodies, and the public was informed, through the columns of the official journal, that it must not be surp if no further telegraphic communications reai hi d it from outside. Lhe same evening a number of dull, distant detonations were heard. The bridges of St. Cloud, Sevres, and Yalltmcourt had been blown up. Paris was being gradually cut off from the rest of France, from the rest of the world. No more communications, no more despatches, no more news of any kind. The only means of correspondence- left to the great city was by way ofthe air. Genertil Trochu, Governor of Paris, had plenty . of troops, or at least of armed men, under his command. The number of regulars, scarcely more than thirteen thousand, which General Vinoy had brought from Mezieres, was small indeed ; but these, with National Guards, Gardes Mobiles, and volunteers of various kinds, made up an entire force of 400,000, nearly twice the number of the besiegers. It may not be generally known, but it is nevertheless the fact, that just after the battle of Sedan, when the Prussians were already advancing upon Paris, the command of the Paris forts was offered to General Ripley, who had distinguished himself during the American Civil War by his energetic defence of Charlestown. The general visited Paris, was perfectly satisfied with all the material prepara tions, but had no confidence in the National"], [801, "THE FRANCS- T1REURS. the Siege of Paris.] 351 Guards, whose slovenly appearance, absence of discipline, and, above all, want of respect for their officers, impressed him very unfavourably. It must be remembered, however, that Paris had but few regular troops in its garrison, only, in fact, the division which, the day after Sedan, General Vinoy had conducted from Mezieres, in the immediate neighbourhood of Sedan, to the capital. Plenty of brave men, moreover, hail joined the army as volunteers at the beginning of mpaign ; and Paris had furnished a large proportion of the Francs-Tireurs who rendered such questionable service to the national cause. \"What a villain,\" says a writer cm this subject, \" was the Franc-Tireur in the eyes of the Prussians, who regarded him as a poacher of the worst kind, shooting men without a licence ; and what a hero in the eyes of his own country men, and, above all, countrywomen, wh in him the ideal of a patriot ! \" \" Who are these Francs-Tireurs ? \" a Frenchman was one day asked by the present writer, at that period one of the war correspondents of the Times. \" Young men of good education who wish to defend their country,\" he replied. \" Who are the Francs- Tireurs ? \" the same correspondent inquired of a young French lady. \" Charming young men, and as brave as lions,\" she replied ; \" I have the portrait of one ofthem in my brooch.\" of a lower type : there were escaped prisoners, 1 rs. and fugitives, the last remnants of the great armies that had from time to time been cut in pieces, and the amalgam formed by these different elements was doubtless not a nice one. Even the gentlemanly Franc-Tireur, if fallen into bad circumstances, might be a dangerous person to meet; he would be ashamed to show himself in the character of a robber, and from sheer self-respect might begin by killing his victim. The Prussians, however, could not, like the young ladies of France, distinguish between the noble-minded Franc-Tireur and the Franc- Tireur who was a mere cut-throat. What they required was that he should carry papers showing that he belonged to some regularly organised corps, that he should wear a uniform re cognisable at gun-shot distance, and that the distinctive marks of the uniform should be \" inseparable fr mi the person.'' Let him comply with these conditions, and the Franc-Tireur, if I into the hands of the enemy, instead of being shot or condemned to ten years' imprison ment, was treated as a prisoner of war. It seems hard to insist that William Tell shall put on a uniform \" ri ile at gun shot distance,\" and that the distinctive signs of the uniform worn by Masaniello shall be \" in separable from the person \" ; but if William 'Lei! - like a civilian he places his enemy at a notable disadvantage, and the same may be said of Masaniello, if Masaniello has nothing military about him but his cap, which he can get rul of at a moment's notice and replace by a wide awake or a cotton nightcap. Almost as much nonsense has been written about the Francs-Tireurs in the German papers as about the Uhlans in the French. They were not necessarily savages nor nor any thing of the kind. In the occupied provinces they were simply insurgents, and they led every where the life of insurgents, belonged to the same class or classes of society from which in surgents usually come, and, like insurgents, were adored by their own people and shot as felons if they fell into the hands ofthe enemy. There were, I believe, some bodies of Francs- Tireurs regularly 1 ted in the French army, and they, to the Prussians, were of course like any other French soldiers. Such were \" Les partisans de Gers,\" who had account-books showing that they were in Government service, officers carried < ins, and whose military charai admitted, though their only \"distinctive marks\" were a red sash worn over a black coat and a Calabrian hat.

DELEROT'S WORK. 353 correspondents from all parts of the world, and a grave question \u2014 that of the maintenance of war- sels in the Black Sea \u2014 having arisen between England anel Russia, it was to Versailles that Mr. Odo Russell was sent, on the part of the English Foreign Office, to make representations to Count Bismarck, who had undertaken, in his own language, the part of \"honest broker\" between the Powers at variance. An interesting account of the occupation of Versailles by the Germans was published three years after the conclusion of peace. It would be useful for the future historian, whose possible wants have been so much studied of late years, if the municipal authorities of other French towns which during the war of 1870 fell into the power of the Germans would put together and publish the official documents relating to the occupation, as the authors of this volume have done in ard to the occupation of Versailles. Strictly .king, the authors of the work in question are the Prussians themselves. But the materials, in the form ot requisitions, summonses to appear, condemnations to pay, proclamations, menaces and occasional remissions of punishment, were collected by M. Rameau, Mayor of Versailles, and by him entrusted for publication to M. Delerot, who, considering the hatred he felt and was bound to feel for the conquerors and oppressors of his country, showed commendable moderation in his manner of presenting the paper- Invasion must always be intolerable to the invaded. Xo Brussels conferences or Geneva conventions, however much they may alleviate miseries of the battle-fields, can soften the hard lines of a foreign occupation in its general features ; and M. Delerot would not be more \u2014 he would be something less \u2014 than human were ible to take a perfectly just view of the duct of the Prussians in Prance. The truth is that they behaved badly if we judge them by a high ideal standard ; admirably if we judge them by the standard of what has been done by former invaders engaged in invasions on the same and of the- same momentous character as that of 1X70. all parts of the occupied country, and it would appear that he was quite ready to answer them. Not, however, knowing the authors of the epistles, he was obliged to content himself with writing tor replies on the margin of these curious documents. To one correspondent, who charges him (on the strength of an accusation originally made by M. Jules Favre) with having declared! on entering France, that he made war \" not on the French people, but on the Emperor Napo leon,\" he justly answers, \"Je n'ai jamais dit cela.\" To a correspondent who insults and curses him, and who signs himself \" Un Francais qui ne t'aime pas,\" he quietly remarks, \" II me semble ! \" One writer addresses him, in allusion to the siege of Strasburg, as \" Sire Bom bardeur ! \" Another, after exhausting all the terms of abuse he can think of in the French language, calls him, in plain English, \" old rascal.\" Mention must not be omitted of the part played, in connection with the invasion, by the money-lender attached to the Prussian forces. He was no miserable camp-follower bent on securing much plunder by small advances of ready money, nor private bill-discounter prepared to \" oblige \" officers with loans on notes of hand. He was an officially recognised financial agent, representing a syndicate of foreign bankers, who, to enable the municipalities and the occupied towns to execute the requisitions and pay the contributions imposed on them, offered, with a generosity rare in time of war, to lend the necessary funds in return for promises to pay, secured on the local taxes. The arrival of Herr Betzold was announced in the Moniteur de Versailles, the official journal published by the Germans throughout the occupation ; and a few days afterwards his benevolent project for enabling destitute French municipalities to satisfy the most exorbitant Prussian demands was made known through the columns of the little sheet, which thus found itself transformed for a time into a financial newspaper. A second time attention was called to the advantages to he- derived from the scheme ; but neither the elo- quent articles of the Moniteur de Versailles nor the friendly personal representations of Herr Betzoltl himself had any effect upon the munici- pality. The mayor refused to pledge the future resources of the town, or rather, refused to pledge them to the Prussians. A loan was found in dispensable, but the bonds were offered to and taken by the inhabitants. The interest was fixed at five per cent., principal and interest both to The book in question is too full of matter for one to give an idea of its contents, either by of notes or by a connected series ot extracts.

The list certainly shows that many person- were incarcerated on trivial accusations: among others a servant-girl for having returned a box on the ears to an officer ; someone else for having been found \" in possession of a diary containing insulting ex pressions addressed to the King of Prussia \" ; .1 third for having recognised a Prussian spy ; a fourth for haling \"followed Count Bismarck.\" M. Delerot would, perhaps, have preferred that this last victim of precautionary measure.- should have been allowed to pursue Count Bismarck, who, walking out alone, was sometimes completely mobbed ; so that on one occasion he reproached his pursuers with their ignorance ofthe \"usages of war,\" adding that if some impetuous young officer found himself surrounded in such a manner, he would probably make use of his sword. Thus, if Count Bismarck ended by objecting altogether to followers, he did not do so until they had become a serious nuisance. be paid off within three months of signing the peace. While on the subject of contributions and the means taken to enable the conquered populations to pay them, I may point out \u2014 what some professors of international law are perhaps un aware of \u2014 that the Prussians no longer recognise the right of maritime Powers in time of war to seize merchant vessels belonging to the enemy. The contribution of 1,000,000 francs per occupied department, to which M. Delerot devotes some pages, was ordered by way of reprisal, and as an indemnity for the losses inflicted upon German commerce by French men-of-war. The most serious charge brought by M. Delerot against the Prussians is that at Bougival they attacked and wounded a certain number of the inhabitants, on the ground, and apparently under the distinct impression, that they had been fired at with an air-gun : an instrument which, as M. Delerot assures us, is found only in scientific laboratories. 'Lhe Prussians to whom the outrage in question is attributed were tem porarily retreating in face of a sortie from Paris ; and according to M. Delerot, they simply deluded themselves into a belief that the inhabitants of Bougival had assumed towards them an attitude which, under the circumstances, inhabitants are likely enough to adopt. The arrest of tt man who had \u2022'recognised \" .1 Prussian spy is interesting as an example of an action perfectly innocent, and, indeed, praise worthy in itself, but which of necessity entailed upon its author a period of forced seclusion. A spy recognised, even by one individual, is a spy lost unless the individual who has recognised him be at once removed from public lite. The fact that a formal trial was instituted, anil that it resulted in two of the inhabitants being found guilty and shot, would seem to show that there must have been some sort of evidence against them, though M. Delerot will have it that the Prussians were under a delusion on the subject. It is clear, however, from the facts, adduced as such by M. Delerot himself, that the Prussians wished, not so much to act with severity as to be thought severe. The object, indeed, of most punishments ill civilised warfare is, not to punish offenders retributively and in a spirit of vengeance for what they have done, but to deter other possible offenders from imitating their example. No one imagines that there is anything morally wrong in a civilian's wishing to defend his country. But if troops do not molest the civil population, they consider that they have a right to require in return that civilians shall not molest them. One day, then, when a number of peasants taken in arms were brought to Versailles, the Prussians announced loudly their intention to shoot them. But M. Delerot and his friends observed that, instead of being taken to the place of execution, the peasants were imprisoned. On leaving To a large extent, M. Dele-rot's work, inde pendently of the fact that it is well put together ami contains a mass of valuable and interesting information, is impartial. \" Impartiality ! \" ex claims Victor Hugo in his \" Napoleon le Petit.\" \" Strange virtue stir an historian, which Tacitus never possessed ! \" Thereupon Victor Hugo proceeds to \"dechircr\" his victim \"en style de Juvenal.\" M. Delerot claims to have seen things, and to state them precisely as they took place. But, with the best intentions, such an tittitude would be impossible for a citizen ami official of Versailles writing the moment after the occu pation had come to an end, with the wound constantly and inevitably inflicted on his patriot ism still fresh.

The Municipal Elections of the 26th proved favourable to the projected Communal Government, and, on the 20th, the Commune was formally proclaimed. The Red Republicans, leaders in every revolutionary movement, had, since the dethronement of Napoleon III. and the proclamation of the Republic in September, 1S70, never ceased to attack what they con sidered the conservative character of the Govern ment of National Defence ; and in demanding measures of a more democratic kind, they aimed in particular at decentralisation, municipal in dependence, and the introduction of a federated system made up of self-governing communes. These views were supported in good faith by politicians of the extreme Republican side. But they were adopted also, and spread abroad with many pernicious additions, by political agitators, revolutionists, and adventurers ofthe worst kind. The members of the \" Internationale \" \u2014 a society for the promotion of revolution everywhere, of which but little has lately been heard \u2014 did their best to fan the insurrectionary flame; and soon every form of discontent had its represent atives, and every impossible chimera its suppt irters among the leaders of what was still called the Commune. NO sooner had peace been signed between France and Germany than a desperate con flict took place in the streets of the capital, which led to a two months' war between the regular troops established at Versailles and a mass of federated bat talions of the Na tional Guard in Paris itself. The PRINCE BISMARCK. {From a Photograph by Lotschcr and Peisch. ) Communards are known in England as the \" Communists \" ; and, having after a time adopted certain theories on the subject of labour and the division of property as part of their programme, they are generally looked upon as Communists in the socialistic sense of the word. The Communard movement of 1871 was, above all, a revolutionary attempt to establish absolute municipal self-government in Paris. It recalled, then, from the first the Commune of the great Revolution, when Petion was Mayor of Paris, with Robespierre and Danton among his councillors and officials. The Paris Commune of the first Revolution declared all other authorities suspended. It joined the extreme party known as the Mountain (from occupying the highest benches in the Assembly), the movement which resulted in the fall ofthe moderate, well-intentioned Girondists, and remained faithful to Robespierre throughout the Reign of Terror until the overthrow of the revolutionary tyrant. The very name of Com mune wa- then abolished, and in lieu ofa central municipal power, Paris was divided into twelve distinct municipalities. The vagabondism which gave to the Commune so many adherents had been generated and developed during the siege, and there were numbers of men in Paris, composing the worst portion of the National Guard, who saw in the end of the war the end also of their living at Government expense, and who looked forward with dismay to the return of regular work, the enforcement of creditors' claims, the collection of rents and taxes, and a hundred other incon veniences which they had evaded during the war. On the triumphal entry of the German army into Paris, March 1st, 1871, detachments of the National Guard had, by express stipula tion, though contrary to Bismarck's advice, been allowed to remain under arms for the preserva tion of oitler in the streets, and a considerable quantity of cannon having been entrusted to their care (in order to prevent it- falling into the hands Count Bismarck at Versailles had ri mended the disarming of the National Guard. ell-meant advio irded with suspicion, though, as he had foreseen, the revolutionary -pun oi ih, to,,,- in qui stion soon asserted itself.

It was on this occasion that the National Guard came into collision with the regular troops, who had been instructed to receive the artillery from them. Their de termination not to part with the field-pieces placed beneath their protection was at first attributed to an honourable patriotic feeling. But the National Guard lost no time in seeking ammunition for their artillery, and they took -ion of several magazines. They were attacked by some bodies of regular troops, but succeeded in giving a good account of their opponents, some of whom were induced to join them. A Central Committee of the National Guard was now formed, and inflammatory pro clamations were put forward demanding that the National Guard should have the right to elect its own officers ; that the daily war pay of one franc and a half should be secured to each National Guard until he could obtain work, and that General Aurelle de Paladines should be dis placed in order to make room for a commander of their own choosing. In regard to general politics, they demanded universal suffrage and the formal subjection of all military power to the civil authority of the Paris municipality : Paris commune, that is to say. a small body of regular troops was cut off from the main column by a party of insurgents, and General Clement Thomas, former commander of the National Guard of Paris, was taken prisoner and shot. By mid-day on the 18th, the insurgents were in full possession of Mont martre, and towards evening, the Government troops having been driven from the field, they penetrated into other quarters, and now for the first time established themselves in the Place Vendome. Soon after dark, they occupied the Hotel de Ville without encountering any resist ance. By midnight they had made it their head quarters, the regular troops having meanwhile returned to Versailles. On the morning of the iqth, the federated Guards held every point within their power, and the Central Committee were the rulers of the city. The Government over which M. Thiers presided was already estab lished at Versailles. Nothing could be stranger than the way in which the forts around Paris were now occupied. Those on the eastern and north-eastern side were still in the hands of the Germans. The regular Government held Mont-Valerien, the most im portant < >f all the forts. The other forts had fallen into the power of the federated battalions of the National Guard, who now made preparations for defending the city against a second siege. Elections were at this iuncture made to a municipal assembly ; the Commune was declared to be the only true and legitimate Government of the city ; and a Journal Officiel de la Com mune de Paris was founded, in which a series of decrees was immediately published. The old revolutionary calendar was restored, March 2Qth being announced as \" the eighth of Germinal, year 7Q.\" Laws were issued requiring every able-bodied citizen, from nineteen to forty, to serve in the National Guard ; a partial remission of overdue rents was granted ; three years' time was given for payment in full of overdue notes and bills, and the daily pay of the National Guards was raised to two and a half francs. All articles, moreover, that had been pawned for a sum not exceeding twenty francs were to be returned to their owners ; pensions were to be paid to the widows and orphans of those falling in the insurrection; and all factories whose owners had left Paris were to become the property ofthe workmen employed in them. Ihe chief ot the new National Government, M. Thiers, saw that the time for suppressing the movement in favour ofthe Commune had arrived. 'Lhe National Guard had carried their artillery to the heights of Montmartre, and some ten thousand of the regular troops now took up posi tion- of attack at the base ofthe hill. They then 1 upwards to the summit , i ivercame the guard placed outside the insurgents' camp, took the cannon, and made several hundred prisoners. Having once got possession of the cannon, the regular troops do not seem to have known what to do with their capture. News of the affair spread rapidly through the workmen's quarters ot Montmartre and Belleville, and the alarm having been beaten, several battalions of National Guards mustered and marched to the hill on whose crest the cannon still remained. One of the regiments entrusted with the custody of the guns fraternised with the assailants, and the victory of the National Guards was thus made easy.

The worst fate of all was reserved for Duval's column, which, on approaching Mont-Valerien, irprised at close quarters by a terrible dis charge of artillery from the fort believed to be abandoned. 'Lhe middle part of the column was annihilated, and the leading regiments, equally with the rear, took to flight. Duval himself was captured and shot. of Sedan, he would have had no choice hut to surrender on the terms which his successor in com mand, General de Winipffen, was compelled to ac cept. Nevertheless, while General tie Wimpffen, Marshal Bazaine, and General Ullrich, Com mandant of Strasburg, were stigmatised, with all the commandants of the numerous fortified tow us which surrendered under severe bombard ment, as unworthy of the trust reposed in them, Marshal MacMahon, by the mere accident of his having been incapacitated at the beginning of the most critical battle of the whole war, was regarded as a hero without fear and without reproach. Bergeiet's place in the army was now taken bv a Pole, Ladislas Dombrowski, who was al-o made Commandant of Paris. Another reign of terror seemed at hand. Requisitions were made upon public institutions of various kind-, including churches ; and several rich men, accused of disloyalty to the Commune, had their property seized and confiscated. Numbers of Communist prisoners taken in action had been shot, and it was now declared that in putting to death unarmed soldiers the Versailles authorities had transgressed the rules of civilised warfare. The Archbishop of Paris, Monseigneur Darboy, with other ecclesiastics and civilians of eminence, were seized as hostages ; and it was announced that for every Communist prisoner put to death three hostages would be executed. Monseigneur Darboy was one of the first victims under this decree. Tragic, indeed, has been the fate of three archbishops of Paris in succession : Monseigneur Afire, who perished on the barri cades in the days of June, 1848, as he was seeking to pacify the insurgents ; Monseigneur Sibour, ina ted by a fanatical priest; Monseigneur Darboy, -hot in cold blood by the Communists. 'Lo return to Versailles \u2014 the regular troops occupied point after point, until at last they were prepared for a final advance. Rossel, an artillery officer of considerable talent, had now replaced Cluseret as \" tie-legate for war.\" Dombrowski re tained the chief command. But the Commune was greatly in want of leaders, and numbers of battalions were without chiefs. On the 10th of May M. Thiers' private house was demolished, and on May 1 6th the Vendome column was over thrown. The insurgents, under the pressure of the Versailles troops, became almost as frantic as were the revolutionists of the Reign of Terror when they feared the invasion of all Europe. The most bitter hatred was expressed against the Versailles Government by popular orators har anguing crowds in the streets and in the great republican clubs. Bands of women, as during the revolution of 1780, marched through the public thoroughfares, carrying arms and exciting the people against the \" assassins of Versailles.\" On the 14th of May several forts were captured from the Communists ; and on the 2 1st everything seemed ready for a general attack. Proclamations were posted on the walls of Paris calling upon citizens to fight to the la.-t ; and officers rode through the streets inciting all they met to determined resistance. These appeals proved ineffective in the richer quarter- of Paris, where the arrival of the Ver sailles troops was looked forward to with joy. But they met with the fullest response in the workmen's districts, where even women and children fought at the barricades. Begun on Sunday, May 21st, the operations of the Ver sailles army were continued on Monday and Tuesday. 'Lhe troops had been divided into five columns, which were to form a cordon round the city, and, attacking vigorously at certain points in the circumference, were gradually to concentrate so a- to hem in the insurgents on till sides\u2014 the plan, in short, of the battle of Sedan M. Thiers, who had erected the forts of Paris partly against foreign invasion, partly, it was thought, against a possible insurrection in Paris itself, enjoyed within a few months the opportunity of testing their utility in both characters. As a protection against assault from the outside they bail proved ineffective, though they need not have done so had Paris been approached within a reasonable time by a relieving army strong enough to break through the lines of invest ment. Against the forces of the Commune they were found very serviceable ; and, when the final advance was made from Versailles, the forts played tin important part in covering the attack. The Versailles troops were under the command of Marshal MacMahon, who retained his popu larity with the French by reason of his being, as a matter of fact, the only prominent French leader who had not signed a capitulation or in any way capitulated ; though, had he not been severely wounded on the morning of the battle"], [811, "the Commune.] PARIS DURING THE COMMUNE. 359 applied by Frenchmen to other Frenchmen. On Tuesday morning, May 23rd, the attack was begun. The Versailles troops were successful at all points ; but one of the columns met with a ate resistance on the plateau of Mont martre, which was not taken until after severe fighting. Close to Montmartre the Place Pigalle, where Dombrowski had his headquarters, still held out. It was surrounded by a barricade, which was defended with the utmost energy for two hour-, until the Communist leader sell mortally wounded. Then the resistance did not ; but before night the important stronghold wa- in possession ofthe Versailles troops. continually lighted, either by concealed incen diaries \u2014 of whom many were taken with the implements for their work in their hands \u2014 or by petroleum bombs from the barricades and the districts still in possession of the Communists. During this week of conflagrations there were consumed or partially burned, besides a great number of private houses, the Palais de Justice, the Prefecture of Police, the Palace of the Legion of Honour, the Porte St. Martin Theatre, the Grenier d'Abondance, several churches, many mercantile establishments and minor public build ings : all this, besides the more formidable con flagrations at the Hotel de Ville, the Tuileries and the Louvre.\" There was desperate fighting, too, in the Place Vendome, which was at last taken by tin over whelming assault made at the same time from the Rue de la Paix on the one side and the Rue tie Castiglione on the other. The Place de l'Opera was also the scene of a sanguinary struggle. It was not until Wednesday morning that the Bourse was taken, and the only im portant points left unoccupied were now the Hot, I de Ville and the Chateau d'Eau. During the whole of Wednesday, in spite of the distraction caused by the fires, the troops had steadily continued the man\u0153uvres by which they were gradually closing about the last insurgent strongholds. Around the burning hotel the Com munists contested every step of advance with desperate bravery. It was late on Wednesday night before the building, then in flames in four places, was at last abandoned. On the left bank of the Seine the resistance was still more obstinate, and it was only on Thursday after noon that the Versailles troops succeeded in driving the insurgents from their last strong position on the Buttes-aux-Cailles, after the bloodiest contest since their entry into the city. Still fighting, the Communists fell back to the manufactory of the Gobelins, which they set on fire. Here was their last desperate defence on this side of the river. Prisoners in their hands were forced to man the barricades, and after wards were shot down after freedom had been scoffingly promised them. After a violent struggle the Versailles troops gained possession of the whole district, and with it of the last contested spot on the left bank. Meanwhile the insurgents, gradually falling back, had, in their powerlessness, gratified their rage by the most barbarous means. Organised incendiarism had been resorted to, and fire- nou broke ' mt in every part of Paris. Fires which might possibly have been caused by shells had been noticed on the Tuesday, and now, on Wednesday, the Tuileries was in flames. Soon the Palais Royal, a whole side of the Rue Royale, and then, in an easterly direction, the Hotel de Ville, were found to be burning. A panic spread through the city, among the Versailles troops as well as the people. It was repeated from mouth to mouth that the Communists had sworn to burn all Paris by fire kindled with petroleum ; and a series of arrests ami executions was now begun, which soon amounted to the indiscriminate- slaughter of all who chanced to fall under the slightest suspicion. \" It was only neces- sary,\" says an American writer, Dr. Edward L. Burlingame, \"that a man or woman should be pointed at as pctrolcur or pctrolcusc : they hot down without inquiry or mercy. H - were searched, and those hidden in them were brought into the streets and killed.

New fire- were On the right bank the troops were operating towards the Faubourg St. Antoine, and especially the Place de la Bastille, which was taken on Friday, when the insurgents retired to the cemetery of Pere Lachaise. The quarter of Belleville, inhabited almost exclusively by work men, resisted with the greatest ferocity, and on Friday night it was still unconquered by the Versailles troops, who now formed a semicircle around it. On Saturday, May 27th, there were still barricades to take in the Faubourg du Tt rhple ; and the Communists had yet to be dislodged Irom the cemetery of Pere Lachaise. A fire, too, was kept up by a battery on the Buttes Chaumont. On the evening \"t Saturday,"], [812, ";,o [lies and >ARIS. OLD AND NEW May 27th, General Vinoy took the cemetery by storm. The last defence of the Communists was made at a barricade in the Faubourg du Temple, which, in spite of constant attacks, held out until Sunday at noon. At five o'clock on Sunday afternoon the firing had ceased throughout Versailles now lost its military importam headquarters for the army. But the Assembly continued to sit there, and did not until some time afterwards hold its deliberations within the walls of Paris. \" In five or ten years, as soon as you are Strong 1 MARSHAL MACMAHON. (From a Photograph by Apfcrf, Paris.) enough,\" said Count Bismarck to General de Wimpffen, during the negotiations which fol lowed the- battle and preceded the surrender of Sedan, \" you will attack us again, and we must be prepared for you.\" This prediction, happily, has not been fulfilled.

'Lhe peace which followed the Franco-German War has already endured for twenty-three years. \u2014 indulgence in unauthorised uniforms \u2014 which were condemned collectively as fancy dl costumes dc fantaisie. At the beginning of the First Revolution the same phenomenon had been seen. Paris seemed to have escaped from the murderous grip of its foe only to commit suicide. But the deeds of the Commune, however shock ing, were not altogether without precedent in the history ot France ; and, were it now worth while to seek them, excuses might almost be found for the desperation of those days. 'Lhe women were no less ridiculous than the men, as they preceded or followed the battalii ins in military jackets laden with the most grotesque ornaments. These viragoes were the lineal de scendants of the \" tricoteuses \" of the First Revolution, and of The'roigne tie Mericourt. \" The wife of a colonel walks about with a red cap on her head,\" writes the author of a book on the events of the Reign of Terror, entitled \" Un Tcmoin de la Revolution.\" \"She carries pistols in her belt, and boasts publicly of the number of persons she killed during the massacres of August and September.\" There was apparent novelty in the permission given by the Com mune to tenants not to pay their rent ; but this eminently popular measure had been anticipated by the Council of Udiion in the days of the League. The \"pyromania\" by which the fanatical incendiaries of the Commune may well be said to have been inspired had shown itself before in French history ; so, too, had the panic by which the pyromania of 1871 was naturally followed. In the sixteenth century, on the 23rd of May, 1524, the town of Troves was burnt down; men in disguise had, it was said, excited children to kindle the flames. As soon as the news reached Paris, people lost their heads. Some terrible plot was supposed to have been formed, the object of which was to destroy the whole of Paris. Accordingly, just as happened three centuries and a htilf later under the Commune, the citizens came out to guard their own houses, and began by stopping up the holes opening into their cellars. Under the Commune it was said that slowly burning sulphur matches were thrown into all the cellars, and every woman who was seen carrying tt basket or a milk-can was called a pttroleuse. In 1 - -4 it was forbidden by public proclamation to light the customary bonfires on the feast of St. John ; and during the Commune imprudent for several days to light a lucifer in the streets. If there was nothing new in the excesses of the Commune, neither is there in the accusa tions, often groundless, made against the luxury and immorality of the Parisians. Everything that has been said about the demoralisation of France under the Second Empire had been said about the demoralisation of France under Louis Philippe, not to speak of the 17th and 18th centuries, whose morals and manners are only too abundantly described in a whole series of memoirs. \"The industrial and commercial activity of this epoch, the stimulus it gave to all material appetites, brought about,\" says M. Lavallce in his \"History of Paris,\" \" a competition without limits, the most hideous speculation, a more .shameless, more barefaced love of money than in the time ofthe Regency or of the Directory.\" M. Lavallce, however, is here writing not of the Paris of Napoleon III., but of the Paris of Louis Philippe. During the reign of Louis XIV, an English traveller remarked that no people were more industrious than the Parisians, nor gave less money, because he said they hastened to spend all they earned in food, drink and clothes. The vanity of dress, the love of ornaments, and, above all, of decorations in the official sense of the word, has always tormented the Parisians. The 1 for equality still shows itself in France by 'lie wishing to wear tt gold stripe on his trousers or a feather in his cap. No such brilliant display of fantastic uniforms wa- ever seen as during the Commune. Ihe officers ot Dombrowski's ami Bergeret's staff, bumping on their horses a- they pranced along the boulevards, did credit to the imagination ot tumiers; ami after tie -ion of the Commune, .me of the first orders is-ued by al MacMahon dealt with thi- strange abuse \"The more civilisation is developed,\" says M. Maxime Ducamp,* \" the more reproaches of this kind will be made, and apparently in till sincerity. The discovery of the precious metals, which have gradually become abund ant, has given to the world excessive wealth ; wealth has created wants, and some of these wants have become habitual. Every effort is made to satisfy them.

A man will without murmur ing live on oatmeal and horseflesh when he is constrained to tin so by necessity, but in the ordinary course ot lite he prefers wheaten bread and beef-steak. People are said to have been very virtuous at Sparta. But the Spartans honoured theft : a proof of extreme poverty or of inconceivable idleness.\" by the intelligent and beneficent care of the indigent sick, and, were not Paris a wealthy city, the ameliorations introduced into her hospitals would have been impossible. Without the riches produced by so much solicitude for material interests, could the Prefecture ot the Seme have a-signed ;o, ooo, ooo francs for primary education in Paris ? There have never been fewer assassinations or fewer robberies in Paris than at present. The crimes committed to-day, in the midst ofa popu lation of some two millions, are only one-tenth as numerous as those which darkened the period when France counted no more than boo, ooo inhabitants. Whether the moral charactei ol the public has proportionately improved is another question. Police vigilance and pre ventives of all kinds serve doubtless a- a check. The brilliant gas which has been substituted for flickering oil-lamps, the spacious thorough fares which have replaced obscure lanes and alleys, have contributed enormously to the safety of the citizen. Each year in Paris the police effect thirty or forty thousand arrests \u2014 a fact which proves, not indeed that the metropolis has grown eminently moral, but at least that it is well protected. And it is in proportion as the wealth of the nation increases, that the protective organisation of the city can be maintained in greater perfection. In this sense the luxurious wealth which certain moralists so deeply lament, is an inestimable boon even to the poorest section of the community. This wealth and this luxury which moralists, severe upon other people, condemn with violence, have not been without influence in softening manners, and they have brought about, to take only a hygienic view, a notable prolongation of human lite. In lieu of rookeries in which whole families used to rot, in hovels without sun or air, Paris now possesses broad streets with healthy houses which are flooded with light and oxygen, to say nothing of an abundant water supply. This wealth does not afford immoral pleasures alone. It has trebled the productive power of Parisian workmen by substituting for their black bread of other days a substantial reinvigorating diet.

A COMPREHENSIVE, trustworthy, and well-illustrated Gazetteer of the British Isles is, without doubt, a book of reference which every household should possess. Such a work Messrs. Cassell & Company have arranged to produce. The work will contain an alphabetical description of the Counties (with their geological features and river-systems), Parliamentary Divisions, Baronies, Parishes (with their soil), Townships, Cities, Boroughs (County, Parliamentary, and Municipal), Towns, Seaports, Hamlets, Villages, and small places in the United Kingdom. The physical features, such as Mountains and Hills (with their altitude), Rivers, Waterfalls, Bays, Capes, Lakes, Islands, and Rocks and Shoals (with their Lighthouses, Lightships, and Beacons), will be adequately described. The Antiquities will receive a large share of attention. Prehistoric Remains, Earthworks, Burial Mounds, Castles, and Ecclesiastical Ruins will be treated at considerable length, and the Historic Houses more fully treated than in any other Gazetteer. In addition to this information, the population of the place according to the new Census will be given. The distance from the nearest Railway Station, and from London (for places in Great Britain) or Dublin (for places in Ireland) will be represented.

In Three Parts, price Ib. each, or handsomely bound in One Volume, price 5s. Cassell's Sunshine Series. Part 1 will be published Sept. 25, Part 2 Oct. 12, and Part 3 Oct. 25. The striking success which attended the first issue of European Pictures of the Year has induced the publishers to considerably enlarge the work this year. It will be published in Three Parts, price One Shilling each, instead of in one part at half-a-crown as in 1892. By means of the enlargement, not only will the publishers be able to extend the scope of the work and considerably increase its variety, but they will be in a position to do more justice to each country from which contributions are drawn. The selection will include a representative collection of the best and most interesting pictures of the year of France, Holland and Belgium, Germany, Austria. Russia, Spain, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Whether for diversity and charm of subject, delicacy and faithfulness of reprodu- *;on, or the skill and judgment displayed in the selection, it is con fidently believed that this year's issue of European Pictures will form a worthy Fine Art Companion to Royal Academy Pictures, with which it is uniform. An introduction, consisting of critical and explanatory notes by Mr. M. H. Spielmann, Editor of The Magazine of Art, will be included. Already Published, price Is. each.
