CHAPTER I. introduction After the events of the year 1866 a war with France was con sidered inevitable. A pretext only was wanting ; and the policy that France had pursued for centuries enabled her to find one without difficulty, as soon as she thought a propitious moment had arrived. The Luxemburg question in 1867 furnished such a pretext, but the wisdom and apparent pliability of Prussia led to its peaceful settlement. The \" great nation \" raised an absurd shout of triumph at this bloodless victory, and the official trumpets blazoned forth that France had again asserted her moral preponderance in the affairs of Europe. The Imperial press instanced the peaceful settlement of the Luxemburg question as an illustration of the saying \" ! empire c'est la paix.\" Everything in fact tended to show the existence beyond the Rhine of a feverish desire to prove to \" the first nation of the world \" that she still held the first position, not withstanding Konigsgratz and the unexpected alliance between Northern and Southern Germany, and that the government of the day would leave no stone unturned to strengthen its gradually lessening authority over a people eyer ready to welcome a change. B"], [10, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 2 Since 1867 Bavaria had displayed great activity in military affairs. General liability to service had been introduced and had become law from the ist of January, 1868, and all precautions had been taken, in imitation of the approved Prussian system, to make it possible for the complicated machinery of the army to be trans formed into an efficient and handy force, under the Commander-in Chief, in the shortest space of time. The War Office had been employed unceasingly, for some years, in drawing up rules and regulations for a mobilisation, and with such success that, when the long-expected occurrence took place, no hitch occurred ; and, within a fortnight of the issue of the order to mobilise, 60,000 men were ready to take the field. It is easy to see how much had been accomplished in the way of organization, by noting how difficult it had been in 1859 and 1866 to raise from chaos a far weaker and worse-equipped army, with as many weeks' notice as in this case there were days'. The difficulties were great, greater perhaps than one would imagine, in making this achievement possible in Bavaria. Every thing was new, the regulations and instructions for the mobilisation, such as the Etappe and railway arrangements, &c, and even the conditions on which these were based, so that in case of a hitch there were no former experiences to serve as guides. For these reasons all the preparations required the greater cir cumspection and care. In 1866 the order for the mobilisation was promulgated in the first half of May, and by the end of June, \u2014 i.e. about six weeks afterwards, \u2014 the army was formed up on the northern frontier of the country. But Bavaria soon learnt, to her cost, all that was wanting to make the army fit to take the field. The earliest reserve battalions did not join their divisions till the middle of August, three months after the mobilisation had commenced. In 1870 the whole army was mobilised in a fortnight, including sixteen Landwehr battalions and sixteen reserve battalions, as well as corresponding reserve detachments of Rifles and of the other arms, all being on a complete war footing. The army may justly be proud of this performance, but should bear in mind that it was the energy of the War administration that enabled it to take its place beside the Northern German corps at the right moment in a perfectly efficient and serviceable condition."], [11, "Introduction. 3 The War Office had been busied with the internal economy of the army, the regulations for carrying out the general liability to service, and the arrangements necessary to ensure a rapid mobilisa tion ; while the Quarter-Master-General's department had been employed in working out problems based on the assumption that war with France, sooner or later, was inevitable. This work, under the direction of Major-General Count v. Bothmer, took every possible contingency into consideration, and proved of the greatest service. A Frenchman reading these lines will naturally find in them additional proof that Germany or, as the French have it, Prussia wished for war, and had long been preparing for it ! If a peaceful but strong and courageous man notices a thief sneaking near his house, and tries the locks on his doors, and places a good stick in a handy corner, is it he who seeks a quarrel or the burglarious thief? The defensive and offensive alliance between Bavaria and Prussia made over by treaty the command of the Bavarian army in a foreign war to the King of Prussia, as the General Commanding in Chief of the Confederation. But this did not precisely define their relations. The Bavarian forces were placed in general under the command of Prussia, and yet were empowered in the first instance to watch over Bavarian interests in particular ; because, although Bavaria had made a treaty of alliance with Prussia, she had not entered into an obligation to follow her army. This independence reserved by Bavaria formed an important element in the plan of defence against France. For it naturally made a great difference, whether Bavaria intended to fulfil her treaty of alliance by merely covering Southern Germany with her troops, or whether, confiding in the generalship of Prussia, she intended to hand over her corps unconditionally to join in the general defence of Germany. That the existing treaty would be upheld was a matter of course. Only the French and a certain small party at home wished for or predicted the contrary ; but the magnanimity of the reigning Prince could alone ensure the apparent momentary sacri fice of the special interests of Bavaria, for the good of the general cause of the whole of Germany. The army has to thank this resolution of our Commander-in- B 2"], [12, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 4 Chief\u2014 this realization of a great German idea, without wavering or hesitation \u2014 for the finest page in its history. If the Southern German governments had insisted on the direct defence of their states by their own armies, the whole German forces would have fallen into two groups, carrying out separate schemes on separate theatres of war. The main body of the German forces, based on Koblenz and Mainz, was able, and intended, to pursue an offensive course of defence, owing to its favourable strategical position and its numerical strength, whilst the Southern German army would have had to assume a purely passive attitude of defence, and could only have assumed the offensive in accordance with the movements of the main army. Such a disunion would have rendered it impossible, on military and political grounds, for the Northern German army to have afforded a direct support to the Southern German army. From a military point of view, it would have been an error to weaken the main forces by ever so little, and thus to endanger the certainty of success at the decisive point, for the sake of securing a minor and secondary object. Politically, it was to be expected that, if the Southern Germans had brought about a separation of forces, Prussia would have allowed them to take the consequences, and would have made purely Prussian interests her first considera tion. Without common action, there would not have been common interests, and a defeat might have widened the military gap into a political gulf, which even later victories would have failed to bridge over. The war would have become a mere fight or duel between Prussia and France, capable only of proving the relative value of the armies of those two countries. A small party in the state tried from the commencement to bring this about, and had its efforts been successful, the war would have lost its national character, as far as we, Germans, are concerned. If, however, all the German forces united under one guidance, with one and the same object, that position was clearly the most advantageous, which on the one hand would threaten the flank of the enemy should he debouch into Southern Germany, and on the other hand would enable the Germans to assume the offensive in the most decisive direction, viz., along the shortest route to"], [13, "Introduction. 5 Paris. In making these calculations, Belgian and Swiss territories were considered neutral, and, at the commencement of the war at least, both belligerents respected their neutrality. Speaking in general terms, if the Germans decided to act in this spirit, the most suitable lines for their advance would have been from Trier via Mannheim and along the banks of the Neckar, or vid Mainz across the river Main in the direction of Wiirzburg. The forces on the left bank of the Rhine would have been in an excellent tactical position, between Trier, Kaiserslautern and Landau, in which to await the enemy's attack, while the German corps on the right bank of the Rhine could have assumed the offensive against an army of the enemy's pushing into Southern Germany in the direction of Stuttgart, or at any rate of Ulm, and would also have been acting in the most dangerous direction for the French, viz., directly from north to south. The further the enemy should force his way into Southern Germany the worse would it be for him, if superior German forces pushed him off his line of retreat by the Upper Rhine and pinned him against Switzerland. This indirect defence of Southern Germany would become still more effective, if the united German forces succeeded in concen trating on the left bank of the Rhine, on the short front from Trier to Germersheim. An advance of the enemy across the Upper Rhine, if he should dare to make one in the face of the German army, might at once be replied to by a direct attack on French territory. If the enemy, under these circumstances, abandoned the project of crossing the Rhine, and decided upon making an attack on the left bank of the river, he would find the whole German army united. It is easy to understand, that this latter most advantageous position for the German army had been especially kept in view, and considered in all its details, during the military studies which had been made with a view to an expected war with France. In order to obtain this position, three most important and essential points had to be carefully examined and secured. First, the greatest celerity in mobilisation and its simultaneous termination in the Southern and the Northern German corps. Secondly, the technical regulation of the complicated move- ments by railway, so as to make a hitch impossible."], [14, "The Operations of. the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 6 Thirdly, the timely covering of these movements against a sudden dash of the enemy in force, especially at the points of passage of the Rhine from Maxau upwards, and at the two fortresses of Landau and Germersheim. For the enemy might have attempted such an undertaking, and, specially favoured by his railway communications, might have concentrated his troops, which were nearly fit to take the field, from Paris, Lyons, Chalons, Metz and Strasburg. With regard to the first point, the War Office, as has already been stated, had taken such thorough precautions, that the mobilisation was effected with great speed, and in the same time as that of the Northern German army. The work belonging to the other two points, as far as Bavaria was concerned, was carried out by the Quarter-Master-General, Major-General Count v. Bothmer, and it comprised more espe cially the covering of the Rhenish Palatinate. It is impossible in this work to mention all the details which had to be considered, and difficulties which had to be overcome ; only the chief points or framework, as it were, can be dwelt upon. At the first threatening intimation, the weak garrisons of Zwei brucken and Speyer, two open towns of the Palatinate, had been entrusted with the outpost duty on the frontier. The rayons and special work to be performed had been carefully and accurately defined. The technical details for removing the bridge at Maxau to a place of safety, and eventually making use of it at Germersheim, had been stringently laid down, and the work could be carried out in the shortest space of time on receipt of an order from the Commander-in-Chief. Preparations had been made for barring the roads and the bridle and footpaths through the Bien Forest, with regard to the selection of the most suitable points, the collection of materials, and the requisite force of workmen, and also for interrupting the railway line from Weissenburg to Landau, and its branch to Maxau. Precautions had especially to be taken to ensure a successful opposition to any sudden, though insignificant, attack of the French, by reinforcing with celerity the troops without the for tresses of the Palatinate, which were scarcely sufficient in numbers to perform the outpost duty. For this object the 4th Infantry"], [15, "Introduction. 7 Division had been selected, as lying in the garrisons nearest to the Rhenish Palatinate, and preparations had been made for its trans port by railway to the left bank of the Rhine on the fourth or fifth day of the mobilisation, in the strength it should by that time have attained. The ground between the Lauter and the line from Germersheim to Landau had been carefully reconnoitred, especially with a view to enabling a detachment of about the strength of a division to hold superior forces of the enemy in check for at least two or three days, in which space of time reinforcements from Mainz, Koln, &c, could be brought up to secure Landau. In concert with the civil authorities steps had been taken for the formation of a large transport column of country conveyances, with the double object of providing the Germans with a kind of moving magazine, and of removing the horses and carriages in question from the reach of the enemy. Precautions had also been taken for the timely transfer of the depots and points of formation of the Landwehr divisions belonging to the Palatinate, either within the fortresses or to the Bavarian provinces on the right bank of the Rhine. Whatever preparatory work could be performed in time of peace in the two fortresses of Landau and Germersheim had been carried out hand in hand with these measures of security. Owing to the especial importance of the lines of railway, an exact study had been made of their condition, capabilities, gradients, stations, &c. The probable points of embarkation and debarkation had been reconnoitred, and the necessary works planned in detail. A provisional railway time-table had been drawn up, and the various Etappe railway stations determined on ; at the same time the construction of the platforms, &c, that were deemed neces sary, having regard to the relative importance of the stations as possible points of embarkation or debarkation, had been provided for. The basis of all these studies or preparations was the sup position, which future events proved to be well founded, that France was diligently seeking a pretext for war with Prussia, and therefore with Germany, and that she would eventually discover one, however trivial the circumstances leading to it might be. Less foundation, however, was there for the supposition, which,"], [16, "8 TJie Operations of the r. Bavarian Army Corps. in military circles had become a matter of conviction, that the French would not provoke a war until they were in a perfect state of preparation ; and apparently still less for the further supposition, that the declaration of war would immediately be followed by an offensive stroke against Germany, and especially against the Palatinate, so as to secure a good military position for the French army and a good political position for French diplomacy. The above-mentioned works were completed and regulations framed by the end of 1869; the spring and summer of 1870 came, and no one in Germany expected that the war would break out that year. Events proved otherwise."], [17, "9 CHAPTER II. the mobilisation and movements by railway. {July 17th to August ist.) On the 16th of July His Majesty the King of Bavaria promul gated the order for the mobilisation of the whole army. This order was transmitted by telegraph to the commandant of every garrison and of every Landwehr district. The 17th of July was fixed as the first day of the mobilisation, which was to be effected in strict accordance with the plan laid down for the year 1870, in which detailed instructions were issued for each staff and detachment, for the military train, &c, so that no mistake could possibly take place. The different departments of state also had their orders prepared to place field-chaplains, post-office, railway, and telegraph em ployes at the disposal of the army, so as to enable them to join their respective commands within a few days of the issue of the order for mobilisation. The troops destined to take the field in the first instance were mobilised in their respective garrisons, with the exception of the ist Brigade, the garrison town of which was Munich ; there was a want of accommodation in the capital, and it was not considered conducive to discipline to billet men on the citizens, for which reasons this Brigade commenced its movement by rail on the 19th of July to the hut encampment at Lechfeld. In accordance with the preparations already referred to, the I. Corps was moved to the Haardt mountains, the railway time table having been drawn up for its transportation, and the marches from the point of debarkation laid down. In consequence of orders from superior authority, the assembly of troops about Neustadt on the Haardt was countermanded, and"], [18, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 10 the I. Corps ordered to concentrate in a camp at Germersheim, the II. Corps in a camp at Lussheim. The necessary alterations were made in the time-table, whilst a staff officer and the requisite commissariat employes were sent on the 28th of July to Germersheim, to take measures for providing for the troops in every particular. The order of battle, as well as the detail of garrison troops {see Appendix, No. I.), were issued by the 20th of July, and by the 22nd of July the army was on a war footing. On that day the fortress of Landau was declared in a state of siege ; Germersheim had been declared so by its governor on the 17th of July. By the fifth day of the mobilisation (July 22nd) the marching orders and revised railway time-tables were issued to the various detachments ; by the same day the railway Etappe commands were established, and at their work of superintending the em barkation and debarkation of the troops and their maintenance en route. The War Office issued a notice on the 26th of July, that the V. and VI. Prussian, the I. and 11. Bavarian Corps, together with the troops placed in the field by Wiirtemberg and Baden, constituted the III. Army, under the command of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Prussia. The King of Prussia had assumed the active direction of the army of the Northern German Confederation as early as the 20th of July, through the Chief of the General Staff, General v. Moltke. The direction of the Southern German troops was similarly assumed by His Majesty as Commander-in-Chief of the Confederation. By the 30th of July, each division of the I. Army Corps reported its mobilisation complete. The only exceptions were the Provision Columns, the 2nd and 3rd portions of the General Ammunition Column, and the General Field Hospitals. Most of the troops, in fact, were in a perfect state of mobilisation by the 28th of July, the ist Infantry Regiment as early as the 26th of July. The War Office was amply rewarded for the circumspect and energetic activity which it had displayed since 1866, by this quiet and successful mobilisation of the Bavarian army within a fort night. Not only was the materiel at hand for the field, reserve, and"], [19, "The Mobilisation and Movements by Railway. 11 garrison troops on a complete war footing, but a reserve of ammu nition, equipment, and clothing was secured of the most compre hensive character and equal to the greatest possible demands. The preparations which we have mentioned as having been carried out under the direction of the Quarter-Master-General bore important fruits. It is not part of our task to relate how the regulations were carried out for the security of the Palatinate in the first instance, as the II. Corps furnished those troops, which, aroused from a state of perfect peace, proceeded on outpost duty, and were within a few days prepared to resist the first blow of a confident enemy. All the preparations had been thoroughly con sidered and planned, so that General Count v. Bothmer, who in the first instance was entrusted by the Minister of War with carry ing out the necessary precautions, had but to issue the order for the execution of the plans which he had previously drawn up with the consent of the War Office. Three lines of railway had been decided on for the use of the Bavarian army, and a thorough study had been made of their capabilities, &c, viz : \u2014 Line A \u2014 Ulm, Stuttgart, Miihlacker, Bruchsal. Line B \u2014 Nordlingen, Jagstfeld, Meckesheim. Line C \u2014 Heidingsfeld, Mosbach. The railway lines of the interior of Bavaria were all in connec- tion with one or other of these lines. The transport of troops on Line A, which was chiefly to be used by the I. Corps, could not commence till the 30th of July, because up to that day it was required by the Wiirtemberg troops. The first military transports were despatched on lines B and C, as early as the 28th of July, the twelfth day of mobilisation. The following were the trains told off to move the I. Corps to the Rhine : \u2014 By Line A 65 trains. By Line B 26 trains. By Line C 6 trains. Total 97 trains. The railway trains to convey all columns, train, and reserves of every description, were of course included in this number."], [20, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 12 The trains conveying the whole Bavarian army, with the excep tion of the 4th Infantry Division, which had been sent to the Rhenish Palatinate before the regular movement by railway com menced, were despatched as follows : \u2014 By Line A, between 30th of July and 9th of August, 73 trains. By Line B, between 28th of July and 6th of August, 46 trains. By Line C, between 28th of July and 9th of August, 56 trains. Total 175 trains. There was a considerable difference in the number of trains de spatched each day. More were despatched in the earlier days than later, when it was merely a question of despatching the last portions of the military train. For instance, 12 trains were despatched daily on line A on the 30th and 31st of July and on the 1st of August. On line B, on the first three days respectively, 9, 6, and 12 trains. On line C, 9 trains were despatched on the 28th of July, 8 trains on the 29th, and a like number on the 30th. The northern line through Bavaria by Hof, Bamberg, Wiirzburg, Aschaffenburg, was handed over to Prussia for her exclusive use, in accordance with a previous agreement. The Officer Commanding the I. Corps, General Baron v. d. Tann, left Munich with his staff on the evening of the 31st of July, and proceeded vid Nordlingen and Jagstfeld to Meckesheim, where he arrived on the afternoon of the ist of August."], [21, "13 CHAPTER III. concentration at germersheim. \u2014 crossing the frontier. {August 2nd to $th) The headquarters of the III. Army were established on the 30th of July at Speyer. An order had been issued thence to the commandant of the camp at Germersheim, directing the troops belonging to the I. Corps not to remain in the Germersheim camp, but to go into cantonments about Speyer, those which debarked at Bruchsal proceeding vid Germersheim, those which debarked at Meckesheim vid Lussheim. General v. d. Tann, immediately on his arrival at Meckesheim, had proceeded in company with his Chief of the Staff, Lieutenant-Colonel v. Heinleth, to Germersheim, for the purpose of carrying out an order which he had received from the Commander-in-Chief of the III. Army, to assume command of the troops united at Germer sheim by 10 p.m. In consequence of the new order, he proceeded during the forenoon of the 2nd of August to Speyer. In the course of this day the troops, coming part vid Lussheim and part vid Germersheim, marched into cantonments about Speyer, where the 1st Infantry Division, as well as the 3rd Brigade and a few other detachments of the 2nd Infantry Divi sion, had arrived as early as the evening of the ist of August. On the afternoon of the 2nd of August the headquarters of the III. Army issued their first army order, which gave the following instructions for the next day : \u2014 \u25a0 \"The 4th Bavarian Infantry Division will concentrate near Bergzabern, with its outposts on the line Schweigen-Kapsweyer- Schaidt ; the V. Corps will be collected at Billigheim, the XL Corps at Rohrbach, the latter placing outposts on the line Schaidt-Langenkandel. The 4th Cavalry Division will concen-"], [22, "The Operations of the I.

The Wiirtemberg Divi sion will be on the right bank of the Rhine between Maxau and Knielingen.\" In accordance with the above, the corps orders were issued to the effect that the 1st and 2nd Infantry Divisions were to encamp on the 3rd of August at Germersheim, while the Cuirassier Brigade and Reserve Artillery were to bivouack between Lingen feld and Westheim. The troops which had gone into cantonments about Speyer on the 1st of August were ordered to march to Germersheim late on the afternoon of the 2nd, the remaining detachments to march early on the 3rd.

Bavarian Army Corps. 16 In accordance with these orders, the I. Corps, on the 4th of August, marched in three columns into a bivouack to the west of Langenkandel. This was their first night in the open ; owing to a heavy fall of rain, which had commenced on the previous afternoon, it told severely upon them. The losses, during the first days of the operations, from sickness and fatigue, were in fact disproportionately great. The inevitable disadvantages attending movements by railway now became apparent. Most of the men had only just left their various civil employments, and from a state of profound peace, they found themselves suddenly plunged into the irregular life of war, so trying to both the moral and physical powers ; for there had been no period of transition, during which they might have been gradually inured by a course of drill and military exer cises to the hardships they now had to encounter. In former wars the marches before the actual commencement of operations often lasted for weeks, by which means the weak and sickly were gradually eliminated, and there remained a body of strong and healthy men, equal to any demands. Troops may now be placed on the field of battle within 48 hours of leaving their garrison town, and these necessary eliminations are rendered much more striking by their all taking place at once, than they would be if gradually spread over a considerable space of time. Another inevitable disadvantage attending transporta tion by railway was brought to light at the commencement of this war. A large number of those left behind on account of fatigue or footsoreness recovered after a few days' rest, but there was no pause of any duration in the rapid course of the German opera tions, and therefore these convalescents were unable to rejoin their divisions for a considerable time, and then only after fresh and very great exertions. Another circumstance, which may help to account for the numerous cases of sickness in the early days of the campaign, was the irregular consumption of food and drink during the transport by railway. In future operations this subject would be well worthy of attention. The cordiality and generosity of the inhabi tants at the various stations cannot of course be repressed, but it would in future be to the interest of the troops themselves to impose some restrictions on the receipt of these gifts. The first gun fired in this war was heard in the direction of"], [25, "Concentration at Germersheim. \u2014 Crossing the Frontier. 17 Weissenburg, while the troops were on the march near Langen kandel. The war had commenced ! The iron wheels were in motion, what would they not destroy, and when and where would they end their crushing career ? As the heavy reports of the guns were heard, many a one put these questions to himself. The only answer was : \u2014 \" Let every man do his duty, and all will happen as it should !\" That afternoon a Bavarian staff officer, attached to the head quarters of the army, brought the news of the capture of Weissen burg by the 4th Infantry Division, and of the storming of the Geisberg by the V. Corps. This engagement, however, had not revealed the fact that the Germans were only opposed by an isolated division. It was naturally believed that the main body of MacMahon's army was in the neighbourhood, and that a great battle would be fought on the morrow. The I. Corps received orders, therefore, to push on the same evening through the Bienwald to the Lauter, in order to be at hand on the 5 th of August. The troops were ordered to cook one more meal and then to hold themselves in readiness to march. Meanwhile the course of the engagement at Weissenburg, the hasty retreat of the beaten enemy, and the nonappearance of fresh troops, plainly showed that the main body of the opposing army was not in the imme diate neighbourhood. On this account the projected march of the I. Corps through the Bienwald was not carried out that day, and the Army Corps did not leave its bivouack. The army orders for the 5th of August ordered the continuation of the advance in the direction of Strasburg. The various corps received the follow ing directions : \u2014 The 4th Cavalry Division will seek the enemy in the direction of Hagenau, and will patrol with one regiment from Sulz towards Worth. The II. Corps will move along the Bitsch road as far as Lem bach and bivouack there. The IX. Corps will bivouack to the south of Sulz. The V. Corps will march to Preuschdorf, push outposts on to Reichshofen, and keep up communications with the II. Corps. Werder's Corps (Wiirtemberg and Baden Divisions) will march in the direction of Sulz and bivouack to the west of Aschbach, C"], [26, "18 The Operations of tlie I. Bavarian Army Corps. sending its outposts towards Rittershofen, Haten, and Nieder Rodern. Finally, the I. Corps will march at 5 A.M. vid Altenstadt, and bivouack near Ingolsheim. This Army Corps left its bivouack at Langenkandel at the pre scribed hour. The ist Infantry Division led the advance, followed by the 2nd Infantry Division and the Reserve Artillery. The Cuirassier Brigade had to move through the Bienwald vid Ober seebach to a bivouack east of Ingolsheim. Near Altenstadt the head of the column came upon the Prussian Corps (v. XI.) in the act of marching off. A delay of some hours occurred, but unfortunately, owing to the uncertain duration of the halt, this opportunity of cooking a meal could not be embraced. The block and the unusual heat caused much more fatigue than a rapid continuation of the march would have done. In the afternoon, at last, the columns crossed the French frontier with loud cheers. Owing to the lengthened delay at Weissenburg, and the oppres sive heat of the weather, the troops were late and somewhat exhausted in reaching their bivouack at Ingolsheim.* There was a scarcity of water, which the exertions of the day rendered it doubly hard to endure ; some detachments were, in consequence, unable even to cook their food. Straw, too, was not to be had, and with the evening came torrents of rain, so that the troops were forced to pass the night on the soaking ground without any kind of protection. The unusual heat of the day's march, followed by a wet bivouack, caused considerable losses to some regiments from sickness. The scouts sent out by the Prussian cavalry brought informa tion that Marshal MacMahon was concentrating the main body of his army about Reichshofen. It was decided that the III. Army should remain on the 6th of August very much in its present position, only changing its front towards the direction of the enemy. The II. Corps, at Lembach, was to form the pivot of this wheel, the I. Corps was to \" move to the neighbourhood of Lobsam and Lampertsloch, with its outposts pushed through the Hochwald * The 2nd Infantry Division and the Reserve Artillery did not arrive at the bivouack before n P.M and midnight respectively."], [27, "Concentration at Germersheim. \u2014 Crossing the Frontier. 19 towards the Sauer ;\" the XI. Corps was to wheel to the right and bivouack about Holschloch ; the 4th Cavalry Division was to remain in its bivouack, but to change front to the west. Werder's Corps was to cover the movement against an attack from the south, and with this object was ordered to march to Reimersweiler and send on outposts towards the Hagenau Forest. From these directions, which were issued on the evening of August 5th, it is clear that there was no intention of fighting a battle on the following day, but that the army was to be formed so as to enable it to attack the enemy on August 7th, with the whole of its available strength, if the state of affairs to the south, in the direction of Strasburg, should by that time be thoroughly cleared up. Meanwhile, on the 5th of August, MacMahon had concentrated what troops he could on the heights to the west of Worth. The 1st Division* of the 7th Corps (Douay), which had arrived by railway during the day from Miihlhausen, was at his disposal, and also the four divisions of his own Corps, of which the 2nd had certainly suffered greatly in morale from its defeat at Weissen burg. On the evening of August 5th, MacMahon received news from the Emperor Napoleon that the 5th Corps (Failly) was placed under his orders, and directions were immediately des patched to this Corps to move towards the point of concentration, \" aussitot que possible.\" From a tactical point of view, the French army occupied the ideal of a defensive position ; but it had the disadvantages common to all so-called \" unassailable\" positions. It extended from Elsas hausen by Froschweiler towards Neuweiler. Along its front, through some swampy meadows, ran a stream called the Sauer bach, with a depth in some places of four feet. From this stream there was a somewhat steep ascent to the. ridge of heights which formed the actual position. This ridge was almost bare, but its summit was planted with vines and hops, from under cover of which the defenders, posted on the crest, could pour down a grazing and unerring fire on any assailant who should attempt to storm the heights. Besides this, the heights on which the French had taken up a position commanded those on the left bank of the Sauer bach, and falling gently to the rear (west) towards Reichshofen, * This Division, however, brought no artillery with it. C 2"], [28, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 20 afforded this further advantage, that all movements of troops in rear of the advanced firing line could be concealed from the Ger man troops, posted beyond the Sauerbach, on its left bank. This position, imposing as it was, more especially at first sight, had some very vulnerable points, which were quickly discovered by the headquarter staff of the army. First, the enemy's position was deficient in issues to the front, an attack upon it might in the worst case be repulsed, but a counter attack to the front was hardly to be feared, for, should the' enemy attempt it, he would reverse the state of affairs and all the advantages of his position, such as the open slope, the deep Sauer bach, &c, would become so many disadvantages. Secondly, the enemy's flanks were not supported. His right flank was more or less in the air, his left rested on that most doubtful of all points of support to wings \u2014 a wood. The great strength of this front, overgreat if we may so call it, admitting as it did of no forward stroke, suggested to the German leader a plan involving little risk ; it consisted in keeping a mere hold on the enemy in front, at the same time turning and attack ing both his flanks. Speaking generally, this plan was executed on the afternoon of the 6th of August as follows : the movement against the enemy's right flank was made by three divisions (xi. Corps and Wiirtem berg Division), that against his left by two divisions* (one from each Bavarian Corps), while only two divisions (v. Corps) kept a firm hold, to commence with, on his somewhat extended front, and, as soon as the turning movements were developed, joined the other divisions in a vigorous attack. In the evening, at Ingolsheim, the disposition of the troops of the I. Corps had been arranged for the following day, whereby such precautions were taken as are necessary when near an enemy but not such as when an immediate and important collision is expected. At 6 A.M. the 2nd Brigade was to leave its bivouack at Ingol sheim, and, having the 3rd Light Cavalry Regiment attached to it, was to march as the advance guard by Keffenach, Memelshoffen and Lobsam to Lampertsloch. From this point outposts were to push along the banks of the Sauerbach between Mattstall and \u00bb If the engagement had lasted longer, the two other divisions of the 1. and n.

The remainder of the ist Infantry Division and the whole of the 2nd were to follow at 7 and 8 A.M. respectively, and take up bivouacks between Lobsam and Memels hoffen, while the Reserve Artillery and the Cuirassier Brigade were to remain at Ingolsheim. At 8 A.M., August 6th, just as the Officer Commanding the Corps was about to leave Ingolsheim, a report came in from the advance guard that the roar of cannon was audible in the west. General v. d. Tann, at the head of the 2nd Infantry Division, rode off towards Lobsam, after having issued orders to the Reserve Artillery and Cuirassier Brigade to move their bivouacks to the right (west) side of the high road, so that in case their departure should be accelerated, they might not be detained in the village street of Ingolsheim, which was blocked with carriages of every description. At that moment, 8.30 A.M., the guns were no longer heard."], [30, "22 CHAPTER IV. BATTLE OF WORTH {August 6th) ON reaching the heights near Memelshoffen, the advance guard (2nd Brigade) heard the report of cannon. Major-General Orff at once sent in the report already mentioned, and ordered the whole of the 2nd Brigade to concentrate on the advanced party, which had reached Lampertsloch. This Brigade was commanded by Major-General Orff, and con sisted of the following troops : \u2014 4th Battalion Rifles (Major Reschreitter). 2nd Regt. ( ist Battalion (Major Sauer). (Colonel -j 2nd \u201e (Major Mehn). v. d. Tann) v. 3rd \u201e (Major Steurer). nth Regt. f ist Battalion (Major Baumen). (Colonel Leublfing) ( 2nd \u201e (Major Bohe). Grundherr's Battery of 4-pounders. Total strength about 5,000. The rain that had fallen during the night had softened and spoiled the roads, rendering the advance very difficult and fatiguing. A narrow lane of the worst description, a mere communication between two hamlets, was the only road at the disposal of the Army Corps, which was therefore forced to move by files. The clayey soil was soon saturated by the rain, and the troops, wading rather than marching through the mud, made their way but slowly and with great exertion."], [31, "Battle of Worth. 23 Wagons and guns could hardly advance even at a walk, and it was impossible, owing to the clayey nature of the soil, to attempt to leave the road and march across the fields. Not only was the road thoroughly bad, but it made several windings up and down hill across the spurs of the ridge, and thus offered further obstacles to an acceleration of the march. Soon after 10 A.M. the 2nd Brigade had completed its con centration at Germersheim ; the firing in the direction of Frosch weiler became heavier, but the formation of the ground did not admit of a view of the general state of affairs. It was, however, evident that the enemy was in position on the heights near Froschweiler, and that the Prussians were carrying on a lively engagement. The Officer Commanding the ist Infantry Division, Lieutenant- General v. Stephan, had reached the 2nd Brigade, and determined, on his own responsibility, without waiting for further orders or directions, to move with all his forces towards the field of battle, and as soon as he could bring up his ist Brigade, to attack the enemy's left wing with the whole of his Division. Major-General Orff, meanwhile, led his Brigade to the top of the heights south of Gorsdorf; Grundherr's Battery of 4-pounders took up a rather more advanced position on the spur between Worth and Gorsdorf, which slopes down towards the Sauerbach, and opened fire on the opposite heights. The other three batteries of the ist Infantry Division also took up positions as they arrived on the right of the artillery of the V. Corps. The 1st Brigade, after concentrating its column at Lobsam, (for it had been too much extended, owing to the badness of the road,) had, without orders, commenced its march in the direction of the firing, when it received instructions to move up to the 2nd Brigade as rapidly as possible. The ist Brigade (Major-General Dietl) and the remainder of the ist Infantry Division consisted of the following troops : \u2014 2nd Battalion Rifles (Major Vallade). Body Guards, ( ist Battalion (Major Eckart). (Colonel -J 2nd \u201e (Major Bauer). Tauffenbach) I 3rd \u201e (Major Joner). ist Regt, f ist Battalion (Major Luneschloss).

Stephan purposed marching, as soon as his Division should be united, against the left flank of the enemy's position. He at once issued orders for the 2nd Infantry Division to accelerate its march, and for the Reserve Artillery and Cuirassier Brigade to move up as quickly as possible, and then hurried on to the battle-field. At 12.45 P-M- ne arrived on the heights to the south of Gorsdorf, where he found the 2nd Brigade. At this time the fighting was raging chiefly on the enemy's right wing, near Elsashausen. Masses of smoke, distinguished by their darker colour from the smoke of powder, showed that the place was on fire ; at this moment, too, flames arose from the church of Froschweiler, which lay exactly opposite. The Prussian skirmishers had established themselves on the slope which rises from Worth towards Froschweiler, and were exchanging a lively fire with the enemy's detachments posted in the vineyards and hop-gardens nearest to Froschweiler. The batteries of the V. Corps and those of the 1st Infantry Division kept up a fire on Froschweiler and its neighbourhood, and at this time were vigorously replied to by the French batteries. It was comparatively quiet on the enemy's left. Nothing was heard there but a feeble musketry fire in the direction of Langensulzbach. Of the II. Corps no news had reached the I. Corps, which was still unaware that the former had already, by the brave advance of the 4th Infantry Division between 9 and 11 A.M., rudely shaken the enemy's left wing (ist Div., Ducrot), and compelled it to assume a position en potencc, front ing to the north. The enemy's left flank, as has been already mentioned, rested on a wood which extended from Froschweiler down to a small stream called the Sulzbach."], [33, "Battle of Worth. 25 This stream flows in a south-easterly direction from Langensulz bach along the base of the wooded heights on which Froschweiler lies, and falls into the Sauerbach near Worth. These heights are advanced like a natural bastion, to which the Sulzbach forms as it were a second ditch. A wooded spur runs direct from north to south between the Sulzbach and the Sauerbach, of which the latter stream is both broader and deeper than the former. This spur formed the starting point from which the ist Infantry Division, later in the day, made its attack on the heights of Froschweiler. General v. d. Tann rode up to the Officer Commanding the V. Corps, Lieutenant-General v. Kirchbach, who was directing his troops in their laborious and sanguinary work from the heights to the east of Worth. From this point the progress of the XL Corps, which continued to gain ground towards Elsashausen, was perceptible. While General v. d. Tann was still with the Officer Commanding the V. Corps, an order from the Officer Commanding the army arrived for a general advance to be made at once. To the 2nd Infantry Division an officer was again despatched, with the pressing request to accelerate its arrival to the utmost, and Major-General Orff was directed to advance. The latter was already (2 p.m.) about to lead his brigade down the heights towards the Sauerbach. The remarkable strength of the front of the enemy's position in itself forbade a direct front attack, but also secured us from the possibility of a counterstroke from that direction. The 2nd Brigade moved somewhat to its right (northwards), in order to cross the Sauerbach by three temporary wooden bridges, which the pioneers were to throw across at a point to a certain extent covered from the enemy's fire. Some of the troops waded across, where the stream was not too deep. The 2nd Brigade was then to push forward, by Alte Miihle and MiAhlacker, towards Froschweiler. On passing the stream this brigade was formed somewhat as follows : \u2014 On the extreme right were the 4th Batn. Rifles and ist Batn. 2nd Regt., both of which, to complete the turning of the enemy's left flank, had to cross the wooded spur between the Sauerbach and the Sulzbach, which has already been mentioned. On the left of these the main body of the Brigade crossed the stream, with the 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt. and ist Batn."], [34, "The Operations of t/ie i. Bavarian Army Corps. 26 nth Regt. in first line, and with the 3rd Batn. 2nd Regt., and 2nd Batn. nth Regt. in second line. Some time was necessarily occupied in constructing and crossing the bridges. It was about 3 p.m. when the last-mentioned bat talions, which were at first in line formation, reached the Sulzbach, flowing as it does at the foot of the Froschweiler heights, and not till then did the actual attack of these heights begin. In accordance with the order of the Crown Prince to engage the enemy on his left flank, General v. d. Tann desired the Officer Com manding the ist Infantry Division to attack with all his troops, and gave Major-General Orff special directions to extend sufficiently to turn the enemy's left wing. Two battalions of the 4th Posen Infantry Regiment (No. 59) had covered the right flank of the v. Corps until the arrival of the ist Infantry Division, but as soon as the general attack began, they placed themselves at the disposal of General v. d. Tann, and fought for the rest of the day in company with that division. It was not of course intended that Lieutenant-General v. Stephan should lead his troops to storm the heights, until the turning move ment had commenced. On this account, and owing to the diffi culties of ground to be overcome, there was a delay of about an hour between the issue of the Crown Prince's order (2 p.m.) and the actual commencement of the attack. Meanwhile the ist Brigade, which had arrived at the mill (Alte Miihle) soon after 2 p.m., had been formed for the attack, and Lieutenant-General v. Stephan took command of the whole of his Division. The ist Brigade availed itself in its march of the cover of the spur, across which, as has already been mentioned, the 4th Batn. Rifles and ist Batn. 2nd Regt. had preceded it. Soon after 3 p.m. began a fierce and obstinate struggle for the possession of the heights of Froschweiler. It is impossible to describe the fluctuations of the confused en gagement in the forest in detail. Only the general positions of the troops, which soon lost all tactical union with each other owing to the nature of the conflict, can be given. On the extreme right, where Major-General Orff had undertaken the direction of the decisive turning movement, there slowly pressed forward towards Froschweiler the 4th Batn. Rifles, ist Batn. 2nd Regt., a few companies of the 2nd Batn. Rifles, and"], [35, "Battle of Worth. 27 some detachments of the 8th Brigade (3rd Batn. nth Regt.), which had been sent to the front again from Langensulzbach. On the immediate left of these were the remaining battalions of the 2nd Brigade, among which the three battalions Body Guards and the Prussian battalions had thrust themselves ; at this point also one battalion of the 7th Brigade (ist Batn. 5th Regt.) * took a leading part in the fight The whole of the wooded mount, on which Froschweiler, the object of the attack, is situated, was encircled on the north and east by these troops ; they had climbed about half way up the slope, but could not succeed in reaching the crest and establishing themselves there, until the battalions of the right wing made the enemy feel the effects of the turning movement. All regular direction of the fight soon disappeared. One after another the detachments were thrust forward at different points, according as the momentary state of the fight required an advance. All these battalions and companies, mingled as they were with one another, were united in one common aim, that of reaching the edge of the plateau. The enemy, however, opposed these exertions with admirable obstinacy ; his undoubted devotion and bravery were assisted by the excellence of his firearm and by the mitrailleuse, which on such occasions is of the greatest service. The French had their best troops at this point \u2014 Zouaves, Turcos, and Chasseurs. The trial undergone by the Bavarian troops in this hotly contested engagement was therefore a searching one, amounting to a trial of personal bravery, of which the troops afforded a brilliant proof. Again and again single detachments, with their officers always in front, stormed up the last rise of the heights, but their attempts were isolated, and failed under the fearful rapidity of the French fire. Lieutenant-General v. Stephan in person led his men to the front, and by his example reassured the wavering, and encouraged the confident to fresh advances. * The ist and 2nd Batns. 5th Regt. had been sent out in the morning with one squadron from Mattstall in the direction of Gorsdorf, to endeavour to establish communications with the v. Corps and to cover the left flank of the 4th Infantry Division, which was advancing to the attack from Langensulzbach. Between 9 and 11 a.m. this Division had gained considerable advantages against the enemy's left wing. It was then recalled to Langensulzbach by an order, which had probably been issued some time previously under different circumstances and been delayed in delivery. Vide Heilmann, Operations of II. Bavarian Corps, &c."], [36, "28 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. The generals, assisted by their staff officers and the superior officers of the troops engaged, exerted themselves especially in inducing the isolated parts of the various battalions to join in a common and concerted attempt to storm the crest, which was still most stubbornly defended.* There were a few critical moments during which the enemy increased his fire to the utmost, and attempted short attacks to his front, but these attempts were soon overcome, thanks to the devotion of the officers of every rank. Heavy losses were suffered in a very short time by several of our detachments, as they pressed forward over ground swept by especially heavy fire of the enemy's infantry and mitrailleuses, or in the continued attempts which they made, with exceptional bravery, to gain the heights. Thus the 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt. lost 10 officers and 192 men,f the ist Batn. nth Regt. 5 officers and 119 men. During the fight in the woods of the Froschweiler heights, in which the firing was obstinately kept up at very short ranges, especially by the Turcos, Major-General Orff gradually pushed forward with the battalions of the right wing in the direction where they were most likely to produce a decisive issue to the engagement. In addition to the 4th Batn. Rifles, and ist Batn. 2nd Regt., which were extended somewhat further to the right (west), Major- General Orff directed two companies of the 2nd Batn.

The inevitable, or rather necessary, intermingling of companies and battalions had too much of the character of disorder; there was a certain want of concert in the exertions of the various small detachments. In the course of the war, the troops became accustomed to this apparent disorder at certain periods of the fight, and it often happened that portions of different detachments were united and led forward by energetic leaders without much difficulty to the attainment of some common object. This should serve as a fresh indication of the necessity, in peace man\u0153uvres, of practising the abandonment of tactical formations, which is often necessitated, as on this occasion, by the character of the engagement, so that men and their leaders may alike become accustomed to disorder, and thus diminish its ill-effects by regarding it merely as what it is \u2014 a necessary evil. j Half the officers and one-quarter of the men."], [37, "Battle of Worth. 29 ments (Colonel Tauffenbach and Colonel Roth), pressed on towards the heights in steady formation. The neighbouring detachments, encouraged by Lieutenant-General v. Stephan, joined these bat talions, and their ringing cheers gave the signal to the remaining troops to make a last and decisive attempt. Froschweiler was at last stormed.* The Prussians pushed into the burning village, from the east and the north, simultaneously with the Bavarians. The stubborn resistance of the enemy was suddenly changed into a disorderly flight. Since 1 p.m. his right flank had been pressed and his retreat threatened by the XL Corps. At Froschweiler, with parts of his ist and 3rd Divisions, he had resisted the united attack of the Bavarians and Prussians, without hope of improving his unfavour able situation, even by a success. At this .point he was fighting for the very existence' of MacMahon's army, and when at 4.30 p.m. the village was seized by the ist Infantry Division in conjunction with the Prussian battalions and a few detachments of the 11. Corps, the retreat which he had begun degenerated into a headlong flight. When the 2nd Brigade began to cross the Sauerbach, the 3rd Lt. Cavalry Regiment rode into the valley and moved by Alte Miihle to Miihl Acker, where it awaited the result of the action in the woods about Froschweiler ; as soon as the Infantry had taken the heights, it received orders to pursue the beaten enemy. Two squadrons (ist and 2nd) took the direction of Reichshofen, while the 3rd Squadron (Captain Nagel) advanced towards Niederbronn, where it captured two guns. The 4th Squadron had extended more to the right, and, in conjunction with the 3rd Infantry Division, had followed the retreating enemy, comino- Up with some troops belonging to one of the divisions of the 5 th French Corps. General v. d. Tann reached Froschweiler just as the Prussian and Bavarian columns had pushed in from three sides. Owing to the arrival at this point of several columns from different direc tions a block occurred, and companies and battalions became so crowded together that there was great difficulty in extricating any complete body of troops in solid formation for purposes of pursuit. * The ist Battalion 5th Regiment joined in this attack."], [38, "The Operations of tlie i. Bavarian Army Corps. 30 The ist Infantry Division had been marching since 6 A.M. on wretched unmetalled roads, and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. had taken part in the engagement. During two hours it had been fighting for the possession of the steep and wooded heights of Froschweiler, and, in consequence of these exertions during well nigh twelve hours, it was now unequal to an effective pursuit. The 2nd Infantry Division, meanwhile, had pursued its weari some march, but in spite of its utmost exertions was unable to reach the field of battle before the day was decided. The repeated orders to this Division to hurry on were not requisite. The roar of the guns and the lively musketry fire induced the detachments to accelerate their march to the utmost, and when the head of the column reached the neighbourhood of Gorsdorf at 5 p.m., directions were given to the leading battalions to take off their knapsacks and to push on towards Froschweiler as speedily as possible. It was then found, however, that the column was so extended, owing to the narrow and bad road, that considerable time was required to concentrate the 4th Brigade, which was leading. When these troops at last reached Froschweiler in the evening, they were not less exhausted than the ist Infantry Division, nor was there much prospect of their being able to carry out a lasting pursuit, which might possibly develope itself into a night engage ment. The 4th Brigade* was therefore ordered, as soon as it began to grow dark, to return, to resume its knapsacks, and to occupy a bivouack between Preuschdorf and Gorsdorf, into which the remainder of the 2nd Infantry Division completed its movement by 1 A.M. In addition to the 3rd Lt. Cavalry Regiment, some battalions of the H. Corps had pursued the enemy as far as Niederbronn and Reichshofen, out of which they had driven him. The ground about Froschweiler and on the road to Reichshofen presented an indescribable appearance, indicating the disorderly nature of the flight of the defeated army. Tents, arms, knapsacks, wagons of every description, were strewn about in wild confusion. On the road to Reichshofen stood a long row of wagons belonging to the \" Intendance,\" which had driven almost within range of the French position at Froschweiler. So * Baumiiller's 4-pounder Battery alone was sent on by General v. d. Tann to support the pursuit."], [39, "Battle of Worth. 31 certain did the victory appear, that even the men of the \" In tendance \" wished to have a near view of the expected \"gloire \" to be achieved by MacMahon's army. The enemy had certainly abandoned his long columns of vehicles, which now underwent a thorough examination at the hands of our soldiers.* On the other hand, the actual field of battle afforded a speaking but bloody proof of the bravery and self-sacrifice with which both sides had fought. A soldier, who saw the heaps of dead and the hundreds of wounded, some groaning, some lying silent and resigned, some again endeavouring to drag themselves away, could not but recognise the bravery of the enemy, even in face of the perfect dissolution of his army. Such has always been the character of the French people and of every French soldier. From the fiery \" en avant ! \" to the screeching \" sauve qui pent ! \" they pass with one bound,\u2014 but each cry is acted upon with equal vivacity. General v. d. Tann in person rode on to Reichshofen to urge the pursuit to the utmost, and did not return till midnight to Froschweiler, where he took up his quarters. The ist Infantry Division bivouacked near Froschweiler. Of the 2nd Infantry Division the 4th Brigade had taken up a bivouack near Gorsdorf, the 3rd Brigade near Lampertsloch. The Reserve Artillery had received an order at 2 p.m. to move forward to Lampertsloch as quickly as possible. The columns which had preceded it had so cut up the road that the artillery could not advance faster than at a walk, and even to keep up this pace the gunners had occasionally to lend the drivers a hand. Late in the evening the column reached Preuschdorf, near which place it bivouacked. The Cuirassier Brigade had received similar orders, but had been delayed by the same difficulties of the road, and did not reach the bivouack at Lampertsloch till darkness came on. At 2 A.M., August 7th, the Cuirassier Brigade received orders to pursue the enemy, but it was detained at the bridge of Worth, which had not as yet been made thoroughly practicable, and was further delayed owing to the place itself being blocked with con- * On this occasion, the numerous lists, books, forms, ftc, showed that the French Intendance executed a considerable amount of writing in the field.

The Brigade joined the 4th Cavalry Division in the pursuit, which it continued as far as Steinburg ; after twenty-one hours in the saddle, it moved into a bivouack near Buchsweiler at midnight, August 7th. The losses of the I. Corps, i.e., of the ist Infantry Division, which alone had been engaged, were by no means unimportant, considering the short duration of the action, viz., from 2.30 P.M. to 4.30 p.m. They were as follows Killed . . . .10 officers, 67 men. Wounded . . . . 27 \u201e 497 \u201e Missing . . . . \u2014 \u201e 152 \u201e 37 officers, 716 men. There were taken from the enemy, 1 eagle of the 36th Regiment of the line, 3 guns, 3 mitrailleuse-limbers, 81 military wagons, and about 800 prisoners. Great were the sacrifices necessary to achieve so great a victory, owing to the enemy's exceeding strength of position, his excellent firearm, and the signal bravery with which he maintained his defence. The Prussian troops exhibited, in the highest possible degree, their devotion and what may be termed their disciplined contempt of death. This brilliant example of stubborn resistance and self-sacrifice gave a powerful impulse to our 1st Infantry Division, not to let themselves be outdone by their comrades in arms, but to complete the appointed task at all costs."], [41, "33 CHAPTER V. THE MARCH TOWARDS CHALONS. {August 8th to 2$th) WORTH had been fought and the first great victory achieved on French soil ! Endless was the rejoicing with which the brave soldiers from every German district congratulated each other on the bloody and hardly won field of battle. The North German from the north and east provinces of Prussia, the faithful and hardy Suabian, the Bavarian from the Alps, \u2014 all had united in the conflict and the victory. The battle of Worth had no less impor tant results in fostering the feeling of unity between all German races, than in the strategical and tactical advantages which were thereby reaped. After the 6th of August, it was felt throughout the III. Army, composed as it was of representatives of every German race, that all could implicitly rely on each other. Let the colour of the uniform be dark blue or light blue, every man felt that he belonged to one and tlie same German army, and as the French inhabitants, in their geographical naivete', refused to know anything of the \" A llemands,\" no one objected to the collective name of \"Prussiens.\" We may congratulate ourselves, considering the critical circum stances, that at least half the Army Corps, led by Lieutenant- General v. Stephan, arrived in time to take a part, we may even without exaggeration say a decisive part, in the battle and to join actively in the pursuit. On the 8th of August began the advance through the Vosges mountains. What manifold considerations and combinations had not arisen from the problem \" of crossing the Vosges in a war of the Germans against the French ! \" Even now, after the total defeat of one of D"], [42, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 34 the best French armies at the foot of these mountains, the dark and sombre woods looked as if they were threatening us with some hidden danger. The I. Corps was directed to cross the Vosges by the valley of Zinsweiler ; on the right (north) marched the II. Corps, on the left (south) the Wiirtemberg Division. The advance guard (4th Brigade), on entering the valley, was almost too conscientious in carrying out its duty of searching the ground bordering on the march, in consequence of which the main body of the 2nd Infantry Division soon came up with the advance guard, and the column came to a halt. The Chief of the Staff of the Army Corps, Lieutenant-Colonel v. Heinleth, hurried to the front, and advanced at a rapid trot with a few light horsemen as far as Barenthal, where the Corps was to finish its march for the day. The column followed, with merely a few subdivisions of skirmishers across the Zinsweiler stream marching in a parallel direction. Nothing was seen of the enemy. A few frightened inha bitants of mills or solitary farms, shyly watched the endless march of the column winding its way through their quiet valley, but no \"chasseur des Vosges \" attempted to defend his native soil. In its first trial, this institution, so much talked of and inaugurated with so much boasting, entirely failed. To be candid, this fiasco of the national defence on the frontier was a most agreeable surprise to us, for it is always a dangerous position for a large body of troops, composed of all arms, to be placed in a mountain defile two days' march in length. An attack, or even a vigorous resistance on the part of the enemy, would have been still more troublesome on the second day than on the first, partly because a considerable number of carriages (for instance, the whole Reserve Artillery) had entered the defile, partly because the configuration of the ground was very much in favour of an enemy in the least enterprising. The thickly wooded spurs of the mountains, which grew higher and steeper as we pro ceeded, sometimes advanced immediately on to the narrow road ; an overturned carriage might have halted the whole column, and there were very few places at which it was possible to make a detour or to turn back. Had it been necessary to overcome any real resistance, the Infantry would have had to exert itself greatly to climb the heights on the right and left, while the other two arms would have been rather an impediment than a support."], [43, "The March towards Chalons. 35 By the afternoon of the 9th of August the Vosges had been safely traversed. The I. Corps bivouacked near Enchenberg, the II. Corps near Lemberg. Communications were opened with the II. Army at Rahling, near which place lay the IV. Corps. At the headquarters of the I. Corps there was no news of the enemy. The victory of Forbach was known, but nothing of the further movements of the hostile corps. On this account, and because the near approach of the II. Army had not been ex pected on the morning of August 9th, the Corps had been dis posed so as to cover the issue from the mountains against an attack from the direction of Rohrbach and Bitsch. With this object the advance guard, 4th Brigade, had been pushed on in the former direction, while the 3rd Brigade had been despatched towards Bitsch. These precautions were, however, soon suspended, as the advance of the II. and IV. Corps rendered a covering party unnecessary. The army orders by the King of Prussia directed that the whole of the III. Army should be concentrated on the Saar on the 1 2th of August. A slight change was made in the prescribed marches (on the nth), because the 11. Army reached somewhat further to the south than had been expected, its left wing (IV. Corps) remaining on the nth of August in Saar-Union, in consequence of which some Corps of the III. Army had to be pushed somewhat further southwards. The I. Corps bivouacked on the 9th near Enchenberg, on the 10th near Diemeringen, on the nth (after a tiring march with many delays, caused by changes in the orders) in the neighbour hood of Drulingen. On the evening of the 12th of August it was posted in Berthelming and Gosselming, with the advance guards on the Saar. On this day the corps of the III. Army were concentrated on the Saar on a front of not more than one day's march in extent. On the right, near Fenetrange, stood the 11. Corps, which had pushed an advance guard forward on the high road to Nancy, and kept up communications with the IV. Corps, lying about Saar- Union. Between Romelfing and Gosselming stood the head of the I. Corps, with the remainder of its troops in very confined cantonments, extending eastwards as far as Werkersweiler ; to the south of the I. Corps, near Lixheim, lay the V. Corps with an advance guard in Langatte. Between the I. and V. Corps was D 2"], [44, "36 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. the Wiirtemberg Division about Rauhweiler ; on the left wing of the army, near Saarburg, stood the XI. Corps, with an advance guard in Heming. East of the XL the VI. Corps, with the ex ception of Hofmann's Division, which had advanced in rear of the right wing of the army as far as Diemeringen. Pfalzburg was lightly invested by detachments of the VI. Corps. Four days after the passage of the Vosges commenced, five and a half corps, or if necessary, by calling up the IV. Corps, six and a half corps, i.e., about 150,000 to 180,000 men, were prepared to crush any fresh resistance on the part of the enemy. Nowhere, however, were the enemy's troops to be met with ; it was only by information extracted from the inhabitants, that the disorder in which the beaten enemy had retreated was learnt. The III. Army had only halted during the 7th of August at Worth and Froschweiler, and on that day the enemy, who retreated towards the south, had been pursued as far as Steinburg by the 4th Cavalry Division, and the Cuirassier Brigade belonging to the I. Corps. The nature of the ground did not admit of cavalry reaping the fruits of the victory, and notwithstanding the rapidity with which the III. Army marched on the following days, the enemy had obtained such a start in his hasty retreat, that we had entirely lost his track. It may be of interest here to mention how the retreat was carried out by the 1st French Corps, which had been beaten at Worth, and by the 5 th French Corps, which had been compromised by this defeat. MacMahon's Corps arrived at Saverne August 7th, the morning after the battle. Early the following morning, after another night-march, it reached Saarburg, on the 9th Blamont, on the ioth Luneville, on the nthBayon, and on the 12th, the day on which the III. Army was concentrated on the Saar, it reached Haroue, on the left bank of the Moselle. On the 14th of August at last the ist French Corps, thoroughly routed and demoralized by the defeats it had suffered at Weissenburg and Worth, and by a succession of forced marches in bad weather with deficient nourishment, reached Neufchateau, whence it was transported further westwards by railway. The 5th French Corps did not carry out MacMahon's order to reach Reichshofen \" aussitot que possible\" which it might have done by marching on the evening before the battle of Worth. On the evening of the 6th of August, however, when the defeat of the"], [45, "The March towards Chalons. 37 ist Corps was confirmed, the 5th Corps no longer shunned a night march, but began without delay a hurried retreat in a southerly direction, leaving one brigade in Saargmtind, without however coming in contact with the Germans. It may be asked why Failly chose this direction in particular. He had known since 9 p.m., August 5th, that he was placed under MacMahon's orders, and the immediate consequence should have been his support of MacMahon with all his forces. This support he rendered too late and in an unsatisfactory manner. It seems strange that Failly 's first actual proof of having placed himself under MacMahon's command should consist in following the hurried retreat of the latter to the south in a still more hasty manner. On the afternoon of the 7th of August the 5 th French Corps reached Liitzelstein, on the 8th Lixheim, and on the 9th, the day the III. Army began to emerge from the Vosges, it stood at Saarburg, scarcely half a day's march from the XL Prussian Corps. This clearly shows what risk it ran of being overtaken and attacked during its retreat by the German troops. This retreat demoralized the 5th French Corps almost more than a lost battle would have done. The I. Bavarian Corps was to have an opportunity somewhat later of ruining what little cohesion and discipline was left. Of the enemy's movements in retreat, which have just been described, the Germans had no certain knowledge at the time in question, but they were in receipt of general and uncertain intima tions of the truth. It was known that part of the beaten army had moved to the south, and it was surmised that these troops had headed for Belfort. This supposition may possibly have arisen from the fact that, by some means or other, those who directed the movements of the German armies were aware of the arrival of large bodies of troops at Belfort on the 8th of August. These, however, were two Divisions of the 7th French Corps (Douay), of which one returned from Miilhausen on the 8th of August, and the other arrived from Lyons on the 1 3th. The advance of the III. Army was continued on the 13th, 14th, and 15th of August. On the last-mentioned day the Cavalry Brigade of the II. Bavarian Corps moved into Nancy. News arrived on the 15th August from the main army of a victory gained by General Steinmetz to the east of Metz. It was"], [46, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 38 expected that within the next few days a decisive battle would be fought there, and the next intelligence was naturally awaited with considerable anxiety. On the 1 6th of August, in the neighbourhood of Einville, the I. Corps had its first day's rest since the commencement of the operations (August 2nd). A month ago, July 16th, the mobili sation had been proclaimed, and to-day, after four victories, the German army stood in the capital of Lorraine and at the gates of Metz ! Irrespective of the brilliant successes and the unchecked advance during the fortnight of actual war, the Bavarians could congratulate themselves on the happy difference between the rapid and successful mobilisation on this occasion and that on a former one. Sixteen days after the issue of the order to mobilise, the I. Corps was on the left bank of the Rhine, ready to commence operations, and within ten more days the last reserves had joined. The trying marches had certainly caused considerable losses from fatigue and footsores, but had produced the inestimable advantage of eliminating the weak, and of accustoming the troops to march ing and trusting in their own capabilities. In the further advance of the III. Army, the I. Corps arrived on the Meurthe on the 17th of August, and crossed the Moselle on the 1 8th, taking up cantonments and bivouacks as near together as possible round Maizieres. On this day news arrived that a decisive battle would probably be fought on that very day near Metz, and the Officer Commanding the Corps in consequence kept the possibility in view of being quickly summoned towards the main army. The fortress of Toul closed one of the two high roads which lead direct to Pont a Mousson, so that the road vid Nancy would have been the only one available. The bridge across the Moselle at La Basse Flavigny, the pillars of which had been blown up, was therefore of necessity sufficiently repaired to answer all possible demands. A ferry too was established at Mereville. No order arrived, however, for parts of the III. Army to draw towards the main Army, but, on the contrary, the advance to the Meuse was continued. The I. Corps crossed this river on the 20th and took up cantonments close to each other about Void. The fortress of Toul was invested by the 7th Brigade (il. Corps)."], [47, "The March towards Chalons. 39 On the 20th of August the III. Army occupied the following general line : \u2014 The II. Corps was at Mesnil la Horgne, the V. Corps and Wiirtemberg Division near Treveray, the XL Corps near Gondrecourt, the I. Corps near Void, the VI. Corps near Lagny-la-Blanche-C6te, and the 2nd Cavalry Division near Creux sur-Meuse. The 4th Cavalry Division reconnoitred along the front of the army. In the meantime the Germans had gained a decisive advantage in the neighbourhood of Metz, where Bazaine had been pushed back and shut in behind the forts. Three German Army Corps, the IV., XII., and Guards, had been formed into an army under the command of H.R.H. the Crown Prince of Saxony, with orders to move with the III. Army in the direction of Chalons and Paris. All reports agreed that a fresh army was being formed at Chalons, under the command of Marshal MacMahon. The esti mate of its strength varied from 80,000 to 150,000. The Army of Chalons was formed as follows : \u2014 - 1st Corps (MacMahon's) now Ducrot's ; 5th Corps (Failly's). These two Corps, which had been considerably weakened, had reached Chalons by railway between the 17th and 25th of August, and had there been reinforced by twenty-five battalions. 7th Corps (Douay's), Two weak divisions of this Corps had embarked at Belfort on the 17th of August and reached Rheims, vid Paris, onthe 22nd ; the ist Division had remained with the Ist Corps after the battle of Worth. 1 2th Corps (Lebrun's). This consisted of four divisions, and had moved from Paris to Chalons. Finally, a small part of the 6th Corps (Canrobert's) had been left behind at Chalons to guard the camp. The German leaders had of course only a general knowledge of the constitution of the enemy's army, but might calmly await the result of the coming struggle. Eight army corps and the Wiir temberg Division, as well as four cavalry divisions, forming a total force of about 220,000, were moving westwards to attack the enemy at Chalons or wherever they might find him. At this period it was confidently expected that the French army would meet the German armies in its accustomed positions near Chalons, which were strengthened by field-works. Plans of the camp of Chalons, which had casually been taken away in"], [48, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 40 remembrance of days spent there, were now brought out, and the recollections of the configuration of the ground, of the man\u0153uvres and positions, impressed as they were on the memories of all those who had visited this school of the French army, were now refreshed and discusssed. Everybody was animated with the fullest confidence, and only trusted that the French army would soon allow itself to be found. To give the Crown Prince of Saxony's Army, especially the XII. Corps and the Guards, time to come up, the III. Army remained during the 21st and 22nd of August in the positions it occupied on the 20th. During the action round Metz, the IV. Corps, which also belonged to the Crown Prince of Saxony's Army, had approached the III. Army, in order to connect it with the I. and II. Armies, and on the 20th of August it was at Commercy, where it felt the touch of the I. Corps. On the 23rd of August the general advance in the direction of Chalons was continued. The I. Corps marched in rear of the 11. Corps, and halted on the 23rd about St. Aubin, on the 24th near Tronville and Ligny, and on the 25th between Bar-le- Duc and Revigny-aux-Vaches. His Majesty the King of Prussia allowed the I. Corps to defile past him on that day at Bar-le- Duc. On this occasion its cantonments were exceptionally extended. Of the Ist Infantry Division (Lieutenant-General v. Stephan), the Ist Brigade (Major-General Dietl) lay in Revigny, 12 English miles from Bar-le-Duc ; the 2nd Brigade (Major-General Orff) was in cantonments at Neuville-sur-Ornain, Laimont, and Vassincourt. The 2nd Infantry Division (Major-General Schumacher) had to occupy Chardagne and Bar-le-Duc with the 3rd Brigade (Colonel Schuch). One battalion (the 3rd of the 3rd Regiment) was on guard at the headquarters of the III. Army at Ligny. The 4th Brigade (Major-General Rudolph v. d. Tann) lay at Bussy-la-C6te and Varney. The Cuirassier Brigade (Major-General Tausch) was in cantonments in Laimont and Villers-aux-Vents, at the head of the I. Corps, at a distance of twelve English miles from Bar-le- Duc. The Reserve Artillery (Colonel Bronzetti) lay at Mussey. The trains were further to the rear towards Ligny. The distribution in the cantonments was arranged with a view to the continuation of the march in a westerly direction, which was expected to take place on the 27th of August, after one day's"], [49, "TJie March towards Chalons. 41 rest. The 26th of August, however, was not a day of rest, for the III. Army received orders from the King of Prussia's headquarter staff to concentrate on the line Changy \u2014 Possesse \u2014 Givry.

Corps, on the right with the IV. Corps which stood in Villers-en-Argonne. Patrols were to be sent forward to a distance of from two to three hours (six to nine English miles) in the direction of Suippe."], [50, "42 CHAPTER VI. THE MARCH TOWARDS SEDAN. DURING the night between the 25th and 26th of August, the fol lowing orders arrived direct from the Chief of the Staff of the Army, General v. Moltke : \u2014 \" The corps will not march to-morrow according to previous orders, but will cook a meal in good time and await further marching orders. (Signed) \" V. MOLTKE.\" Orderly officers were at once sent to countermand the projected march. As early as the 24th of August it had been rumoured that the French had abandoned Chalons, after setting fire to the camp ; but definite information concerning the enemy's further movements appears only to have reached the King of Prussia's headquarters in the course of August 25th, and on the morning of the 26th. The first news of the desertion of the camp of Chalons and of the enemy's march in the direction of Rheims was brought in by the Prussian cavalry divisions, to whose ability and boldness so many of our victories are due. But the French themselves afforded the Germans the most opportune assistance in discovering the real intentions of Marshal MacMahon. For their newspapers, which the Hussars and Lancers every where pounced upon in their bold excursions, boastingly announced that MacMahon was marching to join Bazaine, and prophesied in true French fashion the immediate destruction of the barbarians who had pushed into France, as the certain result of Marshal MacMahon's generalship. The writer of these lines remembers reading at this time, in one of the captured French newspapers, an innocent account by a fiery patriot, in which he gave in his enthu siasm the number of guns, the description of troops, and even the"], [51, "TJie March towards Sedan. 43 internal arrangements of a whole corps, and described the proud and confident bearing of the troops as they marched in an endless column through Rheims on their way to punish the barbarians. Thanks to the bold Prussian horsemen, thanks to the loquacity of the French, and thanks to the secret but trustworthy sources from which the German headquarters derived information, Mac- Mahon's intention, or rather Palikao's \" idtfe sublime,\" was learnt by the German leaders in time to cause its utter failure. In the King of Prussia's headquarters at Bar-le-Duc a myste rious activity was apparent on the forenoon of the 26th, from which even those not in the secret were led to surmise that some important event had occurred. A council of war was held under the presidency of His Majesty the King of Prussia, at the termination of which orders were issued to the various corps, directing the march on Chalons to be given up, and an advance to be made in a northerly direction. This sudden and unexpected change in direction necessarily gave rise to considerable difficulties, and entailed a large amount of work on the Officers Commanding Corps and their staffs, in regulating the march of the army. In the general orders issued at midday on the 26th, it was laid down that the Crown Prince of Saxony's Army, followed by the I. and II. Bavarian Corps, was that day to commence the movement in a northerly direction, as according to trustworthy information Marshal MacMahon's Army appeared to be concen trating towards Vouziers. The 5th and 6th Cavalry Divisions and the XII. Corps were already on the move. The remaining corps were to reach the following points on the same day : \u2014 The Guards, Dombasle ; IV. Corps, Fleury ; I. Corps, Exize la-Petite; II. Corps, Triaucourt. The corps were to march at once, and to be provided with provisions for three days. The King of Prussia's headquarters moved the same day to Cler mont. Half an hour after the arrival of the general order the necessary orders were issued to the different portions of the I. Corps. The great extent of the cantonments, which has already been men tioned, considerably increased the difficulty of issuing orders and concentrating the troops, in consequence of which the greater part of the army had to execute a most trying night-march. The ist Infantry Division was collected at Laimont, and com-"], [52, "TJie Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 44 menced its march at 5 p.m., the Ist Brigade in front, by Louppy le-Chateau and Louppy-le-Petit to Conde-en-Barrois and Marats la-Grande. The tributaries of the little Chee stream had over flown their banks, and no bridges were in existence. The infantry was continually obliged to make use of small improvised wooden bridges, owing to which the march was considerably lengthened and the columns separated, especially after nightfall. The ist Brigade entered into cantonments in Conde-en-Barrois ; the 2nd Brigade arrived about midnight and the early hours of the morning, at Marats-la-Grande and Rembercourt-aux-Pots. The march of the 2nd Infantry Division was equally difficult and fatiguing. It had been directed on Longchamp-sur-Aire, Pierrefitte and Nicey-la-Grande-Rue. Some of the detachments had to make a march of eight or nine hours (24 or 27 English miles) ; for instance, the ist and 2nd Batns. 13th Regt., which had been at Mogneville, off the high road, three and a half hours (10^ English miles) from Bar-le-Duc. The 2nd Infantry Division was collected at Naives-devant-Bar, and marched out of Bar-le-Duc by the northern exit between 5 and 7 P.M. No parti cular order of march could be maintained, but each detachment took its place in the column as it succeeded in extricating itself from the block of troops and carriages of every description. Darkness soon came on, and the roads were difficult to find. Halts and mistakes occurred to such an extent that the 3rd Brigade did not reach Longchamp till 1.30 a.m., the 4th Brigade Pierrefitte not till midnight. The Reserve Artillery had also to' march back to Bar-le-Duc, a distance of two hours (6 English miles), in order to issue from the northern exit of the town, and it reached its appointed destination at Rosnes and Exize-la-Grande at 9 p.m. The Cuirassier Brigade, which had been in cantonments at the head of the 1. Corps, arrived vid Louppy, Marats, and Exize-la-Petite, without being misled by other columns, at Chaumont-sur-Aire. Courcelles-sur- Aire, and Neuville-en-Verdunois in good time. The bad weather, which rendered the marches and bivouacks during the following days so trying, began on that day with a few very heavy showers. In accordance with general orders, one battalion had to be left till further orders at Bar-le-Duc to cover the Etappe, and for this duty the 2nd Batn. 3rd Regt. was detailed. The 3rd Battalion of the"], [53, "The March towards Sedan. 45 same Regiment had been on guard at the headquarters of the HI. Army at Ligny since August 24th, but had now moved thence, and was at the head of the 2nd Infantry Division. The Officer Commanding the Corps left Bar-le-Duc in the after noon, and towards evening arrived at Exize-la-Petite, a modest little village. General v. Moltke had informed the Chief of the Staff of the I. Corps, Lieutenant-Colonel v. Heinleth, by word of mouth, that for the present orders to the Corps would be issued direct from the headquarters of the King of Prussia. On the 27th of August, at 3 a.m., an order arrived from Clermont for the I. Corps , after cooking a meal, to march at 1 1 A.M. as far as Nixeville, and to take precautions against any attack from the direction of Verdun. The Army Corps had but a single road at its disposal. From Exize-la-Petite to Nixeville the distance is about seven hours (21 English miles). Reckoning the length of the whole column of route, including the interval between the advance guard and the main body, at only four hours (12 English miles), it was evident that the last detachments could not reach the bivouack till after midnight. On this account the Officer Commanding the Corps directed the intendance employes to go on in front, with a squadron of the 6th Lt. Cavalry Regiment, and to make the necessary arrangements for the bivouack of the troops which would arrive during the night. The result of their requisitions was not satis factory, and many detachments had to bivouack after the fatiguing march on the bare ground without wood or straw and in torrents of rain. This was caused partly by the short time allowed, partly by the want of necessary conveyances, and partly by the undue consideration shown for the inhabitants in making requisitions where the interests of the troops required a certain amount of severity. The following was the order of march : \u2014 The advance guard consisted of the 4th Brigade, with its Brigade Battery of 4-pounders, Sewalder's 6-pounder Battery, the 4th Lt. Cavalry Regiment, one subdivision of Engineers, and one subdivi sion of the Hospital Corps. Then followed the 3rd Brigade and the Reserve Artillery. Next came the ist Infantry Division, with the ist Brigade at its head ; the rear was brought up by the Cuirassier Brigade."], [54, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 46 The advance guard took up a position near Moulin-Brule, pushed outposts on to Landrecourt and to the eastern edge of the Bois-de la-Ville, and established communications on the north with the IV. Corps by means of cavalry patrols. The remaining troops of the I. Corps moved, in the order in which they arrived, into the bivouack, saturated as it was by the rain, between Nixeville and Souhesme-la-Petite. Some detach ments were very late in arriving ; the 1st Brigade did not reach the bivouack till 1. 30 A.M., the 2nd Brigade till 2.30 A.M., and the Cuirassier Brigade till 3 A.M. The Officer Commanding the Corps, who had accompanied the advance guard, took up his quarters at Nixeville. To the north of the I. Corps lay the IV. Corps, and the II. Corps bivouacked near Dombasle. Nothing further was known of the positions of the German corps. Of the enemy there was no news whatever. The vicinity of Verdun caused no anxiety to either the troops or their leaders ; no enterprise was expected from this fortress, and there was a general conviction that the garrison would only be too glad to be left unmolested. Late in the night an order arrived for a move on the 28th of August by Dombasle, Parois, and Neuvilly to Varennes. The march was begun in pouring rain at 8 A.M., in the following order: \u2014 Advance Guard : 3rd Brigade, accompanied again by Sewalder's 6-pounder Battery and the 4th Lt. Cavalry Regiment. Remainder of the 2nd Division, ist Infantry Division. Cuirassier Brigade. Reserve Artillery. On reaching Dombasle, where the II. Corps was just leaving its bivouack, the advance guard undertook the duty of guarding and securing the march. From Neuvilly the leading files of the advance guard reported the sound of guns in a north-westerly direction. The advanced party of the advance guard hurried forward at an increased pace, and soon sent a report back from Varennes, that after eight or nine shots the firing had ceased. With the exception of this report, which might possibly be founded on some mistake, nothing had been ascertained of the enemy and his movements. The Army Corps, as on the previous day, had only one road to march on, but it reached its cantonments and bivouacks in better time owing to its earlier start. The rest and refreshment which the bivouacks afforded to the drenched and tired men and horses"], [55, "TJie March towards Sedan. 47 were of a very doubtful nature, for the rain only ceased for short intervals. The ist Infantry Division, in very confined cantonments, occupied Boureuilles with the ist Brigade and Neuvilly with the 2nd Brigade. The 2nd Infantry Division was partly quartered in the little town of Varennes and partly in bivouacks immediately on the east of it. The Reserve Artillery bivouacked near Varennes, and the Cuirassier Brigade took up cantonments in Varennes, Cheppy, and Verry. The following was the position of the German corps on the 28th of August The Guards were at Bantheville, the XII. Corps was at Dun and Stenay, the IV. Corps at Montfaucon, the II. Corps at Vienne, and the 1. Corps, as has already been stated, at Varennes. Five corps, therefore, were prepared in one day's march to reach the points of Buzancy and Grand Pre, at which the French army must debouch, if it intended to continue its march from Vouziers in an easterly direction. Buzancy is about two hours and a half (7^ English miles) from Grand Pre, so that in this space the enemy would be met in front by about 140,000 men, while the XL, V., and VI. Corps, the Wiirtemberg Division, and two cavalry divisions, could attack him either on his march or in Vouziers. In the latter case it would be possible to bring up the two Bavarian Corps also, vid Grand Pre, and perhaps even the Guards in addition. All who found time to examine the situation with the help of a map were already convinced that Marshal MacMahon could no longer carry out his intention of marching. round the German army vid Dun and Stenay without a decisive engagement. It was strongly doubted whether the French leader would run such a risk. At General v. d. Tann's headquarters nothing further was known as to the place where firing had been heard in the morning. It was evident, from the general orders issued on August 29th, that the enemy had not yet passed Grand Pre or Buzancy. On this day the Guards were to move to Buzancy, the IV. Corps to Banthe ville, and the XII. Corps to Nouard. The II. Corps was to occupy Grand Pre, and the I. Corps was to take up a position between Grand Pre and Beffu. It was accordingly decided that the I. Army Corps should start at 7 A.M. on the 29th of August and march towards Grand Pre. The 2nd Infantry Division was to lead the way and move"], [56, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 48 into a position fronting to the west, with the right wing near Beffu, the left wing near Grand Pre. Immediately in its rear at Champigneulle, was the place assigned to the Reserve Artillery. Between that place and the high road leading to Grand Pre the 1st Infantry Division was to be in reserve. The Cuirassier Brigade was to remain at St. Juvin. It would for many reasons be interesting at this point to give a short account of the movements of the opposing army, so far as they have since been ascertained from trustworthy sources. A comparison of the enemy's movements with those of the German corps affords a striking proof, not only of the military genius and correct calculations of time and space of the leaders of the German forces, but also of their powers of induction, which enabled them to draw correct inferences from scanty information. Such a com parison also shows how much is due to the boldness and endurance of the Prussian horsemen. The army corps and smaller tactical units did not trouble themselves much about the enemy's movements. Leaders and soldiers alike knew that the next few days must bring about a crisis, and there was not the least doubt of a successful result. They felt the greatest confidence in the chief leaders and in their own capabilities, and regarded victory as certain. MacMahon's Army had commenced its march from the neigh bourhood of Rheims on the 23rd of August, on which day the magazines at the camp of Chalons had been set on fire. The French corps during their march saw heavy clouds of smoke floating over the neighbourhood which they had been taught to regard as the school of future victories. As is shown by the journal of a superior officer who fell somewhat later, the sight of this destruction raised curious reflections in the breast of many an earnest and thinking man, curious reflections on this nursery of victory on the chalky plains near Mourmelon. On the 25th of August the French army had reached the follow ing points : \u2014 7th Corps, Vouziers ; Ist Corps, Attigny ; 5th Corps, Amagne ; 12th Corps, Rethel. On this day the German corps were in full march on Chalons, and the I. Corps stood between Revigny-aux-Vaches and Bar-le-Duc. On the 26th of August the French army was further concen trated. The 7th Corps was still at Vouziers, the 1st Corps at Voncq, the 5th Corps at Chene, and the 12th Corps in rear"], [57, "Tlie March towards Sedan. 49 at Tourteron. In the evening the 7th Corps (Douay) detached one brigade to Grand Pre. It was not till this day that the German corps abandoned the original direction of their march and turned to the north. That night, after a most trying march, they reached the following points: \u2014 XII. Corps, Clermont ; Guards, Dombasle; II. Corps, Triaucourt ; IV. Corps, Fleury ; 1. Corps, Exize-la-Petite. The remaining corps of the III. Army were somewhat further in rear. From Grand Pre to Dun the distance is five hours (15 English miles), from Vouziers to Dun eight hours (24 English miles). The French 7th Corps might therefore have reached that point on the evening of the following day, August 27th. Similarly the 5th Corps might have reached Stenay, as Stenay is only eight hours (24 English miles) from Le Chene. The other two French Corps (1st and 7th) could, had they somewhat exerted themselves, have reached Dun and Stenay respectively on the morning of the 28th of August from Voncq and Tourteron. The German corps which were furthest advanced towards the north, viz., the XII. Corps and Guards at Clermont and Dombasle, were on the night of the 26th of August ten hours (30 English miles) from Dun, and as far from Grand Pre. With the greatest exertions these two corps, considering the bad ness of the roads, could not have reached the neighbourhood of Dun before the evening of the 27th of August, by which time, as we have already mentioned, that place might have been occupied by the 7th French Corps, which could have held its position until the Ist French Corps came up from Voncq, and the two other Corps (5th and 12th) had completed their passage of the river at Stenay. If the Meuse had once been placed between the German and French armies, the immediate result would have depended upon the forces and success with which Prince Frederick Charles could have met the army of relief. Marshal MacMahon did not execute his march with the rapidity that one is accustomed to see in German armies. It is well known that he undertook the march to the relief of Metz against his own convictions, and that he was in fact forced into it by a court council of war held in Paris. His reluctance perhaps induced him to see obstacles even where E"], [58, "T/ie Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 50 the Germans, notwithstanding all their efforts, were unable to place them. It will not, it is hoped, appear presumptuous to maintain that the success of the whole move towards Sedan depended on the correct and rapid employment of the two days, the 27th and 28th of August. MacMahon hesitated in the energetic execution of the movement which had been forced upon him, and was pre vented by distinct orders from Paris from carrying out the only operation which appeared to him to be correct, viz., a timely retreat to the west. With what rapidity and consistency, on the other hand, the Germans pursued their object was shown in the next few days. Instead of commencing its march towards Stenay and Dun in the early morning of the 27th of August, the French army re mained in general in the position occupied on the previous day \u2014 the 7th Corps at Vouziers, the 1st Corps at Voncq; the 5th Corps only moved to Chatillon, and the 12th Corps to Le Chene. The German cavalry had, however, already got the touch of the enemy. Near Buzancy the head of the 5th French Corps came on some German cavalry ; at the news of their approach Grand Pre, which was occupied by a brigade of the 7th French Corps, was quickly evacuated. It would almost seem as if MacMahon had purposely delayed, in order that he might be met by German soldiers \u2014 in what strength was immaterial \u2014 on the roads he was to follow, so that he might have a legitimate ground for a retreat to the west. On the evening of the 27th of August he reported to Paris that he would begin his march towards Mezieres and the west on the 29th of August. On the 28th of August the preparations for this retrograde movement were to commence, and the 1st and 12th Corps were to move to Vendresse, the 5th Corps to Poix, and the 7th Corps to Le Chene. In accordance with this order, the French corps began their movements early on the 28th of August. The Prussian cavalry touched the enemy at Vouziers, and set the village of Falaise on fire with shells, almost before it was abandoned by the rear guard of the 7th French Corps. During the night between the 27th and 28th of August, how ever, MacMahon had received a reply from Paris distinctly requiring him to relieve Bazaine."], [59, "The March towards Sedan. 51 The appointed march was accordingly countermanded, and as it now appeared too ' late to proceed by Stenay and Dun, it was decided to cross the Meuse further to the north near Remilly and Mouzon. The 1 2th Corps was directed on Mouzon, the ist Corps on Raucourt ; to cover this movement the 5th Corps was to advance again towards Buzancy. The 7th Corps, while passing through Quatre Champs on its march to Le Chene, received orders to halt and await further orders, and this it did nearly the whole day in a by no means favourable position. The fresh orders only arrived in the afternoon, as the first bearer of the directions for the alteration in the march was taken prisoner with his despatches by some Prussian cavalry. The 5th French Corps advanced according to orders in the direction of Buzancy, and came slightly in contact with some Saxon troops near Bar. Not feeling itself sufficiently strong, it demanded support from the 7th Corps, supposed to be at Boult aux-Bois, but which was in reality, as has been mentioned, still awaiting orders near Quatre Champs. Eventually the 5th Corps moved to Bois-des-Dames without making any determined attempt to advance towards Buzancy, and late at night the 7th Corps reached Boult-aux-Bois. These movements took place on the 28th of August, on which day the I. Bavarian Corps was near Varennes. To resume the interrupted thread of our narrative, a general order, as has already been stated, had been issued for an advance on the 29th of August into the line Buzancy \u2014 Grand Pre. The I. Corps was to be posted between the latter place and Beffu. At the time these dispositions were made at the King of Prussia's headquarters (midday, August 28th), the advanced parties had reported the presence of considerable masses of the enemy near Vouziers and in the direction of Le Chene. It was therefore expected that an attempt would be made to break through in the direction of Dun. At 1 A.M., August 29th, an order from the King of Prussia's headquarters reached the Officer Commanding the 1. Corps, according to which the march towards Grand Pre was to be relinquished and the Corps was to move at 5 AM. by Fleville to Sommerance, to take up a position there in rear of, and as a reserve to, the left wing of the Crown Prince of Saxony's Army, E 2"], [60, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 52 posted near Landres. The V. Corps was to approach by Grand Pre, the II. Corps by Cernay. The immediate result of this change in the orders and of the movements of the French corps given above would appear to be a stroke on the flank of the French army, should it have begun its march vid Buzancy, as it was firmly believed it had. This belief was confirmed on the evening, of the 28th of August by the report of the collision near Bar (Buzancy), and by news of the march of a French corps to Bois-des-Dames. In accordance with the order issued at 3 A.M., August 29th, by the Officer Commanding the I. Corps, the order of march decided on for the advance to Grand Pre was preserved, but Sommerance was substituted as the destination. The hour of commencing the march was fixed at 5 A.M. At the head of the I. Corps marched the 3rd Brigade, followed in close order by the main body of the 2nd Infantry Division, the 1st Infantry Division, the Cuirassier Brigade, and the Reserve Artillery. About 9 A.M. the 2nd Infantry Division, having moved by Fleville, arrived on the plateau to the north of Sommerance. Neither in Landres nor in St. Georges were there any detach ments belonging to the Crown Prince of Saxony, but to the east of Sommerance there was a bivouack of an ammunition detachment of the Guards. Patrols of light horse were pushed forward with directions to endeavour to establish communications with the Crown Prince's Army. The Officer Commanding the Corps immediately ordered a reconnaissance of the valley in which Landres and St. Georges lie, so as to be prepared for the possibility of a further advance. At a considerable distance columns of Prussian infantry were seen marching westwards towards Buzancy, but not a shot was heard, nor did any order arrive for the advance to be continued. The conviction was gradually forced upon us, that the enemy was avoiding a collision for the present and was retiring towards the west. This opinion was strengthened by a report which came in about midday. The Officer Commanding the Corps had ordered the 2nd Infantry Division to cook a meal where it stood, and had then ridden with his staff to Sommerance. During his absence, news came in from the ist Infantry Division that the Chief of the Staff of the Forces,"], [61, "The Marc/i toivards Sedan. 53 General v. Moltke, while passing the column, had given the Division direct orders to discontinue the march to Sommerance, and instead to take up a bivouack near St. Juvin, because on the following day the operations would probably be continued in a westerly direction. It would appear from this, that the King of Prussia's head quarters must have been in receipt of certain information concern ing the retreat of the French army, which made a pursuit to the west seem necessary. Of the I. Corps, the 2nd Infantry Division bivouacked near Sommerance, occupying Landres and St. Georges each with one battalion, and established communications with the Guards near Buzancy by patrols of the 4th Lt. Cavalry Regiment vid Sivry les-Buzancy. The 1st Infantry Division bivouacked near St. Juvin, the Cuiras sier Brigade near Fleville. The Reserve Artillery, owing to the mistake of an orderly, had not received the order issued that morning, but had marched, in accordance with the previous orders issued August 28th, to Champigneulle. It had been confirmed in its mistake by seeing the 1st Infantry Division, as has already been stated, marching in this direction, and the misunderstanding was not cleared up till it reached Champigneulle. In the afternoon the Reserve Artillery took up a bivouack near the 1st Infantry Division, in the neighbourhood of St. Juvin. Of the enemy nothing was known at General v. d. Tann's head quarters, except that during the day some French prisoners had been conveyed to Clermont. The surrounding villages were searched for arms, and some muskets and ammunition were found and destroyed. The pro vident French Government had, as we learnt, placed firearms with the mayors and priests, so that the defeat of the Germans, which was confidently expected, might be followed by their utter destruc tion at the hands of the armed inhabitants. The night between the 29th and 30th of August passed in perfect quiet. An order was expected at the headquarters of the Corps for a march in the direction of Grand Pre and Vouziers on the following day. Before proceeding to the events of the 30th of August, it may be as well to mention the movements of the French on the 29th. On this day the French Ist Corps reached Raucourt, where"], [62, "54 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. Marshal MacMahon also arrived, accompanied by the Emperor Napoleon. The 12th Corps crossed the Meuse near Mouzon j the 7th Corps had been ordered to march from Boult-aux-Bois to La Besace, but was delayed by the badness of the roads and a considerable column of wagons which accompanied it, and in con sequence it only reached Oches, where it took up a bivouack. The unfortunate French 5th Corps (Failly), which since the beginning of the war seems always to have been beaten before any fighting began, had made a feeble attempt on the 28th of August, as has been already stated, in the direction of Buzancy. On the 29th of August it repeated this offensive movement, with but little energy from Bois-des-Dames towards Nouarf where it came upon some troops belonging to the Crown Prince of Saxony. About 4 p.m. it began its retreat to Beaumont, where it arrived at 8 A.M., August 30th, much exhausted by its fatiguing night-march."], [63, "55 CHAPTER VII. BATTLE OF BEAUMONT. {August 2,0th) At 4 A.M., August 30th, the general orders for the day arrived, according to which His Majesty the King directed an attack to be made on the enemy posted between Le Chene and Beaumont. The general directions for the advance were as follows : \u2014 The I. Bavarian Corps will move by Buzancy to Sommauthe, and thence attack Beaumont by the high road. The Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony (Guards, XII. and IV. Corps) will also move against Beaumont, keeping on the east of this road. The II. Bavarian Corps will act as a reserve in rear of the I. Bavarian Corps. The V. Corps will march by Briquenay and Authe against Oches. The Wiirtemberg Division will move by Boult-aux-Bois and Chatillon to Le Chene, of which place it will endeavour to take possession. The XL Corps will move by Vouziers and Quatre Champs also against Le Chene, detaching a side column to Voncq. The VI. Corps will remain near Vouziers. The 5th Cavalry Division will move to Tourteron and patrol towards Rheims. The 6th Cavalry Division will occupy Semuy and send a detach ment to Bouvellemont [The enemy's immediate communications to the west would thus be interrupted.] The 4th Cavalry Division will await orders near Chatillon, the 2nd Cavalry Division near Buzancy."], [64, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 56 The Corps headquarter staff at once issued the necessary orders- Trie 2nd Infantry Division was to move by St. Georges, Imecourt, and Sivry-les-Buzancy to Buzancy, where it would receive further orders ; the 1st Infantry Division, together with the Reserve Artillery, to march from St. Juvin by Thenorgues to Bar, and similarly await further orders there. Lastly, the Cuirassier Brigade was to follow the 2nd Infantry Division from Fleville vid Sommerance. The Advance Guard of the 2nd Infantry Division, with which the Officer Commanding the Corps marched, was formed by the 4th Brigade (Major-General Rudolph v. d. Tann), consisting of the following troops : \u2014 7th Batn. Rifles (Lieutenant-Colonel Schultheiss). i oth Regt. ( ist Batn. (Major Heeg). (Colonel J 2nd \u201e (Major Leythauser). Guttenberg).

Sigmund's 6-pounder Battery, and the 4th Lt. Cavalry Regiment (Colonel Leonrod I.), were attached to the Brigade. At 5.30 A.M. the advance guard marched off from its bivouack near Sommerance in the direction ordered. On the way it met several transports of prisoners, of whom some had been taken from the enemy the day before, some that morning. With regard to the Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony, the XII. and IV. Corps were to attack Beaumont, while the Guards were to remain for the present in reserve near Buzancy, where their headquarters were already established. The 2nd Infantry Division made a short halt at Bar, and then received orders to advance further towards Sommauthe. The advance guard was to communicate on the right with the IV. Corps ; on the left, vid Pierremont, with the V. Corps. Directions were sent to the 1st Infantry Division, the march of which had been somewhat delayed, to rest for half an hour at Bar, and then to follow the 2nd Infantry Division to Sommauthe."], [65, "Battle of Beaumont. 57 From the leading files of the advance guard a report arrived from Sommauthe about midday, that four of the enemy's encamp ments were visible near Beaumont. The Officer Commanding the Corps, who was with the main body of the advance guard, hurried on with his staff to the leading files. He came up with them just as they were moving down to the wood which lies in the hollow, under the guidance of some of the inhabitants, whom they had secured with ropes. From a small height on the north of the village of Sommauthe, four encampments were distinctly visible, one on the east and one on the west of Beaumont, close to the little town itself, and two further to the rear on the slope of some moderate heights. In the camp on the west of Beaumont no movements could be dis cerned, owing to its being somewhat covered from view by the formation of the ground. The eastern camp was full of life ; smoke was rising from it, and men were busily hurrying hither and thither, soldiers in shirt-sleeves were going to the town or returning from it, but nowhere was a human being in uniform to be seen. Binoculars of every size and description, and also a large fixed tele scope, were brought to bear upon the camp. It presented rather the appearance of an encampment of gipsies than one of soldiers ; \u2014 not a sentry, not a vedette, was to be seen, still less any body of soldiers. The headquarter staff of the Corps began to doubt whether this camp was occupied by the enemy at all, whether the people whom they saw were not perhaps inhabitants of Beaumont or soldiers of the German XII. Corps, who had taken possession of the deserted encampment and were cooking their meal in it. The total disregard of any precautionary measures, even such as the posting of camp guards, &c, as are usual in mere camps of instruc tion, necessarily gave rise to these suppositions. Meanwhile the leading files had pushed on into the wood, and the main body of the advanced guard followed them at a proper interval in the following order of march : \u2014 4th Lt. Cavalry Regiment. 7th Batn. Rifles. Battery of 4-pounders (Baumiiller). Battery of 6-pounders (Sigmund). 2nd Batn. ) , _ . ist Batn. ) 3rd Regiment"], [66, "58 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 3rd Batn. 2nd Batn. \u2022 ioth Regiment. ist Batn. 1 Subdivision Hospital Corps. To the east of Sommauthe, on the edge of the forest of Beval, Prussian columns were perceived descending the hills and disappear ing in the forest which lies to the south of Beaumont. While the mysterious camp of the enemy was still under observation, the roar of cannon was suddenly heard in the west, in the direction of Pierremont or Stonne. At the same moment, as if at a precon certed signal, a heavy fire of both artillery and infantry was opened from the valley on the enemy's camp to the east of Beaumont. The iv. Corps had approached the French bivouack without being discovered or hindered any more than the Ist Corps. The advance guard of the latter was already in the wood. When the right wing opened fire, the two batteries hurried, trotting and galloping alternately, out of the wood on the north, took up a position on a height on the left of the road, and threw shells into the camp on the west of Beaumont. At 1 p.m. the Bavarian batteries fired their first shot. The three columns, the I., iv. and XII. Corps, could not have made their appearance more punctually than they did for the united attack. The 4th Brigade (till now the advance guard) began to form up with all speed on the left of the road leading to Beaumont. The 13th Regt. was in first line, the ioth Regt. in second line, the 7th Batn. Rifles and 3rd Squadron 4th Lt. Cavalry Regt. were in advance of the first line. The distance between the lines became disproportionately great, as during the deployment the leading battalions continued to advance. The Officer Commanding the Corps intended to cut off the enemy's retreat to the west. With this object, he ordered the 3rd Brigade, which was just coming up, to form on the left of the 4th Brigade, through which it could remain in communication with the IV. Corps, and then to advance in a northerly direction. The Officer Commanding the IV. Corps, Lieutenant-General v. Alvensleben, had also sent to the 4th Brigade, immediately on its debouching from the wood, and requested it to push forward in the direction of Pourron."], [67, "Battle of Beaumont. 5 g The 3rd Brigade (Colonel Schuch) advanced in the following order of march : \u2014 ist Batn.

The enemy was in the greatest confusion. ' The fields to the west of Beaumont were covered with Frenchmen retreating singly or in small detachments, presenting the appearance of so many red ants. Here and there a few battalions were seen to halt and attempt to get into something like a formation, but portions soon seemed to separate from the body, and the whole detachment to become again disbanded. The enemy's artillery alone formed a remarkable exception to the general disorder. It came rapidly into action, but being ruthlessly abandoned by its infantry and thrown entirely on its own resources, it was unable to maintain its position. Many will probably remember the French battery, which from the colour of its horses soon acquired the by-name of \" the white battery,\" and the brave manner in which it held out. At first, the defeat of the enemy who stood, or rather ran, before us seemed complete. The existence of the heights on the north of Beaumont led us to suppose that the enemy would make a stand there, where he might perhaps receive considerable sup ports, and that the decision of the day would depend on the taking of those heights. With a view to such a contingency, the Reserve Artillery, which was still in rear of the ist Infantry Division, was ordered to advance as quickly as possible. In the meantime there was a critical moment, although of short duration, in the battle that the Bavarian troops were fighting near Beaumont. The 4th Brigade had continued to advance towards the high road from Stonne to Beaumont, and the two batteries (Baumiiller and Sigmund) had taken up a position rather more to the front. The 7th Batn. Rifles and the 4th Lt. Cavalry Regiment were * The 2nd Battalion of this Regiment was still at Bar-le-Duc."], [68, "60 The Operations of the I.

At the same moment strong hostile detachments advanced from the forest which lay to the west, against the left flank of the 4th Brigade. At first the ist Batn. 13th Regt., which was on the south of La Thibaudine, was sent to meet this unexpected flank attack, while the 2nd Batn. of the same regiment, in conjunction with a few detachments of the 7th Batn. Rifles, took up a position near the farm itself. The 3rd Batn. ioth Regt., which was on the left of the second line, wheeled to the left, and advanced with the greatest bravery to meet the enemy. The hostile forces were, however, very superior in number, and the battalion, after suffering material losses, was obliged to abandon its brave but isolated attack. The moment was indeed critical. The 4th Brigade, with its three battalions (ist and 2nd Batns. 13th Regt., 3rd Batn. ioth Regt.) in the fresh alignment, could scarcely resist the forward movement of the enemy. The re maining two battalions of the second line (ist and 2nd of ioth Regt.) had not yet come up, and the 3rd Brigade was only just beginning to debouch from the wood with its leading detachments. The ist Batn. Rifles at length entered the line of battle at a rapid pace, and at once rendered assistance to the hardly-pressed 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. At the same moment, also, the ist and 2nd Batns. ioth Regt. joined the line. The 3rd Regt, which was following the 1st Batn. Rifles, was ordered to extend to the left and turn the enemy's right flank. About 3 p.m. the battalions assumed the offensive in the direction of Warniforet, in which movement they were strongly supported by Schropp's battery of 4-pounders. The ist and 2nd Batns. 13th Regt, the ist and 2nd Batns. ioth Regt., and the ist Batn. Rifles, together with the ist and 3rd Batns. 3rd Regt. on the left of the Rifles, kept pushing on unceasingly, and drove the enemy through the forest before them as far as and beyond Warniforet. The enemy lost several prisoners and two guns. The enemy's flank attack, undertaken by a Division (the ist) of the 7th Corps, had thus been brilliantly parried."], [69, "Battle of Beaumont. 61 Soon after the attack of the enemy upon the 2nd Infantry Divi sion, or rather upon the 4th Brigade, the head of the ist Infantry Division arrived at Sommauthe. The Officer Commanding the Corps was on the heights on the north of the place, and had just received a report of what had happened. The Officer Commanding the 1st Infantry Division, Lieut.- General v. Stephan, did not avail himself of the prescribed half hour's rest at Bar, but kept his Division on the move, in order to make up for the time lost by delays of one kind and another, and to take part as soon as possible in the battle. General v. d. Tann, at the commencement of the battle, had determined, as has already been stated, to press the enemy's right wing, with the object of preventing his retreat to the west. The report, which had just arrived, of the enemy's flank attack only confirmed the General in his intention, and he at once issued the necessary orders to the Officer Commanding the ist Infantry Division. This Division was to continue its march without delay, pass through the forest in its front in a north-westerly direction, and debouch from it towards Warniforet. By this movement the original intention of pressing the enemy's right wing was kept in view, and should he continue his offensive movement he might be seized in flank. These arrangements had hardly been made, when a Bavarian staff officer, belonging to the headquarters of the III. Army, arrived with the order that the I. Corps was to advance towards La Besace with its full strength. This order caused no alteration in the directions which had just been issued, La Besace being merely substituted for Warniforet as the object of the ist Infantry Division. It was evident that the fighting about Beaumont was becoming very fierce. The troops of the 2nd Infantry Division, which were engaged there, had fronted to the west. General v. d. Tann urged his troops to their utmost speed. At 2.30 P.M. the 1st Infantry Division moved into the forest in the following order : \u2014 3rd Lt.

The ist Infantry Division having begun its march, and the Reserve Artillery having received orders to follow it under escort of the Cuirassier Brigade, the Officer Commanding the Corps, who had been watching the execution of his dispositions from an excellent point of view on the heights near Sommauthe, rode towards La Thibaudine. When General v. d. Tann arrived at this place (3 P.M.) the 2nd Infantry Division had already made its offensive movement, which has been mentioned, towards Warniforet. In the neighbourhood of La Thibaudine there remained of this Division only the 7th Batn. Rifles, Baumiiller' s 4-pounder Battery, and the 2nd Squadron 4th Lt. Cavalry Regiment. These detachments had continued in their original direction towards the north, and had moved forward towards La Honneterie, after the enemy's counter attack had been successfully repulsed. They were joined by the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt., which had not taken part in the general offensive movement, but had received orders to remain near La Thibaudine, also by the ist and 2nd"], [71, "Battle of Beaumont. 63 Batns. 1 2th Regt., and Sewalder's Battery of 6-pounders, which had been kept back as reserves by the Officer Commanding the 2nd Infantry Division. General v. d. Tann at this moment received a request from the Officer Commanding the iv. Corps to support him in his further advance towards Villers-devant-Mouzon, where the enemy was offering a most stubborn resistance. This request could only be partly complied with, for the army headquarter staff had ordered an advance towards La Besace, in which direction the whole of the ist Infantry Division, the Reserve Artillery, the Cuirassier Brigade, and part of the 2nd Infantry Division had already moved. In order as far as possible to comply with the wishes of the Officer Commanding the iv. Corps, General v. d. Tann placed at his disposal the troops of the 2nd Infantry Division, which happened to be about Thibaudine. This mixed Brigade, under the command of Colonel Schuch, consisted of the 7th Batn. Rifles, ist and 2nd Batns. 12th Regt., 3rd Batn. ioth Regt, Baumuller's 4-pounder Battery, Sewalder's 6-pounder Battery, and the 2nd Squadron 4th Lt. Cavalry Regt. In the further course of the engagement this brigade advanced on the left wing of the IV. Corps, vid Voncq, on to the heights of Pourron. In the evening the two Bavarian batteries came into action at this point with considerable effect, especially Baumuller's 4-pounder Battery, which succeeded in demolishing a bridge of boats belonging to the enemy, and in thereby bringing his retreat into utter disorder. The Officer Commanding the Corps now went to Warniforet, where, in following up their successful offensive movement, seven battalions, two batteries, and two squadrons of the 2nd Infantry Division had arrived. The wood between La Thibaudine and Warniforet was strewn with knapsacks and rifles, cast away by the enemy in his retreat, which, according even to French accounts, was carried out in a state of utter disorganization from Warniforet in a northerly direction. A large number of killed and wounded were left on the ground during the retreat. About 4 p.m. the head of the 1st Infantry Division began to debouch from the wood in the neighbourhood of Warniforet. At the same moment a report arrived from the scouts, who had been sent on in front, that La Besace was free from the enemy, but that the wood immediately north of it was occupied by hostile forces of all arms. The 2nd Brigade, which headed the march, sent the 4th Batn."], [72, "64 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. Rifles on to examine La Besace, and then passed through the place and formed up on the north of it, a cheval on the road to Raucourt, with the 2nd Regiment in first line and the nth Regi ment in second line. The 9th Batn. Rifles was despatched to the left to examine the Bois-de-Raucourt. At 5 p.m., when the 1st Brigade had come up and deployed on the right of the road, in rear of the right wing of the 2nd Brigade, the whole of the 1st Infantry Division began its advance against Raucourt. In this offensive movement the intention was again to turn the enemy's right. With this object the two battalions (ist Batn. 2nd Regt. and 9th Batn. Rifles) on the heights to the left of the road were reinforced by the nth Regt. (ist and 2nd Batns.), while the ist Brigade and the two divisional batteries of 6-pounders remained in support in a position near Flaba. Grundherr's Battery of 4-pounders took up a favourable position on the left of the road, whence it could fire on Raucourt, and on the road leading to Remilly. In the meantime the left wing (9th Batn. Rifles) had reached the wood on the north of Raucourt, and the 1st Regt. (ist and 2nd Batns.) advanced by order of the Officer Commanding the Corps along the road directly against Raucourt. The enemy offered no earnest resistance, and, just as darkness came on, Raucourt and the heights round it were entirely in the possession of the Bavarians. Long after the engagement at Raucourt was over, violent fire of artillery and mitrailleuses was heard in the direction of Mouzon. The enemy was fighting there, so to speak, for his very existence, and the Germans compelled him to pay a heavy price for that existence. Towards evening the 4th Cavalry Division had appeared near Flaba, but too late to take part in the engagement. The troops of the 1. Army Corps bivouacked at the respective points they had reached when night came on ; the ist Infantry Division near Raucourt, the 2nd Infantry Division partly (seven battalions, two squadrons, and two batteries) near La Besace, and partly (four battalions, two squadrons, and two batteries) near Pourron. With the approach of complete darkness the whole of the Reserve Artillery of the Corps and the Cuirassier Brigade took up a bivouack to the south of Raucourt."], [73, "Battle of Beaumont. 65 The part taken by the I. Corps in the battle of Beaumont was both brilliant and eventful. Did it not seem paradoxical \u2014 the battle might almost be called a merry one. The beauty of the scenery, the mildness of the weather, the ludicrous manner in which the enemy had been surprised and scared away from the camp he had just pitched, the certainty of victory, everything in fact combined to produce a lively and joyful advance. Of the I. Army Corps the honour of the day is due to the 2nd Infantry Division, and more especially to the 4th Brigade and the 1st Batn. Rifles. This was the first occasion in this campaign on which these troops came under fire, and they had to stand a severe trial during the critical moments between 2 and 3 p.m. Seized in flank and almost in rear, the battalions had wheeled to the left and obstinately resisted the enemy's pressure, until they became in their turn strong enough to attack. Had the French succeeded in their attack they would un doubtedly have blazoned forth the old \" dlan irresistible \" in every possible key, just as they did later on the occasion of Coulmiers, \u2014 where, by the way, the elan became very feeble after five hours' fighting, and had no influence whatever on the retreat which had previously been determined on. We, however, will designate this attack of the 2nd Infantry Division by the more modest but thoroughly German word of \" schneidig.\" * The spirits of the troops, when the fighting began, were excellent, although they had been somewhat depressed during the trying marches of the last few days. Singing and shouting, the troops passed the Officer Commanding the Corps in their advance into the firing line. It is impossible to forget the manner in which the 1st Batn. Rifles marched into the fight with steady pace, singing a song about Napoleon, not of a very flattering nature. An hour later this battalion was found at Warniforet \u2014 it had made many prisoners and taken two guns, but many a merry singer had been silenced for ever. Our losses were as follows : \u2014 Killed, 3 officers, 58 men. Wounded, 12 \u201e 310 \u201e Missing, \u2014 51 \u201e 15 officers, 419 men. * Sharp. F"], [74, "66 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. General v. d. Tann took up his quarters in Raucourt, La Besace, which had first been chosen, having been selected for the headquarters of the V. Corps. The troops subsisted on what they carried with them, and on requisitions, which could certainly not be called \" organized.\" Before closing the account of the 30th of August, it would be as well to say something more of the beaten enemy. The 7th French Corps, as is well known, had on the previous evening only reached Oches, instead of carrying out its orders to march to La Besace. It was to have marched at 4 A.M., but was delayed in marching off by 1,500 requisitioned carriages, which were being dragged with the Corps, and had most unaccountably been parked during the night, partly in the village itself, partly to the south of it. At 9 A.M. MacMahon reached the 7th Corps from Raucourt, and ordered the march to Mouzon to be accelerated to the utmost extent. At 1 1 A.M. the Corps reached Stonne, where it halted for two hours, but being attacked by the V. German Corps continued its march after a short cannonade. (This artillery fire was heard at Sommauthe.) At this moment the 7th French Corps heard a fierce artillery fire in the direction of Beaumont. Douay con sidered himself debarred from marching towards the scene of action, by the repeated and explicit orders he had received from MacMahon to cross the Meuse as soon as possible. The 2nd and 3rd Divisions continued their march towards Raucourt, while the ist Division (St. Hilaire), with the whole convoy in front, had already moved off in the direction of Mouzon. It was this Divi sion which was opposed and thoroughly put to rout by the 4th Bavarian Brigade at Warniforet. St. Hilaire demanded that the artillery of his corps should support him. One battery (Leon) advanced at a trot, but near Warniforet it came under heavy infantry fire, and lost two guns (taken by the ist Batn. Rifles). The ist Division of the 7th Corps proceeded in disorder towards Villers-devant-Mouzon, while the 2nd and 3rd Divisions continued their march vid Raucourt, and were pursued beyond that village by a fire of shells. To the south of Raucourt one brigade (De Bitard des Portes) had entered into a rear-guard engagement of short duration with the Bavarian ist Infantry Division. Near Angecourt the"], [75, "Battle of Beaumont. 67 exhausted French Corps made a short halt. At midnight the infantry of the 7th French Corps continued its march towards Remilly, leaving the artillery of the 3rd Division and the whole reserve artillery of the Corps, thirteen batteries in all, without any escort, within two kilometres (about lj- English miles) of the German outposts. The artillery did not discover its fatal situa tion till two hours later, and it then hastily followed the infantry which had gone on in advance. Meanwhile the bridge at Remilly had become impracticable for artillery, and, according to French accounts, infantry and artillery in an utter state of disorganiza tion hurried along the left bank of the Meuse to Sedan, where they arrived thoroughly exhausted on the morning of the 31st of August Of the 1 2th French Corps one division was drawn to the left bank of the Meuse to cover part of the 5th Corps, which was retreating \" en debandade,\" but this division was eventually en tangled in the rapid retreat. The ist French Corps was at Carignan and intact. The Emperor Napoleon came to Carignan at 4 p.m. and went thence to Mouzon, from the heights of which he watched the battle or rather the defeat. From Mouzon he telegraphed to the Empress, that an engage ment of but small importance was being fought. In the face of what was really taking place before his eyes, it was a great instance of \u2014 self-deception \u2014 to send such news. The Emperor returned to Carignan and proceeded at 8 P.M. by railway to Sedan. The plan of marching to Metz was therefore definitely aban doned. F 2"], [76, "6S CHAPTER VIII. ENGAGEMENT OF REMILLY-SUR-MEUSE. {August 315/.) The night passed in perfect quiet. Some patrols of light horse, which towards morning had endeavoured to communicate with the Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony, reported that the left bank of the Meuse was free from the enemy, but that during the night several railway trains had been heard going towards Sedan. At 6.30 A.M. the orders for the operations of the 31st of August arrived from the headquarters of the III. Army, which were at St. Pierremont The distance from St. Pierremont vid Sommauthe to Raucourt is five hours (15 English miles). The orders were issued at 4.30 A.M., but the officer who brought them had also to take the orders to the II. Corps, lying near Sommauthe, and in conse quence of this, although he made the utmost despatch, he did not reach the headquarters of the I. Corps until 6.30 A.M. On this account it was impossible to start at the hour laid down in the orders. The general task assigned to the German army for the 31st of August was to follow the enemy, who had been beaten at all points on the previous day, to the Meuse, and eventually to push him over the Belgian frontier. The Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony was to advance along the right bank of the Meuse from Mouzon. The corps of the HI. Army were directed upon the following points : the Wiirtemberg Division to move to Boutencourt and take up a position there, the XL Corps to occupy Donchery, the V. Corps to move to Chemery and await further orders there, the VI. Corps to march to Semuy and Attigny, the I. Corps to take up a"], [77, "Engagement of Remilly-sur-Meuse. 69 position near Remilly, the II.

The advance guard was followed by the remainder of the 1st Infantry Division. The 2nd Infantry Division, which had not yet been rejoined by the mixed Brigade lent to the IV. Corps, was ordered to incline to the east and march from Raucourt to Petit Remilly. Later on it diverged from this direction, partly because the roads it was to use were hardly passable, partly because a lively cannonade was heard in the direction of Bazeilles and Remilly. It moved into a position to the north of Angecourt, where it would be in readiness for any contingency. The Reserve Artillery was directed to march in rear of the ist Infantry Division towards Remilly ; the Cuirassier Brigade was to be left for the present near Raucourt. Withaviewto the necessity of crossing the Meuse in order to press the enemy against the Belgian frontier in conjunction with the Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony, General v. d.

At the same time the Commanding Engineer, Lieutenant-Colonel Riem, was ordered to join the advance guard and reconnoitre the most favourable points at which to throw bridges across the river. The Officer Commanding the Corps, who was with the advance guard, received a report at 9.45 A.M. that large columns of the enemy were moving towards Sedan on the right bank of the Meuse. Almost at the same moment a cannonade was heard in the direction of Remilly. General v. d. Tann ordered the ist Infantry Division to advance at an increased pace, and two bat teries of the Reserve Artillery to come up as quickly as possible. He then rode through Angecourt to a height on the east of the road, whence the situation could be fully surveyed. Opposite to us, on the road leading from Douzy to Bazeilles and Sedan, considerable French columns could be distinguished marching in a westerly direction ; near Bazeilles and north of that village larger detachments of the enemy were visible. In the valley of the Meuse, on the south of the road just men tioned, the enemy had several batteries in position, which kept up a well-directed fire on our artillery on the left bank of the Meuse. The ist Brigade (till now the advance guard) soon completed its prescribed march, and with the 2nd Batn. Rifles occupied Remilly, upon which place the enemy kept up a heavy fire for some time. The ist Batn. Body Guards took up a position on the east, the 2 nd Batn. on the west of this road ; the 3 rd Batn. moved close up to the southern boundary of Remilly; the 1st Regt. and the 3rd Lt. Cavalry Regiment remained in reserve. Gruithuisen's 4-pounder Battery, and Schleich's 6-pounder Bat tery had taken up a position on the east of Remilly, where they were soon joined by Grundherr's 4-pounder Battery of the 2nd Brigade, which had been sent to the front. The remaining 6-pounder battery (Hutten's) of the ist Infantry Division, took up a favourable position on the west of Remilly. In face of the united fire of these four batteries, the enemy's artillery was unable to maintain its position. The batteries of the Reserve Artillery now also arrived. The Reserve Artillery, under the command of Colonel Bronzetti, was composed as follows : \u2014"], [79, "Engagement of Remilly-sur-Mcuse. 71 ist Div. j Prince Leopold's 6-pounder Battery.

In executing this movement, they came under a lively infantry fire from Bazeilles and the railway embankment on the right bank of the river. Of the five batteries which followed, two (Mehn's and Soldner's) were placed in position close to the batteries which were already in action on the heights to the west, while two others (Neu's and Prince Leopold's) took up a position on the east of Remilly. One battery (Hellingrath's Horse Artillery Battery of 4-pounders) remained in reserve near Remilly. By about 1 1 A.M., ten batteries were thus in action in very favourable positions, firing, partly on Bazeilles and its railway station, partly on the columns which continued to debouch from Douzy and move towards Bazeilles. These columns were gradually discomfited by the fire; most of them began, as far back as Douzy, to turn aside and march straight across the fields beyond the range of our guns. Some of the columns, however, remained on the road till they came within range of the batteries in position on the east of Remilly, when they quickly left it and marched over the fields and hills in greater safety, though not with the same facility. To cover the batteries, which were somewhat isolated on the heights to the west, the 2nd Brigade was ordered to despatch three battalions (9th Batn. Rifles, ist and 2nd Batns. nth Regt.) to the left flank of the guns, while the remainder of the brigade took up a position of reserve on the south of Remilly. About midday the enemy was observed to be making prepara tions for blowing up the railway bridge near Bazeilles, which was still in perfect condition. To prevent this and to preserve the bridge for later use, the 4th Batn. Rifles received orders to advance"], [80, "The Operations of the l. Bavarian Army Corps. 72 from Remilly towards the bridge. The 3rd company (Captain v. Slevogt) led the attack, followed by the ist and 2nd companies as supports, and the 4th company as reserve. At the same moment the enemy's preparations for blowing up the bridge were observed on our extreme left wing, where the three battalions just men tioned were on the heights with the batteries. The four skirmish ing subdivisions of the 9th Batn. Rifles, followed by two companies as supports, climbed down the steep heights, led by Captain Reitter, and joined the 4th Batn. Rifles, which had advanced with the same object, at the railway bridge. The 3rd company 4th Batn. Rifles, which was in front, charged across the railway bridge, followed by the skirmishers of the 9th Batn. Rifles, who would not be kept back. A supply of powder was found and quickly thrown into the Meuse, and a conducting wire for firing the mine was destroyed. Once they had begun to advance and were beyond the control of the superior officers, our brave riflemen were not to be kept back. Having crossed the bridge, they established themselves on the railway embankment, and by their lively fire compelled a French battalion, which was moving towards the bridge, to beat a rapid retreat. With their officers in front, they then pushed on against Bazeilles. The officers of the 3rd company 4th Batn. Rifles fell severely wounded in rapid succession, but the riflemen continued to advance, and pushed into Bazeilles. The three remaining companies of the battalion and three more subdivisions of the 9th Batn. Rifles now quickly followed. The sight of this coup de main against Bazeilles appeared to infect another detach ment of Rifles in the neighbourhood, viz., the 2nd Batn. Rifles, which, on seeing the advance of the 4th Batn. Rifles, advanced without orders to the Meuse, and sent a few detachments against Bazeilles. The events just related were accurately observed by General v. d. Tann, from his position near Remilly, but their course, after the bridge had been taken and secured, was by no means in accordance with his intentions. General v. d. Tann, having apprehended the general situation of affairs, had, during the forenoon, distinctly declared his intention not to assume the offensive and cross the Meuse, until the Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony should have approached on the left bank of the Meuse sufficiently near to enable a tactical co-operation to be established between them."], [81, "Engagement of Remilly-sur-Meuse. 73 This could not be done till the arrival of the Crown Prince's Army at a point about opposite to the junction of the Chiers and the Meuse. Till that time General v. d. Tann considered his chief objects to be the detention of the enemy and the preparations for insuring the rapid passage of the river. Soon after 2 P.M. orders were issued to the 3rd company of Field Engineers, which had meanwhile come up, to throw two bridges across the river near Allicourt, at a point which had been previously reconnoitred. The ist Brigade was to cover the con struction of the bridges, and was accordingly ordered to march to Allicourt. Lastly, to make the best possible arrangements for the passage, General v. d. Tann sent a request to the II. Corps at Raucourt to place four batteries of 6-pounders at his disposal. These arrived during the afternoon, and took up positions close to the batteries already on the heights to the west of Remilly. When the four batteries of the 2nd Infantry Division (which had arrived at 1 p.m. to the north of Angecourt) were placed in the firing line, General v. d. Tann had eighteen batteries (108 guns) in most favourable positions, ready to prepare for and cover the passage of the river and the deployment on the opposite bank. It would have been a great mistake to have assumed the offensive without awaiting the co-operation of the Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony, considering the formation of the ground and the strength of the enemy. The circumstances were quite different on the morning of the ist of September. Then the enemy was to be detained at any sacrifice, because it was known that he was to be surrounded, that the corps required for this object were already on the march, and that, however bad the situation might be, it must necessarily improve with every hour. Bazeilles is built entirely of stone ; most of the houses are large and stand in walled gardens. On the outskirts of the village there are several parks. On three sides of the village are heights rising in terraces. By occupying these heights with guns and mitrailleuses, as the French did on the 31st of August, it is easy to render it impossible for an enemy to debouch from Bazeilles. The distance between these heights and those near Remilly is too great to allow of artillery on the latter range firing with good effect upon the former. Some columns of the Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony were seen at 1 P.M. on the right bank of the Meuse near Mairy, with their heads advanced"], [82, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 74 only as far as Douzy, and halted there. It therefore appeared probable that the Crown Prince of Saxony did not intend to attack that day. On the other hand, it was clearly seen that the enemy had formed up his columns on the heights round Bazeilles, and that he was ready to meet any attempt on the part of the Bavarians to advance, by a concentric attack with considerable forces. During this time there was an unceasing rattle of infantry fire in Bazeilles. Our riflemen held out for nearly two hours at the northern boundary wall of the village, but as a matter of course they could not advance beyond it If General v. d. Tann had supported the troops, which had pressed into Bazeilles, the whole Army Corps would probably have been drawn by degrees into a fight, in which all the condi tions of ground and numbers were adverse to it, and in which no useful result could be obtained even with the greatest sacrifices. Shortly before 4 P.M., two guns (under ist Lieut. Hasler) were seen to cross the railway bridge and advance towards Bazeilles. At that moment the riflemen were slowly retiring from the village, and the guns therefore retired at a walk, notwithstanding the fierce firing, and recrossed the bridge. General v. d. Tann required great sacrifices from his soldiers when there was a fixed and clear aim in view, (as, for instance, in fighting for the same object on the following day,) but he was greatly exasperated at the purposeless though brave engagement of the Rifles, and gave a most stringent order for the troops to retire to the left bank of the Meuse, and merely to hold the rail way bridge. When two forces are contending in a local engagement, and the fighting on both sides is vigorously kept up, it is always a matter of time, requiring, as it were, a fresh engagement, for one or the other to break off the contest. The more it is the interest of the one side to free itself, the more does it become the interest of the other to remain in the closest contact possible with the evadin^ adversary. At last the riflemen were seen retiring in excellent order from the village towards the railway bridge and Allicourt. The enemy made no attempt at a pursuit, but merely kept up a fire of infantry upon them. After this General v. d. Tann entirely forgave his riflemen."], [83, "Engagement of Rcmilly-sur-Meuse. 75 Towards evening the enemy's troops were seen to encamp on the heights to the north of Bazeilles and cook their food. Bazeilles itself was occupied by him. Our artillery gradually grew silent when it found it could not reach the enemy ; now and again, if a detachment of the enemy advanced from Bazeilles, or showed itself on the road, a shell was sent whizzing on to the right bank. For the night the Officer Commanding the Corps made the fol lowing arrangements : \u2014 General Dietl was to take command of all detachments in first line on the Meuse, which were divided as follows: \u2014 On the extreme left, on the heights with the batteries, three battalions (9th Batn. Rifles, ist and 2nd Batns. nth Regt.). At the railway bridge, one company of the 9th Batn. Rifles and two 6-pounder guns. Between the railway bridge and Allicourt, two battalions, (ist and 3rd Batns. 2nd Regt.) At Allicourt, the ist Brigade, which had pushed the 2nd Batn. Rifles forward to guard the half-decked pontoon bridges. In addition, twelve batteries were during the night in position on the heights to the east and west of Remilly. The first reserve was formed by the remainder of the ist Infantry Division on the south of Remilly, (consisting of the 4th Batn. Rifles, 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt, Grundherr's Battery of 4-pounders, and the 3rd Lt. Cavalry Regt.) The main reserves consisted of the 2nd Infantry Division, bivouacking to the north of Angecourt, and the Cuirassier Brigade, which had arrived at that village at midday. The latter had sent the 6th Lt. Cavalry Regt. on to Remilly for the immediate observation of the bank of the Meuse. General v. d. Tann examined the pontoon bridges, and then rode by Allicourt to the artillery position on the left wing. The losses of the I. Corps during the day were as follows : \u2014 Killed, 1 officer, 16 men. Wounded, 8 officers, 1 11 \u201e Missing, \u2014 \u201e 9 \u201e 9 officers, 136 men. Almost all of these belonged to the 4th and 9th Batns. Rifles."], [84, "76 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. On the French side, the troops which came under fire, August 31st, belonged almost entirely to the 12th Corps (Lebrun). In Bazeilles our riflemen came into collision with marine infantry (Martin des Palliere's Brigade) belonging to that Corps. A superior French officer has written the following concerning the fire, which our batteries directed during the forenoon on the columns marching on the opposite side of the Meuse : \u2014 \" Et son arriere-garde (speaking of the 12th Corps), en arrivant entre Douzy et Bazeilles, fut ecrasee par un violent feu d'artillerie partant des hauteurs de la rive gauche de la Meuse ! \" This was all the Bavarian artillery desired, and it may be quite satisfied with this testimony to its performances on the 31st of August. General v. d. Tann took up his quarters at Angecourt, where the question was much discussed whether the enemy would not probably commence his retreat during the night, in order to escape betimes from the net which was being cast around him. A few hours later the I. Corps assisted in forcing the enemy to answer this question in the negative, and to remain until the trap was closed."], [85, "77 CHAPTER IX. BATTLE OF SEDAN. {September ist) At i A.M. an orderly officer from the Crown Prince of Prussia arrived at Angecourt with the following general orders for the ist of September : \u2014 The XI. and V. Corps will take up a position near Vrigne-aux- Bois to prevent the French army now standing near Sedan from marching towards Mezieres. The Wiirtemberg Division will construct a bridge during the night at Dom-le-Mesnil, and then take up a position on the road to Mezieres, with the object of watching that fortress and of forming at the same time a reserve to the XL Corps. The II. Corps will occupy a position on the heights of Fr^nois, opposite Donchery, with one division and the whole of the Reserve Artillery, while the other division will take post between Frenois and Wadelincourt, to prevent the enemy debouching from Sedan. The I. Corps will remain in its position near Remilly and join in the battle, when the Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony shall have sufficiently advanced. This army moved at 4 A.M. towards La Moncelle, Villers Cernay, and FranchevaL To these written orders a verbal message was added, that General v. d. Tann might use his discretion in attacking earlier, if the enemy could thereby be detained in his present position. General v. d. Tann resolved to attack at once. This resolution and the manner of its execution exercised an unquestionable influence on the course of the decisive battle of Sedan."], [86, "78 The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. The following are the reasons which induced General v. d. Tann to attack at once, without waiting for the Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony. From the evening of the 31st of August, when the cannonade grew silent and the French columns were being massed on the heights north of Moncelle, the conviction had forced itself more strongly upon us that the enemy would commence his retreat to Mezieres during the night, and thus attempt to place a large portion of his forces at least in safety. From Bazeilles and La Moncelle to the line of Ignes-Fleigneux the distance is not quite three hours (9 English miles). If the enemy's troops, which were encamped on the heights near Bazeilles, were to start silently at midnight, their rear detachments would reach that line by 5 A.M. at the latest. Once there, the French army might certainly be attacked by the V. and XL Corps, but would at any rate be beyond the reach of the Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony and of the I. Corps. To anticipate the expected departure of the French forces, and to detain them at the most distant point from their probable line of retreat, were the chief motives which induced General v. d. Tann to attack at once. By the seizure of Bazeilles the enemy would not only be detained on the heights to the west of La Moncelle, but his position on the heights to the east {i.e., in front) of that place would be turned and rendered untenable. The occupation of this place would also enable us to debouch unopposed across the Meuse and to co-operate later on with the approaching Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony. These were in general the chief grounds which induced General v. d. Tann to attack Bazeilles before daybreak. With regard to the execution of the attack, the opinion has often been expressed that Bazeilles should have been set on fire by shells from the commanding artillery position to the west of Remilly, \u2014 a very correct opinion, if it had not been too dark between 3 and 4 A.M. to do so, and if at that time the object to be effected had simply been to drive the enemy out of Bazeilles', as was the case later on between 6 and 9 A.M. It has, however, been already mentioned, that besides the seizure of Bazeilles the chief object was to entangle the enemy in a conflict there, and, as it were, to fetter him. If our artillery had opened fire at 3 A.M., and"], [87, "Battle of Sedan. 79 the enemy had really had the intention of marching off before daybreak, the artillery fire would only have accelerated his departure, and we should thus have brought about the exact result which we wished to prevent. If, on the other hand, it was not in the plan of the French leader to march off, \u2014 a third case, viz., that he should have made no arrangements whatsoever was naturally not to be presupposed at that time, \u2014 a heavy cannonade would have directed the enemy's attention to our plans, he would probably have evacuated Bazeilles, and we should have shelled the place into ruins. In the meantime the enemy could have quietly concentrated his forces beyond the range of our guns on the heights to the east of La Moncelle. At daybreak the I. Corps would certainly not have had to storm Bazeilles, but if it wished to co-operate at all with the Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony, it would have had to cross the Meuse and its broad valley, completely commanded by the enemy's guns, under the most unfavourable conditions. It may be doubted whether this would have been accomplished with less loss than was later incurred in taking Bazeilles. On the other hand, it could not be expected that General v. d. Tann, after the enemy had been alarmed by his cannonade, and had consequently moved into position, would idly look on from the left bank until the Army of the Crown Prince of Saxony should have cleared the way for him. The enemy was to be detained at all risks, but this could only be insured by an attack at close quarters, owing to the nature of the ground. Secrecy and rapidity were necessary elements in the critical operation of crossing the Meuse and surprising the enemy. The attack must therefore be made in silence and by night. The I. Corps was constituted as on the 30th and 31st of August. An impenetrable mist, precluding all view, lay over the whole valley of the Meuse at 2.30 A.M., when General v. d. Tann, accom panied by the Chief of his Staff and very few staff officers, arrived at Allicourt. The night had passed in perfect quiet. Communications had been opened with the head of the XII. Corps at Douzy by means of a light dragoon, who had crossed the Meuse in a small boat and then stolen on foot to Douzy. The arrangements were at once made for the attack, and the decking of the pontoon bridges was noiselessly completed."], [88, "80 The Operations of tlie I. Bavarian Army Corps. The passage was to be effected by the railway and pontoon bridges simultaneously. The 1st and 3rd Batns. 2nd Regt. were to advance across the railway bridge with the 4th company 9th Batn. Rifles at their head. This company had been posted at the bridge during the night. The whole of the 1st Brigade was to advance to the attack from Allicourt across the pontoon bridges, the 2nd Batn. Rifles leading, followed by the 1st Regt. and then by the Regt. of Body Guards. The remainder of the 1st Infantry Division, which stood on the south of Remilly, was ordered to follow the 1st Brigade across the pontoon bridges. (It consisted of the 4th Batn. Rifles, 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt, Grundherr's 4-pounder Battery, and the 3rd Lt. Cavalry Regt.) The 2nd Infantry Division was directed to follow the 1st In fantry Division, but to leave the 4th Brigade and two batteries for the present in reserve on the left bank of the Meuse near the pontoon bridges. To the three battalions * on the heights on the extreme left the task was assigned of holding the railway bridge under all circum stances. The artillery in position finally received a distinct order not to open sire for the present. General v. d. Tann remained at Allicourt and awaited with some impatience the completion of the preparations, the difficulties of which were considerably increased by the darkness. Every minute appeared precious. The most perfect quiet reigned on the opposite bank of the Meuse. Shortly before 4 A.M., and almost simultaneously, the columns began to cross the bridges. The 1st Batn. 2nd Regt. (Major Sauer) and the 4th company 9th Batn. Rifles, with the 3rd Batn. 2nd Regt. (Major Steurer) on their right, pressed into Bazeilles somewhat sooner than the head of the 1st Brigade, consisting of the 2nd Batn. Rifles (Major Vallade). The outskirts of the village were unoccupied ; the companies pressed on with cheers until they reached some barricades, when a savage street engagement took place. The enemy (marine infan- * ist and 2nd Batns. nth Regt., three companies 9th Batn. Rifles."], [89, "Battle of Sedan. 81 try) had established a military occupation of the houses on the previous evening, but had posted very few sentries, so that he was literally roused from sleep by our attack. The garrisons of the houses opened a murderous fire at short ranges on the front, flanks, and rear of the detachments which had pressed into the village. To attempt to describe the fighting in the place during the following six hours would be fruitless. All that can be done is to state approximately when and where fresh forces pushed their way into the fray. Bazeilles was defended by a brigade of marine infantry, and consisted, as has already been stated, entirely of stone houses. At the south-eastern extremity of the village stood a castle in a walled park, which at the first attack fell permanently into our hands. At the opposite (north-western) extremity of Bazeilles was another castle, with a park bounded on three sides by high walls and intersected by a stream (Muhlbach). This castle immediately adjoined the heights which lie to the north-west, and afforded an excellent point d'appni to the enemy, which he most stubbornly defended. The position of this park also enabled the enemy continually to pour fresh troops, by a covered road, into the interior of Bazeilles. With regard to the movements of the ist Brigade, an order was given to the 2nd Batn. ist Regt. (Major Daffenreither), which followed the 2nd Batn. Rifles, to occupy the railway station of Bazeilles, whence the eastern exit from the place could, if necessary, be commanded. The ist Batn. of this Regiment (Major Liineschloss) was to advance along the eastern outskirts of Bazeilles and en deavour to take the defenders of the place in flank. The battalion moved along a high park wall (belonging to the park mentioned as lying to the north-west) without finding an entrance ; in this movement it came upon the stream called the Muhlbach, the bank of which it followed under the raging fire of the enemy as far as La Moncelle. Here it established itself in the first houses it came to. The three battalions of Body Guards had meanwhile moved into the village, and had at once been entangled there in a most obstinate engagement. The ist Batn. (Major Eckart) had estab lished itself in the eastern part of the village ; the 2nd Batn. (Major Bauer) had followed the 2nd Batn. Rifles, and had advanced G"], [90, "82 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. about as far as the point at which the main street makes a great bend to the north-east. The 3rd Batn. (Major Joner), consisting of only two companies, had advanced along the western outskirts, where it found the detachments of the 2nd Regt. offering an obstinate resistance to the enemy, but being gradually compelled to give way from point to point by the pressure upon them from all sides. The Officer Commanding 1st Batn. 2nd Regt, Major Sauer, had at the com mencement of the fight avoided a barricade by moving down a by-lane, and had proceeded as far as the northern boundary of Bazeilles, where he had occupied a corner house in an important situation with two officers and a few men. The detachments of the 2nd Regt. were pushed back by the powerful pressure of the enemy on all sides, and some supports, which an officer had been despatched by Major Sauer to bring up, were unable to fight their way through. The enemy now made a simultaneous attack on the corner house from all sides, and Major Sauer was forced to surrender with his handful of men, after holding this perfectly isolated post for nearly three-quarters of an hour.* By 6 A.M. the remainder of the 2nd Brigade had arrived at the south-eastern extremity of Bazeilles. No progress was being made in the engagement in the interior of the place, and it was with great difficulty that the detachments, which had pressed in, were able to maintain their position. The enemy, favoured by a thick fog, continued to push forward with fresh forces, more espe cially along the western outskirts. In that direction the Officer Commanding the 2nd Brigade despatched the 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt. (Major Mehn) in support, but this battalion, together with the 3rd Batn. Body Guards, was unable to fight its way through, and could only keep its position close to the church and the adjoining houses. * If Major Sauer could have been supported, the fight for the possession of Bazeilles would have been considerably facilitated, for the corner house in question was situated at the extreme north-western exit of the place, from which point the entrance of fresh troops of the enemy might have been prevented. Major Sauer was taken to Sedan. On his way he saw the 12th French Corps drawn up on the heights to the north-west of Bazeilles, and near Balan he met the Emperor Napoleon and his suite coming from Sedan (about 7 A.M.). The treatment of the prisoners on the part of the French officers was in accordance with military custom, but the inhabitants of Sedan exhibited the coarsest exultation at the unusual sight of German prisoners ; so much so, indeed, that even the French officer in command of the escort was ashamed of their behaviour. Major Sauer was released on the afternoon of the 2nd of September with all the German prisoners (about 200 in number)."], [91, "Battle of Sedan. 83 Lieutenant-General v. Stephan, commanding the ist Infantry Division, had thus the whole of his infantry engaged in the village, with the exception of the three battalions* posted at the railway bridge. In order to prevent the enemy from pressing forward towards Bazeilles from the heights to the north-east, and in order to batter the enemy's artillery posted there, Lieutenant- General v. Stephan ordered Hutten's Battery of 6-pounders to move on to the heights to the east of La Moncelle, where this Battery bravely maintained itself, and performed most excellent service for the next three hours. It was now about 7 A.M. Scarcely half of Bazeilles was taken, and the enemy continued to pour in reinforcements. About this time the mist began to clear off, and the Reserve Artillery received orders to open fire on the French columns, which showed themselves to the north-east of Bazeilles. One of the first shots wounded Marshal MacMahon, who had arrived near Bazeilles. The head of the 2nd Infantry Division had now also crossed the Meuse and reached the scene of action. The 3rd Brigade (Colonel Schuch) led the column, and advanced along the large park wall, by the road which the ist Batn. ist Regt. had taken at the commencement of the fight. The ist Batn. Rifles (Lieutenant-Colonel Schmidt) and the ist Batn. 3rd Regtv (Major Kohlermann) were to push on to the left through the park up to the northern houses of Bazeilles. By some mistake only a company and a half of Rifles moved into the park, while the remaining companies of Rifles and the ist Batn. 3rd Regt. advanced by La Moncelle as far as Petit Moncelle, where they established themselves, after ejecting some Turcos (of the Ist French Corps) whom they found there. The company and a half of Rifles just referred to consequently received as reinforcements a wing of the 3rd Batn. 3rd Regt. (Major Muck) and a wing of the ist Batn. 12th Regt. (Major Kress) ; the remainder of the 3rd Brigade -f- took up a position along the Muhlbach, between La Moncelle and the north-eastern corner of the park.

Bavarian Army Corps. 84 Infantry Division, took up a position by the side of Hutten's Battery. General v. d. Tann, from the heights near Allicourt, had directed the passage of his Corps across the Meuse and its advance against Bazeilles. The 4th Brigade was on the point of crossing the pontoon bridges, when it was ordered to send three battalions across the railway bridge to attack Bazeilles on the south, and to let the remaining battalions advance across the pontoon bridges. Already, on the fighting becoming serious, General v. d. Tann had requested the Officer Commanding the IV. Corps, instead of remaining according to orders on the lest bank of the Meuse, to cross the river with part of his force, so as to follow eventually in support of the I. and XII. Corps. It did not seem probable that the corps engaged on the right bank would be driven back across the Meuse and require to be covered on the left bank, but it was certainly possible that the enemy might gain a momentary advantage near Bazeilles by means of desperate efforts, and in that case it would be necessary to have an intact reserve immediately at hand. Lieutenant-General v. Alvensleben complied with General v. d. Tann's request with the greatest readiness, and ordered the 8th Division and the Divisional Artillery to cross the Meuse. When the last instructions had been given to the 4th Brigade, which was just defiling over the bridges, General v. d. Tann rode close up to Bazeilles, about a hundred yards from the point where the road from Douzy enters the village. The battle was raging as fiercely as ever. The French, who fought with signal bravery, kept tenacious possession more especially of those houses which commanded some of the streets. The garrisons of some large houses in the centre, and the garrison of the castle at the north-western extremity of the village, inflicted great losses upon our troops, and it was only by smoke and flames that they were ultimately driven out. Bazeilles caught fire soon aster 8 A.M. The fire soon spread, and the flames forced the enemy to abandon the houses, whereby many prisoners were taken, but the intense heat and suffocating smoke drove our soldiers out of many of the streets. In order to take one of the most stubbornly defended houses, Major-General Orff had two 4-pounder guns brought into one of"], [93, "Battle of Sedan. 85 the village streets to batter the house in question at the shortest possible range, and by this means it was at last made possible to storm it. But when the same guns advanced into the main street to batter the castle, which has several times been mentioned as lying on the north-west, and which commanded the whole street, half the gunners were either killed or wounded in a very few moments, and the guns were obliged to be retired. For about an hour after 8.30 A.M., when General v. d. Tann arrived at Bazeilles, the situation of the I, Corps was most critical. From Bazeilles report after report came demanding reinforce ments, but the critical point was not so much there as in the gap between La Moncelle and the park. Against this spot fresh columns of the enemy advanced from the heights to the north east of Bazeilles, and pushed with great bravery into the park and on towards the Muhlbach. The 3rd Brigade was almost entirely extended in the park and along the Muhlbach in a single skir mishing line, without any closed supports, and part of the troops actually without cartridges. Nevertheless, it firmly held its ground, though not without very sensible losses. The 48th Saxon Brigade was engaged at this time next to, and partly mixed up with, the 3rd Brigade on the Muhlbach, in the park and at La Moncelle. On the heights from which the hostile infantry poured down, the enemy had several batteries of guns and mitrailleuses, which deluged the park and the whole space between Bazeilles and the heights to the east of La Moncelle with a perfect hail-storm of shells. This was evidently the tract of ground against which the enemy intended to make his offensive stroke. Sigmund's Battery of 6-pounders, which was posted on the immediate left of Hutten's Battery (on the east of La Moncelle), was forced to move off, and the latter battery was hardly able to stand fast under the continued and effective infantry fire of the enemy. Every minute the enemy's fire increased. First the Officer Commanding the ist Infantry Division, and then the Officers Commanding the two Brigades, which had now been engaged in Bazeilles for nearly four hours, urgently demanded support, while a report came from the 3rd Brigade that it could no longer resist the enemy's pressure unless reinforced. General v. d. Tann, with his staff, was still halted on the road"], [94, "86 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. from Douzy to Bazeilles, and at once took measures, through his Chief of the Staff, Lieutenant-Colonel Heinleth, to parry the enemy's blow. In the very nick of time that part of the 4th Brigade, which had advanced across the pontoon bridges, arrived at Bazeilles : namely, the ist and 2nd Batns. ioth Regt., Sewalder's 6-pounder Battery, and Schropp's 4-pounder Battery. The 7th Batn. Rifles (Lieutenant-Colonel Schultheiss), which also belonged to this column, had already, on the urgent requisition of the ist Infantry Division, advanced towards the southern and western outskirts, to assist the hardly-pressed 2nd Regt. The most vulnerable point was the gap near La Moncelle. The ist Batn. ioth Regt. (Major Heeg) was at once directed to the northern side of the park, the 2nd Batn. (Major Leythauser) of the same Regt. was, on the other hand, sent to La Moncelle. The two batteries (Sewalder's 6-pounders and Schropp's 4-pounders) were led by the Officer Commanding the Divisional Artillery, Major Mussinan, into positions on the right and left of Hutten's 6-pounder Battery, which still held out and maintained its ground. Of the brigade forming the advance guard of the 8th Division, General v. d. Tann let one battalion move up to the gap. Together with these reinforcements, a fresh Brigade, the 46th, belonging to the XII. Corps, advanced towards the threatened gap and towards La Moncelle. Of the division of the IV. Corps which had crossed to the right bank, the brigade forming the advance guard and four batteries were placed at the disposal of General v. d. Tann. There was no space on which to post the artillery, but of the proffered infantry the General sent one battalion into the park. The crisis was thus averted, but in Bazeilles itself the progress made was but small ; part of the troops had expended their ammu nition, and all were exhausted. At this point, however, supports also arrived at the right moment, with the assistance of which the last resistance of the enemy was at length broken. The column, which advanced across the railway bridge,* had originally received orders, as has been stated, to attack Bazeilles on the south, from which side some detachments of the 1st Infantry Division had been compelled to withdraw. The Chief of * Viz., ist and 2nd Batns. 13th Regt., 3rd Batn. ioth Regt., and Baumuller's 4-pounder Battery."], [95, "Battle of Sedan. 87 the Staff of the 2nd Infantry Division, Lieutenant-Colonel Muck, directed the column, however, on his own responsibility, to advance along the eastern side of Bazeilles, in order to join in the fight at the decisive point in the gap and park which have so often been mentioned. It was about 9.30 A.M. when these battalions arrived at Bazeilles. In consequence of an urgent request from the regiment of Body Guards, a wing of the 3rd Batn. 10th Regt. (Major Lacher), which was at the head of the column, advanced straight to the main street of the village, while the remaining wing marched into the park, followed by the ist Batn. 13th Regt. (Major Endres), and a little later by the 2nd Batn. 13th Regt. (Major Schonhueb). These fresh troops of the 4th Brigade at last decided the possession of Bazeilles ; the enemy, worn out by the obstinate tenacity of the ist Infantry Division, could not withstand this last attack from all sides. The adversary gradually retired, still fighting, from one line of defence to another, closely followed by our infantry. He moved to the heights on the north-west of Bazeilles and towards Balan. The 3rd Batn. ioth Regt., in conjunction with some detachments* of the 13th Regt., had succeeded in taking the castle at the north-western entrance to Bazeilles, and in making prisoners of the garrison. Soon after 10 A.M. Bazeilles was definitely in our hands, after a desperate fight of more than six hours. The enemy's troops which fought here performed their duty to the fullest extent. The Marine Infantry fought with a bravery and obstinacy very different to the proverbial French \" elan\" which so soon evaporates. Again and again they pressed on, occupying even the burning houses ; at several points bayonets were actually crossed, and it often happened that the defenders could only be ejected from the houses by the help of smoke and flame. Of the I. Corps fifteen and a half battalions and two 4-pounder guns had taken an immediate part in the contest for the village. About the same time that Bazeilles was taken, the troops f on the Muhlbach and in La Moncelle assumed the offensive against the heights in their front, which were strongly occupied by the * Led by Captain Lissignolo. + Viz., ist Batn. ist Regt., half ist Batn. 12th Regt., 2nd Batn. 12th Regt., 3rd Batn. 3rd Regt., part of ist Batn.

A small farm, lying immediately on the slope, was first seized, and from it a musketry engagement was kept up for some time at a distance of only sixty paces. At length the whole line made a forward rush, intermingled with troops of the XII. Corps, to attack the crest of the heights, and the enemy was driven off in the direction of Balan, pursued by two companies of the ioth Regt. and a company of the 3 rd Regt. (led by Captain Kraft), as far as a wood to the north-west of Balan. The first care of the Officer Commanding the I. Corps was to collect his troops, which had been scattered in the street fighting, and to have fresh ammunition served out to them ; for although no one had the least doubt as to our ultimate victory, it was not unlikely that the enemy would strike a last desperate blow in the exact direction of the I. Corps. General v. d. Tann ex pressed this view soon after Bazeilles was taken, and made arrangements accordingly to retain the ground so hardly won under all conditions, and by a counter attack to parry every attempt of the enemy to regain what he had lost. The Reserve Artillery, which had left the heights near Remilly at 9 A.M., and had crossed the Meuse by the pontoon bridges, received orders to move to the heights west of La Moncelle with five batteries of 6-pounders ; the 8th Division took the same direction, the 48th Saxon Brigade and the 1st Saxon Division* (Lieutenant-General v. Montbe) having moved further to the north towards Daigny to effect a junction with the Guards. These Saxon troops (45th, 46th, and 48th Brigades) had strongly sup ported the I. Corps, especially at La Moncelle and during the critical hour from 9 to 10 A.M. Lieutenant-General v. Montbe, although he received the order to march towards the north just as the Bavarian troops near La Moncelle were about to attack the heights before them, remained on his own responsibility in the position he then occupied for nearly another hour, and, by assisting with part of his division to storm the heights, greatly facilitated the attack. Soon after the taking of Bazeilles a request reached the I. Corps from the Crown Prince of Saxony, that it should not advance further towards Fond de Givonne, but should give the Guards and XII. Corps time to surround the enemy. On this No. 23 of the North German Army."], [97, "Battle of Sedan. 89 account immediate arrangements were made for continuing the fight with artillery alone. General v. d. Tann took the following further precautions : \u2014 The 1st and 4th Brigades occupied the northern and western outskirts of Bazeilles, in order to resist any offensive stroke that the enemy might make. The 3rd Brigade was collected near La Moncelle, and occupied that place, while the 2nd Brigade was left in reserve at Bazeilles. On the extreme right wing of the 4th Brigade, close to the northern boundary of the park, stood the 1st and 2nd Batns. 10th Regt., and next to them the ist and 2nd Batns. 13th Regt. ; Beurman Castle was occupied by the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. The 7th Batn. Rifles, which belonged to this brigade, in following the retreating enemy beyond Bazeilles, had advanced as far as Balan, where it fought in conjunction with the 3rd Infantry Division. With regard to the ist Brigade, the ist and 2nd Batns. Body Guards were in the park, the 2nd Batn. ist Regt occupied the western outskirts as far as the northern exits, the ist Batn. ist Regt. was still at La Moncelle, the 3rd Batn. Body Guards had taken over the occupation of the railway station from the 2nd Batn. Rifles, which remained in reserve in the main street. The Cuirassier Brigade had crossed the Meuse towards noon, and was now in reserve on the east of Bazeilles. Just as Bazeilles was completely taken, a division of the II. Corps, which was still on the left bank of the Meuse, was placed at the disposal of General v. d. Tann, by the Officer Commanding the III. Army. This Corps had remained intact, both at the battle of Beaumont and in the fighting on the 31st of August; in the battle that was now raging it had taken no part excepting with its artillery, which had been firing from the heights of Frenois on the fortress of Sedan. Most welcome was the support of a perfectly fresh and untired division. General v. d. Tann directed the Officer Commanding, Lieutenant-General v. Walther, to cross the railway bridge, advance along the valley towards Balan and the heights there, and take them. General v. d. Tann pro posed by this movement, on the one hand to turn the heights, which were partly wooded and would have been difficult to attack in front, by sending troops along their foot, and on the other hand to contract as much as possible the circle in which the French army was to be enclosed. If Balan and the adjacent heights"], [98, "The Operations of tlte i. Bavarian Army Corps. 90 should be taken, the enemy would be obliged to retire within the walls of Sedan, in which case he would be unable to find space to develope any important force for a fresh attack. Of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 5th Brigade* was the first to march against and through Balan ; it occupied a ridge of heights lying to the north-west of this place in the direction of Fond de Givonne, where a fierce engagement developed itself. The French, pushed back towards Sedan from all sides, were involuntarily con centrating upon that town, and they now directed all their efforts against the 3rd Infantry Division, which at this point barred their entrance to the fortress. General v. d. Tann had proceeded with his staff to the heights on the north-east of Bazeilles, where a strong body of artillery had already been massed, with their guns laid on Balan and the heights to the north of that place, ready to give a warm recep tion to any advance on the part of the enemy. Seventy-eight guns were concentrated here in position, viz., five batteries of the Reserve Artillery, Schleich's Battery of the Ist Infantry Division, four Prussian batteries of the IV. Corps and three batteries of the 3rd Infantry Division. From the increasing vehemence of the firing, the fighting at Balan seemed to be still undecided. Towards 1 p.m. the 5th Brigade was relieved by the 6th Brigades General v. d. Tann saw that the 3rd Infantry Division could not maintain itself against the masses which the Prussian Guards and XII. Corps were pushing back upon it. He accordingly ordered General Dietl, commanding the ist Brigade, to support the troops engaged at Balan. The 2nd Batn. ist Regt. was directed to advance towards Balan, and at once joined in the fight. Mean while the remaining battalions of the ist Brigade, although they had already been nearly seven hours under fire, were kept on the main road to Balan, ready to march thither. General v. d. Tann then proceeded to the northern outskirts of Bazeilles, and there gave instructions to the Officer Commanding the 4th Brigade to hold the boundary of the place, as well as the park, to the last extremity, but to be ready, should an opportunity occur, to assume \u00ab Commanded by Major-General Schleich, consisting of ist, 2nd, and 3rd Batns. 6th Regt., 2nd and 3rd Batns. 7th Regt. and 8th Batn.

The columns of this division could be seen retreating from the heights near Balan, partly in the direction of Balan, partly towards the valley. The enemy's projectiles already reached the boundary of Bazeilles, and it was evident that he had undertaken an energetic counterstroke with such of his troops as were still able and willing to sight. General v. d. Tann made preparations to parry this blow, as he had parried the blow struck in the forenoon. The battalions of the ist Infantry Brigade, which happened to be at hand, were ordered to advance at once towards Balan. The ist and 2nd Batns. Body Guards advanced on the south of the road, the 2nd Batn. Rifles being kept slightly to the rear in reserve ; north of the road this offensive movement was joined by the 2nd Batn. 13th Regt., 2nd Batn. ioth Regt., ist Batn. 1 2th Regt. and the Rifle Batn. belonging to the IV. Corps. The 2nd Batn. 1st Regt. had previously been ordered to Balan, and had now joined the retreat of the 3rd Infantry Division, with the exception of one company,* which pertinaciously occupied the houses at the south-eastern extremity of the place, although it was fired on by our own artillery. The 7th Batn. Rifles had retired into the gardens to the south. Besides giving support to the 3rd Infantry Division by this offensive movement, General v. d. Tann provided for an immediate attack on the enemy, should he continue his advance and debouch from Balan. The 2nd Brigade received orders to advance from its position in reserve near the railway station of Bazeilles and to take up a position a cheval on the road to Balan. Of this brigade the three Batns. of the 2nd Regt. marched on the south of the road, the 4th Batn. Rifles and ist and 2nd Batns. nth Regt. on the north of it ; the 9th Batn. Rifles occupied the houses in the northern part of Bazeilles. The Cuirassier Brigades had also advanced, and now took up a position in the dip between La Moncelle and Bazeilles. The enemy's attack grew fainter, even before these arrangements of the Officer Commanding the Corps were completed. The artillery posted on the heights had kept up a powerful fire upon * The 8th company, Captain Dietl. f ist and 2nd Cuirassier Regts., 6th Lt. Cavalry Regt."], [100, "The Operations of the I.

Corps, which had advanced towards that place with some detachments of the 3rd Infantry Division and with the Prussian Rifle Batn. (iv. Corps), which General v. d. Tann, as has been already mentioned, had ordered to the front. General Dietl had placed himself at the head of his troops and advanced up to the very gates of Sedan, where he found the white flag floating from the ramparts. Towards 5.30 p.m. the firing gradually ceased. The IV. Corps undertook to furnish the outposts, and the I. Corps received orders to bivouack on the field of battle, which had been gained with heavy losses aster a struggle of nearly fourteen* hours. The ist Infantry Division bivouacked east of Bazeilles ; the 2nd Infantry Division had its 3rd Brigade at La Moncelle, its 4th Brigade on the north-west of Bazeilles. The Reserve Artillery and the Cuirassier Brigade bivouacked further to the rear, between the railway station and the pontoon bridges. General v. d. Tann, with some of the officers of his staff, rode on to the gates of Sedan, just as a superior officer was calling on the fortress to surrender in the name of the Crown Prince of Saxony. \" The commandant has just left the fortress,\" was the naive reply returned from the rampart. The General rode back through Balan, which was partly on fire, and through Bazeilles, which was in full blaze, to Remilly, where he took up his quarters. He had at first intended to stop at La Moncelle, but as it was partly on fire and full of wounded, he decided on Remilly. The I. Corps had been under fire for three consecutive days, and might without conceit be proud of its performances. The losses of the Corps on the 1st of September were very con siderable. They were as follows : \u2014 Killed, 32 officers, 387 men. Wounded, 89 \u201e 1,395 \u201e Missing, \u2014 176 \u201e 121 officers, 1,958 men. * It was about 6 p.m. when the last shots were fired."], [101, "Battle of Sedan. 93 In the three days' fighting the Corps lost 145 officers and 2,513 men. A bloody contribution to the honour of the Bavarian army, an honourable cement to German unity ! The objects which the French leaders had in view during the battle are known from the various works by the French generals in command ; in these pages there is only room to mention the effect of their remarkably divergent plans on the part we took in the battle. According to the writings of French officers of high rank, MacMahon had no regular plan whatever, at least not one of the four French corps received any directions from him on the evening of the 31st of August or during the following night. MacMahon seemed merely to be ready to fight as a brave soldier, in the position in which he found himself against his own convictions. His successor, General Ducrot, had the intention, as is well known, of retreating in the direction of Mezieres and eventually crossing the frontier into Belgium. With this object, he ordered an advance in the direction of Givonne, to endeavour to open a passage for his army. Finally General Wimpfen took the command. His plan was to push through to Carignan, throwing the I. Bavarian Corps against the Meuse, or if possible into it. The immediate conse quence of this plan seems to have been the energetic forward stroke of the enemy between 9 and 10 A.M. In the afternoon General Wimpfen made a final attempt to break through by Bazeilles, and in this attempt the obstinate fight about Balan developed itself, which cost the brave 3rd Infantry Division of the Bavarians such bloody sacrifices. According to the writings of the two French generals, Wimpfen and Ducrot, the latter assumed command of the army about 7.30 A.M., and immediately ordered the ist French Corps to make preparations for the movement towards Mezieres, which has already been mentioned, and in which the first object was to gain and secure the plateau of Illy. General Ducrot in the next instance proceeded about 9 A.M. to General Lebrun, near Bazeilles, and desired him to commence the retreat towards Illy at once with the right wing of his corps.* General Lebrun met this request by stating that a retreat at * The 12th."], [102, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 94 present (about 9 A.M.) was neither necessary nor expedient, as the opposing enemy* was beginning to yield. This was, in fact, at the commencement of that critical hour, during which the Bavarian battalions were too exhausted to push further into Bazeilles, and the 3rd (Bavarian) Brigade was hardly able to maintain itself between La Moncelle and the park, that has been so often mentioned. At last, just as General Lebrun had agreed to begin the retreat and to take the necessary measures for its execution, General Ducrot received a written message from General Wimpfen (at 9 a.m.), that he was in possession of a written decree, signed by the War Minister, appointing him Commander-in-Chief of the army. Generals Ducrot and Lebrun rode off to General Wimp fen, who was at Balan. General Wimpfen objected to General Ducrot's plan and stated his decided intention of assuming the offensive invthe direction of the Bavarians. f With this object, he placed considerable additional supports, belonging to the 7th Corps (Douay), at the disposal of General Lebrun, who believed himself, as has been stated, to be gaining an advantage over the enemy. The plan of voluntarily abandoning the position near Bazeilles had been determined on at 9 a.m., but its execution was interrupted owing to the command being in the meantime transferred to General Wimpfen, who determined to assume the offensive. When the Bavarians made their last exertions between 9.30 and 10 A.M., the Officer Commanding the 12th French Corps, which was opposing them, had already been instructed in the plan of the new French Commander-in-Chief to advance and attack in the direction of Bazeilles. It has been asserted by different writers, especially in non-Ger man military periodicals, that the French voluntarily abandoned Bazeilles and its neighbourhood ; but this assertion is disproved by the simple fact that General Wimpfen had assumed command, and that all thoughts of retreat had therefore been given up, more than an hour before the final and decisive attack by the I. Bavarian Corps and the Saxons. If the enemy between 9 and 10 A.M. did abandon his position at any points in Bazeilles voluntarily, \u2014 i.e., without being forced to do so by the Bavarian soldiers, \u2014 it was merely owing to the flames * The 1. Bavarian Corps. f i. Corps."], [103, "Battle of Sedan. 95 and the suffocating smoke, which prevented the defenders, no less than their assailants, from proceeding with the fight. In conclusion, it may be well to republish here a statement drawn up by General v. d. Tann at the conclusion of peace, in accordance with facts formally established concerning the destruc tion of Bazeilles, which had formed the subject of much talk, and concerning the so-called butchery of the innocent inhabitants of the place, which had grown into a tradition. The statement in question was as follows : \u2014 \" The troops of the I. Bavarian Army Corps and of the Royal Prussian 8th Infantry Division have been upbraided by journals, especially by the Times of September 15th, 1870, through the publication of a letter of the Due de Fitz-James, dated Paris, September 12th, 1870, for using unjustifiable cruelty towards the inhabitants of Bazeilles, during the conflict for the possession of that place on September ist, 1870.\" \" Bavarians and Prussians are said to have set fire to the village, in order to punish the inhabitants for the part they took in its defence. It is said that the Gardes Nationales had for the most part remained in the village, that the inhabitants had fled into the cellars, and that women and children, everybody in fact, had been burnt to death. Of the 2,000 inhabitants, barely 300 were said to have escaped, and these related how the Bavarians had driven whole families back into the flames, and shot down the women who tried to make their escape.\" \" During the war I made no reply to these accusations, as I did not wish to meet them with mere assertions, but with formal proofs of their mendacity. Since the conclusion of peace I have obtained from the French authorities, especially from M. Belle mont, Mayor of Bazeilles, through the obliging medium of the German Civil Commissary, an exhaustive nominal report of all the inhabitants who perished during the conflict of the 31st of August and the ist of September.\" \" According to this official report, the total number of inhabi tants killed, wounded, or missing, is thirty-nine, viz. : \u2014 Burnt or suffocated, \u2014 2 bedridden women, 3 men, 3 children.

Bellemont, adds to the report, that of 2,048 inhabitants, 140 or 150 have since died of diseases entailed by want and misery.\" \" Nancy, the 29th of June, 1871.\" (Signed) \" Freiherr v. d.

Corps was not in possession of exact intelligence concerning the vast importance of the victory and its consequences ; for the Army Corps was at some distance from the King of Prussia's headquarters, where events of the greatest importance in the history of the world were happening. It was only during the night that General v. d. Tann received information from the headquarters of the III. Army, that the enemy had opened negotiations, till the definite termination of which hostilities were not to be recommenced. The firing from the batteries posted on the heights near Frenois was to be the signal in case hostilities were to be resumed. During the forenoon of the 2nd of September it became known that the army and fortress had capitulated, and that the Emperor Napoleon had been made prisoner. It is impossible to describe the impression created by this news. Those who were lucky enough to be present on that day, and to survive the next four months, will never forget how the news, that the French army had laid down its arms, spread like wildfire through the bivouacks, and how endless were the ringing cheers for the King of Bavaria, the Crown Prince of Prussia, and our generals. His Majesty the King of Prussia assigned to the XI. and I. Corps and to the 4th Cavalry Division, the duty of superintend ing the whole capitulation, and of transporting the prisoners of war to Germany. 11"], [106, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 98 The French army laid down its arms in Sedan on the morn ing of the 3rd of September, and began to move out of the fortress on to a peninsula north-west of Sedan, formed by a large bend of the Meuse to the north. The XI. Corps and the 4th Cavalry Division guarded this spot, on which the prisoners were collected, from the heights on the right bank of the Meuse, while the I. Corps had to close the peninsula on the southern side, between Glaire and Villette. The period from the 3rd to the nth of September was very trying to the I. Corps, and produced effects that were felt for a considerable time. The following were the duties which it had to perform : \u2014 Guarding the prisoners. Transporting the prisoners. Clearing the battle-field. Collecting and sorting the enormous quantity of captured war mate'riel. The XL Corps, Lieutenant-General v. Schachtmayer, was placed under the orders. of General v. d. Tann, but the 4th Cavalry Division only received orders to place itself in communication with the latter General. At noon on the 3rd of September the ist and 2nd Infantry Divisions moved from their bivouacks on the battle-field of Bazeilles across the railway bridge to Torcy, Glaire and Villette. From these places they occupied in force the canal, which closes the peninsula on the south, and the glacis of the fortress of Sedan, across which the captive army moved in an uninterrupted stream during thirty-six hours. The Reserve Artillery took up very confined bivouacks and cantonments about Wadelincourt ; the Cuirassier Brigade remained at Balan. With regard to the transport of prisoners, the headquarter (King of Prussia's) staff had decided that five detachments, each of 2,000 prisoners, were to be despatched daily, at intervals of half an hour, the first detachment starting at 6 A.M. Each detachment was to be escorted by two companies of infantry and half a squadron of cavalry. This movement was to begin on the 5th of September, on which day the I. Corps was to provide the escort. In the meantime the prisoners were divided according to their"], [107, "Sedan. \u2014 TJie March towards Paris. 99 Corps (ist, 5th, 7th, and I2th) by four commissions formed for this purpose. Of the I. Corps, the ist Infantry Division had to furnish the prisoners' escort on the 5th of September, and the Corps was ordered to furnish the escort every alternate day, taken from each of the two Infantry Divisions in turn. One of the most pressing matters after the capitulation was the care of providing food for the prisoners of war, about 100,000 in number. The French army was literally exposed to the risk of starvation, owing to the utter want of any kind of provisions in the fortress of Sedan. The danger was the greater, as the men were already exhausted by the fighting and the heavy marches. The German stores were hardly able to supply their own troops, and means of transport were wanting to collect supplies in the part of the country under occupation ; the railway to Montmedy had been destroyed by the French, and was therefore not at once available for that object. As early as the 3rd of September General v. d. Tann had ordered the commissariat detachments to come up as quickly as possible from Sommauthe, but they were hardly able, as has been stated, to supply their own troops. In the night between the 3rd and 4th of September the Aide de-camp of the Commandant of Mezieres arrived at General v. d. Tann's headquarters at Petit Torcy, to negotiate concerning the subsistence of the prisoners of war. The Commandant of the fortress of Mezieres undertook to supply the necessary provisions, in consideration of which the Germans agreed not to undertake hostilities in the meantime.* The French Commandant fulfilled his agreement most loyally. On the next day the first transport of 100,000 rations was sent by railway as far as the ruined bridge of Donchery, whence it was conveyed on carriages to the peninsula. On the 4th of September wet weather set in, and lasted with but short intervals during the whole time the I. Corps remained before Sedan. The troops for the most part bivouacked in the * Mezieres was of importance owing to its commanding the railway line to Rheims ; but as this line could not be used until the railway bridge at Donchery was rebuilt, which would take from three to four weeks at least, the agreement as to the fortress of Mezieres entailed no military disadvantage, while it certainly saved the 100,000 prisoners from literal starvation. H 2"], [108, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 100 Meuse valley, which soon became a mere swamp, and as the duty of guarding the prisoners, clearing the battle-field, and collecting and sorting the war materiel was very trying, the continued wet weather caused considerable suffering. The effluvium rising from the corpses and carcases, which were either half buried or not buried at all, filled the air with a most repulsive odour, while the water used by the troops for cooking was nearly poisoned by the corpses and filth of every description. These great but unavoid able evils, attending the detention of the I. Corps before Sedan, laid the foundation of many illnesses which afterwards broke out. On the 6th of September the detachments were moved into con fined cantonments in the nearest villages, in order somewhat to spare them. Only those detachments which were on guard over the prisoners had to bivouack. To remedy the want of provisions which was gradually being felt, requisitioning parties were sent to considerable distances, and the railway from Sedan to Carignan was ordered to be re-established by the 2nd Company of Field Engineers. The locomotives belonging to this line were found in a useless condition at Bazeilles, but they were soon repaired, owing to the remarkable industry of some young mechanics belonging to the detachment of volunteer hospital attendants, and the traffic was re-established on the part of the line between Sedan and Carignan. The total railway materiel taken consisted of 5 locomotives, 5 tenders, 106 covered goods trucks, 61 open goods trucks, 76 low open trucks. The supply of provisions by this line of railway was but small, as the places in the narrow strip of country between the Meuse and the Belgian frontier had very little to offer. In the meantime the transport of the captive army continued without interruption. Two Etappe lines had been decided on for this purpose. One by Buzancy, Clermont, St. Mihiel and Pont-a Mousson ; the other by Stenay, Damvillers, Etain and Remilly. The relief of the escorts at the termini of Pdnt-a-Mousson and Remilly could not always be effected at the right time, so that some of these escorts had to accompany their prisoners far into Germany. For the continuation of the march to Paris, orders had been issued from the headquarters of the German army for the XL and"], [109, "Sedan. \u2014 The March towards Paris. 101 i. Corps to follow the main army by Rethel and Rheims, and by Attigny and Epernay, respectively. The mass of prisoners gradually diminished, 10,000 being marched off daily. Of the captured horses, such as were serviceable were selected and divided into large trains, to be sent after the army ; the unserviceable were shot. The war materiel was at last collected and sorted, and after a week's exertions the material harvest of the victory of Sedan may thus be said to have been gathered in. At noon on the nth of September the XI. and I. Corps lest the neighbourhood of Sedan. The numbers of the Infantry of the I. Corps had been con siderably reduced by losses, and by its having despatched about twenty escorts to prisoners. The constitution of some of the tactical units was in consequence almost dissolved ; for instance, of the 13th Regiment only one subdivision was present, while of the 2nd Regiment there were only the last arrived Ersatz reserves, which were formed into one company. Twenty-six companies and a half had been detached from the Ist Infantry Division, and thirty companies and three-quarters from the 2nd Infantry Division, so that the strength of the Infantry of the I. Corps on marching from Sedan was only forty-two companies and three-quarters, or somewhat over ten battalions. To ease the troops, the march was carried out in several columns and till further orders as a march in time of peace. The headquarters of the Corps were September nth at Le Chene, 12th at Attigny, 13th at Juniville, 14th at Beine, and on the 15th were moved to Epernay, in the neighbourhood of which town the I. Corps halted for the 16th of September as a day of rest. On the 17th the Corps marched to Orbais, and on the 18th of September to Viels-Maisons. The 6th Lt. Cavalry Regiment, hitherto attached to the Cuiras sier Brigade, was ordered by the King of Prussia's headquarter staff to march into Alsace, where it was left for the remainder of the war under the orders of the governor of that province. The Corps continued its march on the 19th of September to Coulommiers, where it received an order from the headquarters of the in. Army to send a detachment of three battalions, two batteries, and one squadron, on the 20th of September, via Melun to Fontainebleau, for the purpose of dispersing the bands of"], [110, "The Operations of the i.

A large number of trenches across the road, which were mostly useless and easily avoided, showed that the rayon of the defence of Paris was being approached. The stone bridge at Corbeil, which the French had blown up, had already been replaced by a wooden one, by which the Corps crossed the Seine on the 21st of September. In accordance with an order from the headquarters of the III.

Some of the escorts to prisoners had rejoined, and the strength of the Corps was 16 battalions, 16 squadrons, and 96 guns. The duty assigned to it was to form a reserve to the troops * investing Paris on the south side, and to cover them against any attack from the direction of Orleans and Tours. No trustworthy information could be obtained as to the numbers of the enemy's forces, which were being formed into an army of relief on the Loire. French accounts spoke of a fresh and power ful army in process of formation from troops drawn from Algiers and the numerous depots of the South, which would soon be ready to take the field. Other accounts, received chiefly through Eng land and Belgium, scarcely ascribed any vitality at all to this Army of the Loire. The truth lay between the two accounts, as was shown by later .events. Orders had been issued from the headquarters of the German army for four cavalry divisions (2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th) to search the country on the south and south-west of Paris as far as possible in the direction of the Loire, and to make requisitions on a large scale for the purpose of supplying the German armies. To the south the country is open and adapted for cavalry, so that the divisions in question had already swept the country to Pithiviers and towards Artenay ; but to the west and south-west their action had been greatly limited by large woods.

Bavarian Army Corps. 104 they are always in want of one tactical quality, viz., the power of acting on the defensive, and thereby securing and keeping what they take. The boldest horsemen are unable to take or hold villages or woods in the face of any serious attempt at defence, so that single bands of Franc-tireurs or armed peasants can delay and seriously impede bodies of cavalry in their reconnoitring duties when unsupported by infantry. The assistance of infantry is often necessary in the practical work of requisitioning. The inhabi tants, of course, complied most unwillingly with the demands of the requisitioning parties. Even when the necessary supplies were discovered, by what may be called the incomparable instinct of the Prussian horsemen, and were collected, it was often no easy task for cavalry to march off in safety from a large village in the midst of an excited population ; especially as the supplies had to be conveyed on carriages, also requisitioned, which were driven by most unwilling drivers. One subdivision of infantry was more effective on such occasions than one or even two squadrons of cavalry. These were probably the considerations which induced the Commander-in-Chief (King of Prussia) to order infantry to be attached to each of the four cavalry divisions. This infantry was to be taken from the I. Corps, and in accordance with this order the following battalions were to march to join the respective cavalry divisions on the 29th of September : \u2014 ist and 3rd Batn. 2nd Regt* to the 5th Cav.

The three battalions of Body Guards had just returned (Sep tember 28th) from the expedition to Melun and Fontainebleau, and had rejoined the I. Corps.

Now that there had been a few days of comparative quiet in the cantonments round Longjumeau, the pernicious consequences of the unhealthy deten tion before Sedan began to make themselves seriously felt. Typhus and dysentery were the prevailing illnesses ; according to the unanimous opinion of the doctors they were chiefly contracted in the trying duties after the battle of Sedan, when the troops had to pass days and nights in swampy bivouacks, under an incessant downpour of rain, and breathing air tainted by the exhalations of putrefaction. At 4 A.M., September 29th, the alarm was given to the Corps * and the 4th Brigade was reinforced, as has been mentioned, by the 1 2th Regt. (ist and 2nd Batns.), and later on by two squadrons of the 4th Lt. Cavalry Regiment and a battery of 6-pounders, which were sent towards Petit Bicetre. After a detachment had been left at Arpajon, there appeared at the alarm post on the north of Longjumeau only four and a half battalions of the 1st Infantry Division and two and a half of the 2nd Infantry Division. In addition to the Ersatz reserve, the Bavarian war ministry had, with a view to completing and reinforcing the I. Corps, despatched two battalions -f- armed with Werder rifles, which had till now garrisoned Ulm and Ingolstadt, as well as a newly-formed Artillery Division, consisting of two 6-pounder batteries (Malaise and Olivier), two 12-pounder batteries (Mayr and Ebnerj) and one mitrailleuse battery (Thurheim). These most welcome rein forcements arrived in part while the Corps was still about Long jumeau (3rd Batn. 1 2th Regt. on October 3rd, 3rd Batn. 13th Regt. on October 5th, Olivier's 6-pounder Battery on October 3rd, Thurheim's Battery on October 4th). On the 5 th of October the Corps was rejoined by the 2nd Batn. 3 rd Regt., which had been detached since the march from Bar-le- Duc (August the 26th), and used by the Etappe authorities to secure the Etappe lines of communication against Franc-tireurs and refractory inhabitants.

On the 4th of October the I. Corps occupied the following general position: \u2014 ist Brigade Arpajon, 2nd Brigade Montlhery, 3rd Brigade Longjumeau, 4th Brigade Palaiseau, Cuirassier Brigade Orsay, Reserve Artillery between Montlhery and Longjumeau, the Division of Field Engineers* Essonnes. On the 5th of October reports and intelligence arrived in rapid succession, from which an immediate and serious advance of the hostile forces composing the so-called Loire Army appeared pro bable. On the 4th of October the 15 th Cavalry Brigade (6th Cav. Div.), in conjunction with two companies of the ist Batn. nth Regt., had already come into collision with about 1,400 Gardes Mobiles near Eperon, had taken the place and driven the enemy away after some loss. On the 5th of October, at Toury, two Cavalry Brigades of the 4th Cavalry Division and the 2nd Batn. Body Guards observed the enemy in considerable force, viz., from six to eight battalions of the Line, three cavalry regiments, and a few batteries. As soon as the strength of the enemy had been accurately determined, the division, commanded by Prince Albrecht (senior), withdrew slowly towards Angerville without being pursued ; the infantry (2nd Batn. Body Guards) marched on the road and was flanked on either side by the cavalry. The detachment, pushed forward by the 4th Cavalry Division to Pithiviers, of which the 1st Batn. Body Guards formed part, was alarmed by the advance of the enemy, and took up a position on the south of the village. Towards evening it retired through Pithiviers to Etampes, in accordance with orders from superior authority. In this movement a considerable number of oxen, the result of a requisitioning expedition of several days' duration, had unfortunately to be left behind. On the afternoon of October 5 th, an orderly arrived at Arpajon with the news of the collision which had taken place near Toury that morning. The news was at once telegraphed to the corps * The Division of Field Engineers consisted at this time only of the 3rd company of Field Engineers with three pontoon carriages; the 1st and 2nd companies had been attached to the 11.

The troops at Arpajon were held in readiness to march. In the early morning of the 6th of October, Lieutenant-General v. Blumenthal informed the Officer Commanding the I. Corps, that, from intelligence received, the enemy appeared to be ad vancing in considerable force from the south ; it was added, that there were also signs of a sortie from Paris. It was lest to General v. d. Tann to act in conformity with these circumstances, without further directions or instructions. According to the report from the 4th Cavalry Division, the enemy was near Toury on the morning of October 5th, and it might therefore be presumed that he would have advanced as far as Angerville by the evening of that day. The distance from Angerville to Arpajon is ten hours (30 Eng lish miles). It was therefore not expected that our troops at Arpajon would be attacked by the enemy on the 6th of October, but they had to be kept together in view of a possible sortie on that day. The Officer Commanding the Corps accordingly placed the troops in echelon, on the line from Longjumeau to Arpajon. The 2nd Infantry Division was the stronger of the two ; it was on that account to be placed nearer to Paris, as the attack was more likely to come from that direction. The ist Infantry Division appeared sufficiently strong, if posted near Arpajon, in conjunction with the Cuirassier Brigade, to support the 4th Cavalry Division, should it retire so far. The ist Infantry Division was accordingly ordered to concen trate all its available forces near Arpajon. The 4th Brigade marched to Montlhery, while the 3rd Brigade remained at Long jumeau. The Reserve Artillery also remained in its quarters. The Cuirassier Brigade was sent to the left flank of the troops facing south, to act in the more open country round Bretigny. These dispositions made it possible, in case of a sortie from Paris, at once to make use of the 3rd Brigade (consisting of 7 battalions, 2 squadrons, a 4-pounder battery, and the two 6-pounder batteries belonging to the 2nd Infantry Division), while two hours later the 4th Brigade and the Reserve Artillery could be brought up from the neighbourhood of Montlhery to the north of Longjumeau. The I. Corps was thus in a position to bring up 14 battalions,"], [116, "108 The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 1 1 batteries, and 3 squadrons within three hours, to fulfil one of the two duties assigned to it, viz., that of acting as a reserve to the troops investing Paris on the south. This would, however, have been a difficult task, had an attack from the south been made near Arpajon simultaneously with a sortie from Paris ; for at Arpajon there were only the ist Infantry Division and the Cuirassier Brigade, the former consisting of 6 battalions (9 battalions, if the Body Guards should rejoin the Division), 5 batteries, and 4 squadrons, the latter consisting of 8 squadrons and 2 * batteries of Horse Artillery. By 10 a.m. a telegram from the II. Corps announced that no movement was apparent in the forts or garrison of Paris. A sortie was no longer to be expected on that day. At noon an order arrived from the headquarters of the III. Army for the whole of the I. Corps to concentrate on that day (Octo ber 6) in a position near Arpajon. The 22nd Prussian Division, under Lieutenant-General v. Wittich, was placed as a reserve under the command of the I. Corps, and received a direct order to move to Montlhery. The 4th Cavalry Division was to retire, if pressed by superior forces, by Boissy and Egly on the position near Arpajon, while the 2nd Cavalry Division was to advance from the neighbourhood of Epinay in the direction of Marolles (south east of Arpajon), to cover the left flank of the I. Corps. In accordance with these directions from the headquarters of the III. Army, the 1st Infantry Division was ordered to concen trate near Arpajon and St. Germain, the 3rd Brigade was directed on Ollainville, the 4th Brigade on Bruyeres-le-Chatel. The Re serve Artillery was ordered to concentrate in confined cantonments and bivouacks near Leuville, the Cuirassier Brigade was to take up the cantonments, as directed, about Bretigny. The troops belonging to the 2nd Infantry Division reached their various desti nations late in the evening, and had for the most part to bivouack. The 3rd Brigade pushed three battalions f southward to Egly, while the ist Brigade placed the 2nd Batn. Rifles, two guns and half a troop of Lt. Horse, still further to the south, in Etrechy.

The 22nd Division had arrived at nightfall in Montlhery, and had taken up confined cantonments there and in the immediate neighbourhood. General v. d. Tann's intention was to await the enemy in a posi tion stretching from Bruyeres by Arpajon to St. Germain, and if possible to let him begin the attack, in which his probable superiority in artillery would not avail him much, and then to assume the offensive with one or both wings, according to circum stances. A stream called the Orge flows from south-west to north-east, passing the western boundary of Arpajon, where it is joined by another stream, the Celle, flowing direct from the west. In front of the right of this position, between Bruyeres and Arpajon, there were thus two streams of considerable depth, which an attacking force could only wade through at a few points. If our left wing had been posted along the left bank of the Orge, to the east of Arpajon, a sharp salient angle would have been formed in the position. This did not appear desirable, and it was there fore intended, in case the enemy should attack, to move the posi tion of the left wing to the right bank of the Orge, and to give this wing a strong point of support by occupying the Castle of La Norville and the walled park adjoining it. From this part of the position the enemy's advance against the other parts could be powerfully taken in flank. The scheme had also the advantage of enabling the cavalry (2nd Cav. Div. and Cuiraisser Brigade) to remain in a secure position north of La Bretonniere, from which it could readily issue. The heights between Bruyeres and Arpajon command the plateau on which lie the villages of Egly, Boissy and Arrainville, so that our artillery posted on them could effectually pound the enemy during his advance. On the morning of the 7th of October General v. d. Tann, accompanied by Lieutenant-General v. Wittich, rode over the position and the surrounding country. No reports indicating the enemy's approach arrived from the 4th Cavalry Division, which was to the south ; the troops therefore remained in their canton ments and bivouacks."], [118, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 110 The 4th Cavalry Division had applied to the Officer Commanding the ist Infantry Division on the evening of the 6th of October to send as strong a force of infantry as possible on to Etampes, and the same application was now made to General v. d. Tann. The instructions from Versailles expressly stated that \" the 4th Cavalry Division was to retire, if pressed by superior forces, by Boissy and Egly ; \" but, irrespective of these instructions, it did not appear expedient to disperse the forces, already far from considerable, for the sake of attempting to gain small advantages. There were only two sound courses that could be adopted, viz., either to seek the Army of the Loire with all the troops available and thoroughly to beat it, or to remain purely on the defensive, keeping a certain space to the south of the investing army free from the enemy's approach. Small engagements, if successful, could produce no decisive results ; if unsuccessful, would strengthen the enemy both morally and physically. These were the motives which induced General v. d. Tann not to accede to the request of the 4th Cavalry Division, and in his refusal to quote the above-mentioned passage in the orders from Versailles. The advance guard of the ist Infantry Division was brought in from Etrechy, which is three hours (9 English miles) from Arpajon, and posted at Boissy to remain purely in observation. The 2nd Cavalry Division (Lieut-General v. Stolberg) reached the neighbourhood of Marolles in the evening ; the 4th Cavalry Division with the ist and 2nd Batns. Body Guards were still at Etampes. Only at Versailles was it possible to judge whether a further advance to the south would be opportune and expedient. Lieu tenant-Colonel v. Brandenstein, of the headquarter staff, had made himself acquainted during the day with the state of affairs at Arpajon, and had returned towards evening to Versailles, whence an order arrived by telegraph in the night, between the 7th and 8th of October, to the following effect : \u2014 \" General v. d. Tann will advance to-morrow, October 8th, with his whole Army to Etampes.\" On the 8th of October, when the advance to the south began, nobody suspected that this was the commencement of a long and bloody chapter in the war, in fact, the opening of a fresh campaign.

Bavarian Army Corps. 114 (including the 5,000 bayonets of the 22nd Infantry Division) a total number of about 21,000 bayonets and 6,700 sabres. This peculiar proportion in the numbers of the two arms had great influence on the operations which followed, and became of great importance in the advance to Bourges in the middle of October. The main strength of the Germans lay in the supe riority of their cavalry and artillery. They had 8 guns per 1,000 bayonets. The nature of the ground on which the approaching operations were to take place was thoroughly adapted for the use of cavalry and artillery, in case the enemy should make any stand. As soon as the order arrived for the advance to Etampes, General v. d. Tann issued the following directions : \u2014 The Advance Guard (consisting of the 2nd Batn. Rifles, 2nd Batn. ist Regt., Schleich's Battery of 6-pounders, and two squadrons of the 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt.), under Major-General Dietl, will start at 6.15 A.M. and march to Bel Aix. The remainder of the 1st Infantry Division will follow at 7 A.M., and take up cantonments in the northern part of Etampes. The 2nd Infantry Division will march at 8.30 A.M.; the 3rd Brigade will march in front and take up confined cantonments in the southern part of Etampes, while the 4th Brigade will move to Chalo-St.-Mars and St. Hilaire. The Reserve Artillery will follow the Infantry, two Divisions marching in rear of the ist Infantry Division to Brieres and Boissy-le-Sec, and two Divisions in rear of the 2nd Infantry Division to La Foret-le-Roi and Boissy-le-Sec. The Cuirassier Brigade will march at 11.30 A.M. by Dourdan to Authon, covering the right flank of the columns and endeavouring to establish communications with the 6th Cavalry Division. The 22nd Division will march at noon to Etrechy and its imme diate neighbourhood. The object in these instructions was to occupy the ground between St. Hilaire and Etampes. As nothing accurate was known of the enemy's disposition and strength, an offensive movement on his part might still be expected. He was in that case to be received near Etampes in the manner laid down for his reception near Arpajon. A request had been sent to the 2nd Cavalry Division to move towards Marolles (to the south-west of Etampes), to cover the left flank of the corps."], [123, "The Advance towards the Loire. 115 During the march, news arrived from the 15th Cavalry Brigade, which belonged to the 6th Cavalry Division, that a squadron of Hussars and a company of Bavarians had been surprised during the night in the village of Ablis, three hours (9 English miles) north-west of Authon, by Franc-tireurs and Gardes Mobiles, who certainly had some secret understanding with the inhabitants. The losses had been considerable, especially those of the Hussars. In consequence of this report the Cuirassier Brigade, which was on the extreme right flank in Authon, was ordered to keep most strictly on the alert. The troops moved into their quarters and bivouacks in the afternoon. The 4th Cavalry Division had its ioth Cavalry Brigade in Etampes. The- 8th Cavalry Brigade was in St. Hilaire and Chalo- St-Mars, but had detached four squadrons on outpost duty to the front, and two squadrons as flank patrols to Marolles, to watch the country towards Pithiviers and Malesherbes. The 9th Cavalry Brigade was cantoned in Authon, Boissy-le-Sec, and Boutervilliers. Two valleys, almost defiles, join at a point a few thousand paces south of Etampes. They are very deep, and have the appearance of clefts in the level plain of the Beauce. The shorter valley begins at Grandeville-Gaudreville, and runs in a direction parallel to the road from Etampes to Angerville, by Chalo-Moulineux to Chalo-St.-Mars, and thence due east' to Etampes. The other valley is much more important, and is formed by three minor valleys, which run from Allainville, Ser maises, and Angerville to Saclas, where they unite and form a deeply-cut main valley, running by Boissy-la-Riviere and Ormoy la-Riviere towards Etampes, on the east of the high road. There are numerous villages and mills in these valleys. The slopes of the sides are at places very steep, and for the most part thickly planted, and only practicable for infantry, but roads lead up through small gullies at several points. The last-mentioned valley stretches almost from Toury, and affords a covered approach to Etampes. Movements of troops in the valley can only be observed from the crest of the sides. Our Army came upon the head of the \" Army of the Loire \" in these ravines, which were singularly adapted to the use of Franc tireurs and untrained troops, who naturally object to an open field of battle. I 2"], [124, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 116 The first report came from a detachment of the 8th Cavalry Bri gade at Marolles, to the effect that its patrols had been heavily fired upon from Fontaine-la-Riviere (east of Saclas). Soon afterwards, Major-General Dietl reported, that small bodies of the enemy had from time to time been moving along the railway embankment and had opened a skirmishing fire on our outposts, and that our patrols had been fired on from Saclas. The right wing of the outposts, consisting of Prussian Cavalry (8th Cavalry Brigade), had occupied Chemery, and reported that the enemy had for a time occupied a farm (Chicheny) in front of Chemery, but that he had already been driven out of it. A report reached the advance guard that the enemy had been seen in force in the valley near Saclas, whereupon the 2nd Batn. ist Regt. was detached to that place for the night. A further reconnaissance, however, proved this report to be erroneous. With the object of barring the defiles that led to the flanks of our position, the 3 rd Brigade received an order in the afternoon to occupy Ormoy-la-Riviere with a strong guard, while the 4th Brigade was ordered to bar the defile on the west of the road by occupying Boinville. During the afternoon a small engagement had taken place near Fontaine-la-Riviere. The two squadrons of the 8th Cavalry Brigade, which have already been mentioned, retired towards Boissy-la-Riviere, where they joined a detachment under the command of Lieut. -Col. v. Goltz, consisting of one batn. of the 27th Prussian Landwehr Regt. and two squadrons of Dragoons. This detachment had lest Corbeil on the 6th of October to support the 4th Cavalry Division, and had arrived that day in the neighbourhood of Etampes. The Landwehr, supported by the two Horse Artillery Batteries of the 2nd Cavalry Division which had just reached the neighbourhood of Marolles, at once engaged the enemy's infantry, about 500 or 600 strong. The enemy was easily and quickly driven out of Fontaine-la-Riviere, and hastily retired in the direction of Sermaises. The prisoners taken in this action stated that there were about 10,000 men of all arms at Pithiviers and Malesherbes, under the command of General La Motterouge. This report was afterwards verified. It would seem, therefore, that as early as October the enemy had conceived the plan, which he attempted to execute with considerable forces in December, of advancing by Fontainebleau and Melun simultaneously with a sortie from Paris."], [125, "The Advance towards the Loire. 117 It had been resolved at Versailles that General v. d. Tann's Army should advance towards Orleans and drive the enemy beyond the Loire. On the 8th of October, during the afternoon, an order to this effect arrived at Etampes. The Army was to continue its advance towards Orleans, flanked on either side by the 2nd and 4th Cavalry Divisions, and eventually to pursue the enemy in the direction of Tours. According to the intelligence received during the 8th of October, the enemy's forces in our immediate front were comparatively small, and merely employed in reconnoitring our position from the valleys and defiles before us. They probably formed the advanced parties of a considerable force which was at Toury or Artenay. It was our intention on the following day to attack these ad vanced detachments of the enemy in their hiding places, and to send our cavalry round to take them in rear. The Army was therefore to advance concentrically on Angerville, and the follow ing orders were issued : \u2014 The advance guard will march at 6.30 A.M., and advance as quickly as possible to Barmainville. The remainder of the ist Infantry Division will follow the advance guard at 7 A.M. to Angerville, keeping abreast of the columns marching on either side. The Reserve Artillery will immediately follow the ist Infantry Division. The 4th Brigade (2nd Inf. Div.) will march at 7 A.M. through the valleys and on the neighbouring heights of Chalo-St.-Mars, by Chalo-Moulineux, Pussay, and Dommerville to a point abreast of Barmainville, driving everything before it. The 3rd Brigade (2nd Inf. Div.) will march at 6.30 A.M. from Etampes, through the valleys and on the neighbouring heights, by Ormoy-la-Riviere to Boissy-la-Riviere, where it will divide into three columns and move by Panecieres, Mereville, and Angerville to points abreast of Barmainville. The 4th Cav. Div., with the Cuirassier Brigade attached to it, will march at 6 A.M. through the line of outposts by Vierville towards Janville, leaving the valleys on the left. It will advance at a rapid trot and take up a position fronting Angerville, ready to attack the enemy's infantry during its retreat. The 2nd Cav. Div. will pass through the line of outposts near"], [126, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 118 Marolles at 6 A.M. and, leaving the valleys on the right, will advance at a trot by Audeville towards Outerville, where it will similarly take up a position fronting Angerville, ready to intercept the enemy's infantry during its retreat. The 22nd Inf. Div. will follow in reserve at 7 A.M. along the road to Orleans. These dispositions provided on the one hand for a general attack on the enemy's detachments in the defiles and to the north of Angerville, while on the other hand the Army would be in a good formation for overcoming any real resistance. The co-operation of the two Cavalry Divisions, advanced on either flank, would materially influence the result of an important engagement. The night between the 8th and 9th of October passed in quiet, The weather was cold and raw. France in autumn did not seem to be much milder than Germany. Late in the evening a report arrived from the 6th Cavalry Division, that Ablis was no longer occupied by it, but had been set on fire. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first instance in this war of a whole village being burnt to the ground on account of treachery on the part of its inhabitants. The measure was severe but necessary. As long as a war is confined to regular troops alone, it is carried on in a civilised manner, but as soon as the population with its rude hatred and its passions interferes with the sanguinary task of soldiers, it is necessary to demand an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Every war between races. \u2014 and the war with France became a war between races after the catastrophe of Sedan \u2014 produces deeds of treacherous murder and refined cruelty, which are the inevitable consequences of attempts to excite resistance and hatred on the one hand, and on the other hand of the necessary precautions against the passionate outbursts of patriotic feeling. How the Bavarians were concerned in the burning of Ablis we cannot say, but according to a tradition peculiar to France, the Bavarian is always represented as the incendiary par excellence. Just as the conventional \"Ulan\" invariably appears in French pic tures with a struggling little child, which he is about to devour or otherwise destroy, the \" Bavarois\" is always seen with a firebrand in his outstretched hand. The origin of this addition to the accoutrements of a Bavarian probably lies in the mythical de-"], [127, "The Advance towards the Loire. 119 struction of Bazeilles. During the whole campaign not a single village was summarily set on fire by the I. Corps, not even villages from which shots were fired. Fires resulting from a struggle for a farm or a village do not come under the heading of wilful incendiarism. We repeat, that it was a severe but necessary reprisal to burn those villages in which the troops had suffered through the treachery or active opposition of the inhabitants. The 4th Cavalry Division was forced to treat the village of Varize in that manner (Oct. 15 th), but the I. Corps never had occasion to make so harsh an example of any place, and its soldiers did not earn the nick name applied to the Bavarians by the French, nor is it likely that the 11. Corps burnt houses and villages, which afforded them shelter, out of pure love of destruction.* On the 9th of October the Army began its advance in the morning according to orders. The day was cold and gloomy. General v. d. Tann and his staff rode at the head of the ist Infantry Division. The march was carried out without any inci dent of importance, and neither of the columns on the flanks reported that it had met with any resistance worthy of notice. The advance guard (consisting of the 2nd Batn. Rifles, 2y\u00b1 Batns. Body Guards, 2 squadrons, and 2 guns) had reached a point on the high road south of Monnerville, when it was fired into from a farm lying to the west of the road. At the same moment about a dozen Franc-tireurs, who were moving towards Angerville, showed themselves on the crest of a spur on the west of the road. One company of the 2nd Batn. Rifles, which formed the advanced party, at once moved against the farm, where it made prisoners of about 20 Franc-tireurs. Another company extended on the left of the road and advanced against a body of the enemy there, but the light cavalry had already reached this detachment of the enemy, cutting some down and taking others prisoners. The prisoners belonged to a company of Franc-tireurs raised in the South of France, and wore black uni forms with red sashes and large Calabrian hats. Their ages ranged from 17 to 40, and the youngest of them, a * To be candid, it should be mentioned that the Bavarians did not extinguish burning houses, although they did not wilfully set them on fire. Many places, in which a few houses caught fire from shells or by chance, might have been saved, but a soldier only looked for shelter, and if the flames approached the house in which he was quartered, he merely moved on to another one."], [128, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 120 small weak boy, told us with sobs that he had been taken from the \" Gymnase \" and forced to join the company. An officer bear ing a legal commission as such was among the prisoners, but even he knew nothing of the strength and position of the enemy. The only intelligence they could give was, that they were pushed to the front without any information as to the state of affairs. The advance guard, after this encounter, continued its march towards Angerville, from the outskirts of which place a few shots were fired at the leading files. The two guns of the advance guard threw a few shells against the northern entrance, while the 2nd Batn. Rifles rapidly pushed in on the east. With the exception of a few Franc-tireurs, nothing was seen of the enemy. The march of the remaining columns was carried out without any hindrance whatever. On the extreme right flank the 4th Cavalry Division and the Cuirassier Brigade were concentrated on the road from Authon to Angerville, abreast of the village of Merobert. The 9th Cavalry Brigade with one battery formed the advance guard, the ioth Cavalry Brigade and the Cuirassier Brigade the main body, while the 8th Cavalry Brigade, after draw ing in the outposts, formed the reserve. At noon the advance guard reached Janville and occupied the road from Toury to Angerville. The main body meanwhile had advanced as far as Neuvy-en-Beauce. The 4th Brigade at the same time (noon) reached a point abreast of Angerville. The 2nd Cavalry Division, on the left flank, had moved by Audeville to Outarville, a distance of somewhat more than 8 hours (24 English miles) in 3 hours. This Division had started at 6.30 A.M. and was drawn up by 10 A.M. at Outarville, fronting towards Anger ville, but did not capture any of the retreating enemy. The 3rd Brigade formed three columns at Saclas, according to orders. The right column (Lieut.-Col. Schmidt) consisted of the ist Batn. Rifles and ist Batn. 3rd Regt, the centre column (Brigadier-Colonel Roth), of the ist, 2nd and 3rd Batns. 12th Regt. and Metz' 6-pounder Battery, the lest column (Colonel Schuch) of the 2nd and 3rd Batns. 3rd Regt. and Stadelmann's 4-pounder Battery. At Mereville the centre column came upon a small band of Franc-tireurs, which it quickly dispersed. The Officer Com manding the 3rd Brigade imposed a fine of 20,000 francs on the village of Mereville for abetting the Franc-tireurs."], [129, "The Advance towards the Loire. 121 As soon as Angerville was occupied, the Chief of the Staff (Lieut.-Col. v. Heinleth) hurried thither to arrange the distribution of the troops. The ist Brigade was quartered in Arbouville and Armonville, the 2nd Batn. ist Regt in Rouvray-St.-Denis, as escort to part of the Reserve Artillery. The advance guard (ist Batn. ist Regt., 2nd and 3rd squadrons 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. and 2 guns), which had been furnished by this Brigade, was to take up bivouacks and can tonments at Bel Aix, on the road to Toury. The 2nd Brigade was quartered in St. Peravy, Oinville, St. Lip hard, and Boisseaux. This Brigade thus became the advance guard, and had to take the necessary precautionary measures. The 3rd Brigade was quartered in Mereville, Autruy, and Allain ville. The 4th Brigade in Beaudreville, Gonnerville, and Meronville. The Reserve Artillery in Rouvray-St.-Denis and Intreville. The Cuirassier Brigade in Meronville and Levesville-la-Chenard. The 22nd Division in Outarville and its immediate neighbour hood. The 2nd Cavalry Division in Fresnay-l'Eveque, Neuvy-en- Beauce and Janville. General v. d. Tann intended to take up his quarters at the Castle of Arbouville, but this castle only existed on the map, and the headquarters were therefore established at Angerville. On this day the Army entered La Beauce. The boundary of La Beauce, which district the French love to call \"Le Grenier de la France,\" passes through the following points : \u2014 Etampes, Pithiviers, Artenay, Beaugency, Chateaudun, and Chartres. The whole of this tract of country is a plain, inter sected by a few deep ravines, forming the beds of small streams. Here and there are small chains of heights with easy slopes. From a military point of view such a country is well adapted to the use of cavalry and artillery, but these open plains are unfa vourable to infantry, which may have to approach and attack farms and villages, without being able to avail itself of cover. The employment of the three arms was considerably influenced by the nature of the country ; in all the battles and engagements on the plains of La Beauce the artillery played the chief part, for it could, as a rule, open fire with effect at long ranges. More than ever had the other arms to conform to its movements. Cavalry"], [130, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 122 could move unhindered in every direction, and could patrol to great distances without any anxiety as to its lines of retreat, as it could fall back in any direction it chose. Owing to the openness of the country, it was impossible for the cavalry to surprise the enemy's infantry if the latter displayed ordinary caution. The plains of La Beauce, therefore, had their drawbacks, for cavalry could not, at a distance of more than a thousand yards, hope to make a successful attack even on raw troops, if armed, as in this case, with a good and powerful firearm. The enemy's infantry was able to hinder the movements of the cavalry by covering large spaces with a cross-fire from the numerous but widely-scattered farms. Our infantry had to perform the hardest and most thankless task in the engagements in this district. When on the offensive, it had to advance without cover, and when on the defensive, it had to rely on villages and farms as its only points d'appui. It was im possible to make a gradual advance and at the same time to keep up a fire on the enemy's position, or to move in small bodies from cover to cover. The skirmishers were forced to extend in long thin lines, while the supports could not be massed, but had to lie down or kneel in small detachments in rear of the skirmishing lines, taking advantage of the very scanty cover afforded by the slight inequalities of the ground. The general system of tactics was also materially influenced by the nature of the ground. It was impossible to concentrate con siderable forces under cover, for the purpose of striking a sudden and unexpected blow on the enemy's flank, or at any weak point in his position. Turning movements could be perceived from afar, and therefore parried. The general openness of the country rendered it impossible to deceive the enemy, so as to contain him at one point, and fall upon him with superior forces at another. The Commander-in-Chief's duties, therefore, were confined to making a correct distribution of his forces at the commencement of the battle, extending their front rather than their depth, and posting small reserves in rear of the most important points of the line, rather than forming one main body of reserve. It was seldom possible to man\u0153uvre during a battle, and the result, therefore, depended almost entirely on the morale and numbers of the opposing forces. Modern history offers no instance of battles so completely fought out as those on the plains of La"], [131, "The Advance towards the Loire. 123 Beauce. No engagement was followed by direct pursuit from the field, as a battle terminated only with the complete exhaustion of both sides. The enemy was superior in numbers and the quality of his firearm ; we in officers, morale, and training. The character of the ground was equally favourable or unfavourable to both sides. The fighting usually lasted all day on almost the same ground, and he was victor who, when night came on, had sufficient moral or numerical strength to maintain himself on the field of battle. In the battles fought during December there were no keys of positions or decisive moments. The possession of a village, of a park, was contested for hours, but its loss or occupation did not decide the battle, and was a mere episode in an exhausting struggle. \u2014 The battle-fields of La Beauce offered no instance of a \" Chlum ! \" From a non-military point of view the aspect of La Beauce was decidedly mournful. It may perhaps appear more cheerful in summer, when the standing corn still waves over the fields, but in the latter part of the autumn and in the winter the monotonous plains, with their uncomfortable villages and stupid inhabitants, do not make a pleasant impression, especially when storms of snow and rain render it difficult for man and horse to traverse \" Le Grenier de la France.\" At the horizon the grey sky could not be distinguished from the equally grey and monotonous earth. On the afternoon of this day (October 9th) the 2nd Cavalry Division reported, that its patrols had come upon some of the enemy's cavalry armed with carbines near Guignonville, and that, according to the statements of the inhabitants, French troops about 10,000 strong had been at Pithiviers since the 8th of October. The Officer Commanding the 2nd Cavalry Division at the same time requested to be relieved from the duty of covering the left flank of the Army in its advance on Orleans, and asked permission to march his division again in the direction of Corbeil, in order to cover that point and the road by which the siege-train was advancing, against a conp-dc-main which the enemy might attempt from Pithiviers. General v. d. Tann was unable to grant this request for various reasons. The instructions from Versailles distinctly laid down that the Army was to advance to Orleans, flanked on either side"], [132, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 124 by the 2nd and 4th Cavalry Divisions. No trustworthy intelligence had been received concerning the real strength of the enemy's forces at Pithiviers, and it was quite possible that his numbers had been overstated. If a whole cavalry division were detached, owing to this unconfirmed report, the enemy would have succeeded in weakening the Army in its advance on Orleans, without further trouble than a demonstration on our left flank. If, however, our Army continued its advance, the enemy's position at Pithiviers would be greatly endangered, and it might be presumed that he would either make a hasty retreat on Orleans, or retire by Mon targis to Gien. It was very unlikely that the enemy would advance from Pithiviers towards Corbeil or Melun, while Orleans was occupied in his rear, for an isolated movement of that kind might involve him in unforeseen difficulties. General v. d. Tann determined to advance on the following day to within a short distance of Orleans, and he issued such direc tions to his troops as would ensure a general attack on the town from all sides, in case the enemy should make a stand in its vicinity. The General, however, did not anticipate that this would be the case, for we had not as yet encountered any serious resistance, and it was not likely that the enemy would offer any real opposition with an open town and the Loire in his rear. Orders were issued for a strong reconnaissance in the direction of Pithiviers, to ascertain with certainty the composition of the enemy's troops at that point. The army orders for the ioth of October were as follows : \u2014 The advance guard will march at 6 A.M. by Toury to Artenay, whence it will push a detachment in the direction of Creuzy, until it touches the 4th Brigade, which will undertake the duties of the advance guard in that direction. The main body of the advance guard will move from Artenay to Patay, where it will take up confined cantonments and bivouacks. The remainder of the ist Infantry Division will follow the advance guard at 7 A.M. from Oinville by Toury and Artenay, and will advance to Sougy, Chevaux, Rouvray-St.-Croix, and Topineux, taking measures of precaution towards Orleans. Gra mich's Division of Artillery will be taken from the Reserve Artil lery and be attached to the ist Infantry Division. The 3rd Brigade (2nd Inf. Div.) will march at 7 A.M. from"], [133, "The Advance towards the Loire. 125 Allainville by the St. Lye road to Trinay, Bouilly, Mezieres, La Borde-Chausson, and La Marotte, taking measures of precaution in the directions of the forest of Orleans and of Pithiviers, and establishing communications with Creuzy and Artenay. The 4th Brigade (2nd Inf. Div.) will march at 7 A.M. from Merouville by Allaines to Artenay, where it will take up confined cantonments and push a strong advance guard to La . Croix Briquet and Creuzy, the leading files of which will move into the forest and to Chevilly. Communications are to be established with the ist Infantry Division on the east, and with the 3rd Brigade on the west. Daffner's Division of Artillery will be taken from the Reserve Artillery and be attached to the 2nd Infantry Division. The remainder of the Reserve Artillery (Schleitheim's and Will's Divisions) will follow the 4th Brigade to Poupry, Mameaut, and Milhouard. The 22nd Division will march at 8 A.M. by Toury, into the rayon of Santilly, Dambron, Ruan, Oison, and Tivernon. The 4th Cavalry Division, to which the Bavarian Cuirassier Brigade will still be attached, will march at 7 A.M. by Orgeres and Patay to La Chapelle Onzerain, Villamblain, and Tournoisis, sending its leading files towards Epieds and St. Peravy-la- Colombe. It will establish communications on the left with the ist Infantry Division. Patrols are to be sent towards Orleans and its neighbourhood. The 2nd Cavalry Division is requested to advance towards Grigneville and examine the country towards Pithiviers and Escrennes, obtaining, if possible, accurate intelligence concerning the presence and strength of the enemy. This disposition of the troops would enable them, if necessary, to turn the Forest of Orleans, and advance to the attack across ground which was more open and especially favourable to the use of artillery, while the Brigades of the 2nd Infantry Division, which had been separated from each other since the 8th of October, would be reunited between Trinay and Artenay. During the night General v. d. Tann received directions from Versailles that, on occupying Orleans, he was to impose a con tribution of a million francs on the town. \u2014 War must be self supporting !

ENGAGEMENT of artenay. {October ioth) On the ioth of October the columns of the Army marched at the appointed hours. The weather on this bleak autumnal morning was wet and cold, mist and rain obscured the view, and the ground by the side of the roads was so soft that horses and carriages moved on it with difficulty, and it was only on the paved high road, which was in excellent condition, that they could advance with any rapidity. The advance guard consisted of the ist Brigade, which was divided as follows : \u2014 Advanced party of Advance Guard, ist Batn. ist Regt. (Commanded by Lieut.-Col. Besserer). 2 squadrons 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. 2 4-pounder guns. Main body of Advance Guard. 2nd Batn. ist Regt.* (following at a proper interval), ist Batn. \\ 2nd Batn. I Body Guards. 3rd Batn.fj 2nd Batn. Rifles.

About 9.30 A.M. the advanced files came upon the enemy about an English mile and a half to the north of Artenay. As far as could be ascertained in the mist his strength was two or three battalions, several cavalry regiments, and one battery. Our advanced party took up a position with the ist Batn. 1st Regt. on the road, and the two guns on the west of the road, while the two squadrons covered the right flank, which was threatened by superior forces of the enemy's cavalry on the west of Artenay. As the main body of the advance guard arrived, the troops were formed up by General Dietl. The four guns of the Brigade Battery took up a position close to the two above-mentioned guns, while the 2nd Batn. Body Guards, and 1 y2 companies of the 3rd Batn. Body Guards were drawn up on the right of the ist Batn. ist Regt., and the ist Batn. Body Guards on the left of that battalion but to the right of the road. The 2nd Batn. ist Regt. was directed to move towards the railway embankment, while the 2nd Batn. Rifles was kept back in reserve between the road and the embankment. As soon as Schleich's 6-pounder Battery had opened fire with four guns on the left and two on the right of the road, Major- General Dietl ordered a general advance. In the meantime the squadrons of light cavalry on the right wing had advanced against the enemy's cavalry, but the latter, notwithstanding its greatly superior numbers, fell back on the infantry, which our squadrons were too weak to attack. As, however, we could not calculate on the continued inactivity of the enemy's cavalry, and as the right flank of our infantry might be threatened and hin dered by it in the course of the engagement, General v. d. Tann"], [137, "Engagement of Artenay. 129 ordered the 13th Hussars (22nd Inf. Div.), together with the 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt., to cover the right flank. The engagement grew warmer, and the enemy brought more guns into action on the west of Artenay, which fired with great effect on our troops. While the ist Brigade was deploying, the Officer Commanding the ist Inf. Div. (Lieut-General v. Stephan) had ordered Gramich's Division of Reserve Artillery to cross the railway embankment, escorted by one squadron, and to take up a position on the east of it. This Division crossed the embank ment on the north of Assas and took up a position in the neigh bourhood of the latter place (Soldner's 6-pounder Battery and Prince Leopold's 6-pounder Battery). Another 6-pounder Battery (Hutten's) came into action on the east of the road. It soon became evident, from the steady resistance of the enemy, and from the composition of his troops, which he gradually dis closed, that it was with no insignificant or easily overpowered detachment that we had to deal, and General v. d. Tann decided merely to contain the enemy with his artillery, and to await the threatening movement of the cavalry divisions on the enemy's line of retreat. The cavalry generals had been informed of the commencement of an engagement ; but, even without such informa tion, they would have marched with celerity in the direction of the sound of the cannon. The enemy's infantry was known to be very superior in num bers to our own, and it was evident that we ought to utilise our superiority in cavalry and artillery, and only bring up our infantry after the enemy had been thoroughly shaken. In order to carry out the plan of operations rendered necessary by the above-mentioned circumstances, General v. d. Tann ordered the attack on Artenay and the adjacent positions of the enemy to be delayed. The troops were, however, to take up such positions as would enable them to make a concentric advance when the decisive moment arrived. At 1 1 A.M. the 2nd Brigade advanced into the line of battle. This brigade only consisted of three battalions (4th Batn. Rifles [3 companies], 9th Batn. Rifles, 2nd Batn. nth Regt., one company 2nd Regt.), as the troops which had been detached from it had not yet rejoined. The 9th Batn. Rifles advanced along the railway embankment, the 2nd Batn. ist Regt. with the 8th company at its head having K"], [138, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 130 already pressed forward as far as the station, which it had taken as well as a small French encampment. The 4th Batn. Rifles relieved the ist Batn. ist Regt. in front of the northern entrance of Artenay, the latter having expended its ammunition. The company of the 2nd Regt. {Ersatz Reserve) was ordered to act as escort to the two batteries of Gramich's Division, which were still on the east of the embankment. The 2nd Batn. 1 ith Regt., which at first was retained in reserve, was afterwards directed to move to the left wing, where it was placed under Lieut.-Col. Massenbach, commanding the 9th Batn. Rifles. These two battalions were to take up a position flanking Artenay and the main road leading thence to the south. Grundherr's 4-pounder Battery came into action on the west of the road, on the left of the other batteries. About noon the enemy's fire, which had slightly slackened, increased again in intensity, and it was evident that he had re ceived reinforcements of artillery, which now came into action on the north of Artenay. Gramich's Division, which could no longer be used with effect on the left wing, was ordered to take up a position on the west of the road, which it accordingly did by the side of Hutten's 6-pounder Battery. About this time, the 3rd Brigade, which was marching from Trinay, received an order to form up as a reserve on the north of Artenay, in rear of the ist Infantry Division. General v. d. Tann was determined to keep one brigade intact and ready for any contingency, as an advance of the enemy was still possible. Before we give an account of the movements of the two Cavalry Divisions and the 2nd Infantry Division, it may be as well to describe the general position of the ist Infantry Division, which was engaged on the north of Artenay. Between noon and 1 P.M. it was distributed as follows :\u2014 The 13th Hussars, 2 squadrons 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt, and shortly afterwards 2^ squadrons 4th Lt. Cav. Regt, which had been sent forward from Allaines at a trot, were on the extreme right wing near Poupry. This cavalry covered the right flank against the enemy's cavalry, which was still in the neighbourhood of Autroches, and endea voured to open communications with the 4th Cav. Div., which was expected from the direction of Orgeres. The following troops, viz., l% companies 3rd Batn. Body Guards, ist and 2nd Batns."], [139, "Engagement of Artenay. 131 Body Guards, 2nd and 4th Batns. Rifles, were partly on the high road to Paris, or to the west of it, and partly engaged with the enemy's forces in and around Artenay. The ist Batn. ist Regt., having expended its ammunition, was kept somewhat to the rear. Colonel Tauffenbach was in command of the infantry of the right wing. The following batteries were in action : viz., the two 4-pounder Brigade Batteries (Gruithuisen, Grundherr), the two 6-pounder Batteries of the ist Inf. Div. (Hutten, Schleich), and Gramich's Division of the Reserve Artillery (Soldner's and Prince Leopold's 6-pounder Batteries). The 22nd Inf. Div. was concentrated as main reserve on the high road abreast of Dambron. On the lest wing, the 2nd Batn. ist Regt., which was still led by the 3rd company at the special request of the officer in com mand of the latter, had advanced along the railway embankment as far as the station. On the east of the embankment was the 9th Batn. Rifles, with the 2nd Batn. nth Regt. on its lest flank. The company of the 2nd Regt, that formed the escort to Gramich's Division, detached two subdivisions to join the 9th Batn. Rifles, as soon as the artillery had taken up a position on the west of the road. The fighting, which consisted of an exchange of shots, grew stationary. General v. d. Tann adhered, as usual, to his first determination, and did not give the order for a general attack until the cavalry appeared on both flanks. There can be no doubt that the forces actually on the spot (ist Inf. Div. and 22nd Inf. Div.) would have been sufficient to defeat the enemy, but an offensive movement of such a description would have been at any rate unnecessary, even if not a tactical error, as it would not have led to any important result, and must have occasioned considerable losses. By a front attack we might have driven the enemy be tween noon and 3 P.M. as far to the rear as the Bois d'Orleans ; more, however, could be effected a few hours later and probably with smaller losses, as soon as the cavalry divisions should begin to operate against the enemy's flanks and rear. It will perhaps render our description more clear, if we consider the movements of the remaining portions of the Army separately, and then try to unite the whole into one coup d'\u0153il. At 3 A.M. the 4th Cavalry Division was concentrated at Allaines. The ioth Cavalry Brigade formed the advance guard, the 8th K 2"], [140, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 132 Cavalry Brigade and the Bavarian Cuirassier Brigade, with its two batteries, constituted the main body, while the 9th Cavalry Brigade was directed to march as a flanking column on the right by Orgeres and Villemblain. About 10 A.M. the Hussars, who were at the head of the column, were fired upon from the park at Tout-li-faut, and lost a few men and horses. The artillery at once came into action, and set Tout li-faut and Marasson farm on fire. The enemy disappeared, and the Cavalry Division continued its march by La Maladerie and Loigny towards Favarolles. The head of the column had passed this place, when the sound of cannon was heard in the direction of Artenay. Prince Albrecht (senior), who was in command of the Division, at once directed the march towards the sound of the cannon, and the Division, with the exception of the 9th Cavalry Brigade, advanced by Terminiers to Echelles, where it received intelligence from the 2nd Inf. Div. that a serious engagement had commenced at Artenay, and that cavalry was urgently needed. The 4th Cav. Div. at once continued its march at a quick pace. Having arrived abreast of Ouvans, the Division deployed. The right wing, consisting of the ioth Brigade, was echelloned to the front; the left wing consisted of the 5th Brigade, and in its rear was the Cuirassier Brigade in second line. The batteries were placed in first line. (It was now about 2 P.M.) The 4th Brigade* (7th Batn. Rifles, ist, 2nd, and 3rd Batns. ioth Regt, ist, 2nd, and 3rd Batns. 13th Regt., Baumuller's 4-pounder Brigade Battery), together with Sewalder's 6-pounder Battery of the Divisional Artillery, and an attached division of the Reserve Artillery (Maj. Daffner), 2}i squadrons 4th Lt. Cav. Regt. and two subdivisions of the Hospital Corps had arrived at Le Puiset, when about 10 A.M. the sound of cannon was heard on the west in the direction of Tout-li-faut, and also on the south-east. From the reconnaissances which were made, it appeared that the 4th Cavalry Division had not encountered any real opposition, and, as the firing on the west soon ceased, the march was con tinued. At Allaines news was received that the ist Infantry Division was engaged at Artenay, and that the enemy had a strong force of cavalry. * Three companies had not returned from escorting prisoners."], [141, "Engagement of Artenay. 133 The 2y2 squadrons of the 4th Lt. Cav. Regt. were ordered to advance at a trot to the battle-field, where, as already mentioned, they joined the cavalry on the right wing of the ist Inf. Div., and an orderly officer was at once sent back to give information of the state of affairs to the 4th Cavalry Division. The Brigade advanced with the utmost possible expedition, but the roads had been so much damaged by the rain that the infantry, in spite of the greatest exertions, could not advance as quickly as the increasing sound of the cannon seemed to render desirable. In order that the artillery, at any rate, should take part in the engagement, Baumiiller's 4-pounder Battery and Sewalder's 6-pounder Battery were ordered to advance at a trot, and they were shortly followed by the Division of Reserve Artillery (Mehn's and Neu's 6-pounder Batteries). By the time these arrangements were completed, it was 2 p.m. On the extreme left wing, the 2nd Cavalry Division had been concentrated at 6 A.M. at Acbouille, about 3 miles to the east of Outarville. The 4th Cavalry Brigade and one battery of horse artillery were to advance towards Pithiviers, while the 3rd and 5th Cavalry Brigades, with the other battery of horse artillery, were to march to Montvilliers, and thence to reconnoitre in the direction of Escrennes and the road from Pithiviers to Orleans. Pithiviers had been completely evacuated during the preceding night, and the inhabitants reported that the enemy had retired in the direc tion of Orleans, and now formed part of the troops opposing us at Artenay. At Montvilliers the sound of cannon was heard, and Lieut- General v. Stolberg at once ordered the 5 th Cavalry Brigade to advance in the direction of the firing ; he then followed with the 3rd and 4th Brigades, as soon as the latter Brigade arrived from Pithiviers. At Acheres-le-Marche the Division halted to give the horses breathing-time, and then advanced to the eastern part of the battle-field of Artenay, which it reached about 2 p.m. The 2nd Cav. Div. had marched more than 40 English miles between 6 A.M. and 2 p.m. It had then fought till dusk, when a few isolated but spirited attacks were made. No cavalry could be required to do more."], [142, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 134 Soon after the commencement of the engagement, General v. d. Tann had despatched an officer to direct the 3rd Brigade against the enemy's right flank at Artenay. This officer, who accidentally had no map, went too much to the east, and did not come up with the Brigade for some time. When abreast of Crottes, the sound of firing was heard, and the Brigade changed its original direction, and marched westwards by Acheres and Trinay, along very bad and heavy roads. The Brigadier, having obtained information as to the general state of the battle, intended to advance by La Maison Brulee upon the enemy's right flank, but this movement was not carried out, General v. d. Tann having, as already mentioned, sent an order to the 3rd Brigade to march to a position in rear of the left wing of the ist Infantry Brigade, and there to form the reserve. This (3rd) Brigade entered the battle-field at 2 p.m., and was constituted as follows*: \u2014 ist Batn. Rifles; ist, 2nd, and 3rd Batns. 3rd Regt.; 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Batns. 12th Regt. ; Stadel mann's 4-pounder Brigade Battery ; Metz' 6-pounder Battery, belonging to the Divisional Artillery ; 1 squadron 4th Lt. Cav. Regt., and one subdivision of the Hospital Corps. It is apparent from the preceding account, that about 2 p.m. all the columns, with the exception of the infantry of the 4th Brigade, were either actually on the battle-field or exerting an influence on the enemy by threatening his line of retreat. Four more batteries f had taken up a position on the right flank of the artillery, and four batteries belonging to the 4th Cav. Div., which was advancing from Ouvans towards Creuzy, also opened fire upon the enemy's artillery at Autroches, while both batteries of horse artillery of the 2nd Cav. Div. shelled the farms of La Grange and Arblay on the right flank of the enemy. General v. d. Tann now ordered Lieut-General v. Stephan to advance with his Division and to take Artenay. If the attack on this place and its neighbourhood had been made a few hours earlier, it would probably have been attended with considerable loss, and a much more determined opposition would have been encountered, but now the enemy's position was carried at the first onslaught. The Body Guards forced their way in on the west, the 2nd Batn. * Two companies had not returned from escorting prisoners. f Belonging lo the 4th Brigade."], [143, "Engagement of Artenay. 135 Rifles by the principal entrance on the north, and the 4th Batn. Rifles a little to the left of the latter. The 9th Batn. Rifles, 2nd Batn. nth Regt., and the companies of the 2nd Regt, all of which belonged to the ist Brigade, had made a wheel to the right, pivoting on La Maison Brulee. This farm, on the south of Artenay, had been taken by the 9th Batn. Rifles, which then in the general attack forced its way into Artenay from the south-east. The enemy was repulsed at all points. The threatening advance of the cavalry divisions forced his artillery, which had maintained its position extremely well throughout the engagement, to retire hastily, and in carrying out its retreat three guns were lost, two of them with their horses. The enemy's cavalry, which had really only played the part of an accessory on the battle-field, now retired at a quick pace, while the infantry fell back hastily and in disorder on the Bois d'Orleans ; but a part occupied a wood on the south of Artenay, where they offered a stubborn resistance. They were, however, soon driven out by the 4th and 9th Batns. Rifles and detachments of the Body Guards, with the assistance of Stadelmann's 4-pounder Battery, which advanced to within 600 yards of the wood and shelled the edge. The ist and 2nd Brigades continued the pursuit as far as La Croix Briquet, where about 5 00 of the enemy's infantry sur- rendered to about two subdivisions of the 2nd Regt. and a similar detachment of the 4th Batn. Rifles. The 4th Batn. Rifles, in con- tinuing the pursuit, took a gun abandoned by the enemy. General v. d. Tann and his staff had ridden to the southern outskirts of Artenay after its successful capture, and had issued an order that the 3rd Brigade, which was still intact, should advance along the railway embankment and take possession of Chevilly, one of the principal entrances into the Forest of Orleans, and therefore of importance with reference to the operations of the next day. We have still to mention the movements of the two cavalry divisions, to the co-operation of which the enemy's flight was chiefly due. As soon as the 4th Cav. Div. had reached the neighbourhood of Creuzy, two squadrons (3rd and 4th) 5th Regt. of Dragoons, under the command of Captain Count Kilmansegge, attacked the re treating enemy and galloped across the high road, but were checked"], [144, "136 The Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. by the steep railway embankment, which was still held by the enemy's infantry. While the Dragoons trotted back, three squadrons 2nd Regt. of Hussars, under Colonel v. Schauroth, advanced to the attack, took one gun and its horses, and made above 120 prisoners. The Bavarian Cuirassier Brigade now came into first line. The scouts galloped forward as far as the railway embankment, which was no longer held by the enemy, and two squadrons of the ist Regt. of Cuirassiers (Captains Rhomberg and Scheffer) attacked immediately afterwards, making numerous prisoners. The 2nd Cav. Div. had at first been delayed in its advance by the farms of La Grange and Arblay, which were still occupied by the French. The enemy was at last driven out and retreated hastily along the embankment into the wood, which was close at hand. One squadron 2nd Regt. of Silesian Lancers (Capt. v. Blticher) con trived to overtake the enemy, and captured a gun and its horses almost in the midst of the enemy's skirmishers. About 5 p.m. the firing gradually ceased, and only the batteries of the 3rd Brigade at Andeglou continued to throw a few shells into Chevilly, which the enemy soon abandoned, and which was then occupied without further resistance by the 3rd Brigade. Thanks to the decision with which General v. d. Tann absolutely forbade a premature attack on the enemy's position, the German losses were comparatively slight. His plan of containing the enemy, until the cavalry appeared on both flanks, was most suc cessful. Even if the enemy's position had been completely taken by noon, the result would not have been as great as it was later, on the appearance of the cavalry divisions. We must acknowledge a fact, which redounds to our own credit, namely, that, with the exception of the cavalry, the enemy fought most bravely ; and .we must repeat, that his artillery was very inferior in numbers to our own, and his cavalry of little or no use. With regard to the infantry, the troops which actually took part in the engagement were not more numerous than those of the French. Only the ist Inf. Div., which consisted of 9 battalions, with a total strength of 31^ companies, came under fire."], [145, "Engagement of Artenay. 137 The losses of the I. Corps were as follows : \u2014 Killed, 1 officer, 35 men, Wounded, 5 officers, 166 \u201e Missing, \u2014 \u201e 5 \u201e 6 officers, 206 men. The stereotyped phrase \" the enemy's losses are unknown, but must have been much more serious than our own,\" cannot be taken as conclusive in this case, considering the hasty retreat of the enemy and the want of serious resistance on his part. So much is certain, that 3 French guns* and more than 1,000-f- unwounded prisoners, including several officers,}\" fell into our hands. The dull morning was followed by a fine evening. The clouds had disappeared and the clear sky seemed to promise a gay entrance on the morrow into the city of Joan of Arc. After the engagement the troops took up the following confined quarters and bivouacks. The advance guard was formed by the 3rd Brigade, and was distributed as follows: \u2014 - The 2nd and 3rd Batns. 3rd Regt., 2nd Batn. 12th Regt, and one 6-pounder Battery (Metz) in La Croix Briquet. The ist Batn. Rifles, ist Batn. 3rd Regt., and one 4-pounder Battery (Stadelmann) in a bivouack at Chevilly. The 3rd Batn. 12th Regt. and one squadron 4th Lt. Cav.

Divs., and the ist Inf. Div. f The capture of 500 men in La Croix Briquet is an instance of the effect produced by the advance of the cavalry on the enemy's line of retreat. These men were retreating along the road, when they were attacked by the squadrons of the 4th Cav. Div. and driven back into the village, where, seeing that their line of retreat was cut off, they at once surrendered. X It is a singular fact, that among the prisoners was a \" Commandant\" of the National Guard, who, to judge by his new and elegant uniform, had only been mobilised a few days. This officer actually requested General v. d. Tann to allow him to post (!) to Orleans, on the plea that his absence would cause much uneasiness. It would have evidently been impossible to convince a man with such naive views on military matters of the impracticability of granting his request, and he was merely requested to follow a Cuirassier and join the rest of the prisoners, which his varnished boots and the state of the roads, soaked with rain and cut up by the German cavalry, must have rendered a matter of no slight difficulty."], [146, "138 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. The 4th Brigade was cantoned and bivouacked in Creuzy and La Croix Briquet. Of the ist Inf.

Tann took up his quarters in Artenay after having personally expressed his thanks to the Commander of the 4th Cav. Div., Prince Albrecht (senior), for having so largely contributed to the successful termination of the engagement. The Chief of the Staff drew up such dispositions for the follow ing day as would ensure an attack on the enemy from all sides, in case he made a stand on the north of Orleans. The Orders were as follows : \u2014 \" The march will be continued to-morrow in three columns.\" \" The ist column will consist of the 22nd Inf.

THE ACTION AND OCCUPATION OF ORLEANS. {October iitli) The aspect of La Beauce on the morning of the nth of October once more proved the truth of the saying, \" There is no rule without an exception.\" The clear and sunny sky, the undulating hills, and the woods which still retained their foliage, made the country, at other times so monotonous, appear almost beautiful. The farms and villages looked so bright and glistening in the distance, that one almost forgot that they were inhabited by our enemies. It was by no means certain that the enemy would offer any serious resistance. His hasty retreat, resembling a flight, the insufficient training of his troops as shown by the prisoners, and the unfavourable position in which he would have to fight with a large open town and a wide river in his rear, all led to the conclusion that, in order to avoid a second defeat, the French would concentrate their forces on the left bank of the Loire. The columns left their cantonments and bivouacks at different hours, according to the distances they had to traverse before reach ing the rendezvous. The strength of the forces which took part in the action of Orleans was almost the same as we have already stated, with the exception of the 2nd Cav. Div., which confined itself to demon strations and patrols. Against this, however, we must set off the 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt., which had joined the 2nd Brigade,* and ix/2 * The company consisting of men of the Ersatz Reserve had been detailed as escort to prisoners."], [149, "The Action and Occupation of Orleans. 141 companies of the 12th Regt., which rejoined the 3rd Brigade from escorting prisoners. The ist column (22nd Inf. Div.) was concentrated at Dambron, and marched at 4.30 A.M. by Poupry (where it was joined by the five Bavarian batteries), Beaugency, Chevaux, and Huetre, towards Briey. The Hussars, who were acting as scouts, were fired upon from the latter place. While the village was being searched, the column continued its march towards Boulay. At Les Barres, the head of the column was received with a brisk musketry fire, and large columns of the enemy's infantry were visible in the direction of Orleans. Two squadrons of French Cuirassiers had previously shown themselves at Boulay, but they soon fell back when attacked by the Hussars. Lieut.- General v. Wittich drew up his four batteries close to the windmill at Boulay, and shelled Les Barres and the wood in rear of it. The fire had lasted for some time, when the Mayor of Les Barres, with his tricolored sash, hastened to General v. Wittich, and implored him to spare the town, assuring him that it had been evacuated by the enemy. Our troops thereupon advanced and found Les Barres and the adjoining wood deserted by the enemy. It was about 9.30 A.M. when the first shot was fired at Boulay; General v. d. Tann, who was then in the neighbourhood of Huetre, rode towards the spot where the engagement commenced, followed by the Cuirassier Brigade, which he had ordered to advance on the receipt of the intelligence that French cavalry had appeared at Boulay. By the time the General had reached the heights to the east of Boulay, Les Barres had been taken without any opposition. A plain lay before him, extending to the white houses of Ormes, which could be distinctly seen in the distance. On the left (north) it was bounded by an offshoot of the great Forest of Orleans, which extended almost as far as Boulay ; on the right (south) by the high road to Chateaudun and the adjoining plantations. At Ormes the ground seemed to rise and to be covered by a reddish vegetation, an appearance which, according to the map, was caused by the presence of vineyards, and among which a few scattered houses and villas could be seen."], [150, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 142 The tower of the Cathedral of Orleans, the goal and prize of the contest, rose majestically in the background. It was on the above-mentioned plain that Lieutenant-General v. Wittich drew up his troops, and the evolutions were as accurately carried out as on the parade-ground. At Orleans, the 22nd Inf. Div. fought for the first time by the side of the I. Corps. During the campaign we often fought side by side with these brave troops, and a warm friendship soon sprang up. We were always ready to render each other assistance, at whatever cost. This alliance with the men and the leaders of the 22 nd Div., which began at Orleans, was ratified two months later in the sanguinary engagements at Cravant. Lieut-General v. Wittich issued the following orders :- \u2014 The 44th Brigade (Colonel Marschall, 83rd and 94th Regts.*), with the five Bavarian Batteries in rear, will advance along the high road to Ormes. The 43rd Brigade (Colonel Kontzky, 32nd and 95th Regts.f). will march to La Borde, by Heurdy, leaving the farm of Bois Girard on the right. The four Prussian Batteries were to advance between Les Barres and Heurdy, while the Cuirassier Brigade, which during the engagement was to be attached to Lt.-General v. Wittich, was to follow the 43rd Brigade. The 43rd Hussars were to cover the right flank, and with that object were to go round to the south of the wood at Les Barres. It was about 11 A.M. when the 22nd Div. began its advance in the above formation. Intelligence was meanwhile received from the 4th Cav. Div., that one brigade had been detached against Meung-sur-Loire, and patrols had been sent out towards Chateau dun, while the remainder of the Division was at St. Peravy. Before we describe the engagement which took place at Ormes, we must give an account of the movements of the other columns up to this hour (11 A.M.), which in some instances had led to severe engagements. The 2nd column, which consisted of the 4th Brigade (7th Batn. Rifles, 1st, 2nd and 3rd Batns. ioth Regt, ist, 2nd and 3rd Batns. 13th Regt., Baumuller's 4-pounder Brigade Battery, 2}4 squadrons * The 83rd Regt. had three and a half companies, the 94th only three companies. f The 32nd Regt. had eleven and a half companies, the 95th ten companies."], [151, "The Action and Occupation of Orleans. 143 of the 4th Lt. Cav. Regt., and three 6-pounder Batteries com manded by Sewalder, Neu and Mehn), was concentrated at 9 A.M. at Gidy. Any further advance along the old road between Chartres and Orleans would render communications with the ist column very difficult, and a flanking column was therefore detached on the right to establish communications. The 7th Batn. Rifles, ist Batn. ioth Regt. (3 companies), ist Batn. 13th Regt. {2% companies), and Baumiiller's 4-pounder Battery, under the command of Lieut-Col. Joner, marched accord ingly from Gidy southwards into the forest. The main column commenced its march towards Saran at about 10 A.M. Meantime the flanking column had advanced by Sary farm, and thence directed its march towards Saran. The enemy occupied a farm situated on the north-west of Saran and at the entrance to the wood, in great force, and was making a vigorous resistance with the assistance of some artillery. The mass of the 4th Brigade debouched from the wood on the north of Saran, and joined the flanking column in the engage ment. At 1 1 A.M. the 2nd column was engaged in a sharp contest for the possession of Saran and the farms to its west. The whole of the ground, that was fought over on this day, was as unfavourable as possible. The vineyards obstructed the view on every side, and rendered it difficult even for the infantry to advance. There was no range well adapted for the guns, and they could only be used on the roads. At Saran some guns were brought to bear on a strongly-fortified farm-house, and facilitated its capture, but in every other case the infantry were obliged to carry the massive loopholed buildings by assault, without any support from the artillery. The tactical direction of the troops was a difficult task even for the leaders of companies, and a mutual and timely support was almost impos sible, as the greater or less intensity of the fire and the smoke of the guns were often the only indications of the state of the battle. The 3rd column, consisting of the 3rd Brigade (ist Batn. Rifles, 1st, 2nd and 3rd Batns. 3rd Regt, ist, 2nd and 3rd Batns. 12th Regt., and Stadelmann's 4-pounder Battery), 1% squadrons 4th Lt. Cav. Regt, and Metz' 6-pounder Battery, began its march from Chevilly to Orleans at 9 A.M."], [152, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 144 A flanking column, consisting of the ist and 3rd Batns. 12th Regt., had been detached to the left, under Colonel Narciss, and was to advance by Mouchene (east of Chevilly) against Les Aides. The advance guard, consisting of ist Batn. Rifles, ist Batn. 3rd Regt, and a 4-pounder Battery, reached Cercottes at 9.45 A.M., and here the first shots were exchanged. Almost at the same moment the flanking column had come upon the enemy (Papal Zouaves) in the Avenue de Chonteau. Cercottes was quickly abandoned by the enemy, and the French troops in the wood, being pressed by the column under Colonel Narciss, fell back towards the south-west. As the fire in the wood became hotter, the Brigade advanced to the south of Cercottes, with the ist Batn. Rifles, ist and 2nd Batns. 3rd Regt. in first line, and the 3rd Batn. 3rd Regt. and 2nd Batn. 1 2th Regt. in second line. Two companies of the 2nd Batn. 3rd Regt. were detached, at the request of Colonel Narciss, to strengthen the flanking column, which was under a hot fire, and the advance was then continued. Soon after 1 1 A.M. the 3rd Brigade was almost abreast of the 2nd column, which was fiercely contesting the possession of Saran. At this moment (11 A.M.) the main reserve (ist Inf. Div.) was a cJieval on the high road, about 1 y2 English miles to the south of Chevilly. One company of the 4th Batn. Rifles and two sub divisions of light cavalry had been sent into the forest on the east to protect the lest flank, and the former afterwards joined the flanking column of the 3rd Brigade, and remained with it during the whole engagement. As soon as the ist column began to move, the Hussars sent out scouts, who returned with the intelligence, that the enemy had thrown up entrenchments at Ormes. A line of rifle pits extended from the Bois de Girard to the wood on the north, and on the south earthworks for infantry and artillery had been thrown up as far as the road. A battery on the south of the high road suddenly opened fire on the column, and shortly afterwards the musketry fire commenced in earnest. The enemy had evacuated the two farms of Les Masures and Bois Girard, but seemed prepared to make an obstinate stand in the entrenchments between Ormes and La Borde. By Lieut-General v. Wittich's order, a Prussian 4-pounder battery, with two 6-pounder Bavarian batteries on its right, took"], [153, "The Action and Occupation of Orleans. 145 up a position on the south of the road, while two Prussian and one Bavarian 6-pounder batteries were placed between the road and Bois Girard. These six batteries kept up a vigorous fire upon the entrenchments and the ground to the rear from a com paratively short distance, viz. 1,200 paces. The enemy made a most obstinate resistance, and even attempted on several occa sions to assume the offensive and to make sallies from the entrenchments, but each time his intention was frustrated by the well-directed fire of our guns. The 44th Brigade had found a certain amount of cover in a hollow opposite Ormes and near Les Masures, and was awaiting a favourable moment to attack the entrenchments, while the 43rd Brigade continued to advance by La Borde, in order to turn the right flank of the enemy. The Cuirassier Brigade was ordered by Lieut-General v. Wittich to move nearer to Bois Girard, in order to be ready to charge in case the enemy should attempt a serious sortie. It was evident from the hot artillery fire, and the whole de meanour of the enemy's troops, that the bulk of his force lay between Ormes and Orleans. General v. d. Tann made the necessary arrangements to send supports to General v. Wittich during the continuance of the engagement. The position of the enemy's batteries led to the belief that an attack from the south upon the right flank of the 22nd Inf. Div. was not improbable, and General v. d. Tann despatched an officer to St. P6ravy, to bring up the 4th Cav. Div. and to direct it against the left flank of the enemy. Prince Albrecht of Prussia at once obeyed the summons of the General, and the 4th Cav. Div., with the two Bavarian batteries at its head, moved at a rapid trot along the high road to Ormes, where it arrived at 1 p.m., a few minutes after the trenches had been carried. At noon, when the artillery fire had lasted nearly an hour, and the enemy still maintained his position, General v. d. Tann ordered the ist Brigade, which formed the main reserve, to ad vance upon Ormes. When this order was issued, no reports had been received from the two other columns, which led to the belief that they must have encountered unusual opposition. The enemy in the entrenchments now evinced considerable uneasiness, which was probably due to the pressure of the 43rd Brigade on his line of retreat, which was directly threatened by a L"], [154, "146 The Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. wheel to the right of the 32nd Regt. It was, however, the gallant behaviour of the artillery at Ormes that decided the day. Reder's Bavarian 6-pounder Battery,* and Gillern's Prussian 4-pounder Battery limbered up under the enemy's fire and gal loped forward to within 800 paces of the entrenchments, where they took up a position, and, after a few well-directed shots, suc ceeded in dislodging the enemy, who retired in haste. This moment was seized by the Officer Commanding the 44th Brigade. The 83rd Regiment, which was lying in a hollow near the road, was ordered to attack, and at the sound of the \" general advance \" the trenches were stormed and carried with loud cheers, which were taken up along the whole line. The enemy retired in disorder on Ingre, those who took the high road falling into the hands of the 32nd and 83rd Regts., which made nearly 1,000 prisoners. The enemy's chief forces at Ormes were thus defeated soon aster 1 p.m. We must now return to the movements of the other two columns between 1 1 A.M. and 1 p.m. The 4th Brigade was still engaged in a contest for the posses sion of Saran and the neighbouring farms and gardens. The enemy had taken up very favourable positions, and defended them with the greatest tenacity, especially against the flanking column ; the advance of the Brigade was therefore very slow, and attended by considerable losses. t The 3rd Brigade, having come up at 11 A.M., continued to ad vance, after having easily defeated a small detachment of the enemy, which attempted to make a stand on the edge of the wood on the south of Cercottes. About noon, the 1st Batn. Rifles, which was at the head of the column, again came upon the enemy at Sougis, which, as well as a park between the road and the railway embankment, was strongly occupied. Artillery could be used at this point, and Stadelmann's 4-pounder Battery and two 6-pounder guns were brought into action on the east of the road against the park. The enemy evacuated Sougis and retired upon Bel Air, and * Only four guns of Reder's Battery took part in this bold attack ; the other two guns had been detached. f Of the artillery attached to this Brigade only the two 6-pounder guns were with the main column, while Baumuller's 4-pounder Battery was with the flanking column. At Saran the enemy had divided a battery into three parts, which did good service against a farm, that had been taken by the 7th Batn. Rifles."], [155, "Tlie Action and Occupation of Orleans. 147 the brigade continued its advance and entered upon a zone of country, which extends for nearly six English miles round Orleans on the north of the Loire, and which we have already mentioned as rendering the advance and guidance of the troops equally difficult. The undulating ground was covered with thickly planted vineyards, and, in addition to this, the 3rd Brigade was obliged to advance, fighting its way from house to house, each with its garden or walled park forming a fresh entrenchment for the enemy. The head of the column was received with a brisk fire from the houses of Bel Air, at which point the enemy seemed inclined to concentrate his defence. Two 6-pounder guns were drawn up on the road and two more on the east near a windmill, in order to prepare for the attack, the nature of the ground not permitting us to use more than four guns at this point. While these four guns directed their fire upon the houses of Bel Air,* the battalions in first line advanced slowly down the gentle slope towards the village. It was about 1 p.m., when the 3rd Brigade entered upon this, the severest struggle of the day. Colonel Narciss' column, which had been more hindered in its advance by the thick undergrowth than by the enemy, had at last debouched from the wood close to La Foulonnerie, and was ad vancing along the railway embankment. During this advance, Colonel Narciss received an order to wheel to the right and to advance against the east side of Les Aides. After the capture of the trenches at Ormes a pause had ensued, caused partly by the inequalities of the ground, and partly by the necessity of reconstructing the tactical formation of the troops. Lieut-General v. Wittich ordered the 43rd Brigade, with the 95 th Regt. in first line, and the 32nd Regt. in second line, to pursue the French along the road, isolated detachments of whom still held the vineyards. The 44th Brigade continued to advance on the right of the road towards Ingre. The 22nd Division had been distributed on the preceding night over a considerable tract of country, and several of its detach ments had been obliged to break up their camps at 2 a.m., in order to reach the rendezvous at Dambron at the appointed hour. * Bel Air is really only a continuation of Les Aides to the north. L 2"], [156, "The Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. 148 The troops had, therefore, been nearly 12 hours on the march or engaged in fighting. In order to give the Prussian troops time to rest, General v. d. Tann placed the ist Brigade, which had reached Bois Girard on its march to Ormes, at Lieut.-General v. Wittich's disposal. The 22nd Division had advanced as far as the road from Ingre to Bel Air, but was not actually engaged with the enemy at that moment, and it was therefore left to General v. Wittich's discretion to employ the ist Brigade in indirect support of the other columns, from which reports had been received that the enemy was obstinately opposing their advance. The disadvantages of the ground again made themselves severely felt, for it was impossible to judge of the progress made by the other columns, except by the sound of the musketry fire. General v. d. Tann arrived at 3 P.M. at the road which branches off to Bel Air. On his lest (north), where the centre column, 4th Brigade, was supposed to be, the firing had almost totally ceased, while to his left front (north-east) the rattle of musketry was clearly audible. From this state of things it was not difficult to infer, that the 4th Brigade was waiting for the advance of the two flanking columns, while the column on the extreme left (3rd Brigade) was engaged in an obstinate conflict with the enemy. The 1st Brigade was therefore ordered to advance to relieve these two columns and to fill up the space between the 22nd Inf. Div. and the centre column ; it accordingly moved forward as quickly as the encumbered state of the road, which was crowded with guns, ambulances, &c, would permit, but it was past 3 p.m. when it arrived at Villeneuve. General v. d. Tann now issued an order to Major-General Dietl to leave the road and turn to the left (north) with three battalions, (ist and 2nd Batns., and 1 comp. 3rd Batn. Body Guards, and 2nd Batn. Rifles), and to advance against Orleans between the 4th Brigade and the 95th Regt. On leaving the high road, these battalions were obliged to make use of a small bridle-road, and this circumstance, together with the difficulties always encountered even by a small body of troops in marching through such thick plantations, caused considerable delay, and it was 4.30 p.m. before the attack was made upon Orleans. The 2nd Batn. Rifles was in first line, with the ist and 2nd"], [157, "The Action and Occupation of Orleans. 149 companies thrown out as skirmishers. These soon communicated with the 95th Regt. on the right, and an united advance was made towards the railway embankment. It was thickly occupied by the enemy's skirmishers, who received our riflemen with a brisk and rapid fire, such as could only be maintained by chasse pots. Fortunately the ground sloped down towards the embank ment, and the hail of bullets whistled harmlessly over their heads. (The 2nd Batn. Rifles only lost 1 officer, 27 men.) A musketry engagement with an enemy so well armed and posted would have been a mere piece of folly. The \" charge \" was sounded, and the embankment was stormed with loud cheers. The defenders hardly waited for the attack ; they had been taken simultaneously in both flanks, and fled in disorder to the town. As soon as Dietl's Brigade had commenced its advance, General v. d. Tann had ordered Gillern's Prussian 4-pounder Battery to take up a position on a bye-road and to throw shells into Orleans. It was fast growing dusk ; the firing on the left wing (3rd Brigade) was becoming more intense, and the enemy seemed to be con centrating his defence on that side. If the town was to be in our hands before nightfall, all available forces would have to be united in a last effort. The hot fire from the railway embank ment had just commenced, and in order to overcome this opposi tion, Lieut.-Colonel Heinleth, Chief of the Staff, directed the 32nd Regt., which was on the right of the road, to advance against and to cross the embankment, so as to attack the enemy on his left flank, and he then led the last intact reserve, the ist Regt. (ist Batn. and 3rd comp. 2nd Batn.), along the high road against the town. The latter regiment, headed by the ist Batn., advanced, singing and with bands playing, amidst the cheers of the Prussians. The embankment, already deserted by the enemy, was passed, and the closed gate of the Faubourg St. Jean was reached, where the troops were received with a hail of bullets and hand-grenades. Major Liineschloss, in command of the ist Batn., was wounded, and several more were either killed or wounded. There was a momentary hesitation, but Lieut.-Colonel Heinleth and Major Liineschloss, who still kept his saddle in spite of his wound, cheered on the men ; and they, with their officers at the head of the battalions, battered in the side-entrances, and rushed into the town with loud cheers, driving the enemy before them."], [158, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 150 It was about 6 p.m. when the ist Regt. made its way into Orleans, and a quarter of an hour later the capture of the proud city was formally declared by the occupation of the \" Place \" and the \" Mairie \" by the 8th comp, ist Regt The ist column (22nd Inf. Div. and ist Brigade) had through out the engagement and up to the capture of Orleans been en tirely unsupported, as the other columns could only indirectly take any share in the fighting. The 3rd and 4th Brigades, on the other hand, fought in connection with each other, and had to accomplish the hardest task of that memorable day. Our last mention of the 2nd and 3rd columns was at 1 p.m., when the entrenchments were carried at Ormes. The 2nd column was then still contesting the possession of Saran, while the 3rd column was commencing an attack on Bel Air, and Colonel Narciss' troops were advancing. The 5th and 6th comps. ioth Regt. had been detached from the main body of the 2nd column to occupy the churchyard of Saran and a large adjacent farm. The 3rd Batn. 13th Regt. meanwhile gained possession of the houses in the northern part of Saran, and advanced as far as the church, where it overcame the obstinate resistance of the enemy with the help of two 6-pounder guns. The French retired through the vineyards towards the south, leaving several prisoners in our hands, while the 3rd Batn. 13th Regt. advanced in pursuit, and took possession of the farm, L'Orme au Coin, on the south of Saran. After the capture of Saran there was no marked object of attack, that would tend to concentrate our forces, and as any survey of the position was impossible, and the different battalions and companies had dispersed singly in pursuit of the enemy, any attempt to undertake the general guidance of the column was almost useless. It would only confuse our description, which we have hitherto tried to render clear, were we to attempt to give any account of the movements of the smaller tactical units. The 3rd Brigade, as a whole, wheeled to the left after the cap ture of Saran, pivoting on Les Murlins. The 3rd Batn. 13th Re\u00b0t. (Major Gumppenburg) had advanced upon this place, and after a hard contest had passed it and reached the Paris road. It was thus in rear of the enemy, who was still offering a stubborn resistance in Les Aides."], [159, "The Action and Occupation of Orleans. 151 On the right of the 3rd Batn. 13th Regt. two companies of the 2nd Batn. 13th Regt* had advanced as far as La Grange des Groues,f opposite the railway embankment, where they were joined on the right by the 3rd and 4th comps. 7th Batn. Rifles, 2nd and 8th comps. ioth Regt., and later by the 1st Batn. 13th Regt. The latter troops were engaged in a hot contest with the French, who held the embankment with a strong line of skir mishers. The cheers of the ist Brigade, as it stormed the embank ment, were the signal for the 4th Brigade to advance to the attack, and the several detachments vied with each other which should first cross the embankment and reach the suburbs of Orleans. The entrance of the ist Brigade and the 32nd Regt. into the Faubourg St. Jean was effected almost simultaneously with that of the 4th Brigade into the Faubourg Bannier. The battalions of the latter brigade were, it must be confessed, somewhat in con fusion. The troops at the head of the 3rd column (3rd Brigade) had taken the houses in the northern part of Bel Air at the first on slaught, but had afterwards encountered such determined opposi tion, that it became impracticable for the moment to continue their offensive movements. The enemy's sheltered position in the houses and behind the garden walls gave him a decided advantage in the engagement, which gradually became stationary, With the exception of the four 6-pounder guns already in position, no artillery could be used. The second line gradually became involved in this musketry engagement, which lasted for nearly two hours, without being able to better the wavering fortunes of the day. The flanking column on the left had meanwhile advanced by Les Ecares along the railway embankment, and had reached the station of Les Aubrais.j The preparations for the defence of the station and the adjacent buildings were so elaborate, that they must have been commenced some time before. \u00ab One company had joined the 3rd Batn. 13th Regt., and one company was still escorting prisoners. f On this occasion, as well as at the station of Les Aubrais, on another part of the battle field, the French made use of a very unsoldierlike ruse. They ceased firing and made signs with caps and handkerchiefs, and then surprised the Germans with a sudden volley. X This was the junction for Beaugency."], [160, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 152 The approaches were defended by tambours, rifle-pits, and chevaux-de-frise ; the windows on the ground floor were barricaded with thick boards, and in the upper stories loopholes had been made in the masonry. The vineyards on the east of the station were also strongly occupied, and the advancing column was fired upon from the eastern outskirts of Les Aides. Once in possession of Les Aubrais, we could attack Les Aides from the south, and render that assistance to the main column of which it stood so much in need. Colonel Narciss quickly resolved to attack the station. Three comps. 3rd Batn. 12th Regt. (9th, ioth, nth), supported by three comps. ist Batn. Rifles,* stormed the goods-shed and the station, and the 1st Batn. 12th Regt. followed in reserve. In order to maintain our advantage, it would be necessary to take the enemy's positions in the neighbouring vineyards, gardens, and farms. The company and a half that represented the ist Batn. 12th Regt., were now used in the attack, and with the 3 rd Batn. 12th Regt. they stormed the houses and gardens on the east, while the ist Batn. 1 2th Regt., with portions of the 3rd Batn., was directed against the gas-works on the south of the station (3 p.m.). A fierce musketry engagement at short ranges now ensued. The enemy, who was probably aware of his numerical superiority, made an attack from the south, east, and west on the troops which held the gas-works and the embankment of the line to Beaugency. The 1 2th Regt. could only find scanty cover, and was literally overwhelmed with the hail of bullets ; and as if further demonstra tion of its unsheltered position were needed, it was exposed to a reverse fire from the houses of Les Aides and to the shells of our own artillery, which, passing over the village, menaced friend and foe alike. The losses increased every moment ; Major v. Tein fell, Major v. Kress and Captain Biirgel were severely wounded ; some of the companies of the 3rd Batn. 12 Regt., which were armed with Werder rifles, had completely expended their ammunition, and the men were exhausted and disheartened by the incessant fire. The main body of the Brigade, being itself engaged with the enemy, was unable to send any reinforcements to Colonel Narciss, * This company had been attached to Col. Narciss' column as a reinforcement, and to keep up the communications with the main body of the Brigade."], [161, "The Action and Occupation of Orleans. 153 in spite of his frequent applications for assistance, and he there fore ordered his troops to retire upon the station, which was held by one subdivision of the ist Batn. Rifles, and one comp.* 2nd Batn. 3rd Regt. Captain Berchem's company of the 4th Batn. Rifles, which we have already mentioned, had by this time arrived and placed itself at Colonel Narciss' disposal. It now covered the line of retreat. The troops maintained their position in the station and repulsed all attacks of the enemy. The main body of the 3rd Brigade had up to this moment made no progress whatever. Colonel Narciss' applications for assistance became more and more pressing ; the advance of the 4th Brigade had produced no apparent effect ; night was approaching, and Lieut.-Col. Muck, Chief of the Staff of the 2nd Inf. Div., was irresistibly forced to the same conclusion that had operated in the case of the ist column, namely, that a last effort must be made to seize Orleans before nightfall. The 2nd Brigade, which was very weak, constituted the last infantry reserve, and had taken up a position at Saran, ready to parry a possible repulse. At 4.30 P.M., almost at the same moment at which Maj. -General Dietl ordered the attack on Ormes, the battalions of the 3rd Brigade received the order to storm Les Aides, and with ringing cheers they pushed forward by the high road and from the east and west. Their apparent success lasted but for a moment ; the enemy, with whom a battalion of the Foreign Legion distinguished itself by its obstinate valour, defended each house and garden with a tenacity and an exasperation hardly ex ceeded even in the fight at Bazeilles ; the village was on fire in several places, but shots continued to be fired even from the midst of the flames. Some of the houses, which we passed under the im pression that they were in our hands, were still occupied by hidden inhabitants, who, as soon as our backs were turned, issued from their hiding-places and fired upon us. In spite of all exertions and losses we were unable to advance further than the church of Les Aides (5 p.m.). The 4th Brigade now began to produce some effect on the * This company had joined Col, Narciss' column, when the 2nd Batn. 3rd Regt. advanced against Les Aides."], [162, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 154 enemy, who yielded to its pressure on his line of retreat, and retired from Les Aides upon the Faubourg Bannier. The battalions of the 3rd Brigade, being forced to relinquish the attempt to penetrate into Les Aides, the 2nd Batn. 12th Regt, and portions of the 2nd Batn. 3rd Regt., were sent to support Colonel Narciss, who had meanwhile been reinforced by a company of the 3rd Batn. 12th Regt., and had again assumed the offensive. The ist Batn. 12th Regt, a company of the 4th Batn. Rifles, and the ioth and 12th comps. 3rd Batn. 12th Regt, advanced along the railway embankment, and the gas-works were taken for the second time at 5.30 p.m. This moment decided the fate of Orleans ; the suburbs were almost simultaneously attacked by the whole line, and the engagement after a short skirmish became a mere pursuit of flying groups of the enemy. General v. d. Tann, who had followed the 1st Regt, rode into Orleans through the Faubourg St. Jean at 6.30 P.M., accompanied by Lieut.-General v. Wittich. The town was wrapped in profound darkness ; every house was closed ; here and there a shot was heard fired at single fugitives, but no attempt was made by the inhabi tants to offer the slightest resistance. Gambetta's anticipations must have been bitterly disappointed by this apathetic resignation of the citizens of Orleans. General v. d. Tann on entering the town had some difficulty in ascertaining the general state of affairs, as no reports had been received from the 2nd and 3rd columns. The ist Regt. was posted on La Place Martroi ; the 13th Regt. and a few other detachments of the 4th Brigade had penetrated as far as La Place Bannier, and one batn. of the Body Guards was ordered to advance to the Mairie in the centre of the town. This battalion advanced through the dark and silent streets with band playing and drums beating, and was greeted at La Place Martroi by the ringing cheers of the ist Regt. The flames of the bivouack fires, which had been hastily kindled, lit up the martial groups, and the outlines of the gigantic statue * of * This statue of the \" Deliverer of France\" seems to have been held sacred by the inhabi tants of the town. Round the monument were hundreds of wreaths, which had been placed there in the pious belief that at the last moment Heaven would once more send help against the hated foe."], [163, "The Action and Occupation of Orleans. 155 the Maid of Orleans, which towered over the foreign soldiers, as they exulted in their victory. During the night the Ist Inf. Div. was ordered to occupy the suburb on the left bank of the Loire, the 2nd Inf. Div. the eastern part, and the 22nd Inf. Div. the western part of Orleans. As an immediate measure of precaution the 2nd Batn. 1st Regt. and Olivier's 6-pounder Battery were ordered to occupy the bridges over the Loire. The troops, which were somewhat dispersed, remained for the night in the positions in which the close of the engagement had left them. The ist Brigade was in Orleans. The 2nd Brigade in Saran. The 3rd Brigade in Les Aides, with the 12th Regt. at the rail way station. The 4th Brigade in Orleans and near Les Aides. The Cuirassier Brigade and Reserve Artillery bivouacked at Villeneuve. The 22nd Div. was partly at Orleans, partly at Ormes. The 4th Cavalry Division also bivouacked at Ormes. The losses of the day were as follows : \u2014 Bavarians. Killed, 10 officers, 108 men. Wounded, 30 \u201e 451 \u201e Missing, \u201e 78 \u201e 40 officers, 637 men.* Prussians. Killed, 3 officers, 29 men. Wounded, 14 \u201e 402 \u201e Missing, \u201e 75 \u201e 17 officers, 506 men.

Bavarian Army Corps. 156 the Bavarians, and of a total fighting strength of 3,975 bayonets lost 22 officers and 359 men, of whom 12 officers and 230 men belonged to the 3rd Regt. alone. The losses of the 4th Brigade amounted to 1 3 officers and 209 men. It has been frequently asserted, that the desperate attempt of the 3rd Brigade to occupy Les Aides was not absolutely necessary, as the defile of houses might have been taken from Les Aubrais or from the other side by the 4th Brigade. This assertion is not devoid of foundation ; but we must remember that a situation often assumes an entirely different aspect when we look back upon it ; on the afternoon in question, the authorities were forced to a different conclusion, and therefore adopted a different line of action. The disadvantages of the ground, and the way in which the vegetation impeded every movement and every attempt to survey the position or to act in concert, must not be forgotten. It was as impossible for the various columns to obtain an idea of the general state of the engagement, as for the battalions to effect rapid and collected movements from one point to the other. The cathedral of Orleans was the landmark towards which all the troops were directed. Should one of the three principal attacks upon Orleans prove successful, the resistance offered by the French to the other columns would be broken, for the loss of the town would endanger in no small degree the enemy's chances of retreat by the bridges over the Loire. At 4 p.m., when the 3rd Brigade was in possession of the northern houses of Bel Air, no firing was heard from the direction of Ormes, where the ist Brigade was deploying. The 4th Brigade was known, indeed, to be on the right and engaged in a sharp contest, but at what distance and in what direction could not be ascertained. (It was fighting its way with great difficulty through the vineyards, and eventually succeeded in completing its wheel.) From the left, pressing applications for assistance were continually received from Colonel Narciss. It was time to advance, if the cathedral, which could be seen in the distance, was to be reached before nightfall ; the other columns were apparently pausing, and perhaps awaiting the decisive ad vance of the 3rd Brigade on the Paris road, and our own weak ness would not permit us to send direct assistance to the hardly pressed troops at Les Aubrais."], [165, "The Action and Occupation of Orleans. 157 The foregoing facts combined to convince the Officer Com manding the 2nd Inf. Div. of the necessity of making _a final and desperate attempt to take Les Aides and to advance from that direction upon Orleans. Similar motives induced General v. d. Tann and his staff to use all the available forces of the ist column to obtain possession of the town before nightfall. The musketry fire on the left wing increased every moment in intensity, and General v. d. Tann hastened the advance of the ist Brigade, while Lieut-Col. Heinleth led the 32nd Prussian Regt. and the ist Regt. against the railway embankment and the suburbs, being persuaded that this step would most effectually help the other columns. It would be unjust to the leaders and the brave troops to judge the intentions, which were the same in the case of both the ist and 3rd columns, by their results, which proved different. The city of Joan of Arc looked somewhat dreary on the 12th of October. The squares and boulevards had been turned into bivouacks, and the soldiers had contrived to appropriate any cooking utensils that they fancied from the neighbouring houses. Crowds of the lower classes had assembled at the Mairie when we entered on the preceding evening, but now some of the more respectable inhabitants made their appearance and viewed us with no very friendly glance. The \" Barbarians,\" as they called us, were certainly not in review order after the long marches, the wet weather, and two days of continuous fighting ; but, on the other hand, both Bavarians and Thuringians were quiet and inoffensive in their demeanour, and any excess was at once put down and severely punished. General v. d. Tann appointed Lieut.-Col. v. Heuduck (in com mand of the 13th Prussian Hussars) Commandant of Orleans. This distinguished and energetic officer, whose name is connected in the most honourable manner with all the actions in which the 22nd Div. took part, had already filled a similar post at Sedan, under more trying circumstances. He at once assumed a deter mined attitude, and in a very short time all the measures inevitable in an occupied town, such as requisitions, confiscation of arms, and street repairs, were set on foot without any opposition. While Lieut.-Col. v. Heuduck was taking the necessary precau-"], [166, "158 The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. tions for the internal arrangements of the town, General v. d. Tann turned his attention more especially to regaining the touch of the enemy, and to procuring accurate information concerning the direction of his retreat. The inhabitants of the suburb of St. Mar ceau, on the left bank of the Loire, stated that the main body of the enemy had retired along the road to Salbris. The accounts of his probable force were naturally at variance,* but after some time we ascertained that we had been engaged with the 15 th Corps, numbering about 30,000 men, and consisting partly of regulars and troops from Algiers, and partly of mobilised National Guards. In the course of October 12th, the Army was distributed as follows : \u2014 The 22nd Inf. Div. was located in the western part of Orleans. The 4th Cav. Div. had its 8th Brigade cantoned in St. Sigis mond and its neighbourhood, the 9th in Patay, and the ioth in St. Peravy and Tournoisis ; while the 5th Regt. of Dragoons, with two guns, had been detached to St. Ay and Meung-sur- Loire. The 2nd Cav. Div. was ordered to advance to the left bank of the Loire, and to furnish the outposts, patrols, and scouts towards the south. It left its quarters about Trinay that afternoon, and reached the suburbs on the left bank of the Loire at 10 p.m. The 2nd Brigade of the 1st Inf. Div. had advanced as far as Olivet, while the ist Brigade was cantoned in the Faubourg St. Marceau. The 2nd Inf. Div. was quartered in the eastern part of Orleans, with an advance guard (ist and 2nd Batns. 12th Regt., one 4-pounder Battery) in the Faubourg Bourgoinge. The Reserve Artillery, which had entered the town in the after noon, was posted on the Boulevards, and the men and horses were billeted on the nearest houses. The Cuirassier Brigade was cantoned in Coinces, Chene, Rommilly, Villardu, and Brilly. On the morning of the 13th of October the touch of the enemy was regained. The head of the 2nd Brigade came upon the * The contents of the mail-bags, which we took possession of, gave very complete and interesting details as to the morale and the flight of the defeated Army Several of the letters were written while the battle was actunlly raging, and others after the retreat had begun.

The patrols of the 4th Cavalry Division (ioth Cavalry Brigade) came into collision with Franc-tireurs in the neighbourhood of Chateaudun, but no French troops were to be seen either in Meung sur-Loire or Beaugency. On the evening of Oct. 13th, an orderly officer belonging to the headquarter staff, Capt. v. d. Lanken, arrived from Versailles with despatches, which directed General v. d. Tann to extend the operations of his Army and of the 2nd Cav. Div, which was now placed under his command, as far as Bourges. It appeared to be of the greatest importance, with a view to the future, to obtain possession of this town and to destroy its large gun manufactories. Simultaneously with the advance against Bourges, a demonstra tion was to be made against Tours, the seat of the Government ; and, finally, it was mentioned in the despatches, that the only depot of military wagons still in the hands of the French was at Chateauroux. It was, however, left to General v. d. Tann to act according to his own judgment, as the state of affairs could not be sufficiently well known at Versailles. The stakes were high, and it is therefore all the more necessary to enumerate the reasons, that induced General v. d. Tann not to undertake the operations against Bourges, but to sacrifice his feelings as a General to his duties as an independent Commander. The strength of the Army, when it commenced its march to Orleans, may be estimated at 21,000 bayonets; but the numbers had been reduced to 19,000 bayonets at the outside by the losses in the two engagements, by the detachments which had been sent away to escort prisoners, and by sick and casualties of every description. The fact, that Chateaudun and Chartres were occupied by the French, rendered it all the more necessary to hold Orleans, but this and the demonstration against Tours could not be accom plished by cavalry alone. At least one brigade (about 4,000 men) would have to be left in the town, leaving a force of about 15,000 infantry for further operations. The peculiar proportion of the three arms, viz., 21,000 infantry, 6,700 cavalry, and 160 guns, could be advantageously employed in La Beauce and the ground between Etampes and Orleans against"], [168, "160 77/i? Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. a numerous but ill-trained infantry, but this would not be the case in the tract of country which must be traversed and perhaps conquered between Orleans and Bourges. The country between the Loire and the Cher is covered with large and small woods. The general direction of the latter is from east to west, and they form, as it were, so many parallel lines of defence. It is unnecessary for an enemy to man\u0153uvre on such ground ; he need only make use of its capabilities and follow the natural instinct of resistance, in order to exhaust his adversary, unless the latter can at once and permanently break down his opposition by numerical superiority. In this labyrinth of lakes, woods, and numerous brooks, the French could offer a most obstinate resistance without well-trained troops ; all that was needed was large numbers, even if only half trained, and of these the French had more than enough. To mass our artillery or to threaten the enemy's flanks by large bodies of cavalry, as at Artenay, was not practicable between Orleans and Bourges; an open range was wanting for the one, and a sufficient space in which to man\u0153uvre for the other. Both arms were restricted to the roads, and the heaviest task fell upon the infantry. The distance from Orleans to Bourges is 75 English miles, at least five days' march. To the north of La Fertd St. Aubin were the enemy's outposts, and we might therefore expect to encounter opposition as soon as we reached that place, which was only 12 miles from Orleans, an opposition which would increase with every mile we traversed. It may be asked in what state and in what strength would the infantry have reached Bourges after five days' marching and incessant fighting. It had been ascertained from trustworthy sources, that field works had been constructed at Bourges and armed with heavy guns ; the excited peasants and the workmen from the factories were armed and ready for resistance ; reinforcements, even though untrained, could daily and hourly be brought up by rail from Tours and the South, to increase the numbers of the garrison ; and we had been taught by experience at Orleans, that the enemy's nfantry distinguished itself by its obstinate defence of buildings and earthworks. It would hardly have been safe, under such circumstances, to"], [169, "The Action and Occupation of Orleans. 161 reckon upon a successful issue of the contest ; and yet without a complete and brilliant success the situation of the Army, five days' march from Orleans and four more marches from the Army of Investment, and therefore at least 150 miles from any assist ance, would have been most precarious. The lines of communication could only be guarded by cavalry, and they would have found their task almost impossible in country such as that to the south of the Loire. The success must be so complete, that a retrograde movement towards the Loire, whether to Gien, Orleans, or Blois, could not have the appearance of being forced upon us, as otherwise the enemy would materially gain in morale* The general position of affairs was critical. At that time (the beginning of October), it seemed probable that the enemy, ex hausted by the uninterrupted success of the Germans, would be in clined for peace. The self-confidence of the French was obviously on the wane, and in some cases had been succeeded by a feeling of total despair ; but a single victory, or even an engage ment not followed by a declared defeat, might completely re volutionize the state of feeling and renew the disinclination to submission. In November, after Coulmiers, we had an example of the way in which the French, at first half-despairing and then astonished at their own success, banished the memory of their past losses in renewed self-glorification. In November, the categorical order, that \" Orleans was only to be evacuated in the presence of very superior forces of the enemy,\" forced General v. d. Tann to fight, in order to prove that the enemy was really very superior in numbers ; but in October it was left to his discretion to act according to circumstances, and, as an independent and responsible leader, he was impelled to a different course of action to that pursued in November, when he acted in obedience to superior authority. The expedition against Bourges might possibly succeed, but in our situation it would have been rash to risk all on one move, and, * The author did not see the works of the French Minister of War and of General D'Aurelles until after the above lines were written. They completely justify the conclusions arrived at in the headquarters at Orleans, and which we have transcribed almost literally. On our arrival at Bourges, we should have had to encounter the 15th and 16th Corps, the Franc-tireurs and other bands raised in the South, altogether from 70,000 to So, 000 armed foes. M"], [170, "162 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. tempting as the prize was, it hardly seemed adequate to the stakes.* These various reasons induced General v. d. Tann not to con tinue the operations further to the south. In the course of the next few days, the cavalry patrols on the south of the Loire came upon small detachments of the enemy along the line from La Ferte St. Aubin to Vannes. The 2nd Cav. Div. incessantly reconnoitred the country about Clery, St. Laurent-des-Eaux, Ligny, La Ferte St. Aubin, Vannes, and Sully. Lieut-General v. Stolberg's Cavalry Division performed most ex cellent service, more especially during the occupation of Orleans between the departure of the 22nd Inf. Div. and the 4th Cav. Div. and the engagement of Coulmiers. The extent of country, that had to be watched, was so great that without the Cavalry Division the Army Corps in Orleans would have been useless ; but Stolberg's Division, with the assistance of our Cuirassiers and Lt. Cavalry, succeeded in ascertaining all the movements of the enemy, and prevented his passing a certain line. The Cuirassier Brigade was stationed on the left bank in St. Jean-le-Blanc, St. Denis-en-Val and Olivet, to support Stolberg's Division ; while the 2nd Brigade, which had been pushed forward, was reinforced by the 2nd Batn. Rifles and Hutten's 6-pounder Battery. On the right bank of the Loire, the patrols of the 4th Cav. Div. came daily into collision with Franc-tireurs and armed peasants. We had been taught by experience that these minor hostilities invariably indicated the presence of large bodies of French troops in the neighbourhood, and we therefore concluded, almost with certainty, that Chateaudun and its neighbourhood was occupied by the French. The patrols were constantly fired on by the inhabitants of Varize, and it was proved that the latter were in close communica tion with the neighbouring bands of Franc-tireurs. As threats of reprisals proved of no avail, the 9th Cavalry Brigade, one Battery * The distance from Orleans to Bourges seemed to justify the expectation that our advance would be known to the enemy in time to enable him, not only to bring up reinforcements to Bourges, but also to clear the military workshops and to place the mal&ricl in safety, whereby one of the chief aims of the operation would be defeated."], [171, "The Action and Occupation of Orleans. 163 of Horse Artillery, and a detachment of Bavarian Infantry, were despatched against the village on Oct 15th and set fire to it. A detachment of the 22nd Inf. Div. (three squadrons of the 13th Regt. of Hussars, three comps. ist Batn. 94th Regt.) had been stationed at Les Aides since Oct. 12th, and reported on the 15th that the French had sent a locomotive from Beaugency to Baulle, and were taking measures to repair the injured portions of the line. On Oct. 16th, a detachment of Prussian Engineers was despatched to destroy the bridge and railway at Beaugency. General v. d. Tann had reported that an advance upon Bourges was not advisable under existing circumstances, and orders arrived from Versailles, Oct. 16th, that the 22nd Inf. Div. and the 4th Cav. Div. should return to their former districts via Chateaudun and Chartres, while the I. Corps and the 2nd Cav. Div. should remain in Orleans and put the town in a state of defence, espe cially against an attack from the south. After the departure of the 4th Cav. Div., the outpost duty on the west towards Blois and the Forest of Marchenoir devolved on the 2nd Cav. Div. Lieut-General v. Stolberg moved, on the 17th of Oct., with the 3rd and 5th Cavalry Brigades to the right bank of the Loire, and took up cantonments on the following day, extending from St. Ay by Huisseau-sur-Mauve to Coulmiers. On the left wing two battalions of the 12th Bavarian Regt. were stationed in support on the Loire. The line of outposts of these two brigades extended from L'Ormeteau by Le Grand Lus, La Renardiere and Rondon neau to La Nivelle, while patrols penetrated several miles further westwards. The general position of the I. Corps was but little altered. The ist Inf. Div. was charged with the task of covering the bridges over the Loire, the 2 nd Brigade was to scour the left bank, and to act as a support to the 4th Prussian Cavalry Brigade (consisting of the ist and 5th Hussars, and commanded by General v. Barnekow), which had remained here on outpost duty. The 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Inf. Div. occupied that part of the town which had been evacuated by the 22nd Inf. Div., and detached, as above mentioned, two battalions to support the 2nd Cav. Div. The 4th Brigade was as hitherto to undertake the outpost duty on the east, to patrol the line of the canal (Canal d'Orleans) with M 2"], [172, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 164 the 4th Lt. Cav. Regt, and to reconnoitre in the direction of the Bois d'Orleans. At noon on the 17th of October, the 22nd Inf. Div. left Orleans, and the 4th Cav. Div. its cantonments, and commenced the march to Chateaudun. At Lieut.-Gen. v. Wittich's request, one 6-pounder Battery (Olivier's) had been detached from the Reserve Artillery to the 22nd Inf. Div. On the 17th of October, the I. Corps entered upon the occupa tion of Orleans, which lasted for three weeks, and which was re garded by the uninitiated as a time of rest and recreation. Those who were there will have some difficulty in recalling more than a few days which at all answer to that description. The general situation appeared so doubtful and uncertain, that it was not till the beginning of November, when M. Thiers was negotiating in Paris, that we could even think of sending for the officers' baggage, &c, which had been at some distance in rear ever since the march from Longjumeau on Oct. 6th. It was a long time before the effects of this so-called rest in Orleans ceased to be felt by some of the troops, more especially by Maj. -General v. Orff's battalions and General v. Barnekow's Hussars, upon whom the severe outpost duty on the left bank of the Loire devolved, and by the Cuirassier Brigade, which hardly passed a day, from October 20th to November 9th, without an alarm. General v. Werder's situation at Dijon, at a later period of the war, was as problematical as that of General v. d. Tann at Orleans. Both had advanced with their armies far into the enemy's country, and forced him to concentrate his recently mobilised forces to repulse them, thus disclosing his strength and furnishing a definite object against which the Commander-in-Chief could direct a crushing blow. On the 1 8th of October, Lieut-General v. Wittich attacked Chateaudun, and took possession of the town on the following night after a hard contest. Olivier's 6-pounder Battery, which had been attached to the 22nd Inf. Div., was of the greatest service on this occasion. Two other Batteries (Malaise's 6-pounder Battery, and Mayr's 12-pounder Battery), which had been sent to Chateaudun on Oct. 19th at Gen. v. Wittich's request, arrived too late to be of service."], [173, "77^ Action and Occupation of Orleans. 165 From spies and other sources we learnt that large bodies of the enemy's troops were concentrated at Gien, either with the intention of attacking Orleans from the east, or of advancing against Fontainebleau by Montargis. The latter movement would have seriously affected the position of the I. Corps in Orleans. In forwarding the reports from Gien, General v. d. Tann requested that, in case the French attempted to surround and attack Orleans, he should be allowed to abandon the position at Orleans, which was extremely unfavourable from a military point of view, and to take up a position in the neighbourhood of Pithiviers, where the ground was better adapted to the use of cavalry and artillery. The reports from Gien led to the choice of the latter place. Various reasons, however, rendered the continued occupation of Orleans indispensable, and a despatch, received on Oct. 20th from the Officer Commanding the III. Army at Versailles, ordered that the I. Corps was to remain in Orleans, and the town only to be evacuated in the presence of far superior French forces. Intelligence was received that the French troops, that had been seen at Gien, had retired, but the reconnoitring parties on the south came into daily collision with the enemy and generally suffered some loss. The approach and activity of the enemy on the west also became apparent ; and in order to prepare for an attack on that side, the following orders were issued on the 22nd of October : \u2014 The Ist Inf. Div. will garrison Orleans and will occupy the quays and entrances. One batn., two squadrons, and two guns will advance to Point-aux-Moines and cover the canal. One batn., half a squadron, and two guns will occupy Loury and Fay-aux-Loges, and watch the Bois d'Orleans. The 2nd Brigade and the 4th Cavalry Brigade will continue to reconnoitre on the south, and will cover Orleans on that side. The 2nd Inf. Div. will take up a position behind the Mauve brook, against an attack from the west, and behind the railway embankment, against an attack from the south. Of the 2nd Inf. Div., the 3rd Brigade will occupy St. Ay, La Chapelle, Faubourg St. Jean, and St. Laurent, and the 4th Brigade, Ormes, Coulmicrs, St. Peravy, Ingre, and Faubourg Bannier."], [174, "166 The Operations of the i.

The beginning of the end seemed to be at hand."], [175, "167 CHAPTER XIV NOVEMBER. On the 28th of October, Thiers passed the outposts and arrived at Orleans. On the following day he continued his journey to Versailles, accompanied by an orderly officer of General v. d. Tann's staff. From Versailles he went to Paris, to make himself acquainted with the state of popular opinion there, to render an account of his unsuccessful expedition to the European Courts, and to endeavour to obtain an armistice, which was urgently needed by France in general, and more especially by Paris. The news brought by Thiers to Paris was not of a very cheerful nature. His diplomatic negotiations with the foreign powers had been unsuccessful ; and besides this negative result, he was the bearer of the unwelcome news that Metz had fallen, and that Bazaine and his whole Army were prisoners of war. During the progress of the negotiations between Paris and Versailles, much activity was visible among the troops in the neighbourhood of Orleans, and everything appeared to indicate that, as soon as the failure of M. Thiers' mission was announced, a serious collision would take place. It is doubtful whether the mission of the accomplished diplomatist was not all along a mere feint, with the object of gaining time and lulling us into a feeling of security. The French themselves took good care that the latter object should not be attained. On the very day on which Thiers passed through Orleans, it was ascertained with certainty, that from the 25th to the 29th of October, the regular traffic on the lines between Bourges and Tours, and Tours and Le Mans, had been suspended, and the lines wholly occupied with the transport of troops, that Count"], [176, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 168 Keratry had collected a Corps of \" Mobiles \" at La Val, that Chatelineau had undertaken the command of the Franc-tireurs on the left bank of the Loire, and that the French officers openly discussed an impending resumption of hostilities. This information came from trustworthy sources, and was at once telegraphed to headquarters. General v. d. Tann also obtained information from spies, that French troops of the line were assembling at Gien, Salbris, and Argent. On October 31st, the enemy made a reconnaissance in force towards Verdes from the direction of Cloyes, whereby the alarm was given to some of our troops. Of the 3rd Brigade,* the ist and 2nd Batns. 3rd Regt, one squadron 4th Lt. Cav. Regt., and Daffner's Division of Artillery, which had been attached to the 2nd Inf. Div., moved to Huisseau-sur-Mauve, the ist Batn. 12th Regt. to Changy, and the ist Batn. Rifles to Baccon, where towards evening the whole Brigade was concentrated. The 4th Brigades marched to Coulmiers ; but as the Heavy Brigade of the 2nd Cav. Div., which had advanced to Ouzouer-le- Marche, reported that the enemy had retired, the 4th Brigade returned to its former quarters. The ist Inf. Div. and the remainder of the Reserve Artillery were held in readiness to march at Orleans. Several French battalions and a few cavalry regiments showed themselves, but retired in the evening in a westerly direction. The company and a half that formed the garrison of the village of St. Peravy-la-Colombe, on the road to Chateaudun, seemed hardly strong enough to secure the place, and this important point was therefore occupied by the whole of the ist Batn. 13th Regt. A squadron was despatched daily to Chateaudun by the Cuiras sier Brigade, which was cantoned at Peravy on the right of the 2nd Cav. Div., and it also maintained communications with the 22nd Div. at Chartres by Orgeres. General v. d.

X By Versailles."], [177, "November. 169 tion with the Officer Commanding the latter Division ; for, although fifty miles apart, their respective forces were so situated that the one must feel the effects of any attack on the other. Lieut-General v. Wittich's Division, with the 4th and 6th Cav. Divs., had to secure the Army of Investment against an attack from the direction of Le Mans. By means of continual and careful reconnaissances, he ascertained that the enemy had occupied for longer or shorter periods the whole line from Illiers by Courville, Chateauneuf-en-Thymerais and Dreux to Anet. The reports received from Lieut-General v. Wittich, the sub stance of which was forwarded to Orleans, the news concerning the transport of troops by the line from Tours to Le Mans, and the pressure exercised by considerable forces of the enemy from the direction of Rouen towards Mantes, impressed the German leaders with the belief that an attack on Versailles was more imminent than one on Orleans. Versailles, the seat of the German headquarters and the key of the chain of investment, was of such pre-eminent importance, that it was easy to foresee that, while the German troops, which were no longer required at Metz, were rapidly advancing from the east, the French army would make a last desperate attack on Versailles from the west, from the direction either of Le Mans or Rouen. At that moment the general state of affairs was, however, by no means so clearly defined, as to enable the German authorities to make a definite disposition of the inconsiderable forces, that remained at trreir disposal after deducting the Army of Field- Marshal Prince Frederick Charles, which was on the march. It was, indeed, a critical period, and any prolongation of it was viewed with impatience at Versailles. We, meanwhile, at our post in Orleans, far away to the south, awaited in suspense the final and decisive moment. It daily became more obvious that the enemy intended to strike a blow ; the general situation of the I. Corps had not improved, and the only assistance which could be reckoned upon was that of the 22nd Division from Chartres, and that only if the latter was not attacked itself. Amid all the uncertainty, only one thing was clear to General v. d. Tann, namely, that he could not give up Orleans without a battle, for it had been explicitly stated in the despatches from"], [178, "The Operations of tlie i. Bavarian Army Corps. 170 Versailles, that \" Orleans was only to be evacuated in the presence of a very superior enemy.\" On the 4th of November, the position of the enemy, according to the reports which had been received, was as follows : \u2014 All the country between Moree and Mer was strongly occupied by the enemy, and one brigade was at Mer, posted on both banks of the Loire. Considerable bodies of Gardes Mobiles and Franc-tireurs were in the Forest of Marchenoir, and in rear of it were troops of the Line, infantry, and cavalry. Small detachments of the enemy, consisting of troops of the Line and Gardes Mobiles, had shown themselves on the left bank of the Loire, while at Gien and Montargis there appeared to be nothing but bands of Franc-tireurs. General v. d. Tann considered himself obliged, for the following reasons, to restrict himself to the extended reconnaissances of the 2nd Cav. Div. It would take at least a day's march to reach the zone occupied by the French, and in order that a reconnaissance in force might be able to force its way even momentarily into the enemy's position, and that the undertaking should not assume the appear ance of an unsuccessful offensive movement, it would be necessary to have reserves at hand. In other words, a large portion of the Army Corps would have to be employed. It would hardly have been advisable to despatch considerable forces from the central position at Orleans on an expedition which would occupy several days, especially in our uncertainty as to the probable direction of the enemy's attack. Besides, when the object of such a reconnaissance had been gained, it would inva riably be followed by a return to the original position, a circum stance which, in the present instance, would have been regarded by our enemy as an acknowledgment and a token of defeat. How completely General v. d. Tann was justified in the above views, is proved by the French accounts * of the reconnaissance engagement at Chantome.f General v. d. Tann was determined not to give up Orleans without a struggle, but he did not wish to waste the strength of his infantry, which was already weak, in minor undertakings, or to help to convince the enemy of his numerical superiority. * Chanzy. t Called the Battle of Valliere by the French."], [179, "November. 171 On the 5th of November, a staff officer of General v. d. Tann's Corps, who had been sent to the French outposts in order to convey a private telegram to Madame Thiers, remarked that barri cades and trenches were being constructed on the road between Beaugency and Mer, and saw detachments of the 39th Regt. of the Line and of the 6th Hussars, the main bodies of which were in Mer. We also learnt, from trustworthy sources, that considerable bodies of the enemy were being concentrated between Blois and Mer. Everything appeared to indicate that the main attack would be from the west, probably in combination with one from the south ; for at the beginning of November our scouts had come upon French troops of the Line on the left bank of the Loire, in the neighbourhood of Lailly and Jouy-le-Pothier. The squadron of the Cuirassier Brigade, which was daily sent to reconnoitre in the direction of Chateaudun, had hitherto found that place free from any of the enemy's troops, but on the 6th of November a squadron of the 2nd Cuir. Regt. was received with a brisk volley from the farms near the town. After losing 1 1 men it retreated, and was fired upon by the inhabitants of several villages which it passed through. These hostilities, occurring as they did in villages where our troops and scouts were habitually viewed with indifference, were an unmistakable indication of the vicinity of considerable forces of the enemy. The population, irritated and rendered fanatical by the pressure of war, seemed unable to restrain the expression of its hostility, and thus was the means of affording valuable information to the leaders of the German army. Lieut. -General v. Stolberg's Division, to the activity of which we were principally indebted for accurate reports, was able by an extended reconnaissance to ascertain the existence of considerable French forces, composed of all three arms, posted in and in rear of the Forest of Marchenoir. During the reconnaisance made on the 19th, 21st, 22nd, and 25th* of October, by portions of the 2nd Cav. Div. in conjunction * The object of this expedition was to punish the villages of Binas and Cravant, the inhabitants of which had shot some Hussars. The fact that Bavarian troops were often selected to carry out these acts of retaliation, secured the doubtful honour to the Bavarians in general, and to v. der Tann's Corps in particular, of being designated the Dreaded Incendiaries."], [180, "The Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. 172 with some detachments of Bavarian infantry, the enemy's out posts had usually been passive and in observation, but this ceased to be the case at the beginning of November, when French cavalry ventured almost up to our line of outposts. In order to ascertain, as far as possible, any changes in the position of the enemy, Lieut-General v. Stolberg, with General v. d. Tann's approval, undertook a more extended reconnaissance in the direction of the Forest of Marchenoir. This expedition was to have taken place on Nov. 5th, but was obliged to be postponed, for General v. d. Tann had despatched a parlementaire to the French outposts with the telegram to M. Thiers, and it would have been opposed to his military prin ciples for a parlementaire to cross the line of French outposts at one point while an attack was being made upon them at another. Lieut-General v. Stolberg ordered the reconnaissance to be made on the 7th of November, and made the following dispo sitions : \u2014 \u25a0 The ist column, consisting of the 3rd Batn. 13th Regt.,* a Regt. of Hussars, and a Battery, will advance by Ouzouer-le-Marche towards Binas and Chantome. The 2nd column will march by Baccon and Mezieres towards Chantome. The head of this column will consist of one Regt. of Hussars, one Battery, and thirty Riflemen, and will be followed at a distance of 1 y2 English miles by one Regt. of Lancers and 2y2 comps. ist Batn. Rifles. The Reserve, consisting of the Cuirassier Regt. of Body Guards, the Cuirassier Brigade, and two Batteries, will take up a position on the east of Baccon. The outposts will maintain their present positions and watch the country towards Blois. * In the orders dated Nov. 4th, the 7th Batn. Rifles was mentioned, but it had meanwhile been relieved by the 3rd Batn. 13th Regt. The latter had only a fighting strength of three companies."], [181, "173 CHAPTER XV RECONNAISSANCE AND ENGAGEMENT OF CHANTOME. {November 7th.) The 2nd column, which was accompanied by Lieut-General v. Stolberg, arrived at Chantome at 10 A.M. The village had been deserted by the enemy, but we were fired upon from several houses by the inhabitants. This opposition having been quickly overcome, two squadrons of Lancers, two guns, and thirty rifle men advanced towards Marolles, which appeared to be occupied. A few well-directed shells soon made the enemy retire in haste towards the wood. At this time, about n A.M., intelligence was received that French cavalry was visible to the south of Villermain, and the Reserve at Baccon was ordered to send detachments in that direction. The ist column had reached Ouzouer-le-Marche at 10 a.m. and continued its march to Binas, without encountering any oppo sition. Thence it proceeded to Chantome, which it reached at noon. In order to continue the movement and to induce the enemy to disclose his strength, the 3rd Batn. 13th Regt. (Capt. Haag), one Regt. of Hussars, and one Battery, were ordered to advance from Chantome to Valliere. The latter place had, meanwhile, been occupied by the 2nd comp, ist Batn. Rifles (Lieut.-Colonel Schmidt). During the march towards Valliere, strong detachments of the enemy were observed to debouch from the forest in the direction of St. Laurent-des-Bois. (This was Bourdillon's Brigade, which had been ordered by the Officer Commanding the 16th Corps"], [182, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 174 to advance in support of the 3rd Batn. Rifles and the Franc tireurs.) In consequence of this offensive movement on the part of the enemy, which enabled him to make use of his guns and mitrail leuses, the 3rd Batn. 13th Regt. was ordered to occupy the ground between Valliere and Marolles. The Battalion took up a position on the edge of a rise which slopes down to the wood of Marchenoir, and the whole was quickly brought under fire, to defend the extensive position, and to prevent the enemy from breaking through our line of defence. A company of the ist Batn. Rifles was stationed in each of the villages of Valliere and Marolles, while two batteries had taken up a position between Marolles and the left wing of the 3rd Batn. 13th Regt., and were directing their fire upon the enemy's columns, which were advancing under cover of a cloud of skirmishers ; the Regt. of Lancers covered the extreme left flank on the south of Marolles, one Regt. of Hussars had taken up a position on the right flank, and one Regt. of Hussars was in reserve on the east of Marolles. The contest was continued for some time in this formation, but the enemy's infantry was far superior in numbers to our own, and in the bearing, as well as the handling, of his troops there was a marked improvement over all the detachments, with which we had come into collision at the outposts since the occupation of Orleans. The 3rd Batn. 13th Regt., which was far from strong, soon found itself in a most critical position ; the enemy directed his principal fire against it, and threatened it with an attack, which the thin line of skirmishers would hardly have been able to with stand. This unequal contest lasted for more than an hour ; it was im possible for the infantry to assume the offensive, and it was obliged to be contented with resisting the overwhelming pressure of the enemy ; an advance of the other two arms was, under the circumstances, equally impracticable ; and on receipt of the intelli gence that columns of the enemy's cavalry * were advancing on * On the 7th of November, this cavalry, consisting of the 4th Regt. Dragoons and 4th Lt. Cav. Kegt., under General Abdelal, was on the march to Verdes, whence it was to reconnoitre our outposts. When the General reached Verdes, he heard the sound of cannon, retraced his steps, and sent the 4th Dragoons on towards Valliere."], [183, "Reconnaissance and Engagement of Chantome. 175 the north of Valliere, and threatening the infantry's line of re treat, General v. Stolberg issued an order to break off the engage ment. The open nature of the ground, which was exposed to the fire of the enemy's guns, rendered it extremely difficult for the in fantry to carry out the above order, and entailed heavy losses before the protection of the Hussars could be reached. The enemy merely kept up an artillery and infantry fire at long ranges, and the reconnoitring detachment withdrew without any difficulty by Chantome to Ouzouer-le-Marche. The aim of the expedition was attained, but had been dearly bought. On the enemy's side, about eight battalions of the Line,* two batteries of artillery and some mitrailleuses had been seen, the sudden appearance and whole bearing of which clearly proved that considerable forces must be present in reserve, and that we had to deal with organised troops under skilful leaders. The losses of the Bavarian infantry, which were considerable, were as follows : \u2014 Killed, i officer, 27 men. Wounded, 2 officers, 49 \u201e Missing, \u2014 \u201e 64 \u201e 3 officers, 140 men. The 3rd Batn. 13th Regt., which had set out with three com panies, numbering about 400 men, lost 3 officers and 123 men; the ist Batn. Rifles {2% comps.) lost 17 men. We were unfortunately obliged to leave the wounded in the hands of the enemy. We have already mentioned that the Reserve, which was sta tioned at Baccon, had received an order at noon to send out detachments to the south of Villermain. The 2nd Regt. of Cuirassiers (Col. Baumuller), and one Battery of Horse Artillery (Hellingrath), advanced at a rapid pace to Cravant, where, nothing being seen of the enemy, the detachment turned to the north and found an opportunity at Villessiclair of bringing the * Bourdillon's Brigade had advanced to Changy, and consisted of 7 battalions, in addition to which there were the 3rd Batn.

Stolberg immediately after the engagement."], [184, "The Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. 176 battery into play upon the right flank of the enemy's posi tion. Later, when the main body of the Reserve received the order to advance, the engagement at Chantome was already over. The fact, that this place was unoccupied by the enemy, showed that he had made no preparations for pursuit. Although the object of ascertaining the enemy's strength and position had been attained, it must be acknowledged that the French had also gained a material advantage, which consisted not so much in the natural result that the weak reconnoitring force was compelled to retire before a superior enemy, as in the fact that a portion of the newly-formed French Army had been able to drive back by its superior strength a German detachment con sisting of all three arms. The moral effect of this otherwise unimportant engagement at Chantome was of considerable importance to the French. Chanzy speaks of it in the following terms : \" Ce combat de Valliere etait le premier engagement serieux de l'arm^e reunie sur la rive droite de la Loire ; il fut un veritable succes et eut sur nos jeunes troupes une grande influence.\" Before the news of the engagement had reached General v. d. Tann, intelligence had been received, that on that day (November 7th) a patrol of the 4th Lt. Cav. Regt. had been attacked by the inhabitants of Beaugency, and had escaped with some loss. Our patrols had hitherto traversed this place without any opposition, and this sudden outbreak of hostility was easily interpreted. There was yet another circumstance, which seemed to indicate that a general attack was in preparation, and that the government at Tours was only awaiting the return of Thiers, who arrived in Orleans from Versailles on the evening of November 7th. Gene ral v. d. Tann had accidentally learnt that General d'Aurelles, who was in command of the French forces on the Loire, had his head quarters in the neighbourhood of Mer, not quite two days' march from Orleans. The vicinity of the Commander-in-Chief was a sure sign of an impending offensive movement, but the direction of the main attack was not sufficiently indicated to enable us to form a definite plan. All the detachments of the Corps received orders to hold them selves in readiness to march at a moment's notice. By 6 A.M. all"], [185, "Reconnaissance and Engagement of C/iantome. 177 the men were to have had a hot breakfast, and they were to carry with them one day's rations of cooked meat in addition to the usual supply. On the morning of November 8th, the 3rd Brigade reported from St. Ay, that during the past night patrols of the 12th Regiment, which had advanced towards Meung, had come upon cavalry and infantry patrols belonging to the enemy, and had exchanged shots with them. The French columns had apparently approached nearer to Orleans. Thiers had left in the forenoon for Tours, and had been escorted as far as the French outposts by one of General v. d. Tann's orderly officers. This officer on his return brought back the news, that he had been stopped by French outposts on the east of Meung, and that the road there had been broken up and barricaded. Finally, reports were received in the afternoon, both from the Cuirassier Brigade and from the 2nd Cav. Div., which threw light on the situation and enabled us to form a definite plan. About noon the outposts of the Cuirassier Brigade observed several French Cavalry regiments, which took up a position between Prenouvellon and Grange Favelles, and placed outposts a few hours later (2.30 P.M.) from Favelles to Ouzouer-le-Marche. The Cuirassier Brigade was concentrated at Peravy, the castle park was occupied by the ist Batn. 13th Regt, and the report was quickly despatched to Orleans. The advanced patrols of the 2nd Cav. Div. had also observed the approach of the enemy. At Charsonville strong detachments both of artillery and infantry had been seen, and late in the after noon reports were received that a column composed of all three arms had marched from Ouzouer in the direction of Baccon, and that Le Bardon was occupied by a strong force of French infantry. On receipt of the first reports, between 3 and 4 p.m., the fol lowing orders were issued, with the object of detaining the enemy in case he should continue his offensive movement that day, at any rate until the cavalry, which had been pushed on in advance, could rejoin us. The 3rd Brigade was to be concentrated, and to take up con fined cantonments in Huisseau, Chaingy, and St. Ay. On the first receipt of the information that the enemy was N"], [186, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. \u25a0i78 advancing in force, the 7th Batn. Rifles, and 2nd and 3rd Batns. 13th Regt., two squadrons 4th Lt. Cavalry Regt. and one Battery, had been detached from the 4th Brigade to Rosieres ; the remainder of the Brigade stood in readiness at Ormes. The three above mentioned battalions spent the night at Rosieres. It was well known that the French were present on the west of Orleans, and along the whole line from Prenouvellon by Ouzouer-le-Marche as far as the Loire ; and the supposition that considerable hostile forces were assembled on the south of Orleans seemed equally well sounded, and was confirmed not only by the fact that our patrols were constantly in contact with French troops of the Line at Vannes, Jouy-le-Pothier, and Lailly, but also by spies, on whom reliance could be placed, and by the conviction that the French would seek to detain the Army Corps in Orleans. The object of the enemy, namely, to surround and attack Orleans from all sides, and to cut off the retreat of the Army to Paris, was made sufficiently evident on the afternoon of November 8th. In reflecting on the measures to be taken in the course of the next few hours, one idea was constantly present in General v. d. Tann's mind, viz. to follow the orders from Versailles, and not to give up Orleans without a struggle, or without proving the superiority of the enemy's forces. In upholding this principle, the idea of evacuating Orleans and of falling back upon Chartres or Toury, upon a point between these two places, or upon Orgeres, had necessarily to be given up. He at once decided to accept the challenge, and, as the initia tive was left to him, he had to decide where the battle was to commence. To remain in the town of Orleans would have been a strategical and tactical absurdity, and this course was not taken into con sideration. The Army was weak in infantry, but comparatively powerful in cavalry and artillery. Our aim was to utilise the superiority of these two arms, and to gain some advantage over the French infantry, which we knew beforehand to be numerically superior to our own. It was also desirable to take up a position at some point which could not be disregarded by the enemy, but . which must be attacked, if he wished to advance against Orleans from the west and take possession of the town. The position must be so chosen, that direct opposition"], [187, "Reconnaissance and Engagement of Chantome. 179 could be offered to the enemy's attack, which, according to pre vious reports, would most probably, be made via Ouzouer and Baccon, and must ensure the possibility of indirectly covering Orleans by an offensive movement of the Army (in the direction of Beaugency and Blois) against the left flank of the enemy, in case the latter made his chief attack by Cravant and along the Loire. In order to secure these two objects, which depended on the measures taken by the enemy, it was indispensable that the retreat of the Army towards the Paris road should be secured, and that it should not be forced back towards Orleans. The positions at St. Peravy-la-Colombe and at Coulmiers were the only two that would fulfil the above conditions, the first being on the road from Orleans to Chateaudun, the latter on the road which leads to Moree. From St. Peravy the Army would have had no difficulty in effecting a retreat to the Paris high road ; but, on the other hand, it was doubtful whether there would be a sufficient inducement for the enemy to attack that position, and whether he would not consider it more advisable to mask it with his cavalry and a portion of his infantry, and to enter Orleans without a blow by way of Ormes and La Chapelle. Such a movement, however, would have frustrated General v. d. Tann's fixed determination not to abandon Orleans without a struggle; and the accusation might have been justly made against him that, under pretence of proving the enemy's superiority, he had offered battle in such a position that it was open to the enemy not to accept it. The position of Coulmiers was the only alterna tive. Full use could there be made of our artillery, and the nature of the ground would partly compensate us for the numerical infe riority of our infantry, while our cavalry could not only be utilised against the French cavalry, but, in case of a successful issue, could also be used in pursuit of the enemy. In the position at Coulmiers the Army could offer direct opposition to the expected attack, and could force the enemy, in case he attempted to advance to the south against Orleans, to halt in his movement, to close with our forces, and thus to display his own strength. A successful issue of the contest would enable our right wing and our united cavalry to drive the enemy back towards Meung and Blois ; while, in case of an opposite result, our retreat by Gemigny N 2"], [188, "77/* Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 180 and Sougy upon Artenay and Toury would not have been easily endangered. Should we be unsuccessful, no effect would be produced on the battle-field by the expected attacks from the south and east, as the French Corps were too far off to be able to make their attacks on that day. As soon as General v. d. Tann had resolved to concentrate his forces at Coulmiers, he issued an order that the troops were to leave Orleans during the night, so as to be drawn up near Coul miers at daybreak. We may thank this resolution of General v. d. Tann, which was unshaken by a circumstance to be men tioned hereafter, that on November 9th the Army did not find itself in a situation which would have entailed far more serious consequences than the retreat which followed the engagement of Coulmiers. We have already had occasion, in speaking of the action at Orleans on October nth, to describe the zone of country which bounds Orleans on the north of the Loire, to a distance of from 9 to 12 English miles, and which renders an engagement extremely difficult, and in places almost forbids the use of cavalry and artil lery. The roads, which diverge in all directions from Orleans, assume in this zone the character of defiles, and it was along one of these defiles, on the east of Coulmiers, that the troops would have to march from Orleans to the extremity of the wood of Montpipeau, a distance of 12 English miles. The distance from Ouzouer-le-Marche, Prenouvellon, and Champdry, (points at which the enemy had been seen towards evening on November 8th,) to the exit from the defile, which we must gain, was not quite 9 English miles. It was even possible that the French might defeat the weak force (viz. one battalion which held Coulmiers,) and occupy the wood at Montpipeau ; while our columns, supposing them to have started on the morning of November 9th, would still be in the defile. It is unnecessary to mention all the combinations which might have arisen from such a situation, and we need only remark that the turning movement by St. Peravy in the direction of the Paris road, which was attempted by the enemy on November 9th, and frustrated during the engagement by our cavalry and artillery, would in that case have been successful. A report of the general situation and the intended concentration at Coulmiers was telegraphed to Lieut.-"], [189, "Reconnaissance and Engagement of Chantome. 181 General v. Wittich, who was requested to advance with all the forces at his disposal in the direction of Patay and St. Peravy; but as it was known that he was opposed by considerable forces at Illiers, Chateauneuf-en-Thymerais, &c, and as the distance from Chartres to Patay is 36 English miles, it was impossible to reckon upon more than the tardy support of his cavalry on the 9th of November. The orders for the march and the concentra tion at Coulmiers were issued at Orleans at 7 p.m. The 2nd Inf. Div. was ordered to be a c/ieval on the road to Ouzouer, between Montpipeau and Rosieres, at 6 A. M., and at the same hour the ist Inf. Div. was to be in its rear; while the Reserve Artillery was ordered to be at Les Barres, the 4th Cavalry Brigade to advance from the left bank of the Loire to St. Sigismond, and the 2nd Cav. Div. to continue its outpost duty. The telegraph detachment and the railway stock were to leave for Artenay at midnight. These orders had been issued to the troops, when a staff officer of the 2nd Cav. Div. arrived at Orleans, and announced that the enemy, after advancing at Charsonville, had apparently retired. This intelligence led us to imagine that the enemy had only been making an extended reconnaissance, in order to ascertain whether our situation had undergone any alteration since the engagement of Chantome. This suggestion, now made for the first time, together with the news received at the same moment, that Lieut-General v. Wittich was marching upon Orleans, induced General v. d. Tann to propose, that Orleans should not be com- pletely evacuated, but should be occupied by a detachment until the situation should be more clearly defined. The three Batns. Body Guards, two 4-pounder guns, and two squadrons of the 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt, were detailed for this duty. Should it be proved on the following day that an extended reconnaissance and not an attack had been intended by the French, the silent evacuation of Orleans during the night would be regarded by the inhabitants as an acknowledgment of our inferiority. If the enemy's intention was really to attack Orleans from all sides, it was probable that bodies of Franc-tireurs would enter the town from the south, as soon as we had abandoned the left bank of the Loire. With regard to the transfer of the railway stock to a place of safety, and to the position to be taken up by the Army, it would be very undesirable to allow the enemy to occupy Orleans so soon."], [190, "182 77/^ Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. The detachment left in Orleans was to perform the functions of a rear-guard and to cover the march from our present positions. General v. d. Tann left at 1 1 p.m., and aster remaining for a few hours in Ormes, proceeded to Coulmiers and joined the troops there before daybreak. This march brought another period of the active service of the I. Army Corps to a close. It is true that a month ago, when our victorious battalions passed through the dark streets of Orleans with bands playing and drums beating, the general feeling was a more cheerful one, than now when our troops left the town by night and in perfect quiet, merely to return a month later after fresh and severe engage ments. How many were destined never again to behold the brazen statue of the Maid of Orleans, which they had greeted with such joyful cheers ! The name of Orleans will ever recall the hardest-fought battles and . the heaviest losses, as well as the most glorious victories of the I. Army Corps.

The total strength of the enemy was at least 70,000 to 75,000 men,-f- and about 160 guns. On the morning of the 9th of November, we were aware that the enemy's forces were superior to our own, but no one suspected so vast a disparity. The troops had taken up their respective positions by 6. A.M. The ist Inf. Div. was at Descures, the 2nd Inf. Div. between Rosieres and Chateau-Montpipeau, both Divisions being a cheval on the high road. At the request of Lieut-General v. Stolberg, the latter Division had left the ist Batn.

Rifles had been quartered in Rosieres since the preceding evening. * The 3rd Inf. Div. had not yet joined the Army Corps. With regard to the strength of the brigades, a report of Oct. 18th gives a strength of 7,000 and 8,000 men to two brigades respectively of the 16th Corps (v. D'Aurelles, p. 19). It is probable that the troops had been reinforced between this date and the engagement of Coulmiers. f Freycinet says that 70,000 men advanced on the west of Orleans and 40,000 men from Gien. D'Aurelles, who usually seizes every opportunity of contradicting his former Minister of War, agrees with the above statement, and only regrets that the troops which came from Gien did not come into action at Coulmiers. X Because during the night the enemy had occupied in force the neighbouring villages of Le Bardon and Les Monts."], [195, "Action of Coulmiers. 187 The Cuirassier Brigade was concentrated at Peravy and watched the ground to its front, and the Reserve Artillery advanced to Les Barres. The 2nd Cav. Div. had taken up a position with the 3rd Cavalry Brigade and two Batteries of Horse Artillery (Colomb) on the west of La Riviere, and the 5th Cavalry Brigade (Baumbach) at Coulmiers. The 4th Cavalry Brigade (Barnekow) arrived early in the morning at St. Sigismond* The two Brigades first mentioned had sent out numerous patrols, which soon returned with the news of the enemy's advance. General v. d. Tann had joined Lieut-General v. Stolberg at Chateau Huisseau. By direction of the Chief of the Staff of the 2nd Inf. Div., Lieut.-Col. Muck, Coulmiers had been occupied by the 4th Brigade, before any definite arrangement had been made as to the disposition of the troops. The position between Rosieres and Montpipeau offered few advantages for defence, while it was ill adapted for an offensive movement, (which was contemplated by General v. d. Tann,) and it would tend to endanger the ulti mate line of retreat by Peravy towards Artenay. Major-General Schumacher, in command of the 2nd Inf. Div., who expected that an attack would shortly take place, had therefore ordered the occupation of Coulmiers and its immediate neighbourhood, and by so doing had effectually anticipated General v. d. Tann's wishes. Coulmiers, which lies on the road to Ouzouer-le-Marche, con sists, like all the villages of La Beauce, of stone houses, and has a massive castle with an extensive park. This park, which lies at the south-western extremity of the village and is surrounded by a thick quickset hedge and a ditch, was the key to the defence of Coulmiers, and its importance was enhanced by the fact that the main attacks of the enemy were made on that side of the village. From Coulmiers the ground falls gently for some distance towards the west, when it again rises, forming a valley, in which lies a group of houses, Carrieres-les-Crottes, close to the road. Both these slopes could be completely enfiladed from Coulmiers both by infantry and artillery fire, but unless we had occupied Car- * This brigade had broken up its camp on the south of Orleans at n p.m. on Nov. 8th, had rested for a short time in the town without unbridling, and marched by St. Peravy to St. Sigismond, which place it reached at 8 A.M. The men had therefore been nine hours in the saddle before the commencement of the engagement."], [196, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 188 rieres-les-Crottes we should have conceded a most advantageous point to the enemy. , , A large farm-house, Ormeteau, lay about as far to the north of Carrieres-les-Crottes as the latter place was to the west of Coul miers, namely, about 1,200 paces. sa .,pq , If the enemy obtained possession of Ormeteau, Carneres-ies- Crottes would have to be abandoned, and these two places once in his hands, he could attack Coulmiers on its northern and most unprotected side, and could seriously threaten the line of retreat of its garrison. Major-General Schumacher was, therefore, unable to confine himself to the occupation of Coulmiers, but was obliged to in clude in his plan of defence the triangle formed by Ormeteau, Carrieres-les-Crottes, and Coulmiers, which he occupied with the 4th Brigade (five battalions and the 4-pounder Brigade Battery), two 6-pounder Batteries, and two sqs. 4th Lt. Cav. Regt* The 4th Brigade, commanded by General Rudolph v. d. Tann, was drawn up at Coulmiers between 8 and 9 A.M. in the fol- lowing order : \u2014 The 2nd Batn. 13th Regt. (Maj. Schonhueb) occupied the whole south-west front of the park; the 3rd Batn. 13th Regt. (Capt. Haag) was also stationed in the park, but remained in rear as a reserve. The 6th company of the 2nd Batn. 13th Regt., which had been employed on outpost duty, occupied Carrieres-les-Crottes. The 7th Batn. Rifles (Capt. Hoderlein) was ordered to form the right wing, and with this object it took up a strong position among some small plantations and gravel-pits in the vicinity of Ormeteau. The 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. (Capt. Wetzger) was on the north of Coulmiers, and the 2nd Batn. ioth Regt. (Major Leythauser) was rather closer to the village, and posted on the road as a reserve. Three guns of Baumuller's 4-pounder Brigade Battery had taken up a position in the north-western corner of the park on the right of the 2nd Batn. 13th Regt, while the other three guns were drawn up close to, and north of, the road. Sewalder's 6-pounder Battery, which for the present was to be held in reserve, was ordered to a position on the north of the road ; the other 6-pounder Battery (Metz) and two squadrons remained further back and on the north of Coulmiers in reserve. * The four 6-pounder Batteries, which were with the Division, were equally divided between the two Brigades."], [197, "Action of Coulmiers. 189 Isolated rifle-shots were already audible in the direction of Baccon, while the above arrangements were in progress. The numerous small, but important, preparations, on which the possi bility of an obstinate resistance mainly depends, were not neglected by the garrison of the park ; distances were measured and marked out, gaps in the hedge were filled up, and each detachment had its special work assigned to it. These preparations, as well as the situation of the park, which was well adapted for defence, seemed to foretell that the enemy's task would be no easy one. In the meantime, General v. d. Tann, at Chateau Huisseau, had received the reports from the outposts, and had based his disposi tions upon them. All the reports received at 8 A.M. agreed in announcing, that strong columns of the enemy were advancing from the direction of Meung by Cravant and Baccon, but at that time no intelligence had been received from Charsonville of any advance of the French. It appeared as if the enemy's main attack would be directed against the line of the Mauve, or at any rate on La Renardiere and Rondonneau. If it was intended to adhere to the general plan of keeping the left wing on the defensive, while the right wing made an offensive movement towards the south-west, a change of position to the south would be necessitated. The enemy was to be held in check at the Mauve, while Coul miers, which would form the right of this fresh position, would be the point from which the offensive movement would be made. If, as appeared probable, the French really intended to force the line of the Mauve, the river must be occupied by sufficient forces. If the enemy had already crossed the Mauve between Huisseau and Presort, the left flank of the position at Coulmiers was turned, and such a movement could not be parried by a counter attack, until it was ascertained that we should not be threatened from the direction of Charsonville or Tournoisis. The loss of time, which thus unavoidably occurred, would have seriously compromised the position at Coulmiers, if the enemy had eventually advanced against it from Charsonville. The situation of the detachment, which had been left in Orleans, would be extremely critical, as soon as the enemy succeeded in crossing the Mauve and in sending a force against Orleans, which"], [198, "77/^ Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. 190 would make common cause with the excited population of the town. Time pressed ; reports of the enemy's advance followed fast upon each other, and skirmishing had commenced at the out posts. The following dispositions for the line of battle were made soon after 8 A.M. : \u2014 \" The 3rd Brigade will advance by Huisseau to Chateau Presort, will occupy the castle and its vicinity, and will meet any attack that may be made from the south-west or west, on the left bank of the Mauve, or on the road to Tours, by a direct or flank defence respectively.\" \"The ist Brigade will take up a position at Renardiere in readi ness for any eventuality.\" \" The 2nd Brigade will watch the road from Coulmiers, and will act as reserve in case of an attack from the direction of Mer.\" \" In case we attack, the general direction will be towards Mer ; our line of retreat will be towards Artenay.\" \" These movements are to be carried out at once.\" Colonel Tauffenbach's column in Orleans received an order to advance along the high road by La Chapelle, and to endeavour to establish communications with the 3rd Brigade at Chateau Presort, as soon as the sound of firing became audible on the west. The Reserve Artillery was ordered to march at once to Huisseau, and a staff officer was despatched to Peravy with the order to bring up the Cuirassier Brigade with its two batteries of Plorse Artillery and the 1st Batn. 13th Regt. from Peravy, and the 4th Cavalry Brigade from St. Sigismond to a position at Coulmiers. Under existing circumstances General v. d. Tann determined to adhere to his plan of assuming the offensive with his right wing at the right moment, and wished therefore to concentrate as strong a force of cavalry as possible at Coulmiers. These orders were received almost simultaneously (9 a.m.) by the various Infantry Brigades ; the 1st and 3rd Brigades at once commenced their march. The ist Brigade (Major-General Dietl) consisted of the 2nd Batn. Rifles (Major Wirthmann), ist Batn. (Captain Hoffman) and 2nd Batn. (Major Daffenreiter) ist Regt., Gruithuisen's 4-pounder"], [199, "Action of Coulmiers. 191 Brigade Battery, Hutten's 6-pounder Battery,* and one half-troop 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. By the time this Brigade had reached the wood of Montpipeau the engagement had commenced in the neighbourhood of Baccon, and the 1st Brigade, therefore, took up its position at once at Renardiere (10 A.M.). The 2nd Batn. Rifles prepared the castle and park of La Renardiere for defence, and occupied the adjacent village of the same name, in which iyi comps. ist Batn. Rifles were also posted.f The two batteries took up a position on the north of the park, while the ist and 2nd Batns. ist Regt. remained for the present in reserve somewhat in rear, but also on the north of the park. The first shot was fired shortly before 10 A.M. The two Batteries of Horse Artillery (Weltz, Ekensteen), attached to the 2nd Cav. Div., opened fire from their position abreast of Baccon upon the swarms of the enemy's skirmishers and the columns which followed them towards Baccon. It was the 3rd Division of the 15th French Corps which commenced the attack in that direction. For the sake of clearness, it may be as well to recapitulate the general position of General v. d. Tann's Army at 10 A.M. The Cuirassier Brigade was drawn up on the extreme right wing both south and north of St. Peravy, while the park, which lay at the western extremity of the village, was occupied by the ist Batn. 13th Regt. (Major Endres). The 4th Cavalry Brigade was rather more to the south at St. Sigismond. Outposts had been pushed forward towards Champs and along the high road towards Tour noisis, both by the Cuirassier and Maj. -General v. Barnekow's Brigades. Just as the staff officer arrived at St. Peravy (shortly before 10 A.M.), intelligence was brought in by the scouts of the presence of French infantry in Renneville, and of French cavalry a little more to the north, and of our patrols having been fired upon. It was possible that this was the head of a larger detachment, which * One of the 6-pounder Batteries of the Divisional Artillery was attached to each Brigade of the ist Inf. Div., while the two 6-pounder Batteries, detached from the Reserve Artillery, remained at the disposal of the Officer in Command of the Division. f The ist Batn. Rifles at the commencement of the engagement was under the command of Lieut.-Gen. v. Stolberg, and had one company in Baccon, one and half comps. in La Riviere and La Renardiere, one comp, on the east of La Renardifre in Grande Motte, and half a company on the west of Les Aunais."], [200, "The Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. 192 aimed at the capture of St. Peravy ; this was rendered all the more probable by the fact, that the squadron of Cuirassiers at Champs had intimated the advance of the enemy and had requested rein forcements. St. Peravy was in any case of great importance ; in the case of a retreat upon Artenay, it would form the pivot of the necessary wheel, and the possession of it would have great influence in securing an undisturbed and well-ordered retreat. Under these circumstances the officer in question considered himself justified in deviating from the order to bring up the Cuiras sier Brigade with its batteries and the ist Batn. 13th Regt. to Coulmiers, and in proposing to Maj. -General Tausch, who com manded the Brigade, to remain for the present at St. Peravy, and in case an advance should be made later, to leave the ist Batn. 13th Regt, one battery, and one squadron behind to defend this important point. The 4th Cavalry Brigade, on the contrary, obeyed General v. d. Tann's order, and marched from St. Sigismond to Coulmiers. At 10 A.M. the enemy had not as yet commenced operations at Coulmiers, but we received certain intelligence that strong French columns were advancing in that direction from Saintry.* Sewalder's 6-pounder Battery took up its intended position, the two battalions of the ioth Regt., which formed the reserve, were brought somewhat nearer, and the garrison at the edge of the park was strengthened by one company 3rd Batn. 13th Regt. The enemy meanwhile had opened fire upon the ist Brigade, which stood in La Renardiere, and had attacked the weak force (one company) occupying Baccon with overwhelming numbers. The 3rd Brigade was marching rapidly towards Chateau Presort. The 2nd Brigade, which formed the only reserve at General v. d. Tann's disposal (4 battalions), had advanced along the high road till it was abreast of Bonneville. The Reserve Artillery at Les Barres had received the order at 9 A.M. to move to Huisseau-sur-Mauve, and had advanced at a trot, but had been met half-way by an order only to march as far as Bonneville, and there to await further instructions. By degrees the enemy brought four batteries to bear upon Baccon from a position on the west at the farm of Selorges. * We have to thank the activity of the 5th Cavalry Brigade, under Major-General Baum bach, for the early intimation of the enemy's advance."], [201, "Action of Coulmiers. 193 Their fire was answered by the two Bavarian Batteries, as well as by the Batteries of the 2nd Cav. Div, which had taken up a position between Grand Lus and La Renardiere, escorted by the 3rd Cavalry Brigade. The enemy's infantry advanced in swarms, and kept up a brisk fire upon the riflemen in Baccon, where the ist comp, ist Batn. Rifles detained the enemy for more than an hour. It only evacu ated the place when ordered to withdraw into a position on the east of La Renardiere.* The French, having taken Baccon, proceeded to attack La Riviere with the assistance of four batteries, which were posted on both sides of Baccon. La Riviere was small, badly built, destitute of walled gardens, and ill adapted for defence. The position of a neighbouring farm, Le HeVon, was somewhat more favourable, and it was occupied by the ist comp. 2nd Batn. Rifles, while the remaining companies of that battalion, stationed at La Riviere, were partly engaged with the enemy and partly formed a reserve. In addition to the company ist Batn. Rifles, a company of the ist Regt. was posted in the park of La Renardiere. The enemy prepared the way for his infantry attack by a strong and well-directed fire of artillery, and a full hour aster the capture of Baccon, the French advanced on three sides against the burning village of La Riviere, with a strength of about eight battalions (3rd Division 15th Corps). The riflemen defended their position bravely, in the midst of smoke and flames, and in spite of the hail of shells and bullets. The enemy made but slow progress, and seemed disinclined to storm the place, until his opponents should be shelled out of their position. The numerical superiority of the enemy was, however, too great (8 Batns. to 1 Batn.) ; the French surrounded the advanced position of the 2nd Batn. Rifles, and its companies gradually withdrew upon the park of La Renardiere, supporting each other in succession. There they occupied the wall, which had already been prepared for defence. A few detachments had remained up to the last moment in La Riviere, and in order to enable them to retreat * Ekensteen's Prussian Battery of Horse Artillery materially assisted this company in effecting its retreat by its tire from a position near the western entrance of La Riviere. O"], [202, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 194 from the enemy, who was pressing in on three sides, the troops made a short sally from the park. The fire against the castle and park increased in violence, and considerable French detachments were seen advancing on the east, with the evident intention of turning the left flank of the position at La Renardiere. Major-General Dietl, who was in command, did not wish to engage the whole of his weak brigade in the defence of one point, viz. Chateau Renardiere, being obliged to take measures to frus trate the enemy's turning movement. The ist Batn. ist Regt., of which the 4th comp., under Capt. Tauffkirchen, was engaged in the park, was ordered to take up a position on the south of La Renardiere, in order to secure the left flank ; while the two batteries on the north of the park, as well as those which were with the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, having taken up a position further to the rear, kept up a vigorous fire against the French artillery at Baccon. It was now a little past noon. In the time between 10 A.M. and noon the engagement had been rapidly developed at other points of the battle-field. At 10.30 A.M. strong lines of French infantry, which advanced towards the park but afterwards halted in their movement, were visible from Coulmiers on the opposite slope, south of Saintry. The fire of the batteries between Grand Lus and La Renardiere had brought the advancing columns (2nd Div. 15th Corps) to a standstill, and forced them to wait until the engagement was more developed, and until the 15th Corps made its attack upon Baccon. Meanwhile the left wing of the 15 th Corps continued its advance against Coulmiers, and its troops, consisting both of infantry and artillery, were seen marching from Epieds by Villevoindreux towards Cheminiers. This turning movement, together with the increasing intensity of the firing at Baccon, and the fact that the French columns at Saintry remained stationary, seemed to indicate that the enemy intended to turn our position on both flanks. The 4th Brigade at Coulmiers was immediately threatened by these tactics ; if success fully carried out, this Brigade could be attacked from the north and its retreat endangered. . In the face of the strong French columns, which could be clearly seen approaching our right wing, and taking into consider ation the very weak forces that remained at our disposal, the"], [203, "Action of Coulmiers. 195 position of the 4th Brigade was certainly most critical. Any further delay would have been unwise, for with every quarter of an hour the enemy's turning movements were nearer completion, and the reserve (the 2nd Brigade) was still far in rear at Bonne ville. The Officer Commanding the 2nd Inf. Div., who was at Coul miers, at once made the necessary dispositions to delay the enemy, until reinforcements could come up. Sewalder's 6-pounder Battery, and the three guns of Baumuller's Battery which were drawn up by the road, had opened fire upon the advancing column as soon as it became visible, with such good effect that the enemy halted and replied with two batteries from a height near Villevoindreux. Lieut.-Col. Muck, Chief of the Staff of the 2nd Inf. Div., had meanwhile directed the execution of the orders with praiseworthy celerity. Ormeteau was the point most immediately in danger, and the 7th Batn. Rifles, which had been stationed in a small wood near the farm buildings, now advanced hastily to the farm, which it reached just in time, the enemy being within 400 yards of it. The riflemen prepared Ormeteau for defence, and occupied an avenue on the south. The enemy was soon repulsed. Metz' 6-pounder Battery, which had hitherto been held in reserve, now advanced to the road which leads from Ormeteau to Car rieres-les-Crottes, took up a position on the south of the former place, and there opened fire. The 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. took up a position en potcnce on the extreme right flank, with its right wing fronting towards Vauri chard. The 2nd Batn. ioth Regt. remained on the north of Coulmiers as the only reserve. The enemy continually brought fresh batteries to bear upon Coulmiers, and surprised us, not only by his numbers but also by the precision of his fire, and gradually convinced us of the fallacy of the hope that we had entertained, that our artillery, at any rate, would prove superior to that of the French. The 4th Brigade had to cover a front of more than 2,500 paces, with a force of only five battalions.* The enemy apparently suspected the presence of strong reserves between Ormeteau and Coulmiers, for he poured a continuous hail of shells upon that space. Unfortunately, this * The ist Batn. 13th Regt., was in St. Peravy. O 2"], [204, "The Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. 196 supposition was unfounded; our last reserve was just being brought into action. The 2nd Brigade (Maj.-Gen. Orff) was constituted as follows :\u2014 4th Batn. Rifles (Capt. Wohr). 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt. (Major Coulon). 2nd Batn. nth Regt. (Major Bohe). 9th Batn. Rifles (Lieut.-Col. Massenbach). Grundherr's 4-pounder Brigade Battery. It may be interesting to add, with regard to the achievements of this Brigade during the next few hours, that its total strength did not exceed 3,145 men. At 1 1 A.M., when Maj.-General Orff received the intelligence that the enemy was about to turn our right flank, he decided, with the sanction of General v. d. Tann, who had just arrived from La Renardiere, to advance in the direction from which we were threatened, and to delay the enemy's attack by an offensive stroke. Lieut. -General v. Stephan, who commanded the Division, and whose two Brigades were fighting on the outer flanks, remained with the 2nd Brigade, which was advancing in the direction likely to lead to the most decisive result. Schleich's 6-pounder Battery of the Divisional Artillery, Gramich's Division (Soldner's and Prince Leopold's 6-pounder Batteries), and the only squadron of the 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. present on the battle-field, were attached to the 2nd Brigade. The 4th Cav. Brigade, which stood near Bonneville, advanced with the 2nd Brigade. From Tournoisis, at 1 1 A.M., nothing could be seen of the enemy along the road, and Maj.-General Tausch advanced towards the south-west, leaving one squadron with the ist Batn. 13th Re\u00b0-t. and Hellingrath's Battery of Horse Artillery at Peravy. The Brigade, consisting of seven squadrons Cuirassiers, one squadron Hussars from Barnekow's Brigade, and Lepel's Battery of Horse Artillery, had advanced for a short distance, when a force of French cavalry showed itself and unmasked a strong line of artillery, consisting of about three batteries. Lepel's Battery of Horse Artillery at once came into action ; the Brigade formed up on the right rear of the Battery in line of contiguous quarter-distance columns, and an artillery engagement commenced, in which Hellingrath's Battery of Horse Artillery, which had been fetched from St. Peravy, soon joined."], [205, "Action of Coulmiers. 197 The 3rd Brigade had reached Chateau Presort at 10.30 A.M., after a rapid march of two hours. The Brigade was constituted as follows :* \u2014 (\u25a0 ist Batn. (Major Kohlermann). 3rd Regt. j 2nd \u201e (Capt. Parseval). 1 3rd \u201e (Major Veith). (ist Batn. (Capt.

Stadelmann's 4-pounder Brigade Battery, Daffner's Division of Reserve Artillery (Mehn's and Neu's 6-pounder Batteries), and the 2nd squadron, 4th Lt. Cav. Regt, were attached to the Brigade. The vicinity of Chateau Presort was occupied as follows : \u2014 The ist. Batn. 3rd Regt. had already made preparations for defending the castle, the 3rd Batn. 3rd Regt. advanced to La Challerie, the 3rd Batn. 1 2th Regt. to Preau, and the remaining three battalions took up a position on the east of Chateau Presort. A 6-pounder battery was drawn up near the castle somewhat later. At noon a picket of the Rifles at Les Aunais reported that a French brigade was advancing to the north, and another against Presort. The troops at that time were distributed as follows : \u2014 On the right wing, between St. Sigismond and St. Peravy, the Cuirassier Brigade was engaged against artillery and cavalry. In the centre, the 4th Brigade extended from Vaurichard by Ormeteau to Coulmiers, and its three batteries and two 6-pounder batteries f (Andrian and Reder) of the Reserve Artillery were engaged in a contest with the enemy's artillery. In La Renardiere, the ist Brigade with two batteries, supported by the 3rd Cavalry Brigade with two batteries, still maintained its position, in spite of the superior forces of the French. On the extreme left wing, at Chateau Presort, the 3rd Brigade was in observation. The 2nd Brigade was on the march from Bonneville in the direction of Champs, and Thurheim's Mitrailleuse Battery at Bonneville formed the only remaining reserve. * The ist Batn. Rifles belonging to this Brigade was fighting at La Renardiere. t These Batteries had been ordered to advance by General v. d. Tann. Andrian's Battery had taken up a position on the right of Metz' Batteiy, while Reder's Battery was on the south east of Coulmiers."], [206, "198 The Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. The situation could not be described as brilliant, but was not such as to make us abandon all hope. Everything depended on our being able to reinforce the ist Brigade at La Renardiere by bringing up the 3rd Brigade in time to hinder the enemy's advance in that direction. We had every reason to hope that the 2nd Brigade with its two batteries would be able to detain the enemy on the front and right flank, between Champs and Coulmiers, or even to repulse him by a vigorous attack. The reasons for sending the 3rd Brigade to Chateau Presort have been described above, and we must repeat that the employ ment of this Brigade, and indeed the whole formation of the line of battle, at 8 A.M., resulted from the reports received at Chateau Huisseau ; the orders, which were issued at that hour, cannot be judged by the state of the engagement at noon. It would be un just to find fault with the original destination of the 3rd Brigade, merely on account of the enemy's forces, which were visible be tween 11 A.M. and noon between Baccon and Champs. At 11 A.M. no one would have thought for a moment of detaching a single man from the declared line of battle. At Coulmiers we had an instance of the great disadvantage of every defensive attitude, namely, a complete uncertainty as to the enemy's line of attack, the initiative of course being taken by the side that is acting on the offensive. This uncertainty and the ensuing loss of time is still more prejudicial when, as in this case, the forces acting on the offensive are four times as numerous as those acting on the defensive. Between 1 1 a.m. and noon the enemy's plan became sufficiently obvious, and after the reserve, consisting of the 2nd Brigade, had moved to our right wing, which was threatened, and two 6-pounder batteries of the three batteries of the Reserve Artillery were brought into action to strengthen the front of the position at Coulmiers, the 3rd Brigade received an order to march as quickly as possible by Huisseau to the left flank of the ist Brigade. The distance from Coulmiers, where General v. d. Tann hap pened to be, to Chateau Presort is about 6 English miles as the crow flies, and about 7^ miles by road. At least an hour elapsed after orders were issued, before the 3rd Brigade could be collected from the different places round Chateau Presort, and could commence its march ; and it was more than two hours before it could be made any use of, either at La Renardiere"], [207, "Action of Coulmiers. 199 or at Coulmiers. These hours from noon to 3 p.m. included the crisis of the engagement. The 1st Brigade, as above mentioned, had been driven back soon after noon, with the 2nd Batn. Rifles and the 4th comp, ist Regt., into the park and castle of La Renardiere, where it offered the most obstinate resistance. The 1st Batn. Rifles occupied a position on the lest (south-east) of the place, and at 1 p.m., after holding the farm of La Grande Motte for some time, commenced to retreat slowly from the left. The ist Brigade, from its isolated position and the total absence of any support, was in danger of being surrounded by the enemy, even if it held the castle and park. The 2nd Batn. Rifles, the gallant behaviour of which was even recorded in the despatches of the French Commander-in-Chief, was therefore ordered by Maj.-General v. Dietl to evacuate the park. The enemy poured in as soon as the riflemen retired, but did not pursue them beyond La Renardiere. The riflemen were collected on a small height near the farm of Clos ; Hutten's 6-pounder Battery took up a position on the south, and Gruithuisen's 4-pounder Battery on the north of the small road leading to Montpipeau ; the ist Batn. ist Regt. was on the right rear of the 4-pounder Battery, the 2nd Batn. ist Regt. on the left wing, next to the 6-pounder Battery. The 3rd Cavalry Brigade, with the two Batteries of Horse Artillery, had taken up a position in the neighbourhood of La Motte aux Taurins.* The engagement at Coulmiers did not progress, and at this time, between 2 and 3 P.M., the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, which was on the right of the ist Brigade, marched back to Bonneville. The ist Brigade continued to retreat slowly and unmolested towards the wood of Montpipeau, but it had hardly reached the southern edge of the wood when intelligence was received (at 3 p.m.) of the advance of a strong French column, which had turned La Renardiere on the east. The 2nd Batn. ist Regt. was detached from the 1st Brigade to occupy the south-western extremity of the wood, while both the Batteries, as well as the ist Batn. 1st Regt., took up a position on the right. The 3rd Cavalry Brigade, with the two Batteries of Horse Artillery that had already reached the high road, at once advanced at a * This Cavalry Brigade, with both Batteries of Horse Artillery, was sent back to Bonneville by General v. d.

The former had started at 1 p.m., and had received an order on the way to send forward the two 6-pounder Batteries of Daffner's Division at a trot to Coulmiers ; and when the high road was reached at 3 p.m. the 3rd Batn. 12th Regt., which was marching in advance, was despatched by Lieut.-Col. Heinleth, Chief of the Staff, to reinforce the detachments engaged in the park of Coulmiers. The remaining battalions, which were joined by the ist Batn. Rifles, took up a position at the north-western corner of the wood of Montpipeau. On receipt of the intelligence of the enemy's advance, the three Batns. 3rd Regt. were sent from the above-mentioned position to join the ist Brigade on the southern edge of the wood of Mont pipeau, and Stadelmann's 4-pounder Battery joined the two Batteries that were already in position. The numerical superiority of the French was severely felt at all points. The 3rd Brigade, which was exhausted by the night march and the hurried marches to and from Chateau Presort, only pos sessed two intact battalions.f Between 1 and 2 p.m. the pressure of the enemy at Coulmiers became more and more serious. The French troops (2nd Div. 16th Corps), hitherto delayed by the undecided engagement at La Renardiere, endeavoured to make up for lost time by a more decided advance. Swarms of skirmishers, followed by detach ments in close order, made a determined advance upon the park, Carrieres-les-Crottes, and Ormeteau. The garrison of the park was too weak to oppose the superior numbers of the French ; the 2nd Batn. ioth Regt., which formed * Weltz and Ekensteen's Batteries of Horse Artillery once more took up a position abreast of La Motte aux Taurins, and thus covered the left flank of the troops which were fighting in Coulmiers, and prevented the enemy from taking any advantage of the dangerous gap between them and the ist Brigade. f These were the ist and 2nd Batns. 12th Regt. The ist Batn. Rifles had been under fire at Baccon, La Riviere, and La Renardiere. We learn from French sources, that the position of the 3rd Brigade at Presort prevented the advance of French detachments by Huisseau against Ormes."], [209, "Action of Coulmiers. 201 the last reserve, was brought up, and was divided as follows : \u2014 the 5 th comp, in the southern houses of Coulmiers, the 7th comp, on the right flank of the 2nd Batn. 13th Regt., the 6th comp, to strengthen the line of fire of the latter Batn., the 8th and last to from a reserve in the park. The last Infantry detachment of the 4th Brigade was thus dis posed of. It was now necessary to abandon Carrieres-les-Crottes, for the enemy had turned the left flank of the Brigade, and threatened to cut off the retreat of the 6th comp. 13th Regt., which occupied the hamlet. We may thank the devoted exertions of the five Batteries (Andrian, Metz, Sewalder, Baumuller, Reder), which were drawn up between Ormeteau and Coulmiers, for the fact that the enemy's forces laboured in vain during four hours to break down the gallant resistance made by our infantry. The 7th Batn. Rifles maintained its position in the farm of Ormeteau and repulsed several attacks ; the 3rd Batn. 10th Regt. was equally successful between Vaurichard and Ormeteau. While the enemy's skirmishers drew nearer and nearer to the park, and kept up an incessant hail of bullets, his artillery shelled the park, Coulmiers, and the ground between the latter and Ormeteau, almost incessantly. Some of the shells went as far as Bonneville, and, falling on the high road, created great confusion among the camp followers and baggage-train. Up to that time the 4th Brigade had not relaxed its hold upon a single foot of ground, with the exception of Carrieres-les-Crottes ; on the contrary, Andrian's and Metz' Batteries had been joined by two guns of Sewalder's Battery, and had advanced several hundred paces in order to fire more effectively upon the enemy's artillery. Baumiiller's Battery, on the right flank of the garrison of the park, was actually in the line of skirmishers, and maintained this very unusual position for artillery during the whole engage ment, in spite of heavy losses. On the south-east of Coulmiers, Reder's 6-pounder Battery of the Reserve Artillery was equally effective. With the assistance of the artillery, the troops in the park offered a most stubborn resistance, and completely repulsed two successive attacks. The courage displayed both by infantry and artillery deserved to be rewarded by a brilliant success, but our hopes of such a result became more and more faint."], [210, "202 The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. The 3rd Brigade had not yet arrived ; intelligence was received from La Renardiere, that the ist Brigade had been forced to retire before superior forces. The Brigades of the 2nd Cav. Div. were useless against the well-posted French infantry and the bat teries which they covered. General v. d. Tann had not a single man in reserve on the whole battle-field. The enemy's artillery and infantry fire increased every moment in intensity, and his troops were turning our left flank more and more, and pressing forward against the park from the south. About 3 p.m. two French 8-pounder Batteries were brought up to Grand Lus, and, with the Batteries at Saintry, Epieds, and Villevoindreux, opened a cross fire upon our position at Coulmiers, which far surpassed in violence all that had gone before, and showed that the enemy wished to strike a final and decisive blow, and that he was bringing up considerable forces from La Renardiere. General v. d. Tann had shortly before despatched an order to the two 6-pounder Batteries of the 3rd Brigade to advance without delay, and as soon as the attack from the direction of Grand Lus commenced, the last remaining battery, Thiirheim's Mitrail leuse Battery, was directed to move towards Coulmiers. The 3rd Batn. 12th Regt., which headed the 3rd Brigade, also advanced in support. Before endeavouring to describe the approaching termination of the engagement at Coulmiers, we must give an account of the part taken by the Cuirassier Brigade and the 2nd Brigade in the battle, between noon and 3 p.m. The latter Brigade had arrived abreast of Cheminiers about 12.30 p.m., whence it could observe the enemy's position between that place and Champs. Major-General Orff ordered the Brigade to deploy, a movement which was executed under a vigorous and well-directed fire from the enemy's guns.* The four batteries which formed Gramich's Division (Soldner's and Prince Leopold's 6-pounder Batteries, Grundherr's 4-pounder Brigade Battery, and Schleich's 6-pounder Battery), took up positions on the left of the Brigade and made a vigorous reply to the enemy's fire. * Major Mehn, one of the most gallant officers of the 2nd Regt., was mortally wounded by a shell."], [211, "Action of Coulmiers. 203 The 9th Batn. Rifles and 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt. formed the first line, and the 4th Batn. Rifles and 2nd Batn. nth Regt. formed the second line. The 4th Cavalry Brigade was posted on the right rear of the 2nd Brigade. Our guns opened fire at 1 p.m., and the infantry found some scanty cover in a slight depression of the ground. About 2 p.m., the enemy's batteries were either silenced or forced to take up positions more to the rear. A strong column of cavalry was now observed marching from Champs in the direction of Cheminiers. The formation of the column, preceded by scouts, raised doubts whether it was French or German. An officer of Hussars* galloped boldly forward, and soon ascertained that the former was the case, and the artillery opened a very effective fire on the cavalry, which had wheeled into line. A few well-directed shells forced the enemy to retire towards the wests The 4th Cavalry Brigade had endeavoured by a short advance to provoke the numerically superior cavalry of the French to an attack, but the enemy did not consider it advisable to accept the challenge. At 2 p.m., just at the moment when the engagement at Coul miers had reached its climax, Major-General Orff with his mere handful of troops assumed the offensive, with the intention of taking Cheminiers and the gently rising heights upon which it lies. The 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt., with the 4th Batn. Rifles and the 9th Batn. Rifles on either side, advanced in first line, and the 2nd Batn. nth Regt. followed in reserve. The infantry and artillery advanced simultaneously, and took up a position on the bridle-road leading from Champs to Bonneville. As the brigade approached Cheminiers, which was believed to be only slightly occupied, the enemy's line was continually reinforced, and his fire increased in violence. The whole ground from Champs to a point opposite Ormeteau was covered by a swarm of skirmishers, behind which appeared troops in close order, which were evidently far superior in numbers to the 2nd Brigade (ist Div. 1 6th Corps). The enemy's strength might be reckoned * 2nd Lieutenant v. Endell. f It was Reyau's Cav. Div., which after severe losses was forced to retire by the appearance of our Cuir.

Bavarian Army Corps. 204 at eight battalions,* without taking into consideration the pos- sibility of reserves further to the rear, where the formation of the ground would prevent our knowing of their existence. The ground was as unfavourable as possible ; it rose gently towards Cheminiers, which, as we now know, was strongly garrisoned, and it afforded neither cover nor points d'appui. The enemy's skir- mishers and serried battalions were partly on the west of these gently-sloping heights in and around Cheminiers, and partly under cover further to the rear, and were able to sweep the ground which the 2nd Brigade must traverse in its advance, while they themselves were almost completely sheltered from the infantry fire. As soon as intelligence was received, at 3 P.M., that the battle at Coulmiers was progressing unfavourably, Maj.-General Orff resolved to abandon the attack, but at all risks to hold his position, in spite of its disadvantages, and in spite of the superiority of the enemy, who must by this time have been well aware of the small numbers of our troops, and by so doing, to secure the retreat to St. Sigismond of the troops engaged at Coulmiers. The last reserve, consisting of the 2nd Batn. nth Regt., was sent forward into the first line, to relieve the 9th Batn. Rifles, which had exhausted its ammunition. An attack seemed imminent ; for the enemy was emboldened by his superiority, and by the favourable turn taken by the engagement at Coulmiers. Maj.-General Orff was resolved to meet any attack by a counter attack, but the well-directed fire of our four batteries prevented matters coming to such a pass. We have already mentioned, that the artillery belonging to the Cuirassier Brigade, on the extreme right wing of the whole position, had been engaged since 11.30 A.M. with the batteries attached to a column of French cavalry, which had advanced upon St. Peravy. After an artillery engagement of almost two hours' duration, in which the enemy, according to his own account, suffered heavy losses, the cavalry column withdrew in the direction of Champs (2.30 p.m.), and was observed soon afterwards in its retreat by the 2nd Brigade, the guns of which opened a successful fire upon it. * This supposition was afterwards corroborated by General Chanzy's report. Four Batns. of our 2nd Brigade were opposed by about fourteen Batns. , in addition to the Franc-tireurs, at Champs."], [213, "Action of Coulmiers. 205 Maj.-General Tausch was about to follow the retreating cavalry with his Cuirassiers, when information was received that the village of St. Sigismond, on the left flank of the Cuirassier Brigade, was occupied by the enemy. A detachment of Chasseurs a Cheval* had succeeded in reaching that place during the artillery engage ment, and had betrayed their existence by the fire of their carbines. These daring horsemen, together with their supports on the west of St. Sigismond, were quickly driven back by the squadron of Hussars and half a troop of Cuirassiers ; \\ and the Cuirassier Brigade began its march to Champs, which was occupied by the enemy's infantry. Lepel's and Hellingrath's Batteries of Horse Artillery opened fire upon the village and set it on fire. It was about 3 P.M., when the enemy made a disorderly retreat from Champs, but the Batteries of Horse Artillery, which had nearly expended their ammunition, were now fired upon and forced to retire by some artillery j of very superior range and calibre, which had taken up a position between Champs and Cheminiers. While the Horse Artillery Batteries retired to St. Sigismond for purposes of reorganization, the Cavalry Brigade received intel ligence of the renewed advance of the enemy's cavalry from the direction of Cerqueu, and moved northwards towards La Vallee to meet a turning movement, which might be intended. At 3 p.m. the general situation was as follows : \u2014 The right wing, consisting of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade and the Cuirassier Brigade, held in check the French forces on the west of the line Champs \u2014 Cheminiers, and the enemy's cavalry was already in retreat. \u00a7 In the centre, between Ormeteau and Coulmiers, the battle had reached its climax ; the defenders had almost exhausted both their ammunition and their strength.

Tann had only two battalions at his disposal that had not yet been into action, viz. those of the 1 2th Regt., which, after the exhausting march, were anything but fresh. All the artillery was engaged, and the cavalry was unable, under the existing circumstances, to turn the scale in our savour. An attack would probably have been followed by heavy losses ; and even if we were fortunate enough to obtain a momentary success, we should have been unable to profit by it, owing partly to our having no infantry in reserve, and partly to the enemy's numerical superiority.

Tann became convinced of the necessity of adopting one of two alternatives, either to hold his position till nightfall, even if it cost him his last man and his last cartridge, or to retire while the favourable position of the right wing, and the intact condition of the 3rd Brigade, would permit of a well-ordered retreat. The first course would in any case have entailed immense losses, and would of necessity have brought all the troops into action. If we were ultimately forced to retreat, while the enemy, as was to be expected, had further troops in reserve, all tactical cohesion would be lost, and the retreat would degenerate into a defeat. General v. d. Tann could only have ventured on such a course if he had known that there were sufficiently strong supports at hand to recommence the battle on the following day. The 22nd Inf. Div., which was the nearest support, was, however, at Voves,* more than 30 English miles from the field of battle. It must be borne in mind, that the French troops, which were advancing from east and south, might be expected to take part in an action on the ioth of November. General v. d.

Meanwhile (4 p.m.) the moment had arrived that decided the fate of Coulmiers. Reder's 6-pounder' Battery, escorted by a squadron of Hussars, had been ordered to advance with Andrian's 6-pounder Battery, and had taken up a position on the south-east of Coulmiers, to secure the left flank of the 4th Brigade. It was now forced to retire to the high road by the approach of the enemy's skir mishers,* and by the fire of his batteries at Grand Lus. It was joined in its retreat by the two Prussian Batteries of Horse Artil lery, which had been posted at La Motte aux Taurins. The troops which defended the park had almost exhausted their ammunition, and at some points were unable to hold the boundary wall ; Baumiiller's 4-pounder Battery was forced to retire to avoid being captured, a movement which, owing to the disadvantages of the ground and the reduced number of horses, was only effected with fresh loss. The 3rd Batn. 12th Regt., which had been brought up in support, arrived with a squadron of the 4th Lt. Cav. Regt. and the Mitrailleuse Battery, just as some of the detachments, which had no ammunition left, were about to retire. The Battalion advanced into the park, drove back the enemy's skirmishers with loud cheers, and reoccupied the boundary wall. The Mitrailleuse Battery took up a position on the south-east, outside the park, and opened fire.t In spite of these reinforcements, it was impossible to hold the park and castle for any length of time, and an order was received from General v. d. Tann to retire slowly. Colonel Ysenburg.j who directed the troops in the park, now organized the retreat, which was effected without undue haste, the companies of the 13th Regt. supporting each other, and some * On this occasion the Officer Commanding the Battery formed a few of the escort and some of the gunners, armed with Chassepots, into a line of skirmishers, to cover the front of the Battery against the French riflemen. f The Mitrailleuse Battery was not of much service in spite of the activity of its officers ; the crisis had arrived, and there was neither time nor opportunity to seek for positions from which the mitrailleuses could be used with full effect.

A subdivision of the Mitrailleuse Battery, and some detachments of the ioth Regt. under Captain Kraft, were the last to leave the village, into which the enemy was pouring from all sides. At Ormeteau, the 7th Batn. Rifles, with the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt., had also been obliged to retire. Andrian's and Metz' Batteries, which, in spite of the constant fire of shells, had been supported for some time by the 5th Cavalry Brigade (Baumbach), retired in e'chelon until in alignment with Neu's and Mehn's Bat teries (Daffner's Division),* which were drawn up about 500 paces north of Coulmiers. This artillery prevented the enemy from penetrating between Ormeteau and Coulmiers, beyond the latter of which the French never even attempted a pursuit. All the men, irrespective of their regiments, who had any ammunition left, were now formed by Colonel Ysenburg into a line of skirmishers, under cover of which the 4th Brigade withdrew. As soon as Coulmiers was evacuated, the ist Brigade was ordered to retire by Coinces and Sougy towards Artenay, similar orders being sent to the 4th Cavalry Brigade and the 2nd Brigade ; the retreat was carried out in the exemplary order that had been maintained throughout. The enemy made no sign of pursuing our battalions, as they retired in eclielon, but merely continued to fire upon them, until prevented by the increasing distance and darkness. The Cuirassier Brigade, which had been joined at nightfall by the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, was on the west of St. Sigismond and flanked our line of retreat. The 3rd Brigade had been ordered to take up a position be tween St. Sigismond and Gemigny, from which to cover the retreat of the other Brigades. The 5 th Cavalry Brigade (Baumbach) remained as rear-guard in the neighbourhood of Vaurichard.f until complete darkness had set in.

Of the remaining troops, the ist and 2nd Brigades and the 4th Cavalry Brigade reached Artenay at midnight, after a fatiguing march along wretched roads, which had been rendered almost impassable by the snow and rain that had fallen since evening. The 4th Brigade bivouacked at St. Peravy with the Cuirassier Brigade, which had its outposts in the direction of Tournoisis. The Reserve Artillery and Gramich's Artillery Division, escorted by the 2nd Batn. Rifles, occupied bivouacks and confined canton ments at Lignerolles. General v. d. Tann took up his quarters in the Castle of St. Peravy, where the supports of the outposts were stationed. Although the general feeling was not cheerful, it could not be described as desponding. The consciousness of having done their duty to the fullest extent, and the conviction, which was forced upon officers and soldiers alike, that they had only given way before overwhelming numbers of the enemy, prevented our troops from suffering from the moral effects of a defeat. On the other hand, their state of bodily exhaustion was such as to render it doubtful whether they could resume the fight on the following day. Many detachments had been 36 hours on the march or actually fighting, without having had time to cook any food, and all the troops had executed two night marches under the most unfavour able circumstances. \u00bb \" on pouvait penser que si l'ennemi avait du. abandonner ses positions il allait profiter de la nuit pour se preparer k les reprendre le lendemain ; \" and further on: \" Les villages d'Epieds, Champs, Ormeteau et Coulmiers furent mis en etat de defense dans la soiree mOme.\" The Germans were certainly not so prudent after their victories. \u25a0f- The 4th Regt. of Hussars was detached from this Brigade to Artenay, in order to escort the train thence to Toury.

J The following may be taken as a proof that the general feeling was not that of defeat. The Reserve Ammunition-train, one Hospital, and the three Detachments of the Commissariat-train belonging to the Corps, were in Artenay, and the Baggage-train was in La Croix Briquet. The latter marched at noon on Nov. 9th through Artenay, but the other detachments remained stationary, and prepared to defend their position, as they had received no orders to march. Every cannon-shot could be distinctly heard, and the report, re ceived at nightfall, that our right wing was advancing, was gladly believed, and nothing occurred of a disquieting nature, until they were taken by surprise by an order to march that night to Toury. The laden wagons at once drove off in good order, the empty ones were filled from the magazines, which had been established, and * The losses of the 2nd Cav.

Before we conclude our description of the memorable day of Coulmiers, we must mention the march of Colonel Tauffenbach's detachment after leaving Orleans. As already mentioned, Colonel Tauffenbach had been ordered to advance along the high road by La Chapelle to the Mauve, and to open communications with the 3rd Brigade at Chateau Presort, as soon as firing should be heard on the west. At noon the detachment marched from Orleans along the Loire.* The attitude of the population was excited and threaten ing, but no open hostilities were offered.-f- In the meantime, circumstances had assumed an aspect very different to our anticipations at Huisseau that morning. At 2.30 P.M., when the head of Colonel Tauffenbach's column had pushed forward as far as St. Ay, nothing could be seen of the 3rd Brigade, but heavy firing was heard on the north. An officer's patrol]: of the 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt, which had been sent forward to reconnoitre, when about three miles to the north of Huisseau, found itself in rear of a French detach ment fronting towards the north, much to the surprise of both parties, and thus ascertained that the enemy was between the main body and the column. The uncertainty of the situation and the great distance from the main body of the Army Corps, made an attempt to open communications with the Corps by Ormes the only course that was open to Colonel Tauffenbach. He arrived at Ormes at night fall, and learnt that General v. d. Tann had ordered a retreat upon Artenay. The troops, which were already very tired, con tinued their march, and arrived at Cercottes at 1 A.M. in a state of complete exhaustion. Many (74) fell out on the road, and were unable to proceed from fatigue, and, being easily taken prisoners * At 1 p.m. an order had been sent from Coulmiers to Tauffenbach's column to march as quickly as possible to Peravy by Ormes, but the order was only received at 4 p M. at St. Ay. + An officer of the 3rd Lt.

A retreat after a battle is the severest test to which troops can be subjected, and, however well executed, must always be a painful experience. The I. Corps had fought six battles and engagements, without having once been compelled to retire ; we were spoilt by this good fortune, and were more surprised than annoyed at not gaining a seventh victory. Although we constantly bore in mind the enemy's vast supe riority in numbers, it was impossible to disguise the fact that we were retreating in silence and by night through the snow and rain ; and the consciousness that it was the Bavarian troops that were retreating, did not tend to diminish the disagreeable impres sion. The troops, which had bivouacked in the wet fields round St. Peravy, marched at midnight. General v. d. Tann rode immediately in front of the rear-guard, which had left its position between Gemigny and St. Sigismond at i A. M. (November ioth), under the command of General Baumbach. The march was carried out in excellent order, without any difficulties deserving of mention ; some artillery, which had been of great service in the engagement of the previous day, and which had not received the order to continue the retreat in time, was found in Lignerolles, and was now ordered to retreat. General v. d. Tann had ordered the 3rd Cavalry Brigade of the 2nd Cav. Div. to cover the two flanks of the column. The 2nd Regt. of Lancers and one battery accordingly marched by Coinces, Creuzy, and Ruan, and the ist Regt. of Cuirassiers with one battery, by Patay, Terminiers, Lumeau, Santilly, and Janville, to Toury. The ist Inf. Div. was ordered to remain in Artenay, and to cover that place on the south with one brigade and two 6-pounder batteries, until the remaining troops got well beyond Artenay, when it was to retreat to Toury. The fate of Colonel Tauffenbach's troops, which had been left behind in Orleans, and of which no intelligence had been received, was General v. d. Tann's most pressing anxiety during the night march. The glad news was received at Artenay, that the Body Guards, with the cavalry and artillery, were in Cercottes."], [221, "Action of Coulmiers. 213 The detachment was followed by French troops from the direction of Orleans, and was now ordered to advance to Artenay and to form the rearguard. At that place the 2nd Brigade had meanwhile taken up a posi tion as rear-guard. Two companies of the 4th Batn. Rifles were posted on the road which leads from the high road to Chateau Auvilliers, and two in Creuzy ; the 9th Batn. Rifles was stationed in the farm of La Grange ; the 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt. in the southern outskirts of Artenay ; the 2nd Batn. nth Regt. on the north of that place in reserve. The artillery could not be used in the fields ; the ground was extremely soft, and the horses were tired, and much reduced in number. In case of necessity it would have been impossible to remove the guns, and therefore only a few were brought into position on the high road. The 4th Cavalry Brigade had pushed its outposts beyond this position in the direction of the enemy, but, with the exception of a few shots fired at Tauffenbach's column as it left Cercottes, no attempt at pursuit was made. The enemy did not pursue us till later from the direction of Coulmiers, but by a series of unfortu nate coincidences he was able to gain some trophies at a small risk. On the ioth of November, the enemy expected to be attacked by us; but as this expectation was not realized, Admiral Jaure- guiberry, in command of the ist Div. 16th Corps, sent a recon- noitring party to St. Sigismond,* found that it had been evacuated, and was informed by the inhabitants that the German troops had retreated during the night to Patay. (\" Dans le plus grand dtfsordre,\" occurs as a matter of course in all French reports of a victory.) The Admiral's staff officer with a cavalry detachment continued the reconnaissance beyond St. Peravy, and came upon the ammunition column of the 2nd Inf. Div., which was on the march to Lignerolles with two reserve guns and a number of staff bag gage-wagons, in which were five wounded officers. The heavy vehicles could not escape along the bad roads, and, with the excep tion of a few men, the whole column was captured after a slight attempt at resistance.

This loss was no dishonour to the I. Corps, but it was all the more annoying as it might so easily have been avoided. The Army Corps arrived at Toury in the afternoon (ioth of November) in good spirits, but exhausted by the continuous exertions of the last 48 hours. The 4th Brigade was in and near Toury; the 3rd Brigade, with the 5th Cavalry Brigade (Baumbach), constituted the rear-guard, and occupied Tivernon, Ondreville, Poinville, Boissay, Chapelle St. Blaise, Armonville, and Toury. The ist Inf. Div. was quartered in Barmainville, Rouvrai St. Denis, Oinville, St. Peravy, and Boisseaux. The Reserve Artillery was in Armonville-le-Sablon, Poste de Boisseaux, and Erceville. The Cuirassier Brigade was in Janville. The 22nd Inf. Div., which was always ready for any exertion, reached Janville by the afternoon of November ioth, and the 4th Cav. Div. advanced with it to Ymonville. The 2nd Cav. Div., which had its headquarters in Outarville, covered our Army towards Pithiviers ; the 3rd Brigade and the 5th Cav. Div., towards Artenay ; the 4th Cav. Div. from Ymonville, towards Patay and Bonneval. The advanced cavalry patrols brought back trustworthy intelli gence of the presence of large bodies of French troops to the south of Artenay ; but the village of Patay, in the direction of Coulmiers, was reported to be free from the enemy.* On General v. d. Tann's arrival in Toury, an order was brought by an orderly officer from the headquarters of the III. Army, to the effect that a separate Army was to be formed under the com mand of H.R.H. the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg. It was to operate especially against the Army of the Loire, and to con sist of the I. Corps, the 22nd and 17th Inf. Divs., and the 2nd, 4th, and 6th Cav.

This injunction had already been fulfilled as far as circumstances would allow ; for on the day after the engagement, at 10 a.m., the last train, conveying rolling stock from Orleans, left Artenay for Etampes. About noon on the nth of November, reports were received from the outposts, that strong bodies of French cavalry and in fantry were marching towards Artenay, and that part of them had already debouched from that place. We had every reason to believe that, if the enemy endeavoured to follow up the advantage gained at Coulmiers, it would be with even stronger forces than before, owing to the numerous reinforce ments that had been brought up. Various reasons had rendered it desirable on Nov. 9th to engage with a far superior enemy, but now these motives had no longer any weight, and it seemed unad visable to allow the enemy to obtain another victory, however slight, by his numerical superiority. This would have been the result if the I. Corps had entered upon an engagement at Toury and had then fallen back, fighting, upon the 17th Inf. Div., which had just arrived at Angerville. It appeared more desirable, first to concentrate all the forces of the Army, and then to assume an offensive or defensive attitude towards the superior forces of the enemy. A serious engagement in the neighbourhood of Angerville, where the ground favoured our artillery and cavalry, would compel the enemy to display his strength ; and in case of our obtaining a victory, he would not be able to fall back so quickly upon the protection and cover of the Bois d'Orleans. We were also compelled to take into consideration the fact that the 1. Corps, although able to accept battle, had not improved since the day of Coulmiers, whereas the enemy possessed the consciousness, so dear to Frenchmen, of having won a victory, and the certainty of being, numerically speaking, far superior to our troops.* General v. d. Tann, therefore, resolved not to enter upon any isolated or decisive engagement with his main body, but to retire towards Angerville after informing General v.

This might have proved fatal if the enemy had continued his advance and attacked us, and would have been all the more serious, as the 22nd Inf. Div. had been permitted to continue its march to Beau dreville. In the afternoon we received the intelligence that the enemy's columns at Artenay had retired. By the evening of Nov. nth, the Army Corps had taken up its former cantonments, with the exception that the 2nd Regt. of Cuirassiers and the Batteries of Horse Artillery belonging to the Cuirassier Brigade remained in Arnouville and Jodainville. An attack might be expected on the following day from the direction of Artenay. The I. Corps was ordered to maintain its position in Toury, until the 17th and 22nd Inf. Divs. could come up. Both those Divisions were to march at daybreak, the one from Angerville to Toury, the other from Beaudreville to Jan ville. The Army Corps was concentrated on the north of Toury on the morning of Nov. I2th, but the enemy did not advance, neither could any movements be detected by our outposts, which kept the touch of those of the enemy and had frequent skirmishes with them.

The conviction gradually grew, both at the headquarters of the Army and at those of the I. Corps, that the enemy, whose inac tivity was otherwise inexplicable, was drawing his forces towards the west (leaving a small detachment in Artenay), and was going to attack the line of investment either by Chartres or Dreux. The Grand Duke, therefore, wished to concentrate his forces nearer to Chartres, and the march to the right, which was to be covered by the 2nd and 4th Cav. Divs., was ordered to take place on Nov. 13th. Groben's Cavalry Brigade of the 6th Cav. Div., which had hitherto been with the 4th Cav. Div., was to return to Chartres with the 22nd Inf.

As long as we continued in uncertainty as to the enemy's intentions, the Army could not venture too far from the road from Orleans to Etampes, and was therefore obliged to maintain its general position, but the 22nd Inf. Div. moved to Chartres on Nov. 14th, and occupied that town and its neighbour hood. The Army, commanded by Field-Marshal Prince Frederick Charles, was in the neighbourhood, and the 2nd Cav. Div. was endeavouring to open communications with the IX. Corps, which was the nearest. The advance of this Army, which covered the high road, enabled the Grand Duke's Army to move more towards Chartres, and orders to that effect had been issued for Nov. 1 8th. Early next morning these orders were countermanded, because, according to the fresh order, the enemy apparently \" intended either to make a long turning movement against Versailles, or to advance against Chartres and to turn our right flank.\" The following orders were therefore issued by the headquarters of the Grand Duke: \u2014 The 22nd Inf.

All was quiet at Artenay, and at the Conie brook only Franc-tireurs had been seen. No alteration took place in the general position of the Army on November 16th, but the 17th Inf. Div. moved to Maintenon and occupied the important defile of Nogent-le-Roi. On this day, November 16th, a despatch was received from Ver sailles by the headquarters of the Army and communicated to General v. d. Tann, to the effect that the Grand Duke's Army was released from the duty of covering the Army of Investment on the side of Orleans, since the Corps commanded by Field-Marshal Prince Frederick Charles had crossed the Yonne. The 2nd Cav. Div. was detached to the 2nd Army, while the 5th Cav. Div. was placed under the orders of the Grand Duke, whose Division, having been reinforced by six Landwehr Battalions of Guards and one Battery, was in the neighbourhood of Houdan. In conclusion, a concentration of the forces and an offensive move ment against an enemy advancing from Dreux were recommended.

Bavarian Army Corps. 220 The 17th Inf. Div. was to advance from Maintenon to Dreux, and to take the latter, if weakly garrisoned, or else to concentrate in the neighbourhood of the town and remain in observation. The 22nd Inf. Div. was to leave a small garrison in Chartres, and to advance towards Fontenai by Briconville and Bilheux. If the defile in its front was unoccupied, it was to secure possession of it, and the main body was to take up cantonments or bivouacks round St. Sauveur and Marville. The 1. Corps was between Maintenon and Jouy at 9 A.M., when it received orders to halt and to move in several columns into the rayon Le Boullay-d'Acheres, Fadainville, St. Cheron-des-Champs, taking up cantonments a cheval on the road from Chartres to Dreux. The march of the 22nd Inf. Div. to Chateauneuf was to be covered by one brigade of the 6th Cav. Div., while another brigade was to push forward as far as possible towards Nogent-le-Rotrou. The 4th Cavalry Brigade was brought up to Chartres, and was ordered to reconnoitre towards Illiers and Bonneval. In this advance to the north-west, the I. Corps was not only to act as reserve to the divisions which had been pushed forward to Dreux and Fontenay, but was also to be utilized in the direction of Chateauneuf-en-Thymerais and La Loupe, on the left flank of the Army, where as yet we were in uncertainty as to the strength and intentions of the enemy.

Div. (3rd column) heard the sound of cannon on its left flank. As an attack from that direc tion would materially endanger the intended operations and should be parried as quickly as possible, the 2nd Inf. Div. was concen trated at Acheres, and sent out strong patrols to the left (west), which soon returned with the intelligence that Schmitt's Brigade of the 6th Cav. Div. was engaged with Franc-tireurs and Gardes Mobiles, who held the woods at Chateau neuf-en-Thymerais. As soon as the firing ceased, the troops took up the quarters that had been assigned to them.* A castle had been chosen for the headquarters of the Corps, the non-existence of which was only ascertained when we reached its site according to the map. General v. d. Tann took up his quarters in Challet. The 17th Inf. Div. had taken the little town of Dreux (Nov. 17th), after a short engagement with slight loss. The troops, which were defeated, consisted of Gardes Mobiles and Marines, who, being without artillery, were unable to resist the attack. The 22nd Inf. Div. had put to flight some Franc-tireurs, and its Advance Guard had reached the line Boullay-les-Deux-Eglises \u2014 - Levaville-St. Sauveur ; the main body was bivouacked and can toned in Marville and La Touche. Schmitt's Cavalry Brigade, of the 6th Cav. Div., after repulsing the Franc-tireurs at Chateauneuf, had taken up quarters in Chene- Chenu. At Houdan a band of Franc-tireurs had been repulsed by the 5th Cav. Div. The comparatively weak resistance offered by the enemy, and the composition of his troops (he displayed no artillery and but little cavalry), led to the conclusion, that no efficiently organized Army had advanced by Dreux to Houdan, and that no danger threatened the Army of Investment from that direction for the present. The Grand Duke, therefore, formed the resolution to give up the march to the north-west, and to continue his operations towards the south-west in the direction of Le Mans, in order to ascertain * Three companies of the ist Batn. nth Regt.

The following orders were issued for the movement : \u2014 The 5th Cav. Div., under Lieut-General v. Rheinbaben, while continuing to reconnoitre the country as far as the Seine, will push forward its Advance Guard to Nonancourt. The main body will advance to Dreux, and patrols will be sent out towards Evreux. The 17th Inf.

The Reserve Artillery will take up quarters in the villages of Thimert and Guillandru ; and the Cuirassier Brigade in Gatelles, Le Mage, La Bourse, Afsonville, and Morteville. The marches of Nov. 18th could not be carried out exactly in accordance with the above plan. The 22nd Inf. Div. had the enemy in its front, Morvillette being occupied by him, and in addition to this had come upon French troops in a wood, La Queue de Fontaine, which was on the left (west) of this Division.

The engagement was not terminated when the head of the I. Corps arrived in the neighbourhood of Chateauneuf, but that part of the 22nd Inf. Div., which had not been engaged, was ordered by the Grand Duke to continue its march to La Loupe,* as originally intended. The ist Inf.

Cav. Regt.), without halting to cook a meal. During the march, darkness had set in and was rendered more intense by the thick fog, which had lain over the country ever since the morning ; not a shot could be heard from Digny ; all was quiet, and it appeared probable that the Prussians had meanwhile occupied the village, but, as soon as the column had reached the first houses of Digny, it was received with several volleys. The village was still in the hands of the enemy. Our complete ignorance of the nature of the ground, the darkness, the exhaus tion of the troops, and the uncertainty as to the positions of the Prussian troops, to whose assistance we had been sent, all com bined to forbid a night attack upon Digny. The battalions there fore bivouacked on the road leading from Rouvray, after utilizing as far as possible the scanty accommodation of the neighbouring farms. The 17th Inf. Div. had commenced to march from Dreux to Brezolles, but on the way vigorous firing was heard to the south, which proceeded from Lieut.-Col. Heuduck's detachments. The troops were, therefore, halted in the neighbourhood of Laon, and detached several battalions and one battery towards the field of battle, with the intention of taking the enemy in rear. The thick fog, which rendered it impossible to ascertain our position, and necessitated increased caution, and the approach of night, pre vented this excellent plan from being carried into execution. It appears that the enemy, who was well acquainted with all the roads, passed under cover of darkness between the 17th Inf. Div. and the right wing of the 1. Corps (at St. Maixme). The night of the 1 8th was very trying to the greater part of the troops. Many detachments had been on the march since the morning, and even during the frequent halts had obtained no real rest, and were now obliged to seek their cantonments amid the darkness, which, owing to the mist, had set in at 4 p.m., only to find them either occupied by the enemy or in flames, and were obliged to drive the enemy out of their quarters or to bivouack in the cold without fires.

The general order, issued by the Grand Duke from Chateau neuf on the evening of the 18th of November, commenced as follows : \u2014 \" In to-day's advance the Army encountered opposition at almost all points. This, and more especially the victorious action in which Wittich's Division was engaged, have enabled us to accomplish our object of ascertaining the strength and position of the enemy.\" \" It appears that our enemy belongs to the Army of the West (General Fiereck), and is based upon Le Mans.\" In accordance with this view, orders were issued, that the touch of the enemy was to be maintained along the whole line, but the troops were to have a day of rest on Nov. 19th. The whole Army remained on the 19th in its cantonments round Chateauneuf-en-Thymerais. The detachments, that had been sent towards Digny on the preceding evening, resumed their quarters in Favieres, while those troops (7th Batn. Rifles, ist, 2nd, 3rd Batns. ioth Regt. and two 6-pounder Batteries), which, had bivouacked at Ardelles, were moved to Chene-Chenu. Even during the occupation of Orleans great care had been ex pended on the restoration of the railway communication with the base of supplies at Corbeil. The service between that town and Juvissy would have been reopened on the very day of the evacua tion of Orleans. As operations had now been undertaken in another direction, the Chief of the General Staff intended to utilize the railway via Dourdan and Auneau to Bonneval in bringing up supplies. A Bavarian railway engineer * had boldly reconnoitred the line between Bretigny and Santeuil with an engine, sand found it prac ticable. At the latter point, a depot for the whole Army was to be established, and to be replenished from Corbeil by means of the railway. * Railway Engineer Ebermayer. t This engine had been captured at Orleans and put in working order after some difficulty, and now did excellent service under the name of v. d.

During the further extension of the operations, it was intended to open the railway if possible as far as Bonneval and Chateaudun, which would materially facilitate the supply of provisions and materiel. A strong detachment, composed of footsore men, was there fore sent to occupy the railway stations between Santeuil and Bretigny. The march was to be recommenced on Nov 20th. The headquarter staff was anxious to ascertain whether a por tion of the Army of the Loire existed in the neighbourhood, and a reconnaissance in force was accordingly made in the direction of Le Mans, and pushed forward until within a long day's march of the town. During this operation, the presence of the Train (Reserve Ammunition and Commissariat Stores), Hospitals, and Pontoons, which were not adapted for such movements, proved extremely inconvenient, all the more so as the advance rendered our line of communications open to attack from the rear. On Nov. 20th, the troops were to carry out the following orders: \u2014 The 5th Cav. Div. will detach a regiment to Verneuil to recon noitre on the north and west. The 17th Inf.

A.M. the I. Corps was ordered to march off from the left, and to move to the vicinity of Champrond. Its right wing was to rest on the woods of Montireau and Champrond, and communications were to be opened with the 22nd Inf. Div. on the right, and the 6th Cav. Div. on the left. General v. d.

Div. had taken up its new position without any difficulty ; but the 2nd Brigade, which headed the ist Inf. Div., found that Champrond was occupied by the enemy, who had erected barricades in front of the village and armed them with guns. When the 2nd Brigade arrived, at 6 p.m., it was quite dark ; we had not even the roughest map, and were in complete ignorance of the nature of the surrounding country.f Under these circumstances it appeared unadvisable to order an attack before daybreak. The occupation of Champrond by the enemy occasioned great hardship to the troops of the 2nd Brigade, for it compelled them to bivouack without straw or provisions in cold and rain, after marching all day along bad roads. The 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt. placed outposts in the direction of Champrond, and the ist Batn. ist Regt. towards the wood. * The Mitrailleuse Battery, the utility of which in the field was very doubtful, was sent on the following day to the II.

If the enemy had established himself strongly in Illiers, he could only have been attacked by the 1. Corps on the following day, and by the 22nd Inf. Div. somewhat later. The 17th Inf. Div. had more than 24 English miles to march from Senonches to Illiers. With a view to this contingency, the reports from the outposts and the 4th Cav.

The troops marched at the hour indicated. The 1st Inf. Div. was headed by the 2nd Brigade, and the 2nd Inf. Div. by the 4th Brigade. The weather was extremely unfavourable. Those troops, that had been fortunate enough to pass the preceding night under a roof were drenched through and through by the cold rain in a very short time, while those detachments that had been completely exposed to the storm in their bivouacks, and of which only a small number had been able to cook a meal, suffered still more from the bad weather. The roads were soft and bad, the fields almost impassable, and any quick movement of artillery was not to be thought of. But little singing or merriment is to be heard on such a march. The columns waded in silence through the mud, which was knee deep, and were often delayed by trenches and barricades, which had been only partially levelled. General v. d.

DURING the last twenty-four hours the Army had advanced into a country which offered the greatest advantages in every respect to the enemy, if he understood a system of irregular and petty warfare. The irregular but continuous chains of hills, with more or less steep inclines, and often with precipitous ravines at the base, made it difficult to obtain any view of the situation, and hindered the movements of large forces in close formation, more especially of cavalry and artillery. The country was covered with thick woods and crossed by a number of small brooks, both of which formed natural obstacles, well fitted for an obstinate resistance. There were comparatively few regular villages, but a number of isolated farms, the fields belonging to which were enclosed by hedges and walls, whereby the cavalry was restricted to absolute in activity on the roads. The artillery could only obtain a sufficiently open range from certain conspicuous heights, which were not at all easy of access. The numerous plantations effectually prevented an effective fire. The aspect of the walled farms on each side of the road, and the woods shut in by considerable heights, caused some anxiety as to the fate of the large commissariat column, which that day had entered upon this country, made as it seemed to be for guerilla warfare. * The engagements of La Fourche and Thiron-Gardais, which took place on the same day, are sometimes designated as the engagement of Nogent-le-Rotrou."], [239, "Engagement of La Fourclie. 231 The 2nd Brigade marched at the head of the 1st Inf.

The remainder of the 2nd Brigade, with Soldner's and Prince Leopold's 6-pounder Batteries,* and the 1st Brigade, with the Divisional Artillery, then followed. At 12.30 p.m. the advance guard came upon the enemy on the east of the place where the road divides near La Fourche. The latter had taken up a strong position on the edge of a steep height, which runs from south-west to north-east ; the outskirts of the village of La Fourche had been prepared for defence, and the entrances to the streets barred by earthworks. The advancing skirmishers of the 9th Batn. Rifles were received with a brisk musketry fire from the enemy's ambuscades, and by degrees four guns were brought into action against us. Lieut.-General v. Stephan, who was in command of the 1st Inf. Div., had ordered the 1st Brigade to advance to the front of the 2nd Brigade, with a view to the distribution in the cantonments. The 1st Brigade was already in motion, when intelligence was re ceived of the collision between the advance guard and the enemy. To avoid any delay, and in order to attack the enemy as quickly as possible, Lieut.-General v. Stephan ordered the 1st Brigade, under Maj. -General Dietl, to continue to advance, and to take part in the engagement. The 2nd Brigade was to form the reserve, with the exception of the 9th Batn. Rifles and the 2nd Batn. nth Regt., which were already in contact with the enemy on the high road to La Fourche, and were attached to Maj. -General Dietl's Brigade. A considerable eminence, which completely commands the surrounding country, lies about 4,000 paces to the east of La Fourche, and causes the road at its foot to make a sharp bend to the south. Hutten's and Schleich's 6-pounder Batteries of the Divisional Artillery took up positions upon this height, and opened a slow but well-directed fire upon La Fourche and its entrenchments. The formation of the ground did not permit of a closer approach of the artillery to the enemy's position. Major-General Dietl was meanwhile engaged in making preparations for the attack upon the enemy's position, which was strong and appeared to be well defended. * These Batteries had been attached to the ist Inf. Div. from the Reserve Artillery."], [240, "The Operations of the i.

The 2nd Batn. Rifles (Major Wirth mann) was on the height with the two Batteries on the right (north) of the road, and was to attack La Fourche, i.e. the left flank of the enemy, from the west, and to parry any attack that might be made on that side, where the ground was very favourable to the enemy. The remainder of the Brigade (ist and 2nd Batns. ist Regt.) remained for the present on the road as a reserve, while the Battalions detached from the 2nd Brigade, with the 9th Batn. Rifles in first line, were to continue the engagement in the front. At the commencement of their turning movement, the Body Guards had encountered an obstacle in the shape of an impassable water meadow, and had therefore returned to the road, but were soon able to resume their original direction by a small bridle-road. The ist Batn. (ist, 2nd, and 3rd comps.), under Maj. Eckart, was to wheel to the right in open order and to attack La Fourche ; the 2nd Batn.

Rifles, with the ist, 2nd, and 3rd comps. in first line, had advanced to within 300 paces of the houses on the western outskirts of La Fourche, which it occupied, as well as the road from La Loupe. It soon became involved in a brisk exchange of shots with the enemy, who was completely covered and was soon forced to abandon one of the earthworks. The riflemen gradually approached to within 200 paces of the enemy's skirmishers, who were posted behind the hedges and in trenches, and at 4 p.m. they advanced to the attack with the 9th Batn.

The general distribution of the forces and the nature of the ground appeared to render it undesirable to make a second attack upon Nogent-le-Rotrou, more especially as no news had at that time (5 p.m.) been received from the 2nd Inf. Div. This Division was also engaged in a conflict, though of a less serious nature. It was headed by the 4th Brigade (Major-General Rudolph v. d. Tann), which had sent forward an advance guard, consisting of the 7th Batn. Rifles (Capt. Hoderlein), one squadron 4th Lt. Cav. Regt., and three guns from Metz' 6-pounder Battery. From Combres one comp, ist Batn. 10th Regt. was despatched to communicate with the 6th Cav. Div., which was advancing to Chassant. About noon news was received from the head of the column, that Thiron-Gardais and some farms on the northern side of the valley were occupied by the enemy. The 7th Batn. Rifles detached one company to the left, one to the right, of the road, and one company to occupy a height which was favourably situated and crossed by the road. The only position adapted for the guns of the advance guard was on the road itself, the ground being thickly wooded and intersected by hedges and ditches. The 2nd Batn. 10th Regt. came into action, and the enemy at first withdrew, but eventually made a stand against the left wing of the 7th Batn. Rifles. As no general view could be obtained, it * The enemy's retreat was so rapid that but few prisoners were made."], [242, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 234 was impossible to ascertain whether the enemy was endeavouring to penetrate between the 2nd Inf. Div. and the 6th Cav. Div. In order to avoid the contingency and to maintain commu nications with the latter Division, the three remaining comps. ist Batn. ioth Regt. were despatched to join the company that had already been sent to Chassant. A company 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. was sent to reinforce the company 7th Batn. Rifles, which was engaged in a wood on the left flank, and the 3rd Brigade was ordered to advance on the left of the 4th Brigade against the enemy's right flank. The ist Batn. Rifles (Lieut.-Colonel Schmidt), at the head of the 3rd Brigade, now opened fire and repulsed a battalion of Gardes Mobiles. The enemy was forced to retreat to Thiron- Gardais, and eventually, being unable to hold that place, to Nogent-le-Rotrou. The prisoners, of whom there were but few, reported that the enemy consisted of Gardes Mobiles, with some marine infantry and two guns. The losses of the I. Corps were as follows : \u2014 Killed, 2 officers, 3 men. Wounded, 3 \u201e 82 \u201e Missing, \u2014 8 \u201e 5 officers, 93 men. These losses fell principally on the four Battalions of Rifles, which had taken the principal part in the engagement. The other Infantry Divisions of the Army also came upon the enemy during their advance. The 17th Inf. Div. fought at La Madeleine, the 22nd Inf. Div. at Bretoncelles. The latter was opposed by two Batns. Marine Infantry, 3,000 Gardes Mobiles, one Batn. Rifles, and four guns. On the evening of Nov. 21st, the general position of the I. Corps was as follows : \u2014 Of the ist Inf. Div., the ist Brigade, the 9th Batn. Rifles, and the 2nd Batn. nth Regt, bivouacked at La Fourche, while the remainder of the 2nd Brigade was in confined cantonments in Marolles and Coudreceau. Of the 2nd Inf. Div., the 2nd and 3rd Batns. ioth Regt., and"], [243, "Engagement of La Fourche. 235 one squadron 4th Lt. Cav. Regt., were on outpost duty towards Nogent-le-Rotrou, the most advanced videttes being at Souaze ; the 7th Batn. Rifles and two 6-pounder Batteries were in reserve at Le Val,* and the ist Batn. ioth Regt. remained in Chassant. The ist, 2nd, and 3rd Batns. 3rd Regt., one squadron, and two 6-pounder Batteries stood in Thiron-Gardais ; the ist, 2nd, and 3rd Batns. 1 2th Regt., one squadron, and one 4-pounder Battery, in St. Denis. La Chalponniere, to the south of Thiron-Gardais, was occupied by the ist Batn. Rifles. The Reserve Artillery was cantoned round Fretigny, the Cuiras sier Brigade near and in Combres. General v. d. Tann took up his quarters in Montlandon as soon as the engagement was terminated. The front of the Army during the above advance (Nov. 21st) extended from La Madeleine to Chassant, a distance of 36 English miles, and the enemy had been encountered along the whole line. The five columns had met with no opposition, that they could not overcome single-handed. The comparatively great distances between the divisions, and the formidable obstacles presented by the ground, would have rendered any attempt at affording mutual support extremely difficult, and in any case impracticable before evening.f At the beginning of the day, the two Inf. Divs. of the I. Corps were compelled, for the above reasons, to form a strong reserve. The inequalities of the ground made it difficult to ascertain the strength of the enemy, and it appeared probable that we had already come into collision with a considerable part of the Army of the Loire, the position of which it was our task to reconnoitre. The Grand Duke determined to concentrate his forces, on November 22nd, against Nogent-le-Rotrou, and to attack that place from two sides. It was stated in the general order, that reports had been received to the effect that Nogent-le-Rotrou was fortified, and that a deter mined opposition might be anticipated. The following orders were issued : \u2014 The 17th Inf. Div. will advance to Regmalard, with its advance guard towards Belleme. * The 13th Regt., which belonged to the 4th Brigade, and Baumiiller's 4-pounder Battery were actually with the 6th Cav. Div. + The ist Inf. Div., for instance, was more than six English miles, according to the map, from the 2nd Inf. Div."], [244, "236 The Operations of tlie 1. Bavarian Army Corps. The 22nd Inf. Div. will take up a position on the right bank of the Huisne, and will attack Nogent-le-Rotrou from the west. The 1. Corps will attack that place on the east. The 6th Cav. Div. will advance along the road from Brou to Nogent-le-Rotrou, and detach some squadrons towards the road from Nogent-le-Rotrou to La Ferte Bernard. The 4th Cav. Div. will occupy Bonneval, if possible, and com municate with the 2nd Cav. Div. in Toury. The columns of attack will arrive before Nogent-le-Rotrou at noon. It had been decided by the headquarters of the I. Corps, that the 1st Inf. Div. should advance at 9.30 A.M. against Nogent-le-Rotrou, with its main body on the high road, and send a column by Marolles and Condreceau. The latter was to open communica tions with the portion of the 2nd Inf. Div. that was marching by St. Denis. The 2nd Inf. Div. was to leave Thiron-Gardais at 8.30 A.M., and to send a side column by St. Denis. The Reserve Artillery was to follow the ist Inf. Div. along the high road, and the Cuirassier Brigade to follow the 2nd Inf. Div. It was further ordered, that entrenchments should only be fired upon by the 6-pounder Batteries. At the appointed hours the columns began to march. Nogent-le-Rotrou was already evacuated by the enemy, who ascertained that no reinforcements could be expected from Le Mans, and retreated in disorder at 2 A.M. When General v. d. Tann entered the town, the public buildings were already occupied by the 4th Brigade, and the inhabitants were surrendering their arms. The Commander-in-Chief of the Army had issued orders to the effect that La Ferte Bernard, 12 English miles to the south of Nogent-le-Rotrou, should be occupied that same day by the I. Corps. As all the outpost duty of the 2nd Inf. Div. had for several days been performed by the 4th Brigade, the 3rd Brigade (Colonel Roth) was ordered to march to La Ferte Bernard, which it reached late at night. It had already marched over 30 English miles, and was now obliged to force its way into the place, its entrance beino opposed by several hundred Gardes Nationales and Franc-tireurs, of whom the greater number were drunk. The Corps was cantoned in Nogent-le-Rotrou and its neigh-"], [245, "Engagement of La Fourche. 237 bourhood, while the ist Brigade was pushed forward to Le Theil on the right bank of the Huisne. The voluntary evacuation of Nogent-le-Rotrou, which was ren dered important by its situation, was a proof that the enemy did not consider himself strong enough to offer any serious opposi tion, and that no considerable portion of the Army of the Loire had advanced in that direction. On the other hand, several signs appeared to indicate that Le Mans was the base, from which the detachments came, that we had already encountered, and it was possible that a large and newly-organized army was posted there. The Grand Duke resolved to continue his offensive movement against Le Mans, but he issued an order that the troops should move in echelon, so as to conceal, as far as possible, the real object of attack. On Nov. 23rd, in accordance with this intention, the Army was ordered to advance as follows : \u2014 The 17th Inf. Div. will move from Belleme to St. Cosme, and will push a strong detachment towards Mamers, whence demon strations are to be made against Aleneon. The 22nd Inf. Div. will be concentrated at Belleme* The I. Corps will be concentrated in La Ferte Bernard and its neighbourhood. The 6th Cav. Div. will march to Vibraye, while the 4th Cav. Div. will take up its duties, and endeavour to interrupt the railway communication between Chateaudun and Tours. On the 23rd of Nov., the ist Inf. Div. of the I. Corps marched along the right bank of the Huisne brook into the rayon St. Antoine-de-Rochefort, St. Martin-des-Monts, St. Aubin. The 2nd Brigade remained on the left bank in La Ferte Bernard. Of the 2nd Inf. Div. the 3rd Brigade moved, as an advance guard, to Vilaines-la-Grosnais, with its leading files as far as Sceaux, keeping up communication with the 6th Cav. Div. in Vibraye. The 4th Brigade was cantoned between La Ferte Bernard and Vilaines-la-Grosnais, but not in those places. The Reserve Artillery took up quarters extending from Aveze to La Ferte Bernard. The Cuirassier Brigade was cantoned in Cherreau and Cormes. * In the afternoon the 17th Inf. Div. had a short engagement at Belleme, in which only a few companies took part, but distinguished themselves by their valour."], [246, "238 The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. The Division of Engineers (pontoon train) in Fretigny. The General Ammunition Column in Montlandon. General v. d. Tann took up his quarters in La Ferte Bernard. With the exception of a slight skirmish between the outposts of the 3rd Brigade and some Gardes Mobiles at Joudry (to the south of Sceaux), the I. Corps encountered no opposition in executing the orders, but several detachments did not reach their cantonments till late in the afternoon. The inhabitants appear formerly, i.e. before the approach of the Germans, to have entertained very hostile, or, as the French would say, very patriotic feelings towards us, which were not in accord ance with their actions. That opposition had been intended was proved by the numerous earthworks and trenches, which were admirably constructed, not only with regard to their actual position, but also to their technical execution. That these inanimate obstacles were not supplemented by a living and powerful defence was, it must be confessed, most agree able. The isolated portions of the Army, widely separated from each other in order to cover and reconnoitre a large extent of country, and thrown upon their individual resources, would have had a hard task, if the enemy had made the most of the natural advantages of the ground. In spite of the vicinity of Tours, the seat of the Government, whence Gambetta fulminated his edicts, the Department of the Sarthe was evidently disinclined for a general rising, a fresh proof that a levy en masse of the population is as difficult to inaugurate by edicts and orders, as it is useless after a short period of resist ance.* * That the authorities were not satisfied with the attitude of the population is proved by the following rough draft, written in pencil, which was found in a desk in the town hall, and which we transcribe literally. The words in italics were underlined. \" Esprit general de la population dans la Sarthe : \" \"Villes et Campagnes frayeur du mot ripubllque. Au Mans, comme dans les villes du departement : adhesion k peine de'guisee au gouvernement actuel.\" \"Dans les Campagnes : \" \" Hostility passive et defiance ! impressions de 1848 encore vivaces.\" \" Cette situation est due k l'influence du clergi tres grande dans tout le departement 1 ! \" \" Surveiller incessamcnt le clerge\\ dejouer ses man\u0153uvres d'autant plus dangereuses qu'elles sont plus habiles et plus sourdes ! \" \" S' assurer de la fidelite et de l'^nergie des sous-presets, surtoui des maires.\""], [247, "Engagement of La Fourche. 239 On the 23rd of November, the Grand Duke received a tele graphic order from Versailles only to pursue the enemy towards Le Mans with cavalry and small detachments of infantry, and to advance with the main body towards Beaugency. On the 24th of November, the following orders were issued, and the troops commenced to march to the left : \u2014 The 17th Inf. Div. will push a detachment of cavalry towards Alencon, will close the road to Le Mans with cavalry, and will take up cantonments with the main body between La Ferte Bernard and Lamnay. The 6th Cav.

The troops frequently did not reach their quarters before nightfall, and were obliged to start again before daylight. Their equipment suffered considerably under these circum stances, as there was neither time nor daylight enough to clean it properly. The boots were the worst of all ; in many battalions they were either in a lamentable condition or had been replaced by the sabots of the country stuffed with straw. That a large number of the men became footsore was the inevitable consequence, and as they could not be left behind, on account of the general uncertainty of the situation, they were transported on carts, requisitioned for the purpose. These carts added considerably to the length of the train, and were the cause of frequent and tiresome delays during the march. Both men and horses were urgently in need of a day of rest ; at General v. d. Tann's request, an order was sent from the Commander-in-Chief, that an early day should be devoted to that purpose. Circumstances would not, however, allow of this order being carried out. On the 25th of November, the movement towards Beaugency was resumed. The 6th Cav. Div. was cantoned at Epuisay, and reconnoitred towards the Loir. The 17th Inf. Div. stood in Berfay and Vibraye. The 22nd Inf. Div. stood in Authon. The 4th Cav. Div. had left one brigade to secure the road between Chartres and Versailles, and had moved with the main bod)' to La Bazoche Gouet, whence it sent out scouts towards Bonneval and Chateaudun. The I.

The Division of Engineers to St. Agile. The General Ammunition Column to Arville. General v. d. Tann took up his quarters in St. Calais. During the evening and night of November 25th, the 2nd Inf. Div. sent in reports, which aroused considerable anxiety as to the safety of the left flank and rear of the Army. The Baggage Train had been fired upon from several places by armed inhabitants and Gardes Mobiles, and the General Ammu nition Column had encountered a serious attack. The patrols of the 2nd Inf. Div. had ascertained that Cloyes was not occupied, but that a large number of bivouack fires were visible in the neighbourhood of Chateaudun ; scouts brought back intelligence, that during the preceding night four French batteries had passed through Chateaudun. A general order received at St. Calais from the headquarters of the Army, November 26th, at 3 a.m., confirmed these reports, which at first were regarded as exaggerated. It commenced as follows : \u2014 \" During the afternoon eight bat talions and one battery have been moved from Bonneval to Brou, and it is believed that there are strong reserves,\" &c. Our situation was to say the least of it very peculiar, and might be regarded as fatal even by those disposed to take a favourable view. The Army was echelloned on a tract of country extending from Authon by Vibraye to Savigny, a distance of over 36 English miles ; the advance guard stood south of Savigny, the rear-guard in the neighbourhood of Nogent-le-Rotrou. Precautions were taken to secure the right flank against Le Mans, whence the advance of a strong force might be expected ; reconnaissances were made towards the south and south-east (Montoise and Vendome), and we were prepared for resistance in that quarter. The news was suddenly received, that considerable French forces were advancing against the rear of our column, which was 36 R"], [250, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 242 English miles in length, and that they had occupied Brou, at a distance of a long day's march from Nogent-le-Rotrou, but not quite so far from Authon. It appeared far from improbable that in the course of a few hours we should receive similar intelligence from the direction of Le Mans, where the main body of the Army of the Loire, which we had hitherto sought in vain, might be assumed to be. We will leave it to the reader to deduce for himself the conse quences that might have resulted from a double attack of such a nature. The Grand Duke soon came to a decision, and ordered a hasty concentration towards the road from Chateaudun to Brou, in order by a flank attack to force the enemy to halt in his movement against Nogent-le-Rotrou. In order to carry out the concentration, it was necessary to cover the movement towards the south and Le Mans, and this entailed the detachment of isolated troops to considerable dis tances. The trains stood between us and the enemy, and were the first to come into contact with him ; they were to advance without halting towards the road La Ferte Bernard \u2014 St. Calais, which was least endangered. The following orders were issued for the concentration of the Army on the line, Brou \u2014 La Bazoche Gouet \u2014 Arville : \u2014 \" The 22nd Inf. Div. will occupy the road Nogent-le-Rotrou \u2014 Brou during the night, and will advance as early as possible to Brou.\" \" The 4th Cav. Div. will march at daybreak to Brou.\" \" The 17th Inf. Div. will push forward two battalions, two guns, and four squadrons by La Ferte Bernard towards Le Mans in order to secure that road ; the line of retreat of this detachment will be towards Nogent-le-Rotrou.

The distance from St. Calais to Arville is 24 English miles, from Savigny to Arville 2 1 English miles. \" The I. Corps will be concentrated at Arville at 10 A.M.\" This was absolutely impossible, because the ist Inf. Div. stood in St. Calais and Savigny ; only the 2nd Inf. Div. from Mondoubleau was able to reach the rendezvous at anything like the right time. The following orders had been issued by the headquarters of the Corps : \u2014 The 2nd Inf. Div. will march at 7 A.M. from Mondoubleau to Arville, and will take up a position on the north of that place, fronting to the east.

This Division will leave two battalions, one battery, and one squadron in Sarge, to watch the road to Le Mans and Savigny, and to keep up com munications with the 6th Cav. Div. The Cuirassier Brigade will march at 7 a.m. by Berfay and Valennes to Mondoubleau, where it will join the 1st Inf. Div. As soon as the general order was received, the various trains were at once ordered to move off to Vibraye. The 1. Corps had almost taken up its position by 3 p.m., when an order was received from the headquarters of the Army, that cantonments were to be taken up, as the patrols had not come upon any traces of the enemy, f The 6th Cav. Div. continued to secure the right flank of the Army, reconnoitred in the direction of Orleans and Beaugency, and maintained its present position. The 17th Inf.

The Cuirassier Brigade occupied confined quarters and bivouacks at Oigny. The Reserve Artillery was in Arville. The Baggage Train was parked west of Oigny, the other Trains remaining in Vibraye. There was not sufficient accommodation for all the troops, and some detachments were obliged to bivouack, after a march of nine hours and with insufficient provisions. The latter could not be obtained from the villages in sufficient quantity, and the supplies from the commissariat train, which had hitherto been sent after us with tolerable regularity, were interrupted by the sudden change in the direction of the march. According to the reports, the enemy occupied the portion of the brook of the Loir between Bonneval and Chateaudun. The Grand Duke intended to attack him in that position on the follow ing day (November 27th). The following orders were issued : \u2014 The 22nd Inf.

The evacua tion of the latter was reported by an officer's patrol of the 4th Lt. Cav. Regt., and a strong cavalry detachment, followed by infantry on carts, and later by the 3rd Regt., was sent at once to Chateaudun, which place the Corps was to occupy* On the evening of November 27th, the I.

Body Guards, two guns, one squadron), had been ordered forward as far as Chatillon. The Reserve Artillery was cantoned round Marboue, the Cuiras sier Brigade round Gohory. All the trains were in Brou. The troops were much exhausted, their clothing and equipment were very defective, the horses were tired and low in condition, and the general tone was far from cheerful. The incessant and forced marches of the last fortnight, under most unfavourable conditions of weather and ground, as well as the fatiguing outpost and patrol duty in face of an enemy whom we could never grasp, and yet whose existence continually made itself felt, had exhausted the physical strength of the soldiers. In addition to this, there was no distinct military object for the attainment of which the troops could concentrate their energies ; for the bands of Gardes Mobiles, which were generally put to flight after a short fight, did not seem to the men worthy of so much trouble and exertion. The absence of any object to arouse the moral and physical capabilities to the utmost exertion, engendered a certain indiffer ence. The troops stood urgently in need of a few days' rest to recover from their fatigue, and the 28th of November was therefore set * The order was signed by Lieut,-Gen. v.

This day of rest was, however, a mere illusion for the 3rd Brigade in Chateaudun, in which town General v. d. Tann had taken up his quarters. French cavalry was observed in the neighbourhood of Varize, and the approach of the enemy was announced from Vendome. Mixed patrols of infantry and cavalry had advanced far towards Orleans and Beaugency, and had come upon the enemy in both directions ; soon after noon the 1st Batn. 3rd Regt. advanced to La Ferandiere (road to Vendome), the 1st Batn. Rifles to Nosay (road to Beaugency), and the 1st Batn. 12th Regt. to Jallans and Lutz-en-Dunois (road to Orleans). Each battalion was accompanied by half a troop of Lt. Cavalry. The patrols, that were sent forward during the night of November 28th, came upon the enemy in all directions. The 4th Brigade had sent out strong patrols from Marboue towards Civry, and had found the latter place occupied by the enemy.

An order had been received from Field-Marshal Prince Frederick Charles, that the Grand Duke's Army should effect its junction with the II. Army as quickly as possible. A forced march was, therefore, ordered for November 29th, to facilitate which the troops were to be permitted to have their knapsacks carried on requisitioned carts.* The march was to be executed in the following order : \" The 4th Cav.

ENGAGEMENT OF VARIZE. {November 2gth.) We were once more in La Beauce. After nearly three weeks of exhausting marches, the mono tonous and undulating plain appeared like an old acquaintance, whom we did not exactly regard with affection, but whose good qualities absence had taught us to esteem. The cavalry and artillery felt a sense of security, when they debouched from the valley of the Loir brook on to the wide open plain of La Beauce, leaving behind them the ground so ill adapted to their arms. The 4th Brigade (Maj. -General Rudolph v. d. Tann) formed the advance guard of the 2nd Inf. Div., which was advancing by the high road to Orgeres. The 4th Brigade consisted of the 7th Batn. Rifles* (ist Lieut. G. Kraus), ist Batn. (Major Heeg), 2nd Batn. (Major Leythauser), 3rd Batn. (Capt. Wetzger), ioth Regt., two 6-pounder Batteries (Metz, Kriebel) and three squadrons 4th Lt. Cav.

Regt., having arrived abreast of Arville, found that the enemy's infantry occupied the villages of Nobleville and Civry, the wood north of the latter, and the village of Valliere, on the north of the road. Several squadrons of French cavalry were seen between those places. * This Battalion had already lost almost all its officers, and officers had to be transferred to it from other Batns. t The 13th Regt. and Baumuller's 4-pounder Battery were on the march from Courtalain, and were in rear of the 2nd Inf. Div."], [257, "Engagement of Varize. 249 In order to force the enemy to abandon the village of Noble ville on our flank, Kriebel's 6-pounder Battery took up a position at Arville, escorted by the ist Batn. ioth Regt. and one squadron 4th Lt. Cav. Regt., and opened a well-directed fire upon the enemy's cavalry, and upon a column of infantry, which apparently intended to march to Civry, to effect a junction with the forces there. Meanwhile three companies of the 2nd Batn. ioth Regt., which headed the column, had advanced at 8.30 A.M. against Civry, and one company against the wood on the north of that place ; while the 7th Batn. Rifles, which followed the other Batn., despatched one company against the wood, and three companies to a position on a height near Civry, whence they opened a brisk fire upon the wood. Metz' 6-pounder Battery took up a position between Valliere and the road, about 2,000 paces from the wood, which it shelled, as well as a detachment of French infantry, on its march from La Chenadiere to Varize on the other side of the valley. At 9 A.M. the two companies, supported by a third, pressed down from the height, and succeeded in taking the wood. The enemy withdrew into a park, which lay on the west of Varize and was surrounded by a strong wall. The attack was directed upon this new object. Of the three companies of Rifles that had advanced south of the road to Civry, two companies forced their way into the park from the west, the enemy not having had time to make efficient prepara tions for defence. One comp, of Rifles and two comps. 2nd Batn. ioth Regt. took up a position opposite the village of Varize, in which the enemy carried on an excellent defence, and from which he completely swept the southern park-wall with his fire. Of the two companies which had taken the wood at Civry, one (ioth Regt.) penetrated into the park, while the company of Rifles turned it on the north and reached the northern entrance of Varize, whence it made an attack on the village itself. The companies, that had taken the park, also advanced against the village. The enemy, who still held his ground, was attacked from all"], [258, "The Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. 250 sides, and, as a retreat was impossible, he threw himself into the park, where after a short contest he was forced to lay down his arms. During the contest for the possession of Varize, Metz' and Kriebel's Batteries had taken up a position on the height at Civry, and were able to fire for a short time upon the park-wall and the village. The 7th comp. 2nd Batn. ioth Regt., at Villetrone, having ob served strong detachments of French infantry and cavalry with two light guns, the Officer in Command of the Brigade ordered the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. to advance from its position in reserve at Civry, to cover the right flank. The engagement terminated soon after 1 1 A.M. ; the Brigade was concentrated at noon on the east of Varize, and continued its march to Orgeres. Further pursuit of the enemy did not appear advisable, partly because the distance that had still to be traversed was consider able, partly because the main body of the enemy had apparently withdrawn at the commencement of the engagement, and had thus gained a considerable advance upon us. The only portion of the enemy's troops, that had offered any real resistance, had displayed exemplary courage, and the prisoners were extremely indignant at the bad leadership of Lieut.-Col. Lipouski, who, in order to save himself and the rest, had left them in the lurch* The prisoners nearly all belonged to the Franc-tireurs de Gironde, and were principally respectable, well-educated people from Bordeaux, who were well equipped and contrasted favour ably with other examples of these patriotic warriors, both as regards their external appearance and their whole behaviour. \u25a0 A few inhabitants of Varize (which, as before mentioned, had been condemned to be burnt down in October) had taken part in the engagement, and were now sentenced to be executed. * General Chanzy gives the following account of the affair : \u2014 \" Malheureusement la compagnie des franc-tireurs girondins qui n'avait pu se retirer assez t&t du pare de Varize, dut s'y defendre avec le plus grand acharnement jusqua la nuit et perdit presque tout son monde.\" (!!)

Div. this could not be done, as intelligence had been received that Terminiers was occupied by the enemy. An order was issued that evening from the headquarters of the Corps, that on the following day strong mixed patrols were to be sent forward by the 1st Inf. Div. towards Patay, and by the 2nd Inf. Div. towards Rouvray. In order to consolidate the union with the II. Army, some alterations had been effected in the position of the Grand Duke's Army, and the following orders were issued : \u2014 The 2nd Cav. Div., which will rejoin the Grand Duke's Army, will place its outposts on the line Bazoches-les-Hautes, Santilly, Oison, Bazoches-les-Gallerandes. The 4th Cav. Div. will remain in rear of the I. Corps at Baig nolet, and secure the side towards Bonneval. The 22nd Inf. Div. will take up cantonments a clieval on the road Orleans \u2014 Etampes, with its head at Toury. The 17th Inf. Div. will be cantoned on the road Chartres \u2014 Or leans. The I. Corps will maintain its position, will keep up communi cation with the 2nd Cav. Div. by means of its cavalry, and will place outposts at Lumeau and Terminiers. The 6th Cav.

On November 29th, the 1st and 3rd Batns. 2nd Regt., which had been detached for two months, rejoined, as well as the 12-pounder Battery (Mayr), which came from Chartres and now resumed its place in the Reserve Artillery. Reports were received on the morning of November 30th, that the patrols of both Divisions had come upon the enemy when"], [260, "252 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. abreast of Terminiers. As General v. d. Tann did not intend, without superior orders, to engage in a battle, such as might have been necessitated by the forcible capture of Terminiers, that place was not to be attacked, but only occupied in case it should be abandoned by the enemy, and until then the line of outposts was to advance from Lumeau by Neuvilliers to Faverolles. The ist Inf. Div. had forwarded a report from the 6th Cav. Div., that the latter had come upon the enemy on the preceding day (29th) at Tournoisis, and that to-day a strong reconnaissance in that direction had forced the enemy to disclose four batteries, several battalions, and some cavalry. The I. Army Corps was again in immediate contact with the enemy, and unable to take its much-needed rest. All detach ments were held in readiness for an immediate advance ; many were obliged to bivouack, or were employed on outpost duty, or as patrols along the extended line of observation. General v. d. Tann considered himself justified, in the interests of his Corps, in forwarding a request to the headquarters of the Army, that his troops might be withdrawn from direct contact with the enemy by the advance of one of the Cavalry Divisions, and thus enjoy a slight measure of repose. Circumstances, however, would not permit of his request being granted. The I. Army Corps was compelled to meet the coming emer gency, without having had time to recover from the exertions made since November 8th, and the reader must appreciate all the more fully the courage, perseverance, and self-sacrifice displayed by the officers and soldiers in the severe and continuous engage ments which ensued."], [261, "253 CHAPTER XIX. DECEMBER. ACCORDING to the general order issued by the headquarters of the Army for December 1st, no important alteration was to be made in our position. The 2nd Cav. Div. was to move more to the east, so as to cover part of the II. Army. The 22nd Inf. Div. remained in its cantonments, and so did the 17th Inf. Div., the outposts of which stood on the line Villers \u2014 Santilly \u2014 Baigneaux. The left of the outposts of the I. Corps were to touch those of the 17th Inf. Div. The 4th Cav. Div. was ordered to relieve the 6th, and was to be reinforced by three battalions and a 4-pounder battery from the I. Corps, to enable it to execute more extended reconnais sances. The general order concluded with the following words : \u2014 \" The general situation of the war necessitates great activity in patrol ling, in order to maintain the touch of the enemy, and to make him believe that an attack is impending.\" An order was issued from the headquarters of the Corps, that on the morning of December ist Terminiers should be occupied by a detachment under the command of Colonel Leonrod II. of\" the 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. This detachment consisted of two battalions, four squadrons, and two 4-pounder guns, and was to be reinforced temporarily by two 6-pounder batteries, and two squadrons 2nd Regt. of Cuirassiers which had been posted during the night at Guillonville* After occupying Terminiers, it was intended to withdraw the two 6-pounder batteries and the * These squadrons had been sent forward (Nov. 30th) to reinforce the Divisional Cavalry."], [262, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 254 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt., and to relieve the latter by the 2nd Regt. of Cuirassiers. In case the enemy advanced from Patay in the direction of Cormainville, the I. Corps, which was on the right wing of the united German Army, would be placed in a situation of con siderable danger, and it was therefore considered imperatively necessary to concentrate a strong advance guard in the space between Terminiers, Gommiers, and Nonneville, and to procure information as to the strength of the enemy's forces round Patay. The ist Brigade was to endeavour to accomplish the former object, while the Cuirassier Brigade was ordered to leave its canton ments at Fontenay, to concentrate at Terminiers,* and to advance in the direction of St. Peravy in order to reconnoitre towards Patay. Two battalions of the ist Brigade, were to act as a support, and the remainder of the Brigade as a reserve. The movements could not be completely executed, as contra dictory reports as to the enemy's position and strength rendered other measures necessary. The 1st Brigade had been divided between 8 and 9 A.M. in the following manner, in order to occupy Terminiers, as ordered on the morning of December 1st : \u2014 The 2nd Batn. ist Regt. (Maj. Daffenreither) was posted in Terminiers (it was withdrawn later to Faverolles), 2nd Batn. Body Guards (Maj. Bauer) in Faverolles, 1st Batn. Body Guards (Maj. Eckart) in Gommiers, 2nd Batn. Rifles (Maj. Wirthmann), 3rd Batn. Body Guards (Maj. Ruosch), Gruithuisen's 4-pounder Battery, Hutten's and Schleich's 6-pounder Batteries of the Divisional Artillery and 2^2 squadrons 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. in Gaubert, ist Batn. ist Regt. (Capt. Hoffmann), and two 4-pounder guns in Guillonville The 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. was posted near Terminiers, and recon noitred towards Patay. This regiment and the 2nd Regt. of Cuirassiers observed strong French columns in the direction of Patay, and the detachment of the 2nd Inf. Div., posted in Lumeau, reported the advance of French infantry from the direction of Poupry. These reports induced General v. d. Tann to decide on concen trating his troops in a position near Maladerie, which had pre- * With the exception of one squadron, which had been detached to Sancheville, in order to cover the position towards Bonneval."], [263, "December. 255 viously been reconnoitred. The ist Brigade was to maintain its position for the present, in order to cover the concentration, and was ultimately to take up a position at Nonneville. Towards noon all the troops composing the I. Corps,* with the exception of the Cuirassier Brigade and the ist Brigade, were concentrated between Maladerie and Tanon. It was bitterly cold, and at their rendezvous the troops were exposed, without any shelter, to the freezing north-east wind. About I P.M., an orderly officer of the 4th Cav. Div. brought the intelligence, that according to the reconnaissances which had been made, and the personal observation of Prince Albrecht (senior), in command of the Division, the enemy had not advanced beyond Patay, and that the 4th Cav. Div. (with the exception of Bernhardi's Cavalry Brigade, which was reconnoitring still further towards Beau gency), was returning into its cantonments. General v. d. Tann did not consider it advisable, under these circumstances, to com mence a serious attack, but ordered the troops to take up confined quarters. The Chief of the Staff rode to Maladerie to hasten the return of the troops into their cantonments, and the ist Brigade was ordered to remain in its present position till further orders. At 1.30 p.m., the greater portion of this Brigade, which was about to cencentrate at Nonneville, was at Gommiers ; two bat talions (2nd Batn. Body Guards, 2nd Batn. ist Regt.) were at Faverolles. The ist Batn. ist Regt., two 4-pounder guns, and y2 squadron 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. were on the march from Guillon ville to Nonneville, one company 2nd Batn. Rifles occupied the farm of Guillard, south of Gommiers, and the 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. stood between Faverolles and Gommiers. The Cuirassier Brigade had, meanwhile, advanced from Faverolles in the direction of the farm of Touriette, and had sent forward detachments towards Sougy, Patay, and Villeneuve-sur-Conie. All the scouts announced the advance of considerable French forces, including a large mass of cavalry, which seemed to be concentrating on the right wing of the enemy. * The three Batns. 12th Regt. and Stadelmann's 4-pounder Battery were attached to the 4th Cav. Div. as ordered, and had marched in the morning to Varize."], [264, "256 CHAPTER XX. ENGAGEMENT OF VILLEPION. {December 1st.) At 3 p.m., the order to move into the new cantonments, and the intelligence of the threatening advance of the enemy, were simul taneously received by the headquarters of the 1st Brigade at Gommiers. The situation of the ist Brigade was far from favourable, for it was standing in a completely open plain, in which the enemy could use his artillery to the greatest advantage, and could easily ascertain the weakness of our force. The Brigade was without a point d'appui, so necessary to a sustained defence, and was not concentrated. The obvious numerical superiority of the enemy led us to expect an immediate attack on both flanks, which was all the more to be dreaded, because supports from Orgeres could hardly arrive in time. The first step was to oppose the enemy at Gommiers, in order to contain him there, and thus to gain time. The nearest troops took up the following positions at Gom miers: \u2014 The ist Batn. Body Guards and one company 2nd Batn. Rifles occupied a position on the outskirts of the village, which had been prepared for defence ; Schleich's 6-pounder Battery, escorted by the 3 rd Batn. Body Guards,* was drawn up on the west, and Hutten's 6-pounder Battery, escorted by one comp. 2nd Batn. Rifles, on the east of Gommiers. One comp. 2nd Batn. Rifles formed the only reserve on the north of Gommiers, while another comp, was detached to the farm of Guillard, somewhat more to the front. * The Batn. consisted of only the 9th and ioth Corps."], [265, "Engagement of Villepion. 257 The detachments of the ist Brigade, which were at a greater distance, were brought up as hastily as possible ; those which came up first were sent into action, while those which were later joined the reserve. The 2nd Batn. Body Guards took up a position in rear of the western portion, and the ist Batn. ist Regt. moved to the eastern part of the village. The 2nd Batn. ist Regt., which was on the march from Faverolles, received an order to occupy the castle of Villepion. At the request of the Officer Commanding the ist Brigade, the Cuirassier Brigade had taken up a position in an alignment with the left wing of the troops at Gommiers, and held in check the numerous French cavalry, which threatened to turn our position. The enemy continued to display large bodies of troops, and brought a large force of artillery into position. Major-General Dietl, having attained his primary object of compelling the advancing enemy to display his strength, ordered a retreat into a position between Nonneville and Villepion. The enemy's pursuit was not active, but he continually brought fresh detachments into action, which followed the Brigade with swarms of skirmishers, and overwhelmed it with an incessant hail of bullets, in spite of the comparatively great distance. Soon after the order for the move into the cantonments had been issued at Orgeres, an officer, who had been sent to the Cuiras sier Brigade at Terminiers, brought intelligence that strong French forces, composed of all three arms, were moving from Rouvray St. Croix towards the west, thus contradicting the report that had previously been sent in from the 4th Cav. Div., and upon which the order for the move into the cantonments had been based. When this news was received at Orgeres, it was about 2.30 p.m., and the troops were already marching by brigades to their respec tive quarters. The Chief of the Staff of the Army Corps, who had just re turned to Orgeres from La Maladerie, now issued an order in\" the name of the General Commanding, for the 2nd Brigade, the head of which had just reached Orgeres, to move to Villeve, instead of into its cantonments, in order, if necessary, to support the ist Brigade, of the position of which we had as yet no certain intelligence. The 2nd Brigade, headed by the 9th Batn. Rifles and the 2nd S"], [266, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 258 Batn. nth Regt., which were followed by the two Batteries of Gramich's Division, Grundherr's 4-pounder Brigade Battery, and the remaining battalions, had already marched beyond Villeve without having heard a single shot of the brisk musketry fire, although the numerous shells that whistled through the air indi cated that an engagement was taking place in the neighbourhood of Villepion and Nonneville. The ist Brigade had meanwhile taken up a fresh position. The 2nd Batn. ist Regt. stood on the east of Villepion, and had deployed three comps., while one comp, occupied a hedge which was favourably situated. The ist Batn. Body Guards, which had received an order to occupy the park wall, was not able to execute it, as the wall was too high, and there was no time to make banquettes.* The Batn. therefore occupied, and prepared for defence, some houses in the east of Villepion. The ist Batn. ist Regt, one comp, of which occupied a farm in the neighbourhood of the village, acted as reserve to these two Battalions, while Hutten's 6-pounder Battery and Gruithuisen's 4-pounder Battery took up a position on their left, and the Cuirassier Brigade still more to the left in the direction of Faverolles. The 2nd Batn. Body Guards stood on the west side of the park, gradually brought its companies into the line of skirmishers, and by making a stand, in conjunction with the weak 3rd Batn. Body Guards, prevented the enemy from succeeding in his attempt to break through. The latter Batn., which had almost expended its ammunition in its former situation at Gommiers, took up a position in front of Nonneville. At 3.30 p.m., the 2nd Batn. Rifles, which had been rejoined by the comp, detached to the farm at Guillard, took up a position in reserve on the north of Villepion. Schleich's 6-pounder Battery was in position between Nonneville and Villepion, covered by the 3rd Batn. Body Guards. The above was the position of the ist Brigade, when the 2nd Brigade arrived in the vicinity of Nonneville at 3.30 P.M. Maj.-General Orff, who rode at the head of his Brigade, per ceived that the enemy was about to bring up fresh detachments, * The village of Villepion with its park wall, which could not be defended, was really a disadvantage and not a support to the position, for it was divided into two parts by the park and its various buildings."], [267, "Engagement of Villepion. 259 with the intention of striking a blow against the right flank of the ist Brigade. In order to parry this dangerous movement of the enemy, the 9th Batn. Rifles (Capt. Reitter), which was marching at the head of the Brigade, was ordered to deploy, in order to cover the advance of the Brigade, while the 2nd Batn. nth Regt. (Major Bohe) advanced into the line of battle on its right. The two Batteries (Prince Leopold's and Soldner's) belonging to Gramich's Division, which followed this Batn., had the greatest difficulty in taking up their positions in the ploughed fields. They took up positions between the 9th Batn. Rifles and Nonneville, a little to the west of the latter, Soldner's Battery being on the right of Prince Leopold's. At the moment when the deployment commenced, the enemy opened a terrific fire, which caused heavy losses in a very short space of time. The Battalions of the 2nd Brigade did not waver, and the detachments in first line and the two Batteries soon answered the enemy with equal vigour. The latter had advanced his skirmishers until within 300 yards ; they then halted, lay down, and swept the ground to their front with bullets. Grundherr's 4-pounder Brigade Battery followed Gramich's Division, and was to be drawn up on the right flank, but it took nearly half an hour to march from Villeve. By the greatest exertions on the part of both the men and the horses, it reached the top of a small height, but the enemy's left wing had already occupied the farm of Chauvreux, and swarms of skirmishers were visible to the north of that point. Almost before the Battery had come into position, it was attacked by a hot infantry fire, and compelled to withdraw somewhat to the rear, leaving one gun behind, of which the horses had been killed. The enemy's infantry made an attempt to capture it, but some detachments* of the 2nd Batn. nth Regt threw themselves upon the enemy with the greatest gallantry, and endeavoured to save the gun. They brought it back for a short distance, but were obliged to abandon the attempt to move it any further in the heavy ploughed ground. An artillery officers now hurried for ward with a gun limber, and succeeded in bringing the gun into safety, in spite of\" the brisk fire of the enemy. * The 6th company under ist Lieut. Harrach, and 7th company under ist Lieut. Arnold. f ist Lt. v. Stengel. S 2"], [268, "260 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. The remaining battalions of the 2nd Brigade had, meanwhile, come into action. The 4th Batn. Rifles (Capt. Wohr), in spite of 'its losses, which increased every moment, advanced on the right wing of the bat talions, which were already in position, to the top of an undulation in the ground, from which situation it replied for the first time to the enemy's fire. The other troops came up by degrees, and pushed forward between these three Battalions. On the right, the ist Batn. nth Regt. (Maj. Baumen), then the 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt. (Maj. Coulon), and the 3rd Batn. 2nd Regt. (Capt. Effner) ; in second line, there was only the ist Batn. 2nd Regt (Maj. Sauer). The enemy's fire increased every moment in intensity and violence, the nature of the ground and the superiority of his weapon being of the greatest assistance to him. The Chief of the Staff perceived the danger of the situation, and reported it to General v. d. Tann in Orgeres,* who at once directed that the 3rd Brigade should come up as quickly as pos sible. Even before Lieut. -Col. Heinleth had brought the report, that the pressure of the enemy was increasing, and that he threatened to turn the right wing of the 2nd Brigade, intelligence had been received from an orderly officer of Bernhardi's Cavalry Brigade, that that Brigade, having reconnoitred Patay and ascer tained that the enemy was still encamped there, had withdrawn to Cormainville.f The enemy now advanced in the direction of Faverolles, and endeavoured to turn our left flank, but some detachments of the 4th Brigade came into action at the right moment, and prevented any further advance of the enemy. The 4th Brigade moved in two columns from the rendezvous at La Maladerie into its cantonments. One column, consisting of the three Batns. 13th Regt., Metz' and Kriebel's 6-pounder Bat teries, and y2 squadron 4th Lt. Cav. Regt., had reached Loigny without having heard a shot, although the clouds of smoke from the French shells showed that an engagement was taking place at Villepion. When the report of the situation of the ist Brigade reached * In Orgeres not a single shot was heard. t At 5.30 p.m. this Cavalry Brigade and three Batns. 12th Regt. made a short advance, but in the meanwhile it had grown dark and the fight was over."], [269, "Engagement of Villepion. 261 Maj.-General v. d. Tann (commanding the 4th Brigade), he at once ordered Kriebel's 6-pounder Battery to advance, escorted by the y2 squadron and followed by the 13th Regt. The 7th Batn. Rifles and Metz' Battery remained in readiness at Loigny. Kriebel's Battery took up a position on the left, next to Hutten's Battery. Maj.-General Dietl had ordered his Staff Officer to watch the progress of the fight on the left flank. This officer observed the enemy's threatening movement towards Faverolles, and caused that place to be occupied by the 3rd Batn. 13th Regt. (Capt. Haag). When this Battalion reached the village, the 9th and ioth comps. were posted in the outskirts, and the nth and 12th comps. were outside in rear of the two wings. The enemy's forces, numbering about six battalions, which were followed by cavalry, had advanced to within a short distance. The two other Battalions of the 13th Regt, under Col. Ysen burg,* had deployed between Villepion and Faverolles, and had opened fire with their skirmishers. At this time (between 4 and 5 p.m.), the battle was raging with great intensity, both at the centre and on the right flank. The 2nd Brigade had taken up a position en potence, with its right wing greatly refused, and suffered considerable loss from the incessant and concentrated infantry and artillery fire. Lieut-Gen. v. Stephan had resumed the command of his Divi sion, which was now completed by the arrival of the 2nd Brigade, and he was at this moment in the most dangerous place, with the 2nd Brigade in the most advanced line of fire. He was struck simultaneously by a splinter from a shell and by a bullet. In spite of an energetic attempt on his part to remain in the engage ment, he was obliged to be carried to the rear. Majors Baumen, Sauer, and Gramich were wounded. Major Gramich had just ordered Soldner's Battery to wheel to its right rear, in order to withdraw it somewhat from the enfilading fire of a French battery at Chauvreux, and to place it in a position to reply. Prince Leopold's Battery was also in a dangerous position. The enemy's skirmishers approached nearer and nearer from the direction of Chauvreux and of Gommiers, until within 600 paces ; while the Battery was only covered by the 9th company f Body * Colonel Ysenburg had been placed in command of the detachments sent to support the ist Brigade. f Captain Hoffman."], [270, "Tlie Operations of the i.

It was easy to perceive that, if the Battery retired, the enemy would at once advance in force through the gap, and the Prince there fore resolved to hold his ground to the last moment, in spite of the danger of the situation and the losses, which were already considerable. Of the four guns,* that were still serviceable, two wheeled to the right rear and two to the left rear, and all poured a rapid fire of case-shot from this position, en poterice, upon the advancing swarms of skirmishers. The enemy was now brought to a standstill. The general situation of the ist Inf. Div., between 4 and 5 p.m., was as follows : \u2014 On the right wing and north-west of Nonneville was the 2nd Brigade, with its right wing retired, engaged in a sharp contest, and only maintaining its position with much difficulty and heavy losses. The 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. had been on the extreme right flank of the 2nd Brigade since 4 p.m., and prevented the enemy from turning the position. From Nonneville to the east of Villepion, the pressure of the enemy was contained by the ist Brigade. Hutten's and Gruithuisen's Batteries were actively engaged between Nonneville and Faverolles, and Kriebel's 6-pounder Battery had just come up from Loigny. The 13th Regt. commenced its march, and its 3rd Batn. reached Faverolles just before the enemy. The Cuirassier Brigade stood somewhat further back, between Faverolles and Loigny. The 4th Cav. Div. was at that time in Cormainville. The loss of Nonneville would interrupt the connection between the two Brigades, and would materially endanger the retreat ; as soon as the enemy's advance against that place was perceived, the 2nd Batn. Rifles was sent from its position in reserve, north of Villepion, to Nonneville, where it took up a strong position with three companies/f- (ist, 2nd, and 4th), and remained in it until the end of the engagement. \u00bb The handle of the elevating screw had been broken off one gun, and another was rendered temporarily unserviceable by the jamming of the breech. t The 3rd Comp, had been specially detached as escort to guns."], [271, "Engagement of Villepion. 263 Meanwhile it had become almost dark ; the enemy's position could only be distinguished by the flashing of the guns. Just before 5 P.M. the firing attained its maximum intensity, as if in prepara tion for a final display of force. The enemy had forced his way into Villepion on the east, and now fired upon the ist Batn. ist Regt. at a very short range.* The capture of Villepion rendered the position of the ist Brigade untenable, and it retreated towards Loigny, unpursued by the enemy. The advancing Batns. 13th Regt. were fired upon from the houses and park of Villepion. As the enemy did not pursue us, and the ist Brigade could march to Loigny without opposition, the ist and 2nd Batns. 13th Regt. and Kriebel's Battery retired slowly, and were rejoined on the way by the 3rd Batn., which had been detached to Faverolles.-f- These Battalions joined the 7th Batn. Rifles, which had advanced as far as Villours. Opposite to the 2nd Brigade the firing ceased at 5 p.m., and as soon as the 1st Brigade had commenced its march, it began to retreat, covered by the ist Batn. 2nd Regt. and the 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. The 3rd Brigade, in spite of every exertion, was unable to reach Orgeres before the termination of the engagement. On the evening of the ist of December, the general position of the Army Corps was as follows : \u2014 Of the ist Inf.

Rifles furnished outposts at Villours, and the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. at Lumeau. The Cuirassier Brigade took up confined cantonments at 9 P.M. at Fontenay, Cambrai, and St. Leonard. The Reserve Artillery took up quarters in Chateau de Cambrai, Orgeres, Villecotin, and Tout-li-faut. We should be falling into the same error as our enemies, if we attempted to depict the short engagement of Villepion as a success, or to prove that we retreated of our own free will, instead of being forced to do so. If the action was not successful, it was at least honourable to all the troops engaged. The unexpected display of powerful French forces against the isolated and disunited 1st Brigade, and the impracticability of any co-operation on the battle-field between the I. Corps and the 4th Cav. Div., were the most immediate causes of the unfavourable result. In consequence of the earnest request of the Government at Tours, the leaders of the French Army had resolved to march on Nov. 30th, with the whole Army, to Pithiviers, where they expected to find the forces in the south collected under the com mand of Prince Frederick Charles. The left wing of the Army of the Loire, namely, the 16th Corps, which had to make the longest march, was to march on Dec. 1st in the direction of Janville and Toury ; between those places and the French Army only cavalry and outposts were expected. The 16th Corps was to be followed by the 17th Corps as a reserve; while the 15th, 1 8th, and 20th Corps were to begin the advance on Dec. 2nd. In carrying out this movement, the 16th Corps, on the after noon of December ist, came upon our ist Brigade, which formed the advance guard and was supported by the 2nd Brigade and portions of the 4th Brigade, Our losses were as follows : \u2014 * The 12th Regt. was at Cormainville. In consequence of a report from that Regt., the 4th Cav. Div. had extended its outposts from Bazoches by Bourneville towards a wood on the road from Cormainville to Gaubert.

Rifles were comparatively the heaviest, namely, 4 officers and 145 men, of whom 4 men were missing. Prince Leopold's and Soldner's Batteries lost 1 officer, 21 men, and 50 horses. General v. d. Tann remained with his staff at the outposts at Orgeres. The orders for Dec. 2nd were received in the evening from the headquarters of the Army. The result of the engagement was not known at Janville at 6 p.m., when the orders were issued, and it was therefore ordered that on the following day, at 8 A.M., the troops should take up the following positions, as much under cover as possible: \u2014 The 4th Cav. Div. at Guillonville and Gommiers, the I. Corps at Loigny, the 17th Inf. Div. at Santilly, the 22nd Inf. Div. at Tivernon, east of the high road to Paris. General v. d. Tann sent a staff officer during the night to Jan ville, to report the result of the engagement to the Grand Duke, and to request reinforcements for the I. Army Corps, which would be concentrated on the next day at La Maladerie. This request, as well as General v. d. Tann's proposal that the Corps should be concentrated at La Maladerie at 6.30 A.M. on December 2nd, was agreed to by the Commander-in-Chief. The night was bitterly cold ; the troops had no shelter, and, being compelled to bivouack on account of the vicinity of the enemy's outposts, suffered greatly. In addition, the commissariat wagons were unable to find several detachments in the darkness ; and the latter, being thrown upon the small contents of their haversacks, passed the night in cold and hunger upon the frozen ground."], [274, "266 CHAPTER XXI. BATTLE OF BAZOCHES-LES-HAUTES. {December 2nd) AT 6.30 A.M. on December 2nd, the I. Army Corps stood con centrated at La Maladerie, fronting towards the south-west. The ist Batn. Rifles occupied La Maladerie; the outposts had remained in their positions, and at 8 A.M. perceived the advance of considerable French forces in the direction of Nonneville and Villepion. Soon after 8 A.M., General v. d. Tann received an order from the headquarters of the Army to take up the position Beauvilliers \u2014 Chateau Goury, and to hold it until the 17th Inf. Div. and the 22nd Inf. Div. could come up from Lumeau and Baigneaux, which would be about 1 1 a.m. The formation of the I. Corps at La Maladerie was as follows : The 2nd Inf. Div.* was in first line, with the right wing (3rd Brigade) resting on La Maladerie, the ist Inf. Div. in second line, and the Cuirassier Brigade and the Reserve Artillery in third line. The troops commenced to march off from the left as soon as the order was received. French riflemen and a few horsemen were already visible on the rising ground towards Villerand and Loigny. The day was fine but very cold ; the cutting north-east wind made the cold still more severely felt, and the ground was frozen quite hard. Of the 2nd Inf. Div., the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. (Capt. Wetzger), three squadrons 4th Lt. Cav. Regt., and Baumuller's 4-pounder Battery had passed the night in Lumeau. * The three Batns. 12th Regt. and Stadelmann's 4-pounder Battery had marched by Ormoy and Fontenay-sur-Conie, and had rejoined their Brigade at 7 a.m."], [275, "Battle of Bazoches-les-Hautcs. 267 This detachment was at first ordered to remain in position until pressed by the enemy, but was afterwards told to rejoin the Division. The 2nd Inf. Div., which stood in first line, completed the march to the left, in the formation that it had taken up in its former position. The 4th Brigade, therefore, headed the Division in two parallel lines. This Brigade (Maj .-Gen. Rudolph v. d. Tann) was composed as follows : \u2014 7th Batn. Rifles (ist Lieut.

During the march to the fresh position, the scouts, who had pushed forward towards Goury and Loigny, brought back intelli gence of the enemy's advance. An order was sent to the troops, which were advancing from Lumeau, to occupy Chateau Goury with the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt, and to hold it as long as possible. This Batn. was engaged in a slight skirmish with the enemy on the southern outskirt of Lumeau, and now advanced rapidly to Goury. Two companies occupied the surrounding grounds, one the castle buildings, and one acted as reserve. When the head of the 4th Brigade reached Beauvilliers, rapid musketry fire was already audible at Goury, the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. having reached it just before the French, whose skir mishers were already within 600 paces of the castle. French riflemen were also seen advancing towards Beauvilliers. The 2nd Batn. 13th Regt., which was in advance, was at once ordered to occupy that farm, while the 7th Batn. Rifles took up a position on the crest of a height which slopes gently down towards Goury."], [276, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 268 As the points d'appui of the flanks of the position had thus been secured against a sudden attack, the remainder of the 4th Brigade continued its march to Goury ; the three Batteries took up posi tions on the hill in the order of their arrival ; Kriebel's 6-pounder Battery on the left of the 7th Batn. Rifles ; on its left, Baumiiller's 4-pounder Battery, and Metz' 6-pounder Battery further towards Goury. The ground upon which the engagement took place may be regarded in general as a complete plain. Two slight but long undulations can be distinguished, which marked the respective positions of the Bavarians and the French. The one, upon which the I. Corps stood, runs from Beauvilliers towards Goury, and gradually and almost imperceptibly falls away at Loigny ; while in the opposite (north-eastern) direction the slope is somewhat steeper, and forms a small valley with another corre sponding undulation, which extends to the north as far as Ville prevost A similar height, if we may thus designate the very slight undulation, marked the enemy's position, extending from Ecuillon by Loigny and Fougeu towards the farm of Morale. An attack by either party upon the opposite position presented many difficulties, for the guns and rifles could be used with the fullest effect, and a successful issue, without immense loss, could only be effected by previously breaking down the defence by means of artillery fire. The French experienced this three times in the course of the engagement ; and we also learnt, to our cost, that on such ground a gallant attack would not of itself ensure success. In addition to the above, our position, regarded as a defensive position, had one great disadvantage, which was increased by the excellence of the enemy's weapons. The points d'appui of the two wings, Beauvilliers and Goury, were exactly on the crest of the height, the north-east slope of which was sufficiently wooded to prevent our batteries from taking up a position on it. They were therefore obliged to take up positions in front of the line Beauvilliers \u2014 Goury, on the slope towards Loigny, completely exposed to the enemy's fire. The advanced position of the artillery necessitated a corresponding advance in the position of the infantry, during which we suffered greatly, owing to the long range of the enemy's fire-arms. As soon as the troops of the 4th Brigade had reached Goury,"], [277, "Battle of Bazoches-les-Hautes. 269 part of them (ist Batn. 13th Regt.) were used to strengthen the garrison, and part took up a position in reserve in the castle-yard and in rear (north) of the park (3rd Batn. 13th Regt., ist and 2nd Batns. ioth Regt.). While the 2nd Inf. Div. was moving into its position between Goury and Beauvilliers, the ist Inf. Div., which formed a general reserve, took up a position in a concentrated formation between Villeprevost and the park of Goury, the 2nd Brigade in rear of the ist Brigade. The Cuirassiers were close to the right wing of the ist Inf. Div.; the Reserve Artillery was posted between Tanon and the road leading to Allaines. About 9 A.M. the 3rd Brigade, following the 4th Brigade, reached Beauvilliers. The troops which defended that farm, as well as those at Chateau Goury, were engaged in a brisk skirmish, and the enemy was advancing along the whole line. The 3rd Brigade was ordered to strengthen Beauvilliers, the point d'appui of the right wing, and to reopen communications with the 4th Brigade in Goury. The ist Batn. Rifles (Capt. Pappus, later Captain Gries) halted at the farm, extended three companies to the north-west and one company to the south-east, and at once entered into the engagement. Stadelmann's 4-pounder Brigade Battery came into action south of Beauvilliers. The remaining Batns. of the 3rd Brigade marched along the valley at the foot of the ridge that slopes down to Goury. The 3rd Brigade (Col. Roth) was composed as follows : \u2014 ist Batn. Rifles (Capt. Pappus, afterwards Capt. Gries). i ist Batn. (Major Kohlermann I.). (Colonel Schuch.) j (M^_ Vdth) ist Batn. (Maj.

Bavarian Army Corps. 270 When the Brigade deployed, abreast of the left wing of the 7th Batn. Rifles, with the 3rd Regt. in first line, the whole of the enemy's forces, composed of eight or ten battalions, was ad vancing, and the fire of his skirmishers had already caused some losses to the Batns. of the 3rd Brigade, which stood on the crest of the ridge. The enemy's rapid advance induced the 3rd Brigade to assume the offensive, without preparing the way for an attack by artillery, and without drawing the enemy on by infantry fire. The three Batns. 3rd Regt, which were in first line, began the attack with extraordinary bravery. The enemy's line, upon which the artillery had produced some effect, now halted, wavered, and fell back upon the main body, retreating more rapidly every moment. The second line, composed of the ist* and 2nd Batns. 1 2th Regt,t which had been joined by the 7th Batn. Rifles (from the 4th Brigade), began by following the 3 rd Regt. towards Ecuillon ; but, as strong detachments of the enemy were visible at Loigny and Fougeu, it wheeled towards those points. Our troops were not satisfied with having repulsed the enemy's attack by an offensive movement, but, as soon as the enemy began to waver, they pressed forward with loud cheers, in spite of their heavy losses, until they came within close range of the 1st Inf. Div. (Jaureguiberry) of the 16th Corps, which had just deployed at the centre of the enemy's position, and were forced to halt and to commence a stationary musketry engagement. This decided the result of the attack, which, although very gallant, was unprepared, and therefore premature. Our five weak Battalions stood at the foot of the slope, which rose gently towards the enemy's position, where they were completely exposed to the grazing fire of the Chassepots, and formed one line from about 500 or 600 paces east of Fougeu to the north-east of Ecuillon. They were almost 1,500 paces from our main body, entirely without reserves, and exposed to an over whelming fire.J The advance of the 3rd Brigade had been so rapid, that it was not possible to bring up supports from the ist Inf. Div. at * This Battalion only consisted of two companies, as the two others had been ordered to escort the Reserve Artillery. t The 3rd Batn. 12th kegt. was kept back in reserve to occupy Beauvilliers. % The ist and 2nd Batns. 12th Regt., which formed the nearest reserve, were already employed against Loigny and Fougeu."], [279, "Battle of Bazoches-les-Hautes. 271 Villeprevost ; the 4th Brigade was obliged in any case to occupy the principal point d'appui of the position. The ist Inf. Div. was seriously engaged in the direction of Tanon. Simultaneously with the advance of the 3rd Brigade, the 2nd Batn. ioth Regt., which had been in rear at Goury, advanced along the west side of the castle enclosure in the direction of Ecuillon, which had been taken by detachments of the 2nd Batn. 3 rd Regt. The batteries also advanced and opened a well directed fire upon some French columns, south of Ecuillon. These belonged to the 3rd Inf. Div. 16th Corps, which was advancing against Lumeau. The situation of our troops was too unfavourable to be main tained for any length of time ; they were overwhelmed by a concentric fire of shells and bullets, and soon exhausted their cartridges. They were opposed by an enemy with superior num bers and fire-arms, and could no longer hold the ground they had won. The enemy now assumed the offensive, and advanced from Fougeu and Loigny against the 12th Regt, the numbers of which were much diminished, and the right flank of which was threatened from the farm of Morale. The 3rd Brigade gradually commenced its long march to the main position, followed by the enemy's fire, which had now reached its maximum intensity and entailed heavy losses. It was about 10.30 A.M. Villeprevost was well adapted for defence, and three battalions and one battery from the 2nd Brigade had been left to occupy it by the ist Inf. Div. (ist and 2nd Batns. nth Regt, 9th Batn.

French detachments advanced from Loigny, Fougeu, and Morale in the direction of Beauvilliers and Villeprevost, and endeavoured to advance against Tanon. The possession of this place was of the greatest importance with regard to the maintenance of the position ; and, if the enemy should succeed in taking it, the right flank of the I. Corps would be materially endangered. It was also intended to make an attack in conjunction with the 17th Inf. Div., which was about to advance upon the left flank. On receipt of the intelligence of the enemy's advance upon Tanon, Major-General Dietl, commanding the ist Inf.

Schleich's and Hutten's 6-pounder Batteries took up positions between Beauvilliers and Villeprevost. The Officer in Command of the 2nd Brigade in Tanon, being aware of the enemy's advance, had ordered the ist and 2nd Batns. 2nd Regt. to advance from their position at Villeprevost. The ist Batn. occupied Tanon and its immediate vicinity, and the 2nd remained, for the present, in reserve behind the village. The two Batteries of Horse Artillery of the Cuirassier Brigade, in conjunction with the two Batteries of Horse Artillery of the 4th Cav. Div., had previously fired in the direction from which we were threatened, but were now withdrawn, as this Cavalry Division began to turn the enemy's left flank. As soon as the enemy's skirmishers, who were advancing against Tanon and Villeprevost, had been partially repulsed by the fire of the ist and 2nd Brigades, Grundherr's Battery (2nd Brigade) took up a position between those two places. In addition to these precautions on the right wing, the Reserve Artillery was ordered to open fire.

The French columns, preceded by dense swarms of skirmishers, approached closer and closer to the position at Beauvilliers (11.30 A.M.), and seemed about to penetrate through the gap between that place and Chateau Goury. The Batteries of the 2nd Inf. Div. had advanced to support the 3rd Brigade, which was retreating after making its attack ; but they were gradually driven back by the hot infantry fire, which rendered their position untenable. * Colonel Bronzetti was soon afterwards wounded by a ricochet shot, and later by a bullet in the hand. Major Schleitheim took command of the Reserve Artillery. r"], [282, "The Operations of the I.

Rifles, but were too inferior in numbers to produce much effect. General v. d. Tann now ordered the intact battalions of the 1st and 2nd Brigades to advance and hold the important point of Beauvilliers. The 2nd Batn.

Soldner's and Prince Leopold's 6-pounder Batteries took up positions somewhat further in rear of Beauvilliers, as the brisk musketry fire would not per mit them to reach the ridge. The general position taken up by the Army Corps to oppose this second attack, which was fully developed at noon, was as fol lows : \u2014 On the extreme right wing the 4th Cav. Div. was turning the vil lages of La Maladerie and Orgeres on the enemy's left flank. The 4th Cav. Div. was followed by the Cuirassier Brigade, on the right wing of the second line. By this movement Prince Albrecht (senior) prevented the numerous French cavalry from turning our posi tion, and, later on in the engagement, assisted in forcing the enemy to retire by threatening his communications with Patay. Two squadrons (ist and 3rd) 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt., which until the 4th Cav. Div. appeared, had watched the enemy's left wing from Orgeres, now rejoined their regiment. As soon as the cavalry commenced the turning movement, the detachments of the 2nd Brigade at Tanon (ist and 2nd Batns. 2nd Regt.), followed on the left rear by the troops that had hitherto been engaged in Villeprevost (ist and 2nd Batns. nth Regt, 9th Batn.

Most of the battalions of the ist Brigade had come into action, between 1 1 A.M. and noon, in the space between the farm of Beau villiers and the 2nd Brigade. On the extreme right wing, the 9th company Body Guards was mixed with the troops of the 2nd Brigade. More to the left came the ist Batn. 1st Regt., 3rd Batn. Body Guards (ioth and nth comps.), 2nd Batn. Body Guards, and 2nd Batn. ist Regt. Towards noon all these detachments had responded to the second French attack by an offensive move ment, which was led by two companies (5th and 8th comps. Body Guards)* with unequalled bravery, and in the course of which several detachments advanced past the farm of Morale, as far as the above-mentioned stable. This attack of the ist Brigade could not be concentrated as much as that of the 2nd Brigade, partly because the battalions were brought into action successively, as they were required, partly because some detachments fell short of ammunition during the hot musketry engagement, and principally because the left flank of the whole of the ist Brigade was endangered by the enemy's continued advance towards Beauvilliers. These causes combined to prevent the various and gallant attacks of the ist Brigade from attaining any lasting result. Beauvilliers, in the very centre of the position, was the point round which the battle raged most fiercely. The 7th Batn.- Rifles, 2nd Batn. Rifles, ist Batn. Body Guards, together with the 4th Batn. Rifles, and 3rd Batn. 2nd Regt, which had just been sent from the 2nd Brigade, had gained ground in the direction of Morale and thus secured Beauvilliers, which was now occupied by the 3rd Batn. 1 2th Regt, the 2nd Batn. 13th Regt. having exhausted its ammunition. Chateau Goury was held by the 4th Brigade, and the second attack upon that place, which was made at 11.30 p.m., having failed, no immediate danger appeared to threaten the castle. The 4th Brigade met that attack by a counter attack of the ist Batn. ioth Regt., followed by the 3rd Batn. 13th Regt. and three comps. 1st Batn. 13th Regt.

Ehrne-Melchthal. T 2"], [284, "276 The Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. The second line as well as the reserve consisted at this time (noon) of the 3rd Brigade, which had been much weakened, and was collected in the hollow between Beauvilliers and Villeprevost. When the 3rd Brigade was forced back to Beauvilliers, its retreat was covered by the artillery and the 3rd Batn. 12th Regt., while the 4th Lt. Cav. Regt. galloped forward and thus drew off some of the pressure from the infantry. The artillery formed the central point, round which all the troops, along the whole line from Morale to Goury, concentrated their attack and their defence, and it furnished a fresh instance of its great efficiency ; for it was due to the perseverance and self sacrifice of this arm of the service that the critical period ended favourably. The gallant deeds of the artillery on December 2nd proved the fallacy of the theory, that batteries would only be effective at long ranges. Every battery of the I. Corps stood on that day exposed to infantry fire, and maintained its position until the enemy's skirmishers were within 400 paces. Several batteries were attacked by the French skirmishers in front and on both flanks, and were obliged to fire in several directions at once ; in other cases it required the greatest exertions on the part of both officers and men, to save the guns of which the horses had been killed.* At the time we are speaking of, seven batteries (Olivier, Ma laise, Kriebel, Reder, Grundherr, Hutten, Bock) had taken up posi tions between Morale and Beauvilliers ; while Stadelmann's, Bau mliller's, Carl's, Neu's, and Metz' Batteries were in action between Beauvilliers and Goury. In the preceding account we have endeavoured to give a clear idea of the position of the I. Corps at noon. The fire continued with unabated intensity ; a hail of shells fell incessantly upon Goury, Beauvilliers, and the 2nd Brigade at Morale, and the enemy seemed to be preparing for another attack upon Chateau Goury. The garrison of that place occupied the buildings, to defend itself against a third attack, but fell short of ammunition, a want which could not easily be supplied. -f- * Reder's Battery repulsed some infantry, which advanced within short range, by its fire, then pursued the enemy, took up a more advanced position and found the colours of a French Regiment under the bodies of the fallen soldiers. f A misunderstanding occurred by which much time was lost. One Battalion of the garrison of Goury (3rd. Batn. 13th Regt.) was armed with Werder rifles, and therefore could not use Podewil ammunition."], [285, "Battle of Bazoches-les-Hautcs. 277 The 17th Inf. Div. had been ordered to make an attack from Lumeau at 1 1 A.M., but at that place its advance guard came upon superior French forces (3rd Inf. Div. 16th Corps), and it was obliged to await the result of that engagement before attempting to support the I. Corps. The 22nd Inf. Div. should have wheeled to the right at Baigneaux and joined in the engagement round Loigny, but it was attacked from Poupry by the 15th Corps (French), and was engaged in a severe contest. General v. d. Tann remained with his staff on the road from Beaugency to Morale, whence he conducted the engagement. Two Prussian officers, who were bringing reports, were severely wounded close to him ; but he and his staff remained un injured.* The Grand Duke continually requested us to stand fast, and all that General v. d. Tann could ask in the interest of his battalions was, that the 17th Inf. Div. might attack as soon as possible, in order that he might, in conjunction with it, assume the offensive, and abandon his present defensive attitude, which led to such heavy losses. About 1 P.M. a cloud of French skirmishers, followed by columns, advanced against the west and south-west of Chateau Goury. The garrison occupied every loophole, window, and crevice, and strict orders were issued that the enemy was not to be fired at until within easy range. He approached nearer and nearer, his efforts being concentrated on Chateau Goury. A hot fire was opened upon him ; detachments of the 3rd Batn. 13th Regt. and 1st Batn. ioth Regt. made a counter attack in close formation, and at the same moment a Brigade of the 17th Inf. Div. advanced in excellent order and attacked the right flank of the French ; there was a short pause, and then the enemy, completely taken by surprise, retreated in disorder to Loigny. On the appearance of the 17th Inf. Div., the first line of the I, Corps made a general advance. The victory was won ! f * In the evening, near Loigny, General v. d. Tann was struck on the boot by a bullet. f This portion of the 17th Inf. Div. executed the grateful and brilliant task of striking the decisive blow, with fresh and intact troops, after a hard-fought battle. We were, of course, delighted that the reinforcement was so effective ; but, to prevent mis-"], [286, "278 The Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. The 17th Inf. Div. advanced as far as Loigny, and fought for some hours with its usual bravery against the intact troops of the 17th French Corps. The Grand Duke ordered two 6-pounder Batteries (Carl and Neu) to be detached from the I. Corps to the 17th Inf. Div. ; and these Batteries, after being frequently exposed to infantry fire and after suffering considerable losses, took up a position on the east of Loigny, and shelled that place, which the French held with such tenacity. Before the I. Army Corps could complete the turning move ment on the enemy's left wing, commenced by the 2nd Brigade, it was necessary to reorganize the troops, which had been mixed together during the wavering fortunes of the fight, and to supply them with fresh ammunition. The detachments of the 1st Brigade were collected at Beau villiers, the 2nd Brigade was concentrated in the neighbourhood of Morale, and was rejoined by the 3rd Batn. 2nd Regt. and 4th Batn. Rifles, which had been used in direct support of the ist Brigade. The latter Battalion had pursued the enemy without any sup port, and had suffered considerable loss. The 3rd Brigade formed up between Beauvilliers and Villepre vost ; while the 4th took up a position in readiness on the west of Goury, which it had defended for four hours. The artillery, especially the batteries of the Reserve Artillery, kept up a constant fire upon Loigny and the French troops on the west (in rear) of that place. About 2.30 p.m., General v. d. Tann ordered the 1st Inf. Div. to continue turning the enemy's left flank, and to press forward against Nonneville and Villepion. (The ist Brigade had meanwhile joined the 2nd.) The 3rd Brigade marched from Beauvilliers towards Morale, while the 4th Brigade endeavoured to support the 17th Inf. Div. The ist Inf. Div. gradually wheeled to the left and fronted towards the south, the right wing being opposite Nonneville, and the left opposite the castle and park of Villepion. The 4th Brigade moved to the west of the road from Loigny to conception, we must state that the defenders of Chateau Goury had no idea at that time of giving up. The capture of Goury, mentioned by General Chanzy, is an error, and probably intentional,"], [287, "Battle of Bazoches-les-H antes. 279 La Maladerie, and took up a position in readiness for action ; the 2nd Batn. ioth Regt. drove the enemy out of the western portion of Loigny, from which village shots continued to fall. The turning movement of the ist Inf. Div., and the advance of the 4th Cav. Div. and the Cuirassier Brigade on the right towards Gaubert, compelled the enemy to make a complete change in his line of battle ; the whole of his left wing was driven back, and maintained its hold upon Villepion with difficulty. The ist Inf. Div. moved into first line and now advanced. Of the 2nd Brigade, the 9th Batn. Rifles replenished its ammu nition in Villeprevost, placed itself at the head of the Brigade and took a small wood on the north of Villepion, in which it took up a strong position. The ist Batn. 2nd Regt. passed the 9th Batn. Rifles, and advanced against the park of Villepion. It was re ceived with the most violent musketry and mitrailleuse fire, as were also the 3rd Batn. Body Guards* and ist Batn. ist Regt, which advanced on the right of the most advanced line of the ist Brigade against Villepion, led by the Officer Commanding the Body Guards. The enemy seemed determined to hold that place at whatever cost, in order to secure his line of retreat ; and it therefore ap peared unadvisable to attack Villepion in the fast increasing dark ness, with troops which were in reality much fatigued, although excited by their success. We could reckon, with tolerable cer tainty, on the enemy evacuating the place during the night. Nearly all the artillery of the 1. Corps continued to direct its fire upon Villepion and the retreating columns of the enemy. About 4 P.M. the artillery was disposed as follows ; \u2014 On the extreme right wing, at Nonneville, were the two batteries of the Cuirassier Brigade, which almost took the enemy's position at Villepion in reverse. On the right wing of the 1st Brigade were Gruithuisen's, Prince Leopold's, and Soldner's Batteries, while Olivier's, Malaise's, Reder's, Bock's, Mayr's, Metz', Baumuller's, Kriebel's, and Grundherr's Batteries extended from the left wing of the 2nd Brigade towards Fougeu. About 80 guns were thus firing upon the enemy. Nightfall finally brought the sanguinary engagement to a close. * Some of the Ersatz Reserve arrived on the field of battle, and were at once distributed and brought into action."], [288, "280 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. The original intention of the enemy, on Dec. 2nd, was to con tinue the movement commenced on the preceding day against Janville and Toury. The first attack upon the position at Beauvilliers and Goury was undertaken by the 2nd Inf. Div. (Bary) of the 16th Corps ; but this attack, owing, according to General Chanzy's account, to in sufficient preparation, was so completely unsuccessful, that for the rest of the day the defeated division was completely demoralized and could not be relied upon. Our batteries at Goury inflicted heavy losses upon the 3rd Inf. Div. {Maurandy), the head of which afterwards came into collision with the 17th Inf. Div. at Lumeau.* The sudden counter attack of the 3 rd Brigade was the chief cause of the defeat of the French 2nd Inf. Div., and this result is sufficient to excuse, if not to justify, the attack. The courage and energy displayed by the five battalions during the attack were sufficient to make a whole French Division unser viceable for the remainder of the day.-f- We learn from General Chanzy's report that the movement of the 2nd Brigade, 4th Cav. Div., and Cuirassier Brigade against his left flank created serious uneasiness. He says : \" Des qu'il s'apercut \" (that is, the Germans) \" que notre droite n'etait plus a craindre, il en vint a la man\u0153uvre qui lui a tant de fois reussi et changeant son ordre de bataille, il se porta en masse sur notre gauche avec l'intention de la tourner. On l'apercut distinctement dirigeant ses colonnes sur Tanon et prenant une position d'equerre, en avant de la Maladerie ou apparaissait en meme temps une nombreuse cavalerie.\" A Brigade of the ist Inf. Div. of the 16th Corps took up a position en potence to oppose this flank attack. The fact that at noon the French General expressed his con viction, that \" Nous avions evidemment affaire a un ennemi tres superieur en nombre,\" is highly to the credit of the 17th Inf. Div. and the I. Corps. The latter had only a strength of 14,800 bayonets. The losses of the Army Corps were considerable. * V. Chanzy, p. 71. t The enemy's Division, which was repulsed, had retreated as far as the castle of Villepion, \" presque tout entiere et en desordre.\" The 3rd Inf. Div. (French), which was defeated by the 17th Inf. Div. at Lumeau, was able to maintain its position in the first line, and even made a second attack, which was repulsed with losses on both sides."], [289, "Battle of Bazoches-les-Hautes. 281 Killed, 15 officers, 283 men. Wounded, 85 \u201e 1,718 \u201e Missing, \u2014 \u201e 202* \u201e 100 officers, 2,203 men. The total losses of two days thus amounted to 137 officers and 3,105 men. The 3rd Brigade suffered the greatest loss, namely, 39 officers and 765 men, the 12th Regt. of this Brigade alone losing 23 officers and 399 men, and it must be remembered that the strength of the whole Brigade was only 115 officers and 3,936 men. Of the single battalions, the following suffered the heaviest losses : of the ist Batn. 12th Regt, 8 officers and 101 men were either killed or wounded, out of a total strength of 1 1 officers and 263 men (the Batn. only had two companies) ; and of the 4th Batn. Rifles, 6 officers and 181 men were left on the battle-field, out of a total of 13 officers and 450 men. The firing having ceased along the whole line, the wearied troops either moved into confined cantonments, which they were often obliged to share with wounded friends and foes, or else bivouacked on the frozen fields. In the latter case, the bitter cold, the want of straw, and the very scanty nourishment prevented the soldiers from deriving much benefit from the repose. The ist Brigade passed the night in Orgeres ; the 2nd Brigade in Villerand, Frileuse, Villeve, and Villepereux ; the 3rd Brigade occupied cantonments in La Maladerie and Tanon ; the 4th Brigade in Loigny and Fougeu. f The Cuirassier Brigade and the 4th Cav. Div. had retired at the approach of night, and took up quarters in Baignolet, Bercis, and Boissay ; the Reserve Artillery was in and around Chateau Cambrai. General v. d. Tann took up his quarters in Orgeres. The orders for the following day were issued late at night by the headquarters of the Army, according to which the 11. Army would secure the road Orleans \u2014 Etampes with the IX. Corps, in order that the Grand Duke's Army might operate more freely. The orders for the latter Army were, in general, as follows : \u2014 The 22nd Inf. Div. will maintain its position at Poupry, and cover the road Orleans \u2014 Chartres. * Inquiries in 1872 prove that half of these were killed. f The 2nd and 4th Brigades furnished the outposts."], [290, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 282 The 2nd Cav. Div. will concentrate on the left wing of the 22nd Inf. Div. and will assist the latter. The 17th Inf. Div. will advance to and occupy Patay, and will endeavour to re-establish the touch of the enemy. Two brigades of the 4th Cav. Div. will be between Lumeau and Loigny at 8 A.M., will support the 17th Inf. Div., and will be placed under the orders of the Officer Commanding that Division. One brigade of this Cav. Div. will occupy and watch both banks of the Conie Brook. Three battalions and one battery of the I. Corps will be attached to that brigade. The I. Corps will be a cheval on the road Chartres \u2014 Sougy at 8 A.M. Three battalions and one battery are to be detached to the Cavalry Brigade at the Conie Brook. On the 3rd of December, at the hour specified, the Army Corps was to be drawn up at Loigny, with the 2nd Inf. Div. on the east and the ist Inf. Div. on the west of the road ; the Reserve Artillery being in rear of the 2nd Inf. Div., and the Cuirassier Brigade in rear of the 1st Inf. Div. At 7.45 A.M., before the 1. Corps had taken up its position at Loigny, the order was countermanded. Field-Marshal Prince Frederick Charles intended to attack the enemy that day in his position in the Forest of Orleans, and the right wing of the 2nd Army (the IX. Corps) was directed against Artenay, which place was to be attacked at 9.30 A.M. The Grand Duke's Army was to flank the advance of the 2nd Army on the line Gidy \u2014 Cercottes. The 22nd Inf. Div. was to be at Poupry at 9.30 A.M., in readiness to flank the IX. Corps. The 2nd Cav. Div. was to be concentrated at the same hour, on the left of the 22nd Inf. Div. The 17th Inf. Div. was to be drawn up at Anneux, and the I. Corps at Lumeau, at 9.30 A.M. One brigade of the 4th Cav. Div. was to continue in observation at the Conie Brook, while two brigades were to unite at Loigny. Somewhat later, General v. d. Tann received a verbal intimation, that the division on the left wing (2nd Inf. Div.) would probably be required to form the general reserve. In accordance with the general order, the 3rd Regt. and Stadel mann's 4-pounder Battery were detached to the brigade of the 4th Cav. Div. at the Conie Brook."], [291, "283 CHAPTER XXII. BATTLE OF ARTENAY. {December 3rd.) THE active part taken by the I. Corps in the battle of Artenay was but slight ; its task was indeed of importance, but, after the complete defeat and demoralization of the enemy on the preceding day, of easy execution. The Army of the Grand Duke, especially the I. Corps and the 4th Cav. Div., was eventually to support the attack upon Artenay, and meanwhile to prevent the enemy's detachments, which had retired towards Patay, from making a flank attack. Before the march to Lumeau was commenced, a report was re ceived, that Villepion was occupied by the enemy, and that con siderable French columns were retreating from Gommiers towards Patay. General v. d. Tann, therefore, ordered the Cuirassier Brigade to march by Villepion and Terre-noir upon Neuvilliers, in order to cover the extreme right flank, and gave instructions that flank patrols should advance by Faverolles to Echelles. A column, under the command of Colonel Leonrod II., consisting of the 2nd Batn. Rifles, ist Batn. Body Guards, and 3 squadrons 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt, was to form the first support, and was to march by Villours. About 80 prisoners and six ammunition wagons were captured by the 2nd Batn. Rifles, with the assistance of detachments of the ist Regt. of Cuirassiers, which had ridden boldly towards Villepion, although fired on from the park wall. The Cuirassiers were fired upon by artillery from the direction of Terminiers. The I. Corps was protected by the Cuirassier Brigade against any"], [292, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 284 sudden attack on the right flank, and its main body marched over part of the battle-field of the previous day to Lumeau, where it took up a position and remained in readiness. About 1 1 A.M., an order was received from the Grand Duke, for the 2nd Inf. Div. to follow the 17th Inf. Div. as a general reserve, and for the remainder of the Corps to advance by Sougy, in order to parry any flank attack. The 2nd Inf. Div., headed by the 4th Brigade, marched at once by Anneux, Domainville, Boissay, Murville, and Beaugency to Chevaux. The remainder of the Corps marched in one column, by Domain ville and the farm of Egron, along the old Chartres \u2014 Orleans road. The ist Brigade formed the Advance Guard, was followed by the Reserve Artillery, and then by the 2nd Brigade. The flanking columns rejoined the main column during the march, the 4th Cav. Div. having undertaken to cover the right flank ; the Cuirassier Brigade formed the rear-guard, while the detachments of the ist Inf. Div. rejoined their brigade, and the 3rd Cav. Regt. moved on to the head of the column. The ist Brigade consisted of five battalions, the ist Batn. ist Regt. being engaged in escorting prisoners. Hutten's and Schleich's 6-pounder Batteries and one squadron (4th) 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. were attached to the ist Brigade. About 3 P.M., on the south of Sougy, the scouts came upon the enemy, who was drawn up north of Trogny, and had occupied that place. The ist Brigade deployed, with Hutten's 6-pounder Battery and 2nd Batn. Body Guards on the right (west) of the road to Trogny, and Schleich's 6-pounder Battery and the 3rd Batn. Body Guards on the left (east). The ist Batn. ist Regt and Gruithuisen's 4-pounder Battery remained for the present in reserve. As soon as the news was received that the enemy was advanc ing from l'Encornes upon the western side of Sougy, the latter detachments were brought up from the reserve and placed on the right flank, where Gruithuisen's Battery took up a position close to two Batteries of the 4th Cav. Div., which had just come up. The ist Batn. Body Guards had been with the flanking column, and now came up and occupied Sougy with three battalions (9th Batn. Rifles, ist and 2nd Batns. nth Regt.) and Soldner's 6-pounder Battery of the 2nd Brigade."], [293, "Battle of Artenay. 285 The enemy, on the north of Trogny, had meanwhile been forced to retire by the fire of Hutten's and Schleich's Batteries. The 3rd Batn. Body Guards advanced upon Trogny from the left wing, while a charge was made simultaneously by the 4th squadron 3 rd Lt. Cav. Regt, led by the Colonel of the Regiment (Col. Leonrod II.). This squadron pursued the retreating enemy and made about 80 prisoners, including several officers, and was about to retire, when it suddenly came under a heavy fire of bullets and shells from some entrenchments, lying more to the south. The squadron was obliged to retreat at a trot, in order to avoid serious loss, and only brought in such prisoners as could be forced to keep up by blows with the flat of the swords. Meanwhile the 3rd Batn. Body Guards had continued its advance against Trogny with the 9th comp, thrown out as skirmishers. The place itself had been evacuated, but a hot fire was kept up from the entrenchments in its rear. The 9th comp.* pursued the enemy through the village, and drove him out of his entrench ments. The darkness and the enemy's hasty retreat -f now brought the engagement to a close. At Sougy, an order had just been received from the Grand Duke, for the troops to advance as far as La Provenchere. The 3rd Regt., which had been attached to Hontheim's Brigade of the 4th Cav. Div., and Stadelmann's 4-pounder Battery had advanced, about noon, by La Maladerie and Orgeres to Cormain ville. The 3rd Batn. (Maj. Veith) was ordered to march to Bazoches-en-Dunois, where it received a further order to occupy Varize and Nottonville. A strong detachment of French infantry had taken up a position in a wood on the north-east of Varize. A musketry engagement now commenced, which lasted for several hours, during which the enemy twice attacked the 3rd Batn. 3rd Regt, but was beaten back on each occasion with loss. At that late hour it was not to be expected that reinforcements could come up * This company, which we had frequently occasion to mention in speaking of the engage ments of the ist and 2nd Dec., had now been reduced to three weak subdivisions. + A comical proof of the haste with which the retreat was made and of the military ardour of the Gardes Mobiles was furnished by a great number of trousers, which were found on the road, some of which were slit up at the side, the former possessors of these articles of clothing having adopted that expedient to expedite their change of costume."], [294, "286 The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. in time from Cormainville, where the other Batns. 3rd Regt. were cantoned, and Maj.-General v. Hontheim ordered the 3rd Batn. to cease firing, and to move into quarters in Bazoches-en-Dunois. It was ascertained by reconnaissances that the enemy's forces, consisting of a few battalions and some cavalry, had retired in the direction of Chateaudun. On the left wing of the French, the 16th and 17th Corps, * both under the command of General Chanzy, had continued their retreat towards the entrenchments, which had been thrown up round Orleans. In the afternoon, the sound of cannon was heard in the direction of the 15 th Corps (French) at Artenay and Chevilly, and the 2nd Inf. Div. 16th Corps was ordered to advance to Sougy, where the above-mentioned short engagement took place. A brigade, under Colonel Paris, which was to be attached to the 17th Corps, had just arrived at Chateaudun, and was ordered to move along the Conie Brook to Patay. Troops belonging to this brigade, probably the rear-guard, had been engaged with the 3rd Batn. 3rd Regt. Our losses were very insignificant. Killed, 2 officers, 4 men Wounded, 1 officer, 16 \u201e 3 officers, 20 men. On the evening of the 3rd December, the position of the 1. Corps was as follows : \u2014 The main body of the ist Brigade was in La Provenchere, the 3rd Batn. Body Guards in Trogny, the 2nd Batn. Body Guards on outpost duty. Of the 2nd Brigade, the ist and 2nd Batns. nth Regt., 9th Batn. Rifles, and Soldner's 6-pounder Battery were in Sougy ; the remainder of the Brigade was partly in confined cantonments, partly in bivouacks and at La Provenchere. The 2nd Inf. Div. was bivouacked and cantoned in Chevaux. The Cuirassier Brigade was bivouacked at Les Grandes Bordes, the Reserve Artillery at Trogny. * General de Sonis, commanding the 17th Corps, who in person had led his troops under fire on the preceding day, when they were sent forward to support the 16th Corps, had been severely wounded at Loigny."], [295, "Battle of Artenay. 287 Towards evening it began to rain heavily ; but during the night, and especially towards the next morning, it became bitterly cold, with a cutting east wind, which the troops in bivouack felt all the more severely from their clothes being soaked with rain. The orders for Dec. 4th were received at 1 A.M. Field-Marshal Prince Frederick Charles had ordered the whole Army to march against Orleans, and the following orders were therefore issued for the Grand Duke's Army : \u2014 The 17th Inf. Div., to which a regiment of the 2nd Cav. Div. is to be attached, will push forward its advance guard at 7 a.m. to Gidy, followed by the main body at 8 A.M. ; if no opposition is encountered at Gidy, the march to Orleans will be continued. The 22nd Inf. Div. will follow the 17th Inf. Div. at 8 A.M., and will be under the orders of the Grand Duke. The 2nd Cav. Div. will follow the 22nd Inf. Div. The 1. Corps will concentrate, at 8 A.M., at La Provenchere, and will advance by Janvry in the direction of Orleans. The 4th Cav. Div. will advance by Huetre and Boulay along the high road to Orleans, leaving one brigade, with the three Bavarian battalions, to reconnoitre and secure the ground towards the west, more especially towards Beaugency. During the bitterly cold night a number of deserters arrived at the outposts, and reported that the enemy was in retreat and had had enough fighting. The aspect of these half-starved and frozen soldiers hardly prepared us for the determined resistance which we encountered during the next few days at Beaugency. At 7 A.M. on December 4th, the 1. Corps was drawn up at La Provenchere. We were greeted by some shells from the earth works at Gidy, which were armed with ships' guns of heavy calibre. They struck the ground in front of our troops, without doing any harm. It seemed almost as if the French artillerymen had merely fired off the guns in order to unload them, for after six or eight shots the entrenchments were evacuated, and the guns abandoned without being spiked."], [296, "288 CHAPTER XXIII. BATTLE OF ORLEANS. {December 4th.) At 8 A.M. the I. Corps left La Provenchere and commenced the advance as ordered. The day was fine and clear, but very cold ; the icy north-east wind still swept over the frozen fields. The advance was made in Ahelon from the left. The ist Inf. Div. formed the left wing, and was headed by the 2nd Brigade ; the 2nd Inf. Div. marched on the right, slightly refused, with the 4th Brigade in advance. The Cuirassier Brigade followed on the right rear of the 2nd Inf. Div. On the extreme right wing of the whole Army, which was advancing towards Orleans, the 8th Cav. Brigade (Maj.-General v. Hontheim, ioth Lancers, 25th Cuirassiers) marched with the 3rd Regt. and Stadelmann's 4-pounder Battery from Cormainville to Patay. Between this flanking detachment and the right wing of the I.

Regt. The scouts crossed the ridge between Huetre and the farm of Meules, and approached the village of Bricy, from which they were fired upon. The ground between Huetre and Bricy was completely open, and rose slightly towards the latter place ; it was necessary to open an artillery fire upon Bricy, before the infantry could attempt to storm the position, a difficult one to attack. The three batteries of the 2nd Brigade took up a position on the right (west) of the farm of Meules, and opened fire upon Bricy. The battalions of the Advance Guard deployed on the left of the artillery; the 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt. was nearest to the artillery; then came the 3rd Batn. 2nd Regt., and then the 9th Batn. Rifles on the left wing. The 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. was divided, and in 'rear of both wings. The remainder of the 2nd Brigade, as well as the ist Brigade in second line, remained under cover, in rear of the ridge. Detachments of the enemy were shortly afterwards seen retreating hastily from Bricy towards Boulay. Meanwhile the 2nd Inf. Div. had moved into first line, on the right of the ist Inf. Div. The 4th Brigade marched at its head, under command of Major-General v. d. Tann, and was composed as follows : \u2014 7th Batn. Rifles (ist Lieut. Rehm). ioth Regt. [ ist Batn. (Major Heeg). (Lt.-Col.

The 4th Brigade was in front, with the three Batns. ioth Regt. and the 7th Batn. Rifles in first line, the three Batns. 13th Regt. in second line, and the three Batteries in third line. The 3rd Brigade was in rear, as a reserve, and was also in three lines. On receipt of the intelligence that Bricy and the plantations between that place and Janvry were occupied by the enemy, the three Batteries of the 4th Brigade were sent to a position on the east of Huetre, whence they opened fire. At this time, 9 A.M., two batteries of Horse Artillery belonging to the 4th Cav. Div. were in action on the west of Huetre. At Patay, a brisk engagement had commenced soon after 8 A.M. The Advance Guard (two comps. 3rd Regt. and one squadron Lancers) of Maj.-General v. Hontheim's flanking column had arrived, at 8 A.M., in the neighbourhood of Patay, and found that it was occupied, and that its immediate neighbourhood was pre pared for defence. The ist Batn. 3rd Regt. (Capt. Schleich) prepared to attack the west, and the 2nd Batn. the east side of the place, the 3rd Batn. (Major Veith) remaining in reserve ; Stadelmann's 4-pounder Battery threw some incendiary shells into the place, which soon caught fire. The cavalry covered both flanks. Up to 9 A.M., the engagement in Patay increased in intensity, without producing much effect on the enemy, who was superior in numbers, and in a covered position. The main body of the I. Army Corps had been ordered by General v. d. Tann to continue the movement towards Boulay, and had made a slight wheel to the left. The battalions, that formed the first line of the 2nd Brigade at the head of the ist Inf. Div., advanced in the direction of the wood on the west of Janvry. The wood was occupied by a small French detachment, which allowed our skirmishers to come within 100 paces before opening fire, but then retired to Boulay without offering any real resistance."], [299, "Battle of Orleans. 291 When the battalions in first line had reached the southern edge of the wood, the 2nd Brigade halted ; the 2nd and 3rd Batns. 2nd Regt. occupied the edge and Janvry ; the 9th Batn. Rifles, on the left flank, was placed partly in Janvry and partly on the ridges which rise on the east of that village. The enemy occupied a lunette, on the north-east of Boulay, flanked by rifle-pits on both sides, with some infantry and about eight guns, which kept up a brisk fire upon the position of the 2nd Brigade. Prince Leopold's 6-pounder Battery opened fire between Janvry and the wood upon the enemy's entrenchments ; the French artillery responded to the fire with great precision, but our bat tery maintained its position. Captain Reder directed Soldner's 6-pounder Battery to take up a position next to Prince Leopold's, and Grundherr's 4-pounder Battery was drawn up somewhat later on the right wing of the 2nd Brigade, covered by the 4th Batn. Rifles and the ist Batn. 2nd Regt. The enemy responded briskly to the artillery fire, but appeared to become uneasy when some batteries of the 2nd Inf. Div. came into action ; and one of the French batteries retired from the entrenchments east of Boulay, before being endangered by the advancing skirmishers. The 2nd Inf. Div. began its march to Boulay soon after 9 A.M., and advanced so that the right wing of the first line passed close to Bricy. The 7th Batn. Rifles had previously been sent forward to that place, in order to clear it of any remaining detachments of the enemy. The skirmishers of the ioth Regt, having arrived abreast of Bricy, opened fire upon the troops defending the earth-works at Boulay, at first from a considerable distance and, therefore, with out much effect. The three batteries of the 4th Brigade had taken up the follow ing positions: Kriebel's 6-pounder Battery on the left flank of the brigade, in the space between the two plantations; Zohnle's 6-pounder Battery on the east of Bricy, with two guns of Barth's Batteiy ; and the remaining 4 guns of the last-named Battery on the west of Bricy. The 7th Batn. Rifles, having searched the village, advanced in a southerly direction, without awaiting further orders, against an earth-work, which had been thrown up across the high road from U 2"], [300, "The Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. 292 Orleans to Chateaudun, and from which the enemy's artillery shelled the position and the battery at Bricy. The 3rd Brigade was in reserve in a concealed position on the east of Bricy. It was about 10.30 A.M.; the Army Corps was between Bricy and Janvry, fronting towards Boulay, with the 4th and 2nd Brigades in first line, the 3rd and ist Brigades in second line, the Cuirassiers and the Reserve Artillery in third line. A hot fire was kept up by the six batteries and the skirmishers of the first line against the enemy in the entrenchments. The 7th Batn. Rifles was advancing slowly towards the high road. The 17th Inf. Div. had reached Janvry soon after 10 A.M., and touched the left wing of the 2nd Brigade. General v. d. Tann was at the southern edge of Bricy, when a report was sent in from a Cavalry Brigade of the 4th Cav. Div., that strong French columns were advancing from St. Peravy towards Coinces. This movement, if continued in force against the right flank and rear of the I. Corps, would seriously endanger our position, and it was necessary to check it at once. The ist Batn. 13th Regt. was detached from the second line of the 4th Brigade to hold Bricy, of which it occupied the southern and south-western outskirts with 2^ comps., keeping iyi comps. in reserve. The 3rd Brigade was ordered to take up a position fronting towards Coinces in readiness for an attack on the west of Bricy, and the Reserve Artillery was ordered to advance to the right flank. Major Will (Reserve Artillery) hastened to Coinces to reconnoitre a suitable position for his batteries. Prince Albrecht (senior), in command of the 4th Cav. Div., had meanwhile assured General v. d. Tann that his two Cavalry Brigades would suffice to check the enemy's further advance, and Major Will announced that the attitude of the detachments at Coinces was not such as to render an offensive movement probable. During this time (from 10.30 to n A.M.) the attack upon Patay had failed, although General v. d. Tann was unaware of the fact. The 8th Cavalry Brigade, the 3rd Batn. 3rd Regt., which had suffered heavy losses, and Stadelmann's Battery were retreating to Terminiers. If the failure of the attempt upon Patay had been known, more importance would probably have been attached to the"], [301, "Battle of Orleans. 293 concentration of the enemy's forces at Coinces, and the advance upon Ormes might have been stopped for the time being; but it was only so far delayed, that the columns were ordered not to advance until the state of affairs on the right flank should be better known. The artillery and the skirmishers had, however, made extensive preparations for the attack, and the latter, not expecting the enemy's threatening movement, had advanced to within a short distance of the entrenchments. The 7th Batn. Rifles continued to advance on the right wing towards the earth-works on the road ;* the ist Batn. 13th Regt. was sent forward to support the thin line of skirmishers in case of a possible repulse, the 2nd Batn. 13th Regt. now undertaking to hold Bricy. The ist Batn. 13th Regt. took up a position on the right flank of the 7th Batn. Rifles, all the companies gradually advancing into the line of fire. In the centre, two comps. (7th and 9th) ioth Regt. had stolen forward to the farm of Le Coudray, which the enemy had, strange to say, neglected to occupy, and quickly took possession of it. The 5th company followed, and these three companies kept up a rapid fire, from a distance of from 400 to 500 paces, upon the flank and gorge of the earth-work on the east of Boulay, and prevented the enemy from saving all his guns.-f- Two comps. (5th and 6th) 2nd Batn. 2nd Regt. had taken up a good position in a sand-pit, about 500 paces from the entrench ments, and opened an effective fire. General v. d. Tann had decided to continue the movement against Ormes with the main body of the Corps, in spite of the fact that the enemy's columns were still drawn up at Coinces. The 3rd Brigade and the Reserve Artillery were to be left at Bricy. The towers of the Cathedral of Orleans once more rose in the distance, and the houses of Ormes glittered in the sunshine, as they had done two months ago. Our goal was the same as on the nth of October, and neither officers nor men could restrain a feeling of proud satisfaction, when the trenches were once more stormed amid loud cheers, and the enemy was again seen in full flight. Since the battle of Coulmiers, how many thousands had \u2022 These earth-works consisted of a lunette with flanking rifle-pits, and lay west of the point where the road from Le Coudray to Clos Aubry joins the high road. t The artillery fire was equally effective in preventing the enemy from saving all his guns.

Bavarian Army Corps. 294 contributed towards the re-capture of Orleans by the sacrifice of their lives ! The troops were in reality in rear of the enemy, and General v. d. Tann ordered a general attack. This order was partly anticipated by the advanced line, which perceived the enemy's confusion, and threw itself forward upon the trenches. The 7th Batn. Rifles and the ist Batn. 13th Regt. forced their way into the earth-work on the high road to Chateaudun, from which a French battery had been keeping up an active fire upon Bricy and its neighbourhood, which was answered by Barth's Battery. Two guns * were captured, as well as a wagon with bread and biscuit, and a cart filled with boots. t The skirmishers, followed by the columns, advanced almost simultaneously, both at the centre, where the ist Batn. nth Regt. had advanced into the line of fire on the left of the ioth Regt., and on the left flank of the 2nd Brigade, and stormed the entrenchments east of Boulay, where three guns were captured. The attack was made by the 2nd and 3rd Batns. ioth Regt, ist Batn. nth Regt, 2nd and 3rd Batns. 2nd Regt., and 9th Batn. Rifles. The enemy did not await the attack, but fled, partly towards Ormes, and partly towards the neighbouring woods and Bucy-St- Liphard. On account of this hasty retreat, comparatively few prisoners were made ; further pursuit appeared unadvisable, as the enemy was still stationed in rear of the I. Corps, between St. Peravy and Coinces. The 2nd and 4th Brigades were concentrated at Boulay; the ist Brigade had followed ; and when the enemy's retreat at St. Peravy was observed, at 1 p.m., the 3rd Brigade, the Reserve Artillery, and the Cuirassier Brigade also moved towards Boulay. After 1 p.m., the Army Corps continued its march by Les Barres towards Ormes, headed by the ist Inf. Div. The 2nd Brigade was in advance, and pushed forward an advance guard, under the com mand of Colonel Leonrod II., consisting of the 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt., 4th Batn.

At 2 p.m., an order was received from the Grand Duke, stating that the 17th Inf. Div. was moving towards Ormes, and that if it got in front, of the I. Corps the latter should advance by Ingre towards Orleans. The head of the I. Corps left the road, because closed detach ments of the 17th Inf. Div. were seen on it, and took the direction of Ingre. The 4th Batn. Rifles contrived to capture two wagons from a retreating ammunition train. With the exception of a few stragglets, nothing was seen of the enemy ; but the thunder of heavy guns, which resounded on the north of Orleans, showed that on that side the possession of the second line of entrenchments was still being contested. Meanwhile it had grown dusk, and about 5.30 p.m. the troops were ordered to take up the following cantonments : \u2014 The I. Corps between the Loire and the road Chateaudun \u2014 Orleans, with its advance guard in Orleans. The 17th Inf. Div. between the road Chateaudun \u2014 Orleans and the one from Huetre by Janvry and Quartier de la Borde to La Fassiere ; advance guard in Orleans. The 22nd Inf. Div. from the last-named line to the road Chevilly \u2014 Orleans ; advance guard in Orleans. The 2nd and 4th Cav. Divs. were to occupy the villages in which they happened to be, sharing them with the I. Corps and the 22nd Inf. Div. An order was issued, that outposts should be placed in the directions of Beaugency and Chateaudun. The ist Brigade advanced to La Chapelle ; the 2nd into the Faubourg Madeleine, closer to Orleans ; the 3rd to Chaingy ; while the 4th remained in Ormes. The Cuiiassier Brigade moved to Les Barres, Boulay, and Bricy ; the Reserve Artillery to Villeneuve. A detachment of the ist Brigade, consisting of two companies 2nd Batn. Rifles, had been sent during the evening to cross a pontoon-bridge, which was supposed to exist on the west of Orleans, in order to attack, and if possible to take, the French military trains on the left bank of the Loire. This attempt did not succeed, as the enemy had already removed the bridge. General v. d. Tann occupied quarters in La Chapelle. At midnight intelligence was received from the Grand Duke, that"], [304, "296 Tlie Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. Orleans had capitulated, and would be evacuated at 12.30 A.M., and that the town was at once to be occupied. The 2nd Brigade was ordered to leave its quarters and to march to Orleans, which it reached at 1.30 A.M. General v. d. Tann rode with his staff to Orleans at 1 A.M. It may be interesting to give a short account of the movements of the Army encountered by the I. Corps and the 4th Cav. Div. on the 4th of December. On the evening of December 3rd, General d'Aurelles had agreed to General Chanzy's proposal, viz. \"that in the event of a retreat, the latter should fall back upon Beaugency.\" The trains of the 16th and 17th Corps had already received instructions to that effect. These two Corps were disposed as follows, on the morning of December 4th : \u2014 One cavalry brigade (Tuce) and one battalion in Patay, one bat talion and one battery in Lignerolles. Of the 16th Corps, the 1st Inf. Div. in St. Peravy, Mesnil, Chene, and Coinces ; the 2nd Inf. Div. between Coinces, Boulay, and Janvry ; the 3rd Inf. Div. from Boulay to Gidy ; and the Cav. Div. in and around Tournoisis. The 17th Corps stood in Coulmiers, St. Sigismond, Gemigny, Rosieres, Epieds, and Champs. At Patay, where the battle commenced at 8 A.M., the enemy brought three strong battalions, one battery, and one cavalry brigade into action against our troops. The 2nd Inf. Div. (16th Corps) was fighting at Bricy and in the earth-works on the road, and the 3rd Inf. Div. at Boulay. When General Chanzy received the order in the afternoon to retreat to Orleans in lieu of to Beau gency, the above-named divisions of the 16th Corps had been pushed back already as far as Boulay and the entrenchments at Clos Aubry. General Chanzy now wished to attack Bricy, and the 1st Inf. Div. 1 6th Corps was, therefore, concentrated at Coinces, while the 17th Corps was directed to assemble in front of Gemigny and St. Sigismond. Between 1 1 A.M. and noon, four French divisions were ready to attack the I. Corps in flank and in rear, and stood in rear of the Corps, after the trenches had been captured and our front turned towards Orleans. The bold way in which our attack was con tinued, and the capture of the trenches, together with a brilliant charge of the Prussian cavalry upon Tuce's Cavalry Brigade, caused"], [305, "Battle of Orleans. 297 General Chanzy to abandon the intended offensive movement, and to retire towards the south. The 17th Corps marched through the Forest of Montpipeau, while the ist Inf. Div. 16th Corps moved by La Corbilliere to Bucy-St.-Liphard, which it reached at nightfall, about the same time that the I. Corps slowly passed Ingre, Ormes, and Les Barres, on its way to Orleans. The result was dissimilar to anything recorded in military history, and when studied with a map is most curious, for the enemy was retreating as rapidly from our rear as from our front. When in the evening the I. Corps took up confined canton ments along the line Ormes \u2014 Chaingy \u2014 La Chapelle, with its whole attention concentrated upon Orleans, four French divisions were bivouacked in its rear, of which one was at Descures, one at Baccon, and two between Huisseau and Montpipeau. General Chanzy's quarters were in Chateau Huisseau. Some officers of his staff, accompanied by cavalry, made a vain attempt to establish communications with Orleans, but were unable to get beyond Chaingy. Such abnormal tactical situations were only possible owing to the completely disorganized condition of the French army* The French army was numerically strong, but its component parts were held together with difficulty ; their want of cohesion was such, that they could not possibly attempt any offensive movement, after enduring three defeats in addition to the cold and hunger attending their exhausting marches. The losses of the I. Corps on Dec. 2nd were comparatively slight : \u2014 Killed, \u2014 officers, 45 men. Wounded, 9 \u201e 226 \u201e Missing, \u2014 \u201e 30 \u201e 9 officers, 301 men. The 3rd Regt. during its attack on Patay suffered the heaviest loss, namely, 1 officer and 112 men. * We may mention, as one among many similar instances, that about 80 French soldiers bivouacked, with piled arms, in the yard of the house in which General v. d. Tann took up his quarters on entering Orleans. They laid down their arms, when ordered to do so by some staff officers, who with their orderlies wished to put up their horses in the yard, and they were quite content with being allowed to keep their \"sacs \" and to pass the icy cold night near the bivouack fire."], [306, "298 Tlie Operations of the 1. Bavarian Army Corps. The 5th of December was the first day of rest that we had enjoyed for many weeks. As far as the stores would allow, the clothing and boots were made good, and the provisions* (eiserne Bestand) and ammunition replenished. Each division was to be provided with sufficient transport to carry one day's provisions. General v. d. Tann's first care was to procure assistance for the numerous wounded. It had been impossible to remove all of them, and a number of improvised hospitals had been established in half-burnt villages and farms between Orgeres and Orleans, and bore sad witness to the contests of the last four days. The wounded were collected and sent to the hospitals at Tillai, Orgeres, and Orleans. The headquarters of the German Army operating on the Loire were in some uncertainty as to the direction in which the enemy's main forces had retired. It was known that considerable detach ments had retired towards Gien, Beaugency, and Salbris, but their strength and organization had not been ascertained. Field-Marshal Prince Frederick Charles ordered detachments, of sufficient strength to compel the enemy to disclose his forces in case of a collision, to advance in three different directions. The III. Corps advanced towards Gien ; the 6th Cav. Div., with four battalions, towards Salbris ; while the Grand Duke's Army descended the right bank of the Loire, flanked on the opposite bank by the Hessian Divisions The remainder of the IX. Corps as well as the X. Corps were to remain in or near Orleans, until the state of affairs should be more clearly ascertained. The Grand Duke had ordered the movement against Tours to be commenced on Dec. 6th ; the 2nd and 4th Cav. Divs. were to push forward to Beaugency and Chateaudun respectively on Dec. 5th. The advance was to be carried out as follows : \u2014 The right wing, consisting of the 22nd Inf. Div., to march toTournoisis; in the centre. the I. Corps to march to Coulmiers ; and the left wing, consisting of the 17th Inf. Div., to Meung-sur-Loire. The 4th Cav. Div. was in front of the 22nd Inf. Div., and the 2nd Cav. Div. in front of the * \" Eiserne Bestand,\" three days provisions, carried by every German soldier. \u2014 Transl. f The Hessian 25th Div., which belonged to he i-x. Corps, had been placed under the orders of the Grand Duke."], [307, "Battle of Orleans. 299 17th Inf. Div. The Hessian Division had to advance along the left bank of the Loire as far as Lailly. The front would extend from Tournoisis to Meung, a distance of about 18 English miles ; the Hessian Division was separated from the 17th Inf. Div. by the Loire, which at that time was not ford able, and in case of a serious engagement a mutual support could not be reckoned upon. This intended advance, with such an extended front and such comparatively small forces, was apparently based upon the con viction, that the enemy would not offer any serious opposition, and that it was desirable to traverse as large a space of ground as pos sible, in order to discover and annihilate any remaining portions of the defeated army. The necessary orders had been issued to the troops of the I. Corps ; but during the evening a new order arrived, counter manding the advance ordered for Dec. 6th, in order to give the troops another day of rest ; the cavalry only was to advance. The 4th Cav. Div. was to perform the task assigned to it in the general order, which was now cancelled, and to march to Ouzouer le-Marche, with one battalion I. Corps ; the 2nd Cav. Div., on the other hand, reinforced by one battalion, one battery, and one cavalry brigade of the I. Corps, was to occupy Beaugency. One cavalry brigade of this Division was to move through Orleans to the left bank of the Loire, and to advance with two battalions and one battery of the Hessian Division until abreast of Beaugency. The Bavarian Pontoon Train was sent from Orleans to La Chapelle and placed at the disposal of the 17th Inf. Div. On Dec. 6th, the I. Corps remained in its cantonments at Orleans. In executing these orders, the 2nd Batn. 3rd Regt. remained with the 4th Cav. Div., but the other detachments now rejoined their own divisions. The 2nd Cav. Div. was reinforced by the Cuirassier Brigade and by the 3rd Batn. 12th Regt. A general order was issued on December 6th, at midday, by which the advance against Tours was definitely ordered for the following day. The various portions of the Grand Duke's Army were to move in accordance with the following directions : \u2014 The Hessian Division will take up cantonments in Lailly and its neighbourhood ; the Cavalry Brigade (2nd Cav. Div.) will advance as far as Muides."], [308, "The Operations of tlie I. Bavarian Army Corps. 300 The 2nd Cav. Div. will advance from Beaugency to Mer. The 4th Cav.

The I. Corps will march into the rayon Villermain, Cravant, Beaumont, Rondon, Baccon. The 22nd Inf. Div. will take up quarters in the rayon Charson ville, Ouzouer-le-Marche, Villermain, Baccon (but will not occupy the two latter villages). Rauch's* detachment will march from Chateaudun to Moree, push forward to Vendome and reconnoitre towards the west. According to the new order, the front was shorter by 6 miles, the distance between Tournoisis and Charsonville, than it would have been if the order of Dec. 5th had been adhered to. The rayons assigned to the troops appeared to indicate that no serious resistance was expected for the present, and no one antici pated that several of the above places would not be reached with out long and fierce struggles, and some not until after a week had elapsed. The rayon assigned to the I. Corps was almost precisely the same as that in which it, as well as the 22nd Inf. Div., had to fight for the next four days. The following orders were issued : \u2014 2nd Inf. Div. The 3rd Brigade will march at 8 A.M. from Chaingy, by Huisseau and Baccon, into the rayon Villermain, Jouy, Thorigny, Les Blanchets.

By the time these orders were issued, it was no longer possible to execute them without a contest. On Dec. 6th, the 2nd Cav.

ENGAGEMENT OF MEUNG. {December Jlh.) The vicinity of the enemy and the possibility of an approaching engagement induced General v. d. Tann, early in the morning, to order the Officers Commanding Divisions,* to unite their brigades and to march in readiness for action. The Corps was to advance in two columns ; the 1st Inf. Div. by La Chapelle, the 2nd Inf. Div. and the Reserve Artillery by Huisseau. During the two days' halt at Orleans, the Army Corps had replenished its stores of ammunition, and had partly renewed the clothing and equipment, but had received no reinforcements of officers or men. On the contrary, the 2nd Batn. 1st Regt., which was detached on December 3rd to escort prisoners, was followed by the 7th Batn. Rifles and 3rd Batn. 13th Regt. on the same duty, while the 2nd Batn. 3rd Regt. was with the 4th Cav. Div., and the 3rd Batn. 1 2th Regt. with the 2nd Cav.

In the general order,* issued by the headquarters of the Army, no mention was made as to the hour at which the 17th Inf. Div., which was to use that road, should march. All the trains of the 2nd Cav. Div. had been sent along that same road, and finally the 2nd Cav. Div., at the head of the column, was checked in its advance across the broken ground, occupied by the enemy. The I. Corps, being unaware of this delay, continued to advance, and a block was the inevitable result. With a view to restoring order in the confused mass of troops, guns, trains, and ambulances, the ist Inf. Div. was ordered to allow the 17th Inf. Div. to lead the way. The Advance Guard of the latter Division reported the presence of strong detachments of the enemy beyond (on the west of) Meung. At noon, the Grand Duke gave an order, in person, to Maj.-Gen. v.

Bavarian Army Corps. 304 ist Brigade, followed by the 2nd Brigade, continued its advance towards Les Monts and Le Bardon, as quickly as the narrowness and badness of the road would allow. The advance guard reached the southern extremity of the village and halted, in order to give the main body of the brigade time to come up. The ground slopes gradually away from Le Bardon towards the south as far as the farm of La Bourie, whence it again rises towards the west and south-west. It is covered with thickly planted vineyards, which greatly impeded the movements of the troops, without affording them any cover from the enemy's fire. On the other hand, it was more easy to obtain a general view of the battle-field at Le Bardon, as the ground was tolerably even. When the ist Brigade reached Le Bardon, at 3.30. p.m., a strong line of the enemy's skirmishers was visible at the foot of the slope which rises from La Bourie, while several detachments in close order advanced slowly down the slope. On the crest was a battery, which threw shells into Le Bardon. To judge from the continuous firing, the 17th Inf. Div. had en countered determined resistance at Langlochere and Baulle. The enemy's troops, which were opposite the ist Brigade, considerably overlapped the right wing of the 17th Inf. Div., which extended to the north beyond Langlochere. The Grand Duke at once ordered the ist Inf. Div., and in the first instance the ist Brigade, to join in the action. The 2nd Batn. Rifles had hitherto formed the advance guard, and still remained at the head ; it deployed on the right (west) of the road from Le Bardon to Messas, and advanced slowly towards the farm of La Bourie (4 p.m.). The three batteries, that were with the ist Brigade, took up positions south of Le Bardon, as follows : \u2014 Gruithuisen's 4-pounder Battery on the right wing, covered by a squadron 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt.; while Hutten's 6-pounder Battery was on its left, and Schleich's 6-pounder Battery still more to the left, on the east of the above-mentioned road. The 2nd Batn. Rifles had meanwhile opened fire from rising ground favourably situated on the north of La Bourie, and was afterwards reinforced by other parts of the brigade. The ist Batn. Body Guards (two comps.) stood on the right wing of the front line, next to the 2nd Batn. Rifles, and en-"], [313, "Engagement of Meung. 305 deavoured, by a powerful fire, to parry the enemy's attempt to turn our position. One comp. 3rd Batn. Body Guards had pushed forward between the ist Batn. and the 2nd Batn. Rifles, while the 2nd Batn. Body Guards had advanced on the left wing of the latter. The remainder of the 3rd Batn. Body Guards followed in second line, in rear of the right wing, and the ist Batn. ist Regt. in rear of the centre. The Brigade advanced in this formation, the first line forming one continuous line of fire, until abreast of the farm of La Bourie, which it occupied with the left wing (four comps.) 2nd Batn. Rifles, and part (five comps.) of the 2nd Batn. Body Guards (4.30 p.m.). The Batteries and the 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. remained at Le Bardon. The direction of the advance from Le Bardon to La Bourie was almost due south. When the latter point was reached, it became evident that the enemy had taken up a position on the west, in front and on the right flank of our left wing. He had retired fighting before the ist Brigade, and held his present position with strong lines of skirmishers and closed columns, having by this time been reinforced. The order, which was brought at 4 P.M. by one of the Grand Duke's aides-de-camp, \" to advance towards Messas, to assist the 17th Inf. Div.,\" could not be executed, as our own right wing was in considerable danger. Under the above circumstances, it appeared more advisable to continue the offensive movement, and indirectly to support the 17th Inf. Div. by forcing back the French detachments near Grand Chatre. The Officer Commanding the ist Inf. Div. ordered the 2nd Brigade to advance on the left wing of the ist Brigade, while the latter executed a wheel to the right of almost a quarter of a circle, and advanced towards the west instead of towards the south. This was probably the moment at which the right wing of the 17th Inf. Div. observed that the enemy's detachments opposite Langlochere began to give way.* The main body of the ist Brigade advanced in the fresh direc tion, and, as soon as the enemy halted, wasted no time in firing, but rushed forward with loud cheers.

These troops had hardly commenced their advance, and the ist Brigade had not completed its wheel to the right, when a French battery suddenly took up a position on the ridge south of La Bourie, and took the troops advancing towards the west in rear. The left wing of the ist Brigade was completely taken by sur prise by this attack in its rear, and halted for a moment, but after a few shots the battery ceased firing. The two companies, that had advanced against La Bourie, had succeeded in taking it During their advance they had been annoyed by a brisk infantry fire on their left flank, and when they now saw the enemy's artil lery come up and open fire, they rushed upon the battery from the right and left, without firing a shot. The infantry escort took to flight, and the gunners, who did their best to defend themselves, were either cut down or taken prisoner. Eight guns and two mitrailleuses fell into the hands of the two companies. There were not sufficient horses at hand to move the guns into a place of safety, nor were there any supports to keep the captured battery. Ten minutes later a far superior force of French infantry advanced to the attack ; the two companies strove vainly to make a stand, but were obliged to give up the battery, which they had so boldly captured.j During this episode, the main body of the ist Brigade con tinued its advance towards Grand Chatre, driving the enemy in front of it, but was exposed to attacks on the left flank from the direction of Beaumont. \u00a7 It was about 5 P.M. ; the darkness, combined with a thick fog, * Captain v.

The ist Brigade had reached the edge of the plateau, on which the farms of Grand and Petit Chatre are situated, and now fronted towards the west, its right wing standing a few hundred paces from those buildings. In order to strengthen the thin line of fire, which was in some confusion, the ist Batn. ist Regt., which had followed in second line, was now sent forward on the right wing of the 2nd Batn. Rifles. The ist Batn. ist Regt. arrived on the edge of the plateau and saw through the darkness a French battalion, which was in confusion and appeared as if about to surrender, * while the French, on the other hand, thought they could easily overpower the isolated battalion which had advanced with a few subdivisions of the Body Guards ; but after some shouting, the enemy fired a volley and hastily withdrew, f Meanwhile it had become quite dark. The 2nd Brigade joined the left wing of the 1st Brigade at 5 p.m. with three battalions (4th Batn. Rifles, 9th Batn. Rifles, and ist Batn. 1 ith Regt.), but only the 9th Batn. Rifles took part in the fight. The ist Brigade had made a continuous advance, between 3.30 and 5 p.m., from Le Bardon by La Bourie to Grand Chatre, J and had decisively repulsed the enemy ; but the 2nd Inf. Div. found no opportunity of joining in the fight, beyond making a demon stration. General v. d. Tann had gone to Baccon to take command of that portion of his Corps which was not directly employed in supporting the 17th Inf. Div. The 2nd Inf. Div. had been concentrated at Huisseau and had advanced by La Renardiere, its head reaching Baccon at 1 p.m. The artillery fire at Meung had ceased for the moment, but rapid artillery fire was audible in the direction of Ouzouer-le-Marche, towards which the 22nd Inf. Div. was marching. It was possible that the 22nd Inf. Div. had come upon superior forces of the enemy; General v. d. Tann therefore ordered the 2nd Inf.

As the firing was no longer heard at Ouzouer-le-Marche, the 3rd Brigade was ordered to advance to the south upon Villocry (3 P.M.). The advance guard (1st Batn. Rifles, ist Batn. 12th Regt., Neu's 6-pounder Battery, and one squadron 4th Lt. Cav. Regt.) reached the above-mentioned farm at 3 p.m., and opened fire with the Battery upon the enemy's columns, which withdrew in the direction of Cravant. The enemy replied for a short time from two batteries on the west of Chatre. The main body of the 3rd Brigade was drawn up at the farm of Gleneau ; the 4th Brigade and the Reserve Artillery were at Baccon. The 2nd Cav. Div. and the Cuirassier Brigade could not be used on the ground on which the engagement had principally taken place, and were between Baccon and Les Fontaines. The advance guard of the 3rd Brigade had hardly opened fire with its battery, when an order was received from the headquarters of the 2 nd Inf. Div., that the engagement was to be broken off, and the 3rd Brigade to march to Les Banchets. In executing this order, the advance guard had reached Thorigny, when it received the order to return to Villocry. The darkness rendered any further advance infeasible, and the action, in which the 17th Inf. Div. and the ist Inf. Div. were engaged, was drawing to a close.* The enemy had on that day opposed the advance of the Army along the whole line from Ouzouer-le-Marche to Meung.

It was therefore intended to drive the heads of the French columns out of the rayon assigned to the 3rd Brigade, and to re-open direct communications with the 22nd Inf. Div. The Brigade was already marching to Banchets, when at 3.15 p.m. a report was received from the ist Inf.

The following facts may be gathered from the French reports, as to the strength and disposition of the enemy's forces.* General Camo's Division, which belonged to a Corps (19th) in process of formation, and consisted of about 12 battalions and 5 batteries, was drawn up between Baulle and Langlochere. The first energetic advance of the 17th Inf. Div. had been directed against this Division, which soon began to waver ; but when the ist Inf. Div. (General Deplanque) 16th Corps advanced from Le Mee by Messas towards Langlochere, the engagement once more became stationary. The latter Division opposed the advance of our ist Brigade, and, according to the reports,f kept up a rapid fire until nightfall. General Chanzy was not satisfied with only these two Divisions, of which Deplanque's Division had been much weakened during the last few days, and he ordered the ist Inf. Div. (Roquebrune) 17th Corps, which stood between Villevert and Villechaumont, to advance upon Beaumont, \" pour repousser des colonnes qui debouchaient de Beaumont et de Cravant.\" That was giving us more credit than we deserve ; we did not go as far as Beaumont, still less as far as Cravant, and therefore could not debouch from those places. Roquebrune's Division, according to the French account, performed wonders on that day. At first attacked by considerable forces (masses considerables), a musketry engage ment commenced at short ranges, which soon became \" un com bat corps a corps,\" when the second line joined in the struggle. \" L'ennemi,\" he goes on to say, \" dut enfin plier devant l'elan de nos troupes. Le succes fut complet pour nous de ce cote, et il dut abandonner Cravant et Beaumont pour se mettre en retraite sur Baccon, poursuivi par nos colonnes jusqu'au Grand Chatre.\" This very French bulletin is easily disproved ; our ist Brigade extended for 1,500 paces in a long thin line and only advanced in front of Grand Chatre, therefore all that General Roquebrune pursued and defeated, between that place and Beaumont, existed only in his imagination.

A thin white coating lay on the rough and frozen surface of the fields, on which numerous vine yards stood out in dark relief. While the Army Corps was concentrating about Grand Chatre, the report of cannon had been heard in the direction of Viller main. The 22nd Inf.

The abandonment by the enemy of his reduit was the final re sult of this day's battle, a result attained with a fearful loss of life. The principal feature, in the position occupied by the I. Corps, was the ridge of hills running from Launay, by Grand Rilly, north of Beaumont, to Le Mee. These hills slope gently down to the road from Beaugency to Chateaudun, which lies in the valley between the two positions. From the road the ground rises again to the ridge marking the French position, which stretched from Cernay by Villechaumont also towards Le Mee. With regard to the nature of the ground on which the battle was fought, it should be remarked that south of an imaginary line, drawn from Villechaumont through Le Mee to Le Bardon, there is the same dense growth of vines as in the immediate neighbour hood of Orleans ; between this and a similar line from Cravant through Beaumont to a point 2,000 paces to the east of the latter, there are vineyards alternating with arable land ; but south of the road the former predominate. North of the Cravant \u2014 Beaumont line, the arable plain of the Beauce begins. The zone between these two imaginary lines was the scene of the principal part of this day's battle. The Grand Duke intended to assume the offensive with his centre, in conjunction with the attacks of the 17th and 22nd Inf.

They crossed the road, and threatened an attack upon Beaumont; whereupon the ist Batn. 13th Regt. received orders to occupy that place at once. Scarcely had three companies (the ist, 2nd, and 4th) reached the southern outskirts of the village, when a lively exchange of fire began with the advancing enemy, who was now within 500 paces. His advance was at once arrested ; but, considering the straggling character of the village and the nature of the buildings, a single battalion appeared insufficient for a prolonged defence of the place. Accordingly, the 2nd Batn. 3rd Regt. advanced as well, two companies (the 6th and 7th) being sent to the outskirts of the village, and one company (the 8th) kept in reserve.

Div. to follow the retreating enemy and advance as far as the road. About the same time (12.15 P-M.), the 17th Inf. Div. began its movement from Foinard towards Beaugency. In consequence of this move ment, a gap of over 5,000 paces was left between this Division and the left wing of the I. Corps ; this gap had, later in the day, to be filled by the 2nd Cav. Div., although the ground was extremely unfavourable for the action of cavalry. The 22nd Inf. Div. had broken off the engagement at Viller main, and had advanced in the direction of Cravant, until abreast of Montigny, so that this Division was separated by a similar distance of nearly 5,000 paces from the right wing of the I.

Of the 4th Brigade, the 2nd Batn. 13th Regt., the 2nd Batn. and two companies of the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt, advanced, partly through the village, partly skirting it on the north-west; the ist Batn. 13th Regt. continued to occupy Beaumont ; and the ist Batn. and two companies of the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. remained near the village as a reserve to the first line. Of the 3rd Brigade, the ist Batn. Rifles and the ist Batn. 3rd Regt. advanced towards the road, while the 3rd Batn. 3rd Regt. pushed on to Le Mee, forced its way into the place, and established itself firmly there. The enemy's troops, which still retained their hold upon the road, now drew back, up the face of the hill, towards Ville chaumont, and established themselves under cover of the numerous vineyards. The detachments of the 2nd Inf. Div. advanced with remarkable bravery. In spite of a hot artillery and musketry fire, which * The 3rd Batn. 12th Regt., which had been absent since the 6th of December attached to the 2nd Cav.

From that point a few detachments, incited by the example of their officers, pushed on some distance further towards Ville chaumont, drove the enemy out of some of the vineyards, and occupied them themselves. The remaining battalions posted themselves in the ditches running alongside the road, and returned the fire of the enemy's skirmishers. The $y Battalions 2nd Inf. Div., which were in first line, were engaged on a front of nearly 2,000 paces, viz. from Le Mee to a point a little to the south-west of Beaumont. Along the whole line, with the exception of Le Mee, there was not a single point d'appui ; and the unfavourable position of that place, commanded as it was by the neighbouring heights, together with the small number of troops engaged in its defence, rendered it extremely questionable how long it could be held. A brisk infantry fire was kept up on the road, and the enemy's batteries round Ville chaumont literally deluged the space between Beaumont and the road with shells. The 2nd Brigade, which was in reserve with the remainder of the ist Inf. Div., received orders (at 12.30 p.m.) to advance towards Beaumont, so as to be near at hand in case it should be required to take part in the fight. The ist Inf. Div.

The 2nd Brigade marched under a heavy fire of shell in excel lent order, with bands playing, to a position to the north-west of Beaumont, which it reached about 1 p.m. At this moment the battalions of the 2nd Inf. Div., which were on the road, showed decided signs of wavering. They had gradually expended their ammunition, owing to their continuous and rapid file-firing; and when the enemy advanced, as he now did, from the heights near Villechaumont and Villevert, in dense clouds of skirmishers followed by columns, our last detach ments, that remained in close order, were compelled to join the skirmishers. The enemy swept the road with musketry, and his artillery increased its fire to the utmost extent, in order to pre pare for the attack. Some detachments of the 2nd Inf.

It was now about 1.30 P.M. The moment was indeed critical. All depended on our preventing the enemy from effecting his object of breaking through our line at this point. To this end every exertion had to be made. The 2nd Brigade now came into action. Major-Gen. Orff posted his three batteries on his right front, towards the road, where they at once opened fire, escorted by the 4th Batn. Rifles. The 9th Batn. Rifles was directed upon Cravant, with orders to re-establish the communication with the 22nd Inf. Div. The two Batns. nth Regt. were ordered to advance in a due southerly direction towards the road, and later in the day, in execution of this order, they took up a position on either flank of the 4th Batn. Rifles, which was posted on the left of the batteries. Finally, the 2nd Regt. received orders to march to the support of the left wing of the 3rd Brigade, which was most pressed by the enemy, and General v. d. Tann in person instructed the Regi ment to support and relieve those detachments which had been posted to the south of Beaumont, and were now retreating towards that village. The battalions of the 2nd Regt., advancing partly through the village, partly along its outskirts, deployed and pushed on to the road in spite of heavy losses. The battalions which had been left in reserve in and near Beau mont (ist Batn. 13th Regt. and ist Batn. ioth Regt.) were also ordered to the front; in like manner the 12th Regt. and Stadel mann's 4-pounder Battery, which, as we have already mentioned, formed the reserve of the 2nd Inf. Div., received orders to advance to support the left wing, and to fill up the large gap between the 3rd and 4th Brigades. As soon as the wavering and partial retreat of the first line became apparent, General v. d. Tann had ordered the Reserve Artillery into action (1.30 p.m.). This consisted of the following Batteries : \u2014 Bock's 6-pounder Battery, j Under mR Keyl s 6-pounder Battery. J"], [328, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 320 Olivier's 6-pounder Battery. Malaise's 6-pounder Battery. \u2022 Under Major Schleitheim. Mayr's 12-pounder Battery. As soon as the critical nature of the position became apparent, Schleitheim's Division of Artillery moved without delay to a position on the east of Beaumont. The two 6-pounder Batteries opened fire upon the enemy's batteries, and upon the clouds of skirmishers, which were advancing principally from the south-east. Mayr's 12-pounder Battery could not find a suitable position here, and was therefore ordered back, and somewhat later came into action with good effect on our extreme left. The remaining Division of the Reserve Artillery had been ordered to advance to support the right wing, and it now took up a position near the road ; Bock's 6-pounder Battery near Cravant, with Keyl's Battery on its left. Simultaneously with the advance of the 2nd Brigade and of those battalions of the 4th Brigade which were still in the neighbour hood of Beaumont, the batteries, which had been posted on the north of the village, rapidly advanced in conjunction with Kriebel's and Zohnle's 6-pounder Batteries and Barth's 4-pounder Battery, and took up positions south of Beaumont, on either side of the road to Villechaumont. Stadelmann's 4-pounder Battery, which had advanced with the 12th Regt, had already taken up a position next to Olivier's Battery. All these movements were executed under the hottest fire ; for the enemy's artillery was in a capital position between Cernay and Villechaumont, under cover of the crest of the ridge, and fired upon our troops with telling effect Our batteries, on the contrary, were without cover and in the open, and could only tell the posi tions of the enemy's guns by the rising smoke, so that they could neither observe the effect of their shots, nor correct their range. But it was the infantry fire of the enemy, rather than his artillery, accurate as its practice was, that inflicted the heaviest loss on our troops. Every minute increased our loss ; but the first crisis was over, and the road was still in our possession. It may here be as well to give a general sketch of the position held by the I. Corps between 1.30 and 2.30 p.m. On the extreme right, the 9th Batn. Rifles was in communication"], [329, "Battle of Beaugency. \u2014 First Day. 321 with the 22nd Inf. Div. in Cravant. At 1.30 P.M., the 83rd and 94th Regts. of this Division had entered Cravant, and had met some of the enemy's troops entering the village on the south side from Cernay ; these they had driven out without a moment's hesitation, and had occupied the place. The 9th Batn. Rifles had taken up a position to the left {i.e. to the south-east) of the place, and had posted two subdivisions on its southern outskirts, in con nection with the Prussian troops. The line of battle extended along the road from Cravant as far as Le Mee, but we can only approximately give the positions of the several battalions, some of which had been reduced to little more than the strength of a company. At the moment of the crisis already mentioned, i.e. about I P.M., the detachments, which had expended their ammunition, had retired ; the battalions of the 2nd Brigade had meanwhile come up, and advanced into the intervals thus left, and become mixed with troops of the 2nd Inf. Div, some of which were advancing as supports, others returning to their places with fresh supplies of ammunition. The following is as nearly as possible the order from right to left of the several detachments in the line : \u2014 ist and 2nd Batns. nth Regt., 4th Batn. Rifles, ist, 2nd, and 3rd Batns. ioth Regt, ist, 2nd, and 3rd Batns. 2nd Regt. mixed with those of the 13th Regt, ist, 2nd, and 3rd Batns. 12th Regt, ist Batn. Rifles, ist Batn. 3rd Regt., and on the extreme left in Le Mee the 3rd Batn. 3rd Regt. In rear of this line, which was actively engaged along its whole front, stood the batteries, exposed without any cover to the artil lery and musketry fire. On the right wing, resting upon Cravant, stood Will's Division of Artillery, with Bock's and Keyl's 6-pounder Batteries ; to the left of these, Reder's Division, with Prince Leopold's and Soldner's 6-pounder Batteries and Grundherr's 4-pounder Battery ; to the south of Beaumont, on either side of the road to Villechaumont, Zbhnle's and Kriebel's 6-pounder Batteries and Barth's 4-pounder Battery. Further to the left, Stadelmann's 4-pounder Battery, Schleitheim's Division with Olivier's and Malaise's 6-pounder Bat teries, then Neu's 6-pounder Battery; and on the extreme left, opposite Le Mee, Carl's 6-pounder Battery. It is chiefly due to the courage and devotion of the artillery, that three brigades of infantry were not only able to hold the posi- Y"], [330, "The Operations of the I.

These Brigades were very weak at the outset, and were still further reduced by their losses in this action to a strength of at most 5,000 bayonets. Our only reserves consisted of the ist Brigade, 2,000 strong, on the north of Beaumont, and the Cuirassiers near Grand Chatre. The situation could in no respect be deemed favourable. The enemy, on a height commanding our position, had a great supe riority of infantry, and at least an equal force of artillery ; his fire-arms were better than ours, and he could at any moment attempt a fresh attack on our attenuated line, which merely con sisted of one chain of skirmishers. Should he succeed in breaking through this line at any point, our deficiency in reserves and the absence of strong natural points d'appui rendered a retreat inevit able. The position of affairs in the centre was rendered still more difficult by the fact that the Prussian Divisions, in their advance on either wing of the I. Corps, came upon superior forces of the enemy. The 22nd Inf. Div., with which we at least kept up com munications, had great difficulty in maintaining its position between Jouy and Cravant against the well-nigh overwhelming attack of the enemy ; while the 17th Inf. Div. was at this moment preparing an attack against the troops, that had established themselves on the vine-clad hills between Beaugency and Messas. Of the latter place the enemy was still in undisputed possession; there was consequently a considerable gap between it and Le Mee, which he either did not notice, or did not know how to make use of. The Grand Duke at once perceived the importance of this opening into the German position, and, having already despatched the 2nd Cav. Div. to this flank, now ordered the Brigade of Cuirassiers to the same place. Unfortunately, the vineyards proved impracticable for cavalry, and a great obstruction to the use of artillery. The Grand Duke had no more infantry at his disposal ; for at 2.30 p.m. the ist Brigade, the last of the reserves, had been sent to reinforce the front, and to execute an offensive movement against the heights near Villechaumont. Of that Brigade, the 2nd Batn. Body Guards advanced on the west, the 3rd Batn. Body Guards and the 2nd Batn. Rifles on the east of Beaumont. The ist Batn. Body Guards passed through"], [331, "Battle of Beaugency. \u2014 First Day. 323 the village itself, and the ist Batn. ist Regt. remained for the present in reserve on the east of Beaumont ; the whole reserve of the Corps consisted of two companies. The 3rd Batn. Body Guards and the 2nd Batn. Rifles took up their position on the left wing of the first line, among the detach ments of the 3rd Brigade. A company and a half (the 4th and half the 3rd) of the last-mentioned Battalion were sent to strengthen the force holding Le Mee, the ammunition of which was already beginning to fail. The two remaining Batns. Body Guards filled up the gap, more towards the centre of the first line, between the 2nd and 12th Regts. Shortly before this, Mayr's 12-pounder Battery, the last that still remained in reserve, had taken up a position on the extreme left, next to Carl's 6-pounder Battery, where it contributed greatly to secure this, the most exposed flank. While the above movements were being carried out (about 3 p.m.), strong detachments of the enemy had advanced from Cernay towards Cravant, and were now threatening our right flank, at a distance of only 600 paces from the road. Our infantry, posted in the ditches running along the road, could with difficulty maintain its position, and our batteries (Will's and Reder's Divi sions and Grundherr's Battery) were completely deluged by the enemy's bullets. The losses of the artillery in men and horses were rapidly growing serious ;* should the enemy continue his attack and succeed in breaking through our line, we could scarcely hope to save the guns. The Batteries were therefore ordered to limber up, under the scathing fire of the enemy,-f and take up a fresh position, 800 yards to the rear, on the west of Beaumont. The rapid fire of our infantry at length compelled the enemy to halt, and he began slowly to retire towards Villechaumont. His retreat was probably accelerated by the failure of his \u00bb The guns had gone into action with four horses a-piece ; the greater number of them had now only two, and many had lost their whole team, so that the remaining horses had to be distributed among the guns, under the enemy's fire. t During this operation, two guns of Keyl's Battery, under ist Lieut. Lamezan, covered the retreat of the remaining four. Of this subdivision, only one gun with two horses could be retired ; all the horses of the other had been killed, and a fresh team sent to remove it was shot down before it could reach the gun. ist Lieut. Lamezan, lying on the ground with his foot crushed, ordered the only three remaining gunners to take out the cylindrical wedge so as to render the gun useless At this critical moment, the enemy's skirmishers being at a distance of only 500 paces, the Officer Commanding the Battery hurried up with the spare limber of another battery, and placed the gun in safety. Y 2"], [332, "The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. 324 attempt against Cravant, which the 93rd and 94th Prussian Regi ments, in conjunction with the 9th Batn. Rifles, had completely repulsed. During this time the fire along the whole line continued with unremitting violence. The artillery especially was exposed with out the slightest cover to the fire of the enemy's infantry ; its tenacious endurance afforded a tactical, and, what was of more importance, a moral support to our lines of infantry, which were being rapidly thinned by their heavy losses, and were without any reserves in close formation. The retreat of the enemy, opposite our right wing, gave us an opportunity of assuming the offensive at this point, our object being the capture of the commanding heights near Villechaumont The three Batteries of the 2nd Brigade and Will's Division of the Reserve Artillery resumed their positions near the road, while on our right flank the ist Batn. nth Regt. began the attack. The movement was taken up in succession from right to left by all the detachments that had been hitherto on the road, in front of it, or among the vineyards ; they advanced up the slope, driving the enemy before them with loud cheers. This offensive stroke must by no means be looked upon as an advance forming part of a tactical scheme. The various brigades and regiments forming our line of fire, intermingled as they were with each other, were only kept in hand to a certain extent by the efforts of the few unwounded officers, who, as soon as the offensive movement became apparent, rushed to the front and led their several detachments forward in the order in which they stood. Hence it happened that the attack, the direction of which was only determined by the impetuous desire of the troops to advance, was involuntarily concentrated upon the chief object, Villechau mont, and that the line further to our left, towards Le Mee, was weakened to a considerable extent. At 3.30 p.m., the enemy's position was at length gained, though not without heavy loss. The several detachments of the 2nd, nth, ioth, and 13th Regts., and to their left a mixed body of the 12th and 3rd Regts., the Regt. of Body Guards, and the ist Batn. Rifles, pushed on into Villechaumont, directing a rapid fire upon the enemy, who was now in retreat upon Villevert, and taking a number of prisoners. Our attack was, however, soon checked ; in addition to the"], [333, "Battle of Beaugency. \u2014 First Day. 325 numerical superiority of the enemy, he had still solid bodies of reserves, which received our troops as they arrived, breathless and exhausted, with a rapid succession of volleys. Under cover of these detachments, his routed troops rallied in a hollow running from Villevert towards Le Mee, and, finding that they were no longer pursued, halted and once more began to advance. In rear of our most advanced line, which reached from Ville chaumont to Le Mee, we had not a single body in close formation on the entire field of battle ; only one detachment of the 1. Corps (ist Batn. ist Regt)* remained intact, and even this had been exposed for some time to the enemy's shells. The enemy, evidently reinforced, continued his advance, prin cipally against our left wing, this movement being supported by two batteries, which had . taken up a position on the east of Villorceau. Our battalions, or rather the remains of them, gathered round their colours and made the best stand they could, the officers as usual showing a brilliant example. The exceptionally heavy fire of the enemy caused us enormous losses in a very short space of time, while our ammunition again began to fail. Officers and men alike felt that their present position, in the total absence of any kind of reserve, was absolutely untenable, unless fresh supplies of ammunition could be at once procured. Before this could be done, some of our detachments gave way before the pressure of the enemy, and at last a general retreat began towards the road, in which our troops, exposed to the rapid fire of the enemy's infantry, sustained still further losses. The battalions which had forced their way into Villechaumont (viz. ist Batn. 2nd Regt, 2nd Batn. ioth, and ist and 2nd Batns. 13th Regt.)f endeavoured to maintain themselves there ; but at length, when the enemy began to advance in superior foree from Villevert, they too were compelled to retreat to the road, finding themselves completely isolated by the retreat of the left wing, and exposed to a fire of shells, not only from the enemy's batteries, but from some of our own, owing to the belief that our troops had completely evacuated Villechaumont. Nevertheless, some por tions of the nth Regt. remained in a position about 1,000 paces to the south of the road till the end of the battle. It was now about 4.30 p.m. Those detachments of the left wing, the ammunition of which had failed, had continued their retreat up * Two companies onlv. + The four Batns. had only a strength of 1,000 men."], [334, "326 The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. to the heights on which the artillery was in position, and, by so doing, had seriously endangered the safety of our batteries to the south-east of Beaumont (Olivier's, Malaise's, Stadelmann's, and Kriebel's). The ammunition of the batteries themselves had partially failed, and some of the guns, having fired their last shell upon the enemy's skirmishers, were obliged to retire. Le Mee had been occupied, very advantageously for us, by the 3rd Batn. 3rd Regt., and iy comps. 2nd Batn. Rifles from noon up to this time ; but the enemy, now forcing his way into the village on three sides, compelled our troops to evacuate it, and unfortunately succeeded in making a number of prisoners. The capture of Le Mee rendered the positions of Carl's and Neu's batteries no longer tenable, so that the Cuirassier Brigade alone remained to cover this flank, on ground where the numerous vineyards rendered the effective action of cavalry extremely improbable. It was now getting dark. The enemy seemed to have discovered the dangerous gap between Messas and Le Mee. Suddenly the enemy's infantry fire ceased, and in its place the usual French signal for the end of a battle began, viz. a feu d'enfer from every battery in position. Meanwhile, owing to the indefatigable activity of the few officers that still remained effective, our detachments had again advanced to the road, where for the second time they firmly established themselves, and were now definitely in possession of it. While this was going on, the 17th Inf. Div. had succeeded in taking Messas, after a severe struggle, and thus compelling the enemy, who was threatening our left flank, to retire.* At 5.30 p.m., just as complete darkness was coming on, the sounds of battle died away. In spite of heavy sacrifices and two serious repulses, the 1. Corps had succeeded in maintaining possession of the field of battle; but it was further necessary, at any cost, to occupy both Villechaumont and Le Mee as proofs of victory. * The 17th Inf. Div., which only mustered 5,000 bayonets, had, as already mentioned, received the order to advance from Foinard at 12.15 P-M. It was obliged to engage superior numbers of the enemy, posted in a strong position, and met with an obstinate resistance, especially in Messas. Under these circumstances, it had not found it possible until nightfall to clear our left wing. On the 8th of December, this Division lost 11 officers and j46 men."], [335, "Battle of Beaugency. \u2014 First Day. 327 The 4th Brigade, diminished as it was in numbers, was ordered to take Villechaumont, the 3rd Brigade to take Le Mee. But before these orders were even issued, the Officer Command ing the 4th Brigade (Col. Ysenburg) had determined to occupy Villechaumont, and had sent a reconnoitring patrol of the 13th Regt. into the village. It reported it free from the enemy, where upon the three Batns. ioth Regt. marched in and made dispositions for defence of the village, and of a windmill to the west of it. A detachment, under ist Lieut. Lichtenstein, 4th Lt. Cav. Regt, consisting of the ist Batn. Rifles, the 12th Regt, and one squadron 4th Lt. Cav. Regt., had advanced to Le Mee, and occupied it without resistance, the enemy having already with drawn towards Villevert and Vernon. In order to secure the important position of Villechaumont, the only two guns of Barth's 4-pounder Battery that still remained fit for service, and two squadrons of the 4th Lt. Cavalry Regt. were sent into the place. The scattered detachments were collected in the neighbourhood of Beaumont, but did not march till very late * into their canton ments, if we may so call the wretched hovels, half destroyed as they were, and crowded with hundreds of wounded. The artillery and a large portion of the cavalry had to bivouack in the open during a bitterly cold night. Of food they had next to nothing, for their haversacks were nearly empty, and the provision wagons, which were further to the rear, failed to find their respective detachments in the darkness. The I. Corps was disposed as follows for the night : \u2014 The ist Brigade in Le Bardon and Le Duisson ; the 2nd Bri gade fin Grand Rilly and Petit Rilly ; the 3rd Brigade occupied Le Mee and Beaumont ; the 4th Brigade had the ioth Regt. in Villechaumont, the 13th in Beaumont. The Cuirassier Brigade was cantoned in Huisseau, Voisinas, Presort, and Challerie. The Reserve Artillery in Thorigny, Launay, La Borde. From Villechaumont, outposts were sent out towards Cernay and Villevert, which latter place was still occupied by the enemy. The detachment in Le Mee established communications with the 17th Inf.

Tann's quarters were, as before, in Chateau La Touane. The troops were quite exhausted ; the effect of the excessive and unceasing exertions and privations of the last four weeks now made itself severely felt. Many of our soldiers were left lying in various houses and farms, their physical strength completely worn out. Not only the men, but the materiel of horses and guns had suffered considerably, and it was impossible to do more than par tially to supply their deficiencies. Several of the 4-pounders were so leaded as to render them completely useless. There was also a deficiency of artillery ammunition, of which we had expended an extraordinary quantity since the ist of December. Owing to these causes, the 4th Brigade, for instance, could only bring into action, on the morning of the 9th of December, six 6-pounders and two 4-pounders out of its eighteen guns. With regard to the strength of the enemy with whom we had been engaged, it appears from General Chanzy's report, that along the line Cernay \u2014 Villevert, i.e. against our I. Corps, the three Inf. Divs. of the 17th Corps and the ist Inf. Div. of the 1 6th Corps had fought under the special direction of Admiral Jaureguiberry. Apart from certain extravagant assertions,* such as commonly occur in French reports (for instance, that Beaumont had been twice captured), the French account agrees with the actual facts. The attack between 2 and 3 p.m. against our right flank resting upon Cravant, was made by the 2nd Inf. Div. of the 17th Corps, which was so effectually repulsed, that in its retreat it drew with it the 3rd Inf. Div. of the same Corps ; the previous attack, about 1 p.m., which the $y weak battalions of our 2nd Inf. Div. had to withstand, was delivered by the ist Inf. Div. of the 17th Corps, supported by the ist Inf. Div. of the 16th Corps. It was the latter Division that covered the troops of the 17th Corps, near Villevert, and, when driven in by our advance to Villechaumont, advanced to repeat the attack upon Le Mee. The French Commander-in-Chief lavishes the greatest praise on \u2022 \" Tandis que les &laireurs alg^riens, qui avaient couche' au Grd. Chatre\" (v. Chanzy, p. 123).

It may be worth while to quote his actual words, which unintentionally afford a most honourable tribute to our brave soldiers and their leaders : \u2014 \"Nous avions en affaire a des forces tres-considerables, com mandoes par le Prince Charles lui-meme, et appuyees par une artillerie formidable.

The losses of the I.

Div. had suffered especially. The 3rd Brigade, which went into action with 59 officers and 2,466 men (infantry), lost 17 officers and 365 men ; the 4th Brigade, out of a strength of 66 officers and 2,603 men (infantry), lost 32 officers and 418 men.* The Grand Duke, while still on the field of battle, besides making the above-mentioned arrangements for the I. Corps, issued orders (about 6 P.M.) for the disposition of the remainder of his Army. In accordance with these orders, the 22nd Inf. Div. and the 4th Cav. Div. were quartered, the former in Cravant, La Vilesne, and Launay, the latter on the right flank of the infantry, both Divisions finding but scanty accommodation. The 17th Inf. Div. cantoned along the road Beaugency\u2014 Meung, the 2nd Cav. Div. in Messas and the other hamlets between Beaumont and Le Bardon. The following order was also issued : \u2014 To-morrow the enemy will be pursued in the direction of Tours * In the evening, reinforcements (of the Ersatz reserve) arrived for the 2nd Inf. Div. to the number of 1,000 men, and were at once employed as escort to the batteries on the left wing."], [338, "The Operations of the l.

Div. marching by Villorceau, and the 4th Cav. Div. marching from Cravant through Josnes to Seris. The 4th Cav. Div. will have Rauch's detachment attached to it, and will watch the issues of the Marchenoir Forest. The 22nd Inf. Div. will relieve the I. Corps in its cantonments at 7 A.M. At 8 A.M., the I. Corps will receive orders to march into its new cantonments. An additional notice was given, that the concentrations in the morning were not made in anticipation of a battle. Every one believed the enemy to be completely beaten and in full retreat ! During the night a French orderly was taken pri soner * in the neighbourhood of Villechaumont, and an order found on him, according to which the dispositions made for the 8th of December were to remain in force for the next day. This despatch was immediately sent to the Grand Duke's headquarters at Meung. The bulk of the I. Corps was still asleep in its crowded canton ments, or cold bivouacks, when some lively work began at the outposts in the neighbourhood of Villechaumont. The troops in occupation of the village (viz. the three Batns. of the ioth Regt., two squadrons of the 4th Lt. Cav. Regt. with two 4-pounders) were compelled for their own safety to take every possible precaution, and keep themselves constantly prepared for an attack. Villechaumont was, in fact, in the centre of the enemy's front line, stretching from Cernay to that point, and thence through Villevert to Villorceau, and making a bend to the south at Villechaumont, which is half as near again to Cernay and Villevert, as to Cravant, Beaumont, and Le Mee, where our nearest supports lay ; the situation of the detachment, resembling a wedge driven into the enemy's position, was therefore very dangerous. At 3.30 A.M., a Prussian non-commissioned officer brought the news from Cravant, that Cernay had been occupied by the French since midnight, and that movements of their troops had been observed in the neighbourhood of that village. It was evident, from the numerous bivouack fires, and the lines of outposts which the enemy had pushed close up to our vedettes, that he had not retreated. * By the men of the 6th comp, ioth Regt. posted in the windmill."], [339, "Battle of Beaugency. \u2014 First Day. 331 On receipt of the above report, another company of the ioth Regt. (the 7th) was sent to reinforce the 6th company, in the windmill on the west of Villechaumont, and the work of fortifying and barricading the village was completed by moonlight. Soon after 6 A.M., the patrols that had crept to the front reported detachments of the enemy in motion towards us from Villejouan and Villevert ; the whole force occupying Villechau mont was at once alarmed without noise, and at 6.30 A.M. the Officer Commanding the 4th Brigade, Col. Ysenburg, who had passed the night with this portion of his troops, disposed them as follows in and about the village : \u2014 Two companies (5th and 8th) of the 2nd Batn. ioth Regt. occupied the two large court-yards at the south-west entrance ; the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. was ordered to defend the row of houses lying opposite Villevert ; one company of the ist Batn. occupied a vineyard situated on some high ground to the north-west of the place ; the remaining companies took up a position in reserve on the north. The two squadrons (3rd and 4th) of the 4th Lt. Cav. Regt., the action of which in the immediate neighbourhood of Villechau mont was impeded by the vineyards, took up a position near the high road, between it and the village. The Officer Commanding the two 4-pounders reconnoitred the ground at the south-west corner of the village, where he found a suitable position for his guns. Meanwhile, about 6 A.M., the vedettes of the detachment in Le Mee reported to their commanding officer, Lieut.-Col. Lichten stern, that the sound of wheels had been plainly heard in the direction of the enemy. Patrols were sent out towards Villorceau, and soon came upon his skirmishers, established among the vine yards. The detachments in Le Mee were aroused, like the rest, without bugle sound, and took up the following positions : \u2014 On the left flank, the ist Batn. Rifles on a spur running to the south-east, with three companies in first line, and a reserve consisting of one company and the Ersatz reinforcements that had arrived during the night; on their right, the 2nd Batn. 12th Regt., with two companies (5th and 6th) extended, and, as sup ports, the 7th and 8th companies in their rear, close to Le Mee. The ist Batn. 12th Regt. occupied the village, which it had"], [340, "332 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. prepared for defence, and the 3rd Batn., with the 1st squadron of the 4th Lt. Cav. Regt, was in reserve on the east side of it. Soon after 7 A.M., the two 4-pounders in position near Ville chaumont opened fire upon the enemy's columns, which were now visible in the early dawn to the south of Cernay. While the detachments of the enemy in front of Villevert and Villejouan remained for the present inactive, strong bodies of skirmishers had advanced towards Le Mee, and communications between that place and Villechaumont were now interrupted."], [341, "333 CHAPTER XXVI. BATTLE OF BEAUGENCY. \u2014 SECOND DAY. {December gth) The battle of the 9th of December ought properly to be called an improvised engagement, inasmuch as the whole Staff of the Com mander-in-Chief of the Army had assumed, as more or less certain, that the enemy would retreat, and consequently the Grand Duke had laid his plans for a mere pursuit, instead of for a serious battle. The unexpected attacks of the enemy, delivered almost simul taneously against the 22nd Inf. Div., the portions of the I. Corps in Villechaumont and Le Mee, and the position of the 17th Inf. Div. in Vernon,* compelled our Army to accept the challenge thus offered. The Divisions of the I. Corps were separated from each other from the beginning to the end of the battle. It is therefore necessary to give a separate account of their respective operations. The Divisions had each a distinct task to perform, and a dis tinct plan of the enemy to frustrate ; they fought on totally different ground, and one Division had finished its labours for the day before the real work of the other began. The roar of cannon from the heights near Villechaumont, and the rattle of musketry about Le Mee, soon gave the alarm to the rest of the 2nd Inf. Div., which was quartered in Beaumont. This Division was at once ordered under arms, and took up a position on the south and south-east of the village, while Neu's * Vernon had been surprised and taken during the night by a daring attack of the ist and 2nd Batns. 75th Regt."], [342, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 334 and Carl's Batteries of 6-pounders * were posted for the present on the east of Beaumont. In the meantime reports had come in from Villechaumont and Le Mee, at both of which points reinforcements were urgently required. The ist and 2nd Batns. 13th Regt. and Kriebel's 6-pounder Battery were accordingly sent to Villechaumont ; the ist and 3rd Batns. 3rd Regt, with Neu's and Carl's 6-pounder Batteries, to Le Mee. Before these reinforcements arrived, the troops at Le Mee had repulsed an attack of the enemy, which he probably delivered in conjunction with his attempt against Vernon. As they had no artillery as yet at their disposal, they had been excellently supported by some Batteries of the 17th Inf. Div. The fighting at Villechaumont was beginning to be serious when the rest of the 4th Brigade, arrived on the spot. The 2ND Inf. Div. (Major-Gen. v. d. Tann) consisted of the following troops : \u2014 2,rd Brigade (Col. Roth). ist Batn. Rifles (ist Lieut. 3rd Regts f Prielmayer). ist Batn. (Capt. Schleich). 3rd \u201e (Maj. Veith). ist Batn.

The whole strength of the Division, including the reinforcements which had arrived on the previous evening, and which were appor tioned among the different detachments while the battle was going on, was as follows : \u2014 4,400 bayonets, 4 squadrons (370 sabres), and 26 guns. The two Batns. 13th Regt. and Kriebel's Battery of 6-pounders arrived about 8.30 A.M. at Villechaumont. The 2nd Batn. 13th Regt. was pushed forward into the vineyards on the south-east of the village, and at once commenced a lively exchange of fire with the numerous skirmishers of the enemy in front of Villevert, who had till this moment remained quiet. Kriebel's 6-pounder Battery, with the two 4-pounders, under command of 2nd Lieut. Oelhafen, attached, took up a position on the north of Villechaumont and on the west of the road to Beaumont. The fire soon became very warm ; clouds of the enemy's skir mishers advanced from Villejouan and Cernay, as well as from Villevert ; while Villechaumont and its immediate neighbourhood were deluged with shells from three large batteries, posted one on the south of Cernay, the second on the east of Ourcelles, and the third on the north of Villejouan. It appeared probable that in a short time the enemy, supported by his vastly superior artillery, would attack and endeavour to turn the position. The 2nd Batn. 13th Regt. was reinforced by two companies of the ist Batn. which had been kept in reserve on the north of the village, and together they succeeded in checking the advance of the enemy's detachments from Villevert. The enemy's infantry continued to advance in increasing num bers from Villejouan and Cernay, and Col. Ysenburg ordered Kriebel's Battery to be advanced to the crest of the hill, between Villechaumont and the windmill, from which point its fire would be more effective. The Battery accordingly took up the pre- * The other 6-pounder Battery (Zohnle's) was unfit for action."], [344, "The Operations of the i.

The Battery was now exposed on three sides to a furious and well directed fire from some 20 or 24 guns, and, in addition, the enemy's skirmishers, who a short time before had disappeared in a hollow, running from Cernay towards Villejouan, suddenly started up among the vineyards at a distance of 800 paces, and directed a rapid and destructive fire upon the Battery. In a short time it was found absolutely impossible to work the guns, and they were obliged to limber up and abandon their un tenable position ; it was only with great exertions and very slowly that this could be effected.* The situation was very serious. The enemy continued to ad vance, but at length, on his coming fairly within range, the troops in Villechaumont and the windmill, and the Battalions of the 13th Regt. succeeded, by means of a furious fire, in compelling him to halt. In the meantime supports from the 22nd Inf. Div. had arrived at precisely the right moment in Villechaumont. Lieut-Gen. v. Wittich, as well as the Officer Commanding the 2nd Inf. Div., had perceived the importance of defending Ville chaumont, and had been ready from the first to render assistance to the hardly-pressed troops of our weak 4th Brigade. The ist Batn. 32nd Regt. was the first to arrive, and was followed by two battalions of the 95th, with two 6-pounder batteries, under Lt.-Col. Heuduk. One of these Batteries took up a position on the left front of Kriebel's Battery (which had again advanced into the line of fire, this time, however, on the east of Villechaumont), and assisted materially in preventing the threatened envelopment of our left wing ; the more so, inasmuch as Kriebel's Battery could only open fire at first with two 6-pounders and one 4-pounder, the other four guns having to undergo some necessary repairs. Two battalions of the Prussian supports soon pushed on past the windmill so often mentioned, on the west of the village, towards Cernay, while the ist Batn. 32nd Regt. remained near * This Battery had suffered very much on the previous day. On the evening of Dec. 8th it had still, besides the commanding officer, a complement of one officer, four non-commis sioned officers, and twenty-five men. From the position near Villechaumont, the commanding officer returned with only two non-commissioned officers and twelve men."], [345, "Battle of Beaugency. \u2014 Second Day. 337 Villechaumont. The possession of that important point was now assured (10 A.M.) ; and, though the enemy still kept up a very lively fire, especially with his artillery, he made no fresh attempt to advance. After 10 A.M., the 13th Regt. continued, by a series of short offensive strokes, executed with the greatest bravery, to gain ground by degrees in the direction of Villevert. The 3rd Brigade had been fighting an independent action from 7 to 10 A.M., the result of which, if not its actual course, is closely connected with the engagement of the 4th Brigade, and which we will now endeavour to describe. Soon after the above-mentioned attack upon Le Mee had been repulsed with the aid of the 17th Inf. Div., Neu's 6-pounder Battery came into action, taking up its position near the road on the north-west of the village, and opening fire at once upon Villorceau. The enemy now drew back towards the latter place. The 2nd Batn. 12th Regt., supported somewhat later by two companies of the 3rd Batn., followed the enemy to within 800 paces of Villorceau, and began a lively exchange of fire with him, neither side gaining ground. To advance as far as Villorceau was for the present out of the question, on account of the fire of our own artillery ; the space between our skirmishers and the village, as well as the village itself, was exposed to a constant fire of shells from Neu's Battery and the Prussian Batteries on the north of Vernon, their practice being somewhat too accurate to render the position of our detach ments comfortable. At length, during a momentary cessation of their fire, the 2nd Batn. 1 2th Regt., which had shortly before received reinforcements of Ersatz troops, advanced, followed by the 3rd Batn., with loud cheers against Villorceau ; in spite of a furious fire, they took it at the first assault and made about 100 prisoners. This was about 10.30 A.M. While this attack was being made, Neu's 6-pounder Battery took up a position 1,500 paces to the south of the road, and opened fire upon Villemarceau and its park. Carl's 6-pounder Battery, which had only 10 rounds per gun left, remained near the ist and 2nd Batns. 3rd Regt., between Le Mee and Villorceau, in reserve. z"], [346, "338 The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. Soon after n A.M., the ist Batn. 12th Regt. and the ist Batn. Rifles were ordered to advance, the former to follow in rear of the two other battalions of the 12th, the latter to march upon Ville vert, where it arrived at noon and found the place completely evacuated by the enemy. At 11.30 A.M., the enemy made a fresh attack from Villemarceau upon Villorceau, which proved fruitless in face of the heavy fire of the 1 2th Regt., several companies of that Regt. having occupied the churchyard of Villorceau, from which they commanded all the ground to their front. About Villechaumont the infantry fire had ceased since 1 1 A.M. ; Kriebel's Battery alone, which had been rejoined by its remaining guns, and again consisted of six 6-pounders and one 4-pounder, continued to fire upon Villemarceau, Villejouan, and Origny. At noon, the 2nd Inf. Div. was thus in undisputed possession of Villechaumont, Villevert, and Villorceau. The ist Inf. Div. was at this time between Montigny and Layes ; some battalions of the 22nd Inf. Div. had taken Cernay soon after 10 A.M., and the bulk of the Division was now between Cravant and Beaumont, filling up the gap of nearly 5,000 paces between the two Divisions of the I. Corps. We must now turn to the operations of the ist Inf. Div. The Brigades of this Division, the Cuirassiers, and the Reserve Artillery, were still in their respective cantonments and bivouacks, when, at 7 A.M., the sound of infantry fire, quickly followed by the roar of artillery, announced the recommencement of the battle. The whole Division was at once alarmed, and got ready to march ; but no orders had as yet been received from the Commander-in- Chief, beyond those issued on the evening of the 8th of December, according to which the 22nd Inf. Div. should relieve the I. Corps in its cantonments, and fresh quarters should be assigned to that Corps at 8 A.M. on the 9th. The ist Inf. Div.

Div. that had passed the night near Launay, had begun their march towards Beaumont before 7 A.M. While on their march, they had been fired upon by the enemy's artillery, in position on the west of Cravant, near La Vilesne and Montsouris. At 8 A.M., Lieut.-General v. Wittich arrived at Beaumont, and at once, as has been seen, complied with the request of the Officer Commanding the 2nd Inf. Div. by sending supports to the weak Brigade at Villechaumont.

They were marching towards Beaumont, when they received orders from Lieut.-Gerteral v. Wittich to recapture the farms, which the French had in the mean time occupied. At the same time he requested the 2nd Brigade, which had been concentrated at Grand-Rilly since 7.30 A.M., to support the Prussian battalion in this operation. Major-General Orff ordered the Officer Commanding the nth Regt., Col. Schmidt, to advance upon Beauvert and Layes, and take them with the 9th Batn. Rifles, the ist and 2nd Batns. nth Regt, and Grundherr's 4-pounder Battery. This column advanced in the first instance towards Launay, to the south of which Grundherr's Battery took up its position and commenced shelling both farms. On arriving at a point on a level with Beauvert, the 9th Batn. Rifles, facing towards that farm, and throwing out all but two of its subdivisions in a thick chain of skirmishers, advanced upon it, followed by the ist Batn. nth Regt., and took it at the first assault without firing a shot. Part of the defenders, who had kept up their fire till the last moment, were taken prisoner, part took to flight, and were pursued and shot down by the riflemen. At the same time, Layes was taken by the 2nd Batn. nth Regt. Half of that Batn., like the 9th Batn. Rifles, pushed on, about 300 or 400 paces beyond the farm-house, while the other half occupied it. In Beaumont, the ist Batn. nth Regt, which had followed the Rifles, made complete preparations for its defence. Grundherr's Battery now took up a position on a ridge to the north of Layes ; the rest of the Brigade (4th Batn. Rifles, and the 2nd Regt.) was brought up and held for the moment in reserve. The above movements of the 2nd Brigade were completed by about 10 a.m. At 8.45 A.M., almost simultaneously with the arrival of General v. d. Tann at Grand Chatre, the orders of the Grand Duke for the day were received. They had been drawn up at 7 A.M., consequently before the news of the enemy's advance could possibly have reached Meung. The following were the details of these orders, which our altered circumstances had already superseded : \u2014"], [349, "Battle of Beaugettcy. \u2014 Second Day. 341 \"The 17th Inf. Div. will concentrate at Messas and Vernon, in front.\" \" The 22nd Inf. Div. will be formed up in the position near Beaumont, on which village its right flank will rest.\" \" The 1.

Our Reserve Artillery was composed, as on the 8th of December, of the following Batteries : \u2014 Major Will. j B5ck's 6-pounder Battery. I Keyl's 6-pounder Battery. ( Olivier's 6-pounder Battery.

On arriving there, Will's Division was at once transferred to the 22nd Inf. Div., which had had all four of its 4-pounder batteries disabled. Major Will was actually on the march to Beaumont, when the position of affairs on the right flank necessitated a different em ployment of his guns. About 1 1 A.M. the enemy made a more vigorous advance against the 2nd Brigade in Beauvert and Layes, and soon afterwards the two reconnoitring squadrons of the 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. on the right flank reported that the enemy had occupied Villermain and threatened our right flank. The attack on our front required a vigorous resistance, and Major-General v. Orff ordered the 2nd Regt., forming one strong battalion, to advance into the line of fire. Part of this Regt."], [350, "The Operations of the l. Bavarian Army Corps. 342 occupied the ridge which slopes gently down towards Montigny ; the remainder was employed to relieve the 9th Batn. Rifles, which now retired to Layes for fresh supplies of ammunition. Will's two Batteries were directed to the right flank of the 2nd Brigade, as was also the ist Brigade, which had shortly before arrived at Grand Chatre. The 6-pounder batteries of Schleitheim's Division of Reserve Artillery were directed towards Launay, where they could, if necessary, come into action on our right flank. At 1 p.m., when these movements had been carried out, the ist Inf. Div. occupied, as nearly as possible, the following position : \u2014 On the right flank, near Montigny, the ist and 2nd Batn. Body Guards ; in rear the 2nd Batn. Rifles. These battalions had been pushed forward by the 1st Brigade, in order to protect the batteries. The 6-pounder Batteries, commanded respectively by Hutten, Schleich, Malaise, Bock, and Keyl, were in an excellent position, behind the crest of the ridge running from Beauvert to Montigny, from which they completely commanded the open and level ground to their front. On the west of the two points, Beauvert and Layes, the line of the 2nd Brigade was now established ; on the right wing was the 2nd Regt. ; next to it the 4th Batn. Rifles, which had been taken into the first line after the ist Brigade had come up ; then the 2nd Batn. nth Regt., communicating on the left with the 83rd Prussian Regt. Beauvert was occupied by the ist Batn. nth Regt., Layes by two comps. 2nd Batn. nth Regt. and the 9th Batn. Rifles. South of Launay was our second line, consisting of the remainder of the ist Brigade, viz. the 3rd Batn. Body Guards, 1st Batn. ist Regt., Gruithuisen's 4-pounder Battery, the two 6-pounder Batteries of Prince Leopold's Division, and Olivier's 6-pounder Battery of Schleitheim's Division ; Mayr's 12-pounder Battery, belonging to the latter Division, was employed at a different point. In answer to repeated messages, reporting our right flank in danger, the Grand Duke issued strict orders on no account to advance beyond Montigny, and, in case of an attack, to oppose it by throwing back our right en potence. At the same time he called attention to the fact, that the action on our right flank was not the decisive movement of the battle, and that the 17th Inf. Div. would be directed upon the enemy's right flank, while a Division was actually on its march towards us from Orleans."], [351, "Battle of Beaugency. \u2014 Second Day. 343 In accordance with these orders, the ist Inf. Div. remained during the afternoon entirely on the defensive, repulsing the repeated attacks of the enemy by the endurance of our soldiers and the heavy fire of the 2nd Brigade. The repeated attempts of the enemy to turn our right flank were in each case frustrated, from the very commencement, by the effective fire of our artillery. The orders of the Grand Duke not to advance beyond Montigny were very necessary, considering our general position. Although the enemy did not, throughout the battle, display the same firmness as on the previous day, still it must be remembered that our front extended for 9 English miles, from Montigny to Beaugency, and behind our thin first line our only reserve was a detachment under Major-Gen. v. Rauch, which arrived near Grand Chatre during the course of the day. This detachment con sisted of two Batns. 89th Prussian Regt., five squadrons, and two Horse Artillery guns ; it was joined by Mayr's 12-pounder Battery, and the draught of Ersatz reinforcements for the ist Inf. Div., which arrived in the afternoon from Orleans. The Cuirassier Brigade had moved by Chatre and Beaumont to a position on the north-east of Villechaumont ; but the enemy was so strongly posted near that village, that no opportunity was found for making an effective charge. The 22nd Inf. Div. received orders from the Grand Duke to collect as many intact bodies of troops as possible, and form them into a reserve. During the afternoon, the ist Inf.

With the approach of twilight the enemy's resistance grew feebler, and the fire along the whole line gradually ceased. The battle of the 9th of December was no less honourable to the I. Corps * than that of the previous day, although its results were far less bloody. Our battalions, diminished as they were, showed, by their calm firmness and endurance for many hours under the enemy's fire, and by their fearless and vigorous attacks,-f- that their courage and discipline had as yet in no degree suffered from their continuous fatigues, battles, and losses. Their physical powers were, however, well-nigh exhausted. Under fire, and during the active operations of the day, the feeling of military honour, the example of the officers, and a certain unquenchable lust of battle, all contributed to support the weary soldiers. Away from the field of battle, behind the scenes as it were, there were unmis takable signs of such a considerable falling off in physical strength, as must inevitably be followed by a loss of morale. The orders, for the disposition of the troops during the coming night, were issued by the Grand Duke at 4.30 p.m., on the field of battle near Grand Chatre.

BATTLE OF BEAUGENCY. \u2014 THIRD DAY. {December ioth) THE various Brigades and other portions of the I. Corps had just received the order, that the ioth of December should be a day of rest, when the roar of cannon and the rattle of musketry announced the renewal of the battle. At 6 A.M., under cover of the dark ness, the enemy had surprised the troops of the 22nd Inf. Div. in Origny and Villejouan, compelling them to retreat for the moment to the windmill near Villechaumont. About 7 A.M. the enemy's Batteries near Ourcelles and Vilette opened a lively fire upon Cravant and the ground to the north of that place ; dense clouds of skirmishers and columns made their appearance opposite Beauvert and Montigny. The 1st Brigade, which was ordered to occupy Orleans, had already begun its march thither, taking the three Batns. Body Guards, the ist Batn. ist Regt., and the 4th squadron 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt., but leaving the 2nd Batn. Rifles in Launay, to cover the three Batteries,* which seemed, in the present state of affairs, to be in a dangerous position. The 2nd Brigade was concentrated by 7.30 A.M. to the south of Grand Rilly, and, at Lieut.-General v. Wittich's request, was at once ordered to cover the right flank, by taking up the position it had occupied on the previous day near Beauvert and Layes. The draught of Ersatz reinforcements, that had arrived the day before for the infantry of the ist Inf. Div., was attached to the 3rd Brigade. * Of these Batteries, that of Schleich (6-pounders) had been supplied with ammunition from Hutten's 6-pounder Battery, the result being that only two guns of the latter were now ready for action."], [356, "The Operations of the I.

The 2nd Brigade moved at once from Rilly towards Beauvert, and at 8, A.M. had taken up the following position : \u2014 On the left flank, to the south-east of Layes, was the 2nd Batn. nth Regt. in communication with the troops of the 22nd Inf. Div. ; on its right, the 4th Batn. Rifles ; and next, two strong com panies of the 2nd Regt., combined out of two battalions. On the right flank were the two 6-pounder Batteries, Pflaum's and Reder's. Our second line consisted of the following troops : \u2014 The ist Batn. nth Regt. in Beauvert, and to the north of that farm the Ersatz reinforcements for the 2nd Regt. forming one company. The 9th Batn. Rifles, which had been detailed on outpost duty, was concentrated in Layes. To the east of Layes was Grund herr's Battery of 4-pounders ready for action. The Reserve was composed of the Ersatz detachment of reinforcements for the ist Brigade, and was posted on the road Rilly \u2014 Cravant.

Cav. Regt. and Krie bel's 6-pounder Battery. Daffner's Division of Reserve Artillery (viz. Neu's and Carl's 6-pounder Batteries), which had up to this time been attached to the 3rd Brigade, received orders to follow the 4th Brigade, and took up a position between Villechaumont and the windmill. The infantry of the 4th Brigade remained during the whole day without firing a shot, but during the afternoon it had to endure a long-continued fire of shells, which the enemy at Ourcelles directed upon Villechaumont and the batteries on the west of that village. These batteries were able to fire upon Villejouan with visible effect, and, in conjunction with some Prussian batteries established on the west of Villorceau, supported the attack of the 17th Inf. Div. upon Villejouan. In the meantime the 3rd Brigade had moved to a position on the north of Beaumont, where it arrived at 9 A.M. and remained in readiness ; at 10 A.M. the Reserve Artillery arrived at Grand Chatre. During the course of the next few hours, both this artillery and the 3rd Brigade were used on the right wing. About 10.30 A.M. news was brought in that the 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt., which had been reconnoitring towards Villermain, reported strong detachments of the enemy to be concentrating at that place and threatening our right flank. To meet this, the Officer Com manding the 2nd Brigade issued the following orders : \u2014 The 9th Batn. Rifles* which was employed on special escort duty, to march to Montigny, where the 2nd Batn.

Soon after 1 1 A.M., these two Batteries took up a position on the north-east of Montigny, and directed their fire upon Villermain and Chateau Coudray. In front of the 2nd Brigade, the enemy continued to fire with artillery alone, and at so great a distance that several of the detachments of that Brigade were unable to fire a shot. At 10 A.M., General v. d. Tann ordered the 3rd Brigade -f- to move by Rilly to Launay, and eventually to act as support to the 2nd Brigade ; there remained at Beaumont only the 3rd Batn. 12th Regt. Of the 3rd Brigade, the ist Batn. 3rd. Regt (Capt. Schleich) was ordered to occupy Chateau Coudray; it reached the castle soon after 1 p.m., and at once prepared it for defence. The ist Batn. Rifles marched to Montigny, and, finding the village sufficiently occupied, took up a position on the east of it, under cover. Stadelmann's J 4-pounder Battery moved to a position on the north of Beauvert, on the left of Pflaum's Battery and next to it. The three remaining Batns. of the 3rd Brigade (ist and 2nd Batns. 1 2th Regt, and 3rd Batn. 3rd Regt) remained in readiness in a position on the south-west of Launay. General v. d. Tann, wishing to oppose a vigorous resistance to the turning movement of the enemy, had ordered the two 6-pounder Batteries (Olivier's and Malaise's) of Schleitheim's Division to the right flank, where they took up their position on the south-east of Chateau Coudray.

From these respective positions, in conjunction with a Battery of Horse Artillery (Schlotheim's) of the 4th Cav. Div. posted near Les Banchets, they continued to fire till nightfall. By noon, that part of our position which was occupied by the I. Corps was no longer in any danger. Should the enemy attempt to turn it, by sending a column, towards Baccon or Coulmiers, he would be merely exposing it to a disastrous reverse on the arrival of our X. and III. Corps on the following day. The actual battle of the ioth of December was fought in the centre of the enemy's position near Origny and Villejouan by the 17th Inf. Div. The I. Corps took but a slight part in the actual fighting. On the left flank, only the two Batteries, Carl's and Neu's, were engaged, but with good effect ; on the right, between Coudray and Layes, we had also scarcely anything but artillery engaged. During the course of the afternoon, our batteries on this flank were either reinforced or relieved by some batteries of the X. Corps. Opposed to them was the 21st Corps (about 40,000 strong), which however displayed but little zeal for offensive operations. During the afternoon, one Division (the 19th) of the X. Corps had arrived at Grand Chatre with the Corps artillery, so that, for the first time during the three days' fighting, there was a respect able body of intact troops in reserve ; they were not, however, employed. Towards evening the fire ceased along the whole line. General Chanzy, after this last attempt at resistance, to which he had possibly been incited by a visit of Gambetta's to his headquarters at Josnes on the 9th of December, now determined definitely upon a retreat of his Army, which had been so roughly handled. In the afternoon, orders for \u25a0 the distribution of the several detachments of our Army were issued at Cravant, and the following rayons were assigned to them : \u2014 The X. Corps to be cantoned in Beaugency and the villages as far as Meung, with outposts from the Loire to Villemarceau. The 17th Inf. Div. in the rayon Loynes \u2014 Bonvalet \u2014 Vernon \u2014 Villechaumont \u2014 Villejouan, with outposts from Villemarceau by Origny to Cernay."], [360, "The Operations of the I.

When the fire of the enemy began to slacken, the ioth Regt. received orders to move from Villechaumont to Beauvert, to relieve the 2nd Brigade, while the rest of the 4th Brigade moved into very confined cantonments in Launay ; in the evening, one battalion and one squadron of the 3rd Brigade arrived at that village. Three Batns. of this Brigade (ist and 3rd Batns. 3rd Regt, and ist Batn. Rifles) and one squadron furnished outposts in Coudray and Jouy ; the rest of the Brigade was cantoned in Montigny. The 2nd Brigade took up its quarters in Touane and Thorigny. The Cuirassier Brigade, which during the battle had remained in reserve near Chatre, moved into cantonments behind the Mauve in La R6nardiere, Le Pater, Presort, and Rondonneau. The Reserve Artillery, of which two 6-pounder Batteries (those of Olivier and Malaise) had been transferred to the 22nd Inf. Div, was cantoned in Ourcieres, La Chapelle, and La Borde. General v. d. Tann established his quarters in Chateau Voisins, near St. Ay. To the Army of the Grand Duke belongs indisputably the honour of withstanding, during four days' hard fighting, all attacks of an enemy four times its superior in numbers, of forcing him from all his advantageous positions, some of which were obstinately defended, and finally of compelling him to retreat. Although the French had the advantages of superior numbers and a better fire-arm, it cannot be denied that at some points they fought with remarkable bravery and with great devotion. It must at any rate be allowed that the tenacity and endurance with which the enemy's troops made their stand for four days, is a proof of the conspicuous energy and inspiriting activity of their leader, General Chanzy ; especially when we consider the difficulties he had to overcome, arising from the demoralized state of part of his Army and the insufficient number of officers.

Corps was engaged on 8 days out of 10, and lost during that time a third of its men, and more than one-half of its infantry officers. The powers of endurance of our infantry soldiers had been taxed to the very utmost. Since the 8th of November they had been constantly on the march, their strength unrecruited except by a few days of partial rest. At the outset, the rain falling for a whole week together rendered the roads almost impassable ; this was followed by a period of severe cold and cutting winds. During the whole of that time the I. Corps was in immediate contact with the enemy, and conse quently a large portion of the infantry was engaged on severe out post and patrol duties, while the whole force was obliged to be kept more or less in readiness. As we have already mentioned, the I. Corps arrived on the 29th of November, extremely fatigued, in the neighbourhood of Orgeres, and was then in urgent want of a few days' rest. Circumstances, however, prevented the troops from enjoying the required repose, and they found themselves engaged in eight days of fighting. Two evils, which our previous heavy losses rendered unavoidable, were especially felt by the infantry. These were, first, the large number of men from the Ersatz Reserve draughted into the several battalions after undergoing a mere outline of drill ; and, secondly, the deficiency of officers, especially officers of the Line. The 2nd Inf. Div. consisted, on the nth of December, of 3,999 infantry, 1,996 of which were Ersatz soldiers, who had received three months' drill at the outside. Another example is furnished by the 2nd Brigade, which on the same day consisted of 1,912 infantry, of which 1,099 were Ersatz soldiers. These young recruits, although they fought remarkably well, were not yet sufficiently hardened, either physically or morally, to enable them to support the continued strain put upon the troops during the last four weeks, and especially during the December days, as well as the older soldiers did.

These Ersatz recruits were at once exposed to the severest test of a soldier, viz. a winter campaign with hard fighting. The disadvantage of having half our battalions composed of Ersatz soldiers would not have made itself so severely felt, if we had had at least a sufficient number of infantry officers. The number of trained officers had been greatly diminished since the ist of Dec. In sixteen engagements the I. Corps had lost, up till now, 500 infantry officers, and it was impossible at once to fill their places. The system, under which the Landwehr officers were draughted into the line had answered admirably, but the supply was nearly exhausted. Universal liability to service had been so lately introduced into Bavaria, that, under such exceptional circumstances as the present, there was no sufficient reserve of \" Einjahrige Freiwillige,\"-f who would have been suitable for Landwehr officers. Owing to this deficiency of officers, it was found very difficult to maintain the proper amount of steadiness in the long lines of skirmishers, and to this cause must be attributed, partly at any rate, the unusual rapidity with which the ammunition was exhausted. The artillery and cavalry were in much the same condition as the infantry. Both horses and matiriel of the former had been rendered almost unfit for service during the incessant fighting of the last few days. The artillery horses were not only insufficient in number, but were also in such a condition that it was well nigh impossible for them, at least without a few days' rest, to perform their work at all. The 4-pounder guns were so leaded as to be useless for the present, and the 6-pounders were deficient in ammunition. The columns of reserve ammunition had been unable to supply the extraordinary demands. It was, moreover, more difficult to supply the vacancies among the artillery officers, than those among the infantry, as there were no Landwehr artillery officers available. * Literally, crumbling away. \u2014 Transl, j Those who have passed an educational test, and who in time of peace are only forced to serve for one year. \u2014 Transl."], [365, "Battle of Beaugency. \u2014 Third Day. 357 The cavalry of the I. Corps was in a similar plight. Ever since the Corps left its place in the line of investment round Paris (Oct. 6th), both Regiments of the Divisional Cavalry had been incessantly employed on patrol and reconnaissance duties. The Cuirassiers had been engaged in covering the Army on the side of Chateaudun, from the 20th of October to the 9th of November. They had been continually compelled to make long marches, and to detach numerous small bodies of men to great distances, and were also obliged to support the weak Divisional Cavalry. In consequence of these exertions, the horses were so completely exhausted, that many of them were absolutely unfit for service. Daily, during the last few days, from eight to ten horses of the Cuirassier Brigade fell down from exhaustion. The shoeing of the horses was in a very bad state, owing to want of time and leisure. The average strength of the squadrons was only 30-36 files. As the III. Corps did not arrive at Orleans till Dec. nth, the I. Corps did not march to that town on that day, but remained near Grand Rilly, where, at 7 A.M., it took up a position in readi ness for battle. The X. Corps, which had pushed on after the enemy, confirmed the report of his retreat, and consequently the Army of the Grand Duke marched at noon into cantonments. The I. Corps, which was under orders to march on the 12th of December to Orleans, occupied the following quarters : \u2014 2nd Brigade, Chaingy; 3rd Brigade, St. Ay, Voisinas, La Porte; 4th Brigade, on the east of the Mauve, from Huisseau to La Nivelle* Of the Reserve Artillery, Will's Division began its march on that day to Orleans ; Malaise's and Olivier's Batteries were attached to the 22nd Inf. Div. The Cuirassier Brigade was quartered in Rondonneau, Chaingy, and Voisinas. General v. d. Tann's quarters were transferred to Chateau Voi sin, near St. Ay. On the nth of December, the Grand Duke gave orders that * Of the ist Brigade, the ist and 2nd Batns. Body Guards had begun their march to Gien on the nth of December; the 2nd Batn. Rifles and Schleich's Battery of 6-pounders had followed the ist Brigade to Orleans."], [366, "358 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. one Brigade of the I. Corps and the Brigade of Cuirassiers, with one Battery apiece, together with six other Batteries (including those already attached to the 22nd Inf. Div.), should form a 3rd Division of his Army. General v. d. Tann, having regard to the condition of the Corps, which, as already mentioned, was in urgent need of rest, and also to the task assigned to him of guarding the important town of Orleans with its bridges, considered it his duty to represent to the Grand Duke, how unadvisable it would be to detach so con siderable a portion of the Corps, weak as it already was. Three battalions were still absent on prisoners' escort duty, and two had been detached to Gien,* so that there remained, on an average of about 300 men per battalion, some 6,200 infantry for the defence of Orleans. This was assuredly not too large a force, if we consider that at least a Brigade would be necessary to secure the left bank of the Loire. Further, there appeared to be no pressing necessity for detaching portions of the I. Corps, as the III. and X. Corps, besides the IX. Corps operating on the left bank of the Loire, would afford ample support in any emergency to the troops under the command of the Grand Duke, viz. the 17th and 22nd Inf. Divs., and the 4th and 2nd Cav. Divs. Circumstances, however, made it impossible for the Grand Duke to withdraw the orders which he had once issued, but he modified them to the extent that only one Brigade and six Batteries should remain with his Army. For that service the 4th Brigade (Col. Ysenburg) was selected, (consisting of the three Batns. ioth Regt., and the 1st and 2nd Batns. 13th Regt., in all about 1,700 men,) with the following Batteries : Carl's and Neu's 6-pounders, and Gruithuisen's and Grundherr's 4-pounders. Olivier's and Malaise's 6-pounder Bat teries had been already attached to the 22nd Inf. Div. On the 1 2th of December, at noon, the remainder of the I. Corps marched into Orleans for the third time, having left 96 officers and 2,080 men on the battle-fields of Meung and Beaugency. * The 3rd Lt. Cav. Regt. was now on the march to the same place, under command of Col. Leonrod II., who was to assume the command of the whole detachment at Gien."], [367, "359 CHAPTER XXVIII. DECEMBER. The first days after the troops arrived at Orleans were employed principally in the reorganization of the Corps. The troops were distributed in Orleans as follows : \u2014 .1st Brigade,* Faubourg Bourgoigne, with the 2nd Batn. Rifles, and Hutten's 6-pounder Battery ist Inf.

Orleans, covered that side sufficiently; besides, we had received definite intelligence that there were no troops of the enemy in the valley of the Loire as far as Chatillon-sur-Loire. General v. d. Tann had communicated by telegraph with the Bavarian War Office, pointing out the necessity of reinforcing his diminished Corps. An immediate answer was returned to the effect that two service battalions (ist Batn. 4th Regt., and 2nd Batn. 8th Regt.), which were still in garrison in Landau, had been at once ordered to march to Orleans. With a view to procuring the necessary supplies, especially of oats, with greater ease, the system of requisitions was given up, and that of purchase in open market adopted. Commissions were formed for the purchase of horses to supply the deficiencies of the artillery teams. With a view to the execution of the orders to fortify the bridges of Orleans on the south, a commission was appointed, under the presidency of Major-General Orff, to examine the position care fully, and submit proposals. The general result of this thorough reconnaissance was as fol lows : \u2014 The principal defence was to be made by 6 batteries, mounting 40 guns in all, on the right bank of the Loire ; on the left bank, two stockade works, mounting each two guns, were to be thrown up, commanding respectively the railway embankment and the high road to Toulouse. The bridges over the Loire were to be prepared, so that they could be immediately destroyed ; and St. Marceau was to be strengthened on the south by numerous shelter-trenches and rifle-pits. On the 13th of December, the detachment under Col. Leonrod II. arrived at Gien. On the 15th, however, it was compelled to retreat to Ouzouer-sur-Loire, owing to the advance of superior forces* of the enemy from the direction of Briare. On receipt of this report, orders were issued from the head quarters of the 11. Army, that all the troops available for the defence of Orleans should at once be posted on the canal to \u00ab About 6,000 men. The position of this detachment was very precarious, left as it was en I' air. An enterprising enemy, who could soon have discovered its isolated position, would have had no difficulty in cutting it off. . On the other hand it was solely owing to the activity of this little force under Colonel Leonrod II , that the German commanders received timeiy information of the preparations made by the enemy for a movement against Montargis, which at one time was really contemplated by Bourbaki."], [369, "December. 361 oppose the enemy's advance, and that the canal bridges should be destroyed. The 4th Lt. Cav. Regt. was ordered to march on the morning of the 16th to Fay-aux-Loges, to destroy the bridges there, and to watch the roads on the side of Chateauneuf-sur- Loire and Vitry-aux-Loges. At the same time, the ist Brigade was ordered to detach two guns of Hutten's 6-pounder Battery, under escort of half a company of the 2nd Batn. Rifles and the ist squadron of the 4th Lt. Cav. Regt., to reinforce the detach ment under Leonrod at Ouzouer. The rest of the ist Brigade (3rd Batn. Body Guards and ist Batn. 1st Regt.) marched at noon on the 16th to Pont-aux-Moines and Chezy. Further information was received from Colonel Leonrod II., that the enemy had again left Gien and retreated towards Briare. General Bourbaki had for some time been reorganizing his Army in the south, about Nevers. From the advance of the enemy to Gien, it was plain that he might very possibly, now that the bulk of our II. Army was engaged in the pursuit of General Chanzy, endeavour to take Orleans and march to Fontainebleau, in accord ance with the intention so often expressed. As the thoroughly defeated Army of General Chanzy continued its retreat towards Le Mans, Prince Frederick Charles, with a view to the contingency just mentioned, entrusted the further pursuit to the X. Corps, the ist Cav. Div., and the Army of the Grand Duke. The III. and IX. Corps, and the 6th Cav. Div. were again con centrated about Orleans, where the heads of the columns of the III. Corps arrived on the evening of the 17th of December. The III. Corps was echelloned from Orleans to Chateauneuf, whereby the unfavourable position of the detachment * in Ouzouer was considerably improved. The 4th Lancers, which had been in observation on the south of Orleans, were relieved by a Brigade of the 6th Cav. Div. At noon on the 22nd of December, the detachment in Ouzouer (the cavalry of which had in the meantime been relieved by the 1 6th Hussars) was ordered to advance on the 24th to Gien. There it was to act as reserve to an attack upon Briare, which General * This detachment was composed as follows :\u2014 ist and 2nd Batns. Body Guards, three squadrons 3rd Lt. Cav.

On the afternoon of the same day, however, an order from H.M. the King of Prussia arrived, according to which the I. Corps was again placed under the immediate orders of the Officer Com manding the III. Army. The Corps was to form a reserve to the Army of Investment, as well as to the II. Army and the Army of the Grand Duke. Orders were issued from the headquarters of the II. Army, that the I. Corps should march from Orleans, so that its headquarters should be on the 24th at Artenay, on the 25th at Angerville, and on the 26th at Etampes. The detachment in Ouzouer was to fulfil the task already assigned to it, and then to rejoin the Corps by Lorris, Beaune La Rolande, and Malesherbes. General v. d. Tann ordered the troops to march by four roads, viz. \u2014 2nd Inf. Div. by St. Lye, Autruy, Etampes. ist Inf. Div. by the high road to Paris. Reserve Artillery by Artenay, Janville, Rouvray, St. Denis, Dommerville, and Authon. Cuirassier Brigade by Sougy, Allaines, Beaudreville, and Dom merville. The 4th Brigade was also ordered to rejoin the Corps, and the Batteries, that had been detached, were respectively ordered, as they rejoined the Corps, to resume their former positions in the tactical distribution of the troops. The troops were to march as in time of peace, an order of march which had been discontinued for a long time. On the evening before we left Orleans, General v. d. Tann received the highest military distinction of Bavaria, the Grand Cross of the Military Order of Max-Joseph. During the march the cold was severe, and the soldiers found but bad quarters, owing to the constant passage of troops during the last few months through the department of La Beauce. On the 26th of December, we arrived in the neighbourhood of Etampes. On the same day, orders were received from the headquarters of the III. Army, according to which the 1. Corps was to be cantoned in the neighbourhood of Arpajon and Montlhery. It was to serve as reserve to the Army of Investment, and, according to circumstances, to be employed on the right or left bank of the Seine. In other"], [371, "December. 363 respects the Corps was to be allowed a certain interval of rest. In accordance with these orders, the several detachments of the I. Corps should be cantoned by the 28th December as follows : \u2014 ist Brigade at Ville du Bois, Villiers-sur-Orge, Longpont. 2nd Brigade at Montlhery, Linas.

The few remaining days' rest were amply sufficient for the complete reorganization of the Corps, and enabled it to look forward with confidence to any fresh task it might have to perform. While the larger portion of the I. Corps had been enjoying an interval of repose, since the 12th of December at least, the detachments, that had been left with the Army of the Grand Duke, had been engaged in a series of laborious operations. On the 1 2th of December, the 4th Brigade marched by very bad roads to Josnes, arrived there exhausted after nightfall, and remained there the following day. On the 14th, the Brigade moved into the rayon St. Leonard, La Courtoisie, Grand Chemin, Le Ramage, La Pagerie ; on the 15th, into the rayon Ecoman, Vievy, Moisy, and the farm-houses along the road to Moree. On the 1 6th, the Brigade received orders to join Rauch's detachment, which was quartered in and about Moree, and thus took part in the engagement that followed."], [372, "3<54 CHAPTER XXIX. ENGAGEMENT OF MOREE. {December \\6th) On the 14th of December, the 17th Inf. Div., followed by the 4th Brigade with four batteries, advanced in three columns to the Loir stream, but met with obstinate resistance at Freteval and Moree. The enemy had occupied the very favourable position afforded by the heights on the right bank with numerous artillery, partly consisting of guns of the heaviest calibre. He not only defended the passage of the stream, but repeatedly assumed the offensive. The enemy appeared to have formed the intention of availing himself of the natural advantages of the ground to check any further pursuit at this point. From his whole demeanour we were led to infer, that he had been relieved and reinforced by fresh troops. During the whole of the 14th of December, the detachments of the 17th Inf. Div. maintained themselves in Freteval ; but early on the morning of the 18th that position was abandoned, as being too much exposed to the enemy's artillery. The bulk of the Division was concentrated on the heights on the east of Freteval in a position from which an attack by the enemy might be vigorously met. Rauch's detachment * having taken Moree on the 14th, and retained possession of it under a tolerably lively fire, remained on the 15th in a position between Moree and La Ruelle ; the 4th Brigade being, as we have already said, between Vievy-le-Raye and Ecoman. \u2022 Consisting of the following troops :\u2014 2nd and 3rd Batns. 83rd Regt., ist Batn. 89th Regt., 17th Dragoons, nth Lancers, a battery of Horse Artillery, and a battery of 6-pounders."], [373, "Engagement of More\"e. 365 This Brigade, under the command of Colonel Ysenburg, con sisted of the following troops : \u2014 ioth Regt.

The whole strength of the infantry of the Brigade was about 1,700 bayonets. The Grand Duke's orders for the 16th of December were as follows : \u2014 \"The 17th Inf. Div. will retain its present positions.\" \" The 22nd Inf. Div. will approach the 17th Inf. Div., and take up its position in rear of it at 8.30 A.M.\" \" The combined Bavarian Brigade, to which one squadron of the 4th Cav. Div. will remain attached, will approach Rauch's detachment at Moree, where it will arrive at 8.30 A.M.\" During the march a request from General Rauch arrived at the headquarters of the Brigade, that Moisy might be occupied, in order to cover a possible retreat through the defile at Ecoman. For this purpose the 2nd Batn. 13th Regt. was selected ; the rest of the Brigade continued its march with the 4-pounder Batteries, and took up a position in readiness in a dip of the ground on the east of La Guiconniere (9 A.M.). Towards noon, patrols of the Lancers reported that strong detachments of the enemy had shown themselves on the southern edge of the Bois de St. Claude. In order to secure his right flank, which was threatened, Col. Ysenburg despatched the 2nd Batn. ioth Regt., with orders to occupy the farm-houses in that direction. The 5th company of that Battalion accordingly moved to Fosse Fee, the 6th to La Mercerie, the 7th to Le Cheneteau, and the 8th into a little copse on the west of La Couteucellerie. Soon after 1 p.m., the Officer Commanding the 4th Brigade"], [374, "366 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. received orders from the Grand Duke to relieve General Rauch's detachment with his Brigade. Col. Ysenburg determined to effect this operation gradually, in order not to arouse the attention of the enemy's artillery on the heights above the left bank. The ist Batn. ioth Regt. was ordered to relieve the Prussian Battalion in La Ruelle ; in order to effect this, and at the same time to avoid the road commanded by the enemy's artillery, the Battalion was to advance towards Moree, along a hollow on the south of the road, and thence gain La Ruelle. Scarcely had the Battalion begun its march, when a lively infantry fire began in the low ground about Moree, and was soon followed by artillery (2 P.M.). The enemy was pressing forward along the Loir stream, and endeavouring to attack Moree on the west and south. In a short time guns and dense clouds of skirmishers made their appearance at La Bliniere, Le Fougeret, and the southern edge of the Forest of St. Claude. The ist Batn. ioth Regt. had been despatched by the Prussian Officer Commanding the outposts in rear of La Ruelle to relieve the Battalion at that place. The two Batns. of the 4th Brigade, that remained available, took up a position along the line La Ruelle \u2014 Le Cheneteau ; the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. with its right w'ng resting on Le Cheneteau, and the ist Batn. 13th Regt. further to the left joining on to the Prussian infantry in La Ruelle. The artillery, being unable to advance across the fields through the thick mud, with their weak and ill-conditioned teams, re mained for the present on the road. At 3 p.m. a lively fire of skirmishers was developed along the whole line. The enemy was soon checked in his advance from La Bliniere and Le Fougeret. A more serious engagement was going on in Moree itself, to which place, in answer to a request for reinforcements, two companies (3rd and 4th) of the ist Batn. 13th Regt., and later a company and a half of the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. had been despatched. With the assistance of these reinforcements, the 89th Prussian Regiment succeeded in effectually repulsing the enemy, who had advanced to within 200 paces. In the meantime, the artillery of the 4th Brigade had come into action."], [375, "Engagement of More'e. 367 Two guns of Grundherr's 4-pounder Battery took up their position on the road to the west of La Guiconniere, and on their left, also on the road, Neu's 6-pounder Battery. Carl's 6-pounder Battery, having found a comparatively dry strip of ground on the north of the road, advanced into a position on the east of the farm l'Autouere. These 14 guns directed their fire upon the enemy's artillery, which was in action near Le Fougeret. Two guns* of Grundherr's 4-pounder Battery, which had advanced nearer to Moree, were now firing upon the enemy's artillery established on the heights above the right bank. After the failure of the attack upon Moree, the attack upon the remaining portion of our position became more feeble ; an attempt made by the skirmishers of the enemy to force their way out of the Forest of St. Claude was repulsed in a short time by the fire of the ioth Regt. In so doing, however, our thin line was still further extended, owing to the necessity of occupying a copse on the east of La Mercerie. About 5 p.m. it began to get dark, and the fire ceased. The enemy's attempt to turn our right flank had been further frustrated by the presence of the ioth Lancers, which remained behind the right wing of the infantry, in spite of the heavy fire. According to the French accounts, the ist Inf. Div. of the 21st Corps, under the command of General Rousseau, had intended to re-take Moree and the adjacent heights (those on the east), but their advance (?) had been stopped, after they had actually taken a portion of Moree, by the order for a general retreat. Our loss in this short engagement was small, viz. :\u2014 Killed, \u2014 I man Wounded, I officer, 7 men 1 officer, 8 men. Late in the evening, the relief of Rauch's detachment was effected, according to the orders already mentioned. The 4th Brigade was distributed as follows : \u2014 * Two guns of this battery proved to be unserviceable at the beginning of the action, and soon after two more were rendered unserviceable owing to injuries to the breech-action."], [376, "368 The Operations of the I.

The artillery took up very confined cantonments and bivouacks at Ecoman. The line of outposts, strengthened by the addition of one squadron of the ioth Lancers, stretched from Moree along the Loir stream by La Ruelle and Le Cheneteau towards Le Plessis. During the following night, movements were heard on the part of the enemy, and the rattle of wheels and departure of trains were audible. General Chanzy's Army was beginning its retreat towards Le Mans. On the following day, the 17th of December, the 4th Brigade was placed under the immediate command of Lieut.-General v. Wittich, and advanced, without meeting with the enemy, by St. Hilaire, where it crossed the Loir stream, into the rayon Busloup \u2014 Gros Chene \u2014 La Haie-aux-Biches \u2014 Les Hauts de Fontaine, and Moree. On the 1 8th of December, the Brigade was recalled to the Loir stream, to Moree, Freteval, and Fontaine, only the 3rd Batn. ioth Regt. remaining at Busloup. The two following days were days of rest for the Brigade. Like that of all the troops of the Grand Duke's Army, the condi tion of the Brigade had been much deteriorated by the laborious exertions which it had undergone. The shoes of the men especially were in a most miserable condition. They had sustained considerable damage during the fighting at the beginning of the month ; owing to the last marches on the deep and soaked clay, in which a boot often stuck, and the continual rain, the small number of shoes that at first remained serviceable were now completely destroyed. The supplies of food had also been very deficient, owing to the country through which the Brigade had marched having been well-nigh exhausted, and it was not till the arrival on the 19th of December of a provision column from Orleans that there was any improvement in the commissariat. The over-great exertions to which the battalions had been exposed had considerably diminished their numerical strength ; on"], [377, "Engagement of More'e. 369 the 20th of December, Major-General v. d.

After a march of three days by Bonneval, Voves, and Boisville, the Brigade rejoined the I. Corps at Etampes on the 26th of December. The Crown Prince welcomed the return of the I. Corps to the III. Army by issuing an Order of the Day, containing the warmest expressions of approval of its conduct. H.M. the King of Prussia, in recognition of the fact that the Army Corps had been during nearly three months in immediate contact with the enemy, and during that time had fought numer ous engagements and sustained exertions such as seldom fall to the lot of any troops, sent to General v. d.

Prince Frederick Charles received instructions to assume the offensive with his Army against General Chanzy, who was advanc ing from the west. In the meantime, Orleans was to be occupied by the Hessian Division only. In consequence of indications of a concentration of French troops in the neighbourhood of Nevers, the destination of which was at present unknown, but the advanced columns of which had come in contact with the detachment of the I. Corps at Gien as early as the 15th of December, orders were issued from the head quarters of the German Army that the II. Prussian Corps, forming part of the line of investment, should be despatched to Montargis, and a portion of the VII. Corps to Auxerre, where, in conjunction with the troops remaining in occupation of Orleans, they were to undertake the duty of covering the siege of Paris on the south and south-east. The I. Corps was directed to relieve the II. Prussian Corps ; an order to this effect arrived from Versailles at 1 A.M. on the 2nd of January at the headquarters of the Corps. The distance between the cantonments of the Corps and the district to be occupied between the Seine and Marne was very considerable ; the military bridges at Juvisy and Villeneuve St. Georges had been injured by the ice, and had therefore been partly removed. The only available point of passage was at Corbeil, where supplies of ammunition and provisions were constantly passing."], [379, "In tlie Line of Investment. 371 It was therefore considered necessary to move at least part of the Army Corps on the 2nd of Jan., so that the whole might be able to march into its new position before sunset on the 3rd. On the 2nd of Jan. the 2nd Inf. Div. was echelloned on the right bank of the Seine, between Corbeil and Draveil. On the 3rd of Jan. the I. Corps marched into its new positions ; the two Inf. Divs. moving by the road along the Seine, and the Reserve Artillery by the road from Melun to Paris. The Cuiras sier Brigade, which was furthest in rear, and the Division of Engineers, reached Corbeil. The portion of the line of investment to be occupied by the I. Corps, reached from the junction of the Morbras and the Marne, across the spits of land that run out to the north-east between the Marne and the Seine, to Choisy-le-Roi * on the Seine. The troops were at first distributed in a similar manner to those of the II. Corps, which they had relieved, but later some altera tions were made, owing to the I. Corps being weaker in infantry, but stronger in cavalry and artillery, than the Prussian Corps that had occupied the same district. The I. Corps extended from Ormesson to Choisy-le-Roi, along a front of 5 English miles, or 10,000 paces. For the defence of this position, 27 y batns. were available, comprising 15,680 bayonets,f 14 squadrons j\" (1,862 sabres), and 102 guns, in all 17,542 men, or an average of less than 2 men per pace along the line of defence. This is a fresh proof, in addition to the many already afforded by this war, that the principles of theory cannot always be adhered to in practice. At Chennevieres, on the right (north) the I. Corps touched the Wiirtemberg Division, the line of defence of which stretched by Champigny and Brie-sur-Marne to Noisy. On the left (west) of the I. Corps, the VI. Corps remained in the position on the left bank of the Seine from Choisy-le-Roi to Sceaux, which it had occupied since the beginning of the investment, and was touched at Sceaux by the II. Bavarian Corps. Although the front was, as we have mentioned, disproportionately \u00bb On many maps Choisy-sur-Seine. + The 2nd Batn. 4th Regt. and the 2nd Batn. 8th Regt. had arrived as reinforcements, and many slightly wounded men, stragglers, and sick, had returned to the ranks. On the other hand, one company was detached to Rambouillet, two to the line of railway between Etampes and Orleans, one battalion to Corbeil. t Two squadrons were detached to Etampes and Arpajon. B B 2"], [380, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 372 extended, on the other hand the nature of the ground rendered the position most advantageous for defence. The entrenchments, that the Bavarians had found and had still further strengthened, enabled them to count upon making a suc cessful resistance to any sortie of the enemy. A sharply-defined line of hills runs in fact from the Marne towards the Seine, forms a natural termination to the spits of land occupied by the I. Corps, and marked the principal line of defence. Along that line lie the hamlets of Sucy, Le Piple Chateau, Boissy St. Leger, Brevannes, Limeil avec Valenton, and Villeneuve St. Georges ; all forming strong points of defence and of mutual support. The defence of the line of investment was now confided to the 2nd Inf. Div., reinforced by three batteries of Reserve Artillery. One brigade and one battery was on standing outpost duty, while the remainder of the Division was quartered in the villages along the line of defence. Behind the first line, the other detachments of the Corps occu pied extremely confined cantonments, in such a manner that the troops were prepared, according to circumstances, either to advance into the front line, or to support the troops of the line of investment on the flank of the I. Corps. The ist Inf. Div. occupied the villages on the Yeres and Reveillon, as far as Brunoy and Villecresnes, while the Reserve Artillery (three batteries) was stationed along the high road from Brie-Comte-Robert to Paris, and extended from Marolles as far as Servon. The Cuirassier Brigade, which would not be required at the com mencement of an engagement, was cantoned still further to the rear in Grisy and Coubert. The company of Field Engineers, with its three pontoons, was sent to Draveil with a view to making a bridge at Juvisy. Of the II. Prussian Corps, the 3rd Inf. Div. and the Reserve Artillery had marched to the south on January 2nd. At the same hour on the 3rd of Jan., as the 4th Inf. Div., which stood in first line, moved from its rendezvous at Boissy St. Leger, the 3rd Brigade of the I. Corps formed up behind Limeil, in order to com plete the reliefs. As soon as this was accomplished, the supports followed the main body, while the extreme outposts, consisting of two bat alions,"], [381, "In the Line of Investment. 373 remained stationary during the following night, in order to enable the Bavarian outposts to become acquainted with the ground, so that there might be no confusion as to their whereabouts in case of a night attack. The line of outposts, the videttes of which were only a few hundred paces from those of the enemy, began on the right wing where the Morbras runs into the Marne, extended along the latter river to Mont Mesly, thence to the north, by the villages of Mesly and Carrefour Pompadour, past La Folie farm, as far as the banks of the Seine. Mont Mesly was the most important point in the rayon of out posts ; while it commanded the neighbouring ground, it also advanced far beyond the line of defence of the nearest Corps (VI. Corps and Wurtemburg Division). It was within range of several forts and entrenchments of the enemy, and could not there fore be continuously occupied. In case of a sudden attack, it would be necessary to hold it by bringing up reserves as quickly as possible. With this object, supports were held in readiness in the villages of Mesly and Bonneuil, consisting of four battalions and a battery. Behind the left wing of the outposts, two battalions were stationed as supports in the farm de l'Hopital, which had been prepared for defence. Similar points of the advanced line, as well as of the main posi tion, had been fortified and strengthened by the German troops, that had previously occupied them, and formed a line of defence of great strength, and rendered stronger by their commanding positions which enabled the artillery to be used with great effect. The cantonments were very much confined ; the villages, half destroyed, and deserted by all their inhabitants, only offered the most miserable accommodation ; and their completely neglected condition rendered them far from healthy. Our attention was chiefly concentrated on the enemy, who might make a last desperate attempt at any hour of the day or night ; our next great anxiety being to strengthen the line of defence, without attempting to render the cantonments more habitable. The enemy in general remained inactive ; the occasional shells and bullets caused no losses. A patrol, consisting of an officer and three men, lost its way at night in the unexplored country, and was taken prisoner. The headquarters of the VI. Corps had agreed to the proposal,"], [382, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 374 that in case of an attack the ist Brigade I. Corps should cross the Seine as a support. It was very important that the communication across the river should not be suddenly interrupted, as it might perhaps be at a most critical moment ; and as with the return of milder weather the bridges of ice at Villeneuve St. Georges and Juvisy would no longer be available, the Division of engineers was ordered on January 9th to construct rafts at Ablon and Athis, where the river was free from ice. At Ablon, on the 12th of January, the ferry was replaced by a bridge, 520 feet long, made with Birago trestles and such material as was available. The continuous thick mist enabled the enemy to assemble considerable forces unperceived, and called for increased watchfulness on our part. During the few days passed by the Corps in the line of investment, every exertion had been made to strengthen the tract that would have to be defended, and a sortie was awaited with confidence. The distance between the most advanced outposts and the principal line of defence, Sucy to Valenton, was about 4,000 paces. It would have taken the enemy at least an hour to force back our outposts over half that distance, and he would then have been obliged to advance over the completely open ground, without any cover, and exposed to the fire of our artillery. Our artillery had received full instructions as to the positions to be occupied ; along the whole line were covered positions for batteries, some of which had been carefully entrenched. The distances were well known and had been marked out. With the approach of the enemy fresh guns could be brought into play ; and when he had crossed the ground commanded by about 1 00 guns, well placed and covered, he would come within range of the infantry, which also occupied prepared positions. When the enemy should be thus shaken by our fire, the cavalry would advance on the left wing on the west of Valenton, where the ground was well adapted for a charge ; the roads to be taken by the columns in the general advance had been carefully marked out. If the enemy should make a sortie against the position between the Marne and the Seine, he could neither attack nor even threaten our flanks, but must make a direct front attack, which under existing circum stances appeared to offer but small chance of success. On the 1 8th of January, when His Majesty the King of Prussia"], [383, "In the Line of Investment. 375 was proclaimed Emperor of Germany at Versailles, the I. Corps was represented by a deputation of officers and men with standards. The 1 8th of January will always be regarded as an important date in the history of the world, and was the crowning result of German unity and German power. On the 1 8th of July, exactly six months before, the ruler of France had declared war against Germany; and that measure, which was only adopted as a last expedient to revive the sinking fortunes of she dynasty, aroused the greater part of the French nation to as great a pitch of enthusiasm as if the fetters of slavery were at last to be broken, instead of its being merely the last frivolous shake of the dice by the Emperor and his court in the game of the Plebiscite, already half lost. Six months after the intoxi cating dream of victory, the two most serviceable French Armies were taken prisoner, the newly-raised forces were defeated and demoralized, most of the fortresses had fallen, and Paris, the proud city, the head and heart of France, could only resist for a few more days. Six months after the daring challenge, the German Princes and the Deputies of the German people assembled, armed and with their tattered colours, in the state apartments of Louis XIV., \" le grand Monarque,\" who had made the conquest of Germany the leading principle of his long reign, and had left it as a political legacy to his successors. In those halls the marble busts of Louis XIV and his Generals beheld Germany, so long divided and ill-used, once more united and forming a powerful state under a German Emperor. This proclamation of the German Empire before the gates of Paris, and amid the roar of the guns that were bombarding the fated city, was the fullest requital for all that we had endured for so many centuries at the hand of France. The final result might be expected in a few days. The enemy's activity both on the outposts and in the trenches was conspicuous, and his rifle practice excellent. It was especially remarked, that the enemy approached closer to our line of outposts, and had thrown up strong earthworks on the right bank of the Seine. On the evening of the 19th of January the news was received from Paris of the unsuccessful sortie made by the garrison. De-"], [384, "376 The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. tails were wanting, but we were fully prepared for another despe rate attempt to break through our line. The distribution of the Army Corps, with one division in the main position, one brigade of which furnished the outposts, and one division in rear, was simple, but offered several disadvantages. The necessary relief would have brought the division in rear, which was ill-acquainted with the ground and the nature of the service, to the front, into the probable line of battle and on the outposts, and a complete change would have been necessary throughout the cantonments. The position hitherto adopted consisted of three lines in rear of each other, viz., outposts and main line each composed of a brigade, and a reserve of one division ; it had the advantage that a whole division was in readiness to move to a flank, but had the disadvantage that too little importance was attached to the possi bility of a serious engagement in our front. The position of the two brigades, one in rear of the other, with a front covering six English miles, would have rendered it impossible to keep them distinct in case of an attack, and the separate guidance, not only of the brigades, but also of the divisions, would have been lost. These disadvantages could be remedied by placing the divisions one on the flank of the other. This was effected by the reliefs on the 23rd and 24th of January. The ist Brigade remained in the cantonments at Crosnes and Montgeron, the 2nd advanced on the left and relieved the outposts with four of its battalions, while three battalions moved into the can tonments of the main line. The 3rd Brigade furnished the outposts on the right of those of the 2nd, while the 4th Brigade, which had been relieved, took over the quarters evacuated by the 2nd Brigade. The advantage of leaving the detachments for a lengthened period in the same positions, which is of great importance in a line of investment, was partially secured by the fact that the cavalry and artillery of the 2nd Inf. Div. were not obliged to take part in the general redistribution of the troops, but remained stationary along the whole front. This was of the greatest advan tage to the artillery, which had been actively engaged in repairino and strengthening the batteries and in marking out distances. The outposts were furnished by two brigades, one from each division, and were placed under the command of a Brigadier, taken from the second line, each wing being under the subordinate"], [385, "In the Line of Investment. 377 command of a Commanding Officer of a Regiment. The two brigades in first line were under the orders of the Officer Com manding the 2nd Inf. Div., while those which were cantoned at Yeres and Reveillon were under the orders of the Officer Com manding the ist Inf. Div. The Engineers, assisted by the infantry, were employed on the roads, which in some places had been rendered impassable by the thaw, and in strengthening Mont Mesly and repairing a pile-bridge at Juvisy. On the 26th of January intelligence was received from Ver sailles, at Gros Bois, that negotiations had been opened with the French Government. The siege batteries in the rayon of the Wurtemberg Division were ordered to cease firing on the night of the 26th. A change was soon observed in the attitude of the French outposts. Towards mid-day they ceased working at the entrenchments, appeared unarmed in smaller and larger groups, and even endeavoured to establish a friendly understanding with the outposts on our side. The whole demeanour of the enemy showed that he was very weary of fighting. In spite of the peaceful aspect of the enemy, an order was issued from headquarters, recommending renewed watchfulness on the part of the outposts, and constant readiness for action on the part of the whole Army Corps. It was not considered improbable that part of the garrison of Paris might make a desperate attempt to break through. At 3 A.M. on the 29th of January a telegram was received from Versailles, announcing that an armistice had been concluded for 21 days (up to Feb. 19th), and ordering one Inf. Div. to be at Mont Mesly, and the other at Limeil, at 8.30 A.M. An additional order was issued from the headquarters of the Corps for the Cuirassier Brigade and the Reserve Artillery to be in rear of Boissy at the same hour ; the outposts were to maintain their positions. It was further ordered, that as the rayon of cantonments was to be extended, the 2nd Inf. Div., reinforced by five batteries of the Reserve Artillery, should stand nearest to Paris, and the ist Inf. Div. in rear of the 2nd Inf. Div. Some delay occurred in taking over Fort Charenton, and in occupying the new position, as the French officer bearing the report"], [386, "378 The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. of the evacuation only appeared at the outposts in the after noon ; the new garrison was unable to enter the fort until 4.30 p.m. Lieut-Col\". Massenbach was appointed Commandant, and the garrison consisted of the ist Batn. 12th Regt, two 6-pounder Batteries, one 12-pounder Battery, and one company of Engineers. The Fort was in every respect in perfect condition. The guns stood on the ramparts, with the ammunition either piled beside them or stored in the various magazines. The barrack stores of the casemated and other barracks, and of the officers' quarters, were all complete, and the whole appearance of the work, the numerous traverses on the ramparts, as well as the deep trenches which were made in all directions in the interior, were evidence of the wonderful industry and dexterity with which the garrison had prepared for an attack. The principal booty taken in the Fort was 93 guns, viz., 8 rifled ship's guns, 33 rifled and 34 smooth-bored land guns, and 18 mortars, together with a considerable quantity of powder, ammu nition, and biscuit, and a complete iron field-oven* As soon as Fort Charenton was occupied, the necessary precau tions against an attack from Paris were taken, and the field-guns placed on the ramparts. Two battalions were cantoned in Charenton, to secure the place on the side towards Paris and to furnish the outposts. The videttes moved to the line indicated in the agreement, and entered into communication with those of the Wiirtemberg Division at the Obelisk in the Bois-de-Vincennes. Communications were opened with the VI. Corps, on the left bank of the Seine, by means of the bridge on the west of Alfort Our troops occupied the positions previously held by the enemy without any collision occurring. In Alfort and the village of Charenton a considerable number of French soldiers had been left behind unarmed, and were sent on the following day to Paris, but no conflict occurred at any point. In accordance with the provisions of the armistice, 950 German prisoners, escorted by 500 French Gendarmes, arrived at our out posts on the afternoon of Jan. 31st, and were at once sent to their respective regiments. Among those belonging to the I. Corps were the officer and three men that had lost their way when patrolling. * This was found later."], [387, "In the Line of Investment. 379 In addition to the repairs of the matdriel and the improvement of the cantonments, the troops of the first line were principally occupied with the control of the passengers and of the trains conveying provisions. Paris had been literally on the verge of starvation, and the courage of its inhabitants had sunk to a very low ebb, but, with the return of plenty, it once more rose to its former pitch of insolence. The outpost duty was fatiguing and thankless, but abounded in interesting scenes and incidents. Our soldiers often found it more difficult to resist the insidious persuasions of elegantly-dressed enemies in high heels and chignons, who invariably wished to pass precisely where it was against orders, than the attacks of Chanzy's soldiers in La Beauce. The exodus from Paris was continually on the increase ; on the last day of January 255 persons left the city, and on February 6th 1,121. The Bavarian War Office had been most energetic in filling up vacancies in the ranks as they occurred. The establishment of the I. Corps was 27,600 infantry, 2,100 cavalry, and 114 guns ; its actual strength, on the ioth of February, was 23,700 infantry, 2,100 cavalry, and 114 guns. It was, therefore, almost up to its full strength. In spite of the decision and clearness with which the German conditions had been stated, the negotiations between Versailles and Bordeaux proceeded but slowly, and the armistice was twice prolonged ; once for five, and again for two days. On the 26th of February the preliminaries of peace were signed, and an order was sent to the I. Corps, that no more requisitions or contributions were to be exacted. On the 7th of March the Wiirtemberg Division, the I. Bavarian Corps, and the XII. Saxon Corps, paraded under the command of H.R.H. the Crown Prince of Saxony, for the inspection of H.M. the Emperor. The troops took up a position on the plateau north of Villiers, the scene of the sanguinary engagements of the 30th Nov. and the 1st and 2nd Dec. fronting to the south, with the Wiirtemberg Division on the right, the I. Corps on the left, and the XII. Corps in rear of both. The troops were drawn up in contiguous close columns, the Infantry in first line, the Cavalry and Artillery in second line."], [388, "The Operations of the I. Bavarian Army Corps. 380 At noon H.M. the Emperor, attended by a numerous suite, appeared at the northern entrance of Villiers, and rode slowly along the front of the three Corps, amid the deafening cheers of the troops, the flourish of trumpets, and the strains of bands. The troops then marched past; H. I. H. the Crown Prince of Germany riding at the head of the I. Corps. The 4th and 8th Regts. were the first detachments of the Corps, that turned their faces to the east, and marched, if not to their homes, at any rate into permanent barracks. These Regiments were to form part of the garrison of Metz. On the ioth of March the III. Army commenced to evacuate the left bank of the Seine, in accordance with the preliminaries of the treaty; and by the 18th it was in a rayon, the front of which extended from Fort Romainville up the Seine as far as Nogent sur-Seine. The 1. Corps was the only part of the III. Army already on the right bank of the Seine, and therefore maintained its general position, only extending on the north by Fort Nogent as far as the redoubt of Fontenay, and on the south beyond Melun. On the right of the I. Corps was the XI. (headquarters at Claye), and on the left the VI. Corps (headquarters at Nangis). The garrisons of the redoubts of Fontenay, Faisanderie, and Gravelle were furnished by a batn. 13th Regt. Only a weak line of outposts was established along the line of demarcation, as the armed permanent fortifications and the Seine offered sufficient supports. On the 13th of March, the verbal rumours and newspaper reports of the increasing opposition in Paris to the Government, that had hardly been constituted or recognized by the foreign powers, were confirmed by a telegraphic despatch from the headquarters of the Army. It was intimated that no opposition should be made to the occupation by General Vinoy's troops of the neutral zone under the walls of Paris, during the operations to be conducted against the National Guards, who were in insurrection. On the evening of the 19th of March, some Germans who had fled from Paris brought the news, which was confirmed by French newspapers, that the insurrection had risen to such a pitch of disorder, lawlessness, and terrorism, that, in order to ensure the safety of the German line of investment, it would be necessary to adopt military precautions."], [389, "In the Line of Investment. 381 Our outposts could not perceive any appearance of an attack, nor had the insurrection affected our position in any way ; but it was within the range of possibility, that the German troops might be affected by the outbreak, or that a powerful sortie might be made with a view to carrying the disaffection into the provinces. These considerations induced General v. d. Tann, without awaiting further instructions, to order the ist Inf. Div. to take up a more advanced position, and the 2nd Inf. Div. to strengthen the garri sons of the forts and earthworks and also the outposts. These precautions were approved of by the Commander-in-Chief. Fort Charenton, which had been completely disarmed, was armed with a 6-pounder Battery ; the Redoubts of Gravelle, Faisan derie, and Fontenay were still armed with heavy guns, and the Infantry of the garrison was doubled. Up to the 25th of March nothing occurred to indicate the unusual state of affairs in Paris, with the exception of the almost complete cessation of traffic to and from the city after the event ful 1 8th of March. In a general order published by the headquarters on the 2 1st of March, the troops before Paris were directed to remain in obser vation, but those who then held the reins of power in Paris were to be informed, that hostilities would at once be resumed, if the German troops, or the completion and execution of the prelimi naries of the treaty, were interfered with in the slightest degree. The concentration of the I. Corps again called forth an expression of approval, and a similar concentration of the other Corps before Paris was ordered on March 23rd. If the Parisians attempted to arm the enceinte, they would be treated as enemies ; any further attempt would be checked by artillery fire, which could be easily accomplished, as on the 24th of March Fort Charenton was occupied by the 6th Garrison Com pany of Prussian Guards, and eighteen 12-pounder guns* The most careful reconnaissance, however, failed to detect any guns upon the enceinte, and the Revolutionary party in Paris carefully avoided offering any provocation. The insurrection in Paris had forced the French Government to make many advances to the conquerors, distasteful as they must have been, and caused many families to seek the protection of the * Major Girl, of the General Staff, had been appointed Commandant of Fort Charenton and Major Staudacher, of the ist Div. of Engineers, Commandant of Fort Nogent."], [390, "382 The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. hated Germans, if only out of consideration for their lives and property. The I. Corps did not avail itself of the permission, received from headquarters at the beginning of April, to reoccupy the former extended cantonments on there being no immediate prospect of renewed hostilities. The left wing of the Army was, tactically speaking, unfavour ably situated, more especially that part of it on the tongue of land between the Seine and the Marne, which was commanded by the left bank of the Seine in possession of the Parisians ; it appeared, therefore, desirable to keep the troops in a complete state of readiness. The 2nd Inf. Div., which had stood in first line for three months, retired on April 2nd. (Headquarters of the Division to Piple Chateau, headquarters of the Brigades to Boissy and Yeres.) The ist Inf. Div. was brought to the front. (Headquarters of the Division to St. Maur, headquarters of the Brigades to Charenton St. Maurice, and Nogent-sur-Marne.) The position of the Army before Paris was very peculiar. We had gained the victory after a long and severe struggle and were now spectators, while our vanquished enemies turned their arms against each other. The roar of the guns was louder than at any period of the bombardment ; the Insurgents, after the manner of undisciplined troops, fired almost continuously by day and by night, while the Government troops replied with moderation. By a curious caprice of fate in this chain of unforeseen and un expected events, the French troops of the Line now made use of the German earthworks, that had originally been thrown up to assist in reducing Paris. The plateau, which had been defended by our II. Army Corps for 120 days, and upon which thousands of shells had fallen from the Parisian Forts and the enceinte, was now occupied by the French artillery ; the guns pointing towards Paris, in the defence of which city the same troops had shed so much blood. Truly a strange turn of Fortune's wheel ! During the course of April 25th, our outposts observed, that guns were placed on the ramparts of the Fort of Vincennes, and that the southern and eastern fronts were strengthened with sand bags. A closer reconnaissance proved that 13 guns were mounted."], [391, "In the Line of Investment. 383 The statement of the Commandant of Vincennes, that this arma ment was not intended for use against the German Army, but was in anticipation of our evacuation of Fort Charenton, and its occupation by the Versailles troops, which according to the news papers was to take place almost immediately, was credible, but was opposed to the spirit and the letter of the Convention. A telegraphic report was forwarded to headquarters, and during the night of April 23rd an order was received to send an officer on the following day to Paris, with the summons to disarm Vincennes within 24 hours, as otherwise the bombardment of that Fort would be at once recommenced. The officer reached Paris at mid-day on April 24th, and brought back the written reply that the summons would be obeyed. Before the expiration of the given time, on the morning of April 25th, a report in writing, that the disarmament had been completed, was received from Pascal Grousset, the Communal delegate for Foreign Affairs. The observance of the Convention was strictly enforced, and when a few days later the unsatisfactory news was received, that Vincennes was garrisoned with 1,800 men instead of 200 as agreed upon, and that the guns were still upon the ramparts, a categorical summons was again sent to Paris, and an officer was ordered to ascertain personally the state of affairs in the Fort. This officer* found only a few National Guards, acting as police men, in the village of Vincennes, while in the Fort itself there was a garrison of barely 200 men ; the guns had been dismounted and lay in the interior of the Fort, together with a good many gun carriages and a few mounted guns. On May 15 th, the newspapers contained the report of the peace, which had been definitely concluded on the ioth at Frankfort-am- Main. On the same day an order was received from headquarters, that H.M. the Emperor of Germany directed the Army to be con centrated towards Paris and Versailles. The movement was to be completed on the 16th and 17th of May. The I. Corps was ordered to concentrate on the part of its former rayon, that was on the right of the Yeres, the part on the left of the stream was to be occupied by the VI. Corps, which was moving down the Seine. * Major Girl of the General Staff."], [392, "384 The Operations of the i. Bavarian Army Corps. This order did not entail any important alteration in the relative positions of the troops ; by a little arrangement the necessary space was obtained. The ist Inf. Div. still remained in first line along the line of demarkation and the 2nd Inf. Div. in second line. On the 20th of May a confidential order was sent from head quarters, that such arrangements should be made, that on receipt of a telegraphic order, Paris could at once be completely invested by the German troops. The occupation of the neutral zone as far as the enceinte (with the exception of the Fort of Vincennes), was now permitted, in accordance with Article No. 7 of the treaty of peace. It was left to the discretion of the Army Corps to use the permission, in so far as it would tend to lighten the duties. This permission was conveyed to the headquarters of the 1st and 2nd Inf. Divs., and was followed on the night of the 21st of May by the order to complete the chain of investment. The end of the social drama, of which we had been unwilling spectators for more than two months, was fast approaching. To prevent the line of investment from being broken through, the ist Inf. Div., as well as two Batteries of the 2nd Inf. Div., remained in constant readiness, and strong supports were placed in rear of the line of outposts. The necessity of maintaining the line of investment had increased, as according to an official despatch the Government troops had entered Paris by the Porte St. Cloud on the morning of the 22nd of May, and the French police had been ordered to pursue fugitive members of the Commune. The last sanguinary act was played out before our eyes in all its brutal passion and impotent wrath, between the 23rd and the 27th of May. The progress of the Government troops through the town could be followed by the thunder of the guns, and the rattle of the mitrailleuses and rifles. The thick clouds of smoke from the burning buildings rose above the smoke of the guns. By day a thick veil of smoke lay over the greater part of Paris, while by night the country for miles around was lit up by the flames, which were consuming many splendid palaces and buildings. The restoration of the German Empire at Versailles on the i8tl of January, and this wild struggle of the Commune, with its in^"], [393, "In the Line of Investment. 385 human mania for destruction, afforded us the highest moral satisfaction. On one side was a nation united by the war that had been forced upon it, which now, sword in hand and conscious of its own power, gave expression to its unity, in the centre of a sub jugated country. On the other side was a nation, which, after enduring a defeat unparalleled in history, once more seized arms and torches, not to make a last desperate attempt against the conqueror, but to destroy itself before the eyes of the hated foe. If our shells had destroyed in three months the hundredth part of what the Parisians annihilated in a week in their blind wrath and fiendish calculation, the whole world would have called us barbarians and savages, bent on destruction whether necessary or not. The struggle of the Commune, and its abortive attempts, proved how deeply the canker had eaten into the heart of France ; Frenchmen and Parisians did not scruple to do what the roughest German soldier would have shrunk from, and they hardly troubled themselves to hide their deeds under the usual cloak of euphemistic phrases. To contemplate this volcano, which was consumed in its own flames, and to keep watch before Paris, while she destroyed her self, afforded us a more complete and lasting moral satisfaction than the proudest victory. A brisk fire was kept up during the night of the 24th' of May from the works of Haute Bruyeres, Bicetre, and Ivry. Towards morning the firing ceased, and at daybreak the Insurgents could be seen retreating towards the city, partly in regular formation, partly in disordered groups, while the Government troops drew near and reconnoitred the position. At 10 A.M., May 25th, the Tricolor floated from Fort Bicetre, and in the afternoon fire was opened upon the gorge of Ivry, from which the Communists were effecting a hasty retreat. Firing was kept up on both sides till 6 p.m. Shortly afterwards a considerable explosion occurred in the in terior of Fort Ivry.

On the following day the garrison of Vincennes was strengthened by another battalion, and the village of St. Mande was occupied by one battalion. The troops of the ist Inf. Div., which were further to the rear, with two squadrons Cuirassier Brigade and part of the 2nd Inf. Div., changed their cantonments accordingly. The necessary measures had been taken to repulse the Insur gents, in case they should try to break through our line, but not the slightest attempt was made. On the 23rd of May we prevented some unarmed officers of the Commune from passing through our lines ; on the 24th we refused to permit about 3,000 women, chil dren, and old men to leave Ivry ; and finally on the 26th about 20 Insurgents, who ran out of the railway gate at St. Mande and threw away their arms, were sent back again. After that, there were no more attempts to escape from Paris. The advance of the outposts on the 25th of May brought Vin cennes completely within our rayon. The Commandant, who had been engaged in negotiations since the 23rd of May with an officer of the Versailles Army with regard to the handing over of the Fort to the well-disposed portion of the Garde Nationale, was informed that he had two hours in which to retire to Paris. Only 100 men availed themselves of this permission, the remainder stayed in the Fort, which at the expiration of the given time was closely invested by our outposts. All communication between the Fort and Paris was interrupted by cutting the telegraph wire. The Government troops continued their advance with severe contests, and pushed forward on the right bank of the Seine along the enceinte as far as Charonne, in front of the I. Army Corps. On the 29th of May the Fort of Vincennes. surrendered to the troops of General Vinoy, who, with the permission of the German Commander-in-Chief, placed a garrison of 200 men in the Fort. The surrender of the point d'appui of the Commune was the last act in this mournful drama. The last shots heard in the war were fired by Frenchmen against Frenchmen,\u2014 summary justice was being meted out to the captured Insurgents."], [395, "In the Line of Investment. 387 The 2nd Inf. Div. had been destined for some time to remain in France with the Army of occupation, and on the 2nd of June the order was received for the remainder of the I. Army Corps to march back to Germany by Vitry and Nancy. The I. Army Corps fought in 18 battles and engagements, in 10 of which the whole of its troops took part, without counting the collisions of small detachments with the enemy. The losses of the Army Corps in the field were as follows : \u2014 Killed or mortally wounded, 205 officers, 2,428 men. Wounded, 334 \u201e 6,875 - 539 officers, 9,303 men. Of all the German Corps the 1. Bavarian Army Corps suffered the heaviest losses, with the exception of the III. Corps and the Prussian Guards. The former lost 594 officers, 11,182 men, and the latter lost 423 officers, 9,604 men. Although the I. Corps could not boast of having forced any fortresses to capitulate, it captured on five different battle-fields 12 field-guns, 1 Eagle, 6 Standards, and also captured about 5,000 prisoners, and 6 heavy guns, which had been abandoned in various earthworks. The work is in reality but half completed. In a short time, perhaps sooner than we anticipate, we shall be called upon to defend what we have conquered with so much difficulty, and fresh sacrifices will be necessary, in order that thousands of brave men may not have shed their blood in vain on the fields of Worth, Sedan, and La Beauce. The present can only be regarded as an armistice, the expiration of which is uncertain ! \"We hope that the reminiscences of these days of triumph of Germany and Bavaria, which we have endeavoured to present to the reader, may assist us in making the best use of the truce, so that in the coming struggle we may greet the first roar of the cannon, with full confidence in our own strength and resources, and with a joyful shout of \"God save the King!

In the German service, in addition to the Army for field purposes, there is an organization termed the Etappe, which undertakes all arrangements connected with the lines of communication, including the necessary precautions for safety, and the duties of transport between the Army in the field and its base. The Ersatz Reserve consists of men who in ordinary times are not called upon to serve, but who are called in, on the order for mobilization, to fill up gaps as they occur in the ranks. The literal translation is \" Reserve to replace.\" A certain contingent from the population is required yearly for the German Army. Those who are not eligible or willing to serve for one year as \" Einjahrige Freiwillige\" draw lots, and those who draw lucky numbers, and those who are excused service in times of peace on certain other grounds, are drafted into the Ersatz Reserve, which includes the \" Einjdbrige Freiwillige \" after their year of service. The Ersatz Reserve, therefore, consists almost entirely of untrained men. Soldiers serve in the Germany Army for three years continuously, but men who pass a certain educational test, and are willing to provide their own uniforms, are permitted to volunteer, before the lots are drawn, for one year's service, in lieu of compulsorily serving for three years, as they would have to do, should they draw unlucky numbers. These men are called \" Einjahrige Freiwillige \" (volunteers for one year). Woodsall and Kinder, Printers, Milford Lane, Strand. London, \\V.C"], [405, ""], [406, ""], [407, ""], [408, ""]]
