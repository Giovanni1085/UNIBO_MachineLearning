I Hott&on MACMILLAN AND CO., Ltd. NEW YORK : THE MACMILLAN CO. 1896 All rights resented"], [8, ""], [9, "PREFACE In these two volumes are collected the best of those plays founded on English history that have been spared to us from the larger supply existing in Shakespeare's time, \u2014 fire, neglect, and perhaps fanaticism, having deprived us of many others. Taking Shakespeare's ten chronicles as a basis, nearly all the gaps that he left in the continuity of his English history are here filled in with plays written by his contemporaries : Peele, Marlowe, Heywood, and Ford having all lived in the time of the great master. We have thus placed before us a series of plays by our greatest dramatists, representing the chief incidents of three hundred years, among the most eventful in English history. These are not, however, mere reprints of the old plays, but they are resettings of them in what is thought to be the simplest and most effective form for dramatic performance. It need hardly be said that all these plays were written to be acted, and yet fully one half are unknown to the modern stage, while many of them have not been produced in an English theatre since the time of the Stuarts ; the reason commonly assigned for this neglect being that, as written, they cannot be acted. Indeed, in the form in which we"], [10, "VI ENGLISH HISTORICAL PLA YS have received them, most of these plays could not now be produced, the continual shifting of scene, alone, proving too severe a strain on both the patience of the audience and the resources of the manager. It was easy enough in the olden time to portion a play into thirty scenes, when the shifting was done by suggestion, and the scenery sketched in a glory of words by the poet. To the onlooker there was no inherent absurdity in a long rhetorical parley between a general in camp, and the enemy on the lofty walls of a besieged city, so long as no attempt was made to construct the scene pictorially. Nor, indeed, need there have been any hesitation in fighting battles before specta tors whose criticism was disarmed in advance by a pleading apology for shortcomings, and upon whose imagination a burden was adroitly cast, that in our more languid age would be scornfully discarded. Shakespeare himself makes the appeal \u2014 Pardon, gentles all, . . . O pardon ! ... let us On your imaginary forces work. Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts ; Into a thousand parts divide one man, And make imaginary puissance ; Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth ; For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings. And again \u2014 O for pity ! we shall much disgrace With four or five most vile and ragged foils, Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous, The name of Agincourt."], [11, "PREFACE VN To-day, however, realism rules in the drama. The best of plays will have no hearing unless the stage is filled with pictures closely resembling nature ; while the painter shares with actor and author the plaudits of every audience. Any attempt, therefore, to restore these plays to the theatre must be attended by an effort to bring them in line with the altered conditions of the stage. The result of such an effort is now put forward, not without long and careful thought, in the hope that these superb historical plays will be at length rescued from the semi-oblivion of our libraries, to be assigned, once for all, an honoured place on our national stage. The principal changes made in adapting these plays are as follows : \u2014 (i) By a new division of acts and scenes, nearly all the battles are now fought between the Acts, and therefore out of sight. (2) Chiefly by the elision of redundant and unimportant scenes, nearly one hundred changes of scene have been suppressed in fourteen plays. (3) For some of the plays a more effective ending has been found, either by transposing a scene, or by omitting an anti-climax. Many passages have also been omitted as being either gross, tedious, trivial, obscure or unintelligible, and such omissions should not be regretted by the reader, whose way is thereby rendered all the more pleasant. While the general aim has been to give to each play the form best suited for dramatic effect, and although there is not a scene in excess, it will yet be necessary, in some cases, to"], [12, "ENGLISH HISTORICAL PLA YS VM further condense scenes for the stage, in order to quicken the action and to reduce the time occupied in performance. Literary beauty has in no case been sacrificed merely to shorten a scene. The following are the plays which exhibit the greatest novelty in structure. Peek's Edivard I. is put together with fragments of his long but sadly mutilated play ; all previous efforts of editors having failed to make any considerable portion of the play intelligible. It is not pretended that this play has conspicuous merit ; its main interest arising from its being the oldest of the series. Marlowe's Edward II. is given almost unabridged. The author's own melodious song of the \"Passionate Shepherd\" has been introduced, in order to eke out a somewhat meagre^ scene. Shakespeare's Henry IV. is now presented as one long play in five acts. The three parts of Henry VI. have been re-cast, the first play now ending with Margaret's marriage, the second with the death of York, and the third with the murder of Margaret's son. i Edward IV. is condensed from two plays by Heywood. Its delightful comic scenes serve to break the monotone of death-cries heard through the reigns of Henry VI. and Richard III. The play of Henry VIII. ends with Queen Katharine's death, its true dramatic climax. Some verbal emendations, and a few fresh readings will be found, but there is neither wish nor occasion to defend"], [13, "PREFACE IX them here ; the main object of this work being to render the plays popular. These chronicle plays are a peculiar glory of our own literature, and they may well be the envy of all others ; but our appreciation of their value has greatly fallen since they have ceased to be acted. We have ample evidence that, at one time, by means of these plays, the English people learned their country's history : it can hardly be maintained that they no longer need such instruction. Heywood informs us that in his time \" Plays have made the ignorant more apprehensive, taught the unlearned the knowledge of many famous histories, in structed such as cannot read in the discovery of all our English chronicles ; and what man have you now of that weak capacity that cannot discourse of any notable thing recorded even from William the Conqueror, nay, from the landing of Brute until this day ? \" Again, in more recent times such famous men as the first Marlborough, Chatham, and Southey are said to have acknowledged their debt to Shakespeare for the foundations of their knowledge of English history : while Coleridge, having adduced proof that formerly the people were familiar with these plays, maintained that \" it would be a fine national custom to act such a series of dramatic histories in orderly succession.\" If the work now submitted to the public will contribute to the growth of so wholesome and patriotic a custom, its end will be happily accomplished."], [14, ""], [15, "CONTENTS BY PAGE King John ....

Our strong possession and our right for us. Eli. Your strong possession much more than your right, Or else it must go wrong with you and me : So much my conscience whispers in your ear, Which none but Heaven and you and I shall hear.

K. John. What art thou ? Rob. The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge. K. John. Is that the elder, and art thou the heir ? You came not of one mother then, it seems. Phil. Most certain of one mother, mighty king ; That is well known : and, as I think, one father : But, for the certain knowledge of that truth"], [21, "KING JOHN SCENE I 5 I put you o'er to Heaven, and to my mother : Of that I doubt, as all men's children may. Eli. Out on thee, rude man, thou dost shame thy mother, And wound her honour with this diffidence. Phil. I, madam ? no, I have no reason for it That is my brother's plea and none of mine ; The which if he can prove, 'a pops me out At least from fair five hundred pound a year. Heaven guard my mother's honour, and my land ! K. John. A good blunt fellow. \u2014 Why, being younger born, Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance ? Phil. I know not why, except to get the land. And whe'r I be as true begot, or no, That still I lay upon my mother's head ; But, that I am as well begot, my liege, Compare our faces, and be judge yourself. If old Sir Robert did beget us both, And were our father, and this son like him : \u2014 O old Sir Robert, father, on my knee I give Heaven thanks I was not like to thee ! K. John. Why, what a madcap hath Heaven lent us here ! Eli. He hath a trick of C\u0153ur-de-Lion's face ; The accent of his tongue affecteth him. Do you not read some tokens of my son In the large composition of this man ? K. John. Mine eye hath well examined his parts, And finds them perfect Richard. \u2014 Sirrah, speak : What doth move you to claim your brother's land ? Phil. Because he hath a half-face like my father ? With that half-face would he have all my land. Rob. My gracious liege, when that my father lived Your brother did employ my father much, And once despatched him in an embassy To Germany, there, with the emperor, To treat of high affairs touching that time. The advantage of his absence took the king, And in the mean time sojourned at my father's ; Where how he did prevail I shame to speak, As I have heard my father speak himself.

Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine, My father's land, as was my father's will. K. John. Sirrah, your brother is legitimate ; Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him ; Your father's heir must have your father's land. Rob. Shall then my father's will be of no force To dispossess that child which is not his ? Phil. Of no more force to dispossess me, sir, Than was his will to get me, as I think. Eli. Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge, And, like thy brother, to enjoy thy land, Or the reputed son of C\u0153ur-de-Lion, Lord of thy presence, and no land beside ? Phil. Madam, an if my brother had my shape And I had his, Sir Robert his, like him ; And if my legs were two such riding-rods, My arms such eel-skins stuffed, my face so thin, And, to his shape, were heir to all this land, Would I might never stir from off this place I'd give it every foot to have this face : I would not be Sir Nob in any case. Eli. I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune, Bequeath thy land to him, and follow me ? I am a soldier, and now bound to France. Phil. Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance. Your face hath got five hundred pounds a year, Yet sell your face for fivepence, and 'tis dear. \u2014 Madam, I'll follow you unto the death. Eli. Nay, I would have you go before me thither. Phil. Our country manners give our betters way. K. John. What is thy name ? Phil. Philip, my liege ; so is my name begun; Good old Sir Robert's wife's true eldest son. K. John.

This ' once again,' but that your highness pleased, Was once superfluous : you were crowned before, And that high royalty was ne'er plucked off, The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt ; Fresh expectation troubled not the land With any longed-for change, or better state. Sal. Therefore, to be possessed with double pomp, To guard a title, that was rich before, To gild refined gold, to paint the lily, To throw a perfume on the violet, To smooth the ice, or add another hue Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish, Is wasteful and ridiculous excess. Pern. But that your royal pleasure must be done, This act is as an ancient tale new-told, And in the last repeating troublesome, Being urged at a time unseasonable. Sal. In this, the antique and well-noted face Of plain old form is much disfigured ; And, like a shifted wind unto a sail, It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about, Startles and frights consideration, Makes sound opinion sick, and truth suspected, For putting on so new a fashioned robe.

Some reasons of this double coronation I have possessed you with, and think them strong ; And more, more strong, when lesser is my fear, I shall indue you with : meantime, but ask What you would have reformed that is not well ; And well shall you perceive how willingly I will both hear and grant you your requests.

We cannot hold mortality's strong hand. \u2014 Good lords, although my will to give is living, The suit which you demand is gone and dead : He tells us, Arthur is deceased to-night. Sal. Indeed, we feared his sickness was past cure. Pern. Indeed, we heard how near his death he was, Before the child himself felt he was sick. This must be answered, either here, or hence. K. John. Why do you bend such solemn brows on me ? Think you I bear the shears of destiny ? Have I commandment on the pulse of life ? Sal. It is apparent foul play ; and 'tis shame That greatness should so grossly offer it. So thrive it in your game ! and so farewell. Pern. Stay yet, Lord Salisbury ; I'll go with thee, And find the inheritance of this poor child, His little kingdom of a forced grave.

How I have sped among the clergymen, The sums I have collected shall express. But as I travelled hither through the land I find the people strangely fantasied, Possessed with rumours, full of idle dreams, Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear.

Old men, and beldams, in the streets Do prophesy upon it dangerously. Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths ; And when they talk of him, they shake their heads And whisper one another in the ear ; And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist, Whilst he that hears makes fearful action, With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes. I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus, The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool, With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news. Who, with his shears and measure in his hand, Standing on slippers (which his nimble haste Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet), Told of a many thousand warlike French, That were embatteled and ranked in Kent : \u2014 Another lean unwashed artificer Cuts off\" his tale, and talks of Arthur's death.

My nobles leave me, and my state is braved, Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers : Nay, in the body of this fleshly land, This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath, Hostility and civil tumult reigns Between my conscience and my cousin's death. Hub. Arm you against your other enemies, I'll make a peace between your soul and you. Young Arthur is alive : this hand of mine Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand, Not painted with the crimson spots of blood. Within this bosom never entered yet The dreadful motion of a murderous thought ; And you have slandered nature in my form, Which, howsoever rude exteriorly, Is yet the cover of a fairer mind Than to be butcher of an innocent child.

I know, my sovereign \u2014 in my husband's love, Who now doth loyal service in his wars \u2014 Doth but to try the wife of Salisbury, Whether she will hear a wanton's tale, or no ; Lest being therein guilty by my stay, From that, not from my liege, I turn away.

O, that a man might hold the heart's close book ; And choke the lavish tongue, when it doth utter The breath of falsehood not characters there ! War. Far be it from the honour of my age, That I should owe bright gold, and render lead ! Age is a cynic, not a flatterer : I say again, that, if I knew your grief, And that by me it may be lessened, My proper harm should buy your highness' good. Edw. These are the vulgar tenders of false men, That never pay the duty of their words. Thou wilt not stick to swear what thou hast said ; But, when thou know'st my grief's condition, This rash-disgorged vomit of thy word Thou wilt eat up again, and leave me helpless. War. By heaven, I will not : though your majesty Did bid me run upon your sword, and die. Edw. Say, that my grief is no way med'cinable, But by the loss and bruising of thine honour ? War.

What wilt thou say to one that breaks an oath ? War. That he hath broke his faith with God and man, And from them both stands excommunicate. Edw. What office were it, to suggest a man To break a lawful and religious vow ? War. An office for the devil, not for man. Edw. That devil's office must thou do for me !

And therefore, Warwick, if thou art thyself, The lord and master of thy word and oath, Go to thy daughter ; and, in my behalf, Command her, woo her, win her any ways, To be my mistress, and my secret love.

Well may I tempt myself to wrong myself, When he hath sworn me by the name of God, To break a vow made by the name of God. What if I swear by this right hand of mine, To cut this right hand off? the better way Were, to prophane the idol, than confound it : But neither will I do ; I'll keep my oath, And to my daughter make a recantation Of all the virtue I have preach'd to her : I'll say, she must forget her husband Salisbury, If she remember, to embrace the king ; I'll say, an oath may easily be broken ; But not so easily pardon'd, being broken ; I'll say, it is true charity to love, But not true love to be so charitable ; I'll say, his greatness may bear out the shame, But not his kingdom can buy out the sin ; I'll say, it is my duty to persuade, But not her honesty to give consent."], [206, "KING EDWARD III ACT II 190 Enter Countess.

The sun, that withers hay, doth nourish grass ; The king, that would distain thee, will advance thee. The poets write, that great Achilles' spear Could heal the wound it made : the moral is, What mighty men misdo, they can amend. The king will in his glory hide thy shame ; And those, that gaze on him to find out thee, Will lose their eyesight, looking in the sun. The king's great name will temper thy misdeeds, And give the bitter potion of reproach A sugar'd sweet and most delicious taste : Besides, it is no harm, to do the thing Which without shame could not be left undone.

No marvel, though the branches be infected, When poison hath encompassed the root : No marvel, though the leprous infant die, When the stern dam envenometh the dug.

At Cressy field our clouds of warlike smoke Chok'd up those French moths, and dissevered them : But now their multitudes of millions hide, Masking as 'twere, the beauteous burning sun ; Leaving no hope to us, but sullen dark, And eyeless terror of all-ending night. Aud. This sudden, mighty, and expedient head, That they have made, fair prince, is wonderful. Before us in the valley lies the king, Vantag'd with all that heaven and earth can yield ; His party stronger battled than our whole : His son, the braving Duke of Normandy, Hath trimm'd the mountain on our right hand up In shining plate, that now the aspiring hill Shows like a silver quarry, or an orb ; Aloft the which, the banners, bannerets, And new-replenish'd pendants, cuff the air, And beat the wind, that, for their gaudiness, Struggles to kiss them : on our left hand lies Philip, the younger issue of the king, Coating the other hill in such array,"], [229, "SCENE I KING EDWARD III 213 That all his gilded upright pikes do seem Strait trees of gold, the pendant streamers, leaves And their device of antique heraldry, Quartered in colours seeming sundry fruits, Makes it the orchard of the Hesperides : Behind us too the hill doth bear his height, (For, like a half-moon, op'ning but one way, It rounds us in) there at our backs are lodg'd The fatal cross-bows ; and the battle there Is govern'd by the rough Chatillion. Then thus it stands, \u2014 The valley for our flight The king binds in ; the hills on either hand Are proudly royalized by his sons ; And on the hill behind stands certain death, In pay and service with Chatillion. Pri. Death's name is much more mighty than his Thy parcelling this power hath made it more Than all the world ; then call it but a power. As many sands as these my hands can hold, deeds. Are but my handful of so many sands, Easily ta'en up, and quickly thrown away : But, if I stand to count them sand by sand, The number would confound my memory, And make a thousand millions of a task, Which, briefly, is no more indeed, than one. These quarters, squadrons, and these regiments, Before, behind us, and on either hand, Are but a power : When we name a man, His hand, his foot, his head, have several strengths ; And being all but one self instant strength, Why, all this many, Audley, is but one, And we can call it all but one man's strength. He, that hath far to go, tells it by miles ; If he should tell the steps, it kills his heart : The drops are infinite, that make a flood ; And yet, thou know'st, we call it but a rain. There is but one France, and one king of France, That France hath no more kings ; and that same king Hath but the puissant legion of one king ; And we have one : Then apprehend no odds ; For one to one is fair equality. \u2014"], [230, "KING EDWARD III ACT IV 214 Enter a Herald.

What is the answer to his proffer'd mercy ? Pri. This heaven, that covers France, contains the mercy That draws from me submissive orisons ; That such base breath should vanish from my lips, To urge the plea of mercy to a man, The Lord forbid !

Back with the beast unto the beast that sent him ; Tell him, I cannot sit a coward's horse : Bid him to-day bestride the jade himself ; For I will stain my horse quite o'er with blood, And double-gild my spurs, but I will catch him ; So tell the carping boy, and get thee gone.

Aud. To die is all as common, as to live ; The one in choice, the other holds in chase : For, from the instant we begin to live, We do pursue and hunt the time to die : First bud we, then we blow, and after seed ; Then, presently, we fall ; and as a shade"], [232, "KING EDWARD III 216 ACT IV Follows the body, so we follow death.

Pri. Ah, good old man, a thousand thousand armours These words of thine have buckled on my back : Ah, what an idiot hast thou made of life, To seek the thing it fears ! and how disgrac'd The imperial victory of murd'ring death !

Com'st thou because the anointed king is hence ? Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind, And in my loyal bosom lies his power. Were I but now the lord of such hot youth As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself, Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men, From forth the ranks of many thousand French, O, then, how quickly should this arm of mine, Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee, And minister correction to thy fault !

Even in condition of the worst degree, In gross rebellion, and detested treason : Thou art a banished man, and here art come Before the expiration of thy time In braving arms against thy sovereign.

And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace, Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye : You are my father, for methinks, in you I see old Gaunt alive : O, then, my father, Will you permit that I shall stand condemned A wandering vagabond, my rights and royalties Plucked from my arms perforce, and given away To upstart unthrifts ?

I am denied to sue my livery here, And yet my letters-patents give me leave : My father's goods are all distrained and sold. What would you have me do ? I am a subject, And challenge law.

Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher, and eat blackberries ? a question not to be asked. Shall the son of England prove a thief, and take purses ? a question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch : this pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile : so doth the company thou keepest : for, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears ; not in pleasure, but in passion ; not in words only, but in woes also : \u2014 and yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.

This thou wouldst say, \" Your son did thus and thus Your brother thus ; so fought the noble Douglas ; \" Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds : But in the end, to stop my ear indeed, Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise, Ending with \" Brother, son, and all are dead.\" Mor.

I'm sorry I should force you to believe That which I would to God I had not seen ; But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state, Rendering faint quittance, wearied and outbreath'd, To Harry Monmouth ; whose swift wrath beat down The never-daunted Percy to the earth, From whence with life he never more sprung up. In few, his death \u2014 whose spirit lent a fire Even to the dullest peasant in his camp \u2014 Being bruited once, took fire and heat away From the best-temper'd courage in his troops ; For from his metal was his party steel'd ; Which once in him abated, all the rest Turn'd on themselves. Then was the noble Worcester Too soon ta'en prisoner ; and that furious Scot, The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword Had three times slain th' appearance of the king, Gan vail his stomach, and did grace the shame Of those that turn'd their backs ; and in his flight, Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all Is, that the king hath won ; and hath sent out A speedy power to encounter you, my lord, Under the conduct of young Lancaster And Westmoreland. This is the news at full. North. For this I shall have time enough to mourn. In poison there is physic ; and these news, Having been well, that would have made me sick, Being sick, have in some measure made me well : My weaken'd limbs being now enrag'd with grief, Are thrice themselves.

And being now trimm'd in thine own desires, Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him, That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up. So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard ; And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up, And howl'st to find it. What trust is in these times ? They that, when Richard liv'd, would have him die, Are now become enamour'd on his grave : They, that threw dust upon his goodly head When through proud London he came sighing on After th' admired heels of Bolingbroke, Cry now, \" O earth, yield us that king again, And take thou this !

Who then persuaded you to stay at home ? There were two honours lost, \u2014 yours and your son's. For yours, \u2014 may heavenly glory brighten it ! For his, \u2014 it stuck upon him, as the sun In the gray vault of heaven ; and by his light Did all the chivalry of England move To do brave acts : he was, indeed, the glass Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves : He was the mark and glass, copy and book, That fashion'd others. And him, \u2014 O wondrous him ! O miracle of men ! \u2014 him did you leave \u2014 Second to none, unseconded by you \u2014 To look upon the hideous god of war In disadvantage ; to abide a field Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name Did seem defensible : \u2014 so you left him.

Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me : the brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent any thing that tends to laughter, more than I invent or is invented on me : I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then I have no judgment. Thou mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never manned with an agate till now : but I will set you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your master, for a jewel, \u2014 the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his cheek ; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor.

I looked 'a should have sent me two-and-twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he sends me security. Where's Bardolph ? Page. He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse. Fal. I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in Smithfield : an I could get me but a wife in the stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived. Page. Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the prince for striking him about Bardolph. Fal. Wait close ; I will not see him. Enter the Lord Chief-Justice and an Attendant. Ch. Just.

I give thee leave to tell me so ! I lay aside that which grows to me ! If thou gettest any leave of me, hang me ; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be hanged. You hunt counter : hence ! avaunt ! Atten. Sir, my lord would speak with you. Ch. Just. Sir John Falstaff, a word with you. Fal. My good lord ! \u2014 God give your lordship good time of day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad : I heard say your lordship was sick : I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in you, some relish of the saltness of time ; and I most humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care of your health. Ch. Just. Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury. Fal. An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is re turned with some discomfort from Wales. Ch. Just. I talk not of his majesty : \u2014 you would not come when I sent for you. Fal. And I hear, morever, his highness is fallen into this same apoplexy. Ch. Just. Well, God mend him ! \u2014 I pray you, let me speak with you. Fal. This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy, an't please your lordship ; a kind of sleeping in the blood, a sort of tingling. Ch. Just. What tell you me of it ? be it as it is. Fal. It hath its original from much grief, from study, and perturbation of the brain : I have read the cause of his effects in Galen ; it is a kind of deafness. Ch. Just. I think you are fallen into the disease ; for you hear not what I say to you. Fal. Very well, my lord, very well : rather, an't please you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady of not marking, that I am troubled withal. Ch. Just. To punish you by the heels would amend the"], [388, "KING HENR Y IV ACT IV 372 attention of your ears ; and I care not if I do become your physician. Fal. I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient : your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty ; but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a scruple, or, indeed, a scruple itself. Ch. Just. I sent for you, when there were matters against you for your life, to come speak with me. Fal. As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land-service, I did not come. Ch. Just. Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy. Fal. He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less. Ch. Just. Your means are very slender, and your waste is great. Fal. I would it were otherwise ; I would my means were greater, and my waist slenderer. Ch. Just. You have misled the youthful prince. Fal. The young prince hath misled me : I am the fellow with the great belly, and he my dog. Ch. Just. You follow the young prince up and down, like his ill angel. Fal. Not so, my lord ; your ill angel is light ; but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing. You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young ; you measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls : and we that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess, are wags too. Ch. Just. Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are written down old with all the characters of age ? Have you not a moist eye ? a dry hand ? a yellow cheek ? a white beard ? a decreasing leg ? an increasing belly ? is not your voice broken ? your wind short ? your chin double ? your wit single ? and every part about you blasted with antiquity ? and will you yet call yourself young ? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John ! Fal. My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon, with a white head and something a round belly. For my voice, \u2014 I have lost it with hallooing, and singing of anthems. To approve my youth further, I will not : the truth is, I am only old in judgment and understanding ; and he that"], [389, "SCENE II KING HENRY IV 373 will caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him. For the box of the ear that the prince gave you, \u2014 he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have checked him for it ; and the young lion repents, \u2014 marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk and old sack. Ch.Just. Well, God send the prince a better companion ! Fal. God send the companion a better prince ! I cannot rid my hands of him. Ch. Just. Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry : I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland. Fal. Yea ; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look you, pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home, that our armies join not in a hot day ; for, by the Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean not to sweat extraordi narily : if it be a hot day, an I brandish any thing but my bottle, I would I might never spit white again.

If ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give me rest. I would to God, my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is : I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion. Ch. Just. Well, be honest, be honest ; and God bless your expedition ! Fal. Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth ? Ch. Just.

It is more than for some, my lord ; it is for all, \u2014 all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home. Ch. Just. How comes this, Sir John ?

What is the gross sum that I owe thee ? Host. Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber, at the round table, by a sea coal fire, upon Wednesday in Wheeson-week, when the prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing- man of Windsor, \u2014 thou didst swear to me then, as I was washing thy wound, to marry me, and make me my lady thy wife.

And didst thou not kiss me, and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings ? I put thee now to thy book-oath : deny it, if thou canst. Fal. My lord, this is a poor mad soul ; and she says, up and down the town, that her eldest son is like you : she hath been in good case, and the truth is, poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them. Ch. Just. Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level consideration : you have, as it appears to me, practised upon the easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her serve your uses both in purse and in person. Host. Yea, in truth, my lord. Ch. Just. Prithee, peace. \u2014 Pay her the debt you owe her, and unpay the villany you have done her : the one you may do with sterling money, and the other with current re pentance. Fal. My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without reply.

I had thought weariness durst not have attached one of so high blood. P. Hen. Faith, it does me ; though it discolours the com plexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer ? Poin. Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition. P. Hen. Belike, then, my appetite was not princely got ; for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature, small beer. But, indeed, these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name ! or to know thy face to-morrow ! Poin. How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard, you should talk so idly !

But I tell thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick : and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostenta tion of sorrow. Poin. The reason ? P. Hen. What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep ? Poin. I would think thee a most princely hypocrite. P. Hen. It would be every man's thought ; and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks : never a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way better than thine : every man would think me an hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so ? Poin. Why, because you have been so lewd, and so much engraffed to Falstaff. P. Hen. And to thee. Poin. By this light, I am well spoke on ; I can hear it with mine own ears : the worst that they can say of me is, that I am a second brother, and that I am a proper fellow of my hands ; and those two things, I confess, I cannot help. \u2014 By the mass, here comes Peto.

And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow ? and your fairest daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen ? Sil. Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow ! Shal. By yea and nay, sir, I dare say my cousin William is become a good scholar : he is at Oxford still, is he not ? Sil. Indeed, sir, to my cost. Shal. A must, then, to the inns o' court shortly : I was once of Clement's-inn, where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet. Sil. You were called \"lusty Shallow\" then, cousin. Shal. By the mass, I was called any thing ; and I would have done any thing indeed too, and roundly too. There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire, and black George Bare, and Francis Pickbone, and Will Squele a Cotsol' man, \u2014 you had not four such swinge-bucklers in all the inns o' court again. Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk. Sil. This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers ? Shal. The same Sir John, the very same. I saw him break Skogan's head at the court-gate, when 'a was a crack not thus high : and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer, behind Gray's-inn. Ah ! the mad days that I have spent ! and to see how many of my old acquaintance are dead ! Sil. We shall all follow, cousin. Shal.

I do remember him at Clement's-inn, like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring. And now is this Vice's dagger become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John o' Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him ; and I'll be sworn 'a ne'er saw him but once in the Tilt- Yard ; and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John o' Gaunt he beat his own name ; for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin ; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a court : \u2014 and now has he land and beeves.

If that rebellion Came like itself, in base and abject routs, Led on by heady youth, guarded with rags, And countenanc'd by boys and beggary, \u2014 I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd, In his true, native, and most proper shape, You, reverend father, and these noble lords, Had not been here, to dress the ugly form Of bare and bloody insurrection With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop, \u2014 Whose see is by a civil peace maintain'd ; Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd ; Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd ; Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself Out of the speech of peace, that bears such grace, Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war ? Arch. I have in equal balance justly weigh'd What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer. And find our griefs heavier than our offences. We have the summary of all our griefs, When time shall serve, to show in articles ; Which long ere this we offer'd to the king, And might by no suit gain our audience : When we are wrong'd, and would unfold our griefs, We are denied access unto his person Even by those men that most have done us wrong. The dangers of the days but newly gone Whose memory is written on the earth With yet-appearing blood, and the examples Of every minute's instance, present now, Have put us in these ill-beseeming arms ; Not to break peace, or any branch of it, But to establish here a peace indeed, Concurring both in name and quality. West. When ever yet was your appeal denied ; Wherein have you been gallt_d by the king ? Here come I from our princely general To know your griefs ; to tell you from his grace That he will give you audience ; and wherein"], [405, "SCENE IV KING HENR Y IV 389 It shall appear that your demands are just, You shall enjoy them, \u2014 every thing set off That might so much as think you enemies. Mowb. But he hath forc'd us to compel this offer : And it proceeds from policy, not love. West. Mowbray, you overween to take it so ; This offer comes from mercy, not from fear : For, lo ! within a ken our army lies ; Upon mine honour, all too confident To give admittance to a thought of fear. Our battle is more full of names than yours, Our men more perfect in the use of arms, Our armour all as strong, our cause the best ; Then reason wills our hearts should be as good : Say you not, then, our offer is compell'd. Mowb. Well, by my will we shall admit no parley. West. That argues but the shame of your offence : A rotten case abides no handling. Hast. Hath the Prince John a full commission, In very ample virtue of his father, To hear and absolutely to determine Of what conditions we shall stand upon ? West. That is intended in the general's name : I muse you make so slight a question. Arch. Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule, For this contains our general grievances : Each several article herein redress'd, We come within our awful banks again, And knit our powers to the arm of peace. West. This will I show the general. Please you, lords, In sight of both our battles we may meet ; And either end in peace, \u2014 which God so frame ! \u2014 Or to the place of difference call the swords Which must decide it. Arch. My lord, we will do so. [Exit West. Mowb. There is a thing within my bosom tells me That no conditions of our peace can stand. Hast. Fear you not that : if we can make our peace Upon such large terms and so absolute As our conditions shall consist upon, Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains."], [406, "KING HENRY IV act IV 390 Mowb. Ay, but our valuation shall be such, That every slight and false-derived cause, Yea, every idle, nice, and wanton reason, Shall to the king taste of this action. Arch. No, no, my lord. Note this, \u2014 the king is weary Of dainty and such picking grievances : For he hath found, to end one doubt by death Revives two greater in the heirs of life ; And therefore will he wipe his tables clean, And keep no tell-tale to his memory, That may repeat and history his loss To new remembrance : for full well he knows He cannot so precisely weed this land As his misdoubts present occasion : His foes are so enrooted with his friends, That, plucking to unfix an enemy, He doth unfasten so and shake a friend. Hast. Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods On late offenders, that he now cloth lack The very instruments of chastisement : So that his power, like to a fangless lion, May offer, but not hold. Arch. 'Tis very true : And therefore be assur'd, my good lord marshal, If we do now make our atonement well, Our peace will, like a broken limb united, Grow stronger for the breaking. Mowb. Be it so. Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland. Re-enter Westmoreland. West. The prince is here at hand : pleaseth your lordship To meet his grace. Mowb. Your grace of York, set forward. Arch.

A\". Hen. WTiat men have you lost, Fluellen ? Flu. The perdition of th' athversary hath been very great, reasonable great : marry, for my part, I think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church, \u2014 one Bardolph, if your majesty know the man : his face is all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o' fire : and his lips plows at his nose, and it is like a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red ; but his nose is executed, and his fire's out. K. Hen. We would have all such offenders so cut off: \u2014 and we give express charge that, in our marches through the country, there be nothing compelled from the villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language ; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.

For, though I speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I am : the violet smells to him as it doth to me ; the element shows to him as it doth to me ; all his senses have but human condi tions : his ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man ; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are : yet, in reason, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army. Bates. He may show what outward courage he will : but I believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck ; \u2014 and so I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here. K. Hen. By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king : I think he would not wish himself any where but where he is. Bates. Then I would he were here alone ; so should he be sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved. K. Hen. I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here alone, howsoever you speak this, to feel other men's minds : methinks I could not die any where so contented as in the king's company, \u2014 his cause being just, and his quarrel honourable."], [462, "446 KING HENRY V ACT III Will. That's more than we know. Bates. Ay, or more than we should seek after ; for we know enough, if we know we are the king's subjects : if his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us. Will. But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join together at the latter day, and cry all, \" We died at such a place \" ; some swearing ; some crying for a surgeon ; some, upon their wives left poor behind them ; some, upon the debts they owe ; some, upon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die well that die in battle ; for how can they charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their argument ? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it ; whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjection. K. Hen. So, if a son, that is by his father sent about mer chandise, do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be imposed upon his father that sent him : or if a servant, under his master's com mand transporting a sum of money, be assailed by robbers, and die in many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the business of the master the author of the servant's damnation : \u2014 but this is not so : the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant ; for they purpose not their death, when they purpose their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers : some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder ; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury ; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have, defeated the law and outrun native punish ment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God : war is his beadle, war is his vengeance ; so that here men are punished for before -breach of the king's laws in now the king's quarrel : where they feared the death, they have borne life away ; and where they would be safe, they perish : then if they die unprovided, no more is the king"], [463, "SCENE I KING HENRY V 447 guilty of their damnation, than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited. Every subject's duty is the king's ; but every subject's soul is his own. There fore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed, \u2014 wash every mote out of his conscience : and dying so, death is to him advantage ; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained : and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think that, making God so free an offer, he let him outlive that day to see his greatness, and to teach others how they should prepare. Will. 'Tis certain, every man that dies ill,, the ill is upon his own head, \u2014 the king is not to answer it. Bates. I do not desire he should answer for me ; and yet I determine to fight lustily for him. K. Hen. I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed. Will. Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully : but when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we ne'er the wiser. K. Hen. If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after. Will.

It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom, as to speak so much more French : I shall never move thee in French, unless it be to laugh at me. Kath. Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, it est meilleur que I Anglais lequel je parle. K. Hen. No, faith, is't not, Kate : but thy speaking of my tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou understand thus much English, \u2014 Canst thou love me ? Kath. I cannot tell. K. Hen. Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate ? I'll ask them. Come, I know thou lovest me : and at night, when you come into your closet, you'll question your gentlewoman about me ; and I know, Kate, you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart : but, good Kate, mock me mercifully ; the rather, gentle princess, because I love thee cruelly. How answer you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres-chcre et divine d/esse ? Kath. Your majesty ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France. K. Hen.

But, in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear : my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer-up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face : thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst ; and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better : \u2014 and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you have me ? Put off your maiden blushes ; avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress ; take me by the hand, and say \" Harry of England, I am thine : \" which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud, \" England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry Plantagenet is thine ; \" who, though I speak it before his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the best king of good fellows. Come, your answer in broken music, \u2014 for thy voice is music, and thy English broken ; therefore, queen of all Katharines, break thy mind to me in broken English, \u2014 wilt thou have me ? Kath.

O Kate, nice customs court'sy to great kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion : we are the makers of manners, Kate ; and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find-faults, \u2014 as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss : therefore, patiently and yielding. [Kissing her.] You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate : there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French council ; and they should sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs. \u2014 Here comes your father."], [483, "SCENE I KING HENRY V 467 Re-enter the French King and Queen, Burgundy, Bedford, Gloster, Exeter, Warwick, Westmoreland, etc. Bur.
