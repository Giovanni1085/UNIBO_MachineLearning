A few pages only of this volume were in type, when its author was called away by death, from the community who esteemed and the friends who loved him.

If under such circumstances, mistakes should be found to have passed uncor rected, which the eye of the author would have discovered, \u2014 or if the information given should seem deficient on any point where the further re searches of the writer would have supplied it, the indulgence of the reader is requested. Of the Author himself, a brief notice in this place will doubtless be expected by those who are acquainted with the circumstances under which the work is published. It is hoped that before long, a more full account of his character, labors and influence will be presented to the world by one who knew him intimately, and who is in every respect eminently suited to the task. Charles James Fox was born at Antrim, N. H., in the month of October, 1811. He received his preparatory education at Dartmouth College, where he was graduated in 1S31. He pursued the study of law, at first in the law school of Yale College, and afterwards with Daniel Abbot, Esq., of Nashua (now Nashville,) N. H: With this gentleman he subsequently entered into part nership. Having been chosen in 1837 a mem ber of the State Legislature, he was appointed in connection with Judge Parker and Mr. Bell, to prepare for publication the Revised Statutes of B U"], [17, "NOTICE. V New Hampshire. The great labor which he en countered in the fulfilment of this duty, added to that of an extensive legal practice, it is believed laid the foundation of that disease which at so early a period, deprived the community of his valuable life. In 1841, Mr. Fox, in connection with Rev. Samuel Osgood, then pastor of the Unitarian Church in Nashua, prepared and published the \"New Hampshire Book,\" a collection of pieces in prose and verse, from the writings of natives and adopted citizens of this state. While a member of the Legislature, Mr. Fox took a deep interest in the establishment of the State Lunatic Asylum, of which he was ap pointed one of the Directors. On the third of June, 1840, Mr. Fox was united in marriage to Miss Catherine P. Abbot, the daughter of his partner. In the year 1S43, Mr. Fox, in consequence of his declining health, took a voyage to the Medi terranean, visiting the interesting countries which surround that sea, and extending his travels as far as Egypt. This voyage not having accomplished the res toration of his health, in the following autumn he sailed for the West Indies, accompanied by Mrs. Fox. Notwithstanding his feeble state of body, he looked on the scenes around him with"], [18, "NOTICE. VI an observant eye, and treasured up many inter esting and instructive reminiscences, which were in part given to the world after his return, in a series of letters, published in the Nashua Gazette. During this visit to the West Indies, the sub ject of slavery especially engaged his attention. He viewed it with the feelings of a philanthro pist, united with the calm judgment of a lawyer; and had his health permitted him to complete his first design in the letters above referred to, his testimony on this subject would have possessed a peculiar value. Enough however is contained in the letters which he was able to write and publish, to show his deep and enlightened inter est in whatever concerned the rights and the welfare of his fellow beings. J From this journey he returned in a state of great feebleness, in June, 1845. During the suc ceeding fall and winter, he gradually sunk, though with intervals of apparent improvement, until his death, which took place February 17th. 1846. Industrious to the last, the hours when such exertion was possible, were devoted to the revision of the History which is now presented to the public, and to poetical compositions, chief ly on religious subjects. The character of Mr. Fox had always, it is believed, been marked by purity and upright ness. As early as 183S, he became a member of"], [19, "NOTICE. VII the Unitarian Church in Nashua ; he was an ef ficient teacher in the Sunday School, and a firm supporter of religious institutions and enterpri ses, until sickness compelled him to retire from public action. His views in the anticipation of death were calm ; he seemed to be without fear, and to rest on the assurances of his Heavenly Father's love. Only when he spoke of the great ness of the blessings which that love had provid ed, did his voice falter, and his dying words seem too weak to express his overflowing gratitude. With such ties to life as few possess, beloved and honored by the community, dear to the Church of Christ, and cherished as a son, a husband and a father, he surrendered himself with calm faith to the will of his Creator.

The following work was undertaken in consequence of a vole passed at the Annual Meeting of the New Hampshire Historical Society, June, 1840, appointing the Author Chairman of the Committee upon Histories of Towns. It was remarked that great deficiencies existed, and that materials should be speedily collected while so many of ihe immediate descendants of the first settlers were yet living. Attention was thus turned to the subject: \u2014 an examination of ancient records made and a collection of materials commenced, and the result is the compilation which is now submit ted to the public. ft would be inconvenient and burdensome to cite the authority for every statement that is made, but the reader may be assured that no fact is stated as such without what is deemed to be good authority. The value of a work like this depends in a great mea sure upon the accuracy of its details, and to this the writer confi dently lays claim. A large portion is extracted from the Town and Proprietary Records of Dunstable, which are in a good state of pre servation, excepting a few years between 1694 and 1710. Much has been derived from the Town, Military, Ecclesiastical, Pecuni ary, and Legislative Records of the Commonwealth of Massachu setts, prior to 1741, in the office of the Secretary of State, at Bos ton. For many accommodations in examining and copying the Records I am indebted to Rev. Joseph B. Felt, who has been em ployed for many years by the State in arranging and binding them. The materials for minute and accurate history there collected and arranged by Mr. Felt, are very curious and valuable. A similar collection of papers, belonging to a period subsequent to 1741, and including the French and Revolutionary wars, is found in the office of the Secretary of this State, at Concord, to which free access has been granted. Frequent reference has also been had to the American, Massa chusetts, and New Hampshire Historical Societies; to Farmer's"], [30, "4 PREFACE. and Moore's Historical Collections, Farmer's Notes to Bellcnap's New Hampshire; to the various Indian publications of Mr. Sam uel E. Drake, the N. H. Gazetteer, and to all the Town and State Histories from which any thing could be gleaned. For much in formation we are indebted to the old inhabitants of the Town, and to the descendants of the early settlers. Much time and labor have been devoted to the work. It may not be of general interest, but it is hoped that its object will be appre ciated by those for whom especially it was designed. The Histo ry of the settlement and growth of our Towns is deservedly attract ing increased attention. As our old men pass away, and records are destroyed, and traditions forgotten, these collections thus pre served from destruction, humble and useless though they may ap pear to some, will become more and more valuable. Desirous of doing what he may for the home of his adoption, and fondly believ ing that the subject will be intrinsically interesting to every inhab itant of \" Old Dunstable,\" this work has been prepared and is submitted by the Author. Since the above was written, (1841,) five years have elapsed, and the work is unpublished, partly owing to the pressure of other la bors, and partly to severe and long protracted sickness. An inter val of comparative ease and the request of friends have now induced its preparation for the press, and it is offered to the indulgence of the public. It has been revised, enlarged and brought down to the present time. An effort has been made to obtain full and accurate statistics of the condition of the Village, but under the circumstan ces, errors, omissions and imperfections must occur. For these charity is craved. That this and some other portions of the work will not be so in teresting to the general reader as the more romantic incidents is very evident, but there are few local Histories that contain so many of the latter as the present. Besides, the former are absolutely ne cessary to the complete history of a town, especially of d manufac turing town. To the kindness of friends the Author is so greatly indebted for assistance in such various forms, that he will only say, God bless them all !"], [31, "INTRODUCTION. It was a remark of Edmund Burke, no super ficial observer, that \" they who never look back to their ancestors, will never look forward to pos terity.\" There is great truth and beauty in the remark. Those who \" build the tombs of the prophets,\" do not always, indeed, heed their pre cepts or follow their example, but those who care nothing for the past, its actors or its story, will care little for the welfare of the future. It is na tural and commendable to care for those who have gone before us. \" They have labored, and we have entered into their labors.\" The men who settled this region, and \" hewed the ancient woods away,\" were such as the world had rarely seen. They were ready to do all, and dare all, and suffer all for the sake of conscience. They \"called no man master,\" and the germ of free dom which they planted in the wilderness, be came the noble \"Liberty Tree\" of the Revolution."], [32, "6 INTRODUCTION. Of such descent we may well be proud. We wish to know who they were, and when, and where, and how they lived. Their toils and pri vations and sufferings, their opinions and pecu liarities to us should be important. From them is derived all that is peculiar to the New Eng land character; its energy, its ingenuity, its per severance, and its hatred of tyranny in all its forms and manifestations. An insight into their every day life would be most valuable, but they have passed away, and the story of the first set tlers of D unstable, with its startling romance and stern realities, has nearly perished with them. A fe\u00bbw materials yet exist, scattered and imperfect. in cotemporary journals and musty records, in ancient burial grounds or in uncertain traditions, only to be gathered with great labor and anti quarian zeal and patience. These perishing me morials have been sought out and embodied with filial regard, by one who is proud of a descent from the first settlers, trusting that the simple story of Indian perils and Revolutionary patriot ism, of toil and perseverance, of enterprise and success will not prove entirely destitute of inter est or of instruction."], [33, "CHAPTER I. THE FIRST SETTLERS OF DUNSTABLE. The landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth in December, 1620, is an epoch in the world's his tory. \"On this bleak New England shore,\" in the wilderness, with the snows of winter around them and a few wretched dwellings to protect them, and wild beasts and wilder men, they es tablished a Colony which is destined to solve a problem for the human race. Its motto and its basis was \"freedom to worship God.\" Perse cuted in the old world alike by Catholic and Epis copalian for opinion's sake, driven from their homes, they came to this \" wilderness world \" with gladsome hearts, \" singing the songs of Zi on,\" even in this \" strange land,\" for that \"here they could worship God according to the dictates of their consciences in peace.\" The Plymouth settlers were but pioneers, and soon crowds flocked hither, ready to dare all and to endure all for the priceless boon of a free con science and free speech. Boston, Salem, Ports mouth and Dover were settled, and every where, with each little band of brethren, the \" man of God\" went forth to cheer them in toil, in peril, and in death. As the fame of this new asylum for the oppressed began to spread abroad more widely, greater crowds of emigrants came, until the older settlements became too populous. Ad-"], [34, "8 HISTORY OF venturous spirits went forth into the wilderness upon every side to found new plantations, and at a very early period, not long after the settlement of Boston, attention was turned towards the val leys of the Merrimac and the Nashua. In Au gust, 1652, (1) the valley of the Merrimac as far northward as the outlet of Lake Winnipisiogee, was surveyed by Capt. Simon Willard and Capt. Edward Johnson, and its rich basins and valua ble fishing stations were laid open to to the eager gaze of the adventurers. The valleys of the Merrimac and Nashua are of alluvial formation. That they have undergone great changes is very evident. Their general ap pearance, the shape of their basins, their outlets, their different levels, and the stratified character of the soil, all show that at some remote period the greater portion of these valleys must have been covered with water in the form of Lakes or large Ponds. Geologists find the same character istics upon all our Rivers, and some even refer their origin to the Deluge. But whenever and however their origin may have been, it is evident that the valley of the Merrimac was once a suc cession of Lakes, one ending at Pawtucket Falls. and another at Amoskeag Falls, through whose rocky basins the waters at length burst their way, and formed their present lower channel, leaving their former beds dry. (1 ) This survey was made by order of the Genera] Assembly of Massachusetts to determine the Northerly bound of the Colony, \"and an inscription was made upon a large stone in Winnipisiogee River, at a point \" three miles North of the head of Merrimac River,\" to designate the spot. The Colony of Massachusetts then claimed all the land lying \" three miles \" North and East of the Merrimac from its mouth to this point, and thence due West lo New York. This stone was discovered a few years since, and gave rise to many con jectures as to its origin. For an account of it, see 4 N. H. Histori cal Collections, 194."], [35, "9 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, &C. The same is equally true of the valley of the Nashua, one outlet being at Mine Falls, and another at the high bluff near the Nashua Cor poration, through which the river has forced a passage, and left large basins exposed for cultivation. In corroboration of this theory we know that logs have often been found here, buried in the earth at a great depth. When the excava tion for the foundation of the Locks near the Mer rimac was being made in 1825, at a spot about one hundred feet from the River, and at a depth of many feet below the surface, the workmen found several logs, a quantity of charcoal, as if the remains of a fire, and a toad, which, on being exposed to the sun and air, revived and hopped away. Such discoveries are not of unfrequent occurrence, but as to the time and mode of their deposit we are left only to theory and conjecture. The valley of the Merrimac was not an object of desire to the English alone. From the earliest periods it seems to have been looked upon by the Indian as almost a Paradise. The Winnipisio gee, or \" the very pleasant place where there is but little land,\" was deeply beloved. (1.) The Merrimac with its numerous Naamkeeks, or fish ing stations, and its rich planting fields for maize, was still more dear. So far, indeed, had its fame extended, that in 1604, years before the Landing at Plymouth, a French Jesuit, writing from Can ada to France, could say : \" The Indians tell us of a beautiful River lying far to the South, which they call Merrimac.\" (2.) (1.) The Indians are also said to have called it, \" The smile of the Great Spirit.\" The name is Winni-peesi-okhe, and should be pronounced Win-ni-pis-saw'-key, with the accent on the last syllable nut one. (2.) Sieur De Monts. Relations of the Jesuits, 1604. Merrimac means Sturgeon. There is also a Merrimac which flows into the Missouri river."], [36, "10 HISTORY OF The Indians who inhabited the more souther- ly portions of the valley were of a mild disposi- tion, and invited intercourse with the whites. In 1655 the settlements had extended as far North as Chelmsford and Groton. From 1655 to 1665 was a period of unwonted activity and prosperi- ty. There was peace with the Indians, and the tide of population rolled onwards rapidly. The Indians had planting fields all along the valleys of the Merrimac, the Souhegan, and the Nashua, and these were objects of eager desire to the settler. About 1655, grants of land in this vicin- ity were made to those who belonged to the ex- ploring company of Johnson and Willard. In 1656 the lands upon both sides of the Merrimac, extending on the west side from Naticook brook (1) to a line about a mile south of Peni chuck brook, and including the greater part of Litchfield, were granted to William Brenton, and called \" Brenton's Farm. \"(2.) Nearly all the in terval lands about Naticook were granted not long after. In 1659 and 1660 large tracts of land were granted upon the Souhegan river, (3.) ata place called by the Indians Quohquinna-pashessan anagnog, being the meadows in Amherst which lie at the mouth of the small brook, which, aris ing in Mont Vernon, and flowing around the plain in Amherst, runs into the Souhegan in the South part of the town. Five hundred acres were grant ed to Capt. William Davis of Boston and Capt. (I.) Naticook is the little brook just above Thornton's Ferry, in Merrimac. (2.)

About the same time a grant of 400 acres, ly ing at the mouth of Salmon Brook, was made to John Whiting. It was bounded on the north \"by the upland,\" and extended up the brook about a mile and a half, embracing the souther ly part of Nashua Village. Several hundred acres, also, were granted atPenichuck Pond, and so down Penichuck Brook, in Merrimac and Nashville. About 1662, 500 acres upon the easterly side of the Merrimac, in Litchfield, \"atNacook,\" were granted to the town of Billerica for a \"School Farm,\" and 300 acres adjoining, to \"Phinehas Pratt and others for straights aud hardships en dured by them in planting at Plymouth of which he was one.\" (3.) Four hundred acres were granted to Gov.

At this late day it is extremely difficult to define its boundaries accurately, but by a perambulation of lines made in 1734, an approximation may be made. The north eastern corner was a very large and high rock now standing about three miles north easterly of the mouth of Souhegan River in Londonderry. The south east corner was \" at the corner of Melhuen and Dracut,\" \"in sight of Beaver Brook.\" The north west cor ner was at \"dram cup hill\" on the Souhegan, in the westerly part of Milford, and the westerly line which ran \" due South\" passed \"near the west end of Muscatanapus Pond,\" in Brook line (1.) It extended ten or twelve miles west of Merrimac River, and from three to five miles east of it. and its average length north and south was from twelve to fourteen miles. The present Township of Nashua and Nashville oc cupies very nearly the centre of the original Township. In 1674, because there was \"very little medo left except what is already granted to the ffarmes,\" the easterly line of the township was extended to Beaver Brook, by an additional grant from the General Court, and the Town was called Dun stable. It received its name in compliment to Mrs. Mary Tyng, wife of Hon. Edward Tyng, (1.)

Among the original Proprietors we find the names of many of the leading men in the Colony, some of whom, with the children and friends of others, removed here and took up their abode at an early period. Of this number we find Gov. Dudley, who married a daughter of Hon. Ed ward Tyng of this town, Rev. Thomas Weld, who was the first minister, and married another daughter, Thomas Brattle, Pete'r Bulkely, Heze kiah Usher, Elisha Hutchinson, Francis Cook, and others who were Assistants and Magistrates. Many of the first settlers belonged to Boston and its vicinity, a circumstance which gave strength and influence to the infant plantation. At what time and by whom Dunstable was first settled is uncertain, but it must have been considerably earlier than the date of the charter in 1673. In the Charter farms are mentioned as then existing, and some of \" the farmers \" were among the Petitioners. Of this number were Scarlett, Wheeler, and others. In 1675, orchards are mentioned as then in existence, which must have been the. growth of years. In 1674, \" the house of Lt. Wheeler\" is designated as a place of holding a meeting of the Proprietors, and we have some reason to suppose that he may have been the earliest settler. (1.) Wheeler and Bren ton were fur traders among the Indians. In 1657, the trade with the Indians was regulated by the General Court, and the exclusive right of this trade upon Merrimac river was sold to \"Maj. (I.) Lt.

For the purpose of trafficking with the Indians more conveniently, it was customary to establish trading houses beyond the settlements, and at places to which they could easily resort. It is not impossible that Wheeler may have resided here for such a purpose, at an early date after his grant, as Henchman resided a little farther south in Chelmsford. About 1665, John Cromwell, an Indian trader also, resided at Tyngsborough, but soon after removed to Merrimac, where he built a trading house, about two miles above the mouth of Penichuck brook, at the falls which now bear his name. (2.) According to the custom of the time, it is said that he used his foot as a pound weight in the purchase of furs, until the Indians, beginning to suspect him of cheating them, drove him away and burned his house, the cellar of which still is or was recently visible. It is stat ed by Farmer, (3.) whose authority is unques tionable, that '\u25a0 the ancient settlement''' was with in the limits of Nashua, and as grants of land here were made in 1659, and farms existed here be fore 1673, and as Chelmsford was settled in 1655, we may reasonably conclude that some, who stood \"in great need of accommodations,\" found their way to the rich intervals upon our rivers, at a period not much later than the date of the grants.

The Plague, which swept off' the Indian tribes in and around Plymouth and Piscataqua, in 1612 and 1613, prepared the way for the coining of the forefath ers, and similar providential events occurred as population moved westward. The valleys of the Merrimac and the Nashua were inhabited by numerous small tribes, or branches of tribes of Indians, who lived in villages containing one hun dred or two hundred souls, and subsisted chiefly by fishing and hunting. The Nashaways had their head quarters at Lancaster; the Nashobas at Littleton ; the Pawtuckets at Pawtucket Falls; the Wamesits at Wamesit Falls, at the mouth of Concord river ; the Naticooks in this vicinity; and the' Penacooks around Penacook, now Con cord, N. H. They were all, however, subject to Passaconoway. The Mohawks, or Maquas, a fierce and savage tribe from New York, were the hereditary enemies of them all. The Indian tribes which dwelt nearest to the English settle ments, and especially the Pawtuckets and Wam esits, from their weakness, and their fears both of the Mohawks and the English, craved the friendship and protection of the latter. They served as guides and sentinels for the exposed frontiers, and were often of great service. The Penacooks, however, were a more bold, warlike, and dangerous race, who refused all attempts to christianize them, although their dread of the English was generally sufficient to keep them from open hostility. In the spring of 1669, a portion of the Pena cooks, fearing an attack from the Mohawks, mov ed down the Merrimac to the Pawtucket, and built a fort there for their protection. Their"], [48, "20 HISTORY' OF neighborhood was a cause of alarm to the set tlers, some of whom shut themselves up in garri sons; but in the succeeding autumn they joined in an expedition against the Mohawks, by whom they were overpowered, and almost entirely de stroyed.

The greater part of the Indians in this vicinity, especially the more turbulent and dangerous to the number of six or seven hundred, united in this expedition, and nearly the whole of them perished, with more than fifty chiefs. The remnant, dispirited and powerless, united with the Wamesits, and became \"praying In dians.\" At this time, Passaconaway (2.) was sachem of the Penacooks and held rule over all the Indi ans from the Piscataqua to the Connecticut, and all down the Merrimac. He resided at Penacook, and the Naticooks, Pawtuckets and Wamesits were subject to his power. He had been a great warrior, and was the greatest and \" most noted powow and sorcerer of all the country.\" (3.) He died before 1670, at the great age of one hundred and twenty. \" In 1660, not long before his death, at a great feast and dance, he made his farewell speech to his people. In this he urged them, as a dying man, to take heed how they quarrelled with their English neighbors, for though they might do them some harm, yet it would prove the means of their own destruction.

Thus providen tially was all this region freed from hostile Indi ans, and the way opened for the coming of our fathers in comparative safety. The valleys of the Naticook, of Salmon brook and the Nashua, (or Watananock as it is called in the Court Records,) especially near their mouths, were favorite resorts and abodes of the Indians. There, memorials of their residence have often been discovered. Such spots, com bining a rich and easily wrought alluvial soil with productive fisheries, were always chosen ; and the choice was a wise aud beautiful one. The Indian was the child of Nature, and gazed upon her charms with filial admiration. With a true sense of the sublime, to him \" the mountains were God's altars,\" and he looked up to their cloud-capped summits with deep awe, as the dwelling place of \" the Great Spirit.\" With a sense of the beautiful equally true, their homes were grouped together in some shel tered valley, girt round with hills, and woods, and water falls; or by the border of some quiet lake, or upon the rich alluvium of the river: but whether for convenience or beauty, they were ev er by the water-side. And truly, when these spots were covered with the grand old woods, their primal veslure, when the white man's steps had not yet profaned the solitude, kw scenes could have been found more lovely than the val leys of the Merrimac, of Salmon brook, and the Nashua. The Chiefs who dwelt in those valleys did not generally live in a style of much greater utagni fi-"], [51, "NASHUA, NASHVILLE, &C 23 cence than their subjects, though they enjoyed greater abundance. Their confederacy was a great democracy, where danger, conflict and toil and privation were shared alike by all, the lead er, being distinguished only by greater exertions and braver daring. But on great occasions they exhibit-ed a rude splendor and prolusion befitting the dignity of the tribe and its rulers, Sachems, and to which all contributed. Whittier, in his \"Bridal of Penacook,\" has given us a graphic picture of a wedding and dance given by Passa conaway on the marriage of his daughter, Weta moo, to Winnepnrkit, Sachem of Saugus, Maine. He has most beautifully and happily introduced the sweet and flowing Indian names, (how bar barous the taste which substituted most of our modern ones !) which abound along the Merrimac and its tributaries, and the whole scene is de lightful as a specimen of Indian domestic life.

The earliest compact settlements were made near the mouth of Salmon brook, between its mouth and the main road, and so down the Merrimac, upon the spots deserted by the Indians. The land which lay between Salmon brook and the Merrimac was called \" The Neck,\" and for greater security the \" housne-lotts \" (house lots) of the first settlers were laid out adjoining each other, and \" within the neck.\" The lots which lay nearest Salmon brook ran from Salmon brook to the Merrimac, and were generally from thirty to forty rods iu width upon each stream. After the first six or eight lots, the west line of the lots ivas bounded upon \" Long Hill.\" In the rear of the school house in the Harbor district in Nashua, and the north and east edges of the Mill Pond, several cellar holes are still visible, and within a {ew years an ancient well was open. Apple trees are there standing, hollow, splintered, covered with moss and almost entirely decayed, bearing marks of very great antiquity. The ear ly settlers came from the south eastern part of England, where cider and perry were manufac tured in great quantities, and they brought with them the same tastes and habits. Orchards are spoken of in our town records as early as 1675, and these shattered relics of an age that is past may possibly have been the original stock, or at least their immediate descendants. About fifty rods north east of the school house, near a small cluster of oaks, stood the \"Old Fort,\" or garrison, in which the inhabitants dwelt in seasons of imminent danger, and to"], [54, "I 26 HISTORY' OF ! which they often retired at night. There was a' ' well in the fort which was open until within a few years.

The field adjoining was owned by Perry, 1 and is still known as the '' Perry Field.\" After the Charter was obtained in 1673, the inhabitants increased rapidly. The proprietors made liberal grants to actual settlers, and upon the following conditions, which have been select ed from their articles of agreement drawn up Oct. 15, 1673. \"Every one yt (I.) is received (as an inhabitant,) shall have 10 acres for his person, and one acre more added thereto for every \u00a320 estate, and nono shall have above 30 acres in yr house lotts, nor none under 30 acres, and yt all after divisions of land shall be proportioned according to their home lotts, and so shall all yr public charges be, both as to church and town. \"All ye inhabitants yt are received- into this town shall make improvements of ye lotts yt they take np, by build- ing upon them, by fencing and by breaking up land, by the time prefixed by the Geneial Court, wh. is by Oct. 1G7G, and they shall live, each inhabitant upon his own loir, or else put such inhabitant upon it as the town accepts. \" To the intent yt we may live in love and peace togeth- er we do agree, yt whatever fence we do make, either about cornfields, orchards or gardens, shall be a sufficient four rail fence, or yt which is equivalent, whether hedge, ditch, or stone wall, or of loggs, and if any person sustain damage through the deficiency of their own fences not I being according to order, he shall beat his own damage.

THE INDIAN WAU OF 1675. In the summer of 1675 the war with Philip. the powerful and wily Sachem of the Wampano ags, commenced, wliich involved nearly all the Indians in New England. It was not without a bitter struggle that the red men left their pleas ant valleys, where they had roamed in child hood, and where the bones of their fathers rested. Township after township had been occupied by the white men, and they had been crowded from their ancient hunting fields and fishing stations. At lenglh they were surrounded by settlements, and mutual aggressions and heart-burnings en sued. The red man and the white man could not longer live together, and the annihilation of one party or the other seemed the only alterna tive. The Indians combined for a war of exter mination, and all throughout New England were burning and massacre and devastation. Lan caster, Groton and Chelmsford were destroyed, and hundreds killed or carried into captivity. At such a period, with a war of extermination raging all around them, the settlers of Dunstable were indeed in a perilous situation. Scarcely as yet were the forests cleared away, and their dwel lings erected. Even their meeting-house was not yet finished.

This created new suspicion and alarm among the settlers, and nearly all of them de serted the town, although companies of scouts were constantly traversing the wilderness for the protection of the frontiers. The winter of 1675 was a time of fear and of trial. Never had \"the Indian enemy\" been more active or dreaded. Even the \" Christian Indians \" had communications with their hostile brethren, and the whiles began to suspect them of treachery.

Where his feet have trodden and his prayers ascended, we may \"call it holy ground.\" The treatment of the Indians by our forefa thers generally, and of Wannalancet especially, was not Christian, and scarcely humane. They were ordered to move and remove at their will, imprisoned on the most unfounded suspicions, their hunting fields taken away, their fishing pla ces and corn-fields encroached on with impunity, yet Wannalancet remained friendly to the end.

This was a meeting of the proprietors as well as of the settlers, and was holden at Woburn, at which place the meetings for the choice of own officers were held for many years, and occasionally as late as 1711. The record is as follows: (2.) \" Nov. 28, 1677. At a Town meeting held at Woburn. \"Capt. Thomas Brattle, Capt. (Elisha) Hutchinson, Capt.

They intended, nevertheless, to build at once, for it was \" left with Mr. Jonathan Tyng, Capt. Parker and Abra ham Parker to agree with John Lollendine, (who was the first house and mill wright in town,) to secure and finish said house,\" which had been commenced before the desertion of the settlement in 1675. Several persons were also \" admitted as inhab itants,\" and it was voted \"yt the selectmen have power to add other inhabitants, provided that with the present they exceed not the number of eighty families.\" \"Before the Revolution of 1689, no person could vote or be elected \"to any office until he had been admitted a Freeman of the Commonwealth. This might be done by the General Assembly or the County Court, but only upon evidence of his be ing a member in good standing of some Congre gational Church. Before voting every person was required to take \"the Freeman's Oath.\" This meeting house was finished in 1678, and was probably built of logs. The precise spot where it stood is not known, but probably it was not far distant from the settlement at Salmon brook. As the settlement increased a new meet-"], [68, "40 HISTOKY OF ing house was erected near the old Burying Ground in the south part of Nashua. In the Journal of a scout in 1724, it is said to have stood about nine miles distant from Penichook pond. No other church, except those which suc ceeded this upon the same spot, was erected in the southern part of !Sew Hampshire for more than forty years, and its minister, like another John the Baptist, was \" the voice of one crying in the wilderness.\" April 22, 1679, William Tyng, son of Jonathan Tyng, was born in this town. This is the first birth which is found upon the records of the town. April, 1680, Sarah, daughter of John Lollendine, was born. It is probable that other births occur red at a much earlier date, since it is known that there were many inhabitants for years previous, and in 1680 \" 30 families were settled there and a learned orthodox minister ordained among them.\"(l.) Before 1679, a lot of land upon Salmon brook was granted by the town, and known as \"the mill lot,\" and a saw mill erected. Where it stood is not known, but it is not improbable that it was on the spot where the \"Webb Mill,\" near the house of J. Bowers, Esq., now\" stands, since it is known that a mill stood there at a very early pe riod, and it would probably be located as near the settlement as possible. There was originally a beaver dam at that place, and it required but little labor to prepare the site for the mill. Many years ago a mill crank was dug up near the spot. which must have come from its ruins. As early as May 1, 1679, and perhaps before that time, Rev. Thomas Weld was employed here (I.) Petition in 2 Prcmince Papers\u2014 Towns\u2014 2iZ, in office of N. H. Secretary of State."], [69, "NASHUA, NASHVILLE, &C 41 as a minister. In the settlement of New Eng- land, religion was at the very foundation. The means of religious instruction ever kept pace with the spread of population, and \" he who counted Religion as twelve, and the world as thirteen, had not the spirit of a true New England man. \"(I.) In the very charter, therefore, it was provided by the General Court, that the grantees were to \" procure and maintain an able and orthodox minister amongst them,\" and to build a meeting house \" within three years.\" This condition could not be complied with on account of Philip's War, which compelled them to desert the settle- ment, yet, as we have seen, at the first town meeting which was holden after its resettlement, the first vote was for the choice of Selectmen, and the next a provision for the ministry and a place for public worship, the Selectmen just chosen be- ing appointed agents to carry the vote into effect. A \" thirty acre right\" as it was called, entitling the owner to about six hundred acres on the sub- sequent divisions of the common lands, was grant- ed fora \" ministerial lot,\" as a farther encourage- ment to the ministry. Upon this Mr. Weld re- sided, and it is probably a part of the Fletcher farm now owned by John Little. As an illustration of the character and man- ners of the early inhabitants of the town, the laws of the Colony at this period, as an exponent of public opinion, form perhaps the best criterion. In 1651, \" dancing at weddings \" was forbidden, and in 1660, \" William Walker was imprisoned a month for courting a maid without the leave of her parents.\" In 1675, because \" there is mani fest pride appearing in our streets,\"' the wearing of \" long hair or periwigs,\" and also \" supersti- tious ribands,\" used to tie up and decorate the (l.) Higginson's Election Sermon, 1C63."], [70, "42 HISTORY OF hair, were forbidden under severe penalties. \u2014 Men, too, were forbidden to \" keej7 Christmas\" because it was a Popish custom. In 1677 an act was passed to prevent \" the profaneness\" of \" turning the back upon the public worship before it is finished, and the blessing pronounced.\" \u2014 Towns were directed to erect \" a cage \" near the meeting house, and in this all offenders against the sanctity of the Sabbath were confined. At the same time children were directed to be placed in a particular part of the meeting house, apart by themselves, and Tythingmen were or dered to be chosen, whose duty it should be to take care of them. So strict were they in their observance of the Sabbath, that \" John Ather ten \"(1.) a soldier of Col. Tyng's company, was fined by him \"forty shillings\" for \"wetting a piece of an old hat to put into his shoes,\" which chafed his feet upon the march, and those who neglected to attend meeting for three months were publicly whipped. Even fn Harvard College stu dents were whipped for grave offences in the chapel, in presence of students and Professors, and prayers were had before and after the inflic tion of the punishment. As the settlers of Dim stable are described in the Petition as \"of sober and orderly conversation.\" we may suppose that these laws and customs were rigidly observed. W e ought not to wonder at the seeming auster ity of the Puritans : still less should we blame or ridicule, for to them does New England owe her peculiar elevation and privileges. Scouted at by the licentious courtiers, whether Episcopalian or Catholic, for their strictness and formality, nick named \"Crop-ears,\" ridiculed for their poverty and want of education, they naturally clung te naciously to those peculiarities for which they (1.) He was of Lancaster, Mass."], [71, "43 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, &C had suffered, and prized them most dearly. As naturally did they dislike all which savored of the offensive worship or customs of their persecu tors, and strive sedulously to differ from them. They would have no proud \" Churches,\" for \" the Church of Christ is a living Temple,\" so in their plain, unsteepled, barn-like \"Meeting- Houses\" they worshipped God with a prouder humility. The Establishment was the mystic \" Babylon,\" and all its forms, rituals and tastes of course anti-Christian. No band or surplice added dignity to the minister, for he was but the equal, nay, the servant of all. Long hair or a wig was an abomination, and a crime against all laws human and divine. No sound of bells sum moned them to worship, and no organ listed their prayers and praises to Heaven upon the wings of music. They placed no shrub or flower over the graves of the dead, but instead the plain slab with quaint carving of death's head, or cross bones, or hourglass, and solemn inscription. All orna ment was a vain show, and beauty a Delilah. They believed their wilderness homes to be \"the New Jerusalem,\" and, taking the Bible as their standard, labored in all things outwardly and inwardly to be \" a peculiar people.\" And they were so. They did really believe in God and religion, and they strove to practice what they believed at any sacrifice. The world has seen few such men, and it will be well for New England if she forget not the principle, the real, living Faith, which inspired and exalted the Pu ritans. No records exist of any meeting from Novem ber 1677, to April 1680, when Joseph Cummings, Jr., was chosen a Selectman in the place of Cap tain Hutchinson ; Joseph Parker, Jr., Constable ; \"Capt. Parker, Robert Paris, Joseph Parker and"], [72, "44 HISTORY of John Lollendine a committee to assign lotts.\" At a subsequent meeting they also \" chose these men to run the line between Groton and us.\" In the Spring of this year lands were improved upon the north side of the Nashua. June 14, 1681, \"Jona. Blansher [Blanchard] and Thomas Lun [Lund] were chose fence sew- ers [viewers,] and an order was passed command- ing all persons \" to take care of & yook yr. hogs on penilty of paing double damiges.\" In November 1680, a great comet appeared, at which, says Holmes, \" the people were greatly surprised and terrified.\"(l.) It continued to be visible until February, 1681, and was \" the lar- gest that had ever been seen.\" So great and gen- eral was the alarm excited, that a \"general fast\" was appointed by the Governor and Coun- cil, and one reason assigned in the proclamation was, \" that awful, portentous, blazing star, usu- ally foreboding some calamity to the beholders thereof.\" This fast was observed with great strictness. We may smile at the ignorant and superstitious terror of even the dignitaries and wise men of the land in those days, but our smile must be checked a little when we remember the alarm excited in 1833, in our own community by a similar cause. Dec. 28, 1681, died Hon. Edward Tyng, aged 81. Where he settled is unknown, but probably not far from the \" Haunted House,\" so called, in Tyngsborough. He was born in Dunstable in England, in 1600, settled in Boston as a mer chant, 1639, was Representative 1661 and 1662. Assistant from 1668 to 1681, and Colonel of the Suffolk Regiment.

In 1682, the inhabitants seem to have increased considerably, and the settlement to have acquired a firm footing. The records assume a new form, and become more numerous and town-like. \u2014 \" Capt. Brattle, Capt. Parker, Mr. Tinge, Sar geant John Cummings, and Robert Parris were chose Selectmen.\" Provision was made for the collection of taxes, by ordering that the allotments of such as neglect or refuse to pay their taxes, should \" be sould at an outcry on the next public meeting day after such neglect or refus.\" Even at this early day there were some, to whom \" re ligion was as twelve and the world as thirteen,\" or even more. Trespasses were committed upon the common lands, and the town found it necessa ry to order that \"every man that felleth any wood or tre in the comon shall pay fiv shillings for such offence.\" The cattle, also, seem to have become equally unruly, for it was found necessa ry to heighten their fences to a \" saffisient five raile or equivalent.\" (i?slF\\irmeris~Cre^a!ogical Register, to which I am largely in debted in this way."], [74, "46 HISTORY OF May 8, 1682, \" at a selectmen's meeting, it was ordered that the hogs of Dunstable of three months ould and upward, be soficiently yoked and rung at or before the twentieth of the present month, and John Ackers be appointed and Imployed to pound, youke and Ringe such hogs; and for so do ing it is ordered that the owner of every such hog shal pay to the said Swinyard twelv penc, and John Acres is appointed hoge constable to se this order exsicuted.\" So early was the necessity for this ancient and respectable office recognized by our wise forefathers, and the trust committed to one who was qualified to \" exsicote\" it. August 28, 1682, \" Mine Islands\" were laid out to Hezekiah Usher. (1.) The islands at the foot of \"Mine Falls\" had acquired this name already, on account of mines which were sup posed to exist there. The rumor was that they had been long worked by the Indians, who ob tained from them their supply of lead.

Up to this period Mr. Weld had been preaching here but had never been ordained. In 1684, how ever, a new meeting house was erected, and hav ing consented to settle, he was ordained, Decem ber 16, 1685. At the same time a church was formed, consisting of seven male members, viz. Jonathan Tyng, John Cummings, senior, John Blanchard, Cornelius Waldo, Samuel Warner, Obadiah Perry, and Samuel French. John Blanchard and Cornelius Waldo were chosen the first Deacons. The following is the Covenant which was adopted in the neighboring churches at that pe riod, and which undoubtedly was adopted here. It is substantially the same as that which was framed for the First Church in Salem, by the associated Churches of the Colony, in 1629, and promulgated by the General Assembly in 1680, for the use of the Colony.

In 1686 the Indians at Wamesit and Naticook sold all the lands within the limits of Dunstable to Jonathan Tyng and others, together with all their possessions in this neighborhood, and nearly all of them removed from the vicinity. (2.) How much was paid for this purchase of Dunstable, or rather release of their claims, is unknown, but probably about \u00a320, as we find that this sum was assessed upon the proprietors soon after, for the purpose of \" paying for lands bought of the In dians.\"^.) In 1687 the town raised =\u00a31 12s. 2d. towards our proportion of the expense of \"building the great bridge \" over the Concord river in Billerica.

The choice is recorded with all gravity, among other dignitaries of the town, and the office was doubtless in those days a serious and real one, and no sinecure, unless we suspect our grave forefathers of a practical joke. In 1688 occurred the revolution in England which in December drove James II. from the throne and kingdom, and abolished forever the Catholic supremacy in that country. It was fol lowed immediately by a revolution in New Eng land. Sir Edmund Andros, the royal Governor, who had become exceedingly unpopular by his arbitrary measures, was deposed, and a popular government instituted upon the basis of the an cient charters. This was done even before the news of the revolution in England had reached Boston. The different towns in the colony were invited to choose delegates to meet in convention at Bos ton, and assume the government. This conven tion met accordingly in May, 1689, almost every town being represented. Dunstable was among the number. In May, 1689, John Waldo was a delegate from this town; in June, 1689, Corne lius Waldo; and in December, 1689, RobertPar ris.(2.) This was a popular assertion of \" ina lienable rights,\" and a foreboding and precedent of the revolution of 1776.

Tn 1689, the war with the French, known as King Wil liam's War, broke out between France and Eng land. It was occasioned by the Revolution, of which we have just spoken, (the French taking up arms for King James,) and lasted until 1698. (1.) The French excited, by means of the Jesuits, nearly all the Indian tribes to arm against the English, and the history of the fron tier during this period, the darkest and bloodiest in our annals, is but a succession of devastations and massacres. In these bloody scenes the Pen acooks were not idle. Almost every settlement upon the frontiers was attacked, some of them repeatedly; and several hundred men, women and children were either killed or carried into captiv ity. The war was commenced by an attack upon Dover, June 28, 1689, in which Major Waldron and more than fifty others were killed or taken prisoners. (2.) It was a perfect surprise, as no warning of hostility had been given. An attack upon Dunstable, by the same party and at the same time, was plotted, but it was providentially discovered by two friendly Indians, who inform ed Major Henchman, the commander of the fort at Pawtncket falls, of their intention. He arous ed the settlement at once to a sense of their immi nent danger, by the fearful news; \"Julimatt fears that his chief will quickly be done at Dun stable.\" (3.) \" Quickly !\" How little do we appreciate the startling import of such a message !

The inhabitants retired to the garrisons which were fortified, and preparations for defence were made. A messenger was also despatched to warn Major Waldron of his danger, but he was detain ed on the way and did not arrive until after the massacre. In consequence of this news, the Assembly ordered two parties of mounted troopers, consist ing of twenty men each, to Dunstable and Lan caster, \" for the relief and succor of those places, and to scout about the heads of those towns and other places adjacent, to discover the enemies' motions, and to take, surprise, or destroy them as they shall have opportunity.\" (1.) July, 5, 1689, another company of 50 men was sent to Dunsta ble and Lancaster as a reinforcement, and twen ty men to Major Henchman at Pawtucket, as a guard for the settlers. The timely warning to Maj. Henchman proba bly saved the settlement from a fate similar to that of the unfortunate Waldron, for in another letter of Maj. Henchman to the Governor and Council, dated July 12, 1689, (2) he says, after mentioning \"the great and imminent danger we are in (at Chelmsford,) upon account of the ene my, the town being threatened the next week to be assaulted.\" \"And also at Dunstable, on Thursday night last towards morning, appeared within view of Mr. Waldo's garrison four Indi ans, who showed themselves as spies, and it is judged, (though not visible) that all the garrisons in said town were viewed by the enemy ; and that by reason thereof their cattle and other crea tures were put into a strange affright.

In the summer of 1691 the war was renewed, and the Indian ravages recommenced. Small scouting parties attacked many of the neighbor ing settlements. Like beasts of prey, they came without warning, and retired without detection. On the evening of Sept. 2, 1691, they suddenly appeared in this town, and attacked the house of Joseph Hassell, senior. Hassell, his wife Anna Hassell, their son Benjamin Hassell, and Mary Marks, daughter of Patrick Marks, were slain.

All of these are origi nal settlers, active, useful and influential men, and all of them town officers, chosen but a few weeks previous. The actors in those scenes have passed away and even tradition has been forgotten. The only record which exists of the circumstances of the massacre, is the following scrap, noted down prob ably by the Rev. Mr. Weld, not long after it oc curred. \"Anno Domini 1691.

In March 1694 a law was enacted by the Gen eral Court, \"that every settler who deserted a town for fear of the Indians, should forfeit all his rights therein.\" So general had the alarm become : that this severe and unusual statute was neces sary. Yet neither the statute, nor the natural courage of the settlers which had never quailed., was sufficient to withstand the protracted and incessant peril which menaced Dunstable, and in 1696 the Selectmen affirmed, that \"near two thirds of the inhabitants have removed them selves with their rateable estates out of the town.\" The town, harassed and poor, prayed an abate ment of \u00a3 50, part of their state tax, due by those who had left town, and this request was granted accordingly- (1) Troops were kept here for the protection of the settlers who remained, and all the garrisons were placed under the supervision of Jonathan Tyng, who had previously been named in the Royal Charter as one of the Royal Council of the province.

In a preceding war (to that of 1703,) he had been taken prisoner in the vicinity of Dunstable, and carried to Canada, from whence, by his shrewdness and sagacity, he effected his escape and returned to his friends at Dunstable.\" Joe English was quite a hero in these regions and in those days, and a hill in New Boston, ve ry abrupt on one side, and a pond in Amherst, are still called by his name. A tradition is cur rent that Joe^was once pursued by an Indian on this hill, and finding it impossible to escape oth erwise, he allowed his pursuer to approach him very closely, and then ran directly towards the precipice, threw himself suddenly down upon a ledge with which he was familiar, while his pur suer, unable to arrest his course, and unconscious of danger, was dashed in pieces at the bottom. Numerous other anecdotes are related of Joe, but we will not repeat them, or vouch for their truth. The story of the capture and escape of Joe English is told at greater length by the compiler of \" Indian Anecdotes.\" \" A party of English were a stacked by the Indians on Penichuck brook, in the north part of Dunstable, and were all kill ed except four persons, one of whom was Joe (1.) 1 Belknap, 173, note."], [95, "67 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, &C English, a friendly Indian, whohad rendered him self peculiarly serviceable to the English. Him they took prisoner arid sent to Canada, where he pretended to be highly exasperated against the white men, and said he meant hereafter to be a good Indian ; that the whites had deceived him and he would not trust them in future. \" After these professions of fidelity to their in terests, he told them that if they would let him have the command of a party of Indians, he would go and surprise Deerfield, one of the fron tier towns of Massachusetts. They accordingly furnished him with a party, and he soon com menced his march. He also persuaded the In dians to let one of the English prisoners accom pany him. On their arrival at the mountains which surrounded Deerfield, Joe told them that he was afraid that they had not provisions enough for the expedition, and that previous to the attack it would be better to hunt one day. To this the company assented. Joe told them they must go around the mountain, and drive the deer towards where they were, and that he and the English man would remain where they were, and kill them as they approached. ( \" Joe had purposely taken his station at a place where he could reach the town, and sent the In dians around the mountain so that he knew he should not be interrupted in his attempt to join the English. The Indians having gone in pur suance of his directions, he and his comrade fled to the settlement and apprised the inhabitants of Deerfield of their danger. The Indians soon dis covered the deception of their commander, by the firing of guns and beating of drums which were heard from the town, and the attempt was aban doned.

The Indians of course felt an invet erate hostility against him, and determined upon securing him. They therefore waylaid all the places where they should be likely to take him, but still he escaped their stratagems.\"(l.) Whether this story be authentic or not 1 cannot say; \" I tell the tale as 'twas told to me.\" That he was captured, however, and that he escaped from captivity, we do know, but how or where no record discloses. It appears from a grant made by the General Court of Massachusetts, June 14, 1698, to \"Joseph English an Indian es caping from French Captivity,\" that he had just returned, and the sum of \u00a36 was allowed him as a \" recompense for his services \" in \" giving in telligence of the motions of the enemy with in tent to do mischief upon the frontiers at this time.\" (2) It was also during this war, in 1697, that the celebrated Mrs. Duston was captured at Have r hill, and escaped by killing her captors, ten in number, at the mouth of the Contocook river in Concord, N. H. This was considered as one of the most remarkable and heroic exploits on re cord. In her lonely wanderings down the Mer rimac homeward, the first house she reached was that of old John Lovewell, father of \" worthy Capt. Lovewell,\" which stood on the north side of Salmon brook a few feet north-east of the Allds bridge. The cellar is still visible.

Such was its effect, indeed, that though as early as 1680 there were thirty families or more in the town, in 1701 the number did not exceed twenty-five fam ilies.(1.) The settlement had more than once been nearly deserted, and very few improvements were made. A saw mill had been erected at the earliest settlement, and others followed at \" Mine Falls\" and on Salmon brook, but no grist mill had been built, the inhabitants resorting to Chelmsford. In 1695, Daniel Waldo set up a grist mill at the mouth of Stony Brook, several miles down the Merrimac, and was \" to grind the corn and mall of the inhabitants of Chelmsford, except on the fourth day of each week which is ap propriated to the use of Dunstable.\" He agreed to grind \"according to turn as much as may be.\" (2.) Oct. 4, 1697, every inhabitant was ordered \"to bring half a cord of wood to Mr. Weld by the first of November, or forfeit^zye shillings for each neglect.\" This was in addition to his salary. As silver was then worth ten shillings an ounce, five shillings would be equal to half an ounce of silver, or 50 cents of our currency. This would make the value of wood about a dollar a cord. In 1698 the town joined with other towns in rebuilding Billerica bridge, and raised for that purpose and other town expenses, \u00a36 7s. Of course it could not have been a very splendid or expensive structure. June 29, 1699, it was voted that John Lollen dine \"build a sufficient cross bridge over Salmon (1.) Petition 1701 supra. (2.)

The bridge was to be wairanted \" to stand a twelvemonth, and if the water carry it away, he is to rebuild it at his own cost.\" In 1699 the \" woodrate \" was increased, and assessed according to the ability of the inhabi tants, who were required to furnish him nineteen cords. The \" minister rate \" assessed upon the proprietors of Dunstable, including inhabitants, was \u00a317 25. 2d. (perhaps $50.00,) and was prob ably the amount of his salary. It is a singular and instructive fact, and one that might lead to useful reflections, that Mr. Weld was assessed, like any other inhabitant, both to the wood-rate and minister's rate, \u2014 to the former one cord and to the latter eleven shillings. I had supposed that the respect \"paid the pastor in those days was so great, as to exempt him from all such burdens, but it seems that the prin ciple of equality was carried into rigorous prac tice. Nor did the \" minister \" receive any title except that of Mr., not even that of Rev., for this was an \"innovation of vanity \" upon puritan simplicity, of a much later date. D. D. and S. T.

A party of Indians had lately arrived in the vicinity, and on that day had designed to attack both Weld's and Galusha s garrisons. One of their number had been sta tioned to watch each of these garrisons, to see that no assistance approached and no alarm was given.

After hastily plundering the house, and murder ing, as they supposed, all who were within it, the Indians set it on fire, and immediately re tired. The woman, in this critical situation, at tempted to escape by the window, but found it too small. She however succeeded in loosening the stones, till she had opened a hole sufficient to admit of her passage, and with the house in flames over her head, she forced herself out and crawled into the bushes, not daring to rise for fear she should be discovered.

This am buscade was the consequence, and the story is thus told more at length as handed down by tra dition : \" After his return to Dunstable, Joe with another soldier was appointed to guard Captain Butterfield and his wife on a visit to some of their friends in the upper part of Chelmsford. They were mounted on horseback preceded by Joe, with his gun loaded, and the other soldier following in the rear. \"In passing Holden's Brook, now in Tyngsbo rough, a party of Indians discovered them, who immediately sired after they crossed the brook, killed the horse on which Capt. Butterfield and wife were riding, and then rushed on to kill their prey. Joe had gone too far from the brook to ef fect his retreat, and he being the principal object they wished to secure, they pursued him. Capt. Butterfield and the other soldier made their es cape, but Mrs. Butterfield was taken prisoner. \"Joe espying on his left a considerable thicket of woods, ran towards it with all possible haste, but he found the Indians gained upon him. He, therefore, turned round, faced them, and present ed his gun, upon which they fell immediately to to the ground. This gave Joe some advantage, and after taking breath he set out again for the thicket. This he repeated several times, when the Indians, finding he was likely to escape by his near approach to the woods, with which they knew he was perfectly acquainted, and where he could easily conceal himself, one of them fired, and the ball entered the arm with which he car ried his gun, which he was immediately com pelled to drop, and ran with greater speed than before.

Joe was not ignorant ofthe suffering that awaited him, and wished to provoke them so much that they might despatch him at once. They soon came up to him, and vented their feelings in all the expressions of savage triumph and pleasure. \u2014 \"Now Joe,\" said they, \"we've got you.\" Joe immediately made them a gesture and a reply of such insulting scorn, that they were highly irritat ed. His purpose was answered, for they des patched him with their tomahawks without fur ther ceremony.\" (I.) Joe English was a grandson of Mascoiinomet, chief Sagamore of Agawam, (Ipswich, Mass.) As one of his heirs he owned an interest in large tracts of land lying in that vicinity and upon the Merrimac, which he conveyed by various deeds in 1701 and 1702. (2.) Many are the stories which are related of his courage, his fidelity, his adventures, and his hair breadth escapes. His death was lamented as a public loss. The Gen eral Assembly made a grant to his widow and two children \" because he died in the service of his country.\" (3.)

A company of \"snowmen\" were kept scouting, and ordered here for the protec tion of the settlement, under Col. Tyng, and garrisons established at several places at which the settlers dwelt. The history of the frontiers until the. close of the war, in 1713, is but a series ol attacks, burnings, captivity, and massacre. \"From 1675 to 1714 it is estimated that Massa chusetts and New Hampshire lost 6000 young men and male children, including those killed aud those who were made captives without ever being recovered.\" In November, 1711, ihe inhabitants still lived principally in garrison houses, where soldiers under the pay of the Colony were stationed con stantly for their defence.

They never once met the English in open field : but always, even if eight fold in number, fled timorously before infantry.

After the close of Queen Anne's war, by the ratification of the treaty of peace between France and England, at Utrecht, a treaty was made with the Indians at Ports mouth, N. H., in July, 1713, and quiet reigned throughout the frontiers for many years. The emigrants pushed their settlements farther aud farther into the wilderness, and the smoke curling up from many a cabin along the green hill sides. and in the rich valleys, gave signs of advancing civilization. The distant Indians, however, were still hostile and treacherous, although, being de serted by France, they were compelled to make peace. In 1717 they began to be more and more inso lent, killing the cattle and threatening the lives of the settlers, and occasioned so much alarm that a Fast was ordered. These outrages were imputed to the instigations of the French mis sionaries, (the Jesuits) who were jealous of the growth of the English plantations. In August, 1717, however, a congress was held with them at Arrowsick on the Kennebec River, and the treaty of 1713 was renewed. (1.) This apparent friend ship lasted but a short time, owing, as was said, (l.) Penhallow. 1 N. H. Hist.

Now other settlements had commenced beyond us, although yet in their infancy, and in capable of affording much protection. As early as 1710 settlements were made in Hudson. Lon donderry (then called Nutfield) was settled in 1719, and Litchfield (then called Brenton's Farm, or by its ancient Indian name, Naticook) in 1720. Chester was also settled in 1720, and Merrimac and Pelham in 1722. During the years 1722 3-4, frequent ravages were committed and much alarm excited. As we look around on our beau tiful villages and thickly peopled towns, we can scarcely realize that a little more than a century ago the yell of the Indian was heard even here, and the shriek of the murdered settler went up to heaven with the flames of his desolated home. In the summer of 1723 the Indians attacked Dover and Lamprey River, and fearing an attack upon the settlements in this vicinity, a garrison of thirty men was posted in Dunstable.

The company was raised and a com mission of Captain given to Lovewell. They became greatly distinguished, first by their suc cess, and afterwards by their misfortunes. Lovewell was then in the prime of life, and burning with zeal to distinguish himself. With his company of picked men he started upon an excursion into the Indian country.

They had been alarmed the preceding night by noises round their camp, which they imagined were made by Indians, and this opinion was now strengthened. They suspected that the Indian was there to decoy them, and that a body of the enemy was in their front. A consultation being held they determined to march forward, and by encompassing the pond, to gain the place where the Indian stood. That they might be ready for action they disencum bered themselves of their packs, and left them without guard at the northeast end of the pond, in a pitch pine plain, where the trees were thin, and the brakes at that time of the year small.\""], [147, "117 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, kC.

They therefore placed themselves in ambush to attack them on their return. The Indian who stood on the point, and who was re turning to the village by another path, met them and received their fire, which he returned and wounded Farwell and another with small shot. Lieut. Wyman firing again killed him and they took his scalp. \"Seeing no other enemy they returned to the place where they had left their packs, and while they were looking for them the Indians rose and ran towards them with a horrid yelling.

In this forlorn place they took their station. On their right was the mouth of a brook at that time unfordable ; on their left was the rocky point. Their front was partly covered with a deep bog, and partly uncovered, and the pond was in the rear. The enemy galled them in front and in flank, and had them so completely in their power, that had they made a prudent use of their advantage, the whole company must either have been killed or obliged to surrender at discretion, being destitute of a mouthful of sus tenance, and escape being impracticable. \" Under the conduct of Lieut. Wyman, they kept up their sire, and shewed a resolute counte nance all the remainder of the day, during which their Chaplain, Jonathan Frye, Ensign Robbins, and one more were mortally wounded. The Indians invited them to surrender by holding up ropes to them, and endeavored to intimidate them by their hideous yells, but they determined to die rather than to yield. By their well directed fire the number of the savages was thinned, and their cries became fainter, till just before night they quitted their advantageous ground, carrying off their killed and wounded, and leaving the dead bodies of Lovewell and his men unscalped. The shattered remnant of this brave company collected themselves together, and found three of their number unable to move from the spot ; eleven wounded, but able to march ; and nine only who had received no hurt. All the rest, eleven in number, were slain. \"It was melancholy to leave their dying com panions behind, but there was no possibility of"], [149, "119 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, kC. removing them. One of them, Ensign Robbins, (1.) desired them to lay his gun by him charged, that if the Indians should return before his death, he might be able to kill one more. After the rising of the moon they quitted the fatal spot, and directed their march towards the Fort, where the surgeon and guard had been left. To their great surprise they found it deserted. In the beginning of the action one man (whose name has not been thought worthy to be transmitted,) quitted the field, and fled to the Fort. Here, in the style of Job's messengers, he informed them of Lovewell's death, and the defeat of the whole company, upon which they made the best of their way home, leaving a quantity of bread and pork, which was a seasonable relief to the retreating survivors.\" The fate of the survivors was scarcely less pitiable than that of the dead. \" Lieutenant Farwell, (of Dunstable) and the Chaplain, who had the journal of the march in his pocket, perished in the woods for want of dressing their wounds.

In addition to the gifts above cited, other donations were made, and the Township of Pembroke, first called \" Lovewell's Town\" was granted by the General Assembly of Massachu setts, \" in May, 1727, to Capt.

Samuel Whitney was wounded, and probably died not long after, as no mention of him is found in the Records of the town after May, 1725. Noah Johnson was so severely \" wounded in the sight as to be disabled \" for many years, but was the last survivor of the company. In 1727 a pension of \u00a310 per annum for seven years was granted him by the Colony of Massachusetts, and after its expiration in 1734, the sum was increased to \u00a315 per annum, and continued for many years.

The grand children of some of these still survive in this town and vicinity. Several of the ballads which were written to commemorate this event, one of the most impor tant in our early history, have been preserved. If they do not possess high poetic merit, they answered well the purpose for which they were designed. \" Let me make the ballads of a peo ple,\" said the great Chatham, \" and I care not who makes the laws.\" There was deep wisdom in the remark, and such ballads, rude though they were, nurtured the free, bold, self-sacrificing spirit, which wrested Canada from the French in 1755, and finally achieved our Independence. One of the oldest of these ballads, composed, as is said, the year of the fight, \" the most beloved song in all New England,\" is here inserted. (I.) SONG OF LOVEWELL'S FIGHT. I. Of worthy Captain Lovewell I purpose now lo sing, How valiantly he served his country and his king; He and his valiant soldiers did range the woods full wide, And hardships they endured to quell the Indians' pride.

'Twas nigh mito Pigwacket, on the eighth day of May, They spied a rebel Indian soon after break of day; He on a hank was walking, upon a neck of land, Which leads into a pond as we're made to understand.

Our men resolved to have him and travelled two miles round, Until they met the Indian who boldly stood his ground ; Then speaks up Captain Lovewell, \"Take you good heed,\" says he, \" This rogue is to decoy us I very plainly see. of Judge Parker.

They come unto the Indian who did them thus defy : As soon as they come nigh him two guns he did let fly, Which wounded Captain Lovewell and likewise one man more, (1.) But when this rogue was running they laid him in his gore. VI. Then having scalped the Indian they went back to the spot Where they had laid their packs down, but there they found them not; For the Indians having spied them when they them down did lay, Did seize them for their plunder and carry them away. VII. These rebels lay in ambush this very place near by, So that an English soldier did one of them espy ; And cried out, \" here 's an Indian \" ; with that they started out As fiercely as old lions, and hideously did shout. VIII. With that our valiant English all gave a loud huzza, To show the rebel Indians they feared them not a straw; So now the fight began as fiercely as could be; The Indians ran up to them but soon were forced to flee. IX. Then spake up Captain Lovewell when first the fight began, \u2014 \"Fight on my valiant heroes! you see they fall like rain;\" For as we are informed, the Indians were so thick, A man could scarcely fire a gun and not some of them hit.

'Twas ten o'clock in the morning when first the fight begun, And fiercely did continue till the setting of the sun, Excepting that the Indians some hours before 'twas night, Drew off into the bushes, and ceased a while to fight.

The statement in the last verse that Paugus was killed by Wyman is not correct. He was slain by John Chamberlain, who afterwards set tled in Merrimac. After the heat of the conflict was over, weary and faint, Paugus and Cham berlain both went down to the pond to quench their thirst, and to wash out their guns which had become foul by continued firing. There they met and at once recognized each other, for Paugus was known personally to many of the company. Seeing the useless condition of each others' guns, they tacitly agreed to a truce while they were cleaning them. During this process some words were ex changed, and Paugus said to Chamberlain, \" It is you or I.\" Cautiously but with haste they proceeded in their work, for it was a case of life or death. Paugus had nearly finished loading, and was priming his piece, when Chamberlain struck the breech of his gun violently upon the ground, thus causing it to prime itself, and shot Paugus through the heart, the bullet of Paugus at the same instant grazing the head of Chamberlain.

Garrisons were built, and armed scouts kept out constantly, but the frontiers were now beyond us. Sometimes, indeed, individual Indians ap peared mysteriously, seeking the life of some offending settler who had slain a relative, to appease his restless spirit by the sacrifice of '\u2022 blood for blood.\"' Such tales they tell of Chamberlain, the slayer of Paugus, of Ford, and others noted in fight, and how, mysteriously disappearing, the layer in wait became the victim. Perilous conflicts, providential escapes and strange adventures were thickly woven in the romance of our early history, but the remem brance of most of them has passed away utterly. and of others but dim and doubtful traditionary shadows remain. These traditions, handed down from the survivors long since departed, too direct and circumstantial to be entirely fictitious, and fixing neither time, nor place, nor actors of the scene, meet the enquirer at every step in his in vestigations, and excite longings and questions which cannot be gratified. If there were indeed \" tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,\" and \" sermons in stones,\" what thrilling tales might not some of our old denizens of field and forest unfold ' Many anecdotes which have been handed down, if not entirely authentic, are at least characteristic of the times in which they are said to have occurred, and probably possess some foundations. The following are specimens :"], [163, "133 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, kC. A party of Indians, it is said, once came sud denly upon Ford, \" the Indian Fighter,\" so that he had no chance to escape. He was splitting logs for rails, and had just driven in his wedge and partly opened a log. Pretending to be very anxious to complete the work, he requested them to put their hands in the cleft, and pull it open, while he drove in the wedge. Suspecting nota ing they did so, but watching his opportunity he dexterously knocked the wedge out instead of in. The log closed tight upon their fingers, and held them fast, and the whole party became his prisoners. \" At a later period an Indian appeared in Dun stable enquiring for ' Joe Snow,' who at some former time had slain his kinsman. The duty of revenge had long been transmitted, and the desire nourished ; and the descendants of the aggrieved and restless warrior had now coiiv? thus far through the wilderness, even from Can ada, guided by tradition alone, to avenge and pacify his spirit. This errand, however, was vain, for ' Joe Snow ' had long ago departed.' At some period during \" Lovewell's War,\" William Cummings of this town, was wounded by the Indians, but how, when, or where, no record tells. For his wounds he received the sum of \u00a310 from the Colonial Treasury. (1.) \" An Indian once called upon Chambersain at his saw mill, intending to way-lay him on his return homeward at nightfall, through the forest.

While ab sent they were attacked by a party of predatory Indians, and nearly all of them were killed. A few escaped and returned home bringing the sad tidings of the death of their companions and neighbors. \" One man; however, who was left in the field for dead, survived. His name was Whitney, and he lived in what is now the southerly part of Nashua, near Long Hill. He was too weak to think of returning home alone through the track less and unpeopled forest, so he built him a hut of logs, and bark, and branches of trees, and there passed the winter, subsisting chiefly on roots and cranberries. In the Spring another party went out to find and bury the dead, and came to this hut which they supposed to be that of an Indian. As they approached they saw something stir within it. One of the party fired, \u2014 a groan followed, but the victim, to their great astonishment and grief, proved to be the unfortu nate Whitney. He was just preparing to return home, having survived his wounds and all the perils and hardships of a winter in the wilder ness, only to perish by the hands of his own friends and townsmen.\"'"], [165, "CHAPTER IX. CIVIL HISTORY OF THE TOWN UNTIL ITS DIVI SION BY THE NEW STATE LINE IN 1741. The settlement of the town which had been so much and so long retarded, \u2014 which for forty years had scarcely advanced at all, now increased rapidly. But the inhabitants were extremely poor. In addition to the heavy public taxes occasioned by the long and expensive Indian Wars, they had suffered much from the incur sions of the enemy \u2014 from the loss of the ransoms paid for the release of their captive friends, and from the obstruction of all regular employment. In consideration of the universal scarcity of money, the General Assembly of Massachusetts issued bills of credit in 1721 to the amount of \u00a350,000, to be distributed among the several towns in proportion to the public taxes. They answered the purpose of money for the time. \u2014 Nov. 7, 1721, Lt. Henry Farwell and Joseph Blanchard were appointed Trustees to receive and loan out \" the share\" of this town, in such sums that \"no man shall have more than five pounds, and no man less than three pounds/' and shall pay five per cent, interest for the use of the same to the Town. In 1727 the General Assembly, finding this mode of making money popular, issued \u00a360,000 more. The share belonging to this town was received and loaned to Rev. Mr. Prentice, to be *12"], [166, "136 HISTORY OF applied in payment of his future salary as it should become due. Thus early and easily did men discover and adopt the practice of throwing their debts upon posterity. The consequence of these issues was a ruinous depreciation in their value \u2014 a nominal rise in the value of every species of property, speculation, and at last uni versal distress. In 1750 the bills were worth but 12 per cent. The general poverty of the inhabitants may also be inferred from the fact, that no represen tative was sent to the General Assembly, although directed so to do, the Town voting regularly from 1693 to 1733 \"not to send.\" Whenever the interests of the Town were in danger, however, a special agent was sent to see that they were protected. As an illustration of the feelings and peculiarities of those times it may be added, that, February 1, 1631, it was \"voted not to choose any person as Representative, deem ing ourselves not obliged by Laic.\" But in order to be certain as to their rights and duties, the next year they took legal advice upon this subject, and again voted \" not to send, finding the Town not obliged by Law.\" At that time the repre sentative received no compensation for attend ance, but his expenses were paid by the town. In 1718 the compensation was fixed by statute at three shillings per day. At one period the General Assembly hired an inn- keeper to board all of the members at a stipulated price per day, including wine, \" but not to exceed one cup of sack each.\" This was done not only for econo my, but for the greater despatch of business. For many years little occurred here which would be of general interest. The records are chiefly valuable as serving to shew the contrast"], [167, "137 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, kC. between the past and the present, and the slow and painful steps by which towns arrive at ma turity. Some memoranda of this period, there fore, may serve to amuse and perhaps instruct the curious reader. In 1716 a committee was appointed by the town to lay out a road to Dracut, and \" to state the Country road from Capt. Tyng's to Nasha way River.\" Its width was declared to be \" four rods.\" \"Sept. 2, 1718, voted,\" that John Lovewell Senior, and his son John, [the Hero ofPeqnawk ett,] should hav liberty to bild a dam in the high way over Salmon Brook, not to incommodate the highway.\" This was at the little bridge near the 'house of Miss Allds, where the mud sills are still visible, and the \"highway\" was the \"Country road\" just mentioned. \" March 31, 1819, Joseph French was chosen to make coffins where there be need for the year ensuing.\" Friendly Indians still lived here, and this singular vote may have referred to them, as we find a charge made by him not long after, \" for Jacob Indian's coffin 7s.\" The Selectmen and other persons in the em ployment of the town at this period charged 5s. per day for their services. The humble Meeting House which had served for the worship of all the inhabitants, since no division into sects existed, was a rude, one story, unsteepled edifice, and would shew but poorly beside the erections of the present day. It was divided by an aisle in the centre, with rows of benches on either side, one of which was appro priated for the use of the women, and the other"], [168, "138 HISTORY OF for the use of the men. Such a separation was not unfrequent in those primitive days. (1.) But even among our grave and simple fore fathers, luxury and ambition crept in. March 2, 1720, it was \" Voted that Lt. Henry Farwell and Joseph Blanchard should hav the libety to erect for themselves two Pewes on there own charge at the west end of the Meeting House.\" The example was contagious, so dangerous is a precedent. If Lt. Farwell and Capt. Blanchard could afford \"Pewes,\" why might not others 1 Ma\"y 18, 1720, it was- \" Voted that there be four Pewes erected in our Meeting House ; one on the back side of the lowermost seats, and one seat to be taken up ; Sargt. Colburn, one pew ; Sargt. Perham, one pew; Nathaniel Cummings, one pew; Oliver Farwell, one pew.\" The first pauper in town appears to havr been Joseph Hassell. a son probably of him who was slain by the Indians in 1691. He was sup ported by the town, who appointed a person \" io take care of\" him in 1722 or 1723. In 1723 Grand Jurymen were chosen by the town at the annual meeting by ballot. This (I.) The following is a description of the early Meeting Houses as drawn up by Rev. Leonard Bacon of New Haven: \u2014 \"Immedi ately before the pulpit, and facing the Congregation was an elevated seat for the ruling- elder, and before that, somewhat lower, was a seat for the Deacons behind the Communion Table. On the floor of the house there were neither pews nor slips, but plain seats. \u2014 On each side of what we may call the centre aisle were nive seats of sufficient length to accommodate five or six persons. On each side of the pulpit at the end were five cross Stats,and another shorter than the five. Along each wal of the house, between the cross scats and the side door, six seats. The men and women were seated separately, on opposite sides of the house, and every one according to his office, or his age, or his rank in society, and his place was -ssigned by a committee ap pointed for that purpose. The children and young people at the first seating seem to have been left to find their own places, away from their parents, in that part of the house which was not occu pied with seats prepared at the town's expense.\""], [169, "NASHUA, NASHVILLE, &C 139 was probably done as a precaution against the encroachments of the officers of the crown, and as a safeguard of popular rights. One tribunal was secure from royal influence, and no indi vidual could be unjustly condemned. This mode of choice continued till after the revolution, and was a source of great annoyance to the enemies of America, who complained that the Towns chose the most active opponents of England for their Grand Jurors, so that those guilty of politi cal offences could not be indicted. (1.) In 1723 the choice of a Ty thing man, Thomas Blanchard, is first recorded. The Town raised \u00a320 [about $70] to defray all town expenses, and the collector had \"3 pence in the pound [1 1-4 per cent] for gathering all Town rates for ye year.\" In 1724 the Town was again called upon to assist in keeping \" the great bridge in Billerica in good repare,\" and chose Henry Farwell \" to jine with the committy appinted \" for that pur pose. 1729 they united with Dracut, Chelms ford, and Billerica in further repairs, and 1731 expended \u00a33 10s. for the same purpose. This bridge was over the Concord river on the main road to Boston, and of great importance. The method of voting for all the more impor tant officers was \" by ballot,\" while others of less importance were chosen \" by holding up of ye hands.\" So early did our forefathers recog nize that truly republican principle and safeguard of popular rights, the secret ballot. In those days offices were not only places of honor and profit, but also of good cheer. Those (l.) Gov. Hutchinson's Letters."], [170, "140 HISTORY OF were glorious times for dignitaries. Among the accounts presented for acceptance, and which were allowed and paid by the Town without scruple, we find the following : \"Town of Dunstable to Snmuel French, Dr 1726. To dining the Selectmen 6 meals, \u00a30 6* Od for rhum and ci/der had at Mr William Lund's for the Selectmen, 0 12 6.\" We are accustomed to look back upon that early period as an age of primitive simplicity and virtue. Yet what would be said of such an account in these Temperance days? But their faults were only those of rude and hardy pioneers, and of the age, and we would institute no comparison. They laid a noble foundation for our Republic. \"Every man who was forty years old,\" says Belknap, \" had seen twenty years of war.\" Such continual dangers and hardships, although affording no good school for cultivation and refinement, furnished a race of hardy soldiers and sterling patriots for the \"times that tried men's souls.\" In March, 1727, the town raised \" eight pounds for building a boat,\" and it was directed \" that Capt. Blanchard should return the boat within the year to the Town.\" This was probably for a Ferry-boat over the Merrimac. at the Blanch ard farm, [now Little's] as Hudson was then included in Dunstable, and a few settlers had located themselves on that side of the river. \u2014 The bridge existed for a century after. October 29 and 30, 1727, at night a shock of an earthquake was felt here. It effected chiefly \" the towns upon the Merrimac.\" \" The shock was very loud and was attended with a terrible noise like thunder. The houses trembled as if they were falling. Divers chimnies were crack-"], [171, "141 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, &C ed, and some had their tops broken off. Flashes of light broke out of the earth, and the earth broke open.\" The shocks lasted until February, 1728. (1.) At this time taverners were licensed by the County-Court. In the fall of 1727, Capt. Joseph Blanchard, who had been the inn-keeper of the town for many years, died, and as the Court was not in session in December, 1727, Henry Farwell Jr., petitioned the General Assembly for a license which was granted. (2.) In 1728 a boom was built across Merrimac River by the town. Among the early settlers of New England the principles of jurisprudence were but little known, and there were few lawyers. The jurisdiction of courts of law was limited, and as many of the judges had received no preparatory legal educa tion to fit them for the bench, but were taken directly from the counting room or camp, all settled rules of law were of course unknown and disregarded. The people, therefore, in all cases of difficulty applied at once to the General As sembly, who assumed and exercised jurisdiction in imitation of the English Parliament, as a court of Errors and of Chancery in all cases whatsoever, where their assistance was needed for the purposes of Justice. A committee having been appointed by the town to purchase the ministerial farm of Rev. Mr. Coffin as a parsonage for Mr. Prentice, and refusing to convey it as directed, the Town ap plied to the General Court of Massachusetts by a \" petition for some redress, if it may be obtained, (1.) 4 N.

The amount of taxes raised from 1726 to 1733 for the general expenses of the Town, including the support of the ministry, varied from $250 to $400 per year. The subject of education was One of deep interest to the early settlers of New England. \u2014 To them must be awarded the enviable distinc tion of their being the first to lay down the noble principle, that \"every child should be taught to read and write,\" and the first to establish com mon schools to carry it into effect. It was ever the custom, and became the law in Puritan New England as early as 1642, that \"none of the brethren should suffer so much barbarism in their families, as not to teach their children and ap prentices so much learning, as may enable them perfectly to read the English Language.\" A fine of 20 shillings was imposed for every neg lect, and, if after reproof by the Selectmen, they still neglected this duty, the children were to be taken from them, and bound out, males until 21, and females until 18 years of age. In 1646 it was enacted that \"if any child above 16 years old. and of sufficient understand ing, shall curse or smite his natural father or mother, he shall be put to death, unless it can be sufficiently testified, that the parents have been VERY UNCHRISTIANLY NEGLIGENT IN THE EDUCATION of such children.\" This was the Mosaic Law, but with au important and characteristic quali fication. \" To the end that learning may not be buried in the graves of our forefathers,\" it was ordered"], [173, "143 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, kC. in 1647, \"that every township, aster the Lord hath increased them to the number of fifty house holders, shall appoint one to teach all the children to read and write : And when any town shall increase to the number of one hundred families they shall set up a grammar school, the master whereof being able to instruct youth so far as they may be fitted for the university.\" These provisions, furnishing the best academic educa tion to every child gratuitously, go far beyond our present School Laws, and we might do well to retrace our steps. For non-compliance the Towns were liable to indictment, and a fine was imposed for the benefit of the school in the next Town. One reason which determined the Puritans upon a removal from Leyden was, \" That the place being of great licentiousness and liberty to children, they could not educate them : nor could they give them due correction without reproof or reproach from their neighbors.\" Their ideas of government, family and national, were all derived from the Mosaic code, and. as was said of the Connecticut settlers, they \" agreed to take the laws of God for their guide until they had time to make better.\" But, deeply as the settlers felt the importance of Education, it was no easy matter in a frontier town, where a fierce Indian War was raging, when the inhabitants dwelt iu garrisons and the settlement was every day liable to an attack, to establish common schools. The dense forest, where the quiet of the school room might be broken at any time by the yell of the savage, was no fitting time or place for helpless children ; still at home education was not neglected, as the state of our ancient records everywhere attests. 13"], [174, "144 HISTORY OP So much were the inhabitants scattered that no school was kept in Town until 1730. In that year, it seems, the Town having increased to the requisite number of \"fifty house-holders,\" and having neglected to provide a teacher according to Law, had been indicted by the Grand Jury. Nov. 3, 1730, it was accordingly voted, that \" it be left with the selectmen to provide and agree with a person to keep a writing school in the town directly\"; and, that \"the sum of Ten pounds be granted and raised for defraying the charges in the last mentioned concern and other Town charges.\" How liberal this provision was we may judge from the fact that the same sum, and even more, had been annually raised for Town charges alone, and that Dunstable then included the greater part of Hollis and Hudson within its limits ! How many inhabitants the Town then con tained we are unable to ascertain. If there were fifty house-holders or families, the number was probably about two hundred and fifty. How slow was the increase and how disastrous must have been the effect of the long Indian Wars, we may conjecture when we remember that as far back as 1680, there were thirty families, or nearly one hundred and fifty inhabitants, most of whom were settled within the present limits of Nashua. After this indictment, however, had been ar ranged, it appears that the Town relapsed into its ancient neglect and no further notice vvas taken of it. No record of any vote to raise money for the support of Schools, or to choose any school committee, or to build any school house, or any allusion to the subject of schools is found for many years. The Town was too"], [175, "145 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, kC. much distracted, at this period, perhaps, by ex citing religious and sectional questions, to attend to or agree upon any general plan of education. The inhabitants of Hollis and Hudson were de- sirous of being erected into separate townships. -Then came the question of erecting \"a decent meeting house,\"' and similar divisions ensued. The controversies about the boundary line between New Hampshire and Massachusetts, which finally divided Dunstable nearly in the middle, leaving one half of the territory within the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, and transfer ring the northern portion, with a large majority of the inhabitants, to New Hampshire, gave rise to an excitement still more intense and protracted. Then followed a succession of sectarian disputes about the Orthodox and New Lights, Congrega tionalists and Presbyterians, all of which were discussed and decided in Town meetings. \u2014 These, and similar controversies, with their con sequent victories and defeats, protests and recon siderations must have occupied their time suffi ciently to prevent their union upon any subject, where there might be conflicting interests or pre judices. After Lovewell's War, so great was the security felt by the settlers, that they plunged boldly into the wilderness in every direction. In July, 1729, the lands lying three miles north and south on Merrimac River, extending three miles east and four miles west of it, and bounded southerly by the Souhegan, [now the northerly part of Merrimac] were granted to Joseph Blanchard and others. Even as early as May, 1726, a set tlement was commenced at Concord. In Dun stable the outlands were taken up, and soon the wilderness was alive with population. So nu merous had they become that \" for greater"], [176, "146 HISTORY OF convenience of public worship \", they desired on every hand to be erected into townships. In 1731 the inhabitants on the east side of the Merrimac petitioned the town to be set off, which was granted to take effect \" whenever the Gen-. eral Court should think it advisable.\" Leave was obtained accordingly from the Assembly of Massachusetts, and the new township was called Nottingham. On the establishment of the bound ary line it fell within the State of New Hamp shire, obtained a new charter in 1746, and changed its name to Nottingham-West, there being already a Nottingham in the eastern section of the State. In 1732 the inhabitants on the northerly side of Nashua River petitioned to be set off also with Brenton's Farm, but the petition was not granted by the town. In 1733, however, part of the town lying west of Merrimac River was incorporated by the General Assembly into a township by the name of Rumford, but soon after was called Merrimac. July 3, 1734, Litchfield was incorporated. \u2014 Iu the petition for incorporation, dated May, 1734, and signed by \" Aquila Underwood for the Town \", it is stated, as a reason for the grant, that they have \"supported a minister for some time.\" While the jealousies and divisions, to which reference has been made, were existing in such strength, \" the old meeting house,\" it seems, had grown so old and out of repair, as not to be \"decent.\" Upon a vote taken in 1732 whether the town \" would build a decent meeting house or rectify and mend the old one \", it was decided not to \" rectify \", but to build. After quarrel-"], [177, "147 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, &C ling a year and holding various meetings, it was voted to build it \" about 4 rods westward of where the meeting house now stands\", upon which 19 persons, chiefly from that part of the town now lying in Massachusetts, entered their dissent of record against the location. In 1736 Hollis was set off from Dunstable by the name of \" the west parish of Dunstable\" ; but after the establishment of the boundary line, it received a new act of incorporation from the State of New Hampshire, by the name of Hollis. Its Indian name was Nissitisset. In the mean time settlements were extending rapidly all around, and the sorest was bowing before the onward tread of civilization. In 1734, Amherst was settled, and in 1736 a bridge was built across Souhegan River, then the northerly boundary of Dunstable, and a road laid out and built \" from the bridge to Dunstable meeting house.\" In 1732 Townsend was incorporated, taking in the southerly part of the town, including Pepperell. Thus township after township had become parcelled out from the original body of \"old Dunstable\", until in 1740 the broad and goodly plantation was reduced to that portion only which is now embraced within the limits of Nashua and Nashville, Tyngsborough and Dunstable. At length, after a long and violent controversy, and against the wishes of the inhab itants, the boundary line between New Hamp shire and Massachusetts was established in 1741, severing Dunstable very' nearly in the middle, and leaving the present towns of Nashua and Nashville within the limits of New Hampshire. With the exception of a small section set off to Hollis, this portion retains the territory which it *13"], [178, "148 HISTORY OF had in 1741. and contains by computation, about 18,878 acres. After the death of Rev. Mr. Prentice, Rev, Josiah Swan received a call to settle over the church and town. He accepted the call, and was ordained Dec. 27, 1738. Mr. Swan is said to have been a native of Dunstable, and grad uated at Harvard in 1733. In 1739 he married Jane [Mr. Sperry says erroneously Kac/tasl.] Blanchard, daughter of Joseph Blanchard, Esq.. of this town. In 1741, however, on the division of the town by the new boundary, it became more difficult to support a minister. Not long afterwards the sect then called \" New Lights \" , but since known as Methodists, appeared, and a division in his society ensued. The churches were \"infected with lay exhorters, and some ministers who have left their parishes and charges and undertaken to play the bishop in another man's diocese\", as the regular clergy complained, and \"distracted by such persons exhorting and preaching in private houses with out the consent of the stated pastor.\" (I.) We have seen that the question of building a new meeting house was discussed as far back as 1732, and a vote taken fixing its location. In November, 1734, John Kendall and others re monstrated to the General Assembly against its location, and asked for a committee. (2.) The records of the town from 1733 to 1746 are lost, but it is known that the vote was inoperative and the house not built until 1738, when Mr. Swan was settled. It stood near the old burying ground not far from the State line, having been built for the accommodation of the original town (1.) Allen's Chelmsford, 116. (2.)

Immediately after the division of the town, it became necessary to erect a new meeting house in a more central situation. But so diverse were the interests and the feelings of our then widely scattered population, that no location was satisfactory. June 20, 1746. the town voted \" that the place of preaching the gospel this summer be at Ephraim Lund's barn.\" After sundry votes, protests and reconsiderations, com mittees, reports and compromises; the town voted to accept the proposal of Jona. Lovewell and others to build the meeting house on their own account, and to have the liberty of selling all the wall pews for their own benefit. The House was built accordingly in the au tumn of 1747. \"on a spot of rising ground about six rods west of the main road\" , which is a few rods northerly of the present South meet ing house. It was about twenty-eight feet by forty; had a small gallery, and was divided like the old one, into the \"men's cide*\" and the \" women's side.\""], [180, "CHAPTER X. HISTORY OF DUNSTABLE, N. H., TO THE OLD FRENCH WAR. April 4, 1746, the town was first incorporated by the State of New Hampshire, having previ ously acted under their charter, obtained from the General Court of Massachusetts, in 1673. \u2014 It retained the ancient name of Dunstable. In 1746 the great road to Tyngsborough was stated anew and recorded. There would seem to have been but few houses upon this road at that time. The following are all that are men tioned : \u2014 Capt. Joseph French's house was 8 rods north of the State line; Col. Joseph Blanch ard's house, 300 rods north of the State line, and 29 rods south of \"Cummings's Brook \"; Cyrus Bald win's near Col. Blanchard's; John Searles' house 66 rods north of Cummings's Brook : Hen ry Adams's 80 rods north of Searles' house; the old ditch which led to the Fort was 90 rods north of Adams's house ; Thomas Harwood's house was 90 rods north of the old ditch; no other house mentioned between Harwood's and Nashua River, excepting Jonathan Lovewell's, which was 2S3 rods south of the River, or at the Harbor, south of Salmon Brook. About this time the difficulties with Mr. Swan having increased, he was dismissed. He did not leave town, however, immediately, for we find"], [181, "151 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, kC. his name recorded the next year as having voted against a successor. He settled in full with the town, March 2, 1747. He did not remain here long, but returned to Lancaster, Mass., his former place of residence. Here he was engaged in the tuition of a school, which had been his occupa tion previous to his entrance upon the ministry, and became \" a famous teacher.\" He remained at Lancaster until about 1760, when he removed to Walpole, N. H., where he died. (1.) Of his character little is known, and a single anecdote has reached us. From this, however, from his dealings with the town in regard to his salary, and from the amount of his taxes, for he owned a farm, we may infer that he amassed some property, and was a prudent, stirring, thrifty, but not over spiritual man. One Sabbath morning, it is said, during the latter part of his ministry, while old Mr. Lovewell was alive, he forgot the day and ordered his hired men to their work. They objected, telling him it was Sunday. He would not believe it, but finally, says he, \" if it is Sunday, we shall soon see old father Lovewell coming up the hill\" ; and sure enough, punctual as the clock to the hour, the old man, then more than a hundred years of age, but who never missed a Sunday, was seen making his way to church, and Mr. Swan was convinced of his mistake. At this time there was neither school nor schoolhouse in town. Sept. 29, 1746, it was voted that \" Jona. Lovewell be desired to hire a school master until the next March for this town, upon the cost and charge of the town.\" \u2014 Two dwelling houses, one in the northern and one in the southern portions of the town, were (1.)

The number of in habitants was probably about 400. During this year the Indians committed much havoc in the frontier towns, around and above us. Many settlements above us were nearly or quite deserted. \"The defenceless state they were in obliged them all, namely, Peterborough, Salem Canada, [Lyndeborough,] New Boston and Hills borough, [so called,] entirely to draw off, as well as the forts on the Connecticut river. (1.) In the winter of 1745 and 1746 scouts were fur nished by this State and Massachusetts for the protection of those towns. In May, 1747, the inhabitants of Souhegan West, [Amherst,] and Monson, [a town formerly lying between Amherst and Hollis, afterwards divided and annexed to those towns,] petitioned Gov. Wentworth for a guard, being \" in imminent danger.\" The petition was granted, and his \" Excellency was desired to give orders for en listing or impressing fifteen good and efficient men, to scout and guard, under proper officers, said Souhegan West and Monson, till the twen tieth day of October next, if need be, and that said men be shifted once a month.\" It was about this time, probably, that Jonathan Farwell aud Taylor were taken captive by the Indians, while hunting in the south part of this town. They were carried to Canada, and sold to the French, where they remained in captivity three years ; but finally succeded in obtaining their release, and returned to their friends.

Samuel Bird preached here. Aug. 31, 1747, he received a call to settle, and was soon after ordained. By the terms of his contract he was to have \" 100 ounces of coined silver, Troy weight, sterling alloy, or the full value thereof in bills of public credit,\" or about $100,00 yearly, for his salary, provided \" that he preach a lecture once in three months al least in this town\" and \" visit and catechise the people.\" At this choice there was much dissat isfaction, and the town was nearly equally di vided. Mr. Bird was a \" New Light,\" and his ordi nation was a triumph. His friends, however, at the head of whom was Jonathan Lovewell, stood by. him, and by them the new meeting house, before mentioned, was erected. His opponents, at the head of whom was Col. Blanchard, com plained of the injustice of being compelled to pay Mr. Bird, and all who were dissatisfied were freely excused. But the quarrel was sec tarian, and could not be appeased. A division in the church ensued, and a new church was organized, which worshipped in the old meeting house, in conjunction with members from Tyngs borough and Dunstable. Lovewell and Blanch ard were both distinguished men, and had been much in public life. The question soon assumed a party shape and laid the foundation of political differences, which after the lapse of a century are not entirely forgotten or obliterated. It was soon discovered by Blanchard that neither by the new charter of the town, nor by"], [184, "154 HISTORY OF any existing law of the State was there any provision for calling the first meeting of the town, after its recent incorporation by New Hampshire. Massachusetts having no legal jurisdiction over the town, any organization under its old charter was illegal and void. He, therefore, petitioned the legislature of New Hampshire that an inves tigation might be had into the authority and proceedings of the town meeting, which gave Mr. Bird a call, and that all its transactions should be set aside as contrary to law. An investigation was held accordingly. Much evidence was introduced, and long and learned arguments made on both sides. The petitioners contended that they paid two thirds of the taxes, and Mr. Bird's friends rejoined that they had a majority of the voters. Finally, it was decided that the meeting was illegal \u2014 -all its proceedings were set aside, and a special act was passed providing for the call of a new meeting, and the legal organization of the township under its new charter. This was in 1748. (1.) After this decision, and the triumph of Blanch ard, Mr. Bird left town, and settled in New Haven, Conn., but afterwards became Chaplain in the Army, in the French War of 1755. At what period he left Dunstable is uncertain. Mr. Farmer says it was in 1751, (2.) but it was probably earlier. His name is not mentioned in the town records after 1748, nor was any money raised for the support of preaching by the town. In January, 1751, Jonathan Lovewell was at length chosen a committee to hire preaching, and in March, 1751, it was voted that the preaching ( 1 . ) Original papers in the office of Secretary of State, at Concord.

How strong was the feeling about the settle ment of Mr. Bird, and how bitter the hostility between his friends and his opponents, we may judge from sundry remarks contained in a peti tion of the inhabitants of Pine Hill to be set off to Hollis. The petition was dated June, 1763. \"Soon after Dunstable was incorporated,\" says the petition, \" they got into parties about the settlement of Mr. Bird. Each courted Pine Hill's assistance, promising to vote them off to Hollis as soon as the matter was settled. And so Pine Hill was fed with Sugar Plums for a number of years, till at length Dunstable cast off the mask and now appears in their true col ours.\" After alluding to the objections raised by Dunstable, they add: \u2014 \"Their apprehension must arise from some other quarter. They wish to keep us as a whip for one party or the other to drive out every minister that comes there, for they are always divided tcilh respect lo these things.\" (1.) In 1749, the town \" voted to hire a sclwol for eight months.\" One teacher only was to be employed, and the school was to be kept in four places in different parts of the town, alternately. Soon after this the French War commenced, which was very burdensome to the Province, and exposed the frontiers to Indian attacks, and no other record of any school is found until 1761, when the town raised a small sum, \" to hire schooling and houses for that end.\" This was at the commencement of the difficulties with the mother country, and the importance of education began to be more sensibly felt. After this time money was raised for this purpose almost every (1.)

In 1772, Jo seph Dix was \" the Schoolmaster,\" and he con tinued to teach in town for many years. In 1775 the town was divided into five School Districts, and school houses were first erected. In 1777 each district received its proportion of money from the town, and hired its own teachers, which had been formerly done by the town. \u2014 Females now began occasionally to be employed. From this period until 1790, about \u00a330, or $100 was raised annually for the support of schools, or twenty dollars to each district. From this fact we may imagine the advantages of education enjoyed by our fathers at that period, and com pare them with the privileges of children at the present day. The bridges over the Nashua have always been a source of much trouble and expense to the town. At what period, and where the first bridge was erected, cannot be ascertained with certainty, but there was a bridge over the Nashua not far from the present one at Main street, pre vious to 1746, when the road was surveyed and recorded anew by the Selectmen in very near its present location. In the spring of 1753 it was carried away by a freshet, and rebuilt the same summer at an expense of \u00a3150. Before 1759 it was in a ruinous condition, and the town pe titioned to the General Court for \"liberty to raise a Lottery for repairing the Bridge, or build ing a new one.\" The lottery was not granted, but a new bridge was built, partly by subscrip tion, and partly by the town in 1746. It stood \" a little above \" the old bridge, but below the present.

Between 1752 aud 1756, (1.) died John Love well, at the great age of one hundred and twenty years, the oldest person who ever deceased in New Hampshire. He was one of the earliest settlers of Dunstable, after Philip's War, but of his history little is known. He came, it is said, originally from England, about 1660, and settled some years before 1690. It is not im probable that he came to this town from Wey mouth, as a person of the same name, from that town, was in the great Narragansett Swamp Fight, Dec. 19, 1675, and throughout Philip's War, under the famous Capt. Church ; and the hand-writing of this person corresponds very closely with that of John Lovewell of Dunsta ble. (2.) He is said, according to the tradition in the family, to have been an Ensign in the army of Cromwell, and to have left England on account of the Restoration of Charles II. in 1660. This army of 30,000 men was raised in 1653, and Cromwell died in 1658. During the Indian difficulties, about 1700, it is said that he was often spared by the Indians in their incur sions, because he had been kind to them in time of peace. (3.) He is represented as being even then old and white haired, and for such scalps the French Governor paid no bounty. The cellar of his house may still be seen on the north side of Salmon Brook, just above the bridge, by the road side, and there for a long time, when very much advanced in years, he kept a small store. There, too, he had a mill, and his farm reached far to the south of Salmon Brook. He must have been extremely vigorous, for as late as 1745, when more than one hundred years old, he was (1.)

It was finished in 1754, and a part of the materials of the old meeting house in the south part of the town, were used in its construction. (1.)

HISTORY OF DUNSTABLE FROiM THE FRENCH WAR TO THE REVOLUTION. However distracted and divided our predeces sors may have been in relation to religious affairs, we may justly be proud of them for their una nimity in patriotism. Exposed for so many years to the dangers of a border warfare, every citizen was a soldier. The story of Indian atrocities, and French instigation had been hand ed down from father to son, and not a few had shared personally in the conflicts. To hold a commission was then a high honor, and an object worthy of any man's ambition, for it was only bestowed upon those who had given proofs of' courage and capacity. Every officer might be called at any moment into actual service. The military spirit was fostered as a duty, and New England freedom, which placed in the hand of every child a gan as well as a spelling-book, made necessarily of every child not less a marks man than a scholar. When the French War broke out in 17'55, an expedition under General Sir William Johnson, was planned against Crown Point, then in pos session of the French. A regiment of five hun dred men was raised in New Hampshire for this purpose, and the command of it was given to Col. Joseph Blanchard of this town. One of the companies which composed the regiment was *14"], [190, "160 HISTORY OF the famous Rangers, of which Robert Rogers was Captain, and John Stark, (afterwards Gen eral,) was Lieutenant. The regiment was sta tioned at Fort Edward, and \" was employed in scouting, a species of service which none could perform so successfully as the Rangers of New Hampshire. Parties of them were frequently under the. very walls of the French garrisons. and at one time killed and scalped a soldier near the gate of the fort at Crown Point. Late in the autumn the forces were disbanded, and the regiment returned to their homes.\" One of the companies composing the regiment, went from Dunstable aud the vicinitv, and was commanded by Capt. Peter Powers of Hollis. Among the officers of the regiment we find the names of Jonathan Lovewell of this town, Commissary, Rev. Daniel Emerson of Hollis, Chaplain, and John Hale of Hollis. Surgeon. (1.) The war still continued, and New Hampshire still furnished her quota of troops for the service. In 1759 another regiment, consisting of one thousand men, were ordered out from this State. Col. Blanchard having died the year previous. the command of it was given to Col. Zaccheus Lovewell of this town, a brother of Capt. John Lovewell. This regiment, of which one or more companies were, from this vicinity, joined the main army under Lord Amherst, and was pres ent at the taking of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, where it did good service. The next year a regiment of eight hundred men was raised, chiefly from this vicinity, commanded by Col. John Gofle of Bedford. They were present at the capture of St. John's, Chamblee, Montreal, (1.) 5 N. H. Hist. Coll., 217, 218.

There is scarcely in the annals of America a company of troops more famous than \" Rogers's Rangers.\" Their life was one scene of constant exposure, and their story reminds one of the days of romance. The forest was their home, and they excelled even the Indian in cunning and hardihood. Everywhere they wandered in search of adventures, fearless and cautious, until their very name became a terror to the enemy. Even in the post of danger, when the army was advancing, they scouted lhe woods to detect the hidden ambush, and when retreating they skir mished in the rear to keep the foe at bay. If any act of desperate daring was to be done, the Rangers were \" the forlorn hope.\" At mid night they traversed the camp of the enemy, or carried off a sentinel from his post as if in mockery. Their blow fell like lightning, and before the echo had died away or the alarm sub sided, another blow was struck at some far dis tant point. They seemed to be omnipresent, and the enemy deemed that they were in league with evil spirits. The plain, unvarnished tale of iheir daily hardships and perilous wanderings, their strange adventures, and \"hair breadih 'scapes\" would be as wild and thrilling as a German legend. Of this company, and of others similar in character, a large number belonged to this town. The records are lost and their names are princi cipally forgotten.

His destination was Crown Point and Canada. A select company of Rangers was formed from the regiment, and the command given to Capt. Nehemiah Lovewell of this town. As a specimen of the military dress and discipline of the time, the following order is inserted. It is copied from Adjutant Hobart's record, and is dated Litchfield, May 25, 1760: \u2014 \"Col. Goffe requires the officers to be answerable that the men's shirts are changed twice every week at least; that such as have hair that will admit of it must have it constantly tyed ; they must be obliged to comb their heads, and wash iheir hands every morning, and as it is observed that numbers of the men accustom themselves to wear woollen nightcaps in the day time, he allows them hats ; they are ordered for the future not to be seen in the day time with any thing besides their hats on their heads, as the above mentioned"], [193, "163 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, &C. custom of wearing nightcaps must be detrimental to their health and cleanliness ; the men's hats to be all cocked, or cut uniformly as Col.

September 26, 1757, the town voted, \" that some measures be taken to settle the Gospel in this town \" ; and four persons were selected to preach one month each, on probation. Nov. 7, they gave a call to Rev. Elias Smith, (a gradu ate of Harvard in 1753,) but difficulty ensued, and Dec. 16, the call was retracted. (2.) It was a custom for those dissatisfied to enter their protest and as a curiosity and a specimen, the following is inserted : \" We the subscribers, being freeholders in Dunstable, do for ourselves protest against the choice of Mr. Elias Smith for our minister, which they have essayed to choose, and for these reasons; first, because we are not of the persuasion he preaches and indevors to maintain ; we are Presbyterians, and do adhere to the Westminster Confes sion of\" faith ; and do declare it to be the confession of our faith; and that we are members of the Presbyterian Church in Londonderry \u2014 some 18 years \u2014 some 15 years, and have partaken of Baptism, and of the Lord's supper as frequently as we could, they being the sealing ordi nances, and that we cannot in conscience join in calling or paying Mr. Smith.

There was also a protest of David Hobart and others against his settlement, because, as they say, \" Mr. Smith's preaching is contrary to our persuasion, and as we judge favors the Ar minian scheme, which we judge tends to pervert the truths of the Gospel, and darken the counsels of God.\" April 7, 1758, died Col.

He was born Feb. 11, 1704, and his grandfather, Deacon John Blanchard, was one of the first settlers of the town. His father, Capt. Joseph Blanchard, was town clerk, select man and proprietor's clerk for many years, a very active and useful citizen, and died in 1727. On the death of his father, although young, Jo seph Blanchard was chosen proprietor's clerk, which office he held, with a slight interval, during his life, and was constantly engaged in town business until his death. In early life he became distinguished as a surveyor of land, and was almost constantly employed in (hat capacity. \u2014 In conjunction with Rev. Dr. Langdon, of Ports mouth, he projected a map of New Hampshire, which was published after his death, in 1761, and inscribed to \"Hon. Charles Townsend. his Majesty's Secretary of War.\" At this period no accurate maps of the State existed, and to prepare one from the then scanty materials must have been a work of great mag nitude. Surveys were to be made, and informa tion collected from every quarter. Most of the labor, of course, fell on Col. Blanchard. The greater part of our territory was then a wilder ness, for our whole population scarcely exceeded 50,000, and the means of intercommunication were limited and difficult. But settlements were springing up rapidly, and the lands were be coming every day more and more valuable, and accurate^ information of the localities was im portant. Under these circumstances the map was considered of great value, and as a token of their estimate of it, Mr. Townsend procured from the University of Glasgow, for Mr. Lang don, (Col. Blanchard having deceased,) the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity. (1.) (1.) I Belknap. 312."], [195, "165 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, kC. Upon the dissolution of the connexion between New Hampshire and Massachusetts in 1741, and the accession of Benning Wentworth as Gov ernor, Mr. Blanchard received the appointment of Counsellor of State by mandamus from the Crown. This was an office of great dignity and authority, and next to that of Governor, was the most honorable and responsible in the colonies, in the gift of the king. This office he held for a number of years, and probably until his death. In 1749, on the death of Chief Justice Jaffrey, he was appointed a Judge of the Superior Court of Judicature of the State, which office he held during life. When the old French War broke out in 1755, an expedition was planned against Crown Point. New Hampshire raised a regiment of 500 men, and Mr. Blanchard was appointed Colonel. Of this regiment, the famous Rangers, under the command of Rogers and Stark, formed a part. The regiment was stationed at Fort Edward, and returned home in the autumn of the same year. Col. Blanchard married Rebecca Hubbard, [Hobart?] by whom he had twelve children. \u2014 He died in this town and is buried in the Old South Burying Ground ; his tombstone bears the following inscription: \u2014 \"The Hon.

Protests were entered at every meeting by the minority, as each party in turn prevailed. In 1759, in consequence of the divisions and the bitterness of feeling which existed, an Eccle siastical Council was called to settle the difficul ties. For many years there had been two chur ches and two meeting-houses, but no minister. \u2014 After much trouble and effort, a compromise was made, and an union effected. Mr. Bird's meet ing house was purchased by Jona. Lovewell, re moved, and converted into a dwelling house, which is now occupied by Jesse Bowers, Esq., and the two societies again became one. As the town at its public meetings settled and paid the minister, so it determined his creed, and we find accordingly, the following to us curious record. In 1761, a town meeting was called ex pressly \"to see what doctrines the town would support\"; and it was voted, \"that the Doctrines contained in the New England Confession of Faith are the standing doctrines to be defended by this Town.\" July 19, 1762, an invitation was given to Mr. Jonathan Livermore to settle here. He was to receive \u00a3100, for a settlement, and \u00a340 sterling per annum salary, \" if he will fulfil the duties of a Gospel minister agreeably to the Congregation al persuasion, according to Cambridge Platform, and New England Confession of Faith.\" This proviso was adopted by a party vote, and was a renewal of the old sectarian difficulties of past years. Mr. Livermore would not accept and af terward settled in Wilton. During the next two years various preachers were heard, but not to general satisfaction.

A call was then given to Mr. Thomas Fessenden, (a graduate of Harvard college in 1750,) and an offer of \u00a3100 settlement, and \u00a350 sterling salary. Against this call three separate protests were entered by per sons styling themselves \"Presperterions,\" or Pres byterians, because this mode of settlement was \"contrary to the fundamental doctrines of Chris tianity,\" and \" of our persuasion.\" Mr. Fes senden accepted the call, but such was the spirit of discord that he was never ordained. He left town very soon after, for he commenced a suit at law against the town, for the recovery of hit salary before May, 1765, and recovered judgment. For nearly twenty years the town had been without a settled minister. Sept, 12, 1766, they gave a call to Mr. Joseph Kidder, (a graduate of Yale College in 1764,) and offered him \u00a3132 6s 8d. [about $450,] for a settlement, and a salary of \u00a353 6s. 8d. lawful money, [or about $180. j Mr. Kidder accepted the invitation, and more fortunate than his predecessors, succeeded in being ordained March 18, 1767. After many years old difficulties revived, and new ones arose. \u2014 Parties were again formed, and in 1796, by a reference of all disputes to a committee mutually chosen, the civil connection between Mr. Kiddei and the town, ceased. He was the last minister over the town. He continued his relation to tht church, however, as before, and preached to his society until his death, Sept. 6, 1818. Nov. 3, 1818, Rev. Ebenezer P. Sperry was ordained as his colleague, but was dismissed in April, 1819.

To sketch such a picture would require the hand of a master, as well as materials, which can now hardly be obtained. A few facts and anecdotes must serve instead. Slavery was then considered neither illegal nor immoral. Several slaves were owned in this town : one by Paul Clogstone. She was married to a free black named Castor Dickinson, and had several children born here, but before the Revo lution he purchased the freedom of his wife and children. Slavery in New Hampshire was abol ished by the Revolution. In those days it was customary to drink at all meetings, whether of joy or of sorrow. The idea which was long after in vogue \u2014 \"to keep the spirits up, by pouring spirits down \" \u2014 seems to have been then universally prevalent. Even at funerals it was observed, and in the eyes of many it was quite as important as the prayer. \u2014 The mourners and friends formed themselves in a line, and an attendant with a jug and glass passed around, and dealt out to each his or her portion of the spirit ; and the due observance of this ceremony was very rarely omitted. It is said that sometimes \" one more thirsty than the rest,\" after having received one \" portion,\" would slily fall back from the line, under some pretext or other, and re-appear in a lower place, in season to receive a second portion.

From the commencement of our Revolutionary difficulties, a deep and universal feeling of indig nation pervaded the community. The men who had settled in the wilderness, and defended their homes from the attack of the \" Indian enemy,\" and had built them up a great and goodly her itage, unaided by stepdame England, were not the men quietly to yield up their dear bought rights without a struggle. Their love for the mother country was never very strong, for there was little cause for gratitude, and the first ap proach of oppression and wrong was the signal for resistance. This feeling was stronger in New England than in the other colonies, and manifest ed itself, at an earlier period, because the Puri tans, having been forced to leave their Father land by oppression and insult, and having made for themselves a new home in the wilderness, unassisted and unprotected, felt it a more grievous and insufferable wrong, that England should seize upon the first moment of prosperity, to heap upon them new oppression and new insults here. The division of New England into townships, \u2014 those \" little democracies \" as they were aptly called, \u2014 each self-governed, where every citizen feels that he is a part of the commonwealth, has municipal rights and duties, and learns to think and act for himself, was an excellent school"], [200, "170 HISTORY OF for training up the Fathers of our Republic, and teaching them the principles of self-government upon a more extended scale. During the long succession of encroachments, which preceded and caused the Revolution, the inhabitants of this town were not indifferent. \u2014 They had watched the storm as it gathered, and knew its consequences must be momentous. \u2014 After the establishment of the boundary line in 1741, which severed us from Massachusetts, no right to send a representative was conceded for many years. At that period this right was a favor granted by his majesty, through his \" be loved, and trust-worthy Benning Wentworth, Governor of his Majesty's Province of New Hampshire,\" and bestowed only upon the loyal and obedient. In 1774, however, when a colli sion with England began to be very generally expected, the General Assembly of New Hamp shire claimed for itself the exercise of this right, and allowed certain representatives from towns not heretofore represented a seat and a voice in their councils. Immediately a petition was pre sented from this town, asking the privilege of representation, which was granted. (1.) September, 1774, Jonathan Lovewell was sent as a delegate to the Convention, which met at Exeter soon after, for the purpose of choosing delegates to the First Continental Congress. \u2014 At the same town meeting the town voted to raise a sum of money \" to purchase a supply of ammunition \" ; and also voted to pay their pro portion of the \"expenses of the Delegate to the Grand Continental Congress,\" which met at Philadelphia the same month, and which pub lished a Declaration of Rights, and formed an (1.) 2 Province Papers.

January 9, 1775, Joseph Ayers and Noah Lovewell were chosen to represent the town in the Convention which met at Exeter, April 25, 1775, for the purpose of appointing delegates, to act for this State in the Grand Continental Con gress, to be held at Philadelphia, May 10, 1775. At this meeting, with a spirit characteristic of the times, and evidently anticipating a Declara tion of Independence, they chose \" Saml. Roby, Jona. Lovewell, Joseph Eayers, Benjamin Smith, John Wright, Benjamin French, James Blanchard and John Searle, a Committee of Inspection to see that the Result of the late Continental Con gress be carried into practice, and that all persons in this town conform themselves thereto.\" Another meeting of this Convention was holden at Exeter, May 17, 1775; at which the same delegates attended, and which after several ad- journments, formed a Constitution for the Gov ernment of the State. This Constitution, which is dated January 5, 1776, was the earliest one formed in the United States. (1.) It was adopted at the suggestion of the Continental Congress of May, 1775 ; but it was a bold step, for it was a denial of the right of England to rule over us, and a virtual Declaration of Independence. It provided for a House of Representatives, and a Council of twelve men to be chosen by the House. and to form a separate body like our Senate. \u2014 There was to be no Governor, but the powers of the executive were vested in the Council and House jointly. If the dispute with England continued longer than one year, the members of the Council were to be chosen by the people. (1.) iN.H.Hist. Coll. *15"], [202, "172 HISTORY OF Of this Council, Jona. Blanchard of this town, was a member in 1776. From the first the people of New Hampshire, who as the royalists complained, \" had never set any good example of obedience,\" were desirous and prepared for a collision ; and no sooner did the news of the fight at Lexington on the nineteenth of April, 1775, reach the State, than the whole population rushed to arms. In these movements the citizens of Dunstable were among the most zealous ; and the military spirit derived from their fathers, and the military experience of many in the French Wars, was roused at once into activity by the noise of the conflict. Instantly they hur ried to Concord to avenge the blood of their fel iow-cilizens. Who and how many were these \"minute men\" we do not know ; but the town paid over $110.00 for their expenses. Within less than a week a company of sixty-six men was organized at Cambridge, under Capt. Wm.

From no other town in New Hampshire was there so large a number in the army, as appears by the returns; and we record a fact, so honorable to their patriotism and cour age, with a seeling of no little pride. The Convention which met at Exeter, April 25, 1775, a few days after the fight at Lexington, organized two regiments, for the assistance of their brethren in Massachusetts. But the men were not to be recruited ; the$: were already in the field.

Poor, joined the army at Cam bridge. Previous to the battle the New Hampshire troops were stationed at Medford, and formed the left wing of the American Army. \" These troops,\" says Major Swett, (1.) \" were hardy, brave, active, athletic and indefatigable. Al most every soldier equalled William Tell as a marksman, and could aim his weapon at an op pressor with as keen a relish. Those from the frontiers had gained this address against the sav ages and beasts of the forests. The country yet abounded with game, and hunting was familiar to all ; and the amusement most fashionable and universal throughout New England was trial of skill with the musket.\" At eleven o'clock on the morning of the battle, the New Hampshire troops received orders to reinforce Col. Prescott, at Charlestown. \"About fifteen charges of loose powder and balls were distributed to each man, and they were directed to form them into cartridges immediately. Few of the men, however, possessed cartridge boxes, but employed powder horns, and scarcely two of their guns agreeing in calibre, they were obliged to alter the balls accordingly.\" (2.)

To be stationed there, in j the post of danger, was a high honor, and well did the New Hampshire troops merit it, although i not a few paid for the distinction with their lives. As soon as the British moved forward to the attack, our troops under Stark, engaged in forti fying Bunker Hill under the direction of Putnam, joined their brethren. The battle commenced. \u2014 The Americans, forbidden to fire upon the enemy until \" they could see the whites of their eyes,\" swept them down by companies. Again and again were the British driven back, and not until their scanty supply of ammunition was exhaust ed, and the British assaulted the works at the point of the bayonet, did the Americans retire from their position. Even then they retreated like the lion, disputing every step with stones and clubbed muskets, and lay upon their arms during the night at Winter Hill, directly in the face of the enemy. The number of Americans engaged in the battle was fluctuating, but may be fairly estimated at little more than two thousand men. Their loss was 115 killed, 305 wounded, and 30 cap tured ; in all 450. The New Hampshire regi ments lost 19 men killed, and 74 wounded, a large proportion of those engaged. The British loss was 1054, including S9 officers.

A large number of delegates were present, and Dunstable was represented by Capt. Benjamin French, Capt. Noah Lovewell and Joseph Eayrs.

[n March, 1777, the town offered a bounty of one hundred dollars to every soldier who would enlist, and a large number joined the army. Be sides those already mentioned, we find the follow ing : \u2014 Jonathan Emerson, Lieutenant in Cil!ey:s regiment ; James Blanchard. Quarter-Master in ScammeFs regiment; John Butler and James Harwood killed at Hubberton, Vt. July 7, 1777, on the retreat from Ticonderoga, John Manning taken prisoner there, and afterwards re-taken ; Simeon Butterfield, David Alld, Israel Ingalls, John Lund, William Gibbs, Paul Woods. Elipha let Manning, John Manning, James Seal, Isaac Adams, Noah Downs, Jeremiah Keith who served in a Massachusetts regiment; Ephraim Blood, William Mann and John Crocker, in the Artillery corps. Just before the battle of Saratoga, Lt. Alld returned for volunteers, and a large number from this town and vicinity hastened to join the army, and arrived in season to compel and wit ness the surrender of Burgoyne. In November, 1777, the town voted to raise \" \u00a3735 lawful money to defray the extraordinary expenses of the present war.\" (I.) The regiment of militia to which Dunstable was attached, was then commanded by Col. Moses Nichols, of Amherst. It em- braced the following towns, containing the number of males between the ages of sixteen and fifty, in each respectively: \u2014 Amherst 321 ; Nottingham West [Hudson] 122; Litehfield 57; Dunstable 128; Merrimac 129 j Hollis 234 ; Wilton 12S ; Rindge 20 ; Mason 113.\u2014 [ This was the basis for all drafts of soldiers for the army.

The Legislature was itself the Executive, and upon every adjournment, therefore, it became necessary to give to some body the power of acting in case of emergency during the recess. This power was voted in a Committee of Safety, varying in number from six to sixteen, composed of the wisest, best, and most active men in the different sections of the State, and those who had shown themselves the truest friends of their country. Their duty was like that of the Roman Dictators \u2014 \" ne quid I Respublica detriment! caperet\" \u2014 to take care I that the Republic received no injury ; and a cor- responding power to effect this object was given them. Of this most responsible committee, two members belonged to this town. Jonathan Love | well was a member from June 20, 1777, to Janu | ary 5, 1779, and Jonathan Blanchard from Jan- uary 6, 1778. (1.)

After the Declaration of Independence, which was the abolition of all existing government, it became necessary to form some plan of Govern- ment, both for the State and the Union. The people in their primary assemblies had com- menced and carried on the Revolution, and they entered with the same zeal into the discussion of their political rights and duties, and the best mode of preserving and perpetuating them. \u2014 February 9, 1778, in town meeting, \" the arti- cles of Confederation formed by the Honorable Continental Congress having been taken into consideration were consented to unanimously.\" April 17, 1778, Capt. Benjamin French, and Dea. William Hunt were chosen delegates to the Convention, which was to be holden June 10, 1778, for the purpose of forming a Constitu- tion for the State. We may see with what jealousy the people watched their servants, and regarded the powers of Government, from the fact that they appointed a committee of eleven, viz.: Cyrus Baldwin, Joseph Whiting, Robert Fletcher, Esq., Jonathan Lovewell, Esq., Capt. Daniel Warner, Joseph Eayrs, Capt. Benjamin Smith, Lieut. David Alld, Col. Noah Lovewell, Lieut. Joseph French, and Lieut. Jacob Taylor \" to assist said members during the Convention's session.\" So early was the right of instruction claimed, practised, and acknowledged. A Bill of Rights and a Constitution was drafted ac cordingly, and an able Address to the People issued, signed by John Langdon, President of the Convention. But the people would not sanc tion either. Their experience of royal usurpa tion, and the fear of giving too much power to their rulers prevailed, and both were negatived"], [213, "183 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, kC. by a great majority. This town \" voted unani mously to reject them.\" In August, fourteen men went from this town to Rhode Island, as volunteers, with Col. Noah Love ivell. The town voted to pay them a bounty of about thirty-five dollars each. Of this num ber were James Jewell, Eleazer Fisk, Isaac Foot, and others. During this year a very large num ber of soldiers from this town were in the army in New York and at the South. In December, 1778, Col. Noah Lovewell was chosen \" Representative for one year,\" being the first representative elected by the town under the Constitution. How many soldiers were furnished to the army from this town during that long and bloody struggle, it is impossible now to ascertain with correctness, but the number continued to be very large during the war. It is estimated that New Hampshire sent to the army at various times, 14,000 men, a number nearly equal to the whole able-bodied population of the State at the com mencement of the wars, and of whom 4,000 died in the service. The whole male population of this town in May, 1775, between the ages of sixteen and fifty years, was only 128, and nearly every inhabitant, either as a volunteer upon an alarm, or as a drafted man, was at some period in the service. They were in almost every fight from Bunker Hill to Yorktown, and their bones are moulder ing upon many a battle field from Massachusetts to Virginia. When the news of \"the Concord FighV'' flew hither on the wings of the wind, our \"minute men\" saddled their horses and hastened to the scene of conflict, and, although they did not reach there in season to share in its dangers, they formed a portion of that fiery mass *16"], [214, "184 HISTORY OF of undisciplined valor which \" hung upon the KJL UUUlOLipilllUU \u00bb uu-'i \u00bb\u00bb Jii-ii ti liii_ uj/un tuw steps of the retreating foe like lightning on the edge of the cloud.\" They were at Bunker Hill in the post of danger and honor, and shared largely in the glory of that day. They were at Ticonderoga, where, borne down by sickness, by pestilence, and by want, they were compelled i to retreat, fighting step by step, in the face of a j victorious enemy. They were at Bennington, j under Stark, where the first gleam of light broke \u2022 in upon the darkness which was lowering over our prospects, cheering every heart to new efforts, and at Stillwater and Saratoga, where this first omen of victory was converted into a triumph most glorious and enduring. They wintered at Valley Forge with Wash- ington, where, \" without shoes or stockings, their pathway might be tracked by their blood.\" \u2014 They were at Trenton and Princeton, where. under the very eye of Washington, they surprised : and captured the Hessians, and gave new hope and courage to the disheartened nation. They fought at Germantown and Monmouth, and at the memorable conflicts on Long Island. At Mon- mouth, the New Hampshire regiment, under Cilley and Dearborn, was \" the most distinguish- ed, and to their heroic courage the salvation of the army was owing.\" General Washington ac ; knowledged the service, and sent to enquire what regiment it was. \"'Pull blooded Yankees, by G-d, sir,\" was the blunt reply of Dearborn. \u2014 And at Yorktown, when the whole British army capitulated, they were there with Scammel, a glorious and fitting finale to the great Revolu- tionary drama, whose opening scene was at Lexington. Of those who, during this long period, when the fears of even the stout-hearted prevailed over"], [215, "185 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, kC. their hopes, and darkness seemed resting upon their freedom, rallied around the standard of their country, and perilled \" their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honour \" in its defence. few \u2014 very few \u2014 now survive, the shadows only of their manhood. It is no easy task even to collect their names, and they ought not to be for gotten. They were in humble station, and fa miliarity may have reduced them in the eyes of the present age ; yet their service was no holiday sport, and to them, their exertions, and their sufferings, do we all owe the birth-right of our liberty. From the records of the town, and musty papers on file; from Legislative Journals; from company and regimental returns in the of fice of the Secretary of Stale ; from vouchers and loose memoranda accidentally preserved, \u2014 and from personal enquiry of the survivors and de scendants of the actors, we have gathered with no little care and labor, a portion of their names. Some of them sound strangely in our ears, but most of them are known positively to have been in the service, and are called of this town. (1.)

We can form but a faint idea of the sacrifices which were made for Independence. Beside perilling life in battle and submitting to priva tions of every description, so large a proportion of the able-bodied population were in the army, that the fields were often left unfilled. Yet they gave both time and treasure to their country, without, measure and without a murmur. \"Our efforts are great,\" Mr. Adams said in 1780, \" and we give this campaign more than half our prop erty to defend the other. He who stays at home cannot earn enough to pay him who takes the field.\" (1.) The amount annually expended by the town, during the war, was several thousand dollars; \u2014 a heavy burden upon a population, numbering in 1775, only 705. Yet this small number had diminished, in 1783, to 578, shewing a decrease of 127, or IS per cent.; a fact which proves better than pages of description, the amount of the exertions which were put forth, and the sacrifices which were made, and the consequent paralysis of the energies and pros perity of the community. In 1781, another Convention was holden at Concord, for the purpose of forming a State Con stitution ; and Jonathan Lovewell, Esq., was (1.)

But the same jealousy continued to exist as heretofore, and the new Constitution, which was our present one with slight modifications, was rejected by the town \" unanimously.\" In December, 1782, Jonathan Blanchard, Esq., was chosen Representative, and it was again voted \" not to receive the Bill of Rights and Plan of Government \" as adopted, and the town chose Capt. Benjamin French, Jo seph Whiting, Jonathan Lovewell, Esq., and Col. Noah Lovewell, a committee to state the reasons of rejection. March, 1784, Capt. Benjamin French was chosen Representative. March 6, 1786, Col. Noah Lovewell was cho sen Representative, and the town voted, that \" the Selectmen with Jona. Blanchard, Esqr., Jonathan Lovewell, Esqr., Mr. Joseph Whiting and Deacon William Hunt be a committee to give instructions to the Representatives.\" In 1787, the same proceedings were renewed. January 10, 1788, Dea. William Hunt was chosen a delegate to the Convention, which met at Exeter in February of the same year, to consider of, and adopt, the Constitution of the United States, which had recently been formed and sent out for the approval of the people. Throughout the country, as well as in the Convention, which formed it, there was a great diversity of opinion respecting it, and much opposition. It contained no bill of rights as it now does ; as its opposers thought no limitation of powers. The States had long been sovereign and independent democ racies, and hesitated to give up any of their rights. The confederation had been inefficient from the want of central authority. Thus, while some believed that the Constitu tion vested too much power in the General Gov-"], [218, "188 HISTORY OF eminent, which would eventually swallow up the several States, others seared that it possessed too little power to protect itself from the en croachments of the States ; and would soon share the fate of the old confederacy. There was danger on both sides : on the one side anarchy \u2014 on the other usurpation. It was an untried ex periment, and every little community was di vided. It was discussed in town meeting, and the town voted \" not to accept said Constitution,'' and chose a committee of nine to give their dele gates instruction to oppose its adoption by the Convention. This committee reported a list of objections, which were adopted by the town, and forwarded to the Convention. The Constitution. however, was adopted. It was a medium and a compromise, between the doubts of conflicting parties, and the fears of both have happily proved vain. July 16, 17SS, died Hon. Jonathan Blanchard. aged 50 years. He was the son of Col. Joseph Blanchard, and was born September 18, 1738. \u2014 He had not the advantage of a collegiate educa tion, but was early initiated, by his father, into the active business of life. After the death of his father, which occurred in his 20th year, he was called upon to fill his place as proprietors1 clerk and surveyor, and was soon deeply engaged in the management of town affairs, and other public business. When the events which preceded the revolu tion occurred, the people of New Hampshire were among the first to resist the usurpations of the crown. When in 1685, Cranfield forbade the ministers to preach, unless they would administer the communion to all who requested it, in the Episcopal form, they refused obedience, denounc ed him from the pulpit, and went to prison rather"], [219, "189 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, kC. than yield. When the Governor at a later day, levied a tax upon the lands of the people, for his private advantage, the women resisted the col lection, and drove his officers from their houses with water scalding hot. The '\u2022''broad R\" cut by some \"prowling official,\" upon their choicest trees, thus devoting them to the Royal Navy, without redress or compensation, was a continued eye-sore. Early in 1775, the legislature of New Hamp shire, first of all the States, and evidently antici pating Independence, sent a request to the Con tinental Congress, which met at Philadelphia, May 10, 1775, to advise them as to the organiza tion of an Independent Government. Agreeably to their recommendation, given with much hesi tation, (1.) a Convention met at Exeter, and adopted a Constitution, bearing date January 5, 1776. It was the earliest adopted by any colony, and was violently opposed by the more timid, as a virtual Declaration of Independence. (2.) It provided, as has before been mentioned, for a House of Delegates, and a Council of twelve, to be elected annually by the people, and which were similar to our Senate and House of Repre sentatives. No provision was made for a Gov ernor, and the whole Executive, as well as Leg islative, authority was placed in these two bodies. Of this Council, Jonathan Blanchard was chosen a member in 1776, and continued such for three years. No better testimony to his worth could be given than the bestowal of such an office at such a period. In October, 1776, Gen. Blanchard was sent by the Legislature to recruit our regiments, which had been wasted by sickness, suffering, and de- (1.) Mrs. Adams's Letters, 85. 2 Gordon's History, 1 50.

(3.) In 1784, soon after the adoption of our State Constitution, Gen. Blanchard was ap pointed Judge of Probate for the County of Hills borough, an office which he held nearly or quite up to the time of his death. In 1787, during the confederation of the States, he was elected a delegate from this State to the Continental Congress. They were chosen annu ally, and whether he was again elected and died in office is uncertain. (4.) Soon after the death of his father he was appointed agent, by the Masonian Proprietors, to manage and dispose of all the unsettled lands within the State of New Hampshire. The territory of this State had been granted originally, to Robert Mason, but after many years, finding that it yielded very little income and caused him much trouble, he disposed of the land, as far as it remained in his possession, to a company of individuals who were called the Masonian Proprietors.

Gen. Blanchard died in this town and is buried in the Old South burying ground. He married Rebecca Farwell. who died August 20, 1811, and left five children, one only of whom is now living. In 1790, the population of the town was 632. In 1792, died Jonathan Lovewell, Esq., aged 79. He was a brother of Capt. Lovewell, \" The Indian Fighter,\" and of Col. Zaccheus LtfVewell, and was born in this town, May 14, 1713. Earltr in life he took an active part in town affairs, and became one of the proprietors of \"common lands \" in the township of Dunstable. For many years he was proprietor's clerk, and a magistrate under the crown. About the year 1746, under the preaching of Rev. Mr. Kirk, he became a convert to the doctrine of the \"New Lights,\" as the followers of Whitefield were then called, and soon after became a preacher. This probably, however, was of short duration, as he never left town, and in 1755, he was commissary of the New Hampshire regiment, sent out against Crown Point, under the command of Col. Joseph Blanch ard. A gun taken from the French during that campaign, and brought home by him, is still in the possession of the family. In the earliest stages of the Revolution, Mr. Lovewell was an ardent and efficient friend of liberty. In April, 1774, he was chosen agent of the town to petition the General Court for leave to send a Representative, a privilege which they had not hitherto enjoyed.

January 9, 1775, Mr. Lovewell was chosen a member of the \"Committee of Inspection \" for the town, to see that none of the inhabitants purchased or used British Goods. February, 1776, he was chosen a member of the \" Commit tee of Safety \" for the town, a situation of no little trust, and continued a member of almost every such Revolutionary committee during the war. These committees were of the highest utility in diffusing information, and in exciting and concentrating the efforts of the patriotic, and demanded men of great energy and decision. \u2014 June 20, 1777, he was chosen a member of the \"Committee of Safety\" for the State, and served in that capacity until January 5, 1779. about which period the necessity for the exercise of their functions in a great measure ceased. April, 1778, he was chosen a member of the Committee to \"assist\" the delegates from this town in the Convention for framing a Constitution for the State.

It was slowly recovering from the effects of the war, and its exhausting sacrifices. About 1795 the first stage coach was put upon this road, and was an occasion of great public inter est. It was a two horse covered vehicle, owned and driven by Mr. Joseph Wheat, and ran from Amherst to Boston and back again once a week. It stopped at Billerica over night, making the trip both ways in about four days. They had not then learned the advantages of changing horses, and the same team performed all the journey. People came from a distance of sever al miles to look at \" the stage\" and gaze upon it with the same seeling of wonder that they now do upon a locomotive engine. About this time the locks and canal around Pawtucket Falls were built, and boating upon the Merrimac began. At this time there were no dwellings where our village now stands, and but one or two at the Harbor. In 1800 the population of Dunstable had in creased to 862. In the spring of 1803 a Canal Boat was built in the village, by Robert Fletcher, Esq. It was a singular structure, having sides five or six feet in height all around it, and doors,"], [226, "194 HISTORY OF and was looked upon as \"a wonder.\" It was the first canal boat ever built in this vicinity for the regular transportation of goods, and the fact was considered of as much importance to the infant village as the opening of a railroad at the present day. It was launched on the Fourth of July, which was celebrated by a public meeting, and an oration by Daniel Abbot, Esq. (1.) \u2014 There was a great gathering of the people, and great rejoicing. Already was it a place of some trade, and the more sanguine saw in imagination its trade and population doubled or even trebled. The landing was on the Merrimac near the mouth of the Nashua, and a store was there erected. \u2014 The boat was christened \"the Nashua,\" with much parade, and the village which had until then been called \"Indian Head\" received the name of Nashua Village. (2.) That may be (1.) This oration was printed. (2.) This same is found in Winthrop's Journal, both in ils present usual orthography and in other forms, as applied to an early settle ment on the Nashua river, now Lancaster, Massachusetts.

Let us endeavor to picture to ourselves Nashua Village as it appeared July 4th, 1803. A large, one story dwelling house stood on the site of the Indian Head Coffee House, (of which it now forms a part) and was kept as a tavern by Timo thy Taylor, Esq. A large, one story store, owned and conducted by Robert Fletcher, who resided in Amherst, stood where Kendrick & Tuttle's store now stands. Abbot and Fox's office was a dwelling house occupied by \"uncle\" John Lund, his brother and sisters. A dwelling house, three stories in front and two in rear, had just been erected by Mr. Fletcher, but was then unfinished. It stood on the north-east corner of Main and Franklin streets, opposite the Bap tist meeting house, and here upon a temporary platform the oration was delivered. The Amherst and Concord roads with Main street, and a road down the northern bank of the Nashua to the Boating house and Ferries were all the highways then existing. At the Harbor the dwelling house of Gen. Noah Lovewell, now occupied by Hon. Jesse Bowers, with two other small houses on the south side of Salmon Brook, were the only buildings. As the greater part of the inhabitants lived west and south of this, the meeting house was built on the little triangle in front of Silas Gibson's house. Here was the largest village in town, a tavern, store, shops, and dwellings, and here resi ded the physician and the lawyer, (Mr. Abbot.) But in September, 1803, the \"Old Tontine,\" the long, low, building at the head of Main street, in Nashville, was built, and soon after occupied by Mr. Abbot, (who removed here Dec. 1, 1803 ; ) Dr. Elias Maynard, physician; Dea. James Pat- *17"], [228, "196 HISTORY OF terson, bookbinder, and a Mr. Clements, saddler. There was no dam across the Nashua, and its waters flowed far down its natural channel over its rocky bed. The \"pilgrims\" who then set tled here must have seen some light from the future breaking through the surrounding dark ness, for there was not a building between Salmon Brook and Nashua river, and a broad, unfenced, desolate, white-pine forest spread in every direc tion beyond. In 1803 a Post Office was first established in town, and Gen. Noah Lovewell appointed Post Master. Previously letters for this town were re ceived from the Post Office at Tyngsborough. (1.) In 1804 a farther impulse was given to the growth and business of the village by the com pletion and opening of the Middlesex canal. \u2014 This opened a direct channel of communication with Boston, and rendered the place, as the head of navigation, one of considerable trade. Hith erto the principal markets of this region had been Haverhill and Newburyport. From this period the growth of the settlement was gradual, but constant. The whole plain. upon which the village stands, was covered with its native growth of pines, and was considered generally of but very little value. \"Dunstable Plains\" were often the subject of much merri ment, and seemed to some the embodiment of the idea of poverty of soil. It is said that some wicked wag, in our Legislature, once undertook to disparage our soil, declaring that \"it would not support one chipping squirrel to the acre :\" but this, as well as the story that \" a grasshopper was once seen perched upon the top of a dry mullen stalk, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, looking in vain to discover one stalk of (1.) See history of the Post Office in Appendix."], [229, "197 I NASHUA, NASHVILLE, &C green grass,\" is a grievous slander, and a device of the enemy. The soil of our plains was, indeed, naturally sandy and barren, and of little value for culti vation when other and more desirable locations for tillage were scattered all around. From this circumstance, we may believe the statement to be quite credible, that the rise of Main street from the Bridge over Nashua river, to the present place of Messrs. Kendrick &, Tuttle's store in Nashville, was \" the worst hill between Amherst and Boston.\" We must remember, however, hat a great change has taken place in its appear ance aud situation. The present bridge is raised some twenty or twenty-five feet above the old one, the water under the present bridge being not the natural stream, but a pond occasioned by the dam at Indian Head, and many feet in depth. \u2014 While the bridge has been raised many feet and the road filled in accordingly, the slope of the hill on either side of the river has been cut down. and graded, so that the ascent now, in either direction, is comparatively slight. In 1812, the old meeting house, which stood in the little square in front of the Gibson tavern, and which had been standing there more than sixty years, had become too old and dilapidated to answer the purposes of its erection. A new and more costly house was built accordingly, nearly half a mile northerly of the old one. \u2014 This is the one now called \" the Old South,\" and was dedicated November 4, 1812, upon which occasion the sermon was preached by Rev. Hum phrey Moore, of Milford. (I.) November 3, 1813, Rev. Ebenezer P. Sperry was ordained, as the colleague of Rev. Mr. Kid der. He remained in Dunstable until April, (1.) This sermon was printed."], [230, "198 HISTORY OF 1819, when he was dismissed, and has been Chap lain of the House of Correction, at South Boston. During his ministry, September 6, 1818, Rev. Mr. Kidder died, aged 77, on which occasion a discourse was delivered by Rev. H. Moore. (I.) About 1817, a dam was thrown across Nashua river, a few rods above Main street ; a Grist-mill erected at one end of it by Dea. James Patter son, and a saw-mill at the other by Willard Marshall. Some time after, another dam was built near the spot, where the present dam of the Jackson Company stands, and a mill erected. \u2014 At this time the village had increased so much that it contained about a dozen or twenty houses, and being a central thoroughfare had become a place of considerable business. The population of the town was 1,142. In 1820, v#ien the census was taken, there were returned from Dunstable : 1 meetinghouse; 9 school districts and school houses; 6 taverns; 5 stores; 3 saw mills: 3 grist mills ; 1 clothing mill; 1 carding machine; 2 bark mills; 3 tan neries. Soon after 1820, public attention began to be turned towards manufactures. Many years pre viously Judge Tyng, of Tyngsborough, in a conversatiou with George Sullivan, predicted that the valley of the Merrimac would be a great manufacturing region, and he pointed out the locations at Lowell, at Nashua, and at Amos keag.

The leading citizens of the town seem to have been pecu liarly far-sighted, public spirited, and energetic, and the manufacturing capacities of Nashua river did not escape their notice. The idea, which first suggested itself, was that of building mills at Mine Falls ; the water power was great, and a saw mill had been erected there at a very early period, probably before 1700. It was not, however, for some time that the idea occurred to them of erecting the mills upon their present location, and building up a village here, by bringing the water from Mine Falls by means of a canal. It was a great undertaking, and of doubtful result, but a survey was made, and its practicability ascertained. The few individuals, who had conceived the idea, formed an association, and in 1822 and 1823, purchased the greater portion of the lands in and around the village, and up to the Falls. \u2014 In June, 1823, a charter was granted to Daniel Abbot, Moses Tyler, Joseph Greeley, and others, by the name of the \" Nashua Manufacturing Company,\" with a right to increase their capital to one million dollars. The capital stock was at first fixed by them at $300,000 ; and was divided into three hundred shares, of $1,000 each. Of these Daniel Webster took 60 shares ; Daniel Ab bot 30 shares; J., E. & A. Greeley 30 shares ; Augustus Peabody 75 shares ; Benj. F. French 30 shares ; Foster & Kendrick 30 shares ; John Kendrick 15 shares ; Moses Tyler 30 shares. In 1824, a considerable portion of the stock was disposed of to capitalists, and the works were commenced. The dam at Mine Falls was built, and the excavation of the canal began under the superintendence of Col. James F. Bald-"], [232, "200 HISTORY OF I win. This canal, which supplies the water for the factories of the Nashua Manufacturing Com pany, is about three miles in length, 60 feet wide, and 6 feet deep, and affords a head and fall of about 33 feet. Ira Gay, Esq., was also engaged as machinist, and Col. William Boardman as wheel-wright and engineer ; and the first Factory was commenced. December 25, 1824, the Ma chine Shop was completed and went into opera tion. The works advanced. Mill No. 1, of the Nashua Corporation was erected and went into partial operation in December, 1825, and into full operation in 1826. In December, 1824, a charter was obtained by the Nashua Manufacturing Company for the pur pose of building \" a canal with the necessary dams and locks \" to connect the Nashua with the Merrimac. They were built in 1825, and opened for the transportation of goods in the spring of 1826. The lower dam across the Nashua was built at this time. The Locks are of solid stone, 24 feet high ; each lift being ten feet wide and eighty-two long. They were built under the su perintendence of Col. Baldwin, and cost $20,000. The canal dam cost a further sum of $10,000. \u2014 This canal was of very great advantage to the rising village, which was now becoming the cen tre of business for the neighboring towns, by af fording such increased facilities for the transpor tation of goods and produce, and its beneficial effects were soon sensibly felt in the increase of trade and enterprise. In May 1825, a portion of the lower water priv ilege, now occupied by the Jackson Company, was sold by the Nashua Manufacturing Compa ny to Charles C. Haven and others, who were incorporated by the name of the \" Indian Head Company,\" for the purpose of erecting Woollen"], [233, "NASHUA, NASHVILLE, &C 201 Factories. Their works were commenced imme diately, and went into operation in 1826, under the agency of Mr. Haven. In 1825, the meeting house, now occupied by Rev. Mr. Richards's Society, was erected by the Nashua Company ; and November 8th. 1826, Rev. Handel G. Nott was settled over the church and society, which had been destitute since the dis mission of Mr. Sperry, a period of eighteen years. In 1834 the society was divided, in consequence of a change in the sentiments of their pastor, and the church, in its organized capacity, under the name of the \"First Congregational Church iu Nashua,\" left the meeting house in possession of Rev. Mr. Nott's society, and worshipped for a time in Greeley's Hall. They invited Rev. Jon athan McGee to become their pastor, and his in stallation took place January 1, 1835. During the same year a spacious meeting house was erected at an expense of more than $10,000. \u2014 June 8th. 1842, Mr. McGee was dismissed and Rev. Matthew Hale Smith was installed October 19th. of the same year. Mr. Smith was dismiss ed August 20th. 1845, and Rev. Samuel Lamson, the present pastor, was installed April Sth. 1846. This church consists of 450 members, and has connected with it a Sabbath school, which usual ly numbers more than 300 scholars. There is a library for the use of the school. There are two benevolent societies sustained by the ladies, a Maternal Society and a Young Men's Missionary Association. Contributions are annually taken up in aid of the following objects : the Foreign and Home Missionary, the Education, Bible. Tract and Seaman's Friend Societies, with other occasional objects of benevolence. A portion of the church, embracing 142 members remained with Mr. Nott's society, and formed a"], [234, "202 HISTORY OF new church, which was organized Oct. 26, 1835, under the name of the \" First Congregational Church in Nashua Village.\" Feb.9, 1846, thename of this church was changed to \" Olive Street Con gregational Church.\" Shortly after the change in Mr. Nott's views, he withdrew from his con nection with the church and society, and Rev. Austin Richards, the present pastor, was install ed April 6th. 1S36. The number of church mem bers at the present time, (1846,) is 506. The Sabbath school contains 500 scholars, and has a library of 409 volumes. With the exception of the Ladies' Charity Circle and the Seaman's Friend Society, there are no regularly organized benevolent societies distinct from the church, but contributions are taken up during each year for the benefit of the Foreign and Home Missionary, the Tract, Bible, Education, Sabbath School, Sea man's Friend, and Foreign Evangelical Societies. In the Fall of 1824 and spring of 1S25, fifty new tenements or more had been erected, and ail was bustle and prosperity. In 1825 a new bridge was built over the Nashua river in Main street. in consequence of the raising of the water- by the dam at Indian Head. Lots of land were selling at the rate of \"about $1,000 per acre,\" according to the report of the Directors for that year. In 1826 a charter was granted to several indi viduals, by the name of the \" Proprietors of Tay lor's'Falls Bridge,\" for the purpose of building a bridge across the Merrimac. At this time the people crossed by a ferry, there being no bridge across the river between Lowell and Amoskeag. This bridge was completed and opened for public travel the same year. It is thirty-three rods in length, and its total cost was about $12,000. It was no small undertaking in the then feeble state of the village, and was deemed by many persons"], [235, "203 NASHUA. NASHVILLE. &C. a hazardous investment, but the prosperity of the place required it. and success has rewarded the effort. In the winter and spring of 1827, the Unita rian church was erected. The society enjoyed preaching in 1824 ; and from 1825 to 1826, hired and occupied the meeting house built by the Nashua Company. June 27, 1S27, the church was dedicated, and Rev. Nathaniel Gage ordain ed. In 1834 Mr. Gage asked a dismission ; and in 1835, Rev. Henry Emmons was ordained as pastor. In 1837 Mr. Emmons also asked a dismission, and May 16, 1838, Rev. Samuel Os good was ordained ; In December 1841, Mr. Os good requested a dismission, having received an invitation to settle at Providence, R. I. From this time the society was without a settled min ister until October 25, 1843, when Rev. A. C. L. Arnold was ordained. He was dismissed August 25, 1844. Rev. S. G. Bulfinch, the present pas tor, was installed September 17, 1845. The Sabbath School consists of 112 pupils. There is a S. S. Library containing about 400 volumes, and a Church Library of 180 volumes. A Be nevolent Circle is sustained by the ladies of the society. March 19, 1S35, the proprietors appropriated the grounds around the meeting house to the purpose of a burial place, under the name of the Nashua Cemetery. Of this an account will be given in the Appendix. In 1S27, Mill No. 2, of the Nashua Corporation was built and went into partial operation, and into full operation in 182S. Mill No. 3, was built in 1836. Mill No. 1, is 155 feet long, 45 feet wide, and 5 stories high. It contains 6,784 spin dles, and 220 looms, manufacturing No. 14 shirt ings and drills.

Mill No. 3. is 160 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 5 stories high. It contains 6,400 spindles, and 205 looms, and manufactures No. 14 sheetings. Mill No. 4, was built in 1844, and was put into operation in De cember of the same year. It is 198 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 5 stories high, and contains 6,720 spindles, and 200 looms, manufacturing No. .12 sheetings. The whole number of spindles in the four mills is 32,074, looms 940. Number of fe male operatives 835. Number of males 225. \u2014 These mills manufacture 11,500,000 yds. of cloth per annum : and use 8,000 bales of cotton, weigh ing 3,250,000 lbs., 150,000 lbs. starch, 8,000 gal lons sperm oil, $1250 worth leather, 700 cords of hard and pine wood, annually. There are 48 tenements for overseers and boarding houses, and two brick houses for the agent and clerk. Thom as W. Gillis, Esq., is the agent ; J. A. Baldwin, clerk. The capital is $800,000 ; the number of shares 1600, at $500 each. The Savings Bank deposites in 1845 were $44,000, by 364 depositers, three fourths of whom are females. No interest is allowed on any sum exceeding $500, and the privileges of the Bank are limited to individuals in the employ of the company. The rate of interest is 5 per cent. \u2014 On the first of June of every year interest is credited on all amounts and added to the princi pal, and interest computed on the total sum from that date, \u2014 thus giving to those who permit their savings to remain in the hands of the company for any length of time, the advantage of com pound interest.

The whole property was then disposed of to a new company, which was incorporated in 1830 by the name of the Jackson Company. They took out the old machinery, and converted the establishment into a cotton manufactory. The capital stock of this company is $180,000. They have two Mills, 150 and 155 feet in length, by 48 feet in width, and 4 stories high. These contain 11,588 spindles aud 378 looms, and em ploy 90 males and 350 females. The amount paid males per annum, is $30,000, \u2014 to females, $60,000.

In 1830, the population of Dunstable had in creased to 2,417 of which number about 1,500 resided within the village. In the winter of 1831, a new paper called the \"Nashua Herald\" was started by Dr. Simeon J. Bard, but it did not prosper, and was soon given up. In September, 1832, the \" New Hamp shire Telegraph,\" a weekly paper, was establish ed by Alfred Beard, and is now conducted by Albin Beard. \" The Oasis \" was established in January, 1843, by Murray & Sawtell, and is now published every Wednesday morning, by Murray & Kimball. In the fall of 1832, the First Baptist Society was organized, and obtained its present pastor, Rev. Dura D. Pratt. It was formed as early as 1818, and a church organized in 1822 ; but they were few and feeble, and preaching was main tained but a small portion of the time. A large and commodious meeting house was now erected, at a cost of nearly $8,000 ; and January 23, 1833, it was dedicated, and Rev. Mr. Pratt ordained. The church now comprises over 500 members. The Sabbath School consists of 350 members, and has a library of 300 volumes. The First Methodist Episcopal Society was organized November 3, 1832.

April 1, 1844, after the separation of Nashville, a new church was organized, under the name of the First Methodist Episcopal Church in Nashua, and during the same year the society purchased the meeting house formerly occupied by the Second Baptist Society, for $15,000, about half the original cost. Rev. E. A. Rice, of Lowell, Mass., supplied the pulpit for the first three months. From July 1. 1844, to July 1, 1845, the church was under the pastoral care of Rev. C. C. Burr. Rev. J. Boyce is the present pastor. This church contains 160 members. There are 268 scholars in the Sabbath School, and 360 vol umes in the library. From 1 S30 to 1837 the growth of the village was rapid and constant. The population of the village had nearly trebled in number. Trade and travel had increased proportionally. In the spring of 1835, the project was conceived of ex tending the Lowell Railroad to Nashua. June 23, 1835, a charter for this purpose was granted, by the Legislature of New Hampshire; and by that of Massachusetts, April 16, 1836. In 1836, the preparatory surveys were made and the loca tion filed. Uriah A. Boyden, Esq., was engaged as engineer. In May, 1837, the work upon the road was commenced, and October 8, 1838, the Nashua and Lowell Railroad was first opened for the transportation of passengers as far as the great elms near Judge Parker's house, where a temporary depot was erected. December 23, 1838, the bridge over the Nashua, and the depot *18"], [242, "208 HISTORY OF near Main street, were completed, and the cars for the first time came up to the present terminus. The length of the road is about fourteen and a half miles, exclusive of double tracks, and its total cost about $380,000, or about $25,000 per mile, including fixtures and apparatus. June 27, 1835, the Concord Railroad Company was incorporated. This Railroad was commenc ed in the spring of 1841, under the direction of William S. Whitwell, Esq., as engineer, and fin ished to Concord, September 1, 1842. Its length is 34 miles, 3048 feet. The net profits have been 10 per cent, per annum from its commencement. The amount of capital is $800,000. The officers of the Road are : Addison Gilmore, of Boston, President. Isaac Spalding, of Nashua, Treasurer. Charles H. Peaslee, of Concord, Clerk. June 19, 1835, the Nashua Bank was incorpo rated, with a capital of $100,000 ; and went into operation soon after. In 1835, the steamboat Herald was also built, and placed upon the Merrimac in the summer of 1836. It was intended to ply between Nashua and Lowell, but the shortness of the distance, \u2014 the inconvenience of the landing places, and the necessity for the shifting of passengers and bag gage, rendered the enterprise a failure. In 1835, the First Universalist Society was organized, under the pastoral charge of Rev. Woodbury M. Fernald. He preached until 1837, when Rev. A. P. Cleverly became their preacher. In 1839, a large meeting house was erected, and in October of that year, Rev. Lewis C. Browne was ordained as their pastor. In consequence of ill health, Mr. Browne requested a dismission in Sep tember, 1848, and Rev. Wm. H.

There are two be nevolent societies sustained by the ladies of the society. The Sabbath School embraces 20 teach ers, and 175 scholars. The Sabbath School Li brary numbers 600 volumes. In April, 1836, the population had increased to 5065, of which number 2105 were males, and 2960 females. During this year, a Second Baptist Society was formed under Rev. N. W. Smith, and a meeting house erected. In 1838, Rev. Samuel C. Pratt was ordained as its pastor. In 1839, the society was again united to the First Baptist Society. January 1, 1837, the township laid aside its ancient name of Dunstable, which it had worn from its infancy, through good and evil fortune a hundred and sixty years, under which it had witnessed two revolutions and formed a portion of a Colony, a Province, and a sovereign State, \u2014 under which it had passed through many wars, and grown up from obscurity and poverty ; and adopted in order to distinguish it from its neigh bor \" t'other Dunstable,\" its present name, that of the river from which its prosperity is chiefly derived \u2014 Nashua.

In November, 1845, the services of the Protes tant Episcopal Church were, for the first time, regularly observed in Nashua. The court-room of the town house has been occupied for this purpose. Rev. Milton Ward is the officiating minister. In 1845, a large machine shop, built of brick and slated, was erected by the Nashua Company on the site of the old one. The main building is 150 feet long, with an addition of 158 feet, used for a blacksmith's shop, furnace, &c. The main building is occupied by shuttle and bobbin makers, locksmiths, gunsmiths, manufacturers of axes, hoes, ploughs, and by artisans in other branches. The whole number of workmen employed in the building is two hundred and eighteen. A portion of this building is occupied by ihe extensive es- tablishment of Messrs. J. & E. Baldwin, for the manufacture of shuttles and bobbins, which gives employment to a number of workmen. The manufacturing business of the Nashua Lock Company is also done here. This estab- lishment, of which L. W. Noyesand David Bald- win are the proprietors, is employed in the manu- facture of mortise locks and latches for dwelling house doors, and rose wood and brass knobs for the handles of the same. They usually have in their employment about 40 men, and manufac- tured, during the last year, $35,000 worth of goods. These manufactures embraced 56,617 locks and latches, and 35,000 pairs of rose wood knobs."], [245, "II 211 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, kC. Another portion of this shop is occupied by Mr. John H. Gage for building turning engines, machines for planing iron, engines for cutting gears, scroll chucks, and all other tools requisite to fill a large machine shop for building cotton and other machinery, and for doing railroad work. Mr. Gage now employs sixty-four work men, and does business to the amount of about $40,000 per annum. The \" Nashua Manufacturing and Mechanics Association \" was chartered January 2, 1829, with liberty to have a capital to the extent of $30,000. This company was organized under the charter August, 1845. The present capital is $10,000, with 200 shares at $50 each. The contemplation is to erect a brick building 100 feet long, two stories high, with two wings, each 150 feet long and 40 feet wide, one story, with an attic. The work in this shop is to be conducted by means of a steam engine of fifty horse power, and is intended to embrace all kinds of mechanical work similar to the Nashua Company's shop. \u2014 One wing of the building is now completed, and is occupied by Mr. Edwin Chase, for the manu facture of doors, window blinds and sashes.

Their ar rangements are such that they can melt nine or ten tons of iron at a melting, or eighteen tons in twelve hours. They now employ thirty men, and have room for twenty more. The amount of their business is not far from $40,000 a year. In 1845, Mr. Alanson Crane commenced a cotton manufacturing establishment on Salmon Brook at the Harbor. His mill is 30 by 40 feet on the ground, two stories high, with an attic. When in full operation this mill will contain 500 spindles, for making cotton yarn of various num bers and qualities. The yarn, when manufac tured, is worked up into braids and cords of va rious descriptions ; also twine for weavers' har nesses, knitting cotton, &c. The number of op eratives employed is 20, 4 males and 16 females. About $30,000 worth of goods are manufactured annually. A dye house is connected with this establishment for dyeing braids, cords, yarn, &c. From a survey recently made it is estimated that there is sufficient water running in Salmon Brook to operate 1500 spindles, and Mr. Crane contem plates erecting another mill with about 1000 spin dles and looms for the manufacture of cotton shirtings, sheetings, and drillings. At the annual meeting of the town of Nashua, March, 1842, it was voted to erect a Town House. Of this structure, now completed, an account will be given in the Appendix. In 1842, the town of Nashua was divided, and a part of the territory, chiefly lying north of the Nashua river, received the name of Nashville. \u2014 The following act of incorporation, passed by the Legislature, June 23, 1842, defines the limits of the new town : \" Be it enacted by the Senate and House of"], [247, "213 NASHUA.

By the wondrous alchemy of skill and enterprise, out of the waters of the Nashua and the sands of this pine barren, from some half do zen dwellings, have been raised up within these twenty-six years these thronged, and beautiful villages of near seven thousand people. We have now traced this History through a period of nearly two centuries. From its wilder ness state, by toil and privations, by bloodshed and sufferings, by enterprise and capital combin ed, has this place been brought to its present con dition. Its prosperity must now depend upon its trade and manufactures, and for the increase of them every effort should be made. Its central position and its facilities of transportation are ad vantages, which caunot be too highly appreciated. The multiplication of shops and stores, and the amount of their trade, are evidences of what has been accomplished by enterprise, and offer strong encouragements for the future. Other manufac tures besides cotton are creeping in, thus far with great success, and should be encouraged. The manufactures of shuttles and bobbins, locks, guns, ploughs, edge tools, machinery, iron, brass, and tin ware, carriages, saddlery, sashes, blinds, doors, hats, caps, boots and shoes, reeds, cigars, furni ture, time-pieces, boxes, stoves, and of patent leather, and book-binding, employ a large amount of capital and furnish employment to a large number of persons.

NOTICES OF TOWNS INCLUDED IN OLD DUN- STABLE. HISTORICAL SKETCH OF HUDSON. We have seen that this town was included in the original grant of Dunstable, and was set off into a separate township by the General Assem bly of Massachusetts in 1732, by the name of Nottingham. After the establishment of the boun dary line, by which it fell within the limits and jurisdiction of New Hampshire, it received a new act of incorporation, July 5, 1746, and its name was changed to Nottingham West, there being already a Nottingham in the eastern section of the state. A small addition was made to its ter ritory, by annexing a part of Londonderry, March 6, .1778, and the township now contains 17,379 acres. July 1, 1830, its name was changed by the Legislature to Hudson. Hudson was not settled until after 1710, al though several tracts of land within its bounds were granted before 1660. The names of some of the early settlers were Blodgett, Colburn, Cross, (taken captive at Dunstable, in 1724,) Cummings, Greeley, Hill, Lovewell, Marsh, Merrill, Pollard, and Winn. The first settle ments were made on the banks of the Merrimac where the Indians had cleared fields for cultiva ting corn. The first settlers lived in garrisons,"], [251, "217 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, *C but there is no record that any depredations were ever committed by the Indians in this town. \u2014 Near the Indian cornfields have been found cin ders, like those of a blacksmith's forge, which have led to the conjecture that they employed a smith to manufacture their implements of war and agriculture. November 30, 1737, a Congregational church was formed, and on the same day Rev. Nathan iel Merrill was ordained its pastor. His relation as pastor to the church continued until his death in 1796, although his civil contract with the town was dissolved in 1774. Rev. Jabez Pond Fisher succeeded Mr. Merrill, and was ordained Feb. 24, 1796, but was dismissed in. 1801. July 3, 1774, Rev. John Strickland was ordained, but af ter a few years was dismissed by the town. In 1S05 a Baptist church was organized, over which Rev. Daniel Merrill officiated from 1814 to 1819. In 1S16 the Congregational church changed their form of government and united with the Presby terians. In 1842 a new house of worship was erected by this society ; Rev. William Page is the present pastor. In 1840, a society was formed and a meeting house erected by the Methodists; Rev. Matthew Newhall is the officiating minister. In 1S41 a meeting House was erected by the Baptist society, and Rev. Joseph Storer was set tled as pastor. Hudson contains no lawyer and but one phy sician, Dr. Henry M. Hooke. There are ten dis trict schools, for the support of which in 1845 $700 were expended. Of this sum $430 were raised by the town, $156 given by the inhabi tants in boarding teachers, $84 were derived from interest of the surplus revenue, and $30 from the Literary Fund. In April 1776, before the Declaration of Inde-"], [252, "218 HISTORY OF pendence, the following Test Oath was sent out to each town in the state : \" We the subscribers do hereby solemnly engage and promise that we will to the utmost of our power, at the risque of our lives and fortunes, with arms oppose the Hos- tile Proceedings of the British Fleets and Armies against the United American Colonies.\" Every person was required lo sign this Test, or be look- ed upon as an enemy to his country. These Test Oaths were returned to the Convention then in session, and a large portion of them still exist. \u2014 In Hudson 119 signed the pledge, and one only, Capt. Joseph Kelley, refused to sign.

The greater part of the township of Litchfield was granted, as we have seen, as early as 1656, to William Brenton, and called \" Brenton 's Farm.\" Its Indian name was Naticook, and the intervale portions of the town, as well as of Mer rimac, Hudson, and Nashua, were inhabited and cultivated by a branch of the Penacooks, called sometimes, the Naticooks. It was settled about 1720, but when and by whom is unknown. Of the early settlers some were from Billerica, and some from Chelmsford, and among them were the names of Underwood, Chase, Bixby, Tufts, and Parker. It was set off from Dunstable, and incorporated by Massachusetts as a township, extending on both sides of Merrimac river, July 5, 1734. The charter was afterwards confirmed by New Hampshire, June 5, 1749, the Merrimac being established as its western boundary. It contains 8,426 acres. In the petition for incorporation, signed by Aquila Underwood in behalf of the town, dated May, 1734, it is said \" that they have supported a minister for some time.\" This was probably Rev. Joshua Tafts, who was settled in 1736, and dismissed in 1744. January 2, 1765, Rev. Sam uel Cotton, of Newton, was ordained, \u2014 -dismiss ed in 1784, and died at Claremont in 1819. A Presbyterian church was formed 1819, and Rev. Nathaniel Keuedy ordained April 12, 1S09. He was dismissed April, 1812. Rev. Enoch Pills-"], [255, "221 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, &C. bury was ordained October 25, 1815, and died February 15, 1818, aged 34. In 1825, Rev. John Shirer was minister. Rev. Mr. Porter was or dained as pastor in 1845. In the French war of 1756, Litchfield had two soldiers at least in the army, Timothy Bar ron and William Barron. During the Revolu tionary war also, Litchfield furnished its propor tion of soldiers for the army. It contained 57 males between sixteen and fifty years of age, and its annual proportion of soldiers furnished was seven. December 4, 1784, died Hon. Wiseman Clag gett. He was born at Bristol, England, in 1*21, and his father was a wealthy barrister at law. \u2014 He was educated at the Inns of Court and ad mitted a barrister of the King's Bench. In 1748, he went to Antigua, in the West Indies, to seek his fortune, where he remained about ten years. In 1758, he emigrated to New England, and es tablished himself at Portsmouth, N. H. In 1775, he was appointed Attorney General of the Prov ince by the royal commission, which he held until 1769, having been superseded by Samuel Livermore, on account of his attachment to the cause of the people. In 1772, he purchased a farm at Litchfield, and removed there with his family. On the adoption of the Constitution of January 5, 1776, Mr. Claggett was appointed solicitor gen eral of the State, an office which he held until his death. He was chosen a member of the Council for 1776, and appointed soon after a member of the Committee of Safety. He often represented Litchfield in the General Court, and was once chosen for Merrimac and Bedford, the law not requiring the representative to be an in habitant of the town for which he is elected. \u2014"], [256, "222 HISTORY OF He was a classical scholar, a good lawyer, a wit and a poet.

All that part of Merrimac which lies south of the Souhegan river, was included in the Dunsta ble grant. Its Indian name was Naticook. In"], [258, "224 HISTORY OF July, 1729, the lands lying north of the Souhe gan, three miles in width, were granted to Capt. Joseph Blanchard and others. In 1733, all these grants lying north of Penichuck Brook, and in cluding a part of Narragansett No. 5, or Amherst, (granted to the soldiers of Philip's war) were in corporated into a township, at first called Souhe gan East; then Rnmford, and afterwards Merri mac. April 2, 1746, it was chartered anew by the Legislature of New Hampshire, and contains 19,361 acres. Merrimac was settled about 1722, and among its earliest inhabitants were the names of Usher, Hassell, and Chamberlain. A daughter of Has sell is said have been the first person born in the town. About 1670, John Cromwell built a tra ding house at Cromwell's Falls, but was soon driven away by the Indians. His house was standing in 1679. The account of Cromwell with the Indian history of the town, is incorpo rated with that of Dunstable. September 5, 1772, a Congregational Church was formed, and October 14, 1772, Rev. Jacob Burnap, D. D., from Reading, Mass., who grad uated at Harvard College in 1770, was ordained. He died December 27, 1821, having admitted to the church 194 members. He was eminently distinguished for his superior knowledge of the original languages, in which the scriptures were written, and was much esteemed for his piety, integrity, patience, and all the social virtues. \u2014 His son, Rev. George W. Burnap, is now a dis tinguished clergyman in Baltimore, Md. Since the death of Dr. Burnap, there have been various ministers. At present Rev. Mr. Allen is their pastor. At the mouth of the Souhegan is a valuable water privilege, upon which a factory was erected"], [259, "225 NASHUA, NASHVILLE, &C many years ago, by Isaac Riddle and Sons. It was consumed by fire June 10, 1818, with a loss of $6,000. Another factory, called \" the Souhe gan Cotton, Woollen, and Nail Factory,\" was afterwards erected, and shared the same\" fate. \u2014 There are other privileges upon the river, and it is a matter of regret that they should remain so long unimproved. \" This town claims the first discovery in this region of the art of making what are called ' Leghorn Bonnets,' and other grass work. They were first made by the Misses Burnap, before 1820, who are deserving of much credit for their skill and enterprise in this species of manufacture. Some of their bonnets have been sold in Boston as high as $50.00. Hon. Matthew Thornton, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, resided in this town for many years previous to his death. He was a native of Ireland, but emigrated to this country at an early age. He first settled in the eastern part of the State, from which he removed to Londonderry, and afterwards to Merrimac in 1780. Before the Revolution he was eminent as a physician. He Was also a Colonel in the mili tia, and in 1775 was. President of the Convention which met at Exeter, and assumed the Govern ment of the Colony in the name of the People. He was chosen a delegate to the Congress which met at Philadelphia in 1776, and as such affixed his name to the Declaration of Independence. He held the office of Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas for the County, and afterwards was a Judge of the Supreme Court of the State until 1782.

He was Colonel of the regi ment in 1775, but on the Declaration of Inde pendence he joined the English, left the country, to which he never returned, and at the close of the war his estate was confiscated by the State. Hon. James B. Thornton, a grandson of Hon. Matthew Thornton, died at Callao, Peru, Janua ry 25, 1833. At the time of his death he was Charge des Affaires of the United States, within that Province.

The following description of the Nashua Town House, and Cemetery, is taken from the Directory of 1843. The Town House was completed in the spring of 1843: \u2014 At the annual meeting of the Town of Nashua, March, 1842, it was voted to erect a Town House. The com mittee appointed to receive proposals for a site on which it should be erected, purchased of Aaron F. Sawyer, Esq., the land on which stood his house and office, a lot about 95 by 133 feet. The building committee were Leonard W. Noyes, Israel Hunt, Jr., Thomas Chase, Franklin Fletcher, and Samuel Shepherd, Esqs. Samuel Shep herd, Esq., was chosen Architect; and under his superin tendence, the edifice, for taste in its design and utility in its construction, is not surpassed by any other structure of the kind in New England. It is constructed of brick on a very durable foundation ef stone, with a basement of fine hammered granite. The ornaments, lamp stands, and balconies, mostly from Grecian patterns, are of cast iron. The portico, 7 feet by 18, is of iron on a base of granite. The building is 66 by 90 feet, and consists of the base ment, first and second stories, and the attic."], [292, "1 258 APPENDIX. One half of the basement is used for a cellar; the other half ife occupied as a market, it being 9 feet high, 4 feet of which are above ground. It is well lighted, and there is good access from the north, south and west sides. The first story contains two large rooms, the entrances to which are on Main street, each 18 by 24 feet and 13 1-2 feet high, one on each side of the front entrance; occu- pied as stores. In the rear of these rooms are two smaller ones, each 18 by 14 feet, occupying nearly one half of the first story ; and in the rear of the above rooms, is the lower hall, a fine room 17 feet high and 38 by 63 feet It is lighted by seven windows, and contains a gallery- \u2014 thus giving room for an audience of about five hundred persons. The entries in this story are very spacions. The front entry is 38 feet in length and 8 in width. Entering this from the portico on Main street, we observe first two spa- cious stairways for the ascent to the third story. On our right and left, beyond the stairs, are entrances to the rooms fronting on Main street. Following the entry to its end, we find the door, opening into the lower hall. Crossing at right angles the eastern end of the entry we have i described, is another entry, leading from the north to the south side of the building, 66 feet long and 10 wide. \u2014 These of couse give three doors for entrance or exit. On this second entry are the two smaller rooms. Ascending the stairs into the seeond story, we find the Town Hall, 70 feet long, 63 feet wide, 24 feet high, with moveable seats, arranged so as to form a centre aisle and two side aisles. With the gallery, there is sufficient room for 1300 persons to be comfortably seated. It is lighted by eleven large windows. There are also, in this story, two small rooms, one on each side of the stairway, each 14 by 12 feet, and occupied as offices. The attic, 70 by 20 feet, is finished for the use of military companies."], [293, "259 APPENDIX. The height of the building, from the ground to the top of the cupola, is about 100 feet. The cost was nearly $23,000. NASHUA CEMETERY. March 19, 1835, the proprietors of the real estate of the First Unitarian Congregational Society in Dunstable passed a vote appropriating their grounds contiguous to the meeting-house for a burial place, under the designation of the Nashua Cemetery. In addition to which, a piece of land, owned by Daniel Abbot, Esq., lying north of the premises above described, containing about 8,000 feet, was purchased and appropriated to the same use. Aster hav- ing disposed of 29 lots by subscription, at $25 per lot, the proprietors enclosed the ground with a substantial fence, \u2014 made the several paths and avenues, and divided the whole into 85 lots of 20 by 17 feet each. Five lots were reserved es ministerial lots for the then religious societies in Dun- stable. Four only were accepted. The first was accepted by the First Congregational Society in Dunstable, the second by the First Congregational Society in Nashua, the third by the First Methodist Episcopal Society, the fourth by the Unitarian Society. In August, 1835, an addition to the Cemetery was made by the purchase of a piece of land of Mr. Christopher Paige, lying east of the same, containing about 35,000 feet, by an association of individuals for that purpose, to be known by the name of The Nashua Cemetery Ad ditional, and which was divided into 104 lots, two of which were appropriated by the proprietors for the use and benefit of strangers. Of the 85 lots in the original Cemetery, 22 remain unsold, leaving 26 lots unsold out of 189 in both Cemeteries."], [294, "260 APPENDIX. The price of lots is $26, with interest from June 15, 1835.

The Post Office in this town was established some time between April 1st., and July 1st., 1803, and Gen. Noah Lovewell appointed Postmaster. The office was opened in the tavern of Mr. Cummings Pollard, who was appointed Assistant Postmaster, and had the charge of the office until 1811. Up to that time it was located in the tavern lately owned and occupied by Mr. Silas Gibson. In 1811, the office was removed to the \"Harbour\" so called, and placed under the charge of Israel Hunt, who was appointed Assistant Postmaster, and in whose dwell ing house it was stationed. After its removal to the latter place, it being located near the residence of Gen. Love well, he continued to superintend the duties of the office personally until his death, which took place in May, 1820. Upon his death, John M. Hunt, Esq., was appointed and commissioned in June, 1820. He established the office in the office of I. and J. M. Hunt, (at the Harbour,) where it remained until 1826, when it was removed to Nashua Village, soon after the erection of the cotton mills. Since its establishment in 1803, the receipts of the office have increased to an astonishing, and almost incredible degree. The receipt for the first quarterly balance of postage, (l.)
