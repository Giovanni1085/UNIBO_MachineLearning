To seize the grand outline with the mind's eye, to adapt the design to the predominant features in the landscape, to unfold the beauties of nature by the masterly touches of art, is the sublime province of the ornamental composer of rural scenery. That this science has been cultivated with the greatest success in this country, even jealousy and national rivalry will not pretend to deny. Foreign writers, distinguished for their taste, have allowed t"], [16, "r\u00bb PRELIMINARY ESSAY tlie English, a pre-eminence in landscape and ornamental gardening, and that they were the first who emancipated themselves from the trammels of prejudice and for mality : and recurring to nature, which had long been banished from the seats of the great, invited her to her deserted abodes, and gave her a new and more im posing aspect. Kent saw the incongruity of artificial design, when at variance with nature. The straight walk, the clipped hedge, the tor tured yew, sunk beneath the superior chastity of his taste. He made as much progress as an innovator, who had a pre vailing bad taste to contend with, could be expected to do. Perhaps his own was not quite correct. One age seldom unfold* an idea, and brings that idea to perfection. We have had schools of painting, as well as of ornamental scenery. Some masters were distinguished for one excellence, and some for another. The force of genius has at intervals prevailed over original disad vantages ; and produced works to be ad mired, though not in every respect de serving, imitation. Reynolds, who will"], [17, "ON LANDSCAPE GARDENING. 3 ever remain the glory of British painters, with a mind enlightened by science, and chastised by taste, embodied the form, and caught the character, which he transfused into the colouring on the canvas. He grouped \u2014 he combined \u2014 he followed na ture, and therefore succeeded ; but he had great artists among his predecessors, who paved the way for the attainment of supe rior excellence. It was not thus with picturesque embel lishment. The science was comparatively new; and where attempts had been for merly made, they were in general conduct ed on a wrong principle, or proceeded from a vitiated taste. Kent had every obstacle in his way ; yet he accomplished much ; and gratitude is due to him who deviates from a wrong path, and aspires to perfection, though he may not be able to reach her temple. To Kent succeeded Brown \u2014 a man ori ginally bred a gardener; and from this fortuitous circumstance, without a par ticle of his genius, every person who can superintend a kitchen-garden, or handle a 6pade, has thought himself qualified to B 2"], [18, "4 VREL1MINARY ESSAY quit his sphere, and attempt design. But Brown possessed an originality of concep tion, a Poet's eye, and an instinctive taste for rural embellishment. He was at last animated and inspired by some of his own creations. He saw the deformity of perverted beauty with keener optics than Kent \u2014 he viewed nature with the enthusiasm of a lover ; and though it cannot be denied, that he some times tricked her out in meretricious orna ments, and patched her with too refined an art, he never lost sight of her prominent charms ; and his worst errors can only be considered as minute pimples on a beautiful face*. We have, however, seen this mighty master of picturesque embellishment seT verely censured by some of his own coun t^men, who, indulging too much in the visions of theory, have denied him the merit of practical excellence. Because Brown could execute better than he could \u2022 Brown, as an ingenious critic observes, made it his maxim to follow and to copy Nature; whom, if he did not always represent in the images he set up to her honour, he at least caused to be admired and adored."], [19, "ON LANDSCAPE GARDENING. 5 describe, and worked by self-taught rules, he has been attacked with unbecoming asperity ; and some of his most capital performances have been ascribed to chance, or to a dereliction of his own principles. But who can reduce the infinite variety of situations that ask for improvement, to any systematic principles ! The powerful genius of a place will imperiously set rules at defiance ; and, in fact, art can only be the handmaid of nature, whose beauties, presenting a boundless variety, are alike indignant of confinement and control*. The attempt at system is only an effort to bring us back to what has justly been exploded. \" I have no magical skill in planting roses,\" says Gray ; and were this skill attainable, the landscape gardener should reject it.

Who, that now visits these picturesque scenes can deny, but that plantations have been applied to all the principal purposes which M. De Girardin, perhaps copying from his beloved Erme nonville, conceives ought to be their grand objects : \"To form the perspective or side scenes of the foreground, that may best connect the distances, with the principal points of view.\" \"To raise such elevations or scenes, as may give relief even to an absolute flat.\" \"To hide all disagreeable objects.\" \" To give more extent to those that are pleasing, by concealing their terminations behind a mass of wood ; by which means the imagination continues them beyond the point where they are seen.\" \" To give an agreeable outline to all surfaces, whether of land or water.\" These are the ideas of a master ; and we here see them realized.

His unvarying circular belts too, where they are not broken into masses, as we see them here, and when they serve to exclude the prospect of the surrounding country, are real defects in picturesque beauty. No kind of property is less the object of envyr, or more grateful to the eye, than to take possession of a country in an extensive view : it contributes to the general beauty, and is equally enjoyed by all, without offence to any.

This vic tory being atchieved on the second day of August, 1704, it was enacted, \"That on the same day of every year for ever, the inheritors of his Grace's honours and titles should render at Windsor to her Majesty, her heirs and successors, one standard or colours, with three fleurs-de-lis painted thereon, as an acquittance for all manner of rents, suits, and services due to the Crown.\" The terms of this tenure are punctually observed. \u2022 Though Parliament was apparently so liberal, immense sums have been expended by the family on this noble structure and its aecom. pariiments. to bring it to its present state.

The Palace appears in front, the towers of which rise into the horizon; on the left, part of the borough of Woodstock; on the right, a broad and deep valley, through which flows a river of equal extent, with bold and wind ing shores, at a proportionate distance in tersected, but visibly not terminated, by a Bridge of corresponding magnificence to the grandeur of the scene; \u2014 a swelling lawn, crowned with a superb and lofty Column, which leaves the tallest trees, that seem crowding round its base, at ail immense distance below; while light clumps, shady groves, and plantations of different shapes and hues, skirt the bounding dales, or clothe the remoter slopes; \u2014 a second reach of water beyond the bridge, fringed by deep woods that rise to the very summit of the opposite hill, and compose a vari ously tinted and indented surface of luxu riant foliage \u2014 all these form an assemblage of attractions, unrivalled ; and conspire to strike the eye of taste with an irresistible charm.

At a small distance from this portal, towards the right, is the Centrum Phoni cum, or speaker's place, of a very remark able polysyllabical articulate Echo ; which, according- to Dr. Plott, in his Natural History of Oxfordshire, will distinctly re peat seventeen syllables in a calm day, and in the night twenty: but the demolition. of the ancient palace, which stood on the brow of the opposite hill, the extension of the river, or these effects combined, have in a great measure diminished its sur prising powers. However, a very superior Echo may still be heard by a speaker stationed near an old cedar tree, between Rosamond's Well and the bridge; and it is nothing unusual for those who are ac quainted with this circumstance to com pliment the vocal nymph with a familiar salutation, which is speedily returned with amazing exactness of articulation, and re- D"], [34, "18 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM\". iterated according to the stillness of th*? surroundings scene. Musical sounds have a delightful effect on this spot; and I have heard the vocal nymph complimented with a song in her own praise, in which she did not disdain to join. A broad gravel-road, preserving one uniform direction for a quarter of a mile, and gradually diverging from the sweep of the river, conducts us towards the eastern gate of the palace. This road is almost wholly open. On the Woodstock side, only a few small rising clumps appear, which assist to conceal the boundary from other points of view, and to break the line of some private houses; a few trees, fanci fully disposed, skirt the slope, and others of a larger growth range with the stream on its very edge, and afford some pretty glades into the water between their trunks and boughs; but their heads scarcely rising above the level of the walk, they serve rather to vary than to conceal.

Below, in niches near the angles, are the Medicean Venus, and the Dancing fawn, in bronze, from the originals in the Grand Duke of Tuscany's collection, and executed with inimitable skill, by Maximilian Sol dani Benzi, at Florence, in 1711. The arcades on the right and left are adorned with marble termini. Below, on a black marble slab, stands a fine antique Diana and Dog; and exactly opposite, on a similar slab, is a beautiful Vase with figures in relievo, from the antique, sup posed to represent the nuptial ceremonie* of the Romans. Over the grand stair-case is a large picture, by Hudson, of Charles Duke of Marlborough and Family; and beyond the"], [49, "paintings, &c. 27 arcades, on the other side of the hall, the first Duke and Family are delineated by th\u00ab pencil of Closterman. II. BOW-WINDOW ROOM. From the hall, we proceed along a gal lery to the bow-window room. The famous battle of Blenheim is pourtrayed in the tapestry on the right at entrance, and oc cupies a considerable space. The principal action is confined to the taking of Marshal Tallard. The battle of Wynendael is re presented in the tapestry on the left. Over the first door is St. Jerome study ing, very fine, by Giorgioni.

V. GRAND CABINET. This magnificent apartment opens to the east and south, and commands the most"], [55, "PAINTINGS, &C. 33 charming scenery. The hangings and fur- niture are rich crimson damask, with gilding of corresponding splendor : the cornice^ in particular, is extremely elegant; and in the centre of the ceiling is a large circular gilt plume. The chimney-piece is com posed of dark-coloured marble, inlaid with white, in ornamental festoons, with an urn, projecting in relievo, which has a delightful effect; over it stand the listening Slave, and a crouching Venus in bronze, and between them two very curious jars. The paintings are some of the most su perb in any collection, particularly those of Reubens, of whose works there is an un rivalled assemblage in Blenheim. I. 1.

The head in the centre of the chimney is a delicate piece of sculpture ; the whole is exquisitely finished in white marble. The large gilt branches on each side, above, are peculiai'ly elegant. The paintings are : I. 1. Isaac blessing Jacob, by Rem brandt; \u2014 an oval in claro obscuro, very ex pressive, from an ancient gem, by Rebecca. II. 1.

The tapestry hangings of this apartment represent the four Cardinal Virtues, with their characteristic emblems and ac companiments ; and in vivid beauty of co louring they approach nearer to painting than any thing of the same kind in Blen heim. I. Fortitude, with proper insignia. The man wrenching open the lion's jaws is ex tremely expressive. II.

On the other side of the chimney, Jus tice, with her balance and sword, and. Other distinguishing characteristics,,"], [59, "PAINTINGS, &c. 37 III. Temperance, with her curb. The River God pouring water out of his urn, is finely imagined, and attracts the notice of every spectator. The only paintings are, a most animated one of Lord Stafford and his Secretary, (of which there are two others in this kingdom, all reputed originals) over the first door; \u2014 a very beautiful portrait of Mary Duchess of Richmond, with a little girl presenting her gloves, over the chimney; and portraits in one piece of Mrs. Morton and Mrs. Kil ligrew, two of Charles II. 's favourites, over the other door : all by Vandyke. In the centre of the very elegant chim ney-piece, formed of the richest marbles, is an alto relievo of Cupid and Psyche's Marriage, from the antique. A notification is engraved in Greek characters, signifying that Tryphon executed the original. Over this are two Centaurs in bronze, and two beautiful urns of Derbyshiie spar. In this room also are small bronzes of Cupids, and of Hercules killing the Cen taurs. The mirrors are singularly superb. VIII. DINING ROOM. This apartment is well adapted for its"], [60, "38 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. destination, being large, lofty, and com modiously situated, near the centre of the palace. The ceiling is richly stuccoed, and the sides are wainscotted in large pan nels, painted white.

On the pannels near the windows, at each end, are three small Landscapes, by Wootton. IX. SALOON. This noble and spacious apartment, which communicates with the Hall, and together with it occupies the entire breadth of the Centre, is highly finished, and richly de corated. \u2014 It is lined in the lower part with marble, in the Italian taste, and its four door-cases are entirely composed of the same beautiful and durable material. Over each door, which face the four quarters, are the arms of the first duke. Above the marble basement are six compartments, in which different nations of the world are depicted in their characteristic dresses and contours, by La Guerre. These, however, are rather individual caricatures than na tural delineations : they are shewn in the following manner, and said to represent,"], [62, "DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. 40 I. The Painter,\u2014 French,\u2014 English*, and Scotch. II. Spaniards. III. Moors and Negroes. IV. Chinese and Tartars. V. Turks. VI. Dutch and Swedes. The ceiling is the height of the building* and is executed by the same artist with pe culiar felicity, both in design and per formance. It emblematically represents John Duke of Marlborough in the career of victory, arrested by the hand of Peace, while Time reminds him of the rapidity of his own flight. Over the first chimney stands an antique bust of a Roman Consul ; \u2014 and at the same end of the room, a marble slab, on which lies a finely sculptured Sleeping Venus. Over the second chimney is an antique bust of Caracalla ; \u2014 and on another marble slab, Cleopatra and the Asp. X. GREEN DRAWING ROOM.

I. Battle of Dunnewert. II. The Battle of Lisle, on the right of the chimney ; \u2014 Siege of Lisle, on the left. The French Spy is very expressively de lineated. III. Battle of Malplaquet. The eager attention of the person receiving orders is admirably drawn. Over the first door is a charming por trait of a young Knight of St. John of Jerusalem, by Ban-occio ; \u2014 over the oppo site door, a very masterly painting of Me leager and Atalanta, by Reubens.

A Serpent bending down its head from the top of a small urn, round which the hours are arranged, points out the time with its sting; and on the same urn, an elegant figure of Contemplation leaning, gives the whole a singular and rather monumental air. On each side are Boj's' Gambols, in bronze. Above, is a highly finished and very at tractive picture of her Grace the Duchess of Marlborough, in an elegant white dress, by Romney. On the marble slabs under the windows, are bronzes of Fame and Mercury, mounted on Pegasi. The curtains, sofas, and other furniture, are deep green damask, of great richness and beauty. XI. STATE DRAWING ROOM. This apartment has been recently deco rated, and furnished with the utmost mag nificence. The ceiling is elegant; \u2014 the cornice richly gilt; \u2014 and the bordure round the room is in a corresponding stile. The mirrors are almost unrivalled in the super-"], [65, "paintings, &C 43 lative elegance of their frames ; the mag nitude of their plates is likewise very con siderable. The chimney is composed of the purest white marble: it is adorned with a small central urn, supported by two griffins ; these, likewise, are part of the embellish ments of the mirrors : they belong to the family arms. The marble slabs are pro portionate to the splendor of the rest. A highly finished cabinet at the lower end supports a rich lustre. The curtains and furniture are white damask. One of the principal ornaments, however, of the room, is a superb picture of his Grace the Duke of Marlborough, in his garter robes, by Romney : it is placed over the chimney. From this beautiful painting, Jones has executed a very happy mezzotinto : another of the Duchess from Romney's Painting, in the last described apartment, has likewise been finished by the same artist. The tapestry is a continuation of the first Duke's atchievements. I. and II. The March to Bouchain. II. and III. the Siege of Bouchain. In this piece, Lord Cadogan's Dog, which G 2"], [66, "44 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. attended his master through the campaigns, and returned safe, makes a conspicuous figure. Over the first door is a Fruit Piece, by Lucca Giordano. Over the opposite door, St. Laurence distributing the ornaments of the altar, by II Prete Genoese. XII. STATE BED-CHAMBER. In a palace there must be apartments for pomp as well as for utility ; this is one of the former, and very splendid of the kind. The furniture and hangings are rich blue damask, interlaced with gold. The bed-posts are elegantly fluted, and covered with burnished gold : their extremities adorned with military emblems. The top rises into a dome, surmounted with a ducal coronet; at the head are the family arms. The chimney-piece is decorated with bronzes of Hercules killing the Centaurs and the Hydra; \u2014 between these is a bust of Diana \u2014 over it is a capital picture, by Lucca Giordano, representing Seneca bleed ing to death, while with philosophic com posure he dictates to his amanuensis."], [67, "PAINTINGS, &C 45 On a pannel to the right is a fine portrait of Edward VI. by Holbein. A view of Architecture, by Panini. The burning of Troy, by Old Frank. Over each door is a piece of still life, by Maltese. From this stately suite of rooms, where the profusion of splendid objects is apt to dazzle the organs of sight, the eye is both charmed and relieved on entering, XIII. THE LIBRARY. This very spacious apartment, which oc cupies the entire West Front, is upwards of one hundred and eighty-three feet long, and is thirty-one feet nine inches wide in the centre. It is impossible to conceive any thing more superb than the solid columns of veined marble which support a rich enta blature, the Doric pilasters of the same, the surrounding basement of black marble, and the stuccoed compartments of the lofty vaulted cieling, which open a fine field for the pencil of the first master in the pictorial art. This noble room was originally intended as a gallery for paintings; but has since"], [68, "46 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. been furnished with the grand Sunderland collection of books, comprising upwards of seventeen thousand volumes, in various languages, arts, and sciences; all arranged in elegant cases, with gilt wire latticed doors, on the east sid. through its whole extent, and along the two ends. Few private collections are equal to this in value, the whole being reckoned worth 30,000 pounds ; yet this is not the only library in the palace, nor does it contain more than its proportion of rare and curious books. The Spencer family indeed, in all its branches, is distinguished for its literary taste, and the magnificence and extent of its literary treasures. At the upper end of the library stands a highly finished white marble statue of Queen Anne, in her coronation robes, by Ryshrack ; on the pedestal is this in scription : TO THE MEMORY OF QUEEN ANNE ! UNDER WHOSE AUSPICES JOHN DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH CONQUEUID, AND TO WHOSE MUNIFICENCE HE AND HIS POSTERITY WITH GRATITUDE OWS THE POSSESSION OF BIENHEIMT A. D. MDCCXXVI."], [69, "PAINTINGg, &C. 47 In a recess on the west side, is an antique statue, inscribed Julia Domna ; \u2014 and lower down, another of Diana and Dog, both on mahoganv therms. At the lower end is a bust of Alexander the Great; a fine specimen of Grecian sculpture, in good preservation, dug out of the ruins of Herculaneum; and supported by an elegant modern therm, designed by Sir William Chambers. Over the book-cases on the east side, are the subsequent paintings and sculptures. Lord Godolphin. D ke of Montague. Above the first chimney, a bust of Charles Earl of Sunderland, the collector of the books: \u2014 below this, a sea piece of Jonah and the Whale, after Poussin . \u2014 and on the chimney, a bust of the Emperor Adrian.

Elizabeth Duchess of Marlborough. Charles Duke of Marlborough."], [70, "48 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. Sarah Duchess of Marlborough. John Duke of Marlborough. Over the second chimney, a Girl's Head, antique. \u2014 A Landscape, after Poussin ; above, a bust of Charles Duke of Marlbo rough, by Rysbrack. Queen Anne. King William. From the noble bow-windows on the west, is an elysian prospect of the beauti fully waving descent to the lake, and of the pendent groves on the opposite hill. Indeed every apartment has its appropriate beauties, both internal and external: the eye of taste will recognize many which the brevity of our plan prevented us from noting; to the more cursory observer this description will prove an useful monitor. One striking ornament, however, we have neglected to remark : the Mahogany Doors throughout this whole suite are splendidly finished, and are worthy of the apartments to which they conduct. When open, they form a magnificent vista from the Library to the Grand Cabinet. XIV. CHAPEL. From the library we proceed along a"], [71, "paintings, &C 49 piazza, with arcades below, to the Chapel, situated in the western wing of the palace. The coup d'\u0153il on entering is extremely grand, and the impression such as corre sponds with the place. The style of paint ing, and the degree of light, are both pe culiarly happy : the large compartments of sober gray are finely relieved by the sur rounding white; and the shade of foliage that partially darkens the windows, diffuses an air of composed solemnity, unmixed Vvith gloom, unaccompanied with melan choly. The chief ornament; however, is a stately Monument in various marble, to the memory of the first Duke and Duchess, by Rysbrack. They are represented with their two Sons, who died young*, as supported by Fame and History : these are colossal figures, and being most prominent, are the most striking in the group. The pen of History seems to have traced this inscrip tion on a tablet, which she holds in the other hand: \u2022 The eldest son of the great Duke of Marlborough, John Marcjula of Blandford, died of the small pox, at Cambridge, in the 17th year of his age; and lies buried in one of the aisles of King's College Chapel, where a magnificent altar tomb is erected to his memorj.

Beneath is the taking of Marshal Tal lard, in basso relievo. Under this, is the family vault, to which there is an opening from the stable-court. The altar-piece represents our Saviour taking down from the Cross, by Jordaens of Antwerp. The gallery for the family is splendidly hung with crimson velvet, fringed with gold. The cushions are corresponding. Over the chimney is a curious painting on black marble, by Alessandro Veronese. TITIAN ROOM. This apartment adjoins the Theatre, near the entrance of the Gardens, and is ornamented with a superb collection of paintings by Titian ; a magnificent present from Victor Amadeus, King of Sardinia, to John Duke of Marlborough. These capital performances of this cele-"], [73, "paintings, &c. 51 brated master, after long lying hid from public view, are now liberally displayed, chiefly, for the sake of amateurs in the pictorial art. They consist of the follow ing series and are painted on leather. I. Mars and Venus. II. Cupid and Psyche. III. Apollo and Daphne. IV. Pluto and Proserpine. V. Hercules and Dejanira. VI. Vulcan and Ceres. VII. Bacchus and Ariadne. VIII. Jupiter, Juno, and lo. IX. Neptune and Amphitrite. These figures, which far exceed the size of nature, though they are little encum bered with drapery, cover three sides of the room, and form almost a school of themselves. It has been remarked, how ever, that Titian is not happy in expressing female beauty, though he had goddesses to delineate. Indeed, his taste in design is by no means equal to the spirit of his execu tion and the beauty of his colouring. H 2"], [74, "52 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. CHINA GALLERY*. This elegant fabric, erected purposely for the reception of the superb collection of porcelain now deposited here, stands close to the Home Lodge, and is separated from the Park by iron palisadoes. It was fitted up in the year 1796; and presents an additional attraction to the visitors of Blenheim, who delight in the antique, rich, and curious specimens of the porcelain, dels, and japan manufacture. But it is not the connoisseur only who will be gratified by this display; \u2014 no eye of taste can fail to receive satisfaction from the sight of this splendid collection; nor will the arrangement pass unregarded by the most superficial observer. The gallery, whose external figure re presents a cross, is divided into five com partments. The two rooms at each end are fitted up in an octagonal form, and lighted from the top, with the porcelain regularly arranged on slight pilasters, or fancifully suspended \u2022 This choice collection was formed by a Mr. Spalding, during his travels for several years on the Continent, as well as his attendance on sales in this country, and was presented by him, on certain con ditions, as an appcndant to Blenheim."], [75, "53 CHINA GALLERY. by brass hooks, against the walls. The centre room, which occupies the transverse of the cross, is circular, and has a light in the form of a dome in the middle, and a smaller one on each side. This apartment is particularly magnificent. Round the walls are ten pannels and twelve pilasters, filled with choice specimens; and at a proper distance in the area, are eight pilas ters and six open stands, with a pyramidal pagoda in the centre, supporting many pieces of singular value or beauty. The whole gallery may be seen at the first entry; and, from the reflected light, the distribution of parts, and the splendor of the materials, which are here displayed to the greatest advantage, it may not inaptly be compared to the fanciful descriptions of enchanted palaces, in poesy and romance. This assemblage of ancient porcelain consists of an immense quantity of both useful and ornamental articles, in every species of that elegant manufacture, from the earliest a<res till the art is said to have been lost. Some specimens exhibit its in fant state, which, according to the Abb\u00a3 Raynal, in his History of the Indies, may be reasonably- supposed to be three thousand"], [76, "54 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. years ago. The remote antiquity of these may be inferred, from the rudeness of the designs, and the imperfect crackled ap pearance of the baking. It is long before art can be brought to any degree of per fection. To glaze and bake in the high stile of many pieces in this collection, must have required i-eiterated attempts, and the experience of years \u2014 perhaps of ages. Aiv.ong other varieties, are many of the choicest pieces of the old blue and white, and pale japan brown edge, so much esteem ed by the curious. Likewise a numerous assortment of those very scarce and valuable sorts, the antique bleu celeste, and deep purple. It is impossible, however, to enter into a minute description of articles so various and extensive; but we cannot refrain from particularizing a few, and enumei-ating the principal sources from which they were drawn, by the ingenious and indefatigable Collector. Among many other pieces deserving at tention, are a pair of small bottles, once the property of Queen Anne \u2014 A large japan tea-pot, a present from Louis XIV. to the Duke of Richelieu \u2014 Two smaller ones from"], [77, "CHINA GALLERY. 55 the Collection of the Duke of Orleans, father to Egalite \u2014 Some pieces from the late Princess Amelia's Cabinet \u2014 Many from the Portland Museum, and from the cele brated collection of the Duke d'Aumont at Paris \u2014 A singular piece from the Duke of Argyle's curiosities, in the former reign \u2014 Several articles from the late Duchess of Kingston's \u2014 from Selima, Countess of Hun tingdon's \u2014 from M.

A large white tea-pot, once in the possession of Oliver Cromwell, will be deemed a cu riosity; and it is not uninteresting to ob serve the different forms of the tea-pots in general in this gallery, the metamorphoses they have undergone, and their variations from the present prevailing shape.\u2014 Two pieces of jasper China, somewhat resem bling shells, are remarkably beautiful and rare, as are several of that scarce sort, called honeycomb. It should also be ob served, that some specimens are unique in their kind. A collateral room, adjoining the en-"], [78, "56 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. trance to the gallery, is filled with scarce and elegant specimens of Roman and old earthen ware, too numerous to mention. A dels jar of the latter kind was evidently fabricated, long before the Dutch threw off the Spanish yoke, as appears from the dress of the figures \u2014 But one of the most singular curiosities, is a small piece repre senting a fish, which was brought from Athens, and is supposed to be coeval with that celebrated republic. In this apartment, likewise, is a small select collection of the finest old black and gold wooden japan; \u2014 and a numerous and beautiful assortment of old copper enamels of the black and white kind, and also in various colours, on subjects both sacred and profane, some of them not unworthy of the pencil of Raphael. These slight notices may suffice to shew the value and extent of this collection. The curious, and real amateurs, will satisfy them selves as to its peculiar merits. GARDENS. The gardens, or pleasure grounds, oc* cupy an area of two hundred acres, and upwards. On part of the north, and the"], [79, "57 GARDENS. east side, they are surrounded by a sunk fence, which, without breaking the gran deur of the scene, serves to separate the parts that compose it. On the west side, they make a bold descent to the lake, which falling over a rocky barrier of considerable height at the south-west angle, formed likewise the southern boundary, before the more recent additions of a considerable portion of the adjoining vale, and of the face of the opposite hill. Nature, indeed, seems to have placed this fine chain, which describes the figure of a bow on the west and south of the river, as the only regular termination of the pleasure grounds, and the line of demarcation between them and the park. The lofty umbrageous trees, which cover its side and brow, form a noble back-ground, and give an unity and finish to the scene. The features of the vale, likewise, through which the river winds, from the cascade as far as the new bridge, entirely correspond with the rest of the picture : art might heighten them, but nature could not have been more propi tious; they invite embellishment from the facility with which it might be applied. Or may it not be an effect of the justest I"], [80, "58 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. taste, to render the transition from the more ornamental style of the garden to the first shades of the ruder majesty of the park, so very imperceptible, that the eye, at a small distance, cannot determine where the one commences and the other ends? In animate nature, the close alliance be tween the last genus of one class and the first of another, has been ever considered as an instance of beauteous design and harmonious connection ; and why may not the same hold good in inanimate objects ? The just gradation of tints, and the easy blending of colours, are indisputably re quisite to the composition of a perfect whole! The usual entrance into the Gardens is a little to the left of the eastern trate of O Blenheim, the usual approach. The East Front first salutes the view, \u2014 a chaste and elegant piece of architecture, with a large projecting bow in the centre: before it spreads a cheerful lawn of an oblong form, extending a considerable way into the park; at fii-st fringed with little clumps of evergreens, encircled and intei-spersed with flowers and deciduous shrubs: then broken by a few scattered trees, which, rising on"], [81, "59 GARDENS. different sides of the boundary, effectually conceal it; and afterwards lined by stately trees, that throw a finely chequered shade on the verdant sward below, and ranging in irregular pomp, preclude stiffness from mingling with beauty. A walk of pebbly gravel, of the most beautiful texture and l-egularity (which however prevails in the pleasure-grounds, and blends utility- with ornament) winding to the east, between rising plantations and clumps of trees and shrubs in various shape, at intervals is opened to highly embellished lawn; and soon taking an easy bend to the south, conducts to the Temple of Health, charged with the following elegant and loyal inscription, on a highly polished niaible tablet : DEO MAXIMO CONSERVATORI, ET PROVIDENTI\u00c6 DIVIN\u00c6: OB RECUPERATAM GEORGII TERT1I, REGIS OPTIMI, PIENTISSIMI SAI.UTEM, HOC MARMOR GEORGIUS DUX MARLBURIENSIS EXPLETO DESIDERIO, VOTIQUE COMPOS, \u00bbN AI.IQUOD GRATI ANIMI TESTIMON1UM, L\u00c6TUS, I.UBENSiiUE DEDICAV1T.

It emerges from a small thicket, which backs it and deter mines its site, and without imposing the idea of solitude, renders it sufficiently se questered. Before we reach this temple, the Triumphal Arch and Woodstock Tower are seen in pleasing perspective. From hence, the scene gradually changes. In stead of embellished lawn, we become em bosomed in tre?s of venerable majesty. The park and gardens seem to unite, or rather their distinction is lost. The trim ness of the walk, and the occasional sight of evergreens, alone discriminate the latter. The parts unite, And strength of shade contends with strength of light. Open grove, at an agreeable distance, on each side, continues for a considerable space. The whole is a delightful Home- walk, sheltered by the winding of its direction from every blast: possessing sufficient va riety in every part, with an aspect continu ally improving. From this pleasing route, however, we are drawn aside to the contemplation of the"], [83, "GARDENS. 61 Flower Garden. A diverticle from the principal walk, near an ornamental tripod, inclines to a thick grove on the right, in which this elysian spot is placed. In our progress, the trees form an embowering shade ; \u2014 as we enter, \u2014 they range in aniphitheatric pride, and pre sent a reclining face of foliage, from the ground to a vast height above. The sud den burst of so much beauty strikes the eye: the music of the spray delights the ear; \u2014 the fragrance recreates the other senses: images of tranquil joy fix their fairest impi-essions on the mind ; and if they cannot efface the remembrance of ills, they soothe it into resignation. See waving woods their aged arms display, And quivering sun-beams shed a partial day: Long vistas shooting from the wondering eyes, And bloom perennial pour unnumber'd dyes! See stower-crown'd Flora spread her lucid train, And give to Beauty all the smiling plain; While sylvan Pan, amid the shady trees, Joins in the concert with the swelling breeze.

The outline is elegant; the execution charming; the accompaniments are judi cious. In the centre of variously arranged bou quets, which the bosom of the earth sup ports, is an Obelisk of porphyry, surround ed with four white marble vases, filled with annual flowers; on the north is a neat Temple, properly dedicated to Flora ; and during the summer months, every interstice left by the trunks of the sur rounding grove is replenished with oranges, lemons, and other exotic trees, shrubs, and plants of the greatest delicacy and the richest odour, which ranking in natural progression before the permanent vegeta tive tribes, seem also the denizens of the spot. Groves whose rich trees weep odorous gums and balm, Others whose fruit, burnish'd with golden rind, Hang amiable, Hesperian fables true, If true, here only. Milton. There are different outlets through the grove: but to proceed in the regular tour, we take that near the south-eastangle; and, after being embosomed in trees for a few paces, the scene opens to the left, but soon"], [85, "GARDENS. 63 shuts again with aggravated gloom. The trees become so thick and umbrageous, that the meridian sun only playrs on their tops, or permeates an accidental break. The sweet smelling lime, the dark chesnut, and the airy beech, with evergreens below, bear the chief proportion here. AU is still \u2014 all is solemn. The contrast with the flower garden is very striking; with the view that soon opens extremely captivating. Kitchen Gardens. The Palladian gate, orenti-ance into the Kitchen Gardens, appears on the east; and the eye darts over a cheerful landscape to the south. On this side, the walls of the kitchen gardens, which are fourteen feet high, are concealed by irregular plant ations of laurels and other shrubs, thinly scattered with forest trees. From the gate, we trace their vast extent, clothed with the choicest fruit trees ; we beliold an area of eight acres, while four more remain unseen, furnished with evei-y article of culinary use, or of elegance in the dessert, and replete with every requisite appendage for bringing it to perfection. The Hot Houses are constructed on an excellent principle, and"], [86, "64 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. produce the finest pines and grapes. Alt here amply supplies the want of a warmer sky. The Conservatory occupies an angle fronting the south. Falling into the Home-walk at this place, the deviation from which has been previously mentioned, we soon enter the Sheep- walk, which is half a mile in length, and through its whole extent abounding with rural imagery. Frequently covered with a flock of more than a thousand sheep, all of the most beautiful and valua ble, and some of the most curious breeds, this space, though possessing features of characteristic negligence, is not less rich, or less animated than the most favourite spots in the gaiden. The open gi-ove winds away to the right, and on this hand we catch a glimpse of the south front of the Palace, which is thrown into various perspective as we advance. In other directions we enjoy a picturesque view of Beckley Hill, just peeping over the in tervening heights; of Witham's lofty woods rising to the summit of Botley, where the trees range in solitary state; and through"], [87, "GARDENS. 65 the long perspective of a rich champaign, in which Ensham Tower forms a very con- spicuous object, when illumined with a morning sun, the distant White Horse Hills are seen to elevate themselves into a back-ground. Nor are remote pictures alone attractive at this hour: the deep shade that darkens the neighbouring village of Bladon, is finely contrasted with the level beams that glance on the water below. At every changing season of the day-, in- deed, some new beauty is developed, or the scenes are thrown into a different per- spective, by the aid of light and shade. The evening sun is not less propitious than the morning, for giving a brilliant effect to objects, in this delightful perambulation. Proceeding, \u2014 in one place, the New Bridge, as it is called, appears broken and ruinous by the bend of a tree that overhangs the bank; in another it shews its arches entire, and even the lower visible reach of water is seen sparkling through its balus trades; farther the centre arch alone is perceptible ; and sometimes the whole is lost. Such is the effect of grouping and combining! The lawn is sprinkled with beautiful groups octrees: the majestic oak, K"], [88, "66 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. with pendent inclination to the stream, is the frequent ornament of the slope. About the middle of this walk, the top of Handborough Spire, though neai-ly three miles off, appears emerging from the bosom of the deep wood beyond the lake; and close on the right is seen the Shepherd's Cot, a little thatched edifice, composed of the trunks of trees fancifully arranged, backed by a clump, and shaded by horse-chesnuts in front. Near this spot, we may pause to contem plate the beauties which the changing scene displays. Nothing can be more picturesque than Bladon when gilded with an evening sun : the battlemented tower, and here and there the end of a building, glow with the crimson of his beams ; or the window, par tially shaded by intervening trees, reflects them like living fire. Claude would have caught the tints with rapture; he would have combined the objects into a picture ; and on its effect he might have rested the immortality of his fame."], [89, "67 gardens. Cascade and its Accompaniments. A little beyond the ShepherJ's Cot is the first opening of the Cascade ; and for some space it forms a principal attraction. The water seems to bui-st from the deep wood that bounds the head ; its coui-se is totally hid by the bend, by the figure of the banks, and the effect of plantation. Every step we descend towards the cascade^ the embellishments thicken, the scene be comes more illustrious. Groups of acacia, cedar, poplar, chesnut, and beech, deco rate the declivity down to the river; and beyond it, at a proportionate distance, the back-ground, as far as the commencement of the new Garden, is adorned with a pro fusion of hawthorns, surmounted by noble pendent trees, which, stretching round as far as the eye can reach, terminate in the near horizon. But before we sink into the vale, it will not be unpleasing to take a retrospective view of the landscape we are leavingbehind. The lofty spire of Kidlington church seems to belong to the park ; the distant bills formerly observed, are cast into dif ferent perspective; and a new and wider k 2"], [90, "68 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. range is displayed, farther than the natural vision can distinguish objects, and till the blue hills of Buckinghamshire close with the bounding sky. Among these, Ashridge, the seat of the Earl of Bridgwater, may be ascertained in a clear day. The obelisk of the Fountain soon peeps between a little woody island and the cas cade ; and the grand River, which a few paces before was invisible, bursts at once on the eye in a broad sheet, without ap parent continuity or connection. Before we reach the termination of the sheep-walk, we lose the cascade on the left; to it, how ever, we at last descend, between clumps and groups of the most luxuriantund deli cate trees of various climes, intermixed with flowers and shrubs of the utmost fra grance and beauty. The ground, which at first is highest on the left, soon assumes a determined superiority on the right. It is thrown into masses with a masterly hand; it has received every embellishment that refined taste can confer on natural beauty; and we enjoy the touch of art, without waking the idea that revolts at its flaunting display."], [91, "69 GARDENS. Here various trees compose a chcqucr'd scene, Glowing in gay diversities of green; There the full stream thro' intermingling glades, Shines a broad lake, or falls in loud cascades. In the vicinity of the Cascade, whose sides are finely- shaded, the water is quite lost above. Even from the bridge that fronts it at fifty feet distance, we only see the fall, without tracing the supply. The charming reach below appears in its most varied features from this bridge, which connects the gardens: and when ihe full stream devolves from the rocky barrier, and bounds from one point to another in foamy pride with deafening roar, nothing can be more grateful to a contemplative mind than such a scene, and such a situation. Down the steep fall devolve the foaming tides. Unfading verdure clothes th' aspiring sides. Emblem of life ! where waves on waves arise.

Following the course of the river ort the left, we soon reach Newfound Well, a mineral spring of the chalybeate. kind, said to possess very- active virtues, before they were weakened by the expansion of the lake, whose waters are now supposed to mix with it. In the front of a dark clump rises a pedestal supporting an urn, and from an aperture in the former gushes the spring; and being received into an antique bason, charged with numerous fancy figures, in allo relievOj much injured, flows out near the top by the mouths of two lions, and quickly mixes with the river. Again we have a view of the New Bridge, and of a serpentine reach of water, embracing the island, and gliding on with glassy smooth^ ness. The Fountain next attracts our notice. There River-Oods reclin'd, at ease explore A scene more lovely than their native shore; Confess Hesperia boasts no charms that vie With the bright landscapes which around them lie. It is situated at the bottom of the hill, and forms an object not unworthy of its place and destination. In the centre of an"], [93, "GARDENS. 71 elegant capacious bason, where marble dolphins seem to sport, stands the base, formed of a species of porous stone, per? meable by the water, and thrown together in rude pomp, with a cavern from east to west, from which appear to issue a lion and a sea-horse, the attributes of Europe and Africa, finely7 designed. On the four extremities of the rock, which supports the obelisk, are four River- Gods, sculptured in white marble, with a delicacy and expression not to be surpassed. These are intended to represent the Danube, the Nile, the La Plata, and the Ganges, the four principal rivers of the different quarters of the globe. The Danube rests his right leg on an oar* \u2014 The Nile veils his head with classical propriety \u2014 The AMERI CAN River-God lifts up his left-hand and eyes in surprise, as if first made known to the rest of the world \u2014 The Asiatic River- God, with a placid look, stretches out his hand to a serpent crawling, and to a shell.

The following arms appear on one side of the base of the obelisk ; \u2014 under a coronet in a bordure of lions and castles, per saltier, for Castile and Leon, two baskets and five. On the opposite side, in a bordure of sal tiers, under a coronet, two wolves, with lambs in their mouths.

This fine piece of sculpture, the last work of Bernini, and a copy- from the magnifi cent fountain in the Piazza Navona at"], [95, "GARDENS. 73 Rome, was a present from the Spanish am bassador at the Papal court, to the first Duke of Marlborough. It has only been recently erected; and during the many years it lay neglected, was much damaged, and part of its characteristic appendages and adjuncts lost. Still, however, it bears a close resemblance to the noble original ; proves an ornament to the gardens, and, the admiration of spectators. From the Fountain, the path meanders up hill. The left is open to the charming vale through which the river glides: the right is occasionally shaded by groups of trees. Almost every step presents a new scene: the transitions are sudden, but never harsh; even the strong- contrast between the ele- gant sculpture we have just left, and the wild Rock Seats that occupy the brow, gives an additional impression to each. Above these is a noble view into the park : the High Lodge, with its antique battle^ ments amidst an amphitheatre of venerable trees, is a striking object in the landscape. From this spot we wind to the right, and fresh beauties again arrest the attention, L"], [96, "74 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. To paint every change of scenery that pre sents itself in the space of an hundred yards would be impossible; the impression can only be conveyed by the eye; \u2014 the happiest description would fail. At one point we have a glimpse of the river; at another per haps it is lost ; the turrets of the Palace just emerge; an expanse of water with a forest line of wood draws the view ; and, at a few paces distance, the Palace, the river, the two principal bridges, and the fine terrace on the west of the gardens, all burst with irresistible beauty and attraction. At this spot, the sublime predominates in a very high degree; and frigid indeed must that taste be, which will not feel and con fess the energy of the scene. When the rising sun throws its horizontal rays on the gilded orbs of Blenheim, the tops of the trees catch his radiance, and the withdraw ing shade lightly floats on the surface of the lake; nature does not furnish a picture of more brilliancy than this. A little farther, and the intervening groups allow only glimpses ; \u2014 again the prospect opens, the park displays its syl van honours on the north, and on the east, the Chiltern hills bound the sight. At the"], [97, "GARDENS. 75 Utmost extent of vision is Winchendon, formerly the seat of the Duke of Wharton, now the property of the Marlborough family. There is something grand in the idea : the vast space between is swallowed up ; and fancy combining the distant do mains in the same landscape, gives a sanc tion and a solution to the magnificence around. On the right, as we turn down towards the Iron-Bridge, stands 1'Arrotino, or as it is usually called, the Listening Slave, a fine cast in bronze from the antique, by Benzi. Descending to the river, from distant views the transition becomes instan taneous to near ones. The water is seen flowing round to the cascade : the bank on the right is abrupt and rocky, chiefly planted with sumach ; on the left, it is adorned with the fairest rising plantations, which are yearly rendering the spot more characteristically romantic. \u25a0all around Umbrageous grots, and caves of cool recess, And murmuring waters down the slope dispers'd.

On the Blenheim side of the Iron-Bridge, the cascade and its accompaniments a\u00bb-e wholly lost ; the former can only be traced by its murmurs and its dashing. The walk now runs along the left of the upper river : the lower is scarcely perceptible. Even the inferior path, by which we descend from the sheep- walk to the cascade, though only a few yards below, is rendered entirely distinct, by the figure of the ground, and the groups that adorn it. As we advance to the angle of the sheep-walk, the ground becomes gradually more elevated. Beyond, the broad expanse of water on the left, a fine outline of pendent wood stretches along to an indeterminate length ; on the other hand is highly decorated lawn. The Ter race may be said to commence at this point; and its captivating charms are gra dually developed as we proceed. From a moderate elevation above the level of the lake, it rises to a bold declivity, feathered down to the brink with majestic trees, in terspersed with plantations of younger growth, grouped and arranged in the most enchanting style ; while the wild forest that clothes the opposite bank is reflected in the crystal tide below. The lake is usually"], [99, "77 GARDENS. farther enlivened with various pleasure vessels, disposed in such a manner as may best adorn this illustrious scene. Behind is a delightful perspective of the back ground on the south-west; and the cascade glit ters in all its grandeur. As we approximate the level of the ter race, the shaft of CHURCHILL's Pillar appears in front above the surrounding trees ; by degrees it opens to its very base. The dark gi-oves in the northern part of the park begin to display themselves; and couched in the front of one, the celebrated Bath of ROSAMOND may be dimly discerned. The water too assumes a variety of figures; the outline becomes more indented; and a collateral branch of undefined extent, run ning up a deep vale from the principal stream, without appearing to derive its sole importance from it, has the pleasing effect of seeming to augment its current. Ditchley Woods form the horizon : these fall into the back-ground of the scene, at a distance sufficient forgreatness, and without any disjunction of parts. Here we reach the Temple of Diana, which stands on the summit of the decli-"], [100, "78 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. vity. \u2014 We survey the landscape with rap ture \u2014 we confess the ne plus ultra of pictu resque embellishment.

The intersecting walks generally retire from the sight, but are never wanting for necessary communication : they conduct to the principal subordinate scenes ; they oc- cupy the happiest spaces. By following their direction, we are sure of meeting with some object in our progress to com- pensate for the toil ; some beauty is dis- closed which would otherwise be lost; or scenes are thrown in perspective, or heightened by contrast, in a manner dif ferent from what we observed before. The occasional recurrence also of the garden chair, the plain bench, or the cir cular seat round the trunk of some umbra geous tree, by presenting opportunities for rest, prevent the idea of lassitude. Thus, in our journey through life, it is not always the actual use of the accommodations we possess, that adds to our comfort ; it is the reflection that we may command them in, the hour of need, and that we have it in"], [103, "GARDENS. 81 our power to gratify the wish as soon as it is felt. But these are not simply objects of ornament or convenience ; they generally point out scenes which repose may con template with delight, and fancy combine into picture. Here a thousand beauties, originating from design, appear fortuitous to the eye. Though traversing a garden where taste has exhausted its skill, we incessantly indulge the idea of being only contemplating the natural charms of the country, and tracing delights of rich variety and unlimited ex tent. In this tour, indeed, we have omitted many circumstances which in an inferiorplace would have deservedly claimed regard. Here littleness is absorbed in grandeur, and prettiness in magnificence. This marks the prevailing character; and should it ever, in the minutest instance, be sacrificed to its opposite, Blenheim will lose that prin cipal beauty \u2014 consistency, though it may borrow the fairest flowers from the garland of novelty. Of this, however, there is no danger. The character of this place is novr sufficiently established in the public estima tion; and its acknowledged superiority ia M"], [104, "82 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM. natural charms and highly embellished land scape, is attested by the annually- increasing number of visitors.

THE River, which covers the whole ex tent of a spacious valley, bending in the happiest style, and affording the most pro fuse variety of picturesque features in the sublime, the beautiful, and the tranquil, when viewed with its accompaniments, is indisputably the most superb piece of arti ficial water in this kingdom. It is chiefly \u2022 If the words rieer and lake are sometimes applied to the same thin-, it is hoped the reader will not impute this to ignorance or error : the water at Blenheim partakes of the nature of both ; it is a River, because it has a progressive motion ; it is also a Lake, because it spreads far beyond its original channel. Thus uniting the distin guishing beauties and characteristics of each, it rises to the pre-emi nence of sublimity in kind. It is proper, however, to remark, that it generally receives the name of the Lake from its commencement to the grand bridge, and of the Great IVatcr down to the cascade. \u2014 The whole is stocked with abuudance of fine fish, such as pike, perch, carp, &c. &c.

From the bridge, a most capital expanse of water again catches the eye ; an expanse unrivalled by the finest English rivers, un mixed with the sea; and which, washing the remote banks, varies with their direc tion ; makes a long diversion up a vale that forms a right angle with its bed, and affords the representation of a collateral stream : then rolling a seemingly enlarged volume, \u2022 This is part of the ancient causeway leading to the old Manor House, which stood about 100 yards farther north. 1 Brown, who superintended the early improvements here, in his usual consequential manner, has been heard to boast, '\u2022 That th\u00ab Thames would never forgive him for what he had done at Blenheim.\" Had he lived to the present time, he would have been sensible how much his most finished labors may be surpassed."], [107, "85 RIVER, it winds round, and washes the foot of the declivity, on which part of the gardens lie; and on the other side it is bounded by a considerable hill, feathered down with a noble wood to the water's edge, and fre quently reflected on its surface.

At the point where it appears embayed, it passes under a light iron bridge, simple and unadorned, and characteristic of its destination; and making a pretty sudden bend, it tumbles down a barrier of massy rocks, with a force equal to its copiousness; and with a fall of eighteen feet perpen dicular, and twenty-seven with the angle it forms. Above this cascade, are an hun dred and fifty acres of water: below, it is a continuation of an hundred more. Recovering its level, the river flows with a serpentine sweep through an expanded vale, embellished with scattered groups of flourishing young plantation; and at an agreeable distance, stretches another face of the hill already mentioned as a boundary, covered with trees whose pendency and age render them at once picturesque and vene rable. But though in this reach the river admits an oval woody islet, its channel be comes now more contracted than before ; and its style partakes rather of the beautiful than the sublime. Reaching the New Bridge, a very elegant modern structure, it inclines with the course of the vale, and touching near Bladon, makes a determined bend to the right. The banks on both sides at this"], [109, "RIVER, 87 point are swelling lawn, with little clumps, connected by single trees, disposed with out the least shew of intention, but uniting to produce the happiest effect. From hence, the river takes a variety of charming turns, chiefly with a strong incli nation to the right, doubling as it were on itself, and circumscribing the extremity of the hill which accompanies it the greatest part of its course. In one place a fine sheet of water spreads before the eye, and in vites progress by its apparent continuity; in another, the trees seem to embay it, and we advance a considerable way, before we can detect the deception. From the first determined sweep near Bladon, a gravel walk on the left follows the direction of the river. This walk is bounded on one side by a belt of thick plantation; on the other, a few scattered trees range with the stream. Beyond the river, we are charmed with all the diversity of pleasing scenery : a small grove first presents itself, close to the verge of the tide ; a few irre gular trees next succeed ; sometimes a clump planted at the termination of a reach, by advancing to the belt on the opposite shore, appears to land-lock the stream ; then"], [110, "88 DESCRIPTION OF BLENHEIM*. again we are delighted with open lawn and divers si d landsc; pe. At last, the river passing under a low bridge with numerous arches, precipitates itself down a steep cas cade, and at the same instant falls into the Evenlode*, which gliding.in an opposite direction through verdant meads, winds under the park to receive the tributary Glyme. The united rivers forming a woody island immediately after their junction, meander through a continuation of meads, and dispense beauty- and fertility, as they flow to join the classic Isis. The effect occasioned by two rivers hastening to meet each other, and then bending almost at right angles with their former course, is as pleasing as it is singular and romantic.
