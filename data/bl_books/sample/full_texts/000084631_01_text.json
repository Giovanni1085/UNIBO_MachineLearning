Mobile, at the commencement of the war, contained a population of thirty thousand. It is situated on low ground, at the mouth of Mobile river \u2014 formed by the Alabama and Tombigbee \u2014 and at the head and western shore of the bay bearing the same name. Having communication the year round, by rivers as well as by railroads, into the heart of Alabama and Mississippi, it was regarded as one of the keys of the Confederacy. Socially, politically, and commercially, except that its com merce was smaller, it resembled New Orleans ; and between the cities there was considerable cordiality. The liberalizing influence of commerce had tended to foster a fraternal and national spirit, and it was among the last Southern cities to renounce the Union. Douglas had been welcomed there with enthusiasm in 1860, and received a large vote in the presi dential election. After the passage of the ordinance of secession, it was deemed essential that the orator Yancey should visit Mobile"], [20, "10 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. to reconcile the people to the new government. He urged, among other things, that, under the Confederacy, their com merce would take more ample wings ; and that the only dan ger to be dreaded would be the excess of wealth and luxury which would follow. But once committed to the confederate cause, the people were active and zealous in contributing to its success. They cheerfully rendered military service, and gave the labor of their slaves in constructing defensive works. These being earned on with skill and industry, grew more formidable every year. They tended to avert attack, and gave the city the distinction of being the last important place in the Confederacy which was captured. Once, only, did the people murmur. West of the city, on rising ground, was a fine forest of oak and evergreen. Drives through it afforded pleasant refuge from the tropic heat of the town ; and thither excursions were made in the long summer for relaxation. The engineer decided that this forest must be cut down, and it was done. But the citizens made indignant complaints on account of it. Fortifications of Mobile. \u2014 Gen. Joseph E. Johnston pronounced Mobile to be the best-fortified place in the Confederacy. The first continuous line of earthworks around the city was made in 1862, under Capt. Lieurner, about three miles out from the business streets, and comprised fifteen redoubts. This line was, for the most part, upon ground about one hundred feet higher than the city. After the fall of Vicksburgh, the apprehension of an attack stimulated the defensive operations, and the year 1863 wit nessed the completion, by Gen. Leadbetter, of a second line of works, built nearer the city, and in fact passing through the suburbs. It included sixteen enclosed and strong forts. This rendered the defences so formidable that it was estimated a"], [21, "CAMPAIGN OP MOBILE. 11 garrison of ten thousand effective troops could hold the city ninety days against a besieging army of forty thousand. Another and still stronger Line of works was constructed in 1864, about halfway between the other two. This hne, built by Lieut.-Col. V. Sheliha, included nineteen heavy bastioned forts and eight redoubts. The parapets of these forts were from twenty to thirty feet thick, the ditches about twenty feet deep, and thirty feet or thereabouts in width. Harbor Fortifications. \u2014 Nor were the works ordinary which had been prepared to resist an attack by water. Just below the city were ten batteries to sweep the channel. Two of these were floating. Long rows of piles had been driven to obstruct the channel ; and though an opening was here and there left through which vessels might cautiously pass, yet they would almost have to hug the muzzles of heavy guns which at every such outlet threatened destruction. Such were the obstacles on the Spanish river channel, the usual route. On the eastern shore of the bay vessels could pass up the Appalachee river and come round through the Tensas, arriving in front of Mobile, clear of the obstructions before mentioned. But to close this route Batteries Huger and Tracy had been built on low ground close to the river, and piles had also been driven across the channel ; and in (lifferent parts of the bay many torpedoes had been planted. But the principal barrier against attack by water, up to the summer of 1864, had been Eorts Morgan and Gaines. These imposing walled forts stood at the entrance of the bay, four miles apart, and afforded protection to blockade-runners. They had been built by the United States, but were seized and taken possession of by the confederates as early as January, 1861. Fort Gaines was built in star-fashion, mounting thirty guns, and garrisoned by nine hundred men. Fort Morgan was built on a grander scale, armed with sixty powerful guns, and had a"], [22, "12 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. water battery in its front. Besides these was Fort Powell, near Cedar point, built to command Grant's pass \u2014 an inconsiderable and incomplete work, and mounting only eight guns. In the channel in front of Fort Morgan, and not more than a mile dis tant from it, four hundred torpedoes had been planted. But the current there is strong, and only one of them was ever known to cause any damage. Thus was Mobile hemmed about with grim preparations against an adversaiy. And besides these fortifications, there was no inconsiderable confederate navy lurking in the harbor. The ram Tennessee, that afterward made a frightful dash at the Hartford, and the gunboats Gaines, Morgan, Selma, and other vessels, had by their menacing attitude created some apprehen sion of an attempt to raise the blockade ; and the federal gov ernment felt the necessity of Farragut's presence there. He was therefore ordered to resume command of the western gulf squad ron, which he did ; and arrived off Mobile on the 18th of Jan uary, 1864."], [23, "CHAPTER II. EARLIER OPERATIONS AGAINST MOBILE. Assuming that the Ked river expedition would be successful, Grant, on the 31st of March, 1864, in a despatch to Banks, expressed the opinion that after reserving a force sufficient to guard the Mississippi river he (Banks) would have left, accord ing to the last returns, a force of over thirty thousand effective men with which to move against Mobile ; to which he expected to add five thousand men from Missouri. \"If, however,\" he continued, \"you think the force here stated too small to hold the territory regarded as necessary to hold possession of, I would say concentrate at least twenty-five thousand men of your present command for operations against Mobile, with these and such other additions as I can give you from elsewhere lose no time in making a demonstration, to be followed by an attack on Mobde.\" The reverses along the Red river prevented these instructions from being carried into effect. Gen. Canby assumed command of the military division of West Mississippi on the 11th of May. He brought with him instructions to carry out, if possible, the contemplated movement against Mobile. But the recent suc cess of the confederates west of the Mississippi increased their spirit so much that they at once assumed the aggressive. Kirby Smith's combined forces did not fall much short of sixty thou sand men. He threatened several points on the Mississippi and the whole line of the Arkansas. It was necessary, therefore, to postpone the contemplated operations against Mobile, all the"], [24, "14 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. movable forces being required to guard the Mississippi. It had been contemplated also to renew operations on Red river, but Canby became satisfied that the troops could be used to better advantage east of the Mississippi. He was also called on to send six thousand men of the Nineteenth corps by sea from New Orleans to Washington when the latter place was threatened, and the movement being executed with promptitude and secresy they reached there at a most opportune moment. But although the federal army was yet unable to assail Mobile, that place was destined to receive a tremendous blow from the navy, in the reduction of those frowning citadels that guarded the bay and harbor. Farragut's heroic and magnifi cent naval engagement with Forts Morgan and Gaines and the confederate monitors, on the 5th of August, 1864, is a familiar and memorable event, and some mention of it should here be made including the operations of the land forces. On that day, Fort Powell was blown up and evacuated; on the 8th, Fort Gaines surrendered with its garrison, and on the 23d, the federal ensign was once more hoisted over Fort Morgan. Bombardment and Siege of Forts Morgan and Gaines. \u2014 At eleven o'clock of the night of August 2, Gen. Gordon Granger arrived off Santa Rosa Island, with fifteen hundred effective men, consisting of the Seventy-seventh Blinois, Thirty-fourth Iowa, Ninety-sixth Ohio, Third Maryland dismounted cavalry, and Cobb's colored regiment of engineers, the whole under the immediate command of Brig.-Gen. McGinnis. After Granger had consulted with Admiral Farragut, the troops, on the 3d, moved up to Dauphine island, and effected a landing before dark. They immediately moved forward toward a clearing in the woods, ten miles distant. By dark a heavy rain set in. The gunboats shelled the woods, and, amidst the thick dark ness and thunder-storm, the march was slow. Three times the skirmish line got in rear of the main column. Finally, at"], [25, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 15 midnight, weary and drenched to the skin, the column halted and sank down on the sand to await morning. Then myriads of mosquitoes commenced their attack ; but the men, being literally exhausted by such a march, fell asleep. In the morn ing the march was resumed ; the confederate skirmishers were soon met, but made httle resistance, and at ten, a. m., the column came in sight, and within two miles of Fort Gaines. At the edge of the woods a line was formed, and reserve breast works constructed of fallen trees. On the 4th, the skirmishers were within half a mile of the fort, and intrenchments were commenced. The guns from Fort Gaines did some shelhng, and the skirmish fire on both sides was hvely, but the casual ties were hght. The morning of the 5th was clear and cloudless. The con federate guns opened briskly at sunrise. It was the morning Farragut had promised his gallant seamen and marines, \" they should breakfast in Mobile bay.\" : At six o'clock, the fleet of some fourteen splendid vessels, with slow and stately pace, steamed toward Fort Morgan. Farragut, as is well known, had taken post in the main rigging of the flagship, Hartford. The Tecumseh, being in the lead, fired the first shot. Ten minutes afterward, both forts opened on the fleet. About the same time the Tecumseh struck a tor pedo, and the gallant Craven and his devoted crew \u2014 about one hundred and twenty souls \u2014 found a watery grave. A moment ary shudder pierced the breast of every beholder. Ten were rescued by the bravery of Acting Ensign H. C. Nields and boat's crew from the Metacomet, within six hundred yards of the fort, under a galling fire. Every gun that could be brought to bear from the ships was constantly served. In the begin ning, Fort Morgan itself seemed a waU of fire, but in a few moments was obscured by smoke. As the Tecumseh sank, the flagship rushed forward and took the lead. The shock, the"], [26, "16 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. dread clamor, of that cannonading \u2014 its sharp concussion and loudly reverberating roar, defy description. Amid the tempest of battle, Farragut, from his elevated position, calmly surveyed the whole scene. One hour of intense excitement; \u2014 one hour of straining tod at the guns \u2014 and the fleet passed the fort and entered the bay. Then the confederate navy \u2014 the ram Ten nessee, the Morgan, Gaines, and Selma \u2014 opened fire. The Metacomet gave chase to the Selma, and in an hour captured her and her crew of ninety officers and men. The Morgan escaped up the bay ; the Gaines, disabled, sought shelter under the guns of Fort Morgan. The iron ram Tennessee, like a monstrous thing of life, stood up with threatening aspect for the Hartford. Seeing this, Farragut signalled the monitors, and wooden vessels best adapted, to attack her, not only with their guns, but bows on at stdl speed. For two hours the strug gle was desperate and fearful. The ironclads grappled fiercely with then huge antagonist, and the wooden vessels, with ro mantic valor, bore down on her invulnerable sides. Finally, the Manhattan, with a XV-inch shot, penetrated her armor, and a shot from a monitor in her steering apparatus rendered her helpless. The white flag appeared, and twenty officers and one hundred and seventy men were surrendered. Her loss was eight or ten killed and wounded, her admiral, Buchanan, being seriously wounded. The loss in the federal navy that morning was fifty-two killed and one hundred and seventy wounded. The fleet now washed up their bloody decks and rested. Meantime the siege of Fort Gaines continued. On the 6th, the land forces mounted two thirty-pounder Parrotts and four twelve-pounder rifles, and prepared works for more guns. About five, p. m., one of the monitors steamed up and dropped several shells into the fort. Apprehending what might follow, the commander of the garrison, Col. Anderson, inqnired of Ad-"], [27, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 17 miral Farragut on what terms he would receive the surrender of the fort. The 7th was occupied in arranging terms and making out rolls of men to be surrendered. At nine, A. M., of the 8th, Fort Gaines was unconditionally surrendered, and large quantities of ammunition and supphes were turned over in good condition. The confederate loss in killed and wounded had not exceeded ten, and the federal land forces lost only two killed. Among the latter was Corporal Grey, of the Thirty-fourth Iowa. The prisoners \u2014 nine hunched \u2014 were immediately embarked for New Orleans, and the besiegers regaled themselves with the best meal they had had since arriving on Dauphine island \u2014 corn-dodgers, fried bacon, and coffee. Siege of Fort Morgan. \u2014 On the 9th, at dayhght, Granger's command, now reinforced by the Twentieth Wisconsin, Thirty eighth Iowa, and Ninety-fourth Blinois, embarked for Navy cove, four mdes down the peninsula from Fort Morgan, on the bay side, with a view to besiege that fort. The commander of Fort Morgan then caused the gunboat Gaines to be burned, and also the hospital and other buildings outside of the fort. After landing, the troops moved forward, and that night lay on their arms two miles from the fort. On the 10th, they advanced, and the Thirty-fourth Iowa, being on the skirmish line, got within six hundred yards of the fort without drawing fire, the garrison keeping quiet and expecting an assault. Shght advances were made each night, and intrenchments dug in the sand, till the skirmishers were within two hundred yards of the fort. Occasionally a monitor would steam up, and throw one-hundred and two-hundred pound shells into the fort, but the replies from the latter seemed ineffective against their iron sides ; though, in the arma- 2"], [28, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 18 ment of the fort, were several Armstrong and Whitney guns, and one Whitworth. A siege-train having previously arrived, under Gen. Richard Arnold, by the 21st, the land forces had twenty-five cannon and sixteen mortars in position. The mortars were behind a heavy parapet four hundred yards from the fort, and manned by men of the Thirty-eighth Iowa. The guns were in redoubts, and manned by companies of the First Indiana heavy artillery and a detachment of sailors from the fleet, the naval battery being commanded by Lieut. Tyson, of the Hartford. The troops were subjected to severe tod in constructing works in the sand ; and were day and night exposed to a searching fire from the fort. The Bombardment.\u2014 At daylight on the, 22d, a gun from a monitor gave the signal for a general bombardment. At nine, a. M., the whole fleet was in hne of battle and the firing con tinued with unabated fury. From seven to nine, P. M., it was slow and irregular; but at half past nine, p. m., a fire was dis covered breaking out in the fort, and the firing was then in tensely renewed to prevent extinguishment. Six or eight mortar shells could be counted in the ah- at once ; and every shot ap peared to take effect. Nor in the midst of this destructive shower was the garrison moved by any weak fears. When the fire broke out they exposed themselves to extinguish it, and threw ninety thousand pounds of powder into the cisterns. Between forty and fifty had been killed or wounded. One man had been blown eighty feet into the ah' by the explosion of a shell. The interior of the fort had become a mass of smouldering ruins ; there was not a space five feet square which had not been defaced by shell. Many of the guns had been shattered into pieces by solid shot and shells. The garrison did not reply to the fleet during the bombard ment. They attempted, however, to use some of their guns on"], [29, "19 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. the land batteries but were prevented by sharpshooters. Their own sharpshooters were somewhat troublesome to the besiegers ; but the latter during the operations had only five men wounded. The firing continued at intervals all night, and at six, A. M., on the 23d, a white flag appeared on the parapet of the fort, and the garrison was formally surrendered at half past two, p. M. The Twentieth Wisconsin and Thirty-fourth Iowa were desig nated on the part of the land forces to receive the surrender. When the prisoners had been marched out and the confederate flag was taken down, the confederate general, Page, was affected to tears. But good humor and mirth prevailed among the men. The besiegers had used mules in hauling up theh guns. The confederate pickets, seeing this and giving the animals credit for longer ears than they really had, had been free in expressions of derision at such a battery. And now the besiegers were return ing the rafllery. Such is an epitome of the operations which contributed un common renown to the naval history of the republic. The land forces engaged were proud and joyous in having a small share in so much glory. The federal fleet now having control of Mobde bay put a stop to blockade-iTinning. It was given out and generally beheved that Mobde could be taken at pleasure. But it was hardly so, nor was any further movement made. The confederates hasten ed to strengthen their defences nearer the city, and budt the works known as Spanish fort on the eastern shore. The bay having been strewn with torpedoes Farragut com menced the process of removing them, and on the 13th of Sep tember reported that twenty-one had been taken up. A demonstration was made against Mobile the following December by a small column of infantry under Gen. Granger, moving from Pascagoula. It reached Grand bay twenty-two mdes from the city, and then returned. At the same time a"], [30, "20 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. column of cavahy under Gen. Davidson, from Baton Rouge, struck, but did not cross, the Pascagoula river ; and another column of cavalry under Gen. Grierson was moving southeaster ly from Memphis. If the condition of affairs in Mobde had been known to the federal commander at the time Fort Powell was evacuated, August 5th, he could then have cheaply captured the place. There were then no troops in nor immediately about the city \u2014 the artillery even having been caded away to oppose Gen. A. J. Smith's column then advancing from Memphis. And after the fight with him at Harrisburgh the same troops were ordered to West Point, Georgia, to support Gen. Hood, so that the federal forces, if moved through Grant's pass in light-draught steamers, thence up Dog river to Dog river factory, and there disem barked, couAd have marched into the city with scarcely any resistance \u2014 demonstrations being made at the same time by the fleet upon the batteries in front of the city.1 But it would, of course, have been necessary to reinforce Gen. Granger's small command to at least eight thousand men to enable him to hold the city successfully for a great length of time. In twenty days Gen. Maury had collected such a garrison of confederate troops as would have required the federals to resort to the slow process of a siege. i Gen. D. H. Maury's Report, Mobile Times, Mar. 11, 1866."], [31, "CHAPTER III. CONCENTRATION, ORGANIZATION, AND EQUIPMENT OF THE ARMY. A campaign and its plan being determined on, there needs to be on the part of the leader a foresight which includes every thing, and a care that never sleeps, to secure for the army the proper supply of material, the best equipment, the utmost effi ciency ; so that it can at any moment take advantage of its suc cess, or if it meet with reverses that it shall not be overcome. That operations should be undertaken against Mobde was decided early in January, 1865 ; but the plan was not arranged till some time afterward. The troops designated for the campaign had to be moved by water from posts above New Orleans to the vicinity of Mobde bay \u2014 some point on which would be the base ; and as the trans portation required sea and gulf vessels, whose number and capa city were less than river transports, this preliminary movement required considerable time. Canby's movable forces had lately been organized into bri gades of the \" Reserve Corps of the Mditary Division of the West Mississippi,\" comprising about ten thousand effectives. They had formed a part of the Thirteenth corps at Vicksburgh, and more recently had belonged to the Nineteenth corps. One brigade was at DevaU's Bluff, Arkansas, and the remainder were stationed along the Mississippi from Memphis down. Early in January they were concentrated at Kenner, ten mdes above New Orleans, and Major-Gen. F. Steele was assigned to then command, with instructions to have them fitted for a cam-"], [32, "22 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. paign. They were troops which had been wed tried on many occasions, and were in ad respects such as any commander would be proud of. Here they remained about three weeks. Then camp lay outside of the levee, stretched along for four mdes, and the ground was actually lower than the surface of the river. The weather was hke September along the St. Lawrence, but there was considerable rain, and the ground being much of the time wet and muddy the men could hardly be comfortable. Nevertheless, in pursuance of Gen. Steele's orders, some time was spent each day, when the weather admitted, in drill \u2014 prin cipaUy in the manual of arms. What the campaign was to be, whether against Mobde or into Texas, was not yet known even by Gen. Steele. But a portion of the troops being ordered to Barrancas, Florida, it appeared the former must be the objective point. About the 23d of January, Gen. Canby received information leading to a suspicion that an attempt would be made by the confederates to regain possession of Barrancas or some other point thereabouts on the gulf. On the afternoon of that day a despatch was received at Ken ner for the commander of the Third brigade of the reserve to report immediately in person at the headquarters of the mditary division, New Orleans ; and complying therewith before dark, he received written instructions to proceed with the detachment of his brigade then at Kenner to East Pascagoula, and was enjoined to use despatch. Transportation was not then entirely ready. Yet the next day the regiments had ad embarked with their equipage. The Twenty-fourth Indiana proceeded on the Corin thian round through the mouth of the river and the gulf. By dusk the Thirty-fourth Iowa, and One Hundred and Four- teenth Ohio, had landed at New Orleans; whence they pro ceeded by rail to Lake Pontchartrain in detachments\u2014 the cars being insufficient to take an entire regiment. Arriving there in"], [33, "23 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. the middle of a dark and windy night, they rapidly moved their stores and teams over the long wharf \u2014 which in many places was so rotten that some of the animals broke through \u2014 took their wagons to pieces and loaded them and the equipage on steam ers, making the fourth time theh luggage had been handled in twenty-four hours. At daylight, the 26th, they reported to Gen. Granger, at East Pascagoula, and were by him ordered to Bar rancas, in accordance with previous instructions from Gen. Canby. They arrived at Barrancas at daylight, the 27th, and debarked and went into camp. The remainder of the brigade arrived on the 1st of February ; and it was there in camp six weeks. It may interest the reader to know how troops spend such a period of time immediately preceding a campaign. But first let us take a view of their surroundings ; likewise of their camp. The natural appearance of that part of the country is unat tractive. Barrancas is a narrow and sandy peninsula, a third part covered with pine openings, with here and there clusters of live oaks. Along the shore the sand is white, and on a raw day creates the illusion of snow. The fort which gives the place its name was originally budt by the Spaniards, about two centuries ago, and with Fort Pickens, which is opposite, helps to guard the entrance into the splendid harbor of Pensacola. On the southeastern side of the peninsula are the ruins of the Pensacola navy-yard ; and surrounding that are the vdlages of Woolsey and Warrington. From the land ing at Barrancas the ground rises slightly for a mile, and then declines to a bayou on the north side. On the higher ground was located the camp of the brigade. Its front was along the edge of the pine wood, and near was a small clear stream. The Camp at Barrancas. \u2014 The brigade was camped in the following order from right to left, the regiments having taken position as they happened to arrive, rather than according to rank : The Twenty-fourth Indiana (veteran), consolidated with"], [34, "24 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. the Sixty-seventh, Col. W. T. Spicely ; the Thirty-fourth Iowa, consolidated with the Thirty-eighth, Col. G. W. Clark; tho One Hundred and Fourteenth Ohio, consolidated with the One Hundred and Twentieth, Col. J. H. Kelly; the Eighty-third Ohio, consolidated with the Forty-eighth (veteran), Col. F. W. Moore ; the Sixty-ninth Indiana, Lieut.-Col. O. Perry ; and the Ninety-seventh Illinois, Lieut.-Col. V. Vifquain. Some . time afterward, the Seventy-sixth Blinois, Col. S. F. Busey, arrived, and, being attached to the brigade, took position on the left. It is a saying among the volunteers, that the more pleasant their camp is made, the sooner will they be called upon to leave it. However much or httle this thought influenced these regiments, they certainly, in a very few days, made a beautiful and attractive camp. It was laid out with five streets to a regi ment, with tents for two companies on a street, the companies facing. Small evergreen trees were cut and haided to the camp, and set in rows on each side of every street, and in front of every tent. Handsome arbors were made, and artificial groves before the officers' tents ; and especially around the hos pital tents, which, however, were but few in number and had but few inmates. Walks were neatly arranged, having their margins adorned with shrubbery, handsome shells, and devices moulded from the white sand. Guns, mortars, shields, cannon balls, and other warlike implements were ingeniously carved in this sand, with, here and there, a felicitous motto or inscription. Its cleanliness corresponded with the taste and industry dis played in ornamenting it. These soldiers were some of the best young men of the West, and had the characteristics of proud and gallant men, as one could plainly see who noticed them off duty in their familiar and joyous groups around the camp. The plates on their accoutre ments were kept brightly polished, and their muskets and accoutrements always neat. Two hours in the forenoon they"], [35, "CAMTAIGN OF MOBILE. 25 spent in company drill, devoting considerable attention to the manual of arms and to target practice ; and two hours of the afternoon were devoted to brigade drfll. The ground on which these drills took place was a mile north of Fort Barrancas. The field officers met evenings in the school of the brigade ; and the exercises of the brigade in the field were eminently successful. As these battalions moved with so much precision and beauty, closed in mass, or rapidly deployed, or advanced in line of battle in double-quick on the charge, then bayonets glittering and their alignment grandly preserved, no observer could doubt \u2014 remembering they had been through many battles \u2014 that these were rehersals for no common event. As transportation coidd be furnished, the greater portion of the other brigades of the Reserve corps moved from Kenner to Fort Gaines. On the 18th of February, the Reserve corps, with the addition of seven regiments, namely, the Twenty-ninth and Thirty-third Iowa, Fiftieth Indiana, Twenty-seventh, Twen ty-eighth, and Thirty-fifth Wisconsin, and Seventy-seventh Ohio, which had been sent down from the department of Arkansas ; and several hght batteries, were organized as the Thirteenth corps, comprising three divisions, and Major-Gen. Gordon Granger assigned to its command. The Sixteenth army corps, commanded by Major-Gen. A. J. Smith, having taken a prominent part hi the two days' battle of Nashville, and in the pursuit of Hood's army, was, early in February, at Eastport, Mississippi. The roads rendering it impracticable for a further movement south with heavy trains, orders were sent by Grant to have this corps move round and report to Canby. Accordingly, on the 5th and 6th of February, a fleet of forty-three river steamboats and seven tow-boats with barges, appeared at Eastport, and taking aboard the Sixteenth corps and five thousand of Wdson's cavahy, with horses, on the 7th, moved down the Tennessee to the Ohio, thence into"], [36, "26 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. the Mississippi. In eight days it arrived at Vicksburgh, where, in pursuance of orders, the cavalry disembarked. But an un fortunate blunder in transmitting a telegraphic despatch, caused the Sixteenth corps also to land and go into camp. But Gen. Smith, having orders in his pocket for his corps to move to New Orleans, hastened down the river to the nearest telegraphic station, and, communicating with Gen. Canby, had the matter corrected, and returned to Vicksburgh for his corps. Four days were thus lost. Re-embarking, the Sixteenth corps reached the suburbs of New Orleans on the 21st, having moved thirteen hundred and thirty-five mdes in eleven days of actual travel. It then remained some days on the low, wet ground, a few of the regiments occupying Jackson's battle-field. By the 7th of March it had arrived at Fort Gaines. About the same time, Hawkins' colored division, five thou sand five hundred strong, arrived at Barrancas. Ten days later, Lucas' brigade of cavalry arrived at the same place, and the column forming there had been placed under the command of Gen. Steele. The siege-train was being organized at Fort Gaines, and consisted of the seven batteries of the First Indiana, and \"A\" and \"K\" of the Sixth Michigan (heavy) artidery, and Mack's Eighteenth New York. The main army was now encamped on Dauphine island, in the vicinity of Fort Gaines, under shelter-tents. Inspections were frequent, to the end that deficiencies in clothing and equipments might be supplied and all surplus articles be dispensed with. The troops received new cloth ing, to make their supply complete. Canby's orders to perfect the organization, equipment, and mobility of the army, were most thorough, and may be studied"], [37, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 27 with profit by those, who shad hereafter undertake campaigns ; by aU, indeed, who follow the profession of arms.1 i HEADQUARTERS, GENERAL ORDERS, j Military Division of West Mississippi, No. 15. ) New Orleans, La., February 5th, 1865. 1.

THE PLAN OF OPERATIONS The fortifications around Mobde were so strong that a direct movement on the place, from the western shore, would have encountered unequal resistance, and involved a protracted siege. It was therefore determined to flank them. The base would be fixed on the eastern shore ; and the main army moving up on that shore, with the aid of the navy, would carry the forts on the islands and main land, and then approach Mobile by the Tensas river or one of the channels coming in above. On this plan a large portion of the troops and the supphes could be moved by water into Fish river, affording a secure base within twenty miles of Spanish fort. In the meantime, to destroy communication by radroad between Mobde and Montgomery, and to prevent reinforce ments coming from the latter point to Mobde, or the garrison from escaping, a column of twelve thousand was to move out from Pensacola north. By moving as far as Pollard it would also create the behef that it was aiming at Montgomery, and tend to distract and deceive the confederates. In case the main army should reduce the eastern shore defences sooner than was expected, then the column from Pensacola could be ordered on to Montgomery\u2014 though this was not contemplated ; but if the operations were protracted, it would move round and form a junction with the main army. So, if the reduction of those works demanded a very long time, then the forces would pass them, move on to Mont-"], [42, "32 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. gomery \u2014 which was really the objective point \u2014 leaving Mobde to fall in due time by these inclirect operations. It is to be borne in mind that the difficulty in bringing up supplies by land, tended to retard a column moving far into the interior more than any armed resistance that could be expected. Whde these operations should be progressing a large column of cavalry was to move down from North Alabama to divert the attention of Forrest and the bulk of the confederate cavalry, then hoveriLg about Central Alabama and Mississippi. Some smaller cavahy expeditions were projected, the achieve ments of which wdl be noticed."], [43, "CHAPTER V. THIRTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CORPS MOVE TO DANLEY'S, ON FISH RIVER. The movement was commenced by the Thirteenth corps, March 17th. Benson's division, numbering six thousand, pre ceded by Bertram's brigade of the Second division \u2014 which during the campaign continued detached from its division \u2014 marched at half-past five from Fort Morgan, along the penin sula nine mdes, and went into camp in an open pine forest. On the 18th, they marched thirteen miles on a good road over a natural shed bank, and camped at three, p. M., on Bayou portage. On the 19th, the unreliable and swampy character of the ground disclosed itself, the firm appearing surface prov ing, when wet, to be a mere crust, under which was a bottom less quicksand. Through this crust the wagons sank to the hubs. The head of the column passing round Bon Secour's bay, moved only a few miles, and the rear-guard got only a mile and a half. Large details were set at work corduroying the worst places. On the 20th, starting at nine, A. m., they moved slowly, the rain fading in torrents, and the corduroy afloat, and made four mdes by night. Veatch's division hav ing crossed from Fort Gaines to Navy cove, the 17th, had now closed up on the Third division, and halted two days to let the latter division get in advance, but was obliged, meantime, to keep heavy details at work on the roads. At six, the morning of the 21st, the rain still pouring, Ben ton's division moved on ; but the train could not even get out 3"], [44, "34 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. of park. Every team seeking an untried path soon got mired, and wagons were seen in ad directions sunk down to the hubs. The poor animals, in theh struggles to haul the teams, half buried themselves. In this ddemma, long ropes were made fast to the teams, and the soldiers, with cheerfulness and alacrity, hauled both animals and wagons out of the mire with a rush ; and it was only their speed that saved each team from again sinking at every rod. The same laborious efforts were applied to the field artidery. The corps and division commanders were present,, wading about in the mud to then knees, and the latter himself lending a hand at the ropes. In hauling the Twenty sixth New York battery through a bad place, where the newly made corduroy had been washed away, the men moved some distance in mud and water waist deep. These labors were being watched by confederate scouts. Only about two mdes were made that day. The division went into camp at three, p. M., and made some fortifications on their right. The bay was only three mdes distant on the left. Yet only two mdes off in that direction two hundred and fifty confederate cavalry camped the same night ; and before dark, hoping to capture a few foragers or stragglers, had driven up some cattle in sight of the camp of the Thirteenth corps ; yet without avad, as the orders about foraging were wed enforced. Bertram's brigade having pushed on with great energy, and done its share of bridge-building and corduroying, yet enjoying the privdege of the advance all the way. reached Fish river the same afternoon (21st) with Foust's battery and the wagons. The scouts attached to the brigade \u2014 thirty men of the Fourth Wisconsin cavahy, under Lieut. Knowles, had a smad skirmish during the day. The same afternoon, Capt. J. J. Smith's com pany of pontoniers had, in three hours, taken the boats from raft and laid a bridge, three hundred and twenty feet in length, over Fish river. Bertram's brigade crossed over on this the"], [45, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 35 next morning, and went into camp near the Sixteenth corps, and intrenched and feUed trees in their front. The 22d opened fair. Late in the day this part of the column marched on through a pine forest, and in the evening, having gone five miles, went into camp on high ground ; the rear of the division came up by the hght of the burning pitch trees. The 23d, Benton moved on over a fair road, though hidy, six mdes, to the north fork of Fish river, crossed it on a pontoon, and went into camp on the right of the Sixteenth corps, the bands playing, \" Oh, ain't you glad you're out of the wdderness.\" So wretched had been the road the train was not ad up for three or four days ; but Col. Mackay, of the Thirty-third Iowa, suc ceeded in getting a section of twenty wagons in that night. Veatch's division, having resumed the march on the 22d, en countered simdar difficulties and performed simdar tods to those that retarded the advance. The afternoon of the 24th, when within a few mdes of Dan ley's, the column, not being wed closed up, was boldly attacked by a smad party of confederate scouts, and some men and ani mals captured, in the following manner : Attack on the Train. \u2014 On the morning of the 24th, Lieut. Sib ley, of the Fifteenth confederate cavahy, acting as scout for Gen. Lidell, left Greenwood with eight men, and passing round Polecat creek, came in sight of the First division, two mdes above Magnolia, by the middle of the afternoon. The smad party halted and watched for stragglers. Soon they saw five men by themselves, who appeared to be resting ; and cautiously moving toward them tid within a few yards, then spurring their horses into a keen gadop, and raising a yed, they charged and captured them. The men were surprised and made no resistance. They belonged to the Fhst brigade, the commander of which was sitting not far off.

Sibley, with the balance of his men, in half an hour charged on the train, a few hundred yards below, and captured a few wagoners and ten mules, and was prevented from further mischief by the Ninety-ninth Blinois coming up. He then returned with all his prisoners to Greenwood, and from there despatched to Gen. Lided, at Blakely, that he learned from the prisoners that Gen. A. J. Smith had a command on the Western shore to operate against Mobile \u2014 an error which, whether fabricated or not by the prisoners, helped to compensate for their capture. This gadant feat of Lieut. Sibley created some excitement in the column. Men were hurried up from the rear, and some came back from the front to the scene of the affair. The division crossed Fish river the same evening, and went into camp with the rest of the corps. Demonstration on the Western Shore. \u2014 While the main army was moving up the east shore, a demonstration was also made on the west shore, to create the impression that the principal movement was there to be made. At noon, on the 18th, Col. J. B. Moore, with his brigade \u2014 First of Third division, Six teenth corps \u2014 consisting of the Thirty-third Wisconsin, Ninety fifth and Seventy-second Blinois, and Forty-fourth Missouri \u2014 seventeen hundred effective \u2014 and two Rodman guns of the First Indiana light battery, embarked for Cedar point. Arriv ing there, the pier was found nearly destroyed, and the men landed by passing in single file over a slight trestle-work. The confederates occupied the point in small force, which was driven back two mdes, without any trouble, by the Seventy-second Blinois, Lieut.-Col. Stockton commanding. The artillery was landed by means of a temporary raft made with boats; and commencing repairs on the pier at daylight the next morning, the horses were got on shore by tei_, and at two, p. m., Moore moved forward, and at Alabama point, two miles up the bay,"], [47, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 37 met the confederate outposts, consisting of two mounted com panies, which fed back with shght resistance, the Ninety-fifth lllhiois, Col. Blanding, being in the advance and pursuing them. At five, p. m., Moore went into camp, and that night and the next morning had the cads repeated three or four times, to impress the enemy with the magnitude of his forces. At eight o'clock the next morning (20th), he advanced to Fowle river, where he met some resistance, the confederates having set the bridge on fire and taken position on the opposite side ; but he brought up his two guns and threw over some skirmishers without difficulty. Here he halted, not having orders to go further, and was gratified to learn that his force had been re ported in Mobile, at from four thousand to six thousand. In this vicinity, and at different points on the road, some torpedoes were found, which were narrowly escaped ; and what was more singular, respectable American inhabitants were found who had never seen the United States flag, and desired Colonel Moore to show it to them, which he did. On the 22d, he received orders to embark for Fish river, and on the 23d, rejoined his division. Movement of the Sixteenth Corps. \u2014 The Sixteenth corps moved on transports from Fort Gaines to Danley's ferry landing, on north bank of Fish river ; and the boats having to make two trips, the movement occupied the 20th, 21st, and 22d. Carr was ordered, with the boats carrying his division, to stand boldly up the bay, as if intending to land on the main shore, and then fad back and enter Fish river, which was done. Fish river is a dark, narrow, and crooked stream, and such boats as the Tarrascon and Starlight seemed to fill it to its banks. The latter ,~ soine distance from its mouth, swed into moderate bluffs, which were covered with a generous growth of cypress, magnolia, and pine, and fringed with a variety of flowers and shrubs. Occasionally a house was passed, the poor"], [48, "38 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. inmates of which, having but a feeble conception of the troops, habituady hung out a white flag. A bald eagle, from the crest of a lofty pine, screamed out a welcome to the youthful vete rans who thickly covered the decks ; and they, remembering from theh school-books how the ancient heroes received such an omen, accepted this as a favorable augury, and shouted out their usual cheers."], [49, "CHAPTER VI. THREE DAYS AT FISH RIVER. The Sixteenth corps remained in camp at Fish river for the Thirteenth corps to come up by land, and for supplies, trans portation, and some of the heavy guns, to come up by water. Fish river, at Danley's ferry, is eighty yards wide and the cur rent sluggish. The north bank is moderately high, the sod sandy, and covered with an open pine forest. Near by were the ruins of a mill, and four or five humble dwellings. Gen. Carr continued the brigade drills in his division which he had commenced at Fort Gaines, soon after assuming its com mand, and constantly improved its discipline and efficiency. And, in subsequent marches, no division of the corps was so poorly supplied as that with. chickens and pigs; nor did any division have higher reputation for gadantry.

Such of the soldiers as were disposed assembled in religious meetings when circumstances permitted. One pleasant even ning, in Gdbert's brigade (Garrard's division, Sixteenth corps), a thousand men were assembled, and the woods being ht up by fires of pine-knots, the soldiers poured forth theh fervent prayers and joined their voices in sacred hymns. Nor wdl those who remember such heroes as Havelock deny that piety is a help to valor. On the 25th, Canby moved forward with both corps and some of the heavy artidery ; the men carrying four days' rations in haversacks. The Thirtieth Missouri was left to guard the pontoon bridge. The Sixteenth corps marched at eight, a. m. Hubbard' s brigade of McArthur'3 division being in the advance. The Thirteenth coqis was under way by one, p. m. McArthur's division had got but a short distance when a smad force of the confederates was met, which was steadily pressed back by four companies of the Ninth Min nesota deployed as skirmishers. There was more or less skirmishing during the day, but the column was not retarded. Col. Marshad, commanding Third brigade, Fhst division, Six teenth corps, was wounded in the back of his neck by the bad of a sharpshooter, but stopped only long enough to have the wound dressed. The Sixteenth corps camped at Deer Park, having marched twelve mdes. The Thirteenth corps encamped in the same neighborhood. And the troops in trenched in comphance with the general order. Bertram's brigade of Second division, Thirteenth corps, had had moved on the left road to Montrose. At this place, which is a pleasant summer resort, the inhabitants were ad con federates, and some of theh cavalry had been there during"], [52, "42 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. the day. One of the ladies in a defiant manner told a regi mental commander he would find his match on the morrow \u2014 that Sherman had lately been defeated with great loss, and that victory had now turned in their favor ; a fair specimen of stories which were ever being reported and did much to keep up the spirits of the confederates. The next day, 26th, Bertram's brigade moved to D'Olieve's creek over a hidy road, the confederate cavalry hanging along theh front ad the way. The bridge over the creek had been destroyed, and both banks at the ford were thickly planted with torpedoes, and in attempting to cross, the explosions fatady wounded three men and kided four horses ; fifty torpe does were there taken up the next day. Being now in the vicinity of Spanish fort, the brigade camped on the creek ; Benson's division of the Thirteenth corps being in sight on the right. There were indications of the presence of confed erate infantry, a few of whom were captured by Bertram's brigade. During the day its scouts had captured a confed erate telegraph station with the latest despatches. Granger, with Veatch's and Benson's divisions \u2014 the former in the advance \u2014 after getting two mdes from Deer Park, turned to the left on a road running northwesterly, and struck D'Olieve's creek about noon a mile to the right of Bertram. The banks were here high and somewhat steep, but the stream was not wide, and a bridge was soon made, over which the column passed. Ascending the hid on the north bank, the column soon moved down its opposite side, where was another stream, which was bridged and crossed ; and after rising the high ground beyond, both divisions went into camp, Veatch's in front and in line of battle. The train and rear-guard were not all in till nine in the evening. The Twenty-first Iowa, Lieut.-Col. Van Anda commanding, had been in the advance ad day; and the skirmishers from"], [53, "43 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. that regiment, under Maj. Boardman, with those from the Ninety-ninth Blinois, Col. A. C. Matthews, had been warmly engaged at different times. Granger rode along the hne at dusk, and thinking the pickets not far enough out, ordered an advance. The skirmishers with theh reserves then moved for ward half a mde up a gradual rise in the pine timber ; and the leaves and underbrush having been fired by the confed erates, the hght gave the latter a full view of what was com ing ; whereupon they rose up, gave a heavy volley of musketry, but soon fed back. The fire was promptly returned, and Gran ger, being in the advance, narrowly escaped ; for it was dark, and he was a few moments between the fire of his own reserves and that of the confederates. La the Twenty-first Iowa, Private Allen was kdled, and three men were wounded. In the Ninety-ninth Blinois, Private Robinson was kided. At midnight both regiments were relieved by the Forty-seventh Indiana, and One Hundred and Sixty-first New York. Leaving Spanish fort three miles on its left, the Sixteenth corps marched on a direct route to C. Sibley's mid. Garrard's division had the advance, and at the head of the column, the Tenth Kansas, Lieut.-Col. Hdls, and four companies of the Sixth Minnesota, under Major H. S. Bailey, were deployed as skirmishers. Sharp firing commenced as soon as the head of the column had moved a mde, and continued all the way. there being a detention of two hours. But no serious resistance was met till the bridge at Sibley's mdl was reached, which was finady crossed, and the corps went into camp on high ground, a mde north of Bayou Minette, on which Sibley's mdl is situated, the distance marched being ten mdes. Of the con federates who were killed, three were buried near the bridge. and there were some wounded. The Sixth Minnesota lost twc men captured, and the Tenth Kansas two wounded. The sec ond Tennessee (federal) cavalry had two men wounded."], [54, "44 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Plans and Position of the Confederates. \u2014 At this time the confederate department commander was Lieut.-Gen. Richard Taylor, headquarters at Meredian, Mississippi ; Maj.-Gen. D. H. Maury was in command of the district of the gulf, with headquarters at Mobde. The garrison of Mobile, including troops on eastern shore, numbered about nine thousand.1 There were, on the 27th of March, also upward of a thousand blacks subject to the orders of the engineer. Lieut.-Gen. Taylor telegraphed Lee that he was ready to receive any attack that might be made there.2 Maury's command also embraced the garrisons on the eastern shore, where the senior officer was Brig.-Gen. Lidell. The latter's headquarters had been at a cottage on the Blakely road, about a mde outside of the fortifications at Blakely, his troops being camped on the high ground in an open pine forest a httle further to the front. These forces comprised French's division, then commanded by Brig.-Gen. Cockred, including the brigades of Col. Gates and Col. Barry ; the brigades of Brig.-Gens. J. T. Holtzclaw and R. L. Gibson ; Ector's Texas brigade, then com manded by Col. Andrews, and Gen. Thomas' Alabama re serves \u2014 the whole effective infantry numbering about six thou sand. There were also three hundred cavalry, and inside the works several batteries. All of these troops, except the reserves, and perhaps the cavahy, were veterans from Hood's army. 1 IJeut.-Gen.

Holtzclaw's brigade was stid farther to the front, on outpost duty at O. Sibley's mill (four mdes north of C. Sibley's), where were some breastworks and a few light guns. In the road were a number of torpedoes. On the 23d, whde Col. Spence with cavahy was scouting toward Fish river, an infantry support under Col. Bush Jones of Alabama, was at Hollywood. On the 24th, Gen. Gibson with a column of infantry and artillery had moved down to the \"vidage,\" eight mdes below Spanish fort, and there halted. The same evening, Bertram's brigade having pushed forward resolutely to Montrose, three miles from the vidage, and Canby's other columns being on the move, Gibson faced about and took position on the hid north of D'Olieve's creek, and there remained on the 25th. Gen. Cockred with his division was now (the 25th) posted four miles northeast of Gibson at Alexis spring, being three mdes south of C. Sib ley's mill. Capt. Tutt was ordered to withdraw from Green wood to Sibley's mill and scout on the road to Durant's. Col. Spence was skirmishing in front of Bertram's brigade which he took for a division,1 and was instructed by Lidell, if pressed across D'Olieve's creek, to return by Alexis spring and the Sibley road. That forenoon Lided was at Spanish fort ; and thinking that Granger's corps only was approaching, and judging from the bad roads that the divisions would be sepa rated, had concluded to offer battle the next morning on the north bank of D'Oheve's creek, where the ground is high and hidy; and this was approved by the generals under him. Gibson with two brigades was to form on the right, Cock red with three brigades on the left, and Holtzclaw being 1 Gen. Lidell to Col.

And they estimated that their effective force of in fantry would be about six thousand. Gibson already occupied the proposed hne, having, the after noon of the 25th, three thousand in line of battle. That evening, Lided learned that the Sixteenth corps was also advancing with the Thirteenth, and so fast that he feared he would not be able to get the rest of his forces concentrated in season. He appeared to have been active day and night ehciting information and making the best possible use of his troops.1 The next morning, finding his position was being flanked by the Sixteenth corps, the proposed offer of battle 1 Capl.

Cockred withdrew over the Bay Minette bridge, burned it, and passing round near Blakely, moved out on the Sibley road to watch the Sixteenth corps. Gibson was ordered to fall back into Spanish fort ; but to develop the attacking army before doing so ; which we shad see was in a gadant manner done."], [58, "CHAPTER VII. SPANISH FORT\u2014 ITS INVESTMENT. The line of field fortifications known as Spanish fort is on the bay shore, seven mdes due east of Mobile. The traveder leav ing the Montgomery railroad, and proceeding by steamer from Tensas to Mobile, in a few minutes comes in sight of Blakely. Passing on, he will, in half an hour, discern off to his left, and beyond some low, marshy islands, a clearing, on the wooded shore, and a high, red bluff. This latter is the site of Spanish fort. Old Spanish fort is a bastioned work, nearly enclosed, and built on a bluff whose shape projects abruptly to the water. Its parapet, on the bay side, was partly natural, being made by excavating the earth from the side of the bluff, and was thirty feet in thickness. The fort was armed with VU-inch colum biads and thirty-pounder Parrotts \u2014 the latter made at Selma \u2014 and was designated as No. 1. Extending around that, in a semicircle, was a continuous line of breastworks and re doubts. The right of this line commenced four hundred yards down the shore, on the highest and most prominent bluff, up ward of one hundred feet above the water, with a strong, enclosed fort, called McDermett (No. 2), and armed with ten heavy guns. The slope of the bluff, toward the bay, is precipi tous, and from its base to the water is a marsh two hundred yards wide, on which the timber had been feded. To the north and left the descent was gradual, along which extended a line of rifle-pits, crossing a ravine and stream of water, and then up the"], [59, ""], [60, ""], [61, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 49 slope of another bluff, on which was a strong battery, designated as No. 3. From there the hne of works continued six hundred yards in a northerly direction, and then turned toward the bay, striking the marsh on Bay Minette at a point about a mile above old Spanish fort. This outer line of works was upward of two miles in length, and the batteries were all on high and com manding ground. The surface was covered with open pine timber, but in front of the outer line of works the trees were felled for a few hundred yards. Every ravine had borne a heavy growth of hard wood, which, having been slashed, made, with the underbrush and vines, an almost impassable obstruc tion. The ditch in front of the breastworks was five feet deep and eight feet wide, but in front of Fort McDermett it was deeper and wider. In front of the batteries were, also, detached rifle-pits, for sharpshooters ; and along the enthe front was a hne of abatis fifteen feet wide. On the extreme left the works were unfinished. Toward the interior the surface continued undulating and wooded ; but no spot was so commanding as the bare crest of McDermett. The reader wdl bear in mind that these fortifications were made to cover and protect the island batteries Huger and Tracy, which were three thousand yards distant. Attach on the Federal Pickets. \u2014 At daylight, on the morning of the 27th, a detachment of four hundred confederate infantry, under command of Col. Richard Lindsay, carefudy moved down within musket-range of Veatch's picket, fired a vodey, and, with a yell, charged between the flanks of the Forty-seventh Indiana and One Hundred and Sixty-first New York. The right of the latter regiment was driven back in some confu sion towards the main line, but shortly regained its position. The confederates got near enough to see the strong front of Veatch's division, which was quickly in hne behind their newly- 4"], [62, "50 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. made breastworks, but were soon compeded to retire. The firing was brisk for a few minutes, and the confederates lost one officer and several men wounded.1 The loss of the Forty seventh Indiana was three men wounded. Investment of Spanish Fort.\u2014 Gen. Carr learned, late on the evening of the 26th, that the Sixteenth corps would turn back in the morning against Spanish fort ; and knowing it would be his turn in the advance, he gave the requisite instructions to his brigade commanders. The morning of the 27th came with a prospect of heavy rain, which to veteran soldiers was some sign of a battle. The men had taken then accustomed breakfast, of hard-bread, coffee, and a slice of bacon, toasted on a stick \u2014 as Achides cooked the fat chine at the feast for the heroes. The usual hum of talk and speculation was heard around the expiring fires of then bivouac. By the men in the ranks ad plans of strategy are freely canvassed ; and up to this morning they had expected to move on to the Alabama ilver. Soon was heard the spirited rod on the drum to \" fad in,\" greeted by that habitual and never-to-be-forgotten shout or cheer of the men. Then the cartridge-box, with its \" forty rounds\" is buckled on ; the blanket is twisted up and thrown around the shoulders ; the intrenching tools are picked up ; the muskets taken ; each company is formed, the roll caded, and at the time fixed, whether in ten or fifteen minutes, the regiments are in hne. Leaving Garrard's division at Sibley's mill, Smith put the First and Third divisions of his corps in motion. Carr's (Third) division had the advance, with Geddes' (Third) brigade in ad- 1 Gibson to Lidell : \" Spanish Fort, March 27, 7:35 a. h.\u2014 Drove in the enemy's skirmishers at daylight, capturing guns, knapsacks, and blankets.

A. W. Rogers, were deployed as skir mishers, with the other five companies, under Capt. S. L. Camp bed, in reserve. In these woods were numerous trads which had been made in hauling lumber to the neighboring mills, and the guns being sdent at Spanish fort, the column had to find its way as best it could. Skirmish at Minette Bridge. \u2014 Carr had gone four mdes, and his advance, the Eighty-first Idinois, had just passed the brow of the hill overlooking Minette bayou, where the day before the bridge had been burned, when suddenly a volley came from a confederate regiment, concealed in the bushes, four hundred yards distant, on the opposite side. This was the Twenty-first Alabama, Lieut.-Col. James M. Williams, having two hundred and twenty-five men. Gen. Smith narrowly escaped, and some shots took effect in the Eighty-first. Col. Rogers returned the fire smartly, and was ordered by General Smith to remain there with his regiment and hold that position. The One Hundred and Twenty-fourth Blinois, Col. John H. Howe commanding, then took the advance, with five of his companies deployed as skirmishers. When within about a mile of Spanish fort, Gen. Smith caused both divisions to deploy in line of battle, and it was his purpose, of course, to have his movements concealed from the enemy. Carr's division, on the right, had formed in two lines ; the first consisting of the Third (Geddes') brigade, the One Hun dred and Eighth Blinois on the right, the Eighth Iowa on the left, the One Hundred and Twenty-fourth Blinois deployed as skirmishers in front. The second line, consisting of the First (Moore's) and the Second (Ward's) brigades ; Moore's having the Thirty-third Wisconsin on the right, the Seventy-second"], [64, "52 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Blinois in the centre, the Ninety-fifth Illinois on the left, and the Forty-fourth Missouri in reserve; and Ward's, having the Fourteenth Wisconsin on the right, the Forty-ninth Missouri in the centre, the Fortieth Missouri on the left. The latter brigade had wheeled into line on the double-quick, and had, been a few minutes in position, when the corps commander rode along with a stern countenance. At sight of their \"chief,\" the men of the Forty-ninth Missouri gave a cheer which could be heard in the confederate lines. Thus foded in his efforts to conceal the position, he rebuked the men in a few hasty words. In half a minute a shell from the confederate works came screeching through the trees, and dropped close to the men who had cheered. It did not burst as it fed, and the men gave back a httle. Seeing this, Smith cried out to them : \" Stand up to it ! You had no business cheering.\" Carr's centre and the hght batteries approached by the Blakely road. Sharp skirmishing commenced about ten, a. m., when within a mde of Spanish fort. The confederate sharp shooters were in advance of their rifle-pits, using the hdls and trees for cover. At this hour, McArthur's division was in line on the left of Carr ; and connecting with the left of the Sixteenth corps, Granger had come up with the Thirteenth corps ; so that the investment was nearly complete. The troops advanced with alacrity, theh banners ad unfurled. Their line was three mdes in length, and presented a splendid appearance moving through the open woods. Sharp skirmishing was constant along the whole front. The confederates, apprehending an assault, also kept up a vehement sheding with their heavy and light guns. And there was ad the clamor and stir of battle. The confederates had the advantage of being on the defensive, and being concealed, while the federals had the disadvantage of exposure, in pressing forward against the fire of sharpshooters,"], [65, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 53 and over the obstacles on the ground ; but, at the same time, they had the moral advantage there is in the prestige and mo mentum of constantly gaining ground. Up to noon no federal artdlery had opened, but the light bat teries of each division were near by in the hodows. A httle after noon, Carr caused the Fourteenth Indiana light battery, Capt. F. W. Morse, to open from a ridge about eight hundred yards from Red fort, and near the position afterward occu pied by the naval battery. Capt. Morse's fire was replied to with spirit during the afternoon, and many shots fed close, but no injury was sustained. Soon afterward, the Fhst Indiana light battery, Capt. L. Jacoby, opened from a prominent posi tion, a httle to the left and front of the Fourteenth. Both bat teries were supported by Moore's brigade. It was now toward the middle of the afternoon. The rain was coming down in a steady pour, and the fierceness of the artidery fire had abated. Carr, expecting to be ordered to assault, and feeling confident the works could be carried in his front, exerted himself to keep his lines compact. The One Hundred and Twenty-fourth Illinois had pressed on fearlessly, gaining distance of hah a mile in advance of its bri gade, when the confederate skirmishers were met and, after a warm contest, driven precipitously into their works. Five of that regiment fed, including its adjutant, Lieut. W. E. Smith, and the color-sergeant. On the extreme right was the One Hundred and Eighth Blinois, Col. Charles Turner, which sus tained a loss of six. Its skirmishers were commanded by Capt. W. M. Bullock, a daring and efficient officer, who fed, with his thigh badly shattered by a musket-bad ; but he refused to adow any of the men to expose themselves in helping him away, and dragged himself to the rear. The Eighth Iowa, distinguished for discipline and gallantry, Lieut.-Col. Bed commanding, was"], [66, "54 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. next on the left, and had thirteen men wounded by musketry, and of this number six were non-commissioned officers. Next on the left, in Moore's brigade, was the Thirty-third Wisconsin, which sustained a loss of six wounded, including Maj. -George R. Frank. The loss in the Seventy-second Bli nois was two, and in the Ninety-fifth Illinois four. In Ward's brigade there was a loss of one man in each regiment. So that the whole casualties in Carr's division were thirty-nine. The confederates in his front had been driven into their main works, and his line was established six hundred yards on an average therefrom. The ensuing night the division busdy intrenched. The advance along the left had conformed to the right and with nearly simdar results. McArthur's Division, Sixteenth Corps. \u2014 McArthur's division came squarely up opposite the Red fort, and began to encounter a stubborn resistance from the confederates at ten in the morn ing, nearly a mile from that work. The ground was wed con tested ; but before noon the confederates had been pressed back behind theh main works; the main hne of the division had got within about twelve hundred yards of those works ; a halt was ordered and the men made to he down. Meantime, the skirmish ers of the division had pushed their way some hundreds of yards farther. In the First (McMiden's) brigade on the right the casu alties were one in the Thirty-third Illinois, three in the Tenth Minnesota, two in the Twenty-sixth Indiana, and one in the Sev enty-second Ohio. The Second (Hubbard' s) brigade was in the centre, and suffered the most. The Eighth Wisconsin (Lieut.- Col. W. B. Britton), on the right had three killed and twenty seven wounded. In the Eleventh Missouri (Col. E. Bowyer), the casualties were twelve ; Ninth Minnesota (Col. J. H. Marsh), two; Fifth Minnesota (Lieut.-Col. W. B. Gere), six; Forty seventh Illinois (Lieut.-Col. Bonham), two, including Capt. Ryan. The Third (Marshad's) brigade was on the left, the"], [67, "55 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Thirty-third Missouri (Col. W. H. Heath) being on the right. Next was the Thirty-fifth Iowa (Lieut.-Col. W. B. Keeler), which lost two; then the Twelfth Iowa (Maj. Samuel G. Knee), which lost five wounded, and on the extreme left was the Seventh Min nesota (Lieut.-Col. Geo. Bradley). In this regiment Lieut. Fol som was slightly wounded by a piece of shed from one of the guns of the division, and Private McFadden was kided whde lying on the ground skirmishing. The right of the Thirteenth corps over-lapped three regiments of Marshall's brigade, and at dusk they were ployed in column of regiments in the rear, leav ing him only the front of one regiment. His skirmishers had eagerly pushed theh way into- the fallen trees and brush in the advance, and Corporal Fry of the Twelfth Iowa had got so far that he was taken for a confederate and received a severe wound in the foot, from some one in the rear. The Second Iowa battery (Capt. J. R. Reed), with four twelve pounder Napoleons opened fire on Red fort, one thousand yards distant ; and the Third Indiana battery of Rodman guns (Capt. T. J. Ginn), from a prominent point on the left. In the Thirteenth corps, Veatch's division having bivouacked in the front, had been working most of the night intrench ing, had been in line of battle at three in the morning, and the men were not feeling very fresh when they moved out at seven. But they were ready for a fight, and the behef prevaded that they were going to take Spanish fort by assault. Veatch dejdoyed when he had proceeded a mde with Slack's brigade on the right, the Third brigade, Lieut.-Col. Kinsey commanding, on the left, and Dennis' in reserve. Benson's division, moving at nine, came up on the right in three columns of regiments deployed, connecting with the Sixteenth corps. Bertram's brigade of Second division was sent round to the right of the Thirteenth corps, but was soon afterward"], [68, "56 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. ordered back, and taking the road round by Wadsworth's returned to its former position, and then closed up on the left. In the Third brigade (Benson's division), commanded by Col. Conrad Krez of the Twenty-seventh Wisconsin, the Seventy seventh Ohio had been detaded to guard the train and had moved to the rear, so that the brigade front consisted of the Twenty-seventh Wisconsin and the Thirty-third Iowa, with the Twenty-eighth Wisconsin in reserve. These regiments were at first employed to support the Twenty-sixth New York battery, and afterward formed on the right of the corps; but met with no loss during the day. Day's brigade of Benson's division, being in the centre, came up opposite old Spanish fort, the guns of which had good range through a large ravine. The Ninety-first Blinois was in the advance of that brigade with skirmishers deployed, and subjected the confederates to some loss in forcing them back over the fallen trees to their breastworks. When the hne halted, about nine hundred yards from those works, a portion of the skirmish line was reheved by Capt. Dutton's company of the Seventh Vermont who had four men shghtly wounded ; and there was one other wounded in the same regiment. During the afternoon, Grier's brigade furnished a detad to construct temporary works for the Twenty-first New York battery, which had taken position on a prominent spur near the right of that brigade. At dark, the Ninety-first Blinois and Twenty-ninth Iowa began intrenching, a httle in advance of the line occupied during the day, and the Fiftieth Indiana and Seventh Vermont took position two hundred yards in the rear. Col. D. P. Grier's brigade of the same division, after deploy ing, threw out the Ninety-sixth Ohio, Lieut.-Col. Brown, as skirmishers, and moving on, opposite Fort McDermett, passed"], [69, "57 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. through the right of Veatch's division where the men were intrenching and soon saw the confederate skirmishers approach ing over the brow of a hid in advance ; but meeting a wed directed fire from the Ninety-sixth Ohio they hastdy retreated to their works responding with only a few shots. The Ninety sixth then pushed forward about a hundred yards farther. This opened the way for the Seventh Massachusetts hght battery, Capt. Storer, to come up on a rise of ground seven hunched and fifty yards from McDermett, and in rear of which Grier's brigade constructed a cover. The Seventh Massachusetts bat tery was engaged for three hours. Ad along the line the regimental colors were planted in the ground, and afforded a mark for the confederate guns. In the Twenty-ninth Wisconsin, Slack's brigade of Veatch's division, the private Joel Norton, acting as color bearer, was kdled by a piece of shell, and a skirmisher of that regiment was wounded. Veatch's whole loss during the day was two kided and sixteen wounded. On the extreme left, and next to the bay, was Bertram's brigade, squarely in front of Fort McDermett, and the approach was difficult, on account of the obstructions of slashings. The Nineteenth Iowa, Lieut.-Col. John Bruce commanding, was in the advance. \"With skirmishers deployed, that regiment crossed an open field and coming into clear range of the guns of Mc- Dermett, pushed forward still farther into the fallen trees, but was greeted with a severe fire of artillery. The Nineteenth Iowa then hastily threw up some logs and earth for protection. Foust's battery (F, First Missouri) of steel guns, came up meantime, and soon, with its skilful fire, silenced the guns in McDermett. Several of the Nineteenth had been severely wounded and there was now some pause in firing on this part of the line. Meantime, the other regiments of the brigade, Twentieth Wisconsin, Twenty-third Iowa, and Ninety-fourth Eli-"], [70, "58 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. nois, came up, and Granger also came on the ground. Another advance was soon ordered. The Twentieth Wisconsin, Lieut.- Col. Starr, had formed on the right of the Nineteenth Iowa, and both regiments pushed forward over the slashed trees, but could not move fast. The confederates from the fort, and their advanced rifle-pits, were on the watch, and when they had gained about two hundred yards opened fiercely on them with mus ketry and artillery. To this fire they replied with spirit, and Foust's unerring guns in the rear were doing execution at every shot. In close musketry range of McDermett, both regiments began to construct rifle-pits, and pickets were posted on the farther side of a ravine which extended on the right nearly up to the road ; their post being close to rifle-pits from which the confederates had been driven. In the Nineteenth Iowa, Cor porals Geo. Major and Wm. Holliday, and Private Montgomery, were killed, and Corporal Fish of the color guard, and Corporals Loyle and Smith, and ten privates, were wounded. Capt. Stone of the Twentieth Wisconsin, a gallant officer and gentleman, was mortally wounded. By dusk, the general line of the Thirteenth corps was estab lished from eight hundred to one thousand yards from the main works of the confederates, and after dark large details were set at work intrenching ; and along the whole line the spade, the pick, and the axe, were busily employed. During the day, Granger with a staff-officer rode along the line of skirmishers, attracting a fire which struck down the orderly bearing the corps colors. The number of killed and wounded in the Sixteenth corps were ninety-one ; in the Thirteenth something less. According to the report telegraphed to Mobde, the confederates sustained a loss of only nine killed and thirty wounded. The garrison had been expecting an assault, and were saving the most of their fire for such an emergency. At four in the afternoon, Gen."], [71, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 59 Gibson reported : \" Enemy seem to be attacking here in earnest, and has opened on every part of the line, with musketry and hght artillery.\"1 Canby, however, did not intend to assault blindly ; nor would there have been much gained in point of time, for the army would have had to wait a few days for sup plies before moving farther. He accompanied the troops in the movement and established his headquarters on the main road, near Wilson's, two miles from Spanish fort. 1 Cribson to Lidett : \" March 27, 5:30 p. m. \u2014 We require more toots.

Patton had command of the artillery which was also armed with rifle muskets, and did duty in the pits ; Gibson's brigade Avas in the centre ; and the Alabama reserves \u2014 principally youths, under General Thomas, were on the left. And there were batteries under skilful artillerists distributed at the forts on the entire line. The garrison now saw they Avere to be regularly besieged by a large force, but were determined to hold out as long as they could without unreasonable sacrifice, and were inspired with the pride and satisfaction of holding at bay a poAverful and finely-equipped army. In the morning the public animals were shipped off, and renewed efforts made for additional tools. On the extreme left the defences were not finished, and these had been worked upon through the night, and were being continued. On that part of the hne, on the prececbug day, a party of blacks had been at work behind the skirmishers felling trees for an abatis in front of the main works ; but ran in before the skirmishers, and having got too \" demoralized\" to be useful in the garrison, were sent to Fort Huger. The work went on actively in completing platforms for the guns, making revetments for the breastworks and embrasures, and bomb-proof quarters for officers and men. These latter were along close to the main works. But more of this neces-"], [73, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 61 sary work could have been done if there had been a larger supply of tools.1 The besiegers, as well as the garrison, were experienced in such operations, and then: practice on the late march had given them fresh facility in constructing earthworks. The red lines of earth \u2014 Avhich will there remain for years to come \u2014 began to appear astonishingly quick ; and they were, indeed, needed as a barrier against the subtle Minie-balls of the garrison sharpshooters, who, to use a phrase that was soon current along the line, \" shot to kill.\" In the rear, the pioneer companies of each division, with details, were making gabions and fascines, levying heavily on the forest for its withes and poles. The abundance of pine-trees, many of which had been felled to impede them, largely assisted the men in making then- bomb-proof quarters, and the revet ments for batteries. There had been occasional shots during the night ; but when day broke, the crack of the musket grew vehement, and the ar tillery opened with spirit on both sides. The garrison, the day 1 Gibson lo Lidell: \" March 28. \u2014 The enemy attempted to advance his lines at sunset, but was\" wholly unsuccessful.

The fire from these guns ap peared effective at first, but one of the shot having struck inside the garrison, it was ordered to cease. Sixteenth Corps. \u2014 The Fourteenth Indiana (Morse's) fight bat tery \u2014 Carr's division \u2014 had, on the evening of the 27th, advanced to a prominent and exposed position, where a mortar battery of the Fust Indiana heavy artillery afterward came in, five hun dred and fifty yards from Red fort. The Fourteenth, aided by details of infantry, had worked all night throwing up works.; but the earth on that ridge was very hard, and by morning only a few logs were rolled together Avith scarcely enough earth to cover them. In pursuance of orders, however, Capt. Morse opened fire at daylight, and was speedfiy answered by Phillips' Tennessee and Lumsden's Alabama light batteries, in his front, which concentrated their fire on him. Morse continued firing till ten o'clock, when he ceased, so as to give the pioneers oppor tunity to strengthen the work, and while this was in progress the work was penetrated by a shell, which exploded, Trilling one man and fataUy wounding another. The other light guns on the left, in the front of both corps, were also engaged, but much exposed ; yet batteries for them were in progress. In the morning, an examination of the ground off from Carr's right, and along the eastern shore of Minette bay, showed that a battery could be placed on the bluff that would have a plung ing fire on Huger. A Whitworth and a steel rifle were put in position there, which drew the fire that had been renewed of Huger from the right flank of the Sixteenth corps, and also moved farther up the river a confederate gunboat, which had also been hurling at A. J. Smith's command large and demoral izing projectiles."], [75, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 63 The nature of the ground was such that on the extreme right of Smith's corps the One Hundred and Eighth Illinois \u2014 Geddes' brigade of Carr's division \u2014 Avas able to commence a parallel on a ridge two hundred yards distant from the confederate works ; and which, when finished, bent round to within one hundred and twenty yards of the confederate works. Toward the left the distance widened, the parallel commenced by the Eighth Iowa and One Hundred and Twenty-fourth Illinois being a httle over three hundred yards distant. Next in Moore's brigade the first line was three hundred and fifty yards distant, and in Ward's brigade five hundred. By daylight Moore's brigade had its first parallel opened, and some cover thrown up for the skirmish fine one hundred and fifty yards in advance. The loss during the day in Geddes' brigade was two wounded in the One Hundred and Eighth Illinois ; two \u2014 one dangerously \u2014 in the One Hundred and Twenty-fourth Illinois ; in the Eighth Iowa, David Sterrett, Company K, was killed, and Mandres, Company I, and Herz berger, Company G, wounded. In Moore's brigade, four were wounded in the Thirty -third Wisconsin, one in the Seventy-sec ond Hlinois, and four \u2014 one dangerously \u2014 in the Ninety-fifth Illinois. In Ward's brigade, four \u2014 one dangerously \u2014 were wounded in the Fourteenth Wisconsin, five \u2014 two dangerously \u2014 in the Fortieth Missouri. Also, among the wounded was Lieut. Joseph H. Mitchell, Company A, Forty-ninth Missouri. The preceding night, in the front of the Fortieth Missouri two colored men deserted from the garrison, and coming toward the picket of the Fortieth, were ordered to halt. One got frightened and ran, but the sentinel quickly fired, and he feU. The other came safely in, and the wounded one was sent to the hospital. In McArthur's division the casualties were : in McMillen's bri gade, two wounded in the Thirty-third Illinois ; in Hubbard's brigade, one wounded in the Ninth Minnesota ; in Marshall's brigade, two wounded in the Thirty-third Missouri, one in the"], [76, "64 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Twelfth Iowa, and Corporal Dreauler of the Seventh Minnesota. Company D, Capt. Norman Buck, of the latter regiment was on the skirmish line, and occupied ground three hundred and fifty yards from the confederate works. The Thirteenth Corps.\u2014 In. Krez's brigade, Benson's division, four companies from different regiments, under Captain James Gunn, Twenty-seventh Wisconsin, were sent out in dayhght to relieve skirrnishers of the Second (Day's) brigade who were in Krez's front. These companies had to cross a ravine containing a labyrinth of slashings, and which was commanded by the guns of McDermett and the sharpshooters posted in its front. But heedless of danger they made their way to the front as fast as possible, which could not be rapid even for sure-footed and athletic men ; drove some of the confederate skirmishers out of their pits, and pushed on to within two hundred yards or thereabouts, of the confederate battery No. 3 ; but losing heavily. The detail from the Thirty-thkd Iowa had eight wounded, one mortally, and four dangerously; and among the wounded from that regiment were Capts. Wdliani S. Parmlee and George R. Ledyard. The Twenty-eighth Wisconsin lost one killed, Private Samuel D. Hogg, Company B, and six Avounded, and the Twenty-seventh Wisconsin four wounded. So dangerous was it to retire or advance there in the daytime that some who were to be reheved preferred to remain in their pits iu the front. In Day's (Second) brigade, Company D, Capt. Geo. E. Croft, Seventh Vermont, had been on the skirmish line during the night and having pushed fonvard pretty close to the confederate works, was able to bring back valuable information concerning them. The skirmish line in front of Day's brigade was on the rise of ground before Battery No. 3, before mentioned, and so exposed to a raking fire of fight guns that the men were in constant peril ; for they were not yet well 'covered by works,"], [77, "65 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. and had to seek shelter behind logs to some extent, rendering their line irregular. At three in the morning, the Twenty-ninth Iowa \u2014 a regiment of splendid material and discipline to match \u2014 was relieved in the front, where it had been digging all night, by the Fiftieth Indiana \u2014 a regiment of the same distinguished merit, withdreAv a few hundred yards to the rear, but not out of range, \" and got something to eat, the first for nearly thirty-six hours,\" and then soon returned and resumed the labors of the trenches. Grier's (First) brigade was at work in the position taken the preceding evening. In Veatch's division next on the left, Dennis' (Second) brigade was in the front, the skirmishers being engaged with but httle intermission, and the fatigue parties exposed to considerable shelling. Attack on Captain Noble's Working Party. \u2014 At dusk, Capt. J. L. Noble, of the Twenty-first Iowa, Slack's brigade, with one hunched men of the Twenty-first armed, and a detail of three hundred men from other regiments without arms, a strange oversight, went to the front to work on a battery. The detail crawled along cautiously to the place designated, and com menced work. Capt. Noble put out pickets in his front with instructions to report to him every five minutes. Soon the garrison sharpshooters heard the noise of the tools and com menced an unpleasant fire. The party kept at their work, and it seems that some of the detail had stuck their guns Avith the bayonets on into the ground. About midnight, in the midst of a heavy rainstorm, they were surprised and attacked, the confederates having approached slyly to within a very few yards of the work before being discovered. It was even doubt ful for a few moments which side would get possession of the guns that were stuck in the ground. For a few minutes the combat was hand to hand. Capt. Noble called upon his men 5"], [78, "66 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. to stand by him, which they did, with spirit, and kept their assaflants out of the work. Many of the unarmed men ran back to camp, and some reported that Capt. Noble and his httle band were captured. But Capt. Noble said they were mistaken, though he admitted that \"at different times the rebs. were apparently standing guard over him.\" In about an hour Gen. Slack came out with his brigade to his relief, and the tide of the combat speedily turned. Capt. Noble had one man killed and five wounded, and a ball came so near himself as to burn his hair. He afterward learned from a confederate sergeant that the regiment that made the attack lost seven kiUed and fourteen wounded. The attack was general on the skirmishers of Granger's left at the same time, but no ground was anywhere lost. In Bertram's brigade, the Nineteenth Iowa was reheved in the morning by the Ninety-fourth Illinois, Col. John McNidta, which continued the work in the rifle-pits, and also sent three companies, under Capt. McFarland, to the front to support the Twenty-third Iowa. Operations of the Navy. \u2014 The fleet, under Acting Rear-Ad miral H. K. Thatcher, having several of the vessels that had gained renown under Farragut at Fort Morgan, had kept pace with the army up to the 26th. But Canby was disappointed in the expectation, that it might move up close to Spanish fort and complete the investment on the water side. Could this have been done the hours of Spanish fort would have been brief. But the shallow water on Blakely bar, the elaborate obstructions, and the torpedoes, prevented. The confederates first caught sight of a portion of the fleet about five o'clock on the afternoon of the 26th, when it was off the mouth of D'Olieve's creek On the 28th, the fleet was lying' off Howard's wharf. The pendant of the senior officer was flying from the Stockdale."], [79, "67 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE At midday the Octorara, Lieut.-Com. W. W. Low, and the river ironclad monitors, Milwaukie, Lieut.-Com. J. H. Gillis, the Kickapoo, Lieut.-Com. Jones, the Winnebago, Lieut.-Com. Kirkland, and the Chickasaw, got under weigh from the anchor age of the squadron and steamed for the bar of Blakely river. The ironclads passed successfully over the bar. But the Oc torara took the ground on the ridge of the bar in eight feet of water. The tide had commenced falling ; and at three o'clock, a tube having burst in her starboard boiler, further efforts to force her over ceased for the day. And, though she ulti mately gained distinction, it seemed necessary that she should yield to that fate which rules in war, and often interposes a trivial accident to prevent unmixed success. The Winnebago and Mdwaukie had Ead's turrets, admitting of an elevation to the guns of twenty degrees, and were permitted to advance. A trial shell was fired from the Winnebago when she was at the first rest, which showed she was much beyond the range of her guns from Spanish fort. Sinking of the Milwaukie. \u2014 Both steamers continued up the Blakely river, to within about a mile and a half of Fort McDer mett, and, with their Xl-inch guns, threw some shells at a transport, supposed to be carrying supphes to the garrison, and compelled her to move up the river. Some shots were directed at Spanish fort, which were thought by the besiegers to have done good execution ; and when the first shell came screeching up the bay, there was immense cheering all along their fine. They then returned to anchor. The Milwaukie, dropping with the current, her bow headed up stream, had got within two hundred yards of the Kickapoo, then at anchor, and was where boats had previously swept for torpedoes, and where it was sup posed there could be no danger from them. Just then a shock was felt on board, and it was known at once that a torpedo had exploded on her port side, abaft the after turret, and about forty"], [80, "68 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. feet from the stern. The first object of the commander, after realizing the impossibility of saving the vessel, was to save the crew, which was happily done. There was some confusion at first, for the hatches were closed, and but three were provided with levers to open them from below ; but a single command re stored order, and all came on deck in a quiet, orderly manner. The stem sank in about three minutes, but the forward com partments did not fill for nearly an hour afterward, giving the crew an opportunity of saving most of their effects. Lieut.- Com. Gillis saw every man off the vessel, and sent them to the Kickapoo. He then reported to the flagship, and obtained per mission to proceed to Pensacola, to get divers and a steam pump to aid in fetching up his guns.1 Col. McNulta's men, of the Ninety-fourth Illinois, up in front of McDermett, looked on the Milwaukie from the rifle-pits, after the accident, and said that her flag was still waving, and that her men, standing in water, were firing effective shots from her turret guns. And the officers of the garrison strained their eyes to see whether she had sunk or not.2 1 Lieut. Gillis' Report, March 30, 1865. 2 \" Skirmishing and artillery fire open lively on both sides as soon as light enough for good practice. Battery Huger opens on the enemy's right with good effect, but is stopped on account of an accidental shot having fallen in our lines. \" Fire on both sides abates toward midday.

March 29 \u2014 Operations of the Navy. \u2014 Those who merely con sider the brilliant results of military or naval operations know little of the tugging toil which generally attends their achieve ment. An example of this toil was seen in the experience of the fleet. The Octorara (as also the Metacomet) was a side-wheel steam-gunboat of the style familiarly called \" double-ender,\" having bow and stern constructed alike, of draught of from eight to ten feet of water, and fore-and-aft schooner-rigged. She carried two IX-inch guns, two thirty -two-pounders, and four twenty-four-pounder howitzers, as broadside, and one one hundred-pounder Parrott rifle, and one IX-inch smooth-bore as pivots ; with gun crews for the larger guns of seventeen men each.

And at noon, the 29th, with the assistance of two tugs, she passed over the Blakely bar, and anchored inside. The same evening the hundred-pounder Parrott was taken on board and mounted, and some shot and shell received from the tugs. But she did not open fire till the next day. Heavy detads from the squadron in boats had been industri ously sweeping the channel with chains for torpedoes, and many had been brought up."], [82, "70 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Sinking of the Osage.\u2014 At two, p. m., of the 29th, the ironclad Osage, Lieut.-Com. Wm. M. Gamble, was lying at anchor inside of Blakely bar in company with four other vessels. A strong breeze was blowing from the eastward, and the Winnebago had dragged close alongside. To avoid collision the Osage weighed anchor, moved off to a safe distance on her starboard bow, was stopped by her commander in two fathoms water, and hands ordered ready to let go the anchor. Almost immediately a torpedo exploded under the bow, and the Osage commenced filling and sinking rapidly. But search below for the killed and wounded was speedily made by executive officer Garrison with some men, and two killed and five wounded were passed up. Five were killed and twelve wounded. The Osage almost imme diately filled. Her position had been thoroughly dragged by boats ; and it was supposed the torpedo which struck her was drifting. Position of the Confederate Artillery. \u2014 Twenty-one batteries had been sent down from Hood's (or Johnston's) army to help defend Mobfle. Some of these had lost, and some had worn out their guns and material in resisting Sherman. Many of the companies had served from the commencement of the war, and had left dead comrades on more than a dozen great battle-fields, and now they were in conflict again with men, whom, in more hopeful days, they had met at Shdoh and Vicksburgh. Of these organizations the principal one was the Twenty second regiment Louisiana artillery, commanded by Col. Isaac Patton, a native of Virginia, and a graduate of West Point. He had command of the artillery at Spanish fort and Forts Huger and Tracy, and the latter forts were garrisoned mainly by com panies from his regiment. Forts Huger and Tracy were a thousand yards apart, built on the marsh, with piles driven for foundation ; were from one to two mdes above Spanish fort, and about the same distance from the"], [83, "71 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. main shore. As has been before remarked, they were designed to command Blakely river ; and it was an opinion expressed by Beauregard that they should be made seh-sustaining, and that no garrisons should be maintained on the main shore. Fort Huger was a work with four bastions, but open at the north end, was garrisoned by companies B and K of the Twenty-second Louisiana and Company C, First Mississippi hght artillery, Capt. Collins \u2014 total, two hundred effective, and commanded by Maj. Washington Marks, of the Twenty-second Louisiana. It was armed with eleven guns ; namely, one VHI-inch double banded gun in the northeast bastion, one VIrVinch Brooks rifle, and one X-inch mortar on east face ; one Vll-inch rifle at southeast bastion ; one X-inch double-banded smooth-bore on south face ; one Vll-inch rifle on southwest bastion ; one VIrVinch Brooks rifle on west face ; two twelve-pounder howit zers. In the centre was a bomb-proof, twenty-five feet high, on which were mounted on pintels two splendid X-inch colum biads, smooth-bore, having, of course, a wide range. Fort Tracy was an enclosed bastioned work, garrisoned by Companies I, H, and G, of the Twenty-second Louisiana \u2014 one hundred and twenty men, under the immediate command of Capt. A. A. Patsmier, Company I of that regiment, and armed with five Vll-inch rifle guns. It was supposed these forts would be assaulted by men landed from boats and launches, and the garrisons were exercising much vigilance to be ready to repulse them. Old Spanish fort, sometimes denominated the Water-battery, was garrisoned by Companies A, D, and F, of the Twenty second Louisiana, and well armed with VLI-inch columbiads and thirty-pounder Parrotts \u2014 five in all. Fort McDermett was under the immediate command of Capt. Samuel Barnes, Company C, Twenty-second Louisiana, and the artillery was manned by his own and Owen's Arkansas battery \u2014"], [84, "72 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. effective of both companies, ninety-one ; but it was reinforced on the following day by Massenbery's Georgia fight artillery, one hundred and ten effective. It had, at first, fifteen guns ; six six-pounder smooth-bore ; two twenty -four-pounder howitzers ; six cohorn mortars ; and one VITVinch Brooks rifle, mounted on centre-pintel, and having a range of three quarters of the cir cle of the besiegers' works. Its south bastion was a lunette of strong profile, a command of twenty-five degrees over ridge and road approaching it, a regular covered way Avith four embrasures, a carefully-con structed abatis and chevaux-de-frise, and many torpedoes made Avith twelve-pounder shell. With the exception of old Spanish fort, which, from its position, was unassaflable, this south bas tion was decidedly the strongest and most carefully fortified fort of the garrison works. Captain C. H. Slocum had command of the other batteries on the left. His quarters were at the redoubt No. 3, where was also his company \u2014 the fifth of the Washington artillery \u2014 ninety effective, composed of the best class of young men of New Or leans. During the war Slocum 's battery had marched six thousand miles. This redoubt (No. 3) was armed with eight pieces : one VHI-inch columbiad, two Napoleons, one Ill-inch rifle, and four cohorn mortars. At Redoubt No. 4 was Philhps' Tennessee battery, sixty effec tive, with two Napoleons, one twelve-pounder howitzer, and two cohorn mortars. Next, on the left of Redoubt No. 5, was Lums den's Tuscaloosa (Alabama) battery, with four six-pounders, and three cohorn mortars. The whole number of guns, including mortars, in all the works, the first days of the siege, was fifty-seven.

' It now commenced the use of steel screens in the embrasures. On the left of the besiegers Bertram's brigade had advanced some distance farther than the division on the right, leaving its right flank exposed. At seven in the afternoon, seven companies of the Twenty-ninth Illinois (third brigade of Veatch's divis ion), under Maj. E. P. Curtis, went out to the front to open a line of works connecting with Bertram's right. They had but fairly begun digging when a superior number of the garrison made a sally on them, under cover of the darkness, rushing boldly and impetuously up to the trenches as .if sure of success. A similar attack was made at the same time in Bertram's ad vance, but the working parties repulsed the attack, and resumed their work. About the same time the Eighth Illinois, Dennis' brigade, had one man killed and three wounded whde working on a battery. Adventure on the Skirmish Line. \u2014 In Day's brigade, Benson's division, Capt. L. K. Myers, Twenty-ninth Iowa, had the pre ceding evening been detailed as brigade officer of the day in the trenches. He had four companies, and was required to ad vance and dig rifle-pits within one hundred yards of the con federate works \u2014 then occupied by Gibson's Louisiana brigade, Col.

Capt. Myers and party dropped down, and quite a number of shots were fired over them. He whispered orders for each man to crawl back singly, and then crawled back himself. Each one was heard and fired at whde thus retreating, but none hit. Capt. Myers' detafi was at work through the night digging their line of rifle-pits, only fifty yards distant from the advance rifle-pits of the confederates and were being fired on by the latter, continually. The captain had repeatedly passed along the line of his four companies during the night, and toward morning, thinking they were safely intrenched, had started back to the main line of the brigade to report his situation, when he met a heutenant of his own regiment with seven men bringing out ammunition for a company (C), that had come with less than the required supply. The men bringing it had carelessly been sent without arms. He turned back to conduct them to the line and came to a pit \u2014 for the pits were detached \u2014 next to the one where the ammunition was to go, and a \" sentinel\" pointed him the way. In passing along the line at night he had been guided by a lone tree standing where Company C was stationed ; but approaching from the front it was hid, being between him and the high ground in front, and there being another tree more to the right, he followed that and came out unexpectedly on the confederate lines. His adventure was told as follows : \"I had ordered the heutenant and seven men to keep in single file, behind me, and make but httle noise in passing through the brush and fallen timber. As I approached I said : ' Boys, I am coming back again.' A voice ansAvered, ' Come on.'

As I halted, my men"], [87, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 75 closed up to my right, placing us all within three or four steps of the rebs. We all saw at once where we were. I was wearing a red sash, belt, and revolver ; and my men all unarmed. The rebel officer looked me close in the face, and said : ' Do you know where you are \u2014 do you belong to us ?' I answered ' Of course we belong to you, ain't you confederate soldiers ?' He answered ' Yes.' \" I asked, ' What regiment ?' \" He answered, ' Forty-second.' \" I said, ' We are bringing out ammunition, and wish to pass down the line with it, if you will direct us the way to the next post.' \"He asked, 'What regiment?' but I began to ask several other questions and each time set in before he finished, by making remarks such as, ' We heard so much firing during the night, thought you might be scarce of ammunition \u2014 were sent out with a supply, wish to pass down the hue if you wfil direct us to the next post.' He said, ' We will show you the way, it is not far ;' and turning to his men, said, ' Boys, all of you, come along.' I said, ' Very well,' and turning to my men said, ' Come on, boys.' \" I had feared that some of my boys would run and the rest of us be fired on, but they all stood quiet, trusting me to manage affairs. I knew the reb. knew what we were, and was afraid to order us to surrender ; perhaps wanted to first double his force at the next post. I wanted to get on the move, and give the word to my men to run. We had only gone a few steps when one of the rebs. next the officer said, ' Hold on, these are not our men !' I said, ' You are certainly mistaken ;' and whde trying to satisfy him, the officer became too much alarmed to stand it any longer.

I also drew my revolver and fired four shots. By this time my men had got started back. I turned to follow them, and was about to run on to their (confederate) advance sentinel, who was squatting down in the brush, and raised and fired, when I was within two or three feet of the muzzle of his gun, hit me in the right hip, the ball hitting the bone, glancing round, and coming out about five inches from where it went in. I fed beside him, and as he turned to run, I gavre him the two remaining shots from my revolver ; he fed within a few steps of me and lay quiet. I lay there a few minutes, and the rebs., from their breastworks some fifty yards distant, poured a heavy fire into the brush. I could see day breaking fast, and knew they could soon see me. So I began to crawl off. Could not stand on my wounded leg. Soon came to one of my boys, who had been with me and was lost in the brush. While he and I were cautiously making ourselves known to each other, two of our Company C boys, in their rifle-pits, raised their guns to fire at me, but their lieutenant (Stocker, one of my messmates) knew my voice, and told them not to fire. They then called me by name, ' Capt. Myers,' and the rebs., fodowing up behind me, caded, ' Come this way, Capt. Myers, come right this way.' Lieut. Stocker ordered a few shots fired at them, which stopped their hadooing, and I came into the rifle-pits with Lieut.

SIEGE OF SPANISH FORT\u2014 FOURTH DAY. March 30. \u2014 The fourth day was devoted chiefly to work in the trenches on the part of the besiegers. The pits had been dug hastily, and were narrow ; in many places the sides were not wed sloped but abrupt, so that a heavy storm would crumble them in. Orders were given to have them rectified, and widened to six feet. This was undertaken, but retarded for want of tools. The heavy siege guns were now on their way up the bay, and several batteries were also commenced for them. Foust's hght battery of steel guns, on the extreme left, had done excel lent service ; and his ammunition being exhausted \u2014 but not his zeal \u2014 he withdrew, and gave place to four ITI-inch rifle-guns, of Storer's Seventh Massachusetts, which were moved from the right of Veatch's division \u2014 the section of twelve-pounders of the latter battery, under Lieut. Benson, remaining in their original position. Four fight guns, of Trud's Fourth Massachusetts battery, were on Veatch's left, and only four hundred and fifty yards from Fort McDermett: \u2014 so near, indeed, that the men could hear the music of a brass band inside that fort. These guns were doing some good service. The other section of the battery, under Lieut. Briggs, had been sent to the extreme left, to fire on the garrison's transports coming to the wharf. Up to this time the besiegers had in use nine light bat teries. During this day a shed from Fort McDermett exploded in"], [91, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 79 the camp of the Twenty-ninth Illinois, Mlling four men and wounding nine others, ad of Company A. At three in the afternoon Veatch's division was withdrawn in order to proceed with a supply train to meet Gen. Steele ; and his front was occupied by Marshall's brigade of the Sixteenth corps. The whole loss in Veatch's division had been nine killed and forty-one wounded. In Day's brigade, Benson's division, the Twenty-ninth Iowa was detached to the rear on picket duty. In Carr's division a part of Moore's brigade front was severe ly enfiladed by guns off to his right, and which he coidd not reach ; probably Lumsden's Tuscaloosa battery. The part of Moore's front which was most exposed to this fire was occupied by two companies of the Thirty-third Wisconsin : Company C, Capt. William Were, Company K, Capt. A. H. Fitch. These officers, with their companies, without flinching, held their position under a raking fire. The regiment had eleven wound ed, six severely. But the guns that inflicted this injury were afterward sdenced by a Rodman gun of the First Indiana light battery which, at night, was placed in a masked position in front of the first paradel of Moore's brigade. The casualties in the two divisions during the day were five kflled and twenty-six wounded. On the extreme left the Louisianians, at about one in the morning, made another attack on Bertram's brigade front then occupied by the Ninety-fourth Illinois, Col. McNulta. The Nineteenth Iowa came up promptly to the assistance of the Ninety-fourth, and the sady party was driven back before ap proaching nearer than fifty yards, leaving nine dead which were buried by the Ninety-fourth.

The latter caded in his pickets, and about midnight his brigade was wending its way over Saluda hid and down the Pensacola road to Blakely landing, where it embarked on the steamers Mary and Red Gauntlet for Spanish fort. The casualties at Spanish fort, on the 30th, were reported to be six killed and forty wounded. But it is probable the lists of casualties could not always be accurate. Once the Nine teenth Iowa, on the extreme left of the besiegers, in extending their approach, dug into a confederate rifle pit where they found two or three confederates who had faden at their posts some time previously, and been left unburied by their comrades. The garrison during the day advanced the work on the tread way over the marsh to Fort Huger.2 1 Lidell to Gibson: \"Blakely, March 30. \u2014 Gen.

SIEGE OF SPANISH FORT\u2014 FIFTH DAY. March 31. \u2014 Detads from Carr's division had constructed a sunken battery on the shore of Bay Minette near the Whit worth and the steel gun already in position. Eight thirty pounder Parrotts, of Battery H, First Indiana heavy artdlery, Caps. W. P. Wimmer, and Battery K, Capt. Cox, had been placed there the night before, and in the morning opened on some ironclads and transports which were lying with steam up near Forts Huger and Tracy. Two side-wheelers and a trans port were in a few minutes compelled to move up stream ; but the fourth vessel was of the turtle-back description, and though repeatedly hit by solid shot remained under fire untd evening. About one, p. M., a transport attempted to pass down to the fort, but was driven back. The forts were continuady signalling, and twice in the following night a transport attempted to run cloAvn to them, but was driven back each time. Fort Huger answered the fire of these thirty-pounders briskly, but they sustained no injury. Capt. W. H. Blankenship, of the First Indiana heavy artillery, with his battery (B), eight Vlll-inch mortars, had arrived at Stark's wharf the night of the 28th, and, by working ad night in the heavy rain, got his battery on the top of the hid. The 29th, he moved out near Gen. A. J. Smith's headquarters. The 30th, the battery was divided, forty men and four mortars, under Lieut. Raper, being sent to the extreme left ; Avith fifty men and the other four mortars he proceeded to Carr's division ; and at 6"], [94, "82 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. three, A. m., of the 31st, had the mortars in position on a knod in rear of the left of Geddes' brigade (Battery No. 18), nine hun dred yards from Red fort, but only six hundred from the main works of the garrison in his immediate front. He commenced firing at eight o'clock, and fired thirty-eight rounds. In Granger's front, Capt. Bough (Battery C, First Indiana) got his Vlll-inch howitzers in position on the brow of a hid eight hundred yards from McDermett, and delivered an accu rate fire. There was a brisk engagement of the batteries on both sides all along the line. Morse's Fourteenth Indiana hght battery, at Carr's left, though its works had been strengthened, was much annoyed by Slocum's columbiad, from which sheds (weighing over fifty pounds) had been coming with their dismal flutter and with disagreeable precision. About ten, A. M., one of these shells struck a limber of the Fourteenth battery, and, igniting the contents (eighty pounds of powder), blew it in pieces, kdling one man, seriously wounding two, and slightly wounding several others. During the day, another man of the battery was dan gerously wounded by a Minie-bad. The First and Third Indiana and Second Iowa hght batteries were also actively engaged in the Sixteenth corps' front, and suffering but little. In the Thirteenth corps, the chief engineer, Col. Palfrey \u2014 son of the historian \u2014 designated the siege guns to be put in posi tion, with orders that twelve large rifle guns should be placed to give a reverse and enfilade fire on the left of the garrison's line, in front of the Sixteenth corps. Capt. Van Lieuw and Capt. Morton, of the Ninety-seventh United States colored in fantry, were assigned to duty with the corps as assistant-engi neers. The Seventh Vermont veteran infantry and the Thirty fifth Wisconsin infantry, of Benson's division, were assigned to special duty on siege-works, were diAdded into four reliefs, to"], [95, "83 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. work eight hours each in succession ; and the two officers named above, with Capt. H. G.

On the right of the Thirteenth corps, the Twenty-first and Twenty-sixth New York light batteries maintained the battle against large projectiles wed, and were the theme of praise among the infantry regiments around them. In the Twenty first, Privates John Wdson and John Daley had been kdled, and Private George A. White wounded \u2014 the first casualty on the 27th, the two last on the 29th. On Granger's left, the four hght guns of Trull's Fourth Massachusetts battery were withdrawn, to give place to Mack's (Black-horse battery) eighteen-pounders. In Bertram's front, two of the VLTI-inch (sixty-four-pounders) mortars of Battery B, First Indiana heavy artillery, opened on Fort McDermett.1 A Gallant Exploit. \u2014 The hulk of a steamboat, used as quar ters at Fort Huger, having been cut loose to give range to guns, floated down and lodged diagonady opposite McDermett, and about five hundred yards distant.

But they made their way through the shower of shot and shells to the object of their trip, coody boarded and examined it, returned to their skiff and paddled themselves back, but now under cover of the fire from the squadron. None of them was harmed, though their skiff was hit a number of times. And as they came back they were greeted by the loud cheers of thousands of their comrades, who stood watching them from the bluff. The garrison also beheld and admired their gallantry. Sortie and Capture of Skirmishers. \u2014 On the night of the 30th, Capt. R. B. Steams, Company K, Seventh Vermont, with a part of his company, had relieved Capt. Parker's company on the skirmish line in front of the confederate battery No. 3. There was a httle firing during the night, and Capt. Stearns advanced his hne about twenty-five yards, and dug new pits \u2014 though there was only one spade found by the detad \u2014 which brought him in advance of the brigade line of skirmishers. He was within one hundred and fifty yards of the works of the garrison, and the musket fire by his men was exceed ingly troublesome to their gunners. Soon after noon a shot from that vicinity had instantly killed Col. Wm. E. Burnett, of Texas, confederate chief of artdlery, and a valuable officer. He had for a moment taken a rifle in his hand, and was in the act of aiming it from behind the breastworks through a wooden embrasure. Capt. Barnes in Battery McDermett had been giving considerable attention to these skirmishers, and they were also subject to a fire from Red fort. Beginning early in the morning Barnes sheded the fine with a six-pounder and a twenty-four-pounder howitzer for three or four hours, and made some of the men on Stearns' left fad back into the ravine. There was now a hdl, and the skirmishers popped out their heads and did some firing them-"], [97, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 85 selves, for they were fair marksmen, and had plenty of pluck. Barnes then brought out two six-pounders from McDermett, placed them on the hid-top, and again fiercely sheded Capt. Stearns' position. The latter concluded it would be best to fad back a short distance as soon as it became dark, and sent Cor poral Crothers to regimental headquarters for instructions. He also sent word that he expected to be assaulted before dark, asked that the guns over at McDermett be silenced, and the works of the garrison in his front be sheded, so that he could fad back under cover of the fire. The severe fire which Capt. Stearns was exposed to had already attracted the attention of Col. Holbrook, the commanding officer of his regiment. Arrangements were made in the garrison for a sortie. Capt. Clement Watson of Gen. Gibson's staff volunteered to lead it. The rest of the party was to consist of Lieut. A. C. Newton, Company E, Fourth Louisiana battalion, and thirty men, fifteen of whom were picked. At two o'clock in the afternoon, preparatory to the sortie, the garrison caused the slashings and brush on the right of Capt. Stearns to be fired, and the smoke blew over and in front of him. Having stood the terrific shelling, he was now most appre hensive of being burned or smoked out, for there were several trees near him, and the wind was sending the fire in his direc tion. He gave the order for his men to fad back singly. But a hundred bullets came flying at the first man who started, and Capt. Stearns immediately countermanded the order. During the severe sheUing a few of his men had retreated from their rifle-pits, one of whom, Private Stoors, was wounded. Just be fore sunset the fire had extended along his rear and on his left, making so dense a smoke as to entirely seclude him. But the guns of the garrison were stdl bearing on him and now opened in a terrific manner. In less than ten minutes fifteen sheds"], [98, "86 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. were exploded inside, and directly over the single pit in which Capt. Stearns and ten of his men were stationed. Stdl ex pecting an assault he ordered his men to fix bayonets. It was now sunset. The cannonading ceased. The same instant Capt. Watson and party were over the garrison works, and, concealed by the smoke, vigorously rushed upon their ex pected prisoners. Capt. Stearns gave the command to fire, which was obeyed by a majority of his men. The next moment every man had a musket at his head, with a summons to surren der. The demand was complied with. Capt. Stearns and twenty of his men were captured. Without parley and without delay, then; captors received their arms and hurried them away into the garrison. None of the sortie party stopped to occupy the pits.1 The prisoners were rapidly taken a roundabout way to a position near the water, which appeared to be sheltered from the fire of the besiegers by artificial ravines. But no curi osity now inspired them to notice the interior of the garrison. They were confident their gadant comrades left behind would, before many days, have full possession of everything around them ; and the regret that they could not be present to partici pate in the enthusiasm of victory, increased that distress of mind which is ever experienced by the patriotic prisoner. The prospect before them was dreary. Capt. Stearns was soon notified that he was to have an inter vieAV with the general commanding the garrison ; and was accordingly conducted down into a ravine some sixty or seventy feet deep, and about thirty yards wide at the opening.

In the apex were two wad tants, into one of which he was taken and in troduced to Gen. Gibson, ihere were present Capt. Watson and the lieutenant who accompanied him. The general invited Capt. Stearns to partake of his supper \u2014 a frugal repast, con sisting of cold fowl, cold water, with tin table furniture. This in vitation was accepted. It was a compliment which would have been paid only to a gallant officer. The garrison had the best opportunity to judge of the courage and fortitude of their pris oners, and the general was generous in acknowledging the tenacity and courage with which, under a most severe fire, they held to their position ; and the intedigence and address of both the captors and prisoners seems to have excited mutual respect. After Capt. Stearns' interview with the general, and he had withdrawn from his tent, he had some conversation with persons of lower rank, from whom he learned that they had \" lost heart\" in the success of the Confederacy.1 The casualties of the garrison on the 31st were reported to be six killed and twenty-six wounded. 1 \" Headquarters Forces, Spanish Fort, \" March 31, 1865. \" The commanding officer desires to make known to the troops his admira tion of their unsurpassed valor and endurance, and his entire confidence in their ability to defend this outpost of the defences of Mobile. \" Thousands of your countrymen Avith anxious hearts turn toward you. \" Continue to prove yourselves worthy of their confidence, and of the cause which it is your privilege to defend. \" Resolve to do your Avhole duty, every hour of each coming day, and with the blessing of Heaven we shall continue to achieve those successes Avhich so far have croAvned your efforts.

The garrison did not as yet feel much pressed, but was obhged to work industriously. Orders were now issued to economize ammunition, and immediate leave of absence for twenty-four hours was promised each man who would pro cure twenty-five pounds of lead. This caused many hun dred pounds of the besiegers bullets to be picked up. On the right, in McDermett, Capt. Barnes received from Mobile, two twenty-pounder Parrotts, and one \"Vlll-inch mortar.

In the night, two ten-pounder rifles, of Grayson's battery, moved out from Blakely and occupied the position, which was only about one thousand yards from the battery on Bay Minette shore. Scarcely any work was done, for it was un necessary, as the position was masked by the woods ; and, as Steele was approaching from the north, it was evident the guns could not remain there long. Grayson opened at daylight with the two rifled guns, and with decided effect. His firing was not whody unexpected to Capt. Wimmer, for he had heard the noise of work in that direction the preceding night. Gray son kept up a constant and accurate fire, raking the Bay Mi nette battery from right to left. Wimmer had no protection on his right, and his magazine was exposed. Nor was he able to return Grayson's fire. He immediately commenced throwing up works to protect his magazine, his subordinate officers and men working with great intrepidity and zeal. All this whde a heavy fire was going on between his guns and Fort Huger and the gunboat Morgan. At half-past four, p. m., he had constructed works to effectively secure his magazine, left. No signs of regular sapping on the part of the enemy, as yet ; his ap proaches having been made up to this time by his skirmishers advancing them selves at night, and protecting themselves by irregular pits. Their proximity is such, in front of our salients, that I determine to try some countermines, and order preparation made to that end. Enemy opens several mortars on Spanish fort. Capt. Grayson's battery of Parrotts, and the confederate steamer Mor gan, open fire on Bay Minette batteries. Enemy appears in front of Blakely, and captures about one hundred men of the Forty-sixth Mississippi regiment by a dash on our outpost.\", \u2014 Diary of a Co?ifederate Officer."], [104, "92 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. and also got one gun in position to answer Grayson. But the latter had, by this hour, been caded back with his guns inside the works at Blakely. It had been a furious day for Wimmer and Cox's batteries, yet they had but three men injured. Capt. Blankenship commenced work with his VHI-inch and X-inch mortars (left of Geddes' brigade, Carr's division), at half-past seven o'clock, A. m. \u2014 fired fifteen rounds, and received orders to cease firing. At noon he opened again, and threw forty-seven sheds into Red fort, out of fifty-one fired, dis mounting a gun and killing two men. Late in the evening, he threw twenty-nine more sheds inside the garrison works. Hendrick's Battery L, First Indiana, having arrived the previous evening, two of his thirty-pounder Parrotts, under immediate command of Lieut. Parker, opened a direct fire, early in the morning, from McArthur's right, and were imme diately answered by a concentrated fire from six guns, mcluding one VHI-inch columbiad. Gun No. 3, Corporal James Busby, gunner, dismounted one of the garrison guns during the first day's firing. Some brdliant shots were made by the ITI-inch rifles of the Seventh Massachusetts \u2014 they having struck the Brooks rifle, in Fort McDermett, five times while it was being fired twice. Along the line, generady, there was not so much artidery firing as on the preceding day. In the Thirteenth corps work was progressing on three heavy batteries \u2014 Nos. 1, 2, and 5. After dark Capt. Mack had his eighteen-pounders hauled into position with ropes, by hand, and got ready to open fire the fodowing morning. Bertram's brigade, on the left, was pushing its advance line up to McDermett rapidly, day and night. But it had some natural advantage in approaching under cover of the west slope of the bluff on which the extreme left of their line rested. This"], [105, "93 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. afforded at least one approach ; yet the side of the bluff was steep, and considerable work had been done to excavate from its side a terrace-walk. Starting from the rear line, where the view of the bay and islands was extensive, the skirmish ers went doAvn a few steps to the terrace-walk, or covered way, and passing along that some hundreds of yards, they turned to the right, into an approach, and then, going another hun dred yards, came into their present advance line of continuous rifle-pits, which was now less than two hundred yards from the guns of McDermett. This day the Ninety-fourth Illinois was on duty at the front, and one of its men (Thomas Wdson, of Company A) was killed. Next, on the right of Bertram, was Marshad's brigade of the Sixteenth corps, occupying and advancing the works commenced by Veatch's division ; its right resting in the deep ravine which was in range of the guns of Old Spanish fort. Next, on the right, was Grier's brigade of Benson's division, in which Capts. G. G. Stearns, of the Seventy-seventh Illinois, and Campbed, of the Ninety-sixth Ohio, had been detaded to take charge of work in the trenches. The Twenty-eighth and Seventy-seventh Illi nois were in front, and at night a sortie was made on their skir mish line, which was handsomely repulsed. Next, on the right, Day's brigade (Benson's division) was re duced to two regiments, the Fiftieth Indiana and Ninety-first Illinois ; and on the right of that was the brigade of Col. Krez, whose skirmishers were holding an exposed position, and meet ing with some loss. The left of the Sixteenth corps was now Hubbard's brigade (Me Arthur's division), in whose front an approach had been extended to within two hundred yards of the main works of the garrison, and his second paradel there constructed. This was manned with two hundred and fifty of the best sharp shooters of the brigade, under charge of Capt. A. P. French,"], [106, "94 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Fifth Minnesota ; the detad being permanent. The operations in that brigade were conducted with equal vigor and system. The loss in the brigade, during the day, was, in the Thirty third Missouri, three kifled and wounded, including Capt. W. L-win ; in the Fifth Minnesota, one wounded. In McMiden's brigade, there was one kided in the Twenty-, sixth Indiana, and one wounded in the Thirty-third Illinois. In Carr's division, the works were also progressing with vigor. Moore's brigade, in the centre, at night, commenced work on a third paradel, thirty yards in advance of the second. The casualties in the division were two kdled and eight wounded, two of the latter mortady. The Navy. \u2014 On this day another vessel was sunk by a tor pedo. At one, P. M., the tinclad steamer Rodolph, Acting Master N. M. Dyer, in obedience to signal from flagship, weighed anchor, passed within had, and, receiving orders to take a barge alongside containing apparatus for raising the Mdwaukie, proceeded with it inside the Blakely bar. The Ro dolph had crossed the bar, and was standing up toward the wreck of the Mdwaukie, when, at 2:40, p.m., being directly between the Chickasaw and Winnebago, she exploded a torpedo under her starboard bow, and rapidly sank in twelve feet of water. It appeared that a hole had been made in her ten feet in diameter. By this casualty four of her crew were kdled and seven wounded, of whom five were colored men. Here, for a short time, let us withdraw attention from the operations at Spanish fort, and observe the movement of Steele's column out from Pensacola."], [107, "CHAPTER XIII. OPERATIONS OF STEELE'S COLUMN FROM PENSACOLA BAY. Maj-Gen. F. Steele arrived at Barrancas on the 28th of Feb ruary, and assumed command of the troops operating from Pensacola bay. The Second and Thud brigades of the Second division, Thirteenth army corps, with the Second Connecticut and Fifteenth Massachusetts light batteries, five thousand two hundred effective men, were already at that place and in readi ness to march. A few days afterward Hawkins' colored divis ion, five thousand five hundred effective, arrived, and by the middle of March, Lucas' cavalry brigade, two thousand five hundred, had landed. The whole force amounted to thirteen thousand two hundred. Steele at once, in person, began a thorough inspection of his troops ; taking one regiment at a time (formed in column of companies), and going through it examining the arms, accoutre ments, and clothing of each soldier. A heavy pontoon train had arrived, and Capt. Boyle of the Thirty-fourth Iowa drdled his company successfully in the prac tice of laying the bridge, but Gen. Steele wisely concluded to leave it behind. On the 10th of March, the Second division got orders to move to Pensacola, and repair the wharf. This was in order that the place could be avadable as a depot and base, if subsequent operations should require it. The same afternoon the division commander went up to Pensacola in a tug and ascertained what work needed to be done."], [108, "96 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. At sunrise the next morning (March 11), the division was a mde from camp, just entering the woods on the eastern part of the peninsida, with the train of eighty wagons of sup plies. The distance round the head of the bayou to Pensacola is thirteen miles, the road sandy and very heavy. It was the same road over which Jackson marched in 1818 with his army of three thousand men and two pieces of artdlery. Some of the road was under water ; and it was also necessary to construct a few smad bridges. Two mdes out of Pensacola, the road for several hundred yards was obstructed with slashings of pine trees ; but these were cut and roded out of the way in a most rapid manner by the pioneer company, assisted by detads from the column. The advance guard, consisting of a detachment of the Second Maine cavalry, entered the town soon after noon, and by three, p. m., the division was on its camping ground. The Second brigade (Spiceley's) camped on the ridge south of the old fort ; the Third brigade (Moore's) camped on the level ground east of the radroad. The march had been pleasant and successful. The next day, being Sunday, repairs of the wharf were not frdly commenced, yet Mr. Gray, principal mechanic in the quar termaster's service, arrived from Barrancas with a detad of some fifty men from the colored regiment, with tools, and commenced taking up plank and caps from another wharf. The repairs that were to be made consisted chiefly in driving pdes and making new wharf to fid up two gaps, each three hunch-ed feet in length, in the central or main wharf. The next morning, seventy pine logs for pdes were hauled from the neighboring woods to the wharf before eight o'clock; and during the day two hundred were cut and hauled ; and also sharpened. Mr. Gray was assisted by the Pioneer corps and detads from the division, and ad engaged worked in an earnest-hearted manner. Nearly ad the planks and caps needed Avere brought in boats from the"], [109, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 97 neighboring wharf ; and one pile was nearly driven when the wind and waves rose and stopped the work. There being no pde-driver, the piles had to be worked into the ground by their own weight. For example, a pde having been placed upright, a rope was then made fast near the top ; and while the pde was kept steady, it was swayed backward and forward by men pud ing on two sides tid it became firmly set in the ground. The next day the storm continued and no work could be done. On the 15th it Avas resumed. It was also concluded to lay a radway track from the end of the wharf, when it should be repaired, up the main street as far as the quartermaster's and commissary's stores. Capt. McComas, acting engineer, and a detad from the Eighty-third Ohio, under officers of radroad experience, then commenced taking up the track and ties on the Montgomery railroad. On the afternoon of Saturday, the 18th, the work was entirely finished. The wharf was made service- able and strong ; eight hundred yards of radroad completed, a platform car made and put on it in running order. This was ad done in five and a had days. Though the work was done to provide for a future contingency, the industrious men who per formed it had the pleasure of seeing it avadable the next day, in landing and bringing up supplies. Pensacola at that time was indeed remarkable for its ruined and lonely condition. It appeared once to have contained five thousand inhabitants ; but it did not then have a hundred. It had been raided upon by troops on both sides. Apparently the best part of the town had been swept away by fire. Amid the ruins, the shrubbery, and here and there delicate flowers, recalled a period of taste, if not of affluence. But now there was not a dozen sound buddings in the town, and not a single shop doing business. Not knowing how long they would remain, the troops hand somely pohced their camp and parade grounds, and budt"], [110, "98 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. quarters ; using for the latter materials from the ruined build ings in town. Nor did they neglect to devote some hours to military exer cises. Information of the movement of these troops from Barrancas (famiharly known in that neighborhood as the \"Navy-yard\") reached Gen. Maury in Mobde in about thirty-six hours after they had started; but their number was estimated at about four times what it actuady was. 1 At that time the confederates 1 Lidell to Maury : \"Blakely, March 12, 1 a. m. \u2014 Despatch from Greenwood that enemy left navy-yard early yesterday morning (the 11th) in direction ol Gonzalis.

On the 12th, Gen. Lided telegraphed Col. Armistead at Canoe station that the federals had moved out from Pensa cola. This was a mistake, and must have led to some uncer tainty. Col. Armistead comphed with the urgent appeals made to him to send scouts down to Pensacola. On the 15th, a smad party of confederates appeared in front of the picket four miles out on the Podard road, but without accomplishing anything further than obtaining a glimpse of the picket. This led to the strengthening of the cavalry picket on that road with a company of infantry so disposed as to render the capture of a smad party probable if they had again appeared. The confederates were no less vigilant and eager. Gen. Lided had instructed his outposts with a view of capturing any federal scouts or picket that might be sent out, speciady enjoining them \" to be certain of capturing the whole party, so that the enemy will not know what has become of them.\"-1- On the 19th, Gen.

The same day, Lieut.-Col. Spm-ling, with eight hun dred cavalry, went on transports to the east shore of the Black water, and thence moved to strike the radroad above Podard. On the 20th, Steele's command moved out from Pensacola on the Podard road, with ten days' rations \u2014 five carried by the men and five in the wagons. There were about two hundred and seventy wagons in the whole column. Each division took charge of its own train. The Second division of the Thirteenth corps had the advance, and started at dayhght. It was fodowed by the colored division. The cavalry brigade (except the Second Illinois, which embarked with Spurting) left Pensacola at three, p. M., and bivouacked at ten, p. m., four miles out, the roads having been badly cut up by the infantry. The Second divis ion, being in the advance, moved along pleasantly, halting ten minutes every hour, and went into camp by noon, at the Twelve mde house, in a pine forest, where the ground sloped a few hundred yards down to a clear stream. Each regiment came up in handsome style, with the music playing. Moore's brigade had been seen by confederate scouts, and the number of regi ments counted, eight miles out from Pensacola.1 A few wagons of the train had sunk down to the hubs in the sand in some places, and these were not up till after dark. Haw kins' division went into camp not far from the Second, before dark. The picket on the road was posted a mile and a half out. It was in charge of Capt. Rockwed, Thirty-fourth Iowa, who had his men so arranged as to have captured any confederate scouts if they had ventured closely up. Before midnight, a 1 Capt. Lewis to Col.

It was the same storm that impeded the column marching up the eastern shore of the bay to Fish river. The ground was, in many places, so flooded, the troops were driven from their slumber and rest before morning. At dayhght of the 21st, Spiceley's brigade, of the Second division, moved out of camp, and pursued the march. Moore's brigade remained, to take charge of the division train. As soon as it was fight, the artillery and the wagons attempted to get out of park and move on. Then appeared a most dis couraging and dismal prospect. The ground, seeming to be a mere crust, which the fading torrents had softened and dis solved, many of the wagons and artillery carriages had actuady sunk down to the hubs in the very tracks where they had stood. The thought occurred to every one that he was indeed in the midst of the Florida swamps ! In the midst of large trees, where the ground was covered with a thin grass, and with every indication of its being firm and solid, the wheels would sink down, and the mules, in their struggles to draw, would themselves plunge into the quicksand, and require assistance to get out. Then wagons would be unloaded, and, after moving a httle way, and getting upon what seemed firm ground, would be reloaded. The men pushed from behind, and tugged at every wheel. In some cases ropes were hitched to the wagon-tongues, and the men laying hold, pvdled the loaded wagons a considerable distance. Meantime, the pio neers were busy with their axes, cutting down small trees to corduroy the road. At first only bad places would be cordu royed. But these were constantly occurring ; for, if one team passed safely, the next was liable to be stalled, if it fodowed in the same track. It seemed desirable to avoid corduroying the entire road, yet it would, perhaps, have been economy of"], [114, "102 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. labor to have done so. During the day Moore's brigade performed much work on the road, and in getting the train along. The division marched only three mdes, and camped near the Fifteen-mde house. The most of the train was up by dark. The division commander had waited to see the artidery and teams get started, and to judge how far they could move during the day. He then, with the staff, passed on, and over took Spiceley at eight o'clock, not far from the point where it was intended to camp. The rain was stdl falling. Spiceley had his brigade drawn up in line on the right of the road, in closed ranks, the men with their odcloths (\u00a3>o?ic7*os) on, standing at secure arms, with a cheerful expression of coun tenance. The fine brass bands of the Twenty-fourth Indiana and Seventy-sixth Illinois struck up inspiring music. It was like a review \u2014 a singular spectacle, but one delightful to the soldier. None but a natural soldier would have conceived the idea. The cavalry brigade started at noon, and marched three mdes only, such were the difficulties of the road, and bivouacked at dark. Steele did not move his quarters, but was active in help ing along the column. A large mad having arrived, was dis tributed in the afternoon. The next day, the 22d/ was pleasant. Spiceley's brigade fur nished large detads to improve the road four mdes to the front. Before noon, Hawkins' division got up near the Fifteen-mile house, and camped. Lucas' cavalry arrived late in the after noon. About noon, Steele, with the division commanders, ex amined the road three mdes to the front. The inspector exam ined the wagons, and caused some hundreds of pounds of baggage to be abandoned. The confederates were stdl using every exertion to ascertain Steele's force and purpose. Their latest information estimated"], [115, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 103 his strength at thirty thousand. About the same time, they learned that Thomas was sending down forces from the north. 1 The march was resumed the following morning, March 23d. The cavalry was in the advance, immediately fodowed by Haw kins' division. In the Second division the artillery and wagon train began to hitch up at nine o'clock, and the division, was on the march by ten. But the road was so cut up by the trains in advance, that Spiceley's brigade, having charge of the train of the Second division, had to renew its labor on the roads before it was a mde from camp, and was, in fact, busy corduroying much of the ten mdes to Pine Barren creek. A detachment of confederate cavalry under Lieut.-Col. Leary was watching Steele's advance, and occasionady from behind log breastworks on a favorable crest attempted to hold him in check. Early in the forenoon there was considerable noise of musketry, and the Thirty-first Massachusetts, Lucas' rear battalion, was caded to the front in a gallop. But the obstruc tion was not serious ; and before reaching Pine Barren creek the confederates filed off toward the north, for they knew the bridge was destroyed, and that the stream was not fordable. 1 Lidell to Armistead: \" March 22.\u2014 Let me know what is going on in your front.\" Lidell to Maury : \" March 22, 5 : 15, a. m.\u2014 I received the enclosed despatches about midnight, and send them to you by first boat.

The enemy's strength being, however, ten thousand less [despatch had estimated Steele's force at forty thousand] in this last. You will see that Gen Thomas co-operates from Vicksburgh simultaneously. I now think there ean be no longer any doubt upon the subject. It is sad to think of the desolation that will follow the traces of these columns of devastating Yankees ! ! ! I have nothing late from the force coming up by Fish river. I can only conjecture that if sufficiently large, it will attempt to get possession of Spanish fort for 3 base, whence occupation can be given to the fleet in the bay. In carrying through the movement on Selma, the use of the Alabama river is of the utmost importance to the enemy ; hence I don't think we will be permitted to remain in quiet long.\""], [116, "104 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Their loss had been one killed and one captured. At noon, Steele, being at the front, came to where the ground begins to descend to the Pine Barren. It was a mde from that stream. Just there was a farm under fair tillage, and on both sides of the road a high rail fence. Four mdes off to the right could be seen the high and wooded bank of the Escambia, having a pictm-esque appearance. From this point of observation to the Pine Barren the descent was some three hundred feet ; but there were several intervening bids, and on both sides of the road an open pine forest. Gen. Steele soon ascertained the condition of Pine Barren creek ; that it was ten feet deep, its banks widely overflowed, and the current violent ; also that the bridge was destroyed. Companies A and D, Capt. Bond, and Lieut. Bond of the Thirty-first Massachusetts, crossed the stream, dismounted, on driftwood, and after exchanging a few shots with the confederate picket, drove it away, and remained there themselves as a picket. One confederate was wounded. Capt. Newton, assistant-engineer on Gen. Steele's staff, soon after commenced the construction of a bridge assisted by large detads from the infantry. The cavahy went into camp on the left side of the road a few hundred yards from the creek, and on high ground. Hawkins' division about opposite on the right of the road. The Second division coming up by the middle of the afternoon camped on both sides of the road in rear of the other troops. Steele's tents were pitched on the left of the road in the centre of his command. By direction, the troops repeated the evening cad twice to give the confed erates an exaggerated impression of their number. The weather continued pleasant on the 24th. Lucas had scouts out to Williams' station, and some infantry of the Second division were sent down to the Escambia landing, to look for steamboats, which were expected from Barrancas with supphes. But some accident prevented their arrival. Captain Newton,"], [117, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 105 though in poor health, continued hard at work, constructing the bridge, and much of the time was in the water. He was assisted by Captain Pickering's pioneers, and other detads. White and colored troops were working together. At about three o'clock in the afternoon, he said it would be finished in an hour, which was sooner than the commanding general expected. This informa tion was immediately communicated unofficiady to Gen. Lucas, who ordered \" Boots and Saddles\" to be sounded, then to Gen. Hawkins, and then to Gen. Steele, who at once sent out orders for the command to move that evening. The bridge was finish ed at the time specified ; and was three hundred feet in length. Considering that the logs had to be newly cut and carried some little distance, that the current was deep and SAvift, that its banks were flooded bottoms, covered with timber and under brush, difficult to move about in, a bridge of that kind to be made in one day, is a respectable achievement. Yet it was no singular instance of the soldier's enterprise and tod. The cavalry began to cross as soon as the bridge was done. Its wagon train moved tardily. It had to descend a steep hill, terminating at the river bank, and the road being much washed the wagons could not well be held back, and were in danger of striking against trees. At that late h/mr, a few trees had to be chopped down, and some other work done on the road. The Second division had moved out of camp and had to sit down on the road side tid the teams had got over. Spiceley's brigade was the advance of that division and the Sixty-ninth Indiana, Lieut.-Col. Perry, was down at the river bank. Next to the bridge, the road, for one hunched feet or more, was covered with water a foot deep ; and the men of that battalion had taken off their shoes and stockings, and roded up then- trowsers, so as to be ready to wade to the bridge. It was nearly dark before the cavahy Avagon train was over. The Second division then fol lowed. There was but a slight rise of the ground from the"], [118, "106 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. north bank, and the surface was thickly wooded with pine. The artillery and wagons of the Second division had moved but a few rods after crossing the Pine Barren, tdl the wheels began to sink down horridly. Moore's brigade had charge of the train, and the men had to resume the tod of corduroying. The artidery and tram got a mde and a quarter from the river at about eight o'clock in the evening, and bivouacked on rather high ground, had a mde from the cavalry. The colored division did not move tid morning. Lucas had pickets out about two mdes to the front, and during the night their shots were fre quently heard. In course of the day, his scouts had brought in a Mr. Wd lianis as prisoner, who imparted to Gen. Steele some informa tion respecting the roads, and was detained by the latter till the next day. He acquired the impression that Gen. Steele was moving on Montgomery, which was not singular. Nor was it strange that a citizen should estimate his force to be twenty-five thousand. But that it should be thought he was taking five hundred pieces of artillery through the swamps of Florida, must indeed be considered an extraordinary esti mate.1 1Lidell lo Maury: \" Blakely, March 25. \u2014 The following despatch has just been received from Col.

Steele's column moved out on the morning of the 25th, at dayhght, with expectations of a fight. Scouts had brought reports the evening before, that two brigades of confederates) with artidery, were intrenched on some creek a few mdes ahead, and intended to make a determined resistance. The picket firing, which had been heard in the night, and other circum stances, seemed to render the report probable. Lucas's troops encountered slight resistance when three mdes out. At nine o'clock, they reached Mitched's creek, on the opposite bank of which a cavalry force of about four hundred, under Col. Charles P. Bad, was intrenched. Some distance in Bad's rear was Clanton's brigade, as a reserve. The bridge had been partly destroyed. The banks, though not high, were skirted with a thick growth of shrubbery, which was material as a cover and defence. Having learned the nature of the force in his front, Lucas sent a detachment of the Second New York veteran cavalry, under Col. Christler, through the woods to the left, to cross the stream, if practicable, a mde above, and come in on the right flank and rear of the confederates. He then caused three companies of the First Louisiana cav- alry to dismount and cross the stream below. They attacked Bad's left with great spirit, and, after a short contest, made him abandon his position. This firing was plainly heard by the federal infantry. The Second division fodowed the cavahy. And at about ten, A. m., an orderly brought word from Gen."], [120, "108 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Lucas, that he had met the enemy and captured three or four of them. Col. Christler returned, not having found a crossing. After causing the bridge to be repaired, so the horses could pass over safely, Lucas moved forward at a trot, with the First Louisiana and a portion of the Second New York. He met the confederate forces at Cotton creek, and again at Canoe creek, but at each place his men pressed on with so much vigor and gadantry that they were not long held in check. At Cotton creek the Second Massachusetts hght battery opened fire, and for a few moments the combat seemed severe. Tho confederates lost a few men in that skirmish. On the north bank of Canoe creek the ground rose to a height of two hun dred feet, and afforded an advantageous position to the con federates, if it had been advisable to make a firm stand. From there they fed back to Pringle's creek, distant about four mdes. COMBAT OF PRINGLE'S CREEK. Pringle's creek was a shadow stream, skirted with shrubbery. Its north bank rose graduady fifty feet, and was covered with a characteristic growth of pine. On the brow of that crest was a high fence of spht rads, and a few hard-wood trees with heavy foliage. After crossing the ford, the road bore round to the right, making a gradual ascent of the hdl, and was much obscured by the trees. Three hundred yards above the ford was Pritchard's smad grist-mill, and above that a few acres were covered with a mid-pond. A mde below there was the smad vidage of Bluff Spring. Ai-riving at this creek, Col. Bad, to save his command, turned off rapidly toward Williams' station, leaving a picket on the road. He did not suppose Clanton's brigade would again offer battle, and both he and Col. Armistead, who was with him, deemed Pringle's creek a poor position. This left only"], [121, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 109 Clanton's brigade in the immediate front of Lucas. The bri gade consisted of two Alabama cavalry regiments, or battahons, under command of Col. Leary and Maj. Faulkner, not exceed ing five hundred men ; and attached to it also were two pieces of artidery, and one hundred infantry reserves, which remained on the north bank of the Escambia. Gen. Clanton had not yet arrived from Podard, and his brigade was under command of Col. Leary. The latter made a breastwork of fence-rads on the rise north of Pringle's creek, and behind it again formed his men. Immediately in their rear was an extensive field, wooded on both sides; and had a mile back of them their horses were tied, in a thick grove of hard wood, near some old log buddings which had been used for soldiers' quarters. A sharp engagement ensued as soon as Lucas' advance came up. The confederates were driven back two hundred yards in ten minutes, and were stdl fading back as Gen. Clanton gadoped up and ordered a halt. At this Col. Leary seemed surprised, and told Clanton they were being flanked. Clanton replied: \"But we must fad back in order.\" The latter then commanded his forces to dress up on the colors. His braAre color-bearer, young Maynor, held the colors high, and repeated the command, \"Dress up on the colors.\" Fifteen minutes after- ward Clanton fed severely, and it was then thought mortady, wounded. Immediately the buglers of the First Louisiana sounded the cad for the charge, and that regiment mounted and led by its commander, Lieut.-Col. A. S. Badger, dashed forward in line of battle, in a gadant, impetuous manner, and with a wdd and thrilling cheer. They were met by a vodey ; and though some of their number fed, the fury of the charge was not checked ; and in a few moments they had swept over and captured the main part of the confederate force. The prisoners consisted of Gen. Clanton, ten other officers, and one hundred and twenty enlisted men. The killed and wounded"], [122, "110 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. numbered about a dozen. A battle-flag was captured- by Private Thomas Edey. A number of horses and mules were also captured. The loss of the Fust Louisiana was two killed\u2014 First Lieut. Albert Schaffer and a bugler who fed in the charge\u2014 and eight wounded. Maj. J. E. Cowan of that regi ment received a severe and painful injury to his leg by coming in contact with a horse. In this action the Second New York attacked the confederates on their flank. The remainder of Clanton's command, a few who were mounted, were pursued to the Escambia, where, not knowing that the bridge was torn up from the centre, they leaped into the swoden and powerful stream, and escaped to the opposite shore or were drowned. The others fled into the swamp3. Lucas had a running fight ad the way to the Escambia. The two pieces of artidery and reserves from the north bank of that river produced an effect greater than their force justified ; such is the moral power of artidery. They were replied to by four pieces of the Second Massachusetts, under Lieut. Greenleaf, and in an hour compeded to retire. The Second division headquarters, with Spiceley's brigade of that division, at one o'clock, had ascended the long hill north of Canoe creek and gone into camp. Just then a despatch from Col. Whittelsey, chief of staff to Gen. Steele, was received stating that it would be prudent to send forward a brigade and some artidery to support Lucas. The commander of the division then with Spiceley's brigade and a section of each of the hght batteries hastened forward. Just beyond Pringle's creek the prisoners were received and taken charge of by the provost guard of the Second division. The detachment arrived at the Escambia at four in the after noon, and only a short time after the cavahy, having marched seventeen mdes. The banks of the Escambia being greatly overflowed, and it being essential to cross it, detads from Spiceley's brigade set to work constructing a foot bridge on the"], [123, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 111 radroad trestle which crossed the river a few rods below the destroyed bridge. But before the infantry had arrived Lucas had sent over two companies of the Thirty-first Massachusetts* dismounted, as pickets. The road had required considerable labor in order to bring the train along, and the remainder of the infantry that day got only to Cotton creek. Near the Escambia the road crossed marshes several hundred yards in extent, and much of the way covered with ponds of water. Through these it was perilous to ride and tedious to march afoot. The detads that worked on the bridge had to pass through such places. It was with much difficulty that the artillery was got through. Information of the fight at Pringle's creek and its result was received at Mobde the same day.1 Entry of Pollard. \u2014 In pursuance of Gen. Steele's orders, Spiceley's brigade of the Second divison, marched for Podard at daylight, the 26th. It was also accompanied by the division commander and staff. Infantry were sent, because cavalry could not yet cross the river. Ad went a-foot ; and having crossed over on the radroad trestle in single file, descended as best they could, some fifteen feet upon the marshy and overflowed bank. Thence, for some distance, the way lay through swampy places, which had to be waded. The httle Escambia was bridged in a short time. On its opposite bank some confederate scouts were seen, and two or three shots were fired. The road showed tracks of the artillery, which the con federates had used the day before, and the federals not yet having any certain knowledge of what was in Podard, thought 1 Gen. Lidell to Col. Spence: \"March 25. \u2014 Gen. Clanton was wounded, and with Col. Lary, Major Wharton, and the greater part of the brigade, were cap tured to-day near Bluff Springs. Col. Armistead and Col. Ball, not with them in the fight, still safe and in front of the enemy. That column of the enemy have a large wagon train and are moving for Montgomery.\""], [124, "112 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. it possible they might there meet with resistance. Preparations were accordingly made for such an emergency. But no armed confederates could be found, and the vidage was peaceably taken possession of. It was a smad village, having, perhaps, twenty dwellings, rude and much scattered. There were two or three wooden storehouses, used by the confederates, but there was no property, save a barrel or two of hard-bread. The pubhc storehouses, and only those, were burned. A thousand yards of radroad was torn up by the Twenty fourth Indiana, for the moral effect, but the bridges were not harmed, for it was thought they would soon be useful to the federals. Spiceley's brigade, it wid be remembered, consisted of two Indiana regiments \u2014 the Twenty-fourth and Sixty-ninth \u2014 and two Illinois regiments \u2014 the Sixty-seventh and Seventy-sixth \u2014 and it was in fine condition. It had two remarkably good brass bands ; and when the brigade marched away from the vidage, these bands struck up their inspiring strains. It ap peared as if the whole population of the vidage, consisting prin cipady of women and chddren, were fodowing the soldiers away. They walked along by their side, talking with them with the utmost good humor. As the brigade was leaving the place, some of the cavahy foragers entered, they having effected a crossing of the Escam bia some distance above the railroad bridge. The infantry returned to their camp, south of the Escambia, at four in the afternoon. The Eighty-third Ohio had come up and crossed the Escambia, to be in readiness as a reserve. Spnrling's Operations.\u2014 On the morning of the 19th, Lieut.- Col. A. B. Spurling, Second Maine cavahy, began to move from Barrancas on transports, Avith a force of eight hundred mounted men, Avith instructions to cut the railroad above Podard. He had an experienced and excedent command, consisting of the"], [125, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 113 mounted force of the three fodoAving regiments : the Second Maine, Major C. A. Miller ; the Second Illinois, Major Frank Moore ; the First Florida, Capt. Francis Lyons. Two compa nies under Capt. E. D. Johnson, Second Maine cavalry, were landed at Mdton, and moved out toward Podard, to drive away any confederate scouts that might be there, and to create the impression that the whole force would land there. By three, A. m., of the 20th, Spurling had landed his force on the east shore of the Blackwater, three mdes below, and opposite Milton, and marched for the radroad, via Andalusia. Confederate scouts were frequently met, and few escaped capture. The night of the 23d, from eleven to one o'clock, the column halted to rest, a few mdes out from Evergreen. Capture of a Staff Officer. \u2014 Soon after the column halted, Col. Spurling rode forward to his advance, and had scarcely arrived there when he heard talking in front. Dismounting quickly, he cautioned the men to be on the alert. He then stepped forward a few paces, and satisfied himsed there were men approaching. Then he crouched down beside the fence, to let them pass. There were three ; and as soon as they had got by, Spurling jumped in their rear and commanded them to surrender. They demanded to know who he was. Spurling replied, \" I am a hve Yankee.\" At that, the confederates raised their rifles on him, and Spurhng as qiuckly commenced firing on them with a re- volver, wounding two and capturing the three. They proved to to be Lieut. Watts, of Gen. Clanton's staff, and two scouts. By this, Spurling prevented alarm being given of his approach, and at three o'clock on the morning of the 24th he cut the rail- road seven mdes above Evergreen, and captured an up and a down train of cars, one train being loaded with confederate troops, whom he took prisoners. Having destroyed consider able radroad track and roding stock, he came down, via Sparta, bringing his prisoners mounted on captured horses. At Sparta, 8"], [126, "114 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. he burned six more cars, and the depot containing public stores, which had been sent from Podard for safe keeping. The morning of the 26th, attempting to cross the bridge over Murder creek, it was found to be partly destroyed, and a smad confederate force was posted on the opposite side, behind a strong barricade of logs ; but it was dislodged and driven off by a detachment of the Second Hlinois and Second Maine dismounted. Lieut. Vose and one man of the Second Maine cavahy were wounded. The bridge was then repaired and crossed. Col. Spurling's command arrived at Podard on the 26th, only a short time after Spiceley's brigade had left, and joined Steele's column the morning of the 27th, he having accomphshed the object of his expedition in a brdhant manner, and without the loss of a man. Steele turns toward Blakely. \u2014 The evening of the 26th, Steele caded his division commanders together, and notified them the column would turn the next morning to join Canby. There were now but four days' rations on hand, and the country was remarkably destitute. It was but httle else than a wdderness. The men were therefore put on had-rations. They having been exposed to wet weather and heavy fatigue the five days' rations they carried had not lasted the fud time, as to ad the men. But there were some who had been saving, and were stid fairly pro vided. A large number were without anything, and were expecting a new issue when they received orders to go on had rations. Early on the morning of the 27th, the column turned and marched westerly, toward Canoe station, on the Mobde and Montgomery radroad. Unfortunately, the route had not been previously examined and repaired. The cavalry moved out first, followed by Hawkins' division; but in attempting to get the wagons along, it was found, that the first two mdes of the road needed to be corduroyed. This prevented the rear of the Second division from starting tid noon. The prisoners being"], [127, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 115 in charge of that division, those of them who were wounded were carried carefully on stretchers to the neighboring houses. Gen. Clanton was thus carried, for a ball had passed quite through his body, and he was supposed to be mortally wounded. But he recovered. Spurling's prisoners, upward of a hundred, were turned over to Capt. Garretson, provost marshal of the Second division. Spurling's men had supplied themselves plentifudy with tobacco, which they distributed generously among the other troops. The confederates appear to have restored their telegraph communication on the Montgomery road in four days after it was cut. Col. Had, after leaving Pringle's creek, passed round thirty miles up to Hodins' bridge, and the next night (Sunday, the 26th) swam the Escambia, then proceeded to Bedvdle, and thence to Evergreen. Col. Armistead remained at Bedvdle, and from there, on the 30th, telegraphed Gen. Lided of the occupa tion of Podard by the federals on the 26th, and Canoe station the 27th.1 The distance to Canoe station, on the route the column moved, was thirteen mdes. After passing the bad road near the Escambia, the country was hilly, and it seemed that there would be but slight trouble in getting the wagons along. But the rain commenced falling soon after noon, dissolving the earth's treacherous surface. The main part of the column reached Canoe station in good season. But Spiceley's brigade with the train of the Second division had to bivouac near Mdes', four miles from Canoe station. The artillery got a httle farther. The night was intensely dark, the rain was coming down in torrents. The prospect was dismal. 1 Lidell to Maury : \" March 31. \u2014 Col. Armistead telegraphs from Bellville via Greenville, 30th, that the enemy were in force at Pollard Sunday morning, and reported to have occupied Canoe station Monday. He heard the enemy would turn toward Tensas and Blakely.\""], [128, "116 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. The 28th, the weather was pleasant overhead. The Second division worked from daylight tid eleven, A. M., and corduroyed the road nearly the whole way from Mdes' to Canoe station \u2014 four miles \u2014 in order to get up the train and artdlery. The cavalry and Hawkins' division had moved on. The Second division train was ad up to Canoe station by one o'clock. A rest was then taken of two hours. Rations were then issued for five thousand one hundred and seventy-nine men, the number of enhsted men of the two brigades present, and for two hundred and thirty-six prisoners. At three, p. M., the march was re sumed in a northwesterly direction. The troops moved out in good spirits and handsome style, the music playing. Five mdes were made by dusk, when they again went into camp on an abandoned plantation. Gen. Steele with the rest of the column camped about five mdes beyond. The march was resumed at dayhght, the 29th, by the Second division ; but the roads were bad, and had to be corduroyed much of the way. The camp of Hawkins' division was passed at eleven o'clock. From there to the Perdido was three mdes, and, heavy rain falling in the afternoon, that distance also had to be corduroyed. At dusk the column camped near the Perdido. The cavahy moved on to Weatherford's plantation. For the past three days cannonading had been heard in the direction of Spanish fort ; and there was a rumor that the federals had assaulted and been repulsed \u2014 badly repulsed, of course, for the rumors of the camp are seldom moderate. Gen. Steele having sent some scouts with despatches to Gen. Canby, they were observed by the confederates at Bay Minette station.1 1 Lidell to Holtzclaw, \" commanding advance :\" \" March 29 Capt. Winston has just reported the advance of the enemy, consisting of between fifty and one hundred cavalry, was at Bay Minette station this afternoon, at three o'clock.\""], [129, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 117 The morning of the 30th was raw and windy, and the sol diers were seen in thick circles around the camp-fires. The colored division moved out first, and was fodowed by the Second at nine o'clock. The Perdido, where forded, was two feet deep, and some trees were feded, on which the soldiers crossed. To get the artidery along, the Second division made two mdes more of corduroy, and made it promptly. Consider able work had to be done also on the road near McGdls. Then the division marched two miles farther, making nine from the Perdido, and, at dusk, went into camp in the woods, on high ground, just beyond a clear stream. The cavahy and Hawkins' division had got a few mdes beyond. Toward evening, the foragers, who had been to Montgomery Hid, brought in some beef cattle and sheep, which were greatly needed. The troops were on third rations, and the majority were suffering with hunger. The labor and exposure were enough to reduce men who were wed fed. As it was, the effects of the hardships of the march, and the scanty fare, could be discerned, day by day, in the reduced flesh of the sol diers. There was, perhaps, a day's ration stdl in the train. It was singular to perceive so much difference in the economy and husbandry of men. While some would be living on parched corn, a few would have haversacks stdl plump, and well furnished with bacon and hard bread, coffee and sugar.1 At dayhght on the 31st, the Second division resumed the march, making Stockton, nineteen mdes, by two o'clock. The whole column arrived there about that time. For a few mdes before reaching Stockton the country was more settled and 1 \" Tired, wet, muddy, and hungry. Our snpper consisted to-night of sassa fras tea and parched corn, Avhich we had picked up from the ground where our cavalry had fed.\" \u2014 Diary of a Private Soldier, March 30. \" Rations very scarce, and forage also. The prisoners are very hungry, but say we are doing the best we can with them.\" \u2014 Diary of another Enlisted Man, March 31."], [130, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 118 fertile ; and though hidy, the road was fad. It was indeed a luxury to come out upon a road that did not need corduroying. The ration question began there to assume a pleasanter shape. 1 There was plenty of fresh meat. Considerable corn was also found, and a grist-mid there was kept running whde the troops remained. The troorjs having supplied themselves with corn from the neighboring plantations, the march was resumed the forenoon of Aprd 1. The Second division was in the rear, and its last files left Stockton at noon. The road being hard, though hidy, Steele with the cavahy and Hawkins division pushed on to within two mdes of Blakely. A regiment of Pde's brigade was detached to guard the Hodyoak bridge, but returned the next day. Capture of an Outpost. \u2014 Lieut.-Col. Spurling stdl retaining his command, was sent forward from Stockton in advance to open communication with Gen. Canby, Arriving within six mdes of Blakely he encountered confederate scouts, several of whom he captured, and pursued the remainder closely two mdes, when he came upon a stronger force, consisting of the Forty-ninth Mississippi, near Wdkins' plantation, posted behind a barricade of fence-rads three tier deep. Spurling then caused the Second Maine to dismount to attack on foot, leaving the First Florida as a reserve and as a guard for the horses. He then disposed the Second Illinois with sabres drawn in rear of the Second Maine, who were already skirmishing briskly, and steadily advancing. The confederates observed the bullets of the Second Maine to rattle faster and harder on their rad barricade, and discerning the glittering sabres of the Second Illi nois farther back they soon gave way. Then Spurling ordered 1 \" Marched nineteen miles to-day. Have no bread or coffee, but plenty of pork, beef, and mutton. Drew one cracker a piece to-night.\"\u2014 Diary of a Private Soldier, March 31."], [131, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 119 the Second Illinois to charge, which it did in gadant style, and captured the main part of the outpost before it could rady behind its second line of works. The Second Maine fodoAved as soon as it could mount. About one hundred of the Forty ninth Mississippi were captured, with its colors and arms. Spurling's loss was one kdled and three wounded. About the same time the confederate outpost at O. Sibley's was withdrawn and the bridge set on fire.1 Lucas, having learned the locality of the bridge, by permission, sent the Second Illinois cavalry, under Lieut.-Col. Moore, to hold it, and the latter arrived in season to save it. Lucas' cavahy also reconnoitered the position of Blakely and drew the fire of its artidery. One of the cavalry-men was killed within a thousand yards of the principal redoubt on the Stockton road ; and was aftenvard buried by men of the Second division. The cavalry also charged on an outpost on Saluda hid, and the confederates having radied a skirmish ensued in which there were one or two killed and wounded on both sides. During the day the cavalry lost a few men and horses by the explosion of torpedoes. Here, then, before Blakely, moving Avith rapid and defiant step, was the column which, a few days before, was supposed to be inextricably stuck in . the Florida SAvamps. It is not 1 Capt. Lewis to the colonel commanding infantry at Sibley's house : \"March 31.\u2014 The enemy is about fifteen miles distant near the railroad above us, and will probably advance to-morrow morning ; in view of which Gen.

You will direct the officer in charge of the squad with sub-terra shells to plant them at once, except in the road, where they will not be placed until the last moment, leaving a ' vidette ' in the road, to inform any of our men coming in of the necessity of keeping in the middle of the road. It is necessary for you to concentrate your command in order to be ready to move to the works \u2014 Avith the artillery \u2014 or resist the enemy where you are should he come in your front and not from above. You will also burn the Sibley bridge should he be able to drive you from the creek.\""], [132, "120 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE strange that the commanding general at Blakely apprehended an assault.1 From Stockton to the raihoad, crossing at Hall's, the distance is fourteen mdes. The Second division reached that place just before dark, and received orders, which had been left by Gen. Steele, to destroy the radroad. Spiceley's brigade having got in first, the TAventy-fourth Indiana was set to that duty, and effectively destroyed four hundred yards of track in an hour. Veatch's Movement with Supplies. \u2014 On the 31st of March, Gen. Canby started a train of seventy-five wagons of supplies to Steele. The train was in charge of Veatch's division, which moved out from near Spanish fort at eight in the morning, arriving at Hodyoak at noon, where it intrenched. The next day, Aprd 1, a detachment of one hundred of the Fourth Ten nessee cavalry, under Lieut.-Col. Thombury, reported to Veatch, and Maj. McEntee, Steele's chief quartermaster, also came up from Canby's headquarters. Veatch marched again at three, p. m. At six, p. m., he heard firing toward Blakely. The column halted, and a squadron of cavahy, supported by two regiments of infantry and a section of artillery, marched three mdes farther toward Blakely, when, everything becoming quiet, and it being very dark, they returned to the division-camp. The supplies were got to Steele the next night. 1 Lidell to Maury: \"April 1.\u2014 In view of the fact that Steele with his negroes may assault our works please send me one hundred and fifty small arms to place in the hands of all surplus artillerists.\""], [133, "CHAPTER XV. INVESTMENT AND SIEGE OF BLAKELY. Blakely is situated ten mdes northeast from Mobile, on the east bank of the Appalachee river, and opposite its confluence with the Tensas. The extent and depth of its adjacent waters make it a fine natural port. On the old maps it appears as a place of importance, and forty years ago it had a population of three thousand ; but the landowners held their property at such high prices its growth was checked, and the people soon took down their buddings and moved with them to Mobde. At the time of the war, Blakely, although a county-seat, had a popula- tion not exceeding a hundred. Its front of dry ground, on the river, is a mile and a half in extent, and this character of soil Avidens on going from the river ; but on each side of it is low, swampy ground, densely covered with hard-wood timber and a rank growth of weeds and vines. The sod is sandy. Near the river are several large and ancient live-oaks bountifudj' festooned with moss. Approaching the place from the river, it seems nearly covered with a growth of natural forest, yet some old and culti- vated openings can be seen. Five hunched yards above the landing is a brick-yard, and near that a spur of ground fifty feet higher than the water approaches to the river, upon which a smad stockade fort was first budt. Then some had a mde from that, on a plateau of equal elevation, was an incomplete bastion-fort, of red earth. Two hundred yards from the landing, almost secluded by the drooping branches of hve-oaks, is the court house \u2014 a smad two-story brick budding, painted white, and"], [134, "122 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. having in its basement a room answering the purpose of a jail. In sight, also, are four or five old wooden buddings. From the vicinity of the landing two principal roads diverge, one bearing northeast to Stockton, the other southeast to Pensa cola. For a mde they run about parallel. They are both gravedy roads, much worn and washed. Pursuing the Stock ton road, it was one mile from the landing to the line of eon federate fortifications. The Pensacola road winds around on high ground. On this road were the ruins of some cottages and a variety of shrub bery and evergreens. For a mde back from the landing the ground has a general rise tdl it reaches the line of breastworks, where it is about sixty feet above the water level. The surface is uneven, and there are many deds thickly wooded with magnolias, beeches, pines, and other trees, and abounding with clear springs and streams. These are its attractive features. The fortifications were constructed in a sort of semicircle around Blakely ; resting on a bluff close to the river, at the extreme left, and terminating with the high ground, a few rods from the river, on the right. The line was nearly three miles in length, and included nine well-built redoubts \u2014 or lunettes. The fortifications were thoroughly built, and were armed with about forty pieces of artillery. But the ditches were not more than four or five feet deep. From six to eight hundred yards all along the front the trees had been felled \u2014 pines on the high ground and hard-wood trees in the ravines. Fifty yards out from the works was a line of abatis, and opposite some of the redoubts was an interior line. Then three hundred yards out to the front, parallel with the works, was another line of abatis, and behind the latter were detached rifle-pits. The garrison of Blakely consisted of French's division \u2014 then commanded by Gen. Cockrell \u2014 as the left wing, its right extend-"], [135, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 123 ing a httle below the redoubt south of the Stockton road. Tho troops of that division were veterans, mostly from Missouri and Mississippi. The right wing consisted of Gen. Thomas' di vision of Alabama reserves. There were several artidery com panies to man the guns. The whole garrison numbered about three thousand five hundred, and was under the command of Gen. St. John Lided. On the 1st of April, Lided instructed Cockred to make a dash on Steele, d he deemed it advisable, and cautioned him, d he did so, to use \" a smad but rehable force.\" Cockred was also directed to fid the skirmish pits on the entire line with men from his division, for the reason, as it appears, they were con sidered more experienced and rehable than the reserves. But, after consultation with Cockred, this plan was abandoned, and Thomas was instructed to supply the advance pits in his front with his OAvn men. INVESTMENT OF BLAKELY. The bivouac of the colored division was in plain hearing of the guns at Spanish fort, but to the most of those men the sound of artillery was not new. The men had lain down, each with his gun beside him, the night of the 1st, in a sober mood, and rose the next morning in similar spirits, for they were yet on slender rations of parched corn. Heavy firing on the picket line brought them into hne of battle early on Sunday morning, the 2d. But before they had moved out, the quartermaster's wagons went round with com, and two ears and a \" nubbin\" were dealt out to each man as rations, producing much mer riment. Drew's brigade was in the advance, and the picket from the Sixty-eighth regiment, under Lieut. Taisey, was down on the Stockton road. When morning broke, the lieutenant could see nothing of confederates in his front, and, after consulting the"], [136, "124 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. officer of the cavalry detachment with him, they concluded to venture out for a reconnoissance. They proceeded without in terruption for some distance, and began to think they would find the way unimpeded into Blakely, when suddenly, from a clump of trees near the edge of the slashings, they were met with a handsome vodey. The firing soon grew brisk, and the confede rate artidery caused them to fad back. Then Hawkins moved his division out to close in on Blakely, marching obhquely to the right from the Stockton road, through a pine forest, with skirmishers deployed. The troops felt that they would encounter a veteran foe in his intrenchments, but that reflection neither lessened the firmness of their step, nor the ardor of their resolution. Not a man lagged, but with eager strides to the front, they kept the horses of the mounted officers on the trot. In the midst of shot, shed, and budets, they had to cross an abrupt, deep, broken ravine, made doubly difficult, by a dense tangle of undergrowth. The regimental commanders feared that they would come out of it a confused throng. The company officers emerged, took their respective distances, stdl moving forward, and the line quickly fided up, and swept along as eagerly and codectedly as if no obstruction had been met. The first earnest resistance encountered was about a mde and a quarter in front of the confederate left, at a stream which runs northwest, through a deep and narrow ravine, and near where it debouches into a Avooded swamp. The skirmish line then consisted of six companies from each of the three brigades. Col. J. B. Jones of the Sixtv-eighth regiment, was put in charge of it, and the main line halted. A severely-contested skhmish combat then took place on ground which became the extreme right of the Federal line of investment. The confederates hung along the brow and slopes of the bluff bordering on the swamp, and Col. Jones found it no easy matter to dislodge them. They were using their artidery vigorously from the redoubts, and a"], [137, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 125 number of the colored division had fallen. Three more com panies from each brigade were sent to reinforce the skhmish line so that it finally comprised twenty-seven companies. In course of three hours the confederates were driven back about eight hundred yards. Col. Jones estabhshed his line in the slashings within one hundred and twenty yards of the confede rates' outer rifle-pits ; and it remained as the skirmish fine on the right during the siege. Hawkins' loss was about forty killed and wounded. Among the mortady wounded was Lieut. Ed ward E. Talbot, a gadant young officer belonging to the Sixty eighth. In the Forty-eighth, four were kdled and four wounded, including in the latter, Col. Crandad, struck by a shed. The major of the Ninety-seventh was shot in the foot. Col. Jones was conspicuous along the line for bravery and had two horses shot under him. At had-past eight o'clock, Lided telegraphed to Maury at Mobde, that he thought the Federals were preparing for an assault, and that skirmishing was then occurring. He also asked for additional artillery.1 The Second division marched from Hall's soon after day dght, and were some distance on the road before sunrise. As the soldiers ascended the high ground and looked off to the left, over the wooded deds, they could see through the hazy atmosphere that the eastern sky was stdl crimson. It was not long before firing was heard at the front. This hastened their pace, and they arrived before Blakely at ten o'clock. Steele, Hawkins, Lucas, and several other officers, were sit ting upon logs, by the Stockton road where it is crossed by 1 Gen. Lidell to Gen. Maury : \" Blakely, April 2, 8:30 a. m.\u2014 \"The enemy camped apparently in large force, one mile above us, last night, on the Stockton road, and is now engaged skirmishing on the left flank, preparing, I think, for an assault or demonstration in force. I need additional artillery, temporarily, if it can be spared.\""], [138, "126 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. the road from Sibley's, and about a mile from the Blakely breastworks ; and were discussing the information that had been brought from the front. The firing in Hawkins' front had abated somewhat, yet stdl continued. It had been Steele's intention to first strike Hollyoak, and wait orders. But the want of forage compeded him to go by the way of Stockton, which brought him close to Blakely. He therefore immediately wrote Canby what had aheady been accomplished before Blakely ; and he was soon after ward instructed to continue the investment. Hawkins' left then extended within two hundred yards of the Stockton road, but he had a strong picket in the bushes close to the road. The Second division was ordered to form on the left of Hawkins' division. It had been formed in the following order : The Third (Moore's) brigade in line of battle, it being in the advance ; and the Second (Spiceley's) in the rear, in the shade \u2014 for the rays of the sun were beating down oppressively \u2014 in column of division closed in mass. The Sec ond Connecticut light battery was in position on the left of the Stockton road, and the Fifteenth Massachusetts on the right. All the men in the division were resting. Then before advancing any of the troops the commanding officer of the division, with some other officers, went to the front to recon noitre. They bore off to the left of the Stockton road in the woods, and got within eight hundred yards of the main con federate works, and where they could wed survey the position. It was also seen that confederate sharpshooters were numer ously stationed in advanced rifle-pits. The party got within two hundred yards of some of these, but by cover of the trees, and quick dodging, they escaped being hit. Betuming to the line, the One Hundred and Fourteenth Ohio, under Col. Kedy, and the Twentieth Iowa, under Lieut.-Col. Leake, were ad vanced as skirmishers, and moved up on a line with the division"], [139, "127 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. on the right. The ground they passed over sloped a httle toward Blakely. It was covered with a thin and smad growth of pines where the One Hundred and Fourteenth Ohio passed, but where the Twentieth Iowa passed the timber was heavier. The movement could not be entirely concealed ; and the con federates opened a warm fire of artillery, but it occasioned no loss to either regiment. The skirmishers of that regiment be came engaged, and compeded the advanced line of confederates to take shelter in their regular line of rifle-pits. About noon, Maj. -Gen. Osterhaus, chief of staff to Gen. Canby, came up from Spanish fort, to take a view of the position. Later in the day, the Second division was directed to com plete the line of investment to Bay Minette, a distance of two mdes. Moore's brigade then took position on the left. The Twentieth Iowa and One Hundred and Fourteenth Ohio were withdrawn at five, P. M., and the line occupied by the Twenty fourth Indiana, LieuU-Col. Sears, in front of Spiceley's brigade, and the Thirty-fourth Iowa, Col. G. W. Clark, in front of Moore's brigade. These were large regiments \u2014 the Thirty fourth numbering seven hundred and forty-seven effective, and the Twenty-fourth numbering seven hundred and twenty-nine effective. Their deployed line, during the night, occupied about two mdes. Whde the Thirty-fourth Iowa was taking position, one of its men \u2014 Josiah Bobinson\u2014 was severely wounded in the face by a musket-bad, which shattered both of his jaws and tore out nearly ad of his teeth. During the evening, John Hudson, of the Twenty-fourth Indiana, was killed. The confederate commander observing troops moving south of the Stockton road, and even below the Pensacola road, was stdl more apprehensive of an assault.1 1 Lidell to Maury: \"April 2.\u2014 I believe the enemy are preparing to assault my line to-day. Please spare me some light artillery temporarily, and, if pos sible, send it over immediately.\""], [140, "128 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. The same afternoon the ground was further reconnoitred by officers of the Second division, and also by Gen. Comstock, chief engineer on the staff of Gen. Canby, who had come up from Spanish fort for that purpose. That night both divisions commenced intrenching one thou sand yards from the confederate works, but the spades were few for so long a line, and the progress was slow. At ten o'clock, the commanding officer of the Second division and Col. Spiceley were both on the skinnish line of the latter's brigade, and moved the skirmishers farther to the front, and pointed out where the pits should be dug. The musketry-firing seemed to be at close range. It was quite dark. There was a vehe ment fire of artillery, searching the Stockton road and the ravine ruuning paradel with, and a short distance south, of it. The frequent explosions of shells, like the flashes of lightning in a severe storm, tended to blind and bewilder one, d they did nothing worse. The confederate artiderists had been speciady instructed to maintain such a fire as would compel the federals to commence their intrenchments a considerable distance off. Their gunboats, on their left, also threw sheds of large calibre. At eleven o'clock, the commanding officer of the Second division, with some of the staff and the Pioneer corps, the latter having spades, started to find the advanced line of the Third brigade, expecting to strike some part of the main line of that brigade on the way. The party crossed the brook, which runs over the Stockton road near the confederate works, at a point three quarters of a mde from those works, and near where the Second division headquarters afterward were fixed. They then passed down on the left of that brook, confident of at least striking the rear of the Third brigade skhmish line ; but having gone fudy as far to the front as they expected that line was, they halted. An aide then walked forward a few rods in the darkness, but was fired on sharply with musketry, the bads coming in the"], [141, "129 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. direction of the party, and from only a very short distance off. It seemed then that the fire must be from the confederates, and no explanation was sought for in that position ; but the party withdrew and made a new start, succeeding better the second time, yet finding the Third brigade farther to the left than was expected. The aide contended that the firing was from the skirmishers of the Third brigade, and that the party had got upon their flank. It may have been so, and undoubtedly the result would have been different but for the darkness, the rough ness of the ground, and the thickness of the shrubbery with which it was covered. The occurrence is mentioned to show the difficulties of operations in the night on strange ground ; how surprises and accidents wdl obstruct the best intentions, and how important it is that orders shad be specific, and lines kept wed closed. 9"], [142, "CHAPTER XVI. SIEGE OF SPANISH FORT\u2014 SEVENTH AND EIGHTH DAYS. April 2. \u2014 Sunday morning opened clear and mild, yet gave no pause to the roar of artillery and the screeching of sheds. Before the sun rose, some shots were distinguished in the direction of Blakely, which very soon increased to a frdl volume of continued musketry and booming of field guns. The usual Sunday morning inspection was observed at eight o'clock by those of the besiegers not on duty ; the drum-beat ad along the line, gave the signals ; and afterward were heard the cheering strains of the brass bands. When the garrison artillerists could do so, they were disposed to blend with this agreeable music the explosion of a shed. The two left sections of Mack's Eighteenth New York battery \u2014 four twenty-pounder rifles \u2014 opened in the morning, in Gran ger's front, four hundred and fifty yards from McDermett. Capt. Mack noticed that it was the eighth Sunday his battery had been in action. The sections were under the immediate command of Lieuts. Widiams and McConnel. The firing was exceedingly dvely and accurate ; and was ably answered by the guns under Captain Barnes. Solid shot and sheds literady haded around Mack's battery, and many of his command escaped narrowly. But they ad stood up to their work without the quiver of a hp. About eleven, Slocum's Washington artil lery came to the assistance of Fort McDermett, for the latter was receiving some heavy blows also from the First Indiana eight-inch mortars, and the Massachusetts hght guns on Mack's"], [143, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 131 left and rear. The Washington artillery almost enfiladed Mack's position, and hurled their hideous projectdes at him from eleven o'clock tid one in the afternoon. Having no guns to bear on them \u2014 they being too far to his right he could only increase the intensity of his fire on the guns in his immediate front. He dismounted their twenty-four-pounder howitzer, and before noon their guns were ad sdent. But at four, p. M., .they opened on him again, save the twenty-four-pounder. He re turned the fire. The Washington artidery again set on him, and the combat continued tid dark. His works had been struck thirty-eight times, during the day ; but none of his #command were killed or wounded. Most of the ensuing night was spent by his men, repairing the injury to his works.1 Fort McDermett had suffered the most. Its parapet had been defaced, and an VIH-inch mortar shed from Lieut. Baper's section of the First Indiana, had dropped on the carriage of its Brooks' rifle, and completely disabled it. On the extreme right of the Sixteenth corps, Capt. S. F. Craig's battery, A, Sixth Michigan heavy artillery, had four X-inch mortars in position, behind a ridge two hundred yards from the garrison works ; from which he had a fair enfilading range. Farther to the right Wimmer's and Cox's thirty-pounders, and the other guns commanding Huger and Tracy maintained a steady fire. Blankenship's four VIH-inch mortars of the First Indiana, began to fire at six o'clock in the morning, threw one hundred shells at Bed fort, and then, his ammunition being a dttle short, he ceased tid night. In Granger's front batteries, No. 2 and No. 5, for heavy guns, 1 \" The night after this the confederate sharpshooters called out to those in Mack's front, and inquired what battery it was, and on being informed, replied humorously, that they wished it might be taken away."], [144, "132 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. were finished, and No. 6 commenced. In the evening, the Eighty-first Illinois, Lieut.-Col. Bogers, was relieved from duty at Minette bayou, and took position on Carr's extreme right, and extended rifle-pits toward the bay, on a hue with the ad vance Avorks of the rest of its brigade, now less than tvvo hun dred yards from the garrison breastworks. In the Third division, Sixteenth corps, the casualties were only eight kdled and wounded, including Capt. C. G. Stetson, of the Thirty-third Wisconsin, who was instantly kdled by a confederate sharpshooter, whde superintending the construc tion of the advance line of works. In the First division, Six teenth corps, the casualties were only four. The Navy. \u2014 The Octorara had, on the 31st, taken her two IX inch guns aboard, but in the afternoon grounded on the west bank of the channel. About noon of the 2d, she opened fire on the confederate transport Jeff. Davis, then standing dovrai the river for the landing at Spanish fort, and succeeded in striking her once, when she turned and steamed up the river, out of range. After this, transports did not venture to Spanish fort in the daytime.

Three vessels had now been destroyed, and a number of lives lost, in consequence of the thickly-strewn torpedoes. To remove these hidden perds, and open a passage for the squadron up the channel, detads of officers and seamen kept steaddy and fear lessly at work. In these duties the Metacomet, Commander Pierce Crosby, appears to have taken the lead. The process of sweeping for torpedoes was performed in boats, by pahs, each one taking the end of a line, to the centre of which were attached light weights, and smad ropes in loops, so they might attach themselves to anything brought in con tact with them upon the bottom. The boats separated a short"], [145, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 133 distance, and then pulled in paradel lines up or down the chan nel, dragging the line with its centre upon the bottom. Many torpedoes were thus taken up. When one was taken, it was dragged upon the marsh and pierced with a rifle-bad or auger, to admit water to drown the charge. Admiral Thatcher concluded to adopt additional means to clear the channel, in the nature of nets to intercept floating torpedoes ; and on the night of the 3d, the boats of the Octo rara, with a smad boat from the ironclad Chickasaw, got the first net across the river, from the wreck of the Milwaukie to the flat on the east side of the channel. Operations of the Army. \u2014 The four X-inch mortars of Com pany K, Sixth Michigan heavy artillery, Lieut. Edward C. Beardsley in temporary command of the company, came up on the night of the 1st of April, and the mortars were set in the rifle-pits tid suitable works could be constructed. Their position was close to the edge of the bluff, four hundred and fifty yards from McDermett, and about the same distance to the left of Mack's twenty-pounder battery. But between the first and second sections of the Sixth Michigan mortars, was a battery of four VIH-inch howitzers of the First Indiana Avhich took posi tion there this day. Lieut. Beardsley's first section opened in the afternoon in a satisfactory manner in presence of Gen. Granger and several other officers, the first two shells being dropped directly on the top of the parapet of McDermett. Mack's twenty-pounders worried the garrison at clifferent times during the day, but the guns of the latter in his front continued sdent ; thed' mortars, hoAvever, shelled him consider ably. At three, p. m., the Washington artidery on his right again commenced on him throwing shells incessantly to a quarter to five, p. M. His works were struck nine times, but no serious damage was done. In the front of Gen. A. J. Smith's corps two of the hght guns"], [146, "134 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. of the Fourteenth Indiana battery were taken out of position, and two thirty-pounder Parrots of Hendrick's battery (L, Fust Indiana heavy artillery), under Lieuts. Clary and Benson, were put in their place. But the construction of platforms was re tarded by the garrison's sharpshooters. Blankenship's battery (B, First Indiana) had been engaged through the night in throwing sheds into the garrison to dis turb its slumbers. These were thrown at half-hour intervals . and during the night and day his men fired one hundred and twenty-seven rounds. Whde a number of these Indiana men were standing round their camp-fire, a shed from the garrison came over and fell in the fire. The men escaped injury by quickly dropping upon the ground and rolling down the lull. The thirty-pounders (Batteries H and K, First Indiana) on Bay Minette shore were stid engaged actively in drawing the atten tion of Fort Huger from the besiegers' flank, and fired day and night. During the day three men of Battery H were wounded \u2014 J. S. Holt by a piece of shed seriously, and Gray and Newman by sphnter shght. In the Thirteenth corps front Battery No. 6 was finished and occupied by two thirty-pounders of the First Indiana Bat tery (M). Near the extreme left Capt. Bough advanced his VIH-inch howitzer two hundred yards nearer McDermett. Four cohorn mortars were put in position under direction of Lieut. Sibert, First Indiana. An incident occurred in the front of Marshad's brigade which well illustrates both the soldier's daring and magnanimity. Whde the Seventh Minnesota was on duty in the advance trench in the daytime, a bird came and ht some yards in front and between their line and the confederates. Many shots were fired at the bird, and it soon dropped to the ground. At this Private Wm. Bowe of Capt. Buck's Company D, jumped up"], [147, ""], [148, "Bomb-proofs\u2014 Inside Besiegers' First Parallel (Sixteenth Corps Front,) \u2014 Spanish Fort."], [149, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 135 over the works and ran out in plain sight of the confederates, picked up the bird and returned unmolested to his place in the trench. The tod of the besiegers was incessant and severe. They now had only three divisions and one brigade engaged in the siege. The second paradel had been opened ; in some places the third ; approaches or saps dug and heavy batteries from day to day being constructed. It was by no means smooth work; for in some places the ground was rocky, in others it was fided with stumps and roots, and covered with large logs. The detads had become so wearing on the men that the officers sometimes took the musket and went on duty themselves as sharpshooters whde the men rested and slept. Besides the works already referred to, the besiegers had in rear of their first or outer line construct ed bomb-proof quarters. For the most part these were regular and sunk in the earth. The pits would hold from three to eight men, and so arranged, of course, that the occupants could lie down. They were covered over with layers of logs, sometimes three thicknesses, over which Avere from one to four feet of earth, varying according to the exposure of their situation and the industry of the occupants. Among the besiegers the estimate of the strength of the garri son varied from three thousand to ten thousand. The garrison at first under-estimated the number of the besiegers, thinking they did not exceed ten thousand. The casualties in the garrison were this day reported to be eight killed and sixteen wounded. In Carr's division they were three kdled and nine wounded.1 1 \" Sunday, April 2 Huger and Tracy very vigorously shelled by the enemy's Bay Minette batteries which do some very fine practice.

This advanced line was only a hundred yards from the salient of the garrison, Battery No. 3. To fid the gap made by the withdrawal of Marshad, Col. Krez moved his brigade around to its proper position on Benson's left. The ground vacated by Krez was occupied by the Six teenth corps extending its left. The brigade of Col. Krez had met with some loss since the 28th in holding its exposed skirmish line. In the Twenty-eighth Wisconsin two had been kided and six wounded ; in the Twenty seventh Wisconsin one had been kided and six wounded ; in the Thirty-third Iowa one had been kided and four wounded. At this time the advance paradels of the besiegers were within a hundred yards of the different sadents of the garrison fortifications. The garrison had also extended counter ap proaches and rifle-pits so that the sharpshooters on both sides were within talking distance. Forts Huger and Tracy were strengthened by placing bags of sand on the parapets between the embrasures, the fided sand bags having been sent down the river in the night on flats.

In anticipation of the general bombardment that was to com mence at five, P. M., the besiegers' artdlery fired but little before that hour. The X-inch mortars of the Sixth Michigan, on the left, did not, however, entirely neglect McDermett ; and their fire was answered. A twenty-four-pounder shed exploded at the entrance of Lieut. Beardsley's magazine, but did no harm. Another shed struck among the men whde they were at dinner down under the bluff, wounding Corporal Perrin, and arousing an Irishman's apprehensions for the safety of the coffee. Capt. Blankenship's battery (B, First Indiana) fired twenty rounds per hour from each mortar from five, A. M., tid five, p. m. This battery was also disturbed at the dinner-hour. A shed came through the captain's tent and exploded, causing, in the excitement, the dinner to be upset, and \" all the queen' s-ware to be broken \u2014 which, however, was but one cup and saucer.\" The two twelve-pounders of Morse's Fourteenth Indiana, which had been withdrawn to give place to thirty-pounders, were put in position on the extreme right. Lieut. James (Battery I, First Indiana) arrived with detach ment, and reheved Lieut. Sibert, acting adjutant, in charge of the cohorn mortars. The guns of Bay Minette battery were engaged throughout the day. Capt. Foust having procured a fresh supply of ammunition, his battery of steel guns resumed its original position. During the day the garrison were quite annoying with their cohorn mortars, and troubled the infantry in their advanced pits exceedingly. The fire from smad mortars was troublesome on both sides. The Sixteenth corps had made a number of wooden mortars, which were also quite effective. Each mortar was made of a log about a foot in diameter, sixteen inches in length, and of cahbre for a four-inch shed.

The effec tive strength of the latter was sixty-seven. It was composed of northem-born men, and had participated in the prominent battles of the Southwest, from Shdoh to Nashville. The Bombardment. \u2014 At this date, the besiegers had in posi tion against Spanish fort, thirty-eight siege-guns (including six twenty-pounder rifles, and sixteen mortars), and thirty-seven field guns, ad of which (seventy-five), with the Minette bay battery, against Huger and Tracy, opened fire at five, p. M., and continued tid seven, p. m. The orders were for each gun to fire every three minutes. There was not much response, except from the guns of Old Spanish fort. It was a wed-sustained and grand bombardment. The garrison sought shelter in their bombproofs. Clouds of dust rose from their parapets. \"The earth,\" says a correspondent, \" actuady trembled from the effect of this mighty fire.\" Meanwhde, the sharpshooters, in the skirmish trenches or pits, kept up their accustomed filing. The signal had been given by Mack's battery, the Eighteenth New York. That battery fired three hundred and sixty rounds, and its works were hit seventeen times during the day. In the bombardment there was a premature explosion of one of its guns, which mortady wounded Aaron Vosberg, a most excedent and gallant young soldier. Two thirty-pounder Parrotts, of Capt. S. E.

Their fire was answered with great vehemence by the guns of Old Spanish fort ; and the sheds of the latter dropped thick and fast over the battery of Capt. Armstrong. Once there was a pause of ten or fifteen minutes in their fire, and the gunners of Battery M were congratulating themselves on the happy prospect that they had quit for the day, when they again opened with greater fury, nor ceased tdl after it was dark. The No. 1 X-inch mortar, of Company K, Sixth Michigan, exploded a caisson in McDermett, which produced a loud cheer among the besiegers. The first section of Hendrick's Battery (L, First Indiana), Lieuts. Clary and Benson, opened on Old Spanish fort and Bed fort, from Carr's left ; and the second section, Lieut. Parker, near McArthur's right, dismounted the columbiad in Bed fort . but, not knowing this at the time, the guns continued in the same range and destroyed the embrasure. During the bombardment, Blankenship's battery threw one hundred and sixty sheds inside the garrison works. Capt. Wimmer observed a transport, loaded with troops, approaching from above, but she did not come within range. When the bombardment was over, the men received a ration of whiskey ; the bands struck up patriotic airs ; and cheers echoed and re-echoed from one end of the line to the other. There was no enthusiasm, of course, in the garrison ; yet, a feehng of relief and satisfaction. Owing to the art of bomb proofs, they had been hurt less than could have been expected ; and they had been spared an assault. Gen. Lided congratu lated the garrison commander on his shght loss. l 1 Lidell to Gibson : \"April 4 Hope you will yet drive away tne Yankee devils, and am delighted that you have suffered so little.

April 5. \u2014 At this stage of the siege, mortar-sheds were thrown into the garrison throughout the night at regular intervals. A ten-inch mortar-shed is a fraction under ten inches in diameter, and weighs very nearly ninety pounds. An eight-inch shed is nearly eight inches in diameter, and weighs about fifty pounds. Some idea can be formed of the noise they produce in explod- ing. But although that was calculated to break the slumber of the garrison, what was most to be dreaded was their fatal effect when they chanced to strike near troops ; for this had been experienced in distressing examples. On this day, a ten-inch shed, fired from Captain Craig's Company A, Sixth Michigan, struck inside the garrison's battery (No. 5, sand-bag battery), and went through six feet of earth and three layers of pine-logs, hterady burying twenty-six men, of whom one was kided and five were wounded. During the previous night, Blankenship's battery had throAvn fifty-four eight-inch sheds inside the garri- son works. In course of the day, he fired only six rounds. There was a moderate amount of firing by the besiegers' artd- lery, but very little from the garrison. The twenty-pounders of the Eighteenth New York were engaged nearly ad day but were not repded to. Armstrong's battery was not annoyed, and he, having been directed not to bring on an engagement without orders from the corps commander, his thirty-pounders only fired occasional shots. The X-inch mortars of the Sixth Michigan,"], [156, "142 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. in front of McDermett, were actively engaged, and disabled a twenty-four-pounder howitzer in that fort. The enterprise of the besiegers on the left was marked, and Gen. Gibson was apprehensive an effort would be made to turn his right.1 Capt.

Affairs appeared to be growing critical, on account of the uncertainty and danger of their communications.2 The artdlerists were cau tioned to be prudent of ammunition, to fire only when they saw the enemy, and not to answer his artillery. They had to report hoAV their ammunition was expended, and make requisition every night for what they would need the ensuing twenty-four hours. The planting of torpedoes in front of the garrison works, and where there appeared most danger of close approach, was renewed. The previous night Gen. Holtzclaw had staked out a new line running off from Bed fort, intending to withdraw his left, and thus materially shorten the garrison line ; but, in course of the forenoon, Mack's twenty-pounder rifles swept down the stakes with their fire ; Holtzclaw told Gibson that the besiegers had already got the range of his proposed neAv line, and the purpose of occupying it was abandoned.

The right branch of Battery No. 8, was finished the 6th. There was but httle artidery firing during the day. Granger ordered the two thirty-pounders of Capt. Armstrong's battery (First Indiana) to be brought to bear in an enfilading fire upon the garrison's rifle-pits in front of Bed fort. The embrasures not admitting of this, Armstrong proposed to move one of his guns out on open ground some yards to the left, whence there would be good range. After some hesitation, permission was given him to do this. Fifteen rounds of case shot and shed were fired on the pits, causing the confederate sharpshooters to scamper out of them before night, and several shots were fired during the night. When the gun was taken out a continued fire on the gunners was kept up by sharpshooters in front of Mc- Dermett, but they were about eight hundred yards off, and in flicted no injury. Meantime, a rope was attached to the trad of the gun, and men placed in readiness to haul it into the works in case the garrison guns opened upon it. Blankenship's mortars (Company B, First Indiana) fired only five rounds during the day. Capt. Bichard Campbefi (Battery I, Fust Indiana) assumed command of three twenty-pounders in McArthur's front. Wimmer withdrew his four guns from Minette bay battery, and moved to works in front of Blakely. While withdrawing, there was a heavy fire on the battery from the confederate gun boats. There was no interruption, of course, of work in the trenches. On the left, the Twenty-third Iowa and Ninety-fourth Elinois were in the front, and established a new line, taking some rifle pits, in which were found three confederates, dead.

But on the morning of the 7th, the flagship signalled the Octorara to fire, which she did. The fire was continued at intervals during the day, the supply of ammunition not admitting of constant filing.

At Tracy the sand-bag additions to the parapet progressed, and a telegraph was started direct to Mobile. In Spanish fort Capt.

The garrison experienced increasing danger from the besiegers' enfilading batteries, and constructed additional traverses and bombproofs for cover.

Williams, who had been chief of artdlery in Stewart's corps, expected to finish a battery for four twelve-pounders, on Holtzclaw's left, to enfilade the besiegers' left, and expected to have the guns in position the ensuing night.

There had now been con structed in this corps, besides the batteries, ten thousand five hundred yards of paradel and sap.

McArthur's division of the Sixteenth corps had constructed three thousand nine hunched and seventy-five yards of paradel, and two thousand and thirty-five yards of sap besides two bat-"], [163, "SPANISH FORT\u2014 View from Works of Thirteenth Corps\u2014 Showing \"McDer.mett.\""], [164, ""], [165, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 149 teries for heavy guns. Hubbard's brigade of that division had approached nearest to the garrison works, the head of the sap from his second paradel being only sixty yards from Bed fort. Carr's division, in addition to work on paradels and saps, had done most of the work of batteries for about fifty guns, in cluding mortars. In his front the siege had been pushed, as everywhere else, with unceasing vigor and industry. There were two wed-defined paradels, and some work done on the third ; four approaches or saps, two of which admitted of artil lery passing under cover ; and in front of Moore's brigade there were two approaches extending within a hundred yards of the main works of the garrison. On Carr's right flank, across the swamp, a gabion work had been extended by carrying earth from the high ground, affording cover to sharpshooters, a hun dred yards from the garrison's left. There were now in position in the Minette bay battery four thhty-pounder and two one-hundred-pounder rifles ; against Spanish fort, fifty -three siege guns (incluchng nine twenty-pound er rifles and sixteen mortars) and thirty-seven field guns (the Seventh Massachusetts was withdrawn and moved to Blakely) : total ninety-six guns. Four siege rifles and five siege howitzers on the left centre enfiladed the garrison's centre and left ; and four siege howitzers close in on the extreme right enfiladed their centre. A bombardment, which proved to be the final one, opened from all these guns at had-past five, p. M., and continued tid had past seven, p. m. The twenty-pounders of the Eighteenth New York, Capt. Mack, again fired the signal. Gen. Canby was intending to assault the garrison's works the following morning at eight o'clock. But the corps commanders had received instructions, when the investment commenced, to push forward the works as fast as consistent with due care of the men, and to take advantage of every opportunity that"], [166, "150 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. promised successful and decisive results, but not to attempt an assault without that assurance. Before the bombardment commenced the besiegers took the precaution to double the force of their sharpshooters and the reserves. The garrison having arranged for a general artidery fire, opened before the bombardment was commenced by the be siegers. Mack having given the signal, directed his fire principady against McDermett. The shot and shed from the latter came against his battery thick and fast. His works were struck at least fifty times, but not one of his men received even a scratch. Eight guns were being fired from McDermett. Earder in the day, one of Capt. Mack's guns had done splendid execution on Bed fort, in knocking away two of its embrasrues, and a solid shot struck down an officer at a distance of three fifths of a mile. The four thirty-pounders of Capt. Armstrong's battery (M, First Indiana), each fired every had-minute. The section of his battery near the right of the Thirteenth corps, had been much annoyed by the garrison's sharpshooters, and one of the cannoniers, Private Wm. H. Sparks, was badly wounded in the forehead. Up to five o'clock in the afternoon, Capt. Blankenship's mor tars had fired forty rounds. During the bombardment they fired one hundred and twenty rounds. The batteries of Bough, Cox, and Hendricks, were doing good service. The latter had one man wounded. In Cox's battery four were wounded. It has been seen that the greater part of the First Indiana heavy artillery was engaged in the siege. The regiment was under the command of Col. B. F. Hays, who was assisted during the siege by Maj. James M. Connelly, in front of the Sixteenth corps, and Maj. J. W. Day, in front of"], [167, ""], [168, ""], [169, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 151 the Thirteenth corps. During the siege, Battery B expended five hundred and seventy rounds of ten-inch shed, and six hun dred and thirty-nine of eight-inch shed ; C, two hundred and eighty-six rounds ; H, seven hundred and one rounds ; I, four hunched and eleven rounds ; K, seven hundred and twenty rounds ; L, six hundred and forty-three rounds ; M, four hun dred rounds. The fire of so many large guns, and the loud explosion of shells, produced one of those sublime scenes which seldom occur, even in the grandest operations of war. There is scarcely anything in the phenomena of nature to which it could be compared ; certainly not the distant murmur of the thunder, nor its near and startling crash. Vet, in moun tain storms may have been witnessed a scene to which this grand commingling of many thunders forms some comparison. It is when a storm having risen, the dark clouds seem to lin ger on the mountain-tops, and from all quarters of the heavens the awful bolts burst forth simultaneously. ASSAULT. Gen. CaiT having pushed his works on the right about as close to the garrison works as practicable, concluded to take advantage of the cannonading, and carry, by assault on their flank, some two hundred yards of the confederate left, and gain a crest covered with a grove of pines. The possession of that point he rightly judged would give him a commanding position for a battery, and afford an effective fire in reverse on their Avorks by infantry. Ector's brigade, in his front, comprised the Ninth, Tenth, Fourteenth, and Thirty-second Texas regiments, and the Twenty-ninth and Thirty-ninth North Carolina regiments. After the bombardment had commenced, and at about six o'clock, Col. Geddes, commanding the brigade, went to Lieut.-"], [170, "152 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Col. Bed, then commanding the Eighth Iowa infantry volun teers, informed him that Gen. Carr and himself had concluded to advance two companies on the crest of the hid, well up to the confederate works, as a picket guard, and that they could intrench themselves during the night. He instructed Col. Bed to accompdsh this in any manner he chose, but to be particular to keep his regiment behind the gabion work, which was on the right, across the swamp. Col. Geddes inquhed how long it would take him to get ready and commence the advance of the two companies, so that he could return to the rifle-pits and direct the fire of the brigade, and attract the attention of the garrison forces in his front. Col. Bed replied, \" Fifteen min utes ;\" yet he had nearly a quarter of a mile to go, the compa nies to select, and arrangements to make. At ten minutes past six, his regiment was in position behind the gabion work. Com pany A, Capt. Hem-y Muhs commanding, and Company G, Lieut. Henry Vineyard commanding, were selected for the advance, and both companies promptly moved around the right of the gabion work, and gallantly deployed forward on the centre, Capt. Muhs commanding the hne of skirmishers. They had nearly one hundred yards of ground to pass over before reaching their objective point, the most of which was wet and soft, and covered thickly with faden trees. Col. Bed accompa nied them tdl he was satisfied they would gain the desfred po sition, when he returned to the balance of the regiment behind the work. But his httle assaulting party encountered obstacles at every step. Even if they did not pause to fire, their progress could not be rapid, and the Texas troops, from behind their works, were on the alert, and resisted them with as sharp a musketry-fire as was in their power. About the time the move ment commenced, a cheer was given by the rest of the division to give the impression that a general assault was intended, and to draw attention from the real point of attack. This made the"], [171, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 153 Texas troops only the more emidous to hold their ground, and their fire grew more intense and deadly. They could also per ceive too well its effect \u2014 for a number of the gadant young men of the Eighth had already fallen. The remainder of the party had about come to a pause, and were sharply engaging the Texans, yet with disadvantage. Col. Bed then took the responsibility of sending forward Company H, Lieut. Ball commanding, to their support. And feeling anxious about the fate of those in front, and his regiment, on account of the low position they occupied, not being able to cover them at all with their fire, he sent Lieut. Clark, of Company E, to Col. Geddes, for permission to advance Avith the balance of his command. The latter, behind the gabion-works, could see the contest their comrades were engaged in, and were eager to rush forward to their assistance. Col. Bell feared that the assaulting party, if unsupported, would finady be driven back, in which case they would be almost anni hilated. In a few moments, therefore, after Lieut. Clark had started off, he ordered the remainder of the regiment forward over the gabion-work, crossing himsed in the centre, and each wing closing in and fodowing him over, a few at a time. Arriv ing on the ground held by the advance companies, it was found to be too hot a place to stop at with safety, and so, with his gadant command, he charged over the confederate works with out halting. The resistance was so vehement that his men had to engage the Texans sharply before forming, and they were, of course, in much disorder ; but there was no hesitating and no flinching. Col. Bed now noticed that a mortar-battery in his rear was bursting sheds just over him, not knoAving who he was. Some one happily suggested to him to plant the regimental colors on the captured parapet, which was clone, and he also waved his hat for the battery to throw its sheds farther up the line. A num ber of the Eighth had faden before reaching the garrison works. Early in the assault, Henry Vineyard, first lieutenant, Companv"], [172, "154 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. G, was struck in the left arm by a musket-bad; but hardly noti cing it he pushed on. Near the crest of the hdl his left thigh was fractured, aud it proved to be a mortal wound. Some of his comrades gathered around him, but he said : \" Pay no atten tion to me, boys \u2014 move on.\" Col. Bed sent information to Col. Geddes of his success, and requested support. But it was dark and his regiment had been engaged an hour before any assistance came. Meantime, the musketry fire was intense. For the rest of Carr's division was maintaining a constant fire from their front, partly as a diversion to the assault. At a distance the sound was terrible. It seemed as d the contestants were grappling in a close death struggle. And they were. On entering the works the Eighth Iowa became furiously engaged with the Texas and North Carohna troops, and many fed on both sides. But the Eighth kept forming as they fought ; and rushing closer and closer upon their adversaries finady made them yield. Those who could not escape they captured. Such was the clamor of the firing on all parts of the line, that this combat, sharp as it had been, was haredy discernible by those not engaged in it. Hence those of the Texans next on the right, being in detached pits, were surprised when the Eighth Iowa advanced upon them. There were from four to a dozen of them in a pit. The pits were deep and a few yards apart. Detachments of the Eighth rushed eagerly upon them demanding their surrender. Some of them comphed. But there were many who refused, even when the bayonet was at their breast, and the muzzle of the musket at their head. They fought to the last moment, and then, with the words, \" I never wid surrender\" on their lips, met death in a fearless manner. Some were taken prisoners who were less noble and brave, for, after being ordered to surrender by the men of the Eighth, they would first fire on them, and then throw up both hands and surrender."], [173, "155 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Lieut.-Col. Bell, with his command, captured about three hundred yards of the confederate works, three stand of colors, and three hundred and fifty prisoners. The loss of the regiment was five enlisted men killed, three commissioned officers and seventeen enlisted men wounded, some mortady. The officers wounded were Capt. F. P. Ket lenring, Company B ; Lieut. Henry Vineyard (mortady), and Lieut. Spencer Smith, Company A. Entering the garrison works alone, maintaining there a severe struggle, and, finady, in a victorious manner, SAveeping along the rear, capturing works and prisoners, was a daring and romantic exploit, and justly entitles the Eighth Iowa to bril liant distinction. It was an achievement which called forth and wed idustrated the best elements of solchership. It was some time after dark before any regiment came to Col. Bed's support. The first troops that entered the works after him was the Eighty-first Illinois, Lieut.-Col. Bogers com manding. It had three men wounded in the engagement that evening. Next fodowed the One Hundred and Eighth Illinois, Col. Turner, and the One Hundred and Twenty-fourth Illinois, Col. Howe. Each of these regiments, and their commanders, chd ad that was required of them in the action, in a gadant manner. Col. Geddes, the brigade commander, also came up, and apprehending an attempt on the part of the garrison to recover the works which had been captured, placed Lieut.-Col. Bed, with the Eighth Iowa, outside of the garrison works, fronting toward them. About the same time he placed Col. Turner, of the One Hundred and Eighth Illinois, in temporary command of ad the troops of his brigade present. As soon as Gen. Carr had learned the success of the Eighth Iowa, he gave orders for a line of rifle-pits to be thrown up at the extent of the ground taken, and perpendicular to the garri son works. And the work was commenced."], [174, "156 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Carr then hastened to the naval battery, where were Gens. Canby and A. J. Smith, and informed the commanding general what had been done ; and he was ordered to fodow up the advantage gained as far as possible. In the mean time, the filing had been very sharp on the other flank in front of McDermett. The Nineteenth Iowa were in the advance rifle-pits, and their fire and that of the batteries had about sdenced the guns in that work. The garrison was then so much pressed that Col. Bruce was apprehensive of an attack to drive him back, and he had ordered bayonets to be fixed. Pretty soon the Twenty-third Iowa, Col. Glasgow, came up to the front on the double quick, and Bruce then expected an assault was to be made. As soon as Gen. Gibson learned that the fine had been broken on his left, he directed Gen. Holtzclaw to have it restored ; but he was informed by the latter that the Texas brigade was doubled up, and in confusion, and that the attacking force was too strong to be driven back. These officers then had a hurried consultation, and determined it was best to evacuate. But to render this safe it was necessary, of course, that thejr should hold Carr's division in check ; and reinforcements Avere sent as soon as possible for that purpose. The Eighth Iowa was first brought to a stand by Coleman's North Carolina regiment and a detachment of garrison (or pro vost) guards, commanded by Lieut. A. G. Clark, of Gen. Gib son's staff, and Lieut. Holtzclaw, aide to Gen. Holtzclaw. This force formed perpendicular to their main works. Its strength was between two hunched and three hundred, and must have felt it was confronting superior numbers. Nevertheless they realized that the safety of the garrison depended upon their valor, and also that it was perilous to remain there on the defen sive. A charge was ordered and attempted. But Carr's ad vance remained steadfast, except that a few skirmishers were"], [175, "157 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. driven back, and the charge repulsed with loss. The two aides, radying their men, led them forward with a dauntless spirit. Lieut. Clark was killed; Lieut. Holtzclaw, severely wounded. It was this bold front that enabled the garrison safely to escape. Col. Zacharie, commanding Twenty-fifth Louisiana infantry, had now come up with some sixty men of his regiment. He had left his position near McDermett and had double-quicked to Gib son's headquarters, and thence out to the left, with instructions to do what he could to restore the line. He first formed, with his left covering the treadway, and his right throAvn forward, and soon afterward advanced. In a short time he sent forward a few men as scouts to reconnoitre, but they returned saying they could see nothing of the federal fine. He sent others but Avith no better success. In about an hour and a had he sent forward a captain, one sergeant, and two men from the Twenty-second Louisiana, telling them to go tdl they discovered the federal line. They went but were captured. The ground in front of the fede rals was thickly covered with timber and underbrush, and cut by deep ravines. It being also dark, it was natural that they should be cautious and make sure of the advantage aheady gained. Gibson was withdrawing his forces on the treadway across the swamp. This treadway extended out to the river at Fort Hu ger, where the garrison crossed over in boats and embarked as fast as possible on transports. But the treadway was only two feet wide, and the passage over it was sIoav. Moreover, to pre vent noise, the troops took off their shoes and stockings and walked barefooted. The purpose of evacuating was cautiously imparted and went round to the officers in a whisper ; for it was apprehended some of the troops would loucdy object. The first movements, there fore, were in the nature of a feint. When the right wing left"], [176, "158 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. their quarters, many of the men thought they were going to reinforce the left. At about nine o'clock, Capt. Garrity sent in a requisition for ammunition. The heutenant brought back a handful of spikes to spike the guns. He and his command left an hour after ward. Between ten and eleven, Gen. HoltzclaAv informed Col. Zacharie that he was evacuating, and to exercise his discretion as to when he would withdraw. In a short time after Zacharie withdrew as rear-guard, with the Sixteenth Louisiana, Lieut. Col. Lindsay, who had made the charge the morning of 27th March, as rear-guard proper. Before their final departure, however, a party of these troops had gone up to within fifty yards of Carr's advance, and on receiving a vodey fed back and were seen no more. During the evening one of the confederate parties that charged Carr's ad vance, came up within thirty yards calling out \"we surrender,\" and then fired. The Eighth Iowa fired on them and fixed bayo nets, at which they faced about and ran rapidly back. Soon after the Eighth Iowa made a lodgment, Carr had ordered Col. Moore to leave three hundred men in the trenches and with the balance of his brigade move round to the right to reinforce Geddes' brigade. After having made this movement, Moore set the Ninety-fifth Illinois, Col. Blanding, to opening a road through the abatis and works for troops and artidery to pass ; it being the general impression that the garrison's left was AvithdraAvn merely to an interior line. He also posted the Thirty-third Wisconsin so as to flank the confederates should they attempt to change their supposed front. At nine o'clock, perceiving that Geddes' brigade had not developed this supposed new line of the confederates, on his own responsibdity he moved back to his old front. Then, by his directions, Major James, Seventy-second Illinois, with the three hundred men who had been left in the trenches"], [177, "159 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. charged the garrison skirmishers remaining in the advance pits, unconscious of the evacuation, and captured them easily. Moore then moved the balance of his brigade over the main works. About the same time Ward's brigade captured the garrison skhmishers in its front. Some of the latter caded out, \"Don't shoot, Yanks, we are coming in.\" And they were as good as their word. Moore soon wheeled to the left, charged along the garrison works in reverse and flank, and captured a number of prisoners, and kept on till he got to Old Spanish fort where a few more prisoners were captured. Learning there from a prisoner how the garrison had escaped, he, with the Thirty-third Wisconsin, hastened down to the foot-bridge but was too late to accom plish anything. Geddes with his brigade reached Old Spanish fort between eleven and twelve, and the men being tired after so much watch ing and fighting, arms were stacked and they were adowed to rest. There was now a scramble for the hams and com-meal left by the garrison ; and especially was there a scramble for pos session of the captured guns. At midnight, the Octorara aimed a hundred-pounder shell at Old Spanish fort, and although it went some distance beyond, the troops thought it prudent to change their position for the present. After leaving proper guards over the captured prop erty, Carr's division returned to their quarters, haAing in their possession between four hunched and five hundred prisoners. It had done a splendid day's work. As soon as Gen.

The men cheered ad along the line."], [178, "160 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. The divisions on Carr's left it appears took the confederate pickets in their respective fronts. But this was not done tid after midnight. In McArthur's division, Capt. French, Fdth Minnesota, of Hubbard's brigade, having charge of the sharp shooters, captured those in front of that brigade, and was fodowed over the works by the Forty-seventh Illinois, Maj. Bonham commanding. McArthur's division captured one com missioned officer and forty-nine enlisted men. The ground in front of the confederate main works was con siderably mined with torpedoes \u2014 or as they were called, sub terra sheds. Marshad's entire brigade, of McArthur's division, moved into the fort before dayhght. There were some confed erate dead, then, to be seen in their front lying upon the ground. Of these one appeared to have been killed by a musket-bad while planting a torpedo. Close by him was a spade ; also a torpedo planted about two feet in the ground, but not yet cov ered. They buried him there with it. In front of Day's brigade, Benson's division, Capt. Shepherd, Company F, Ninety-first Illinois, had charge of the skirmish line, and hearing the shouts of Carr's division entered the works in his front unopposed, with a detachment of the Ninety-first and the Fiftieth Indiana. In the brigade front of Col. Krez a detachment of his brigade first entered under Maj. Boydston, of the Thirty-third Iowa, and on the extreme left, at about midnight, Col. McNulta with the Forty-ninth Idinois entered McDermett capturing the picket in front, and soon after had the colors raised over that heavy work amid the loud cheers of the dehghted men. The siege of Spanish fort was at an end. About five hundred prisoners and ad the artidery, nearly fifty pieces, captured. Bertram's brigade was ordered to remain, and garrison Spanish fort, with instructions to collect and take charge of the ord nance and other property. Ad the rest of the infantry, and"], [179, "161 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. most of the artillery, were ordered to move immediately to Blakely. In the Thirteenth corps the loss had been : in Benson's division, sixteen killed, one hundred and sixteen wounded, twenty-seven captured, and one missing in action \u2014 total, one hundred and sixty ; in Bertram's brigade, about eighty, kdled and Avounded. In McArthur's and Carr's divisions of the Sixteenth corps, the entire loss, in the siege, was twenty-six kided, three hun dred and nineteen wounded and captured. As soon as Gen. Canby knew of Carr's assault, he telegraphed to Gen. Steele, at Blakely, to send doAvn a brigade, to reinforce that part of the line. Slack's brigade moved down promptly, and reported to Gen. Smith, but the latter sent them back, saying he wanted no assistance. While this brigade was rest ing, near the shore of Bay Minette, and the men were talking and laughing, a part of the garrison, in their retreat, were pass ing along on the marsh, not many yards from them, and within hearing. Retreat of the Garrison. \u2014 As the rear-guard of the garrison were stepping upon the treadway, they heard tremendous cheering up at McDermett, which must have been soon after the Ninety-fourth Illinois had entered. Shortly after, they heard cheering on the road leading to Blakely, and conjectured their victors were already on the march for that place ; but the troops they heard must have been Slack's brigade, which started back to Blakely soon after midnight. There was no little excitement among the confederates as they thronged the marshy bank at the end of the treadway. Some shells had passed closely over them from the right of the Sixteenth corps, as they had come over the treadway, and the place they occupied was commanded by several of the besiegers' batteries. Wind and tide were against them, and they thought 11"], [180, "162 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. it unsafe to use any other vessels than the fight-draught blockade-runners. Their passage over to Huger was, therefore, slow, and they were stid huddled on the marshy bank, with a prospect of daylight finding hundreds of them stdl there. At this juncture, it being midnight, Col. Lockett, chief engineer, proposed to Gen. Gibson that a portion of the troops endeavor to make their way up to Blakely through the marsh. Being acquainted with the locality, he offered to guide the column himsed. The suggestion was adopted, and about a thousand of the garrison took up the march for Blakely. The distance was five miles. The march was difficult, but not so difficult as might have been apprehended ; for there are few things the soldier's resolution cannot overcome. The route lay through mud and water, through marsh grass, canebrakes, or thick underbrush, and over bayous. The men often sank down in the swamps, and sometimes had to be puded out by their com rades. It was reported that some were lost, but the better opinion is they ad arrived safely at Blakely. They reached that place at dawn, thoroughly exhausted and presenting a singular appearance. In course of the day, they proceeded on steamers to Mobde."], [181, "CHAPTER XX. OBSERVATIONS ON THE SIEGE OF SPANISH FORT. Gen. Beauregard considered it a mistake for the confederates to garrison any part of the Eastern shore of Mobde bay. His opinion was that Huger and Tracy should have been made sed sustaining forts, and that the main garrison should be in Mobde. That appears to be the better opinion. The object of holding Spanish fort was to protect Huger by preventing the establishment of batteries to bombard the latter. But it really could not effect much in that respect, because some distance north of Spanish fort, on the shore of Bay Minette, the site of batteries actually estabdshed, guns could be placed which in two weeks time would have crushed Huger and Tracy. Nevertheless, there was an advantage to the confederates in having Spanish fort. It was a cover whence parties could have been sent out to obstruct the communications of the federals, and operating as the former could on interior hnes they could have concentrated a sufficient force there to cause much an- noyance. This suggests the answer to the opinion expressed by some confederate engineers, that it was a mistake in the federal com mander to have noticed Spanish fort at ad, they holchng, that it would have been better for his purpose to have passed those works and attempted the destruction of Huger and Tracy, with bat teries on Bay Minette or shore ; or passing ad the eastern-shore garrisons to have gone round to the confluence of the Tombigbee"], [182, "164 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. and the Alabama, the occupation of Mobde by the confederates being then a question of supphes. Undoubtedly the evacuation of Spanish fort could have been compeded by indirect opera tions, yet before the accomphshment of that, was there not too much danger to be apprehended to the communications, d an enterprising enemy should be left in a strong position on the very line necessary to use ? On the 12th Aprd, Gen. Maury left Mobile, with four thousand five hundred infantry. About five hundred had been captured at Spanish fort, three thousand at Blakely, and the kdled and wounded must have numbered at both places five hunched ; so, that at the beginning of the siege his effective force must have been about nine thousand. If an opportunity had warranted, this force could, with but httle trouble, have concentrated at Spanish fort. But it would have been dangerous to have had had that force sadying out from that garrison. The garrison fudy expected to be assaulted on the 27th of March. That was one reason why it was not best to assault. The character of the works were not then fudy known to the fed erals. Furthermore, there was no pressing necessity nor special object to be gained by an immediate assault. On the contrary not much would have been gained in time as the army would stdl have been waiting for supplies. As has been seen, some portions of the fortifications around Spanish fort were quite elab orate, as also the obstructions in front ; and they had been made by skilful engineers. The troops behind them were veterans. Ordinary prudence would dictate that the besiegers shoidd at least have one line of works behind which they could fad back in security in case of an unexpected accident or reverse. Nev ertheless d a general assault had been ordered on the first day or on any subsequent day, there is no doubt it would have been successful. And this is the opinion of the garrison officers. But it would have been stubbornly resisted, and success would"], [183, "165 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. have cost many valuable hves. The best place for the assault was where it occurred ; for it was the weakest part of the garri son's line. The fact that it was unexpected and the darkness probably are the reasons for its not being fodowed up rapidly enough to capture ad the garrison. Gen. Canby had already de termined to carry the works by a general assault the next morn ing at eight o'clock, which no doubt would have been a lucky hour ; for the garrison commander had cautioned his troops to \"be prepared for an assault every morning before daylight, ev ery day at twelve, m., and every evening before dark.\" An as sault would not have been expected at eight. The besiegers and garrison ahke are entitled to praise for con stant industry and for energy. The besiegers had the most work to do ; and the works constructed wid long remain as evi dence of their wdling tod. The garrison commander, Gen. Gibson, was competent and active, and inspired his troops with enthusiasm. He was highly complimented by his superior officers for his conduct during the siege. Second to him in command was Gen. Holtzclaw, also an accomphshed and earnest officer. In fact the officers and troops comprising the garrison were remnants of many historic campaigns, and possessed no smad share of culture and spirit. The only neglect which can be cited against the garrison was their failure to construct strong and connected works on their left down across the swamp. This is where they were assaulted. Their works there were disconnected and their occupants were captured in detail. More industry and care there would have enabled them to repulse the attack, or would have prevented the attack that was made. The garrison displayed uncommon resolution and courage in the frequency of its sorties. About a dozen must have been made in ad. One was attended with bridiant success. Holtz-"], [184, "166 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. claw had arranged for two more sorties on the night of the 8th. They were intended against the right and left of McArthur. It appears that a formal siege of Spanish fort, with heavy artidery, was not decided upon tid after the investment. Siege batteries were then sent for and brought on transports from the forts at the mouth of the bay. During the siege the ammuni tion was brought up from Fort Morgan, and the labor of land ing it there was performed by the Sixth Michigan. Some experienced confederate artillerists at Spanish fort expressed the opinion that the firing of the besiegers' land bat teries was not generally good. While the results of the latter's fire must be their justification, it is proper to remark that there was some complaint about the ammunition. Col. Hays, com manding First Indiana heavy artidery, states in his report that the Hotchkiss pattern of solid shot would end over when fired, and that the shells would burst prematurely. The sheds, he says, were made more effective by emptying out the powder with which they were charged and refilling them with sand, and then using them as solid shot. Alioays seek an Enfilading Fire. \u2014 The engineer operations of the besiegers were directed by Gen. Comstock and Col. McAl lister, and were conducted with skid and energy. Positions were soon selected and batteries started whence damaging enfilading fire could be delivered ; an object ever to be kept in view in the use of all arms. Have tlie Trenches continuous, and Approaches secure. \u2014 The stumps and faden trees afforded so much cover to the besiegers' skirmishers that even the first or second day they got out some hundreds of yards beyond any continuous line of rifle-pits. They continued to occupy such advanced positions before approaches to them were started ; and were consequently in a very exposed situation. The result of this was the loss of a captain and twenty men in Benson's front. If, as should have been done,"], [185, "167 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. an approach had been started and fodowed close up to the line occupied by the skirmishers, they could then have retreated when so severely sheded, or reinforcements could have been sent to them. As it was, they were at the mercy of the gar rison. In a siege, the skirmishers or picket should be but a short distance from the advance line of Avorks, unless they have a safe approach from that line to their posts. The loss of twenty men in a siege, out of rifle-pits, has much more moral effect than the loss of the same number on an open batfie-field. Scipio is said to have been overjoyed when ho inflicted on C\u00e6sar a loss of only twenty-seven men, and that on open ground."], [186, "CHAPTER XXI. SIEGE OF BLAKELY\u2014 SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH DAYS. April 3 \u2014 Second Day of the Siege. \u2014 The ground lying between the combatants, viewed from a distance, appeared level, but it was much cut up by ravines, the sides of which were scadoped with numerous and deep depressions. Some of the ravines ran paradel with the confederate works, others perpendicular tc them, and affording a damaging fire for their artidery. Along the bottoms of the principal ravines ran clear and gurgling brooks, had concealed by the luxuriant bushes and vines, and the banks of which were marshy. The general elevation of the ground was eighty feet above the water, and sixty feet was, per haps, the greatest depth of any of the raA\"ines. Where the Second division commenced its first line of in trenchments, a thousand yards from the main line of the con federates, the ground was a little higher than that occupied by the latter ; and from that position there was a gradual dechne for three hundred yards toward the front. The ground occu pied by the colored division was about on a level with the con federate works. The position of both divisions was favorable on two accounts \u2014 it was in the woods, and there was an abundance of good running water. In Hawkins' division the work of intrenchment was con tinued ; but that division suffered considerably from the con federate artidery, and especiady from the gunboats, which, to some extent, had an enfilading fire. Scofield's brigade was held in reserve ; but at night the Fdtieth, Col. Gdchrist, and"], [187, "169 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. the Fdty-first, Col. Webber, were sent to the front, and the brigade commander was there with them tid eleven, p. M., when the work was ordered discontinued. In the Second division, Moore's brigade closed up to the right, connecting with Spiceley's brigade ; but between them was a wooded ravine and running stream. The latter was bridged during the day, and both brigades made considerable progress in the first strong and continuous line of intrench ments. Spiceley's brigade was extended two hundred yards to the right to connect with Hawkins' division. And in the evening the skirmishers of that brigade gained thirty yards to the front, and established new detached pits. The camp of each regiment was close to the first fine of intrenchments, and so arranged as to have some natural shel ter of the ground. In Spiceley's brigade, the Twenty-fourth Indiana, Lieut.-Col. Sears, was on the right. Next, on the left, were the Sixty seventh Illinois, Col. Busey ; the Sixty-ninth Indiana, Lieut.- Col. Perry ; the Seventy-sixth Illinois, Lieut.-Col. Vifquain. In Moore's brigade, the Eighty-third Ohio, Lieut.-Col. Bald win, was on the right, and next the One Hundred and Four teenth Ohio, Col. Kedy ; the Twentieth Iowa, Lieut.-Col. Leake ; the Thirty-seventh Illinois, Col. Black ; and the Thirty-fourth Iowa, Col. Clark. The casualties in the division, were one kdled and five wounded. Of the latter was Col. Spiceley, who was not, however, stopped from his active duties. Toward evening, certain movements of the confederates in front of Moore's brigade, excited the suspicion of a sortie, and Hotchkiss' Second Connecticut battery was sent round to the left ; but it did not go into position, and returned to its camp, near the Stockton road, at dark."], [188, "170 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Gen. Steele had his headquarters at O. Sibley's. The head quarters of the Second division were moved from near the Stockton road to a ravine at a point six hundred yards in rear of the centre of the division. The headquarters of the Colored division were also in a ravine in rear of about the centre of the division. Veatch's division, of the Thirteenth corps, having received orders, at midnight of the 2d, to move immediately to reinforce Steele, arrived before Blakely at daylight of the 3d ; and in course of the forenoon took position, with a brigade front, across the Pensacola road. But Garrard's division, of the Sixteenth corps, having also come up from C. Sibley's on the 3d, went into position on the left of the Pensacola road, a thousand yards from the confederate works, Col. Binaker's brigade being on the right, Gen. Gilbert's in the centre, and Col. Harris' on the left. Veatch's division was then withdraAvn and remained near O. Sibley's, as a reserve. During the ensuing night, Garrard's division covered its front with a line of rifle-pits, and the skirmishers of each brigade occupied ground some distance in advance. The Tenth Kansas, of Gdbert's brigade, had three men wounded, one mortady. In Harris' brigade, the Eleventh Wisconsin supported the skirinish line, and kept within fifty yards of it. At eleven, p. M., the skirmish fine was warmly engaged, and the commanding officer of the Eleventh sent forward a company to reinforce it. At the same time he received information that the confederates had come out of their works, and were flanking the skirmishers on the left. He then sent Companies E and G to protect the flank. The firing continued through the night, but darkness deprived it of effect, except to weary both sides equady and hold each other at bay. During the day the sharpshooters of the confederates main-"], [189, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 171 tained a watchful fire, and at intervals their artillery was sharp and savage. They had already disabled two guns by firing, and the commander sent for more.1 April 4 \u2014 Third Day of Siege of Blakely. \u2014 In the Second division, the work progressed on the first and second lines of intrenchments, and the same was occurring on Hawkins' left. In the afternoon, both divisions got a new supply of intrenching tools, and the work went on faster. Toward evening, the Second division was preparing to advance its skirmish-line. Soon after five, the men cheered, on account of the grand bombardment of Spanish fort, the mighty clamor of which was plainly heard. The shouts from many thousand voices made the confederates think that they were going to be as saulted, and at sight of the skirmish-line of Moore's brigade they fed back rapidly to an interior line of pits, so that Moore's skirmishers, consisting of detads from each regiment of the brigade, advanced nearly three hundred yards without resist ance. This carried his line out of the woods, and upon a sort of plateau on a level with the garrison's main works, and only five hundred yards distant therefrom. Intrenchments were then commenced on the line thus gained and continued, but the work was difficult, for there were numerous stumps, and the surface was strewn with faden pines. In front of Spiceley's brigade the ground was more earnestly 1 Lidell to Maury : \"April 3. \u2014 No change of importance here.

In making the advance Sergeant J. W. Ficklin, of tho Twenty-fourth Indiana, exhibited special gadantry. No loss was then suffered. Later in the evenining Corporal Haw kins of the Twenty-fourth was wounded. In Pde's and Scofield's front of Hawkins' division, the lines were advanced about two hundred yards. But that division suffered severe loss as wed from the gunboats as the sharp shooters and artillerists in front. Up to this time no artidery had been used by the besiegers. But during the night a sunken battery, with good cover for the gunners, was made on the Stockton road on a line with the first paradel, for one of the ten-pounder rifles of the Second Connect icut battery. The gun, with fidl detachment under Lieut. Gray, was put in position sometime after midnight, being hauled a quarter of a mde by hand. At nine, P. M., Dennis' brigade, of Veatch's division, moved to the front and occupied the ground between the Second divis ion and the Pensacola road connecting Avith Garrard's right. In the morning, Garrard's division advanced its skirmishers still farther to the front. In Gdbert's brigade the skhmish hue was commanded by Maj. H. S. Badey, Sixth Minnesota, and in the movement two were kdled and several wounded. Maj. Badey had a rib fractured by a piece of shed. Lieut. Gresham of the Sixth Minnesota was shghtly wounded. In Harris' brigade the Fdty-second Indiana and Fdty-eighth Illinois Avere on the front line, also one company of the Eleventh Wis consin as sharpshooters. Two deserters from the confederates came in and were taken by Lieut. Leonard, adjutant of the Fifty-second Indiana, to the brigade commander. They related that Blakely was garrisoned by three thousand five hunched men, and that labor was stdl being done on the works. In course of the day, Gen. Steele's chief of staff, Lieut.-Col."], [191, ""], [192, "BLAKELY \u2014 View from Centre op Second Division \u2014 Showing Confederate Redoubt No. 4."], [193, "173 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Whittlesey, was on the front hne, making observations, and com ing to where the Fdty-second Indiana was posted, he advanced fifty yards in front of the skirmish line to an old log budding, which had been used as a barrack, and climbed upon the rafters to get a good view. Being seen by the enemy, their artidery soon opened on him, and shells exploded above and around him, and through the house beneath, yet he continued to write in his note-book as d nothing was happening, tid he had finished his observations, and then descended and left. Lided reported his loss on the 4th, two kided and twelve wounded. April 5 \u2014 Fourth Day. \u2014 At the break of day, just as soon as the confederate works could be seen, Lieut. Gray opened with the ten-pounder of the Second Connecticut, from the Stockton road, firing obhquely at the work immediately south of that road, which indeed was the most prominent point of resistance, on the confederate line. Thirty rounds were fired before there Avas any reply, then the response was warm. Lieut. Gray con tinued at intervals to fire during the day and battered doAvn one of the embrasures of the assaded redoubt. Six confederate guns were brought to bear on his snug battery, and the explo sions around it were frequent and close, but hurt not a man. At night the damage to the work was repaired. Separate batteries for two more of Hotckkiss' guns were being built on the left of the Stockton road, and farther to the front than Lieut. Gray's. At night a battery was commenced near the right of Moore's brigade, for the Fifteenth Massachusetts. In the evening the skirmish line of Spiceley's brigade ad vanced one hundred and fifty yards, and intrenched within eighty yards of the confederate rifle-pits, which had a distinct line of abatis for cover. In front of Moore's brigade the skir mishers were forty yards in advance of the fine gained the pre vious evening, making their way as best they could through the"], [194, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 174 network of pine logs, and being within one hundred and sixty yards of the wed-fortified confederate sharpshooters. Both brigades now had two wed-budt lines of intrenchment with safe approaches. The men were advancing steadily and sure, and casualties, though generady fatal, were not numerous. The whole loss in the Second division during the day was three kdled and one wounded ; namely, kdled ; Sergeant S. G. Harter, Sixty-ninth Indiana, Privates C. Grove and W. L. Johnson, Twenty-fourth Indiana ; wounded, Thos. McGovem, One Hun dred and Fourteenth Ohio. In Hawkins' division, on the right, there was an apprehension at night of a sortie, and at nine, P. M., the Third brigade (Lieut.- Col. Kinsey commanding) of Veatch's division, marched out in rear of Hawkins as a reinforcement. In Veatch's front, the Eighth Illinois was on the skirmish fine, and had one man wounded. At nine, P. M., it was relieved by the Forty-sixth Illinois, Col. Dornblaser commanding, who sent out two full companies as skirmishers. The right of the line was then advanced twenty-five yards, to connect with the left of the Second division, and the left was carried forward one hundred yards, meeting with httle opposition. In Garrard's division, on the left, some advance was made in front of Harris' brigade. The Thirty -fourth New Jersey was on the skirmish-line ; but the left of that line was occupied by Company E, Eleventh Wisconsin, under command of Lieut. McDonald. During the night, the latter officer, with a few men, moved forward, across a ravine covered with slashings, to open ground, and intrenched a short distance from the con federate rifle-pits, and held his position successfully against warm resistance. In the afternoon, the position of Binaker's brigade of Gar rard's division was changed from the right to the left, but the camps were not moved tid the succeeding day. At five, P. M."], [195, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 175 Maj. Winter, of the Eighty-ninth Indiana, with five hundred men of that brigade, moved down to the left through the woods, to complete the investment of Blakely, connecting with the left of Harris' brigade, and extending as near the river as practica ble. On that part of the ground the woods extended to within four hundred yards of the right of the confederate works, and to a stream running parallel with them, and the banks of which were thickly wooded. About opposite the eighth redoubt of the confederates, that stream assumes the character of a swamp, widening as it approaches the river. It is thickly covered with trees, and the water is a foot deep. At sunset, Maj. Winter de ployed one hundred men, six paces apart, and holding four hun dred as reserve, moved to the front. His left passed over a smad field, and then the hne began to descend a hill-side, and was soon struggling across the stream and swampy ground. They were then greeted by one or two vodeys from the brow of the high ground, two hundred yards in front of them. They pressed on, and emerging from the woods and tangled underbrush, came out where the trees had been felled, and began to ascend the rise of ground, and reaching the brow, the men on his left were within two hunched yards of the garrison's main works. Maj. Winter observed that his right did not connect with the skhmish line of Harris' brigade, but that he was considerably to the left and in advance of it, and being also in some danger from the fire of that line, he sent Capt. Hub bard, of the One Hundred and Nineteenth Blinois, to notify its commander of his position. Maj. Winter had now gained a most important position, it being considerably nearer to the garrison works than any other part of the besiegers' line. It was, of course, too good a position to expect to hold with ease. A fire of artillery and musketry was opened on him, and, un fortunately, he ordered a retreat. He withdrew his fine over the stream, and commenced fortifying several hundred yards to the rear."], [196, "176 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. When Capt. Hubbard returned, he was surprised to find only the first sergeant and seventeen men of his own company, who had halted at the edge of the stream to wait for him. He thought a key position had been given up. Then posting his few men as securely as possible behind logs, he went to find the reserve ; and, after some persuasion, got permission to have Capt. Chubb's company, of the Eighty-ninth Indiana, go to the front and join his left. Maj. Winter, at the same time, advanced his reserve, and intrenched on the high ground in rear of the stream, near where an old road passes which leads into Blakely. The companies of Capts. Chubb and Hubbard took position north of that road. It was about eleven o'clock when Lieut. McDonald of the Eleventh Wisconsin made the advance before mentioned, and joined their right. Soon after, Capt. Hubbard brought forward a company of reserves with shovels, and, sending his own men a httle in advance, com menced digging rifle-pits. Lucas, with his cavahy, marched to occupy Clairborne, on the Alabama. During the day the besiegers heard of the fad of Selma. The loss in the garrison, on the 5th, was reported to be one kdled and twelve wounded. Lidell sent to Spanish fort for sharpshooters armed with the Whitworth rifles, l and reported that he had men kided and wounded at the Blakely wharf by 1 Lidell to Maury: \"April 5 The enemy have erected a battery on my left \u2014 have fired occasionally from it.

On account of limited supply of ammunition he directed the firing to be restricted to a few picked skirmishers. He also sent for firebads to light up his front, and enable him to use his artillery with more effect in the night.1 1 Liilfll lo Myers : \"April 5. \u2014 Have made for me as soon as possible some fire balls for twenty-four-pounder cohorn mortars.

SIEGE OF BLAKELY\u2014 FIFTH, SIXTH, AND SEVENTH DAYS. April 6 \u2014 The Fifth Day. \u2014 At three o'clock on the morning of the 6th, the garrison made a sortie from opposite their fourth redoubt down to their right, advancing a line with much noise and shouting, for the purpose, as it appeared, of dislodging the besiegers' skirmishers. No ground, however, was lost by the besiegers, yet a noisy combat of musketry ensued, lasting for an hour ; and above ad the turmod roared the garrison's artidery. On the extreme left of the besiegers, where were Capt. Chubb's company of the Eighty-ninth Indiana, Capt. Hubbard's of the One Hundred and Nineteenth Illinois, and Lieut. McDonald's of the Eleventh Wisconsin, the charging party came up within a few feet of the newly-dug pits, but finding them resolutely occupied had to give way. Lieut. McDonald had with him Sergeant Moore and about a dozen men. Being hard pressed, he undertook to awe his assad ants by a stratagem, and caded out \"First and Second brigade supports, forward !\" which had a good effect. In front of Moore's brigade of the Second cfiMsion, the attack appeared to be mainly against the working party on the battery which was being made for the Fifteenth Massachusetts. The atmosphere being thick and heavy, the sound of the musketry seemed closer than usual. The darkness was also complete, and, it being known how tired and worn the men were, there was some uneasiness felt at the division headquarters lest some part of the line had been forced back. Lieut. Pettibone, aide-"], [199, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 179 de-camp, hastened down to the front line alone, and brought back the pleasing intedigence that everything was right. In Garrard's division, a position about three hundred yards farther in advance was gained in front of Gilbert's and Harris' brigades. The advance was made at midnight. In front of Harris' brigade, the force consisted of Companies A, C, and H, from the Eleventh Wisconsin, under Capt. Lang, and the One Hunched and Seventy-eighth New York, and was commanded by Lieut.-Col. J. B. Gondado, of the latter regiment. In front of Gilbert's brigade, it consisted of companies from the Tenth Kansas and Thirty-second Iowa, and was commanded by Major Hutchinson, of the Thirty-second. Each man was provided Avith a spade, and, at the given signal, the line advanced in good shape, though opposed by a sharp fire. Some two hun dred and fifty yards were gained by Lieut.-Col. Gondado, which brought him about six hundred yards from the garrison's main works. The loss in his line was one killed and four wounded. Major Hutchinson was ordered to advance three hunched yards, which would bring his line also six hunched yards from the main works of the garrison. He performed the duty in a truly soldierdke manner. His men being deployed and in line, he placed himsed on their right, and, moving forward with them, caused them to dress on him, he at the same time counting the paces as he marched along, and going tid he had got the fud and required distance. His course lay near the Pensacola and Blakely road. Having gained the required distance, the whole line commenced a rifle-pit. On the left of Harris' front, Company F, Lieut. McConned, of the Eleventh Wisconsin, was posted on the opposite side of a ravine ; and being isolated from the line on his right, Com pany H, of the Eleventh, was sent to his support, and Company G, of the same regiment, was also sent to fill up the gap be tween him and the companies on his right. The balance of the"], [200, "180 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE Eleventh was held in reserve occupying the trenches vacated by the skhmish -line. Work was also being done in Garrard's division, for a battery for the Seventeenth Ohio. Ad along the line of the besiegers, the work of opening or widening trenches and approaches was progressing with vigor. In the Second division, front, two additional separate batter ies being finished for the ten-pounder rifles of the Second Con necticut, two more guns of that battery opened at daylight, one beino- under command of Lieut. Whitnev, the other under Lieut. Hanley. Both these guns as wed as the one under Lieut. Gray, were served with effect. Li the morning Corporal Beecher with one of the guns last in position, fired at the colors in the Stock ton road redoubt (No. 4), and caused the speedy removal of a couple of tents. The loss in the Second Division was only four wounded. The artillery firing by the garrison during the forenoon was fierce. Gen. Lidell reported that there was constant firing du ring the night, and that he had several men wounded in the night by stray shots.1 He asked for a company of sappers and miners. He also expected the besiegers would open the next morning with artidery from five different positions.'2 At eleven, p. m., he requested the captain of the Morgan to send two smad boats under charge of a commissioned officer to picket the mouth of the bayou, just below his right flank, and the lower mouth of the bayou, near Bay Minette. April 7 \u2014 Sixth Day. \u2014 Just before daylight the garrison i LidJl to Col. Garner, Chief of Staff: \" Blakely, April 6.\u2014 Enemy at this place keeps up a constant firing throughout the night with skirmishers, and is busily engaged erecting his batteries.

They came out; apparently in strong force, delivering repeated volleys and charging with cheers up to the pits of the federals. The artillery also per formed its part, and for two mdes along the line the tumult of the roar of musketry and cannonading was startling. At such an hour was felt how much depended on the steadfast soldier ship and activity of a few men at the front. The confederates were repulsed, and it was reported with unusual loss.1 The loss in the Tenth Kansas was one kdled. In the Fdty-second Indi ana, tAvo wounded. The five companies of the latter regiment expended during the night about seven thousand rounds of car tridges and the firing was probably in the same proportion on other parts of the line. In front of Binaker's brigade, Lieut. Col. Taylor, of the One Hundred and Nineteenth Illinois, was in command of the skirmish-line and advanced the left of it across the stream and swamp and had some pits dug. During the afternoon of the 7th and the succeeding evening, rain fed ; the ah was chidy, and duty in the muddy trenches was uncomfortable. Veatch's front was occupied by Dennis' brigade. The Twen ty-third Wisconsin was engaged in making a battery in Haw kins' front, and lost one man kided and four wounded. On the right of Hawkins, at the edge of the bluff, a fine battery was being constructed for five thirty-pounder Parrotts, under the direction of Capt. Newton, assistant-engineer, to drive off the gunboats. Large detads from the Colored division were constantly at work on it, yet many of the gabions and fascines were being made by details from Veatch's division. Working parties on the battery were concealed from the gunboats by the large forest-trees along the brow of the bluff. 1 A report, afterward captured, of Col. Laws, Second Alabama reserves, Bhowed that his loss was fifteen killed and twenty-two wounded."], [202, "182 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. The night attack had interfered with the labor on the bat tery for the twelve-pounder Napoleons of the Fifteenth Massa chusetts on the left centre of the Second division, and it was not entirely finished at daylight of the 7th. Lieut. Bowse com manding the battery, however, had. four guns in position and at that time opened fire. The redoubt opposite him was only five hundred yards distant and had two dght steel rifled guns and a twelve-pounder howitzer, whde eleven hundred yards ob liquely to his left was a thirty-pounder Parrott ; and there were several other guns in his front. The confederates returned an accurate and severe fire, filling up the embrasures and sdencing the Fdteenth in a short time. The gunners of the Fifteenth Massachusetts clung to their work with gadantry. Corporals Clark, Essex, and Gove, were mentioned for good behavior. Private George B. Cooney jumped up into the embrasure to clear out the obstructions and was seriously wounded. Two others were wounded. None of the guns, however, were injured. Work continued on the battery the ensuing night. The three ten-pounders of the Second Connecticut continued to do good service and remained uninjured. In Moore's brigade of the Second division, the third paradel was widened to from six to eight feet, and from its left an approach was being carried forward by the Thirty-seventh Illinois, under the personal direction of its commanding officer, Col. Black, and was then thirty yards to the front. In Spiceley's brigade, the third parallel was opened one hundred and fifty yards from the left, along a crest, connecting Avith an approach which had been finished the preceding day. This third line was only about five hunched yards from the con federate works, and was subject to dangerous fire from sharp shooters strongly posted on the brow of a ravine, off to the left. Only one man worked in the trench at a time. Lieut.-Col. Vdquain and Capt. Howard, of the Ninety-seventh Hhnois,"], [203, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 183 having been speciady detaded, were superintending the con struction of the rifle-pits and approaches in that brigade. The loss in the division was five wounded. Operations of the Cavalry. \u2014 Gen. Steele having dhected Lieut.-Col. Spurling to break up a party of confederates who were hovering in the rear, the latter started out in the morning on that enterprise, with twenty picked men. They disguised themselves in confederate uniform, and the neighboring citizens, supposing them to be confederates, informed Spurling that Capt. Dupree and Lieut. Fitzgerald, with twelve men, would be at a certain house at one o'clock, p. M., for the purpose of cap turing some \"Yankees\" who were in the habit of visiting there. Spurling then moved on, and met the party near the house in question, attacked them, killed one and wounded one, and cap tured the captain, lieutenant, and seven men. In the garrison, three siege guns were put in position. The VH-inch guns were waiting for platforms. New skirmish-pits were made. at night. The commander reported that he had not men enough to occupy the whole line, and asked that a hundred negroes might be sent him for fatigue duty. ' The garrison was notified that at eight o'clock on the fodow ing morning their artidery would open at ad points against the besiegers, and the skirmishers were enjoined to take ad possible advantage in their firing.2 1 Lidell to Maury : \"April 7.\u2014 Three siege guns are in position and will be ready for use to-morrow morning. The heavy guns will be delayed, for want of platforms and all necessary appliances.

If you could spare me a hundred negroes for a few nights, I could get all the approaches and traverses constructed promptly and save the men. It is better to use them than to lose them.\" 2 Capt. Lewis (A. A. 67.), to Gens. Cockrell and Thomas: \"April 7. \u2014 Gen. Lidell directs me to inform you, that at eight, a. m., to-morrow, our artillery will open upon the enemy at all points along our lines ; and he directs that"], [204, "184 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Between the skirmishers of Garrard's division, of the Six teenth corps, and of Thomas' Alabama reserves, a system of intercourse had groAvn up, which the garrison commander justly condemned. The men on the skhmish line made truces of some hours' length, during which they would meet and converse in a friendly manner, often discussing public questions relating to the war. They would also exchange newspapers, and trade coffee and sugar for tobacco. They agreed also that there should be no filing while the skhmish-fine was being relieved. Then when they resumed their places, it would sometimes hap pen that one or the other would cad out to warn his adversary that he was about to fire. The garrison commander learned that the Sixteenth corps men were \" very bold,\" and that they exposed themselves \" without being fired upon with sufficient effect to make them timid.\" To abate the mischief, he directed Gen. Thomas, commanding the reserves, to send a company to report to Gen. Cockred, to exchange for a company of his com mand, and that the old soldiers of Cockred's division should be scattered in the skirmish pits with Thomas' men. * April 8 \u2014 Seventh Day of the Siege. \u2014 At one o'clock the morning of the 8th, the garrison, with their usual enterprise advanced a strong skirmish-line, covered by the fire of artillery, against Veatch's front, and the right of the Second division, you order your skirmishers to take all advantage possible of firing upon the enemy's skirmishers and artillerists, Avhen the salvo is made.\" 1 Capt. Butler (A. A. A. 67.), to Gen. Thomas : \"April 7. \u2014 Gen. Lidell directs me to sa}', that he did not recollect the reported capture of the second pit.

He wishes you to caution your skirmishers to use their utmost vigilance in preventing the encroachments of the enemy, and directs that you send one company to report to Gen. Cockrell, to exchange for a company of his command, and he wishes you to scatter these old soldiers about in the skir mish pits with your men along the front where me enemy is now attacking.\""], [205, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 185 using, in front of the latter a blue hght for a signal. The move ment was repulsed successfudy ; but an alarm was caused ad along the line, and for an hour the filing was heavy, especiady in front of the Colored division. Gen. Osterhaus, chief of staff, rode up from Spanish fort, to ascertain what was going on ; and Gen. Canby telegraphed to Steele for the same object. The latter rephed that nothing unusual was occurring. In Veatch's front the Ninety-ninth Idinois had three men wounded in the affair, and there were shght casualties on other parts of the line. On Garrard's left, where the One Hundred and Nineteenth Blinois was on duty at the front, the first line of rifle-pits beyond the stream having been made a few yards back from the brow of the hdl, a new line of pits was made some sixty or seventy yards in advance. In the night the skir mishers moved into the neAv trench to give it a trial, and having fired a few shots to draw the fire of the confederates and then giving them a vodey aimed at the blaze of their muskets, the One Hundred and Nineteenth men raised a yell as if intending to charge. The}- heard the fire taken up all along the fine, the artillery firing on both sides, and also the confederate gun-boats ; and they thought their vodey and shouts caused ad the tumult. At eight in the forenoon, the garrison opened with ad their artillery, and fired with uncommon vehemence for an hour. The sheds frequently struck the parapets of the besiegers' rifle pits and exploded over them. There were many narrow escapes, but few casualties. Theh fire was replied to in Garrard's front by the Seventeenth Ohio hght battery ; and in Hawkins' front by two guns of the Second Massachusetts, under Lieut. Swan. The battery for the Fdteenth Massachusetts was in such condi tion that four of its guns could be served in it with safety, and they renewed theh fire with effect. The three guns of the Second"], [206, "186 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Connecticut were also engaged. In course of the day the one on the left, and farthest to the front, was disabled by its own recod. When the engagement was hottest, Col. Matthews, of the Ninety-ninta Illinois, in Veatch's front, saw a confederate flag inside the garrison in his immediate front, and he at once caused his regimental colors to be planted on the parapet of the works he occupied. This induced a livelier fire, and once his colors were knocked down by a shot, which, at the same time, com pletely covered three of his men with earth. Many of the shots, aimed at the Fifteenth Massachusetts battery, passed over and struck about the camp of Moore's brigade, and would have done much injury d the men had not been wed protected by theh earthworks. A shed passed close to Lieut.-Col. Baldwin, of the Eighty-third Ohio, and tore down a part of his quarters. Work in advancing the trenches was steadily progressing on ad parts of the besiegers' front. On the extreme left, Maj. Chapman, of the One Hundred and Twenty-second Illinois, was in command of the skirmish-line, and caused new pits to be dug farther to the left and to the front. At one point, his men occu pied a position within fifteen yards of a rifle-pit of the con federates. During the day, orders were received by the Second division to be in readiness to march with five days' rations in the haver sack and fifteen in wagons. This was most unwelcome to ad of the division, for work on trenches and approaches had been going on with enthusiasm day and night, and it was felt that whatever was in theh front must soon yield. The prospect of losing the results of theh tod might wed have dampened theh ardor ; but it did not. The crack of the sharpshooter's rifle did not abate, and the spade was none the less nimbly handled. A simdar order was sent to Carr's division, of the Sixteenth corps, then on the eve of its victorious assault on Spanish fort."], [207, "187 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. But the necessity for the movement did not occur, and neither division marched. The order was occasioned by a false alarm of confederate troops gathering in considerable force above Stockton. Combat with the Gunboats. \u2014 At ten o'clock, there was rain. At twelve o'clock, three thirty-pounder Parrotts, of Capt. Wim mer's battery (H, First Indiana heavy artillery), were in position in the battery on Hawkins' right ; and, at two o'clock, the trees having first been cut down to give a suitable range, fire was opened on the gunboats, lying a mile distant, in the Tensas. These steamers consisted of the Morgan, budt of wood and carrying eight guns ; the NashAide, clad with six inches of iron before, and with hon round the pdot-house, carrying five large guns and a hoAvitzer ; and the HuntsAide, a turtle-backed iron clad, carrying four VIH-inch guns. The heavy projectdes from these boats had annoyed the besiegers every day, striking quite close to the different headquarters ; but had inflicted the princi pal injury on the colored troops, who now raised a glad shout as they heard the first booming from the assailing battery. Expectation was at a high pitch. Drew, Whittlesey, and several other officers, were present to watch the effect of the firing, for the guns and gunners were in good repute. The thirty-pounders of the First Indiana were loaded with percus sion sheds, and the first shot struck the Morgan in her middle. That blow was the first warning the gunboats had of the exist ence of the battery; and it was a few minutes before a reply was made. In the meantime, Capt. Wimmer maintained an accurate and splendid fire. Then the Morgan and Nashvide opened on the battery and fired with accuracy, exploding their shells against its ample and wed-beaten parapets. Yet so elaborately and thoroughly had the work been made that it seemed impervious. The only casualties were two men wound-"], [208, "188 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. ed by earth thrown by a shed. The firing became intense and the effect was grand. It was not long tid the Morgan and Nashvide in a chsabled condition steamed off out of range. Then Wimmer turned his guns with solid shot on the Hunts vide, and as soon as it wTas dark she also made her escape. The Garrison. \u2014 A detail of colored men was sent to cut the timber on the right of the Ninth redoubt, and a strong picket force kept in their front. The confederate artidery endeavored, but without success, to sdence the Seventeenth Ohio battery.1 The commander of the garrison reported that his batteries were briskly repded to at eight, a. m., from several points. At nine, P. M., firebads were thrown from redoubts 1 and 4 to assist theh pickets.2 Toward night the troops on both sides re marked the awful cannonading at Spanish fort, and at ten the besiegers heard of the assault there and that a lodgment had been effected. 1 Lidell to Maury: \" April 8, 8:45, a. m. \u2014 Enemy kept up a brisk fire about half-past two, a. m., from their lines in front of 5, 6, 7, for about one and a half hours.

SIEGE OF BLAKELY\u2014 EIGHTH AND LAST DAT OF THE SIEGE. The morning of Sunday, the 9th of April, was calm, for the skirmish fine was unusuady quiet. At nine o'clock there was a shower of rain. Afterward the sun came out bright and warm, but toward evening dark clouds rolled up from the west. The fall of Spanish fort enabled Gen. Canby to send more ar tidery to Blakely, and, in course of the day, six or eight more guns opened on the side of the besiegers, but were faintly answered. The Fourth Massachusetts hght battery, Capt. Trud com manding, arrived from Spanish fort, and opened with tAvo guns from a battery in Scofield's brigade front, of Hawkins' divis ion ; and on the extreme right, two of the thirty-pounders of the First Lidiana were turned on the garrison and fired over thick timber. These, with the two light guns of the Second Massachusetts, in Pde's brigade front, made six guns engaged in Hawkins' front the last day of the siege, and they did good execution. Some of the men in Scofield's brigade were injured by sheds from a mortar in the garrison. When the thirty pounder shells from the Fhst Indiana guns were screeching over the heads of the colored troops, they cried, \" Another through train to Mobde.\" In the Second division front two ten-pounders of the Second Connecticut, and four twelve-pounders of the Fifteenth Massa chusetts, fired at intervals through the day and with much"], [210, "190 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. spirit, the latter sending some of their shots against the gar rison's left. In Veatch's front two twelve-pounders of the Seventh Massa chusetts, Capt. Storer, were in position and engaged, in an unfinished battery. But the largest proportion of the artidery the last day was in Garrard's front. Capt. Mack left Spanish fort at four, A. M., with his eighteen-pounders, and at nine, A. M., reported to Gen. Steele. The battery went into camp for a Avhde, and at five, p. M., took position nine hunched yards from the garrison works, behind a trench on Gen. Garrard's right. On his left, and considerably to the rear, were four thirty-pounder Parrotts, of Cox's and Hendrick's batteries, of the Fhst Indiana, which had come up from Spanish fort. Along his second fine of intrench ments near his right were four ten-pounder Parrotts, of Capt. Lowell's Second Illinois, and three of Capt. Bice's Seventeenth Ohio Napoleons. Late in the afternoon, four ten-pounder Par rotts, of Ginn's Third Indiana, took position farther to the left on open ground masked by timber. The besiegers now had three lines of intrenchments or con tinuous rifle-pits with approaches, the Third being within about six hundred yards of the garrison's main works, and some portions of the line were nearer. The skirmishers on Garrard's left were within three hundred yards of it, the ground there affording cover up to about that distance. On the right of Moore's brigade, of the Second division, an approach had been opened a hundred yards out from the advance parallel and within four hundred yards of the main works of the garrison, and skirmishers were posted within one hundred and forty yards of the principal hne of confederate rifle-pits. On Spiceley's left, of the same division, the paradel was within about five hunched yards of the garrison's main works, but withdrew as it extended to the right, so that from the point where it crossed"], [211, ""], [212, ""], [213, "191 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. the Stockton road the advance trench was five hundred and eighty yards from the main works in front ; but there were detached pits forty yards farther in advance. There was a safe approach to the left part of that trench ; and the soldiers with characteristic humor had put up in it a sort of .guide-board with the inscription \" ggp\" To Blakely.\" Another approach was being started thence to the front. An approach was also commenced to it from the right wing of the Twenty-fourth Indiana. In digging that advance trench two torpedoes had been excavated ; and others in Spiceley's front had been ex ploded by stray musket-balls. In Hawkins' division Pde's skirmish-line had been advanced, during the night of the 8th, one hundred and forty yards, and rifle-pits dug in the new position. On the right of Scofield's brigade an approach was extended within two hundred and forty yards of the principal hne of confederate rifle-pits. Each division commander had daily reported to Steele the progress of the works, and the casualties. Up to this time the casualties had been : in the Colored divis ion, sixteen kdled, and one hundred and seventy-six wounded ; in each of the other divisions the loss had been about four or five killed, and from twenty to thhty wounded. In the forenoon, some boats had been seen from the tree observatory in rear of the besiegers, to put out from Blakely loaded with troops. A report soon afterward flew through the trenches that the garrison was evacuating ; and this seemed to be confirmed by the unusual sdence of both theh artidery and shaipshooters. There was, therefore, a general desire ad along the line to take the first opportunity to move forward to \" feel the enemy.\" Garrard received instructions, in the forenoon, from his corps commander, to assault the works in his front in the afternoon ; and was informed that the other two divisions of the corps"], [214, "192 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. would be up to reinforce him, and that he should have ad the artidery he Avanted. Then, about three in the afternoon, Garrard had a consulta tion with his brigade commanders, at his own headquarters, Gen. Veatch also being present, and fixed upon had-past five o'clock, p. m., for an assault to be made in his front. Notice of the intended assault was immediately sent to the troops of that division by the respective brigade commanders. About three o'clock, Lieut. Pettibone, aide-de-camp, was sent from the headquarters of the Second division to obtain permis sion from Gen. Steele for that division to move on the garrison Avorks, \" as far as it could go.\" Gen. Steele was, at the same time, actively engaged making arrangements for an advance, and was found in the saddle by the aide-de-camp, who returned, saying Gen. Steele deshed the movement to be made, and fixed the time for it at had-past five, p. M. Then, not knowing that the movement was to be general, the same staff officer was sent to give notice to Gen. Hawkins of the proposed advance, that there might be concert of action. He returned with the information that Canby and Steele were both at Hawkins' headquarters, and that a general advance would be made at half-past five, p. m. Gen. Veatch received official notice at five, P. M., through Capt. Lacy, of Gen. Steele's staff, that a general advance would be made at had-past five, p. m. ; and he was directed to \" enter the enemy's works, if possible.\" The Garrison. \u2014 Ad this whde the besiegers were much de ceived, in supposing that any part of the garrison had evacu ated. The troops who had been seen to leave on steamers were a portion of the jaded force that, through mud and water, had made theh way from Spanish fort ; and not ad of them had left Blakely. Meantime, the garrison commander was informed, by signal"], [215, ""], [216, "BLAKELY\u2014 View in Front of Hawkins' Division."], [217, "193 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. telegraph from Battery Tracy, that the federal forces were moving from Spanish fort up to Blakely. As soon as he heard this he apprehended that the besiegers. Avith such reinforce ments, would be pretty certain to assault ; and he sent out the intelligence to the division and separate artidery commanders, with instructions for them to hold theh commands \" in readi ness for an assault at any moment.\"1 A copy of the order was captured, containing the endorsements of some officers, expres sive of theh ardent determination to hold their position at all hazards \u2014 which, undoubtedly, Avas the universal sentiment of the garrison. They had suffered a severe artidery fire during the forenoon, having two guns dismounted, but their artidery were saving theh ammunition to repel an assault, and abstained from replying.2 Preliminary Advance by the Colored Troops. \u2014 Previous to the general assault which took place at about six o'clock, there was an advance and sphited combat in front of the Colored division. 1 Capt. Lewis lo Gen. Cockrell and others : \"April 9. \u2014 Gen. Lidell directs me to inform you, that Col. Patton signals the following from Battery ' Tracy' : ' Wagon trains and heavy columns of infantry have been crossing Bay Minette bridge all the morning.' \" In view of the above, Gen. Lidell directs that you hold your command in readiness for an assault at any moment.\" 2 Lidell to Maury : \"April 9 We have had the constant fire of five batteries on us this morning, dismounting two guns, field pieces, including the only Blakely gun. Col. Patton has signalled Capt. Grayson (3:20 p. m.), that artillery accompanies the infantry. There is nearly one quarter of a mile, from the right of Gen. Thomas, through the swamp, and to the river, that is unoccu pied by any troops ; and the track of the garrison from Spanish fort discloses to an enemy the means of approach to this place, on that side. I shall move my quarters to that locality, and make every disposition available. I am hav ing the new place of landing prepared for the use of boats, small craft, and, possibly, steamboats.\" 13"], [218, "194 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. In Gen. Pde's brigade, which was the left one of the Colored division, the Seventy-third regiment, Lieut.-Col. Merriam, and the Eighty-sixth, Major Mudget, were in the advance trench. A httle after noon, Gen. Pde received word from each of those officers, that the confederate sharpshooters in theh front had suddenly become quiet, and they asked permission to \" feel the enemy.\" Pile then ordered one commissioned officer, and thirty select men from each regiment to be in readiness to advance. He also caused the two guns of the Fourth Massa chusetts hght artidery to fire a few shots, to see what reply woidd be ehcit. No reply was made. He, then, at about three o'clock, was starting to the front to advance, when Maj.- Gen. Osterhaus, chief of staff, rode up, dismounted, and went for ward with him. After examining the ground, Gen. Osterhaus, directed that had the men selected for the movement should get into a ravine immediately in front of the right regiment, then move up to a crest held by the skirmish-line. At a given signal they, with the remainder of the party who were to spring out of the rifle-pits on the left, were to charge and, if possible, capture the confederate rifle-pits. This was undertaken in a resolute manner, Capt. Jenkins of the Eighty-sixth, and Capt. Brown, of the Seventy-third, assisted by the skirmish-fine under Capt. Greenwood of the Eighty-sixth, leading the movement. A gad ing fire was immediately opened on them, both from the sharp shooters and artidery. They then grew more cautious and sought as they advanced what protection there was from stumps and logs. These, however, afforded but httle cover; and to advance at ad they had to jump over faden trees and logs, and were consequently much exposed. The ground was exceed ingly rough, and they had three hunched yards to go. The garrison shaipshooters had a strong line of abatis in theh front, and felt cool and confident. They took advantage of the ex posure of the assaulting party and shot down many. Capt."], [219, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 195 Brown of the Seventy-third was mortally wounded. Stdl, offi cers and men kept moving forward with self possession and courage, and though fighting at disadvantage, returned the fire with spirit. Gen. Osterhaus declared that they fought as wed as the best of troops. Perceiving, by the steady advance of the party, that they meditated a serious attack, the garrison sent out reinforcements to their skirmish-line, and the contest grew more obstinate. Here and there a man of the colored troops would fall back a few yards for better shelter, for the artillery was playing on them with searching fire, but the general fine held its ground and advanced rather than fed back. Pde reinforced them Avith five companies, with instructions to hold the ground gained and '' intrench immediately in rear of the enemy's abatis.\" In about an hour they had advanced three hundred yards, got possession of the garrison's advanced rifle-pits, and inflicted some loss on the occupants of the latter as they fell back to their breast works. The skirmish-line in front of Scofield's brigade and Drew's brigade was advanced at about four o'clock, and the confederate pits were also captured in their fronts, yet not without loss. In Drew's brigade, on the extreme right, the Sixty-eighth regiment, with Lieut.-Col. Densmore in command, and the Seventy-sixth, Major Nye, were at the front. The skirmish-line being doubled for the advance, there were four companies from each of the two regiments engaged. The movement was conducted by Col. J. B. Jones, of the Sixty-eighth by a left wheel. The men first took off their coats so as to move more readily through the brush, and charged in their shirt-sleeves. They had three hun dred yards to pass over. The skirmishers who had been on duty and were in the front first rushed out of their pits and were followed closely by the second line, ad moving on the double quick and making a deafening clamor by theh cheers. By the"], [220, "196 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. time they had gained a hunched yards the confederate skirmish ers began to retreat from their advance pits. The assaulting party met an effective artillery and musketry fire from the garri son and lost several of their number, yet they pushed on in a dauntless manner to the confederate pits, and then in obedi ence to Col. Jones' orders, laid down behind the abatis. In the charge, Col. Jones was shot through his hand with a musket bad, but continued at his work. At this time Col. Drew's reserve regiment, the Forty-eighth, Col. F. M. Crandad commanding, was in camp nearly a mde in the rear ; yet Drew, being confident that the force there present could cany the main works in his front, or else, im pelled by the enthusiasm of the moment, ordered the balance of the Sixty-eighth and Seventy-sixth to charge, giving the order \u2014 \" Forward on the enemy's works,\" at the same time wa ving his hat. This Avas only a few minutes after Jones' move ment was completed. He passed along the trench, loudly giving the command, for there was now a great din, aud com pany officers and men, as fast as they heard it direct from him \u2014 for the best disciplined could hardly be expected to be formal when they heard an order to charge \u2014 broke off on the double-quick Avith shouts, and charged Avith the greatest enthu siasm. Not starting in line, both regiments soon got mingled together, and they encountered a galling fire from every gun that could be brought to bear on them. Yet the officers were using their best endeavors to keep the men in line. The fatal track of the cannon-ball, of grape, canister, and sheds, was soon apparent. Lieut. Manhardt, of the Sixty-eighth, was instantly killed by a grape-shot, whde endeavoring to execute an order to close the men to the right. Capt. George Giger, of the Sixty-eighth, was mortady wounded while radying the men to close up to the left. Many of the men had fallen. Col. Jones, in passing along, felt something puding at his trowsers, and,"], [221, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 197 looking doAAm, a man, who was mortady wounded in the first charge, besought him to take his cartridges \"to the boys.\" Jones himsed soon after fed, stunned by the explosion of a shell. Col. Drew, and the two regiments with him, had moved along the ground on a level Avith the garrison's left redoubt, and had to face a deadly fire. At length he ordered that they should pass to the right and advance on the bluff side, where they would have some cover ; and in a few minutes ad, except a few who continued on the high ground, were skirting the brow of the bluff, intending to reach the left of the confederate works and go in if possible. The bluff side was steep and thickly covered with slashings. The ground also was springy and soft, and it was extremely difficult for the troops to get along. While a squad of men paused to fire over the brow of the bluff, others hurried along to take an advanced position, and then the former squad again would drop clown, work theh way along and take a position farther to the front. A storm of missiles Avas stid sweeping over them, and they were losing some of their number from exhaustion as wed as wounds. Finady, the last depression affording any protection was reached. From there to the main parapet was smooth ground of less than a hunched steps. Then they halted to take breath and wait the arrival of those who had fallen behind, preparatory to their last effort. A few of the men pushed on some yards below the hill, but were soon either kdled or chiven back. It soon seemed clear to them that they were too few for the work in hand. Their numbers were counted over and found to be nineteen officers and sixty-five men ! Officers in too great proportion. What was to be done ? There is reinforcement in a cheer. They cheered, fired volleys, and cheered again as d about to charge. They wondered why the reserve did not show itself, and why more of theh own comrades were not up. Many"], [222, "198 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. of the latter, poor fedows, would never again be up. Then they listened but in vain to hear any shots on their own side. They could see the garrison works teeming with men, and felt that they were in imminent danger of a sady. To go forward was folly, to go back was less to theh notion. Col. Drew then went back, to hasten up the reserve, and the senior officer left with the party was Lieut.-Col. Densmore, of the Sixty-eighth. They kept firing vodeys at the parapet and cheering. The garrison, suspecting the charging party were in trouble, attempted a sally, yet with diffidence. Capts. Holcomb, Nor wood, Lieut. Bogers, and some other officers, with a few men who kept on the high ground, had got some cover near the main works, but they and the party over the bluff were ignorant of each other's whereabouts. When the former saw the sady party starting, they fired on it with all theh might, and Densmore's men, hearing some of the shots go over, also put in a vodey, with one of theh cheers. This happy concurrence repulsed the sady. But Densmore's men did not know the result, and continued to apprehend an attack ; and, whde awaiting vsith absorbing anxiety the arrival of the reserve, they continued theh volleys and cheers. Then three ominous-appearing vessels steamed out in sight, and the men, as d willing to catch at straws, exclaimed, \" They are Union gunboats that have arrived just in season to help us !\" and then they had a cheer for the \" Union gunboats.\" Dens more said nothing to them of the confederate flag he saw at the mast-head. Shortly, the garrison ran a howitzer outside of their works, and threAv canister into the logs and brush, which compeded the colored troops to hug closer to the ground. After waiting some time, Lieut.-Col. Densmore had sent back a captain for the reserve. Afterward he sent a heutenant, charging him to let nothing but death prevent his bringing"], [223, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 199 back men or orders. He began to think he would need to send a third messenger, when an officer showed himself suffi ciently to get his attention. But the din of canister, bullets, and hand-grenades, prevented a word being heard. Then the officer took off his hat and beckoned the party back. Too indignant and suden to hurry, they retreated in order bringing back theh dead as far as possible, and taking ad theh wounded. They returned as they went, a part halting to fire whde the rest retreated to the next cover. When they had got far enough away to render it safe for the gunboats to fire with out endangering the garrison, those boats opened a raking fire along the side of the bluff. The party got back to their trenches in time to see the re serve arrive from the rear. But the httle detachment with Nor wood and Holcomb stid remained in their position, nearly up to the garrison works. As the movement commenced, this party had hastened for ward through impediments of faden tree-tops, in face of a sharp fire, and when within a hunched yards of the fort, a shower of musket-bads, thrown from cannon, beat around them. Out of eleven officers of the party, seven were there killed or wounded. They became apprehensive of a counter-charge, and of being flanked. If captured, they also apprehended that theh rights as prisoners would not be respected. After a short consultation, they rightly concluded the best thing to be done was to fight it out. Then the men fixed bayonets, and some were heard, with clenched teeth, to say they would die sooner than surrender or retreat. With fixed bayonets this gadant party charged down the line paradel with the fort, and, after a short but desperate resistance, drove the garrison sharp shooters from the interior line of abatis into their main works, and gained a position whence they could sdence the more de structive guns. Here they remained till the final assault."], [224, "200 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. THE ASSAULT. The skirmish-line of Gen. Pde's brigade had been intrenching in their new position, under heavy fire, about forty minutes, when the cheering of the white troops was heard on their left. An officer then ran in that direction tid he could see what was taking place, and quickly returning, signalled to Gen. Pde that the Second division were charging on the main works in theh front. ' Then Pde ordered forward his brigade, and the assault be came general in Hawkins' enthe front. The brigades of Pile, Scofield, and Drew, charged almost simultaneously, and carried the works in theh respective fronts. Greater gadantry than was shown by officers and men could hardly be desired. The latter were burning with an impulse to do honor to their race, and rushed forward with intense enthusiasm, in face of a ter rible fire. As they got close to the works some of the con federates, dreading to fad into theh hands, ran off to surrender to the white troops. In Drew's front, several of the confed erates, with muskets, remained outside of the works, refused to surrender, and maintained a cool and desperate struggle till they fell. In Scofield's line, the explosion of a single torpedo killed and wounded thirteen of the Fifty-first regiment. As his men were advancing, they heard a confederate officer behind the works exclaim, \" Lay low and mow the ground \u2014 the d d 1 \" This movement on my part was followed up by the Second brigade on my right, and the Avork of intrenching had been progressing, under heavy fire, forty minutes, when cheering on my left notified me that Gen. AndreAvs' division was moving forward. Still ignorant whether this was an assault on the enemy's main works, or merely a following up of the movement already made by me, I sent a staff officer to my left to report if their advance continued beyond the first line of abatis, and parallel with my advance, who immediately signalled that Gen. Andrews' division was already advancing to assault the main works.\" \u2014 Gen. Pile's Official Report."], [225, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 201 niggers are coming !\" which became a byword in camp. The colored troops captured nine guns, twenty-two commissioned officers, and two hundred and one enlisted men. The Seventy third colored regimens; \u2014 New Orleans troops\u2014 was the first of Pile's brigade to plant its colors on the parapet ; and Sergt. Edward Simon, of Company I of that regiment, was mentioned for his signal bravery. The prisoners were generady treated with kindness. A col ored soldier of the Fdtieth regiment found his former young master among the prisoners. They appeared happy to meet, and drank from the same canteen. Some of the Louisiana men, however, made an attack on the prisoners and were with difficulty restrained from injuring them. The latter almost invited attack by manifesting an unreasonable dread of the colored soldiers ; huddling together in heaps, and acting as d their captors were wild beasts. Capt. Norwood and Lieut. Gleason of the Sixty-eighth were wounded, the latter mortally, in their efforts to save the prisoners. Afterward the prisoners were taken to the camp of the Col ored division, and some of them endeavored to lead the way so as to avoid torpedoes ; yet one of the guards had his leg blown off by the explosion of a torpedo near Scofield's trenches, but nothing hke retaliation was mandested. Hawkins' loss in the assault was thirty-two killed and one hundred and forty-seven wounded. Of these a pretty large pro portion Avere officers. Several of the latter have been named. Among those who fell in the assault were Maj. Mudget of the Eighty-second, and Capt. S. B. Wilson of the Seventy- sixth, acting assistant adjutant-general on Col. Drew's staff. The total loss in kdled and wounded in that division before Bfakely was three hundred and seventy-one \u2014 namely : kdled, five com missioned officers and forty-three men ; wounded, twenty-two commissioned officers and three hunched and one men. The"], [226, "202 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. confederate loss in their front in killed and wounded was about a tlurd as large. Second Division. \u2014 Cols. Spiceley and Moore, brigade com manders, were at division headquarters about four o'clock, when the order of assault, or advance \u2014 for it was not then thought there would be much resistance \u2014 was agreed upon. It was arranged that a regiment, deployed as skirmishers, should advance in front of each brigade ; and after it had gained the distance of one hunched and fifty yards, that the remainder of the brigades should fodow, deployed in line of battle. The movement was to commence with the Second brigade, and the cheer of the skhmish-line, as it started, was to be the signal for the skhmish-hne to start in front of the Third brigade. The commander of the latter brigade, Col. Moore, selected the Eighty-third Ohio as the skirmish regi ment in his front, and the Ninety-seventh Illinois, at the re quest of its commanding officer, was designated for the skir mishers of the Second brigade. Both brigades were in the two front trenches at about had past five ; and the first notice most of the men had of the assault was the order to fad in. Of the men in camp that Sunday afternoon, some had been writing home that they were soon to march \u2014 for they were under marching orders. Others were Avashing theh clothes ; and so from the humblest duties, they hastened to take part in the grandest. Lieut.-Col. Vifquain had the Ninety-seventh deployed, and had passed along the trench once or twice to see that every thing Avas in readiness, when an explosion of a torpedo occurred on the rear edge of the trench, tearing off the leg of Capt. Wisner, of the Ninety-seventh Illinois, who was endeavoring to pass to his company, and injuring, to all appearances, fatally, one or two men. It was no happy augury ; and as the wounded were borne along the trench and approach to the rear, the"], [227, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE 203 sphits of the beholders seemed depressed. Such is the terror of concealed dangers. ' This occurrence caused a few moments' delay, and it was quarter to six when the movement commenced. Precisely at that tune, Lieut.-Col. Vdquain, in a clear, inspiring tone, and with his sword drawn, and elevated, gave the command, \" For ward, Ninety-seventh !\" Then he and his gadant regiment sprang upon the parapet, and with loud cheers, which were taken up by ad the troops left behind, they dashed foiward on the run. Instantly they were greeted with a shower of budets, and before they had got twenty yards a few men fed. In less than half a minute the Eighty-third Ohio, led by Lieut.- Col. Baldwin, swept over the parapet in their front, and, with thrilling shouts, moved, on the run, for the redoubt in their front. Three or four pieces of artidery, from the garrison, quickly opened on these regiments, firing with great rapidity, and they also encountered a bitter musketry fire. The confed erate sharpshooters at first were disposed to hold theh position ; and the men of the Ninety-seventh commenced firing when they had got eighty yards. The skirmish grew more and more bitter, the Ninety-seventh every minute gaining ground and the confed erates giving way. Whde the skhmish Avas occurring, Lieut.-Col- Vdquain ran back with a prisoner to the trench from which he had started, then hastened to his regiment and resumed the charge, fodowing the course of the Stockton road. The prisoner stated that the whole garrison stid remained at Blakely. Every one could, by that time, see that such was the fact, for the con federates were getting out of their rifle-pits and fading back to theh main works in literal swarms. Over a hundred of these were seen, in a straggling crowd, to ascend the hid on which was Bedoubt No. 4, just south of the Stockton road. At the same time the breastworks appeared numerously manned. It was apparent there was to be a much severer struggle than had been expected."], [228, "204 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. The Ninety-seventh Blinois had got but a short distance when the Seventy-sixth Bhnois, Col. S. T. Busey, sprang forward. About the same time, the Sixty-ninth Indiana, Lieut.-Col. O. Perry, also rushed forward ; and, afterward, the Twenty-fourth Indiana, Lieut.-Col. Sears, charged from the right. These regiments advanced on the run with great enthusiasm and gallantry. The Sixty-ninth Indiana took the Stockton road, and entered the confederate Avorks a httle south of that road. Lieut.-Col. Perry was severely wounded before he had got two hundred yards. The Seventy-sixth Illinois charged directly on the redoubt in theh front, the one north of the Stockton road, and preserved its allignment wed till it got to the second line of abatis. One man of that regiment was kdled at the first line of abatis and rifle-pits ; then, at the second line, the battle became fierce and bloody. The confederates maintained a bold front from behind their breastworks, and when the Seventy-sixth was within fifty yards of the redoubt, they suffered severely from the confederate musketry and artidery. While a part of the regiment maintained a spirited fire, the rest crossed the abatis. Lieut. Wm. F. Kenaga was shot through a leg at the second abatis, and nearer the works was hit in the ankle-joint of his other leg ; then, unable to walk, he kept upright on his knees and rallied and cheered the men. The color-sergeant, Hussey, was killed within twenty feet of the works ; then the colors were taken by the noble and brave Corporal Goldwood, who, as he was planting them on the parapet, received the contents of three muskets so close that the discharge burnt his clothes, and he fed dead inside the works Avith the colors in his arms. The Seventy-sixth and the confederates were now fighting across the works, and those of the regiment in the rear were coming up as fast as they could pass the obstructions. Col. Busey ran along close to the parapet, and, with his revolver, disabled the gunner of a howitzer about to be fired, and which"], [229, "205 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. afterward proved to have a double charge of grape and can ister ; then turning to the right, he exchanged shots with two at short range. Afterward, he ordered Lieut.-Col. Jones, with Capts. Hughes and Ingerson, and Lieut. Warner, with from twenty to fifty men, to charge the right flank of the redoubt, whde he, with another squad, charged the front. They charged with bayonets, and drove the confederates from the works. Fdty yards in rear of the redoubt the ground began to slope considerably. It had been cleared of thick underbrush, and the latter had been pded in a row along the crest. Behind that cover the confederates formed again, and gave another volley, wounding, among others, Col. Busey and Capt. Hughes. Then the Seventh-sixth charged them again, and they threw down their arms, and ran into the woods and toward the landing. Col. Busey sent detachments in pursuit of them. Upward of four hunched prisoners fell into the possession of the Seventy- sixth. It had five men kided inside the works. Its whole num- ber of killed was sixteen, of whom, besides those already men- tioned, were Sergeant Perkins and Corporals Hopkins and Tremain. There were eighty wounded, some mortally ; so that its entire casualties were about one hundred. Among the wounded were Lieuts. Martin and Warner. The Seventy-sixth Illinois entered the works over the south sahent of the redoubt, and over the breastworks extending south. Its national colors were planted on the breastwork. It was claimed by his com- rades that Private Eldrick Bromdlet, of Company D, was the first one of the regiment over the works. He was kided fifty yards inside the works by a confederate captain, and the latter was kdled by Bromidet's comrade. That regiment used the bayonet in the charge, and displayed throughout the highest degree of valor. No regiment on the field that day suffered so heavily, none exhibited more intrepid bravery. And higher praise than that cannot be awarded troops."], [230, "206 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE The Twenty-fourth Indiana entered the works on the right of the Seventy-sixth Blinois, soon after the latter had pos session. The right of the Twenty-fourth had to pass one or two deep ravines, in which was wet ground covered with fallen trees, and, when part way to the confederate works, the regi ment was halted, and ordered to he down. But such was the ardor of the men, that theh commander found it difficult to restrain them, and bade them go on. Such was their ardor they did not stop to capture the confederate skirmishers, nor even to disarm ad they met. One of the latter raised his hands, to indicate his submission, and after the Twenty-fourth men had passed him turned and fired on them, grazing the ear of a man named Messer. The latter then turned upon him, and shot him dead. A man named Walker, in Company C, had told his comrades where he would fad, and after they had passed the spot they looked back, and saw that he was indeed lying there. A shed burst right over the Twenty-fourth, enveloping the men in a cloud of smoke, yet doing no more serious injury than tearing to pieces the hat of one man, the cartridge-box of another, and the stock of another's musket. However, the confederates thought it had done more mischief, and raised a cheer. The loss of the Twenty-fourth was about twelve, killed and wounded. Not far from the works, fed the lamented Capt. George E. Merchant, commanding Company D. He lived only tid the next day. He was an excellent officer, and dearly beloved by his company and comrades. The Ninety-seventh Illinois b#d pushed forward over the obstructions, against a dreadful fire, and, having started de ployed as skirmishers, the men got much scattered ; but they well knew how to take care of themselves, and officers and men performed their duty with unflinching valor. The colors of the regiment were planted on the works between the Stockton road and the redoubt south of it, almost simultaneously with the"], [231, "207 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Eighty-third Ohio. They were carried by Sergeant Edwin D. Lowe, and in the charge they were struck and torn by the fire of the artillery, but, unharmed himsed, he kept them con spicuously in the advance, and, undismayed by the thick dangers around him, planted them firmly on the works, then fed with a mortal wound. But the hand that struck him down was soon itsed laid cold, by an unerring shot from one of the color-guard. The Ninety-seventh Illinois lost nine kided and fifty-three wounded. Among the latter were five officers. Capt. Howard and Lieut. Orem were both struck down when near the main works. The loss in the Sixty-ninth Indiana battalion was ten, wounded. Col. Spiceley and staff entered the works about with the Twenty-fourth. The right of the Eighty-third Ohio had three ravines to pass, and the raAine nearest the garrison works was deep and long enough to include nearly the whole of the regiment. When it had advanced about tAvo hundred yards, it had come to the principal fine of confederate rifle-pits, stdl to some extent oc cupied. The Eighty-third there paused a few moments for the right to get up out of the ravine ; the confederate sharp shooters' guns were taken from those who surrendered, and broken. Then the colors of the Eighty-third moved on the line stdl advancing as fast as the nature of the ground and the obstacles of brush and logs would admit. It soon began to descend the ravine two hunched yards from the main works, and for two or three long minutes was lost sight of. It was passing the ravine through which ran a rivulet, and in the bot tom of which was a jungle of slashings almost defying the pas sage of persons even at a time of leisure and unencumbered with weapons. Then it began to ascend the high ground in front of the redoubt where were some detached rifle-pits. A feAv steps farther and it was up to another line of abatis, breast high, apparently impassable, and fifty yards from the works."], [232, "208 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Before this the foremost of the Eighty-third stooped doAvn to avoid the destructive fire which was being poured upon them, to take breath, and to wad till the wings could close up. Fd teen yards inside of the hne of abatis just before them was another dne, not readily seen at a distance, consisting of stakes firmly driven into the ground close together, and sharpened at the end. Then, thirty-five yards from that, was the ditch and the high parapet of the redoubt. The infantry troops which manned that redoubt and the adjacent breastworks, consisted of Cockred's Missouri brigade, comprising the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Missouri infantry, and the First and Third Missouri cavalry, dismounted ; one of the most famous fighting brigades of the confederate army. These troops stood up in a bold man ner behind theh breastworks, firing on their assadants as d they hoped to repulse them. There seemed to be a constant blaze of musketry along the breastworks. The artidery was served with the same desperate energy. The guns vomited forth grape and canister with a fury that made one shudder. But most of the shots went over the mark. Whde the Eighty-third Ohio was in that position the Sixty ninth Indiana and Ninety-seventh Idinois were on theh right, on loAver ground, near the Stockton road, and hotly engaged. Lieut. Col. Baldwin caused part of his regiment to return the fire of the garrison while the rest made an opening through the abatis. The colors of the regiment were flying conspicuously, and both flagstaffs were shot in two and the colors riddled with budets. While this scene was occurring, a division staff-officer was sent to have the Twenty-fourth Indiana move down to reinforce the Ninety-seventh Blinois, whose colors were seen not far from the main works ; but the Twenty-fourth was aheady on the way to the works farther to the right, and the officer found it inside of them. About the same time, another staff-officer was sent to"], [233, "209 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. hasten forward the main line of the Thhd brigade in support of the Eighty-third Ohio ; but before he reached its commander, it was advancing on the double-quick, the colors flying, the men cheering, and the whole line looking splendidly. On the right, was the Thirty-fourth Iowa, Col. G. W. Clark ; next the One Hunched and Fourteenth Ohio, Col. J. H. Kelly ; the Thirty seventh Blinois, Col. Chailes Black ; and the Twentieth Iowa, Lieut.-Col. J. B. Leake ; ad superior regiments, with gadant and able commanders. Their appearance on the field, of course, began to excite dismay in those against whom the Eighty-third was contending. Lieut.-Col. Baldwin, as soon as a passage was opened through the abatis, gave the order for the regiment again to advance. This was done with a dauntless sphit. The men, with theh bayonets, pried an opening through the next line of abatis, then rushed forward, bearing their flying colors, and, though still encountering numerous obstructions, in the nature of wire hnes, were soon upon the redoubt. Capt. Garry, of the Eighty-third, was among the first to mount the parapet, but a private soldier is said to have been the first over them. Lieut.-Col. Baldwin was soon on the parapet ; and see ing that the most of his regiment was ready to mount the works, he jumped down inside, and cried out, \" Surrender !\" The com manding officer inquired, \" To whom do we surrender ?\" Bald win answered, \" To the Eighty-third Ohio.\" Then the officer said, \" I beheve we did that once before,\" \u2014 referring to a some what simdar occasion at Vicksburgh. It was about twenty minutes from the time the Eighty-third began the charge tid it was in possession of the works ; but some contest was kept up for a few minutes in rear of the redoubt after the first had entered. Two vodeys were fired inside the works, in the edge of the woods, five minutes after the Eighty-third was inside. The loss of the Eighty-thhd Ohio was seven killed and twenty- 11"], [234, "210 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. one wounded. Among the kdled were Corporal Hughes, and Privates De Mar (on the works), Cook, Cox, Anderson, and Van Amsdale. Among the wounded were Capt. Gary and Lieut. Snycler. The other regiments of Moore's brigade met with some resist ance. The Thirty-fourth Iowa had three killed, and twelve wounded. The brigade commander advanced in the charge near that regiment. A man of Company H, of the Thirty fourth, was shot at by a wounded confederate lying in a rifle pit, having been passed by the skirmishers. Another man, of Company H, then dealt him a fatal blow with his clubbed musket. The loss in the Thirty-seventh Illinois was one kdled and three wounded. In the One Hundred and Fourteenth Ohio, two wounded. The Twentieth Iowa escaped loss in the assault, and only had its flag shot through. That regiment entered the works at the two-gun battery, on the brow of the ravine, south of Bedoubt No. 4. About eight hundred prisoners were taken in front of Moore's brigade. The whole number of prisoners taken by the Second division was thirteen hundred, including a general commanding a division ; also ten or twelve guns and several stands of colors. The works carried, in its front, were three quarters of a mde in extent, and embraced two strong redoubts (Nos. 3 and 4) and a two-gun battery. After dark, whde the men were picking up the dead and wounded, a few torpedoes were exploded. In this way a man of the Second Connecticut battery and one of the One Hunched and Fourteenth Ohio were kdled, and one or two others wounded. The whole loss of the Second division in the assault was two hundred and thirty-three, namely : forty-one kided and one hundred and ninety-two wounded. The con federate loss in killed and wounded, in front of that division was not fully ascertained. About twenty confederates were buried near the works."], [235, "211 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Veatch's Division.\u2014 Next, on the left, in Veatch's division, Dennis' brigade had the advance, the Third brigade, Lieut.-Col. Kinsey commanding, being held in reserve. Slack's brigade was not caded out of camp, it having been on duty the preceding night in going to and returning from Spanish fort. Gen. Dennis' brigade was disposed as fodows : The Eighth Illinois (Ogelsby's old regiment), a veteran and splendid regiment, Col. Sheetz commanding, was in the advance parallel. The Eleventh Illi nois (veteran), Col. Coats commanding, was to fodow in support in line of battle on the left, and the Forty-sixth Blinois, Col. Domblaser, on the right. Col. Sheetz was instructed to advance, with the Eighth Blinois deployed as skirmishers, as soon as he saw the troops moving in the assault on his right and left. At the moment the Eighth Blinois advanced, the Eighty third Ohio had got about halfway to the main works. The line of the Eighth Blinois, deployed in one rank, extended about four hunched yards. The regiment numbered seven hun dred. The chstance to the confederate works was six hundred yards. There was first a slight ravine to pass, and then the ground was moderately level ; but the course of the right of the line lay over the irregularly-scalloped side of a deep ravine. There were two or three lines of abatis to overcome, and the ground was partly covered with faden trees. There was also some obstruction by wires. Yet that, including a strip of ground adjoining on the left, was, perhaps, the smoothest part of the field of Blakely, and it was, perhaps, the most exposed. The Eighth Blinois took up the soldiers' war-cry, and rushed forward in the charge with all the compulsive force that a skirmish-line can have. They made but short pause at the confederate rifle-pits. Those of the occupants who did not fad back rapidly to theh main works, were kided or captured. The abatis was passed, either by springing over it, or by puding"], [236, "212 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. it one side and making passage ways through it. The nearer the Eighth got to the main works, the fiercer raged the tempest of budets against them. Besides a constant volume of mus ketry, they encountered the rapid fire of four pieces of artidery. They returned the fire to some extent. Meantime the besiegers' batteries in their rear were dropping sheds on the garrison's works with excedent effect. When within about a hundred yards of the main works, the contest seemed desperate, and it was apparent the Eighth Avas losing many. The Eleventh and Forty-sixth had got halfway over the field, moving in a gal lant manner, when an order reached them to halt, the right of Garrard's division having been seen to pause. Then the orderly, Murray, who carried the order, went on with a simdar one to the Eighth, but the latter, with victorious strides, was already on the parapets of the redoubt, and the brave orderly entered the works close by Lieut.-Col. Wheaton, of the Eighth. The latter and Sergt. John SAvitzer, of Com pany B, were the first of the regiment upon the works. A shot from one of the besiegers' batteries struck the parapet while Wheaton was going over the works ; and whde he was close to the parapet, two men of the Eighth were killed by the last artidery fire from the redoubt. Wheaton ordered Sergt. Switzer to shoot the gunner ; but before it could be done, Sergt. Henderson had struck him down with the butt of his musket. Capt Mdler entered several yards to the left of Wheaton. and Private James B. Garwood, of his company, was shot down by his side when on the top of the works. Capt. Mdler there encountered an officer of the garrison, who attempted to shoot him with a revolver, and took him prisoner. Then seeing their flag, which was planted in the ground that the bearer might better assist in the defence, he tore it from the staff.

As soon as the Eleventh and Forty-sixth had come up, the Eighth moved down toward the landing. Veatch's loss in the assault was thirteen killed and sixty-four wounded. Of these the Eighth Blinois lost ten killed and fifty-four wounded. Among the severely wounded of the Eighth were Capt. Coleman \u2014 -who, after having been brought to the ground, continued to wave his sword and cheer his men \u2014 also Lieuts. Sanderson and Harrington. In Veatch's front were captured about three hundred prison ers, one thirty-pounder Parrott, one ten-pounder Parrott, two twelve-pounder howitzers, and one Vin-inch columbiad.

Binaker's), and left of the Third brigade (Col. Harris'), of this division, being the nearest point to the confederate works, Gen. Garrard directed that the assault in his front shoidd commence there, and be taken up on the right and left. His order of attack was two dnes of skhmishers, to be supported by the main line of battle. When the first skhmish line had started, and appeared to be advancing with success, the second line was to follow, and when the first line had reached the enemy's works, the main line was to charge. This plan was adopted by him on account of the terrible obstructions in his front. His three brigades were in position at about the appointed hour. Col. Binaker, assisted by his acting aide-de-camp, Lieut. McLain, of the Eighty-ninth Indiana, had been arrang ing the position of his brigade, and was about ready to give the order to advance, when the commander of the Third Indiana light battery reported to him for orders. This caused him a dttle delay, and his brigade did not move precisely with Harris'."], [240, "214 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Col. Harris' brigade was formed in two lines. In the first line, the Fdty-eighth Illinois, Capt. John Murphy commanding, was on the right ; the Eleventh Wisconsin, Maj. J. S. Mdler, on the left ; the One Hundred and Seventy-eighth New York, Lieut.-Col. J. B. Gondado, in the centre. In the second line, the Thirty-fourth New Jersey, Col. Lawrence, was on the right ; and the Fdty-second Indiana, Lieut.-Col. Main, on the left. Company A, Capt. Park, Company F, Lieut. McConned, and Company D, Capt. Toms, of the Eleventh Wisconsin, were selected for the skirmish-line of that regiment, and they deployed and lay down in front of the trench previous to the movement. These troops had to charge six hundred yards (more than one third of a mde), over broken ground, covered Avith the usual amount of obstructions. At quarter to six o'clock, Col. Harris directed his acting assistant adjutant-gen eral, Capt. B. E. Jackson, of the Eleventh Wisconsin, to order the charge to commence ; which order was soon given, and promptly obeyed. When the skirmish-line of the Eleventh had gained one hundred yards, they received such a heavy fire from the confederates' wed-fortified and numerously manned pits, that Maj. Miller, fearing they would be checked, took the responsibility of ordering forward the rest of his regiment, com manding, \" Forward, Eleventh !\" Instantly the Eleventh Wis consin sprang out of their trench, and, with the ringing cheers of veterans, rushed onward, with emulous ardor and high resolve, to victory or death. They fodowed so closely upon the retreating confederate skhmishers, as to save them selves from a general fire from the main works tid within about one hundred yards of them. Then they encountered a destructive fire of musketry, and grape, and canister. Though many were struck down, and the ranks of the leading groups were visibly thinned, the survivors moved on with unfaltering step to the main works, and there engaged"], [241, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 215 in a hand-to-hand contest with the most unyielding spirits of the garrison. Lieut. Angus B. McDonald, Sergeant Daniel B. Moore, and six others, were within thirty yards of the works, and. by Lieut. McDonald's orders, they fixed bayo- nets, and charged them. When close to the parapet a vol- ley kided fiAre of their number, and knocked the lock off of Moore's gun. Then McDonald ordered that they should wait till others came up ; but Sergeant Moore, in the din, not hearing the order, mounted the works. The gallant Corporal Joel Wheeler, of Company A, had preceded him and was shot dead on the parapet. McDonald quickly fodowed and demanded a surrender. At that time the main part of the Eleventh was coming up within a few yards, but one or two vodeys were afterward fired on them from behind the works. A portion of the garrison had aheady broke and was fleeing toward the landing. Where McDonald and Moore entered were eight who surrendered ; but ten yards to theh right was a squad of twelve under charge of an officer, who were stdl pouring a deadly fire into the right of the Eleventh. The officer exclaimed : \" No quarter to the d d Yankees.\" Lieut. McDonald and Sergeant Moore fed into theh hands, and then followed a desperate struggle. Five or six attacked McDonald with bayonets, but he fought them with his sword, knocking some down, and kdled two. He received two bayonet thrusts in his breast and a musket bad in his thigh, when he fed. A confederate fed over him whom he used as a shield against a farther thrust by the bayonet. Then Sergeant Moore, who had also received a bayonet wound, picked up a confederate musket and shot McDonald's assadant dead. Other gallant men of the Eleventh were soon upon the works, closely fodowed by the regiment. Then came with eager step the rest of the brigade with its commander, Col. Harris ; and when the troops were in full possession of the works a shout of"], [242, "216 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. triumph went up that baffles description. The men flocked around their commander with earnest and joyful greetings. But no single voice could be heard. Col. Harris pointed up to the flag, now proudly waving on the captured works. Then again the emotions of patriotism and of victory burst forth in tumultuous shouts. Near them the ground was thickly strewed with the wounded and the dead, and many of the latter were buried near the works. Among the kdled in the Eleventh Wis consin, were Lieut. Bichard Codded, Sergeant W. H. Phelps, and Corporals Wheeler, Adbaugh, Shea, and Ingamills. Its whole number of kdled was fifteen, and it had two commissioned officers, including Lieut. Wm. Charlton, twelve non-commis sioned officers, and thirty-two privates wounded. Total casual ties in the Eleventh Wisconsin, sixty-one. In the Fdty-eighth Illinois, Lieut. Thomas Madoy was kdled on the works, and Lieut. Atwater severely wounded ; and there were other casual ties in that regiment. In the One Hundred and Seventy-eighth New York, there was one kided and four wounded ; in the Fifty second Indiana two kdled and eight wounded ; in the Thirty fourth New Jersey, Corporal Hampton was kdled and three were wounded. Soon after the works in Harris' front were taken, detachments of his brigade marched clown to the landing for prisoners. The Fdty-second Indiana was placed as guard over the artillery and prisoners. Simdar enthusiasm and gadantry characterized Gen. Gilbert's brigade, next on the right, which advanced soon after Harris'. It was formed in three lines. The Tenth Kansas, Lieut.-Col. Charles S. Hdls commanding, and Company B, of the Twenty seventh Iowa, deployed as skhmishers in the advanced trench, six hundred yards from the main works. The Twenty-seventh Iowa, Col. Lake ; the One Hundred and Seventeenth Illinois, Col. Moore, and Companies D, H, and K, of the Thirty-second"], [243, "217 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Iowa, under Maj. Hutchinson, in the second line. The Sixth Minnesota, Lieut.-Col. Grant, and the other seven companies of the Thirty-second Iowa, Lieut.-Col. Eberhart, forming the reserve line, and posted eleven hunched yards from the main works. The severest part of the charge fed upon the Tenth Kansas, and they breasted the storm that beat against them with a noble heroism. In their front, as elsewhere, the artidery uttered its last fierce thunders, pouring forth shed, grape, and canister ; the musketry vodeys roded along the line in quick succession, and clouds of smoke rose up from the works. The Tenth Kansas directed their steps toward the Sixth redoubt ; yet such was the fire upon them, and not wishing to pause to return it, they turned for a moment clown the side of a ravine. But an enfilading fire greeted them there ; and with hardly a pause, they soon gained the high ground again, crossed two lines of abatis, then the ditch, and mounted the parapets. The furious fire that had beset them, made them cluster in a group, and they entered the works more as a column in mass than in line. Then, with fixed bayonets, they swept along the works to theh right, mixing blue and gray to gether ; and the latter, seeing theh helpless condition, hud dled into the angles of the fort, and making little resistance, surrendered by scores. Yet there was some firing after the Tenth were inside the works, for a number of the confederates refused to surrender. One captain caught up a musket and fired at Capt. Wood, of the Tenth, whde the latter was calling on him to surrender, and then another, and a third musket, each time faihng to hit Capt. Wood. Then Corporal Schidtz, of the Tenth, sent a bad through the confederate's head, and he fed. Several other instances of the same kind occurred. Meantime, some of the leading confederate officers were approaching officers of the Tenth, handing them their swords, and beseeching them to stop the"], [244, "218 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. \"butchery,\" as they termed it. But it appears none were intentionally kdled after they had ceased fighting. The con federate commanders were not able to get ad to surrender, even after resistance seemed utterly fruitless. A number of pieces of artillery and several hunched prison ers were captured in Gdbert's front. The Tenth Kansas had seven kided and twelve wounded, and of the latter, Lieut. John Bryan and Private Plummer died of theh wounds. Among the kided were Sergeant George Daller and Corporals Buxton and Thompson. There were four wounded in the Twenty-seventh Iowa, including Lieut. Eisenhart ; one kdled and one wounded in the One Hundred and Seventeenth Illinois ; one wounded in the Sixth Minnesota, and one in the Thirty-second Iowa. The whole loss in Gdbert's brigade was eight killed and nineteen wounded. After the brigade was in possession of the works, large detachments hurried down to the landing, and through the woods, for prisoners. Maj. Hutchinson, of the Thirty-second Iowa, with a squad of eight men, held a large number of confederates in check, in range of their gunboats, in a manner to prevent the latter from firing on the Union troops. Binaker's brigade had from three hundred to four hundred yards of rough ground to charge over, before reaching the confederate works. The One Hundred and Nineteenth Blinois, Col. Thomas J. Kinney, deployed as skhmishers, commenced the charge in front of that brigade, advancing with cheers, on the run, at a signal by the bugle. The supporting line con sisted of the Eighty-ninth Indiana on the right, the One Hun dred and Twenty-second Blinois in the centre, and the Twenty first Missouri on the left. Lieut.-Col. Craven, of the Eighty ninth Incdana, had accompanied the regiment down to the front, although id, but was not able to take part in the charge, and the command fed upon Major Winter. At the second"], [245, "219 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. signal on the bugle, these three regiments advanced with eager step. The most of the One Hundred and Nineteenth was then only thirty yards in front ; and the ground was so irregular, and the obstacles so numerous, that both lines were soon merged together. Yet the latter regiment pushed forward as fast as men could go, stopping to fire but little. The greater part of the confederates retreated from theh rifle-pits to the main works, and it seemed to be a race between them and the assault- ing troops as to which should reach them first. A vehement and excited fire from the main works assaded the advancing troops, the artillery of two redoubts being turned upon them. Yet the guns did less injury than was to have been apprehended. Each regiment sustained some loss. Lieut.-Col. Drish, of the One Hundred and Twenty-second, fed struck by a piece of shed, and the command devolved on Major Chapman. Two of that regiment, named Mider, were kided, and eleven wounded. In the Eighty -ninth Indiana, one \u2014 Corporal Cowan \u2014 was kdled, and five wounded, two of whom, Hutchinson and Coppock, died. The color-bearer of the Twenty-first Missouri was shot down when near the works, and they were seized by Cox of Company G, One Hundred and Twenty-second Illinois, and planted on the works. The loss in the One Hundred and Nineteenth was sixteen kdled and wounded \u2014 and the most of those casualties occurred in Capt. Hubbard's company, and his brother, Edward P. Hubbard, a private soldier, was among the mortady wounded. Some twenty of that company charged the works with fixed bayonets, and were among the first to enter them. As Binaker's brigade got close to the works, the most of the infantry \u2014 Alabama reserves \u2014 retreated toward the river. The artillerists, however, held theh positions, and, refusing to surrender, were shot. Many of the artiderists were armed with rifles. After entering the works, the Twenty-first Missouri and Capt. Bostwick's company, of the One Hunched aud Twenty-"], [246, "220 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. second Illinois, turned to the left and charged down in rear of the works to the last redoubt. Binaker's brigade took three or four battle-flags, the artidery in theh front, and several hundred prisoners. The redoubts in Garrard's front had eighteen embrasures, and his division carried all the works in its front, capturing the artidery, and sixteen hundred prisoners, including two general officers. The loss in his division was : commissioned officers, two killed and seven wounded ; enlisted men, thirty-nine killed and one hundred and seventeen wounded ; total, one hunched and sixty-five. The total casualties of the federals, engaged in the assault, was one hundred and twenty-seven killed and five fiundred and twenty-seven wounded ; grand total, six hundred and fifty-four. Number of prisoners captured, three thousand four hunched and twenty-three, including three general officers. There'were also captured, several battle-flags, upward of forty pieces of artillery, the small arms used by the infantry, and ad the gar rison stores. It is not easy to estimate the loss of the garrison in kdled and wounded ; but it was probably a thhd as large as that of the besiegers. There were a few boats out in the stream, and some of the garrison attempted to swim to them, and it was reported a number were droAvned. Wellington wed said that a battle could not be painted. Neither can language fudy describe so great and ever-chang ing a scene. It has been seen what was the nature of the ground over which the assault was made ; that it was cut up by ravines, rough, and covered with obstructions. It was known, also, to be mined with torpedoes in various places ; and there was reason to dread them. Thirty-five regiments\u2014 fully sixteen thousand troops\u2014 partici-"], [247, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 221 pated in the assault. The lines were three miles in length, and the advance of the entire line was remarkably simultaneous. The scene was picturesque and grand. From different points of view the assaulting hnes could be seen for a mile or two, as far even as the forms of men could be distinguished moving over the broken ground. The regimental colors, though not in perfect line, were steadily advancing, and the troops were dash ing on over and through the obstructions like a stormy wave. It was at a moment when the shock of battle was the fiercest. In the clamor could be heard the voices of the assaulting troops. Nothing could exceed their enthusiasm. If then they could have known the great event that had occurred a few hours before \u2014 that Lee had surrendered \u2014 and that their contest would probably be the last important struggle of the war, they could hardly have experienced more exulting emotions, or pressed forward with more dauntless step. It seemed as if \" all the joy, ad the sensation of lde, was in that one moment, that they cast themselves with the fierce gladness of mountain torrents, head long on that brief revehy of glory.\" Gen. Steele, during the assault, was along the front of the Second division, and, with his staff, kept np with the main line of Moore's brigade. When he saw the advance line entering the works, he exclaimed : \" I knew they would do it. I told you they would go over those works.\" He soon after sat down, and signed a despatch to Gen. Canby, which Capt. Lacy, his assistant adjutant-general, had written, in these words : \" We have stormed the enthe line of works, and our troops are now in frdl possession.\" A reply soon came, written by Col. Christensen, saying : \" Gen Canby says : ' God bless you, and God bless your brave command.' \" It was dark before the prisoners could be collected together and formed to march back with the different divisions to their camps ; and great care had to be taken to avoid dangers from"], [248, "222 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. torpedoes. Ad the fore part of that night, there were occa sional explosions of torpedoes, and a few men were kdled by them whde searching for the dead and wounded. It was a discordant and melancholy sound to hear."], [249, "CHAPTER XXIV. OBSERVATIONS ON THE SIEGE AND ASSAULT OF BLAKELY. 1. The fall of Blakely, and capture of its garrison, left the con federates only four thousand five hundred troops for the imme diate defence of Mobde, which being too smad a force to hold the city, they marched, on the 11th, for Meridian. Gen. Maury fodoAved at daydght of the 12th. Canby, by signals, learned of the evacuation of the city the evening of the 11th, and had troops immediately in motion for its occupation. Granger, with the First and Third divisions of his corps, embarked on transports at Stark's landing, at daylight of the 12th, and, with a portion of the squadron, under Thatcher, crossed over the bay, landing two mdes below the city, and entered it unopposed. The Third division marched on to Whist ler's station, and overtook and skirmished with the rear-guard of the confederate column. It was not Gen. Canby's purpose, under any circumstances, to besiege Mobde from the land side. H the city had held out longer, he would have moved across the head of the bay, b}' means of transports and pontoons, and estabdshed batteries on the islands in front of the city. And some steps toward such a movement had aheady been taken. 2. The conduct of the garrison of Blakely is, on the whole, de serving of commendation. The troops manifested much energy and spirit during the siege, often making bold salhes in the night, and disturbing the besiegers. They were expecting an assault about the time it took place, and felt considerable confi-"], [250, "224 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. dence they could repulse it. Had an assault been made before the fad of Spanish fort, it would probably have been more bloody, though not repulsed ; for the garrison would have had more hope in resisting. But, after they knew that fifteen or twenty thousand more troops had come up from Spanish fort (these, however, were two miles in the rear in theh camps), they had reason to feel that the odds against them were too great for successful resistance. The assaulting troops had the moral reinforcement of the Spanish fort troops. The garrison had a large number of sharpshooters or skh mishers in pits three hundi'ed yards in front of theh main works. These had an opportunity to fire only one or two rounds, and then fed back ; but there being no covered way, and not being able, on account of the obstacles, to move rapidly, they were for a short time a sort of cover to the assaulting troops, embarrassing, if not preventing, the fire of those behind the main works. If, instead of being three hun dred yards to the front, they had been in pits fifty yards in front, with approaches to the main works, a double line of musketry fire could then have been poured on the assaulting troops just as they were reaching the most difficult abatis. The rules for defending fortifications require the garrison to mount the parapet when they find the assaulting troops are attacking closely. This does not appear to have been clone anywhere on the line. 3. But it was a mistake to keep the garrison at Blakely an hour after the fad of Spanish fort. Every possible means should have been used to remove it before an assault could be made. But Gen. Maury adeges : \" It would have been difficult to do this after day dawned, and up to that time ad of Span ish fort garrison had not been transferred from Blakely to Mobile.\" 4. Gen. Maury, in an account which he wrote of the siege,"], [251, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 225 makes the just remark, that \"the marshes about Mobile, as marshes almost everywhere else, produced a greater moral effect upon besiegers and besieged than facts justified.\" On account of the existence of a swamp on the left of the besiegers, the investment of Blakely was not complete on that flank to within four or five hundred yards. The swamp was narrow, and could have been bridged, and there was no good excuse for the investment being incomplete. 5. Whether the time for the assault was favorable, is an interesting question, and wid doubtless be answered affirma tively. The troops engaged in it had the moral support of the presence of the rest of the army which had come from Spanish fort. When the garrison saw the assaulting lines advancing, they felt that the woods behind them were also full of troops ; for they had heard of heavy columns moving over Minette bayou. Suppose the assault had taken place the day before? Is it not probable the resistance would have been greater ? They certainly would have had more hope of effect ing a repulse. As it was, the general assault was not repulsed at any point. It is probable Gen. Steele would not have ordered a general assault for two or three days longer had it not been for the fad of Spanish fort, such was the distance \u2014 from five to six hundred yards \u2014 to charge over. But it perhaps saved lde that the assault was made from the third paradel, and without waiting till a fourth was dug. The besiegers had come upon torpedoes in their digging, and doubtless many hves would have been lost by farther extending the approaches and trenches. After the assault, it Avas ascertained the advance trench, on the right of the Second division, ran between two rows of torpedoes! 6. The besiegers deserve commendation for the amount of work they performed. Aud, it should be remarked, that not one of their number was captured. Yet, unauestionably, more work lo"], [252, "226 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. might have been performed ; for there are few operations in which the energy and industry of men are exhausted. Each division constructed its works according to its own plans, and with but little, d any, outside professional assistance. Several mdes of trenches and approaches were made, and they wdl long remain as proof of the labor that was done. Over the field of Blakely the bushes are beginning to grow up, and in a few years another forest wdl no doubt cover the ground. But many of the trenches will remain. The storms of centuries wdl not wear them away."], [253, "CHAPTER XXV. REDUCTION OF FORTS HUGER AND TRACT. Forts Huger and Tracy held out three days after the fad of Spanish fort. They were not days of quiet. Guns were now turned on them from McDermett and old Spanish fort. The Octorara approached nearer and dehvered a more unerring aud efl'ective fire. The old and a new battery on Bay Minette shore also hurled against them a copious shower of heavy projectdes. Both those forts replied with sphit. Their garrisons expected soon to evacuate, and were lavish of ammunition. April 9. \u2014 Capt. Foust's battery (First Missouri) moved into old Spanish fort, unspiked two one-hundred-pounder Brooks' rifles, and opened them on Huger. In the evening one of them was bursted. Another one-hundred-pounder Parrott, under Lieut. Parker (Fhst Indiana), was put in the Bay Minette shore battery, making two there of that calibre, which were also engaged. On the north shore of that bayou, batteries were begun for two more one-hundred-pounder rifles and four thirty-pounder rifles. The Navy. \u2014 At twenty minutes past one, A. M., the squadron observed hghts in Old Spanish fort, and tAventy minutes afterward they received a message through the army signal officer, that the works Avere evacuated. Torpedoes stdl held the navy in check ; but energetic efforts were being made to remove them. About one hundred and fifty had aheady been removed. A second net having been"], [254, "228 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. stretched across the channel, about a mile and a had above the first one, the intervening part of the channel was swept with chains, by tugs. At forty minutes past three, p. m., the Octorara and ironclads weighed and stood over the first net, steamed up to the second, and came to anchor a thousand yards below Old Spanish fort. The tad reeds on the marsh so obstructed the view of Huger, that range-stakes were neces sary for pointing the guns ; and as the reeds would not burn, men were sent on shore with poles, and a lane was beaten, through which the fort could be seen. The Octorara now opened fire on Huger with her hundred pounder Parrott, at a distance of five thousand four hundred yards \u2014 a httle upward of three miles ! Her first shots fell short. Some of the Spanish fort garrison had not yet got away from Huger ; the noise of the Octorara's sheds were famd iar to them, and they joymdy congratulated themselves when they saw them fall short. Soon, however, a shell came and plunged into the river, three hundred yards above the fort. The next one struck the very centre of the works, making theh boggy foundations rock and tremble (to use the expression of one who was there) like a ship in a gale of wind. The sub sequent shots told with good effect on their bombproofs. One man was kided. The confederates thought the Octorara's gun was served with remarkable skid. It was a saying among them that it must be served by \"one-eyed Brannegan,\" a famous gunner and deserter from theh service. They considered indeed that it was handled with skid surpassing that of Sergeant Bonner, of the TAventy second Louisiana regiment, who was celebrated in the confede rate service for his efficiency in that respect. The captain of this hundred-pounder gun on the Octorara, and who fired every round, was James Welsch, chief boatswain's mate, an old . man-of-war's man. He was subsequently dis-"], [255, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 229 charged at the end of his three-years term of service. His skid was remarkable, and there should be inducements for such men to remain hi the navy. The gun itsed was a navy-Parrott rifle, manufactured at the West Point foundry, under the supervision of its designer. Eighty-pound Parrott shells were fired from it, with the reduced charge of eight pounds of powder. April 10. \u2014 The morning of the 10th was thick, and a shell fired at daylight, showed that it was best to suspend the fire. At half past nine, it was resumed in reply to guns which had opened on the Mustang, hi which Gen. Bailey had gone up to Spanish fort, and continued slowly for two hours. At forty minutes past one, p. M., the guns of Huger were firing on the squadron's boats, which were sweeping for torpedoes; and the Octorara again opened fire iu reply. But during the day she fired only seventy-three rounds. In course of the day the tug Glasgow came up with Commodore James S. Palmer on board, and being beyond signal distance from the Admiral's ship, his pendant as diA'isional commander, was hoisted. Lieut. Beardsley, with Company K, Sixth Michigan, moved into Old Spanish fort hi the forenoon, and relieved Capt. Foust. Besides serving the one hunched-pounder, Beardsley got a new thirty-pounder Parrott (made at Selma only a -few months before) in position and at work. At four, p. M., Capt. Foust com menced with two of his hght pieces, and at five, p. m., Beardsley got a tAventy-pounder Parrots unspiked and at Avork. All the whde the fire from Huger and Tracy was tremendous, for they were using more than a dozen heavy guns without mercy, and made it deathly hot around Old Spanish fort. A detachment of the Ninety-fourth Blinois opened fire with a thirty-pounder on McDermett. April 11. \u2014 Foust's battery had been firing ad night. At eleven o'clock of the same night, Lieut. Beardsley, with ten"], [256, "230 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. men of his company, got a hundred-pounder Brooks rifle mounted in McDermett on a new carriage the garrison had just procured, but not used. Much to his surprise, Beardsley found that the gun was spiked and shotted. They then worked tid it was just daylight, when they succeeded in blowing out the spike by firing the gun from the muzzle. They had scarcely lain down to get a little sleep when the guns from Huger opened on them. They then jumped up and returned the fire with the one-hunched-pounder. The firing continued heavy and grand through the day. It was the last day for great guns in Mobde bay \u2014 the last for the war. The smoke rolled up in cloudy columns. The bellowing peals reverberated far inland and far out upon the sea. Four thirty-pounders, from the north shore of Bay Minette, fired on Tracy. On the south shore, the two one-hundred-pounders, with the eight thirty-pounders of the First Indiana, were stdl engaged. Likewise the guns at Old Spanish fort, manned by Foust's company. During the day, a salute of one hundred shotted rounds was fired in honor of the national victories. Some twenty guns, in all, of the land batteries were delivering a destructive fire on those forts. A battery was also in progress on the north shore of Bay Minette for two one-hundred-pounders and four thirty-pounders. From Huger, shot after shot came in quick succession, ploughing up the ground about McDermett. One shot destroyed a wheel of a thirty-pounder, and six shots were buried in the magazine.' The Octorara was also engaged at intervals during the day with her one-hundred-pounder. In the evening, the guns of Huger and Tracy ceased their mighty roar, but not till the garrisons were ready to leave. In the evening, Gen. A. J. Smith, with a detachment of his corps, went down to the shore of Bay Minette, intending to move out in the night in boats and flats and carry Huger and Tracy by assault. About ten, p. M., a signal officer, with orders"], [257, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 231 from him, went to Armstrong's battery to have the firing cease. This being complied with, the officers soon after turned theh attention intently on those forts. As they sat peering through the darkness, with their glasses in the direction of Huger, they saw the glimmer of lanterns passing to and fro, and at about had-past ten, signal lights were seen. The indications were that the forts were being evacuated. At about nine in the evening, the first cutter of the Octorara, on picket just below Huger, fell in with a skiff that was pulhng down the river. In the skiff were eight men who represented themselves to be refugees and deserters from that fort. They said, in answer to questions, that Huger and Tracy had been hastily evacuated immediately after dark, and that the armament and ordnance stores had not been destroyed. This information was communicated to the officer in charge of the boats sweeping for torpedoes. A landing was made at the forts, and they were taken possession of by the officers and men of the boats. It seemed a happy and fitting circumstance that these forts should first come into the possession of the navy, not because the navy had done the most toward compelling theh evacuation, but because it had done ad it was possible to do, and in a good spirit. Yet, in the honors of victory ad, of course, have a share. It is seldom, if ever, that any particular organization has a right to claim them entire ; or to claim a specific share. This night the pontoniers happened to be on duty in those waters. They had come to take away the canvas bridge \u2014 the lower one on the bayou \u2014 and in some way, it seems, got knowledge of the evacuation and entered the forts themselves. The next day the guns in those forts had inscriptions on them to this effect : \" Eleven o'clock, p. m., April 11. Captured by the One Hundred and Fourteenth Illinois\" (pontoniers). Also, the names of individual soldiers. This was an excedent joke, and a fine sarcasm on those thoughtless men who would parcel"], [258, "232 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. out the honors of conquest. For pontoniers, though not expected to be the first inside a captured fort, have a share in the glory of the victory. Wednesday, April 12.\u2014 The channel was swept with chains, by tugs, and the Octorara and ironclads, preceded by the Glas gow, steamed up to the obstructions at Huger. The Glasgow passed through the gap. During the night, a boat from the Octorara went up the Blakely river to the Tensas, and ascer tained there were no other obstructions. At daylight on the 13th, the Octorara attempted to follow the Glasgow through the obstructions of the gap, but did not succeed. The channel was then blown out, and the wreck of a sunken scoav removed. At about noon, the Octorara and the ironclads steamed through the gap and through Tensas and Spanish rivers, anchoring off Mobde at about eight o'clock, p. m. Admiral Thatcher was already off Mobde, having the clay previous, with a portion of the squadron, accompanied Granger's forces across the bay from Stark's landing. A few days afterward the Sixteenth corps inarched rapidly to Montgomery. Steele, with his command, proceeded to the same place on transports, leaving, however, one division at Selma. The campaign may be said to have occupied twenty-two days.1 The result has been seen. The number of prisoners accounted for by Canby's provost-marshal general was four thousand nine hundred and twenty-four. His own loss in killed and wounded was fifteen hundred. 1 Strength of Canby's army in the field : Two divisions, and one brigade of Thirteenth corps, . 13,200 Sixteenth corps, 16,000 Engineers, artillery, and cavalry, 3,000 Total 32,200 Column under Steele, 13,200 Grand total, 45400"], [259, "CHAPTER XXVI. ADVENTURES AND INCIDENTS. The wheel of fortune does not always withhold its honors from those who, at obscure posts, are constant and faithful. During the siege of Spanish fort, the base of supphes for the army was at Stark' s landing. The commanding officer at a base, every one will admit, should be energetic, vigilant, and prudent. Wharves are to be built \u2014 labor day and night to be performed \u2014 ordnance and ammunition are to be received \u2014 vessels laden with proAisions and forage are to arrive and be promptly discharged \u2014 sick and wounded soldiers are to be put aboard vessels and sent off. Industry, good order, humanity, should prevail. The quartermaster and commissary have much responsibility, but the military commander present is also responsible that everything goes right. The officer in command at Stark's landing, also in command of the engineers, was Gen. Badey, wed-knoAvn for distinguished service in budding a dam on Bed river. Whde the insjjiring scenes of battle had been occurring some distance off, yet in his hearing, he had been performing the duties of a more secluded position. On the 9th of April, Gen. Canby being at Blakely, and anxious to get transports up to Spanish fort, inquired, through Gen. Osterhaus, chief of staff, by telegraph, of Bailey, if he could find some courageous captain, who would move up and try the channel ? Gen. Bailey repded, that he would try to find a captain of a"], [260, "234 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. vessel who would go ; but, that faihng to find one, he would go himself. Not long afterward he telegraphed again to Gen. Canby's headquarters, that the Mustang had come in, and that he would go up on her as soon as her freight was discharged, which was being rapidly done ; and inquired whether it would be better to go that evening or wait till morning. An answer promptly came, to wait tid morning ; and that the commanding general felt much regret that he had determined to go himsed on so perdous an adventure. On the morning of the 10th, Gen. Bailey, with his staff, Maj. G. Pien, Fourth Wisconsin cavahy, Capt. J. H. Meredith, Lieuts. Nolan, Hill, Martin, and Burdick, embarked on the Mustang. She was a steamer which had formerly ran on the Bio Grande, but was now about worn out. HaAing got into the channel, she soon passed the admiral's flag-ship, then, farther on, the monitors, and near them the three sunken ironclads, their hulls now just above the water. Some hundred yards more brought her to the first torpedo net. Her wheels stopped, and she glided over it. Half a mde farther they reached the Octorara, the advance gunboat, and there anchored. Gen. Badey, with some of his staff, and the captain of the Mustang, went aboard the Octorara, and pro cured information concerning the channel. He also learned the progress that had been made in taking up torpedoes ; and that there was scarcely any danger in a fight-draft boat, hke the Mustang (draAving only two and a half feet) going to Spanish fort landing ; as boats and tugs of the squadron, draw ing about as much, had been above there. He also learned that he would, in all probabidty, draw the fire of Fort Huger. The Mustang then steamed on up the river, and soon passed over the second net, from which several torpedoes had been taken the night before. After passing this, they had some cause to apprehend danger from floating torpedoes. But theh"], [261, "235 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. boats were ready to launch in case of accident. Finally, they reached the landing at Spanish fort in safety. On going ashore, Gen. Badey proceeded to the quarters of Col. Bertram ; and had been there but a few minutes, when a signal-officer came in and informed him that the commander at Tracy had ordered every gun of Huger to be \" brought to bear on that steamer, and, for G-d's sake, to sink her.\" At this announcement, Gen. Badey, and staff, hastened on board, to put back to Stark's landing. But the Mustang was slow in turning, and getting into the channel, and shot and shed were ad the whde coming from Huger. Forty-one were fired at the Mustang, a few striking her, but they caused no serious injury, though an explosion of one of the shells disagreeably be sprinkled some of the party with earth and sand. She got back safely to Stark's landing, having been gone four hours, and Bailey reported the result of his trip. The com manding general telegraphed the fodowing reply : \" Your inter esting report of the expedition to Spanish fort is received ; and the promptness and signal bravery displayed by you are highly appreciated.\" Incidents of the Siege. \u2014 Beckless exposure of fife in a siege commands no part of that applause which is earned by daring in its true sense. Yet, light censure wid be cast on such exam ples, considering the tendency for men to grow timid by long continued service in trenches. The daily history of every regiment in the siege would doubt less exhibit individual act3 of gallantry, and even of rashness, on the part of the enlisted men. On the second day of the siege, Company D, Seventh Minne sota, was on the skirmish-line in McArthur's front, and had approached, under cover of logs and stumps, to within about three hundred and fifty yards of the garrison's main line of works. Sergeants Vidito and Canfield, and Private Leighton,"], [262, "236 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. were farthest advanced, and in short nrusket-range of the con federates. They were each six foot high, and when they fired, would rise from behind a log, stand deliberately, and aim, dis charge their muskets, and watch to see the effect. It was only after repeated commands from theh captain that they became more cautious. The consequence of unnecessary exposure was more apt to be like what occurred in the folloAving case : On the 5th of April, a man of the Thirty-fifth Wisconsin persisted in standing on the bank in rear of the sunken battery of the Sixth Michigan. On being told by one of the men that he would be hit, replied : \" The ball isn't moulded yet that would hit me.\" Scarcely had the words been uttered when he received a bad through his right elbow ; a wound that lost the poor fedow his arm. When the annals of war are truly written, painful blunders are often disclosed, which repress the exultation of victory. The night Spanish fort was being evacuated, two federal soldiers, who had been for some time held as prisoners at Fort Tracy, managed, amid the darkness and confusion, to make their escape in a skiff. Beaching the main land, they moved cautiously along the shore ; but some of the federals having followed down after the retreating garrison, heard the rustling of the bushes, and thinking it was some straggling confederates, chadenged them to surrender. Presuming the demand came from confederates, the fugitives made no answer, whereupon they were fired on, and one of them was instantly kdled. The other cried for quarter, and soon found himself among friends. The body of his dead comrade was secured and buried with funeral honors. So, during the siege, each side lost a few kdled by the accidents or mistakes of its own firin\u00b0- O' The night before the final bombardment, Capt. Garrity and a man of his battery made theh way up to where the federals,"], [263, "237 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. in McArthur's front, were digging an approach, and so close that some of the dirt Avas thrown upon them. Garrity listened to the talk of the men, and heard them say, \" We'd give the rebels to-morrow.\" One night, in the same division front, some confederates came out to redeve the sharpshooters, and the federals gave them a volley that quite disconcerted them, and drove the most of them back into the main works. In the excitement, one of their number, a son of Erin, ran up to one of the federal pits, and stooping down, anxiously inquired, \" Is this No. 3 ?\" \" Yes ; jump down quick !\" was the answer. Down he jumped, a prisoner. One night, the Eighth Wisconsin skirmishers captured a smad confederate post of three men, one of whom was an Irishman. He was asked d the confederates had any torpedoes in theh front, and replied, \" I trod light when I came out.\" Sometimes the firing between the federal and confederate sharpshooters would cease, and there would be some conver sation between them. It was, hoAvever, specially prohibited, on the part of the latter, by the garrison commander ; yet the men were instructed by every means practicable to exaggerate the numbers of the garrison. Conversation, when it occurred, was generally jocular and sarcastic in its character, and often partook of criticism of the artidery. When a federal addressed a confederate, he caded out, \"Hodoa, Johnny.\" The confederate ansAvered, \"Hodoa, Yank.\" One day, in front of McDermett, a federal soldier had caded out to the confederates several times, but got no answer. Finally, in good earnest, he asked why they so refused to answer. The confederate replied, \"Because you ad insult us so when we talk Avith you.\" Soldiers are proverbial for their wit and good humor, and the confederates were no exception to the rule. They used to say,"], [264, "238 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. \"Jeff. Davis wdl have to rent a piece of land to fight the war out on.\" They often declared, \"We are fighting for our rights in the territories under the Dred Scott decision.\" In Spanish fort the artiderists named theh heavy guns in honor of the ladies of theh officers, with the name in large capi tals placarded on the gun as \" The Lady Gibson,\" \" The Lady Slocum,\" \" The Lady Maury,\" &c, &c. The gunners spoke of them by these names instead of No. 1, 2, &c, and were always exceedingly polite and complimentary to them. They also named the federal guns, but caded them \" Anna Maria,\" \" Sarah Jane,\" \"Elizabeth Ann,\" &c, &c. And Avhen a federal gun fired, the sentinel would say, \" Look out, boys, Anna Maria is going to speak.\" It would pass down the line, and ad knew in advance the direction the shot would come, and get shelter. Then when one of theh guns was to be fired, they would say, \" Ah, my lads ! Look out now for the Lady Slocum ; when she speaks the Yanks must hush up and hide.\" The effect of some of the sheds was fearful. One day a fede ral mortar shed fed inside the garrison works, plunged through seven feet of earth and logs, and kdled four men and wounded three, ad of whom were asleep. One of the men was thrown up twenty feet into the air and came down dead, of course, for every bone in him was broken ; but he was not at ad torn."], [265, "CHAPTER XXVII. FURTHER OPERATIONS OF LUCAS' CAVALRY\u2014 COMBAT OF MOUNT PLEASANT. On the morning of Aprd 5, Gen. Lucas moved out from near Blakely with ad of his command, except the Thirty-first Massachusetts mounted infantry, taking ten days' half rations, and all the forage the men could carry, to occupy Claiborne, on the Alabama river. The same night he camped at Stockton, and the next morning continued his march. On the fore noon of the 7th, while halting to feed, a freedman came to him, on his way from Gen. Wilson, bearing despatches from that officer to Gen. Canby. He had come down the river, having passed through more than one confederate camp, but had eluded detection. The papers were carefully sewed up in the collar of his vest. Gen. Lucas furnished the faithful man a mule to ride, and sent him on to Gen. Canby, with a guard, under a sergeant. Combat of Mount Pleasant. \u2014 From the same bearer of des patches, Lucas learned that a force had recently come up from Mobde and occupied Claiborne ; and he resolved to capture it. With that view, he marched tid a late hour in the night. Start ing at daylight the next morning, Aprd 8th, some delay was soon after experienced in repahing a bridge so as to cross his artillery. At Mount Pleasant, Maj. Ives, with a battalion of the First Louisiana cavahy, had dispersed a detachment of mditia. The column halted an hour at that place to feed, and on resum ing the march, Maj. Ives kept a quarter of a mile in advance. In course of an hour, while marching along in the wood, where"], [266, "240 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. the ground was swampy, his battalion was met unexpectedly by a sharp volley of musketry, proceeding from a force drawn up in line of battle, but nearly concealed, on the farther side of a piece of low ground. The suddenness of the attack checked the advance, and, for a moment, threw it into confusion ; but order was soom restored, and Maj. Ives deployed his smad force, answered the fire, yet had to fad back, though slowly. Lucas being near at hand, ordered the remainder of the First Louisi ana, under Lieut.-Col. Badger, forward at the gallop, and the rest of the column to fodow at a trot. The Fhst Louisiana, having deployed, made a gallant charge on the attacking force. The latter consisted of the Fdteenth confederate cavalry. It was well posted; but the charge was so spirited and wed supported that they made but brief resistance, and then gave way. Lucas pursued with vigor for two mdes, capturing two battle-flags, three commissioned officers, and sixty men, with many horses and arms. The victory would have been more complete but for the miry nature of the ground. The loss in Lucas' command was confined to the Fhst Louisiana, and con sisted of two men killed, and one commissioned officer (Lieut. Boyle) and four men Avounded. The casualties of the Fdteenth confederate were reported to be greater. That regiment retired north, moving rapidly through Claiborne. Lucas reached that place at eleven, p. m., and went into camp. While there, his scouts captured several more prisoners, some of whom were officers or agents of importance, and by the 18th, the whole number in his possession was one hundred and fifty. On that clay, pursuant to orders from Gen. Canby, he marched for Blakely."], [267, "CHAPTER XXVIII. OPERATIONS OF WILSON'S CAVALRY IN ALABAMA. While Canby was moving upon Mobile, Thomas caused a diversion to be made in his favor by a column of cavalry under Brevet Maj.-Gen. J. H. Wilson. But the operations of that column included results beyond those of a co-operative character ; and they have hardly ever been surpassed, even by the achievements of Alexander. The condition and purposes of the confederates in Central Alabama show that the flank and rear of Canby's army would have been much harassed but for Wilson's movement. Lieut.-Gen. Taylor, commanding the department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana, in some respects, it is true, was in straitened circumstances. He could no longer procure materials nor transportation on credit, and was dependent on the funds derived from the produce loan, cotton being the main article. There were many deserters from his forces j1 and soon after the fad of Mobile and Selma, he would have accepted colored troops but for a lack of arms.2 Nevertheless, there was 1 Capt. Surget (A. A.

On the 23d of March, Taylor ordered troops to Greenvide to resist Steele, who was then thought to be moving on Montgomery. 2 His veteran battahons were directing their steps southeastwardly, when the rattdng of Wilson's sabres was heard from the north.3 Then they paused, and soon wheeled about. Taylor hoped he would be able to oveipower this unexpected column ; and he promised Maury that when he had accomplished that purpose he would go to his assistance.'1 had arms for them.

Organization of Wilson's Cavalry. \u2014 For several weeks pre vious to the campaign, the cavalry corps of the military division of the Mississippi, numbering twenty-two thousand, had been in camp on the north bank of the Tennessee, at Gravelly Springs and Waterloo. The surface of the country is there roding ; the sod rocky. The men had comfortable quarters, the horses good shelter, and suppdes were furnished in abundance. The fault, in the cavahy system had previously been overwork in detach ments, and the absence of instruction and undormity of equip ment. Gen. Wdson instituted a thorough system of instruction, and every necessary effort was made to bring the corps to the highest possible state of efficiency. The troops were drdled in the double-rank formation. Wilson discovers the true genius of a soldier when he says that the future victories of the corps were \" won by patient industry and instruction whde in the can tonments of Gravedy Springs and Waterloo.\" Early in February, Knipe's division, numbering five thousand, was sent round by water to Canby, leaving under Wilson's immechate command seventeen thousand men, requiring about five thousand horses for a complete remount. The lack of horses compeded him, reluctantly, to leave Hatch's division at East port, and the divisions assigned for the march, were the First> Second, and Fourth, commanded, respectively, by McCook, Long, and Upton ; comprising, in all, a dttle over twelve thousand mounted men. The dismounted men of the three divisions, numbering fifteen hundred, Avere designated as escort for the supply train ; were organized into battalions, and commanded by Maj. Archer. The division commanders were directed to see that every trooper was provided with five days' fight rations in haversacks, twenty-four pounds of grain, one hundred rounds of ammuni tion, and one pair of extra horseshoes for his horse ; that the pack-animals were loaded with five days' rations of hard-bread,"], [270, "244 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. ten of sugar, coffee, and salt ; and the wagons with forty-five days' rations of coffee, twenty of sugar, fifteen of salt, and eighty rounds of ammunition. This adowance was prescribed on the basis of a sixty days' campaign, and under the supposi tion that the command Avould be able to supply itsed from the country through which it marched, with everything else in abundance. Only enough hard-bread was taken to last through the sterde region of North Alabama. The supply and baggage train numbered about two hunched and fifty wagons, and was under the charge of Captain W. E. Brown, acting chief quartermaster. In addition, there was a light canvas pontoon train of thirty boats, transported by fifty six-mule wagons, and in charge of a battalion of the Twelfth Missouri cavahy, Maj. J. M. Hubbard commanding.1 Wdson's instructions from Lieut.-Gen. Grant, adowed him the amplest discretion, as an independent commander. The March. \u2014 As the rains had retarded Canby's columns, so the overflow of the Tennessee delayed Wilson ; and it turned out that there was a happy concurrence in theh movements. Wdson commenced crossing the Tennessee on the 18th of March ; and at daylight of the 22d, the order of march having been designated, the movement began from Chickasaw. The scanty condition of the country, and the purpose of creating doubt in the mind of the enemy as to the real object of the column, rendered it prudent that it should move on diverging routes. Upton's division, fodowed by his train, marched rapidly by the most easterly route, passing Barton's station, Busselvide, 1 Here, and in many of the following pages, I borrow largely from the report of Brevet Maj .-Gen. J. H. Wilson, dated Macon, Georgia, June 29, 1865."], [271, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 245 Mount Hope, and Jasper, to Sanders' ferry, on the west fork ot the Black Warrior river. Long's division marched by the way of Cherokee station and Frankfort ; but being encumbered by the pontoon train, and having mistaken the road by which it should have ascended the mountain, was considerably delayed in reaching Busselvide. Thence it marched south, by the Tuscaloosa road, tid it crossed Upper Bear creek ; then turned to the eastward, by the head of Buttahatchie creek, crossed Byler's road near Thorn hdl, and struck Blackwater creek about twenty-five mdes from Jasper. The crossing of the last-mentioned stream, and the road for six miles beyond, were as bad as could be, but, by industry, every thing was got through to Jasper, and the ford on the Warrior, with but httle loss of time. McCook's division pursued the same route to Bear creek on the Tuscaloosa road, but instead of turning to the eastward at that place, continued the march toward Tuscaloosa as far as Elchidge, and thence east to Jasper. Tn this order the whole command arrived at and crossed the Black Warrior river. The ford on the west branch was extremely difficult of approach as wed as of passage. The country on both sides, very rugged and six or seven hundred feet above the bed of the stream, was entirely destitute of forage ; the stream itself was at the time hkely to become entirely impassable by the rain which threatened to occur at any moment. Wdson, therefore, having heard at Jasper, on the 27th, that a part of Forrest's force under Chalmers, was marching by way of Bridgevide toward Tuscaloosa, and apprehending that the balance of For rest's force might be sent in the same direction, directed his division commanders to replenish the haversack, to see that the pack animals were fully laden, to leave all the wagons, except the artidery, and march with the greatest possible"], [272, "246 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. rapidity, via Elyton to Montevado. He felt confident the enemy would endeavor to check his movement with the hope of destroying the supply train. So he left it between the two streams, with instructions to have it pushed on as far as Elyton, where it would receive further orders. In crossing the two branches of the Warrior each division lost a few horses, but no men. Whde at Elyton, on the evening of the 30th, Wilson directed McCook to detach Croxton's brigade, with orders to move on Tuscaloosa as rapidly as possible, burn the public stores, mili tary codege, bridges, foundries, and factories there, return toward the main column by the way of Centervide road, and rejoin it at or in the vicinity of Selma. Besides covering the trains and inflicting a heavy blow on the enemy, Wdson hoped by that detachment to develop any movement intended to intercept his main column. The achievements and hazards of Croxton's brigade wdl be related hereafter. On the 28th, Forrest was moving from West Point via Finche's ferry ; and the same day he learned that Gen. Dan. Adams' scouts from Montevallo reported the federals moving on Tusca loosa with a force estimated at five thousand. On that day, also, he was informed that Gen. Adams reported that three divisions under Wilson camped at Jasper the night of the 26th, and that their destination was Elyton and Montevado. On the 28th, the Kentucky brigade was put in motion to strike the federal rear from Tuscaloosa. On the 29th, orders were again sent to Gen. W. L. Brandon to send twenty-five hunched Mississippi reserves from Scooba to West Point. Skirmishes near Montevallo. \u2014 Gen. Upton's division in the advance encountered a small mounted force at Elyton, but pushed it rapidly across the Cahawba to Montevallo. The enemy having feded trees into the ford and otherwise obstructed it, the railroad bridge near Hdlsborough was floored over bv"], [273, "247 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Gen. E. F. Winslow's brigade. Upton crossed his division and pushed on to Montevallo, where he arrived late in the eA^ening of the 30th. Winslow's brigade had a slight skirmish just before entering Montevallo, which was participated in by three companies of the Fourth Iowa, under Maj. W. W. Woods, and one man of the Fourth Iowa was sfightly wounded. Long and McCook marched by the same route. In that region Upton's division destroyed the Bed Mountain, Central, Bibb, and Co lumbiana iron-works, Cahawba rolhng mids, five collieries, and much valuable property; ad of which were in fud operation. Wilson arrived at Montevallo, on the afternoon of March 31, where he found Upton's division ready to resume the march. Directly after, the confederates made theh appearance on the Selma road, pushing in the federal pickets. By Gen. Wdson's direction, Upton moved his division out at once, Gen. A. J. Alexander's brigade being in advance. After a sharp fight and handsome charge, by the Fifth Iowa cavalry, Col. J. M. Young commanding, Alexander's brigade drove the confederate cavalry, a part of Crossland's Kentucky brigade, and Boddy's division, rapidly and in confusion toward Bandolph. On theh seeking to make a stand at Six-Mile creek, south of Montevado, Upton caused Bodney's battery (I, Fourth United States artillery) to take position and open fire, and pushed Winslow's brigade to the front. The Tenth Missouri cavahy, Lieut. Col. F. W. Ben teen commanding, dismounted and forced the confederates from their position, the Tenth suffering a loss of two men wounded. While that regiment was mounting, the Third Iowa cavahy, Col. J. W. Noble commanding, took the advance and charged the confederates with one company at a time on the road when their column was in retreat. A portion of the confederates being separated from theh main force, Capt. Johnson, of the Third, with two companies, was sent to the right and charging with vigor and gadantry, captured a number. On the main"], [274, "248 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. road, the confederates were driven to Randolph, leaving many animals and men along the road. Winslow's brigade took seventy-five prisoners. The Third Iowa behaved with its habitual gallantry. It was led by Col. Noble, whose adjutant lost his horse in the first charge. Meantime, the enemy being familiar with the ground attacked the rear and right of Wins low's brigade, when Lieut.-Col. Peters, commanding the Fourth Iowa, dismounted seven companies of that regiment, charged the enemy, driving him about two miles, kiding and wounding several and capturing two. The loss of the Fourth was three severely, and two slightly wounded. The gadantry of men and officers had been conspicuous throughout the day, and much increased the moral supremacy of the corps. Upton's division bivouacked that night fourteen mdes south of Montevado, and at dav/n the next day, Aprd 1, moved forward to Randolph. At that point, in pursuance of the order of march for the day, Gen. Upton turned to the east, for the purpose of going by the way of Old Maplesville, and thence by the Old Selma road, whde Gen. Long was instructed to push forward on the new road. Capture of Despatches. \u2014 At Randolph, Upton's scouts cap tured a confederate cornier just from CentreAude, from whose person were taken two despatches, one from Brig.-Gen. W. H. Jackson, commanding one of Forrest's divisions, and one from Major Anderson, Forrest's chief of staff. From the first Wd son learned that Forrest, with a part of his command, was in his front \u2014 which had also been learned from prisoners \u2014 that Jack son with his division, and ad the wagons and artidery of the confederate cavalry, marching from Tuscaloosa, via Trion toward Centrevide, had encamped the night before at Hid's plantation, three mdes beyond Scottsboro ; that Croxton, with the brigade detached at Elyton, had struck Jackson's rear guard at Trion and interposed himsed between it and the train ;"], [275, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 249 that Jackson had discovered this, and intended to attack Crox ton at daylight, Aprd 1. He learned from the other despatch that Chalmers had also arrived at Marion, Alabama, and had been ordered to cross to the east side of the Cahawba, near that place, for the purpose of joining Forrest in Wdson's front, or in the works at Selma. He also learned that a force of dismounted men were stationed at Centrevide, with orders to hold the bridge over the Cahawba as long as possible, and in no event to let it fad into the hands of the federals. Shortly after the interception of these despatches Wdson received a despatch from Croxton, written from Trion, the night before, stating he had struck Jackson's rear ; and instead of pushing on toward Tuscaloosa, as he was ordered, he would follow and endeavor to bring him to an engagement, hoping, thereby to prevent his junction with Forrest. Having this information, Wilson directed McCook to strength en the battahon previously ordered to Centreville, by a regiment and to fodow at once with La Grange's enthe brigade, leaving all pack-trains and wagons with the main column, so that he could march with the utmost celerity ; and after seizing the Centrevdle bridge, and leaving it under protection of a sufficient guard, to cross the Cahawba, and continue his march by the Scottsvide road toward Trion. His orders were to attack and break up Jackson's forces, form a junction with Croxton, if practicable, and rejoin the corps, with his enthe division, by the Centrevide-road to Selma. Although McCook did not leave Bandolph till near eleven, a. m., and the distance to ScottsAille was nearly forty miles, Wilson hoped, by the movement to do more than secure the Centreville bridge, and prevent Jackson from joining the force in front of the main column."], [276, "250 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. BATTLE OF EBENEZER CHURCH. Having anticipated Forrest, in his characteristic plan of get ting upon the rear of his adversary, Wilson directed Long and Upton to allow him no rest, but push him toward Selma Avith the utmost rapidity. Those officers comprehended the situa tion, and pressed forward, with zeal and activity, on the roads that have been indicated. The advance of both divisions encountered smad parties of confederates, but drove them back to theh main force at Ebenezer church, six mdes north of Plantersvide. Forrest had chosen a position on the north bank of Bogler's creek, and disposed of his force for battle, his right resting on Mulberry creek, and his left on a high wooded ridge, with four pieces of artdlery to sweep the Bandolph road, upon which Long's division was advancing, and two on the MaplesAide road. He had under his command, in line, Arra strong's brigade of Chalmers' division ; Boddy's division ; Cross land's Kentucky brigade ; and a battalion of three hunched infantry, just arrived from Selma ; in ad, about fiAre thousand men. Part of his front was covered by a slashing of pine trees and rad barricades. Gen. Long, on discovering the confederates in strength close upon the main body, reinforced his advance guard (a battahon of the Seventy-second Indiana mounted infantry) by the balance of the regiment, dismounted, and formed it on the left of the road. As it moved forward, the confederate advance fed back. At that juncture, he ordered fonvard four companies of the Seventeenth Indiana mounted infantry, Lieut.-Col. Frank White commanding. With draAvn sabres, that gadant battalion drove the enemy, in confusion, into the main line, dashed against that, broke through it, rode over the artidery, and, finady, turned to the left, and cut its way out, leaving one officer and sixteen men in the hands of the confederates, either kdled or wounded. In"], [277, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 251 this charge, Capt. Taylor, of the Seventeenth Indiana, lost his fife, after having led his men into the very midst of the enemy, and engaged in a running fight, of two hundred yards, with Forrest in person. While this was transpiring, Upton's division was coming from a northeasterly direction on the Maplesvide road. Alexander's brigade was in the advance, and hearing the filing and cheers of Long's men on the right, when within three mdes of Ebenezer church, pushed forward at the trot, and soon came to the scene of action. Alexander promptly deployed his brigade mostly on the right of the road, intending to connect with Long's left, and soon afterward advanced his line dismounted. In less than an hour, although the resistance was determined, the position was carried by a gadant charge, and the confederates routed. Gen. Alexander's brigade captured two guns and about two hundred prisoners, whde one gun fed into the hands of Gen. Long's division. Winslow's brigade came up just as the engagement was being decided ; and two regiments, the Third Iowa leading, were hastened to the front. Capt. Amim's Company I of the Third was thrown out on the left of the road, and directed to charge a line formed on the bank of the creek four hundred yards from the head of Winslow's column. That company, having to throw down a fence under severe fire, had one officer, Lieut. J. J. Veach, and several men wounded, losing also about fifteen horses. The column moving forward the last of Forrest's forces retired, and the Thhd IoAva cavalry pursued them five miles to Plantersville. Capt. John BroAvn's Company L charged over a deep stream, captured a color company, and, indeed, more men than his command numbered."], [278, "CHAPTER XXIX. CAVALRY OPERATIONS CONTINUED.\u2014 BATTLE OF SELMA. The night of Aprd 1, Wilson's corps bivouacked near Plant ersvdle, nineteen mdes from Selma. With almost constant fio-hting, it fiad driven its adversaries twenty-four mdes since morning. It gave them no pause nor rest. At daydght of the 2d, Long's division took the advance, closely followed by Upton's. Wdson, having paid heed to that important injunction of Napoleon \u2014 to be informed of the condition of the enemy \u2014 had obtained a wed-chawn sketch, and complete description of the defences of Selma. That city is situated on the north bank of the Alabama river, about one hunched feet above high water. It contained an arsenal and foundries, and Avas the most important confederate depot of the southwest. Its fortifications consisted of a bastioned line on a radius of nearly three miles, extending from the Alabama river below to the same above the city. That part of the line west of the city was covered with a mhy, deep, and almost impassable creek, with sloping banks ; that on the east side, by a swamp, extending from the river almost to the Summervdle road, and entirely impracticable for mounted men at all times. On the east side also is a stream with high and precipitous banks. The profile of the works was as fodows : Height of parapet, six to eight feet; thickness, eight feet; depth of ditch, five feet; width, from ten to fifteen feet ; height of stockade on the glacis, five feet; sunk in the earth, four feet. The place was indeed"], [279, "W ~\\\"Wr Profde of Nos. I II HI IV % fe a <\" Hi-aat"], [280, ""], [281, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 253 strongly and elaborately fortified, and the stockade in front of the ditch was no inconsiderable obstruction. Wdson directed Long to march by the flanks of brigades, approach the city, and cross to the SummerAide road, without exposing his men, and to develop his hne as soon as he should arrive in front of the works. Upton was directed to move on the Bange Line road, sending a squadron on the Burnsville road. Lieut. Bendelbrook, with a battalion of the Fourth United States cavalry, was instructed to move down the rad road, burning stations, bridges, and trestle-work, as far as Burnsvide. By rapid marching, without opposition, the troops were ad in sight of the town, and mostly in position, by four, P. M. Lieut.-Gen. Taylor left the city at about that hour, leaving Forrest in command, Avho had under him a garrison numbering nearly seven thousand, including the citizen militia. Preachers of the gospel took muskets and went into the trenches. ASSAULT. As Gen. Wilson approached the city he perceived that the information he had received was generady correct. He then made a reconnoissance of the works from left to right, for the purpose of satisfying himsed as to the true point of attack, and the probable chances of success. He directed Gen. Long to assault the works by moving diagonally across the road upon which his troops were posted, while Gen. Upton, at his own request, with a picked force of three hundred men, was directed to penetrate the swamps upon his left, break through the hne covered by it, and turn the garrison's right, the balance of his division to conform to the movement. The signal for the ad vance was to be the discharge of a single gun from Bodney's battery, to be given as soon as Upton's turning movement had developed itself."], [282, "254 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Before that plan could be executed, and whde waiting for the signal to advance, Gen. Long was informed that a strong force of confederate cavahy had begun skirmishing with his rear, and threatened a general attack upon his pack train and led horses. He had left a force of six companies well posted at the creek, in anticipation of that movement, afterward ascer tained to have been made by Chalmers, in obedience to the instructions of Forrest. This force was at Marion the day before, and was expected on the road from that place. Fearing, lest the affair might compromise the assault upon the main position, Long (having strengthened the rear by another regi ment), determined to make the assault at once, and without waiting for the signal, gave the order to advance. His com mand was formed in line of battle dismounted, the Seventeenth Indiana mounted infantry on the right, and next, from right to left, the One Hundred and Twenty-third Blinois and Ninety eighth Blinois mounted infantry, the Fourth Ohio cavalry, and Fourth Michigan cavalry, comprising in ad fifteen hundred officers and men. They had to charge across open ground six hundred yards to the works, exposed to the fire of artillery and musketry, and that part of the line they were to assault was manned by Armstrong's brigade, regarded as the best of For rest's corps, and numbering fifteen hundred strong. Long's division sprang forward in an unfaltering manner. Its flanks had some difficulty in crossing a ravine and marshy sod ; but in less than fifteen minutes it had swept over the works and driven the confederates in confusion toward the city. But the loss was considerable, and among the wounded was Gen. Long himsed, who was temporardy succeeded in command by Col. Minty. Wilson arrived on that part of the field just after the works were carried. He at once notified Upton of the success, directed Col. Minty to form Long's division for a new advance, ordered Col. Vad, commanding the Seventeenth"], [283, "255 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Indiana, to place his own regiment and the Fourth United States cavahy, Lieut. O'Connel, and the Board of Trade bat tery, Capt. Bobinson commanding, and renewed the attack. The garrison had occupied a new hne, but partially finished, on the edge of the city. A gadant charge by the Fourth United States cavahy was repulsed, but it rapidly re-formed on the left. It was now quite dark. Upton's division advancing at the same time, a new charge was made by the Fourth Ohio, Seventeenth Indiana, and Fourth cavalry, dismounted. The troops, inspired by the wildest enthusiasm, swept everything before them, and penetrated the city in ad directions. Upton's division, though encountering less resistance, charged with its habitual spirit and devotion. It was said that the men, finding it too difficult to break down or pry away the sharp-pointed stockade in front of the earthworks, those behind, coming on swiftly, jumped on the shoidders of the foremost and leaped the obstructions, thus storming the works by a game of \" leap frog.\"1 Nor was such a humorous expedient inconsistent Avith the coolness and fervid valor of those splenchd troops. During the first part of the action, the Chicago Board of Trade battery had occupied a commanding position, and steadily replied to the garrison guns. \u25a0 The loss in Long's division was forty lulled and two hundred and sixty wounded. Of the latter, besides Long, were Cols. Mdler, McCormick, and Briggs. Wdson's force, engaged and in supporting distance, was nine thousand men and eight guns. The garrison fought with considerable coolness and skill. Forrest was reported to have been engaged personally in two or three romantic combats ; and he, with Gens. Armstrong, Boddy, and Adams, and a number of men, escaped under cover of darkness, by the Burnsvdle or river road. A portion of 1 Iugersoll's Iowa and the Rebellion, p. 465."], [284, "256 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Upton's division pursued on the Burnsvdle road until long after midnight, capturing four guns and many prisoners. The immediate fruits of Wdson's victory were thirty-one field guns and one thirty-pounder Parrott ; two thousand seven hundred prisoners, including one hundred and fifty officers ; a number of colors, and large quantities of stores of every kind. As soon as the troops could be assembled and got into camp, Brevet Brig. -Gen. Winslow was assigned to the command of the city, with orders to destroy everything that could benefit the confederate cause. In the excitement of the hour, some acts of plunder were committed. Gen. Upton was directed to march at daylight with his diAision, for the purpose of driving Chalmers to the west side of the Catawba, to open communication with McCook, who was expected from Centrevide, and to assist him in bringing in the train. In anticipation of the fad of Selma the confederates burned twenty-five thousand bales of cotton, sent the steamers that were there, down the Alabama, to go up the Tombigbee, and cut loose a pontoon bridge which floated down to Oven bluff. Gen. Wdson directed Lieut. Haywood, Fourth Michigan cav ahy, engineer officer on his staff, to employ ad the resovuces of the shops in the city in the construction of pontoons, with the intention of laying a bridge and crossing to the south side of the Alabama river, as soon as he could satisfy himsed of Gen. Canby's success in the operations against Mobde. On Aprd 5, Upton and McCook arrived with the train, but nothing definite had been heard of Croxton. McCook had been entirely successful in his operations against Centreville, but on reaching Scottsboro, he found Jackson well posted Avith a force, he thought too strong to attack. After a sharp skirmish1 he 1 Capt. Surget (A. A, G.), to My.

Meantime, Col. Noble, Third Iowa, Avith a detachment of Winslow's brigade, made a march to the rear through Summerfield to Johnson's ferry, returning on the 6th. On the 3d, Gen. Wirt Adams, at West Point, Avas ordered to prepare immediately to move east via PickensA'dle Avith every available man of his own and Scott's Louisiana brigade, leaving the battery behind. On the 4th, Lieut.-Gen. Taylor was as Mobile. On the same day, Capt. Surget telegraphed from Meridian to Gen. Hodge at Jackson, that there were some eighty federal prisoners there, recent captures. On the 5th, Taylor returned from Mobile, and at one, P. M., telegraphed Forrest as fodows : \" Beturned from Mobde this morning. Wirt Adams left Columbus this morning with fifteen hundred men to join you at Marion via Pickensvdle 'Tis useless to fight enemy until we are strong enough to Avhip him. Hang on his flanks and rear, cut off smad parties and delay his movements tid you can get your whole force in hand.\" The same day Capt. Surget informed Forrest \u2014 \" At Mobile everything goes on wed. Yankees have gained nothing thus far.\" On the 6th of Aprd, Gen. Wdson haAing ordered Maj. Hub bard to lay a bridge over the Alabama with the utmost despatch, went to Cahawba to see Gen. Forrest, who had agreed to meet Wdson there, under a flag of truce, to arrange an exchange of prisoners. Wdson soon discovered that he need not expect liberality in the matter, and that Forrest hoped to recapture the prisoners in his hands. During the conversation, Wilson learned from Forrest that Croxton had had an engagement with Wirt Adams, near Bridgevdle, forty mdes southwest of Tusca loosa, two days before. This, it appears, assured Wdson ot 17"], [286, "258 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. Croxton's success and safety, and he determined to lose no time in crossing to the south side of the Alabama. Beturning to Selma he urged every one to the utmost exertions. The river was quite fud and rising, its current swift and strong. The weather was also unsettled and rainy, but by great energy and labor night and day the bridge, eight hundred and seventy feet long, was constructed, and the command all crossed by day light of the 10th. Three times the bridge was swept away. Gen. Alexander narrowly escaped drowning; boats were cap sized, and men precipitated into the stream, but the crossing was finady accompfished with success. Behind him, in the destroyed arsenal, foundries, arms, stores, and military munitions of every kind, Wilson had left immense ruin. He had struck the Confederacy a disastrous blow. At Selma, he left the severely wounded of his command, and many paroled prisoners. But the confederates considered the parole illegal, and ordered the men to duty. Wdson now determined to march, by the way of Montgomery, into Georgia, and, after breaking up railroads, and destroy ing stores and army supplies in that state, to march thence, as rapidly as possible, to the theatre of operations in North Carolina and Virginia. He was now able to secure greater mobdity to his command. Enough horses had been captured to mount all the dismounted men. The surplus wagons, and ad of the bridge train, except enough for twelve bags, were destroyed. The column was cleared of the multitude of freedmen who hovered around it, except such ablebodied ones as could enlist, who were organ ized into regiments, one to each division. Efficient officers were assigned these commands; and how well they succeeded, is shown by the fact, that \" in addition to subsisting themselves upon the country, they marched (upon one occasion) forty-five mdes, and frequently as much as thirty-five, in one day.\""], [287, "259 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. In the march from Selma, La Grange's brigade, of McCook's division, was given the advance. The recent rains had rendered the roads quite muddy, and a smad body of confederate cavalry, in falling back before La Grange, destroyed several bridges, so that the progress of the column was slow. On the morning of the 12th, the advance-guard reached Montgomery, the capital of Alabama, and received the sur render of the city from the mayor and council. The confed erate general, Adams, with a smad force, after fading back from before Wdson's column, to the city, burned ninety thousand bales of cotton, stored there, and continued his retreat to Mount Meigs, on the Columbus road. Gen. McCook assigned Col. Cooper, Fourth Kentucky cav alry, to the command of the city, and immediately began the destruction of the public stores. Maj. Weston of the Fourth Kentucky, with a smad detachment of his regiment, made a rapid march toward Wetumpka, swam the Coosa and Tada poosa rivers, and captured five steamboats and their cargoes, which were taken to Montgomery and destroyed. The grand column entered Montgomery in imposing style. The capitol stands on a commanding site, and is visible far out in the country. As they approached the city the troopers were dehghted to see the federal flag restored to its position, and proudly floating from the dome of the first capitol of the then tottering confederacy. Pausing two days at Montgomery, Wdson resumed his march on the morning of the 14th, moving into Georgia and accom plishing brilliant results ; the most important of which was the capture, on the 16th of April, of the fortified posts of Columbus and West Point. On the 20th, he entered Macon, where he was met by news of the armistice."], [288, "CHAPTER XXX. OPERATIONS OF CROXTON'S BRIGADE. Gen. John T. Croxton's brigade consisted of the Second Michigan cavalry, Col. Johnston, the Fourth Kentucky mounted infantry, Col. Kedy, the Sixth Kentucky cavahy, Maj. Fidler, and the Eighth Iowa cavahy, Col. Dorr, fifteen fiunched effective. Leaving the Fourth Kentucky cavahy temporarily with the train, Croxton, on the morning of March 31, marched from Elyton for Tuscaloosa, having eleven hundred effective men. He took no artillery nor train, save one headquarters bag gage-wagon, three ambulances, and the adowance of pack mules. The men had each about one hundred and tAventy rounds of ammunition, and, like the main column, were armed with Spencer carbines. At five, p. m., when approaching Trion, some twenty mdes from Tuscaloosa, and while ascending a rise of ground, in a wooded and broken country, the advance detected indications of the enemy, which proved to be the rear of Gen. W. H. Jack son's division, estimated at twenty-six hunched, and having artillery. Croxton's brigade deployed in hne near the top of the hid, with videttes on the crest, and having remained in that position tdl dark, went into camp off the road. Meantime, thorough scouting on the flanks, showed hostile forces on Croxton's left and left rear. Skirmish at Trion. \u2014 At daylight the next morning, Aprd 1, Croxton, in order to elude Jackson, though stdl having Tusca loosa in view, turned, by an unfrequented road, in a northeast erly direction, to the Dirt creek road, and marched rapidly for"], [289, "261 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. ten or fifteen miles. Jackson, however, made a sharp attack before the brigade was ad out of camp, the Sixth Kentucky cavahy losing some thirty men, including a lieutenant, captured. A. scouting party, of the Eighth Iowa, was cut off, ad of whom, except one, killed, made their way to Gen. Wdson. Gen. Jackson addressed a despatch to the commanding officer at Tuscaloosa, informing him that he had attacked and dis persed Croxton's force ; adding : \" It is scattered in the moun tains, and cannot again be codected. Assure the fair ladies of Tuscaloosa, that the tread of the Vandal hordes shall not podute the streets of theh beautdul city.\" Croxton marched that day about forty mdes, striking the Black Warrior river at Johnson's ferry. The Fourth Kentucky joined him at noon. The same night he crossed the Black Warrior. The stream was high and rapid ; and the men resorted to various plans to get across. The forty mdes' march \u2014 and some had been on duty the previous night; \u2014 had made them tired and stiff, but they addressed themselves to the duty of crossing the swollen river with cheerful alacrity. A smad flat-boat was used, but it would have required much time for the whole brigade to cross in that. Some attempting, whde mounted, to swim their horses, were carried under by the current. Others, to be odd, stripped to their shirts, and were pdoted across, holding to theh horses' tails ; a scene which occasioned no little merriment. A few horses were lost in crossmg. The brigade marched thirty-two miles the next day, and at ten, p. M., arrived before Tuscaloosa, but on the opposite side of the river. The bridge was refloored, and Col. Johnston, of the Second Michigan cavalry, with one -hundred and fifty officers and men of his regiment, crossed the bridge, surprised the guards, and captured the pieces of artidery. The Eighth Iowa entered about the same time, and Col. Dorr received"], [290, "262 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. formal surrender of the town at one, a. m. Upward of fifty prisoners were captured and paroled. After daylight, Croxton caused the mditary codege, the pubhc works and stores, to be destroyed. He remained there tid the 5th, trying to com municate with Wdson or McCook. The confederate scouts were hanging around Tuscaloosa, and, knowing that Jackson and Chalmers were between him and Selma, he thought it too hazardous to undertake to reach that place by way of Centre vdle. He therefore decided to move toward Eutaw, in the hope of crossing the Warrior lower down, and cutting the railroad between Selma and Demopohs. On the 5th, he re crossed the Black Warrior, burned the bridge, marched out on the Columbus (Mississippi) road, and, on the 6th, turned toward Eutaw. The same morning, at seven o'clock, Gen. Wht Adams, with fifteen hundred men, left Pickensvide, intending to join Forrest at Marion, by the way of Finche's ferry. Croxton, at the time, thought his force was larger. Combat of Pleasant Ridge.\u2014 About two, p. m., Adams' men began to annoy the rear of Croxton's brigade, consisting of the Sixth Kentucky cavahy, near Pleasant Bidge. Meantime, Croxton had re-crossed the Sipsa river, and turned on the mditary road toward Tuscaloosa. in front of the Sixth Ken tucky were the two ambulances and the wagon, and next in front of them was the Second Michigan. At about five, P. M., Adams charged the rear with much vigor, the shock falling entirely on the Sixth Kentucky cavahy. The commanding officer, Maj. Fidler, sent forward to Col. Johnston that he was hard pushed, and needed help, but before the message could be dehvered, he himsed and nearly a third of his regiment were captured or disabled. One of the ambulances was captured at the same time, in which was Croxton's valise.

In theh rear was a house, and farther back a hid and woods. In theh front was a field extending one hundred yards, and beyond that a body of timber. HeaAy rain was fading, accompanied with thunder and lightning ; yet it was a cold rain, and everything around was dreary. The ground was muddy, night was coming on, and it was believed a superior force would soon be hurled against them. Soon the Sixth Kentucky cavalry came hurrying up in some disorder, and the Second Michigan made an opening for them to pass through. Ad the column except the Second Michigan marched on. Adams' forces, encouraged with theh success, charged, mounted, against the Second Michigan, fully expecting to rout them. But the latter, reserving their firt till they were within short range, repulsed them. Then the confederates rethed out of sight, dismounted, and charged again. But again the Second Michigan men held their position hke statues, and drove them back with heavier loss. Adams' men charged repeatedly in a heroic manner, and as often were repulsed. Theh radying cries, and the exhortations by theh officers, coidd be plainly heard. One was heard to say, \" The d d Yankee cowards won't fight\u2014 they'd run !\" This only increased the sullen feelings of the Second Michigan men. Theh line never wavered. Theh own safety, probably the safety of the brigade, was secured by their firm courage and theh unerring aim. Finally, at dark, Adams ceased his attack. His loss must have been severe.1 The Second Michigan cavalry i \" Ws have reliable information that Gen.

John ston had his horse killed under him. The regiment then marched on, and at twelve o'clock overtook the rest of the brigade in camp. On the 7th, Croxton went into camp near Northport, a few mdes from Tuscaloosa. His foraging parties and scouts on the road to Columbus misled Wirt Adams' men, who, on that evening, reported him moving toward Columbus. Adams then turned his column in that direction, and arrived there at one, p. M., on the 8th, having marched forty-five miles in eleven hours.1 This put him about seventy miles northAvest from Croxton. Chalmers was moving toward Columbus the same time, and reached there the 9th. On the 11th, Croxton was stdl in camp near Northport on the Boder road, and picketing three miles out toward Columbus.2 The same day he sent four hundred freedmen toward Decatur. On the morning of the 12th, he marched northward ; and pass iug on through Jasper, recrossed the west fork of the Black Warrior river at Hadley's mid, marched nearly due east by the way of Mount Penson and Trussville, crossed the Coosa at True's and Collins' ferries, and continued on to Tadadega, a region opulent in mineral resources.

On the 22d of Aprd, the Eighth Iowa, being in advance, charged into Tadadega, with drawn sabres, against Gen. B. H. Hill's brigade, and put that force to route, losing two men, captured, and having one Avounded by a sabre-cut. The two captured men were taken by a squad of thirteen confederates ; but Lieut. Bennett, of the Eighth, with only two men, charged and scattered them, and rescued the two prisoners. At Tadadega, Croxton replenished the haversacks, and, on the 23d, pushed on, northeasterly, destroying the raihoad, and skirmishing with Hid, who had artidery, and was fading back on Jacksonvide. The Second Michigan cavahy was in the advance, but could not bring Hill's forces to an engagement, except Avith the advance guard. That regiment had one man kided, of Company B, near Oxford, and a detail having gone back to bury him, found too many confederates gathering to render theh stay safe. The Eighth Iowa, in the rear had two men kided. In the region of the Blue mountains, Croxton's command destroyed valuable iron and nitre works, besides radroad bridges, depots, and rolling stock. On the 24th, the Eighth Iowa cavalry was detached and sent to Jacksonville, and, on the way, had hvely skirmishes. Before reaching that place, a freedman informed the commander of the Eighth, that Hill's forces were in line in Jacksonvide, waiting for him. Then the Eighth at once broke into a gadop, and dashed on Avith enthusiasm. A lieutenant exclaimed, \" I do hope they have a battery.\" And a captain said, \" I Avish every man of Hid's command had a cannon, for we would have them all before night.\" But the remnant of Hid's forces \u2014 about one hundred \u2014 made a rapid retreat from the town. The Eighth Iowa rejoined the brigade the same night, having marched forty mdes."], [294, "266 CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. On the 25th, Croxton moved out on the road leading to New nan, Georgia. The next day, while crossing the Chattahoochee river, a white flag appeared on the opposite bank. Then those soldiers heard, but with unlike emotions, of the fad of Bichmond, the surrender of Lee, and the assassination of Lincoln. OBSERVATIONS ON WILSON'S RAID. 1. if Wilson had moved on Selma with five or six thousand men, as first proposed, he would have found himsed in the presence of Forrest with an inferior force. He undoubtedly would have diverted that able commander for a whde, from any movement toward Mobde, but in doing so must have suffered considerably ; and, in ad probability, would have furnished another of those examples which had already become too fre quent, of the poor success which attends aggressive operations with an inferior force. It was Wilson's own sagacity, as we have seen, that led to his taking a column sufficiently powerful for the task before it. Yet Colonel Doit and other officers in his command, who had spent some time as prisoners-of-war in the South, had even two years before urged the advantage of moving large columns into the very heart of the confederacy; forces which would be able to cause just such widespread and irreparable injury as was inflicted by Wilson's victorious corps. Had such columns been moved into the South a year or two earlier, they would have found but shght fortifications surround ing the important towns. 2. The capture of Selma must be regarded as the most remarkable achievement in the history of modern cavahy. The valor of the troops engaged in that splendid assaidt, idustrates the maxim of Alexander, that \" No place is impregnable to the brave nor secure to the timorous.\" 3. Croxton, when he rejoined Wdson, had marched six hun-"], [295, "CAMPAIGN OF MOBILE. 267 dred and fifty mdes in thirty days. His command encountered many hardships, and nothing but its pluck and good soldiership brought it out so successfully. It would seem that Croxton's better course would have been to have marched northeasterly from Tuscaloosa the morning after entering that place, instead of again recrossing the Black Warrior. The critical moment was, when he was attacked by Wirt Adams, near Pleasant Bidge. The firmness of Col. Johnston and the Second Michigan there was highly exemplary. Adams made a forced march to Colum bus, and got seventy mdes from him. But for the stern treat ment he had received from the Second Michigan, he doubtless Avould have fodowed the column when close upon its heels. Croxton's command felt an apprehension lest they would get out of ammunition, but their supply lasted to the end.
