The Punjab Government expressed a desire that an ac count of the arch\u00e6ologic remain around Delhi should be drawn up. It suggested that a good deal of scattered material was already available in the journal of the Asiatic-Society and the Delhi Arch\u00e6ological Society. A little work entitled \" Sights of Delhi\" was published about ten years ago. The information it contained was so meagre extending only to five pages that it served only excited a desire to learn more. The late Mr. Berresford undertook to and did prepare a Hand Book to Delhi into which he condensed whatever appeared to him interesting about Delhi from the following works : \u2014 Tod's Annals of Rajis than; Briggs' Ferishta ; Elphinstone's India ; Bernier's Travels ; Asiatic Researches ; Journal ofthe Asiatic Society ; Thorn's Memoir of the war in India ; Journal of the Delhi Arch\u00e6ological Society, and Sleeman's Rambles and Recollec tions. The compilation of Mr. Berresford, as far as it goes is very interesting though far from approaching to any thing exhaus tive, and the publication of an edition of this wTork with new illustrative matter will serve as much to commemorate the memory of the author who with his entire family were murdered at Delhi in 1857, as to induce others to make the present compilation in its turn an outline into which hereafter further researches and disquisitions as well as com* pletely fresh material may be introduced.

The ruins of ancient Delhi extend over a circumference of about twenty miles, and comprise the sites of many dis tinct cities founded by different Emjierors, amongst others those of Siree, Jahaupunah, Indraput or Deenpunah, Togh lukabad, Ferozabad, Shah poor and Delhi. The origin of ancient Delhi is involved in obscurity. The following extracts from Tod's Rajasthan give us nearly all that is known regarding it : \u2014 \u25a0 \" Vyasu, the author of the grand epic the Mahabharat, was son of Santana (of the race of Heri) sovereign of Delhi by Yojnaganda, a fisherman's daughter, consecpiently illegi timate. He became the spiritual father or preceptor of his nieces the daughters of Vichihavira, the son and successor of Santana. Vichihavira had no male offspring. Of his three daughters, one was named Pandea, and Vyasu being the sole remaining male branch of the house of Santana, took his niece and spiritual daughter Pandea to wife, and became the father of Pandu, afterwards sovereign of Indraprestha. Arrian gives the story thus : \" He (Hercules) had a daugh ter when he was advanced in years, and being unable to find a husband worthy of her, he married her himself, that be might supply the throne of India with monarchs. Her name was Pandea, and he caused the whole province in which she was born to receive its name from her.\" This is the very legend contained in the Poorans of Vyasu (who was Hiri-cul-es or chief of the race of Heri) and his spiritual daughter Pandea, from whom tho grand race, the Pamlii.-i, and from whom Delhi aud its dependencies were desiguated"], [32, "2 Tr.ATUTIONAL. the Pandua sovereignty. Her issue ruled for thirty-one nerations in direct descents, or from 120 to 610 before Christ, when the military minister, connected by blood, was chosen by the chiefs who rebelled against ijie last Pandua King, re presented as \" neglectful of all tbe cares of government,\" and whose deposition and death introduced a new dynasty. Two other dynasties succeeded in like manner by. the usui pa'tion of these military ministers, until Vicramaditya, when the Pandua sovereignty and era of Yoodishtra were overthrown. Indrdprestha remained without a sovereign, supreme power being removed from the north to the sou thern parts of India, till the fourth, or, according to some au thorities, the eighth century after Vicrama, when the throne of Yoodishtra was once more oecupi'e ) ' : T u.a'r tribe of Rajpoots, claiming descent! from the Pandus. To this an cient capital, thus resounded, the hew appellation of Delhi was given, and the dynasty of the {emnder* Avvnrfpal, last ed to the twelfth century, when he aUlkatr u in favor n\\ Pirthwiraja, the last imperial Rajpoot sovereign of India, whose defeat and death introduced the Mahomedans.\" Ferishta, in the introductory chapter to his History of the Mahomedan Power in India, states that Dehli was built by Dehloo, who reigned in Hindoostan prior to the invasion of Alexander the Great. The first time Delhi is mentioned in his history is A. D. 1008, when the Sultan Mahmood Ghizhevy resolved to chastise Anundpal, Raja of Lahore, for having assisted tbe ruler of Mooltan, who had revolted'. * It is said bymany flint Anundpal elm not abdicate in favour of losrelaOon Pirtbee- rai but was ousted by him. It would appear that Anundpal bad to perl'orm a religious 1/ilgrimage to som\u00ab place of worship near k-r.-irc ai d on Ids departVic \\> tli a \\ rry few mimber ot his retinue made over bis throne, fort, treasure and arms Sea. to Pirtheeraj en- inining him to allow no one to enter his Fort till he returned in person \u2014 IMrinsr *Annudpal's absence Pirtheeraj gained over the affections ol the soldiery and usurped the sovereignty \u2014When Anundpal returned he refused him admittance into In* Fort but not deeming it.safe to openly avow that he had thus so treacherously acted, lie gave out that the man who called himself Anundpal was hot the\" real King but one of his followers who had on his master's death, personated him \u2014This current report may or may not be true, but the fact et Auundpal's prneeeding to a place 6 miles off and building a Fovt and city named Anundpoor with a view to regain his lost power would shew that he had no intention of giving up his kingdom. Anundpal died ere he completed his Kent\u2014 the fouiuPl , us of which may still be seen and which are of brick and not \u2014 some say of pi i \u25a0 raj himself howeyfer did not lone: enjoy his ceded or acquired crown, for Shaliab (.non assumed the sovereignty alter a sanguinary engagement soon after and, lie was put to .kuta with torture by his followers and SUahaboodeen's death at ..j Umbulia \u2014 lint."], [33, "lilSTOUIO. 3 \"An'-. :s his intentions, Kent ambassadors on invitin her prin of Hindustan, who .

Gualior, Kalunjur, Kunouj, Dehly aud lA'j- mere entered into a confederacy.\" Briggs's Ferishta, vol 1 f) OO \u25a0 J I Three years after Mahmood plundered Tahnesur, a city 85 miles north of Delhi, and which was at that time, one of the chief places of Hindoo worship. We then find, that \" Mahmood, after the capture of Tahnesur, was desirous of proceeding to Delhi. But his nobles told him, that it would be impossible to keep possession of it, till he had rend-. ife'cl Mooltan a province of his government, and secured hims.-df from all apprehension of An nu ad pal, Raja' of Lahore.\" Briggs's Ferishta, vol. 1, p. 52. Iii the year 1017 Mahmood took Canouj, Meerut, Mahavuu, Muttra, s.eveii strong FoiiS on the banks of the river Jumna, the Fort of Raja Chund^laT, the Fort of Munj, and then proceeded against another Raja Chunder Ray, who fled to the mountains, but Ferishta makes no mention of his having taken Delhi, probably < ut account of its strength, as Ibn Batuta, who visited it al out 3t)0 years after, thus describes it : \" We then proceed-! I from Masudabad till we came to Delhi, the capital of the empire. It is a rnosjt magnificent city, combining at once both beauty and strength. Its walls are such as to have no equal in the world. This is the greatest city in Hindustan, and indeed of all Islamism in the East. It now consists of four cities, which becoming contiguous have formed one. This city was conquered in the year of the Hejira obi (A. D. ll;bS)\u201e The thickness of its walls is eleven cubits.\" Mahomed Ghoory, in his first and secerns] invasions of India, was defeated by the Hindoos, but in the third attempt he was successful, Chawand Ray, King of Delhi, being slain on the field of battle. \" After the return of Mahomed Ghoory (to Ghuzne) his General, Mullik Kootb-ood-Deen Eibuk, took the Fort of Merut and the city of Dehly from the family of Chawand"], [34, "4 Beuniei-'s Description in Aureng-Zebe's time. Ray, and it is owing to this circumstance that foreign nations say, '* The empire of Dehly was founded by a slave.\" In the year 589 (A. D. 1193), he also took the fort of Kole, aud making Dehly the seat of his government, established himself there, and compelled all the districts around to acknowledge the faith of Islam.\" Briggs's Ferishta, vol. 1, p. 178. \"In the year 5S8 (A. D. 1192), when Mahomed Ghoory took revenge of his enemies the Hindoos, he appoint ed Eibuk, now dignified with the title of Kootb-ood-Deen, to the chief command of the army, left to protect his con quests. In discharge of this duty, he took possession of many districts around, and reduced the Fort of Merut ; he also laid siege to Dehly, but the enemy finding their own numbers far exceeded the besiegers, marched out of the place and gave battle. The conflict was sanguinary on both sides, the River Jumna was discolored with blood. The Rajpoots were at length defeated, and retired within their walls, and the garrison, after a long siege, was at last reduced to surrender.\" Ibid vol. 1, p. 191. \" The entrance of the fortress presents nothing remarkable be sides two large elephants of stone, placed at either side of one of the principal gates. On one of the elephants is seated the statue of Jemel, the renowned rajah of Chitore; on the other is the statue of Polta his brother. These are the brave heroes who, with their still braver mother, immortalized their names by the extraordinary resistance which they opposed to the celebrated Acbar ; who defended the towns besieged by that great emperor with unshaken resolution ; and who, at length reduced to extre mity, devoted themselves to their country, and chose rather to perish with their mother in sallies against the enemy, than sub mit to an insolent invader. It is owing to this extraordinary devotion on their part, that their enemies have thought thom de serving of the statues here erected to their memory. These two large elephants, mounted by the two heroes, have an air of gran deur, aud inspire mo with au awe and respect which I cannot describe. * Dui ring the recent demolitions the greater part of Elephants have been exhumed."], [35, "Bernier's Description in Aukeng-Zebe's time. 5 After passing into tho citadel through this gate, there is seen a long and spacious street, divided in the midst by a canal of running water. The street has a long divan, or raised way, on both sides, in the manner of the Pont-ncuf, five or six French sect high and four broad. Bordering the divan, are closed arcades, which run up the whole way in the form of gates. It is upon this long divan that all the controllers, and other petty officers, exercise their functions without being incommoded by the horses and people that pass in the street below. The manseb dars or inferior omrahs mount guard on this raised way during the night. The water of the canal runs into the seraglio, divides and intersects every part, and then falls into the ditches ofthe fortification. This water is brought from the river Jumna, by means of a canal opened at a distance of five or six leagues above Delhi, and cut witb great labour, through fields aud rocky ground. The other principal gate of the fortress also conducts to a long aud tolerably wide street, which has a divan on both sides bor dered by shops instead of arcades. Properly speaking, this street is a bazaar, rendered very convenient iu the summer and the rainy season by the long and capacious arched roof with which it is covered. Air and light are iutromitted by several large and round apertures in the roof. Besides these two streets, the citadel contains many smaller ones, both to the right aud to the left, leading to the quarters where the omrahs mount guard, during four and twenty hours, in regular rotation, once a week. The places where this duty is performed may be called splendid, the omrahs making it a point to adorn them at their own expence. In general they are spaci ous divans or alcoves facing a flower garden, embellished by small canals of running water, reservoirs and jets d'eau. The omrahs on guard have their table supplied by the king. Every meal is sent ready dressed, and is received by the omrahs with all suitable ceremony, three times performing the taslim, or sa lute of grateful acknowledgement, by turning the face toward the king's residence, and then raising the hand to the head and lowering it to the ground."], [36, "6 Descriptive. There are besides many divans aud tents in different parts of the fortress, which serve as offices for piibiifi business. Large halls are seen in many places, called kar-kanys or work shops for the artisans. In one hall embroiderer? are busily em ployed, superintended by a master. In another you see the gold smiths ,* in a third, painters ; in a fourth, varnishers in lacquer ; in a fifth, joiners, turners, tailors and shoemakers; in a sixth, manufacturers of silk, brocade and those fine muslins of which are made turbans, girdles with golden flowers, and drawers worn b\\* females, so delicately fine as frequently to wear out iu one night.

I must not forget the am-ka::, to which you at length arrive after passing the palaces just mentioned. This is really a noble edifice : it consists of a large square court of arcades, not unlike our Place Royale, with this difference, however, that the arcade's of the am-kas have no buildings over them. Eacfi arcade is separated by a wall, yet in such a manner that there is a small door to pass from one to the other. Over the grand gate, situa ted iu the middle of one side of this court, is a capacious divan, quite open on the side of the court, called nagar-kanay.

To the ears of an European re cently arrived, this music sounds very strangely, for there are ten or twelve hautboys, and as many tymbals, which- play together. One of the hautboys, called karna, is a fathom and a half in length, and. its lower aperture cannot lie less than a French foot. The tymbals of brass or iron are some of them at least a fathom in diameter. You may. judge, therefore, of the roaring sound which issues from the nagar-kanay. On my first arrival it stunned me so as to be insupportabl.p : but such is the power of habit that this same noise is now heard by me with pleasure ; in the night, particularly, when in bed and afar, on my terrace this music sounds in my ears as solemn, grand and melodious. This is not altogether to lie wondered at, since it is played by persons instructed from infancy m the rules of melody, and possessing the skill of modulating aud turning the harsh sounds of the hautboy and tymbal so as to produce a symphony far from dis agieeable when beard at a certain distance. The nagar-kanayiis placed in an elovated situation, and remote from the royal apart ments, that the king may not be annoyed by the proximity of this music. Opposite to the grand gate, which supports the nagar-kana}', as you ci- mit, is a large and magnificent hall, decorated with several rows of pillars, whioh, as well as the ceiling, are all painted arid overlaid with gold. The hall is raised considerably from the ground and very airy, being open on the three sides that look into the court. In the centre of the wall that sepa rates the hall from the seraglio, aud higher from the floor than a man can reach, is a wide and lofty opening, or huge win dow, where the monarch every day, about noon, sits upon his throne, with some of his sons at his right and left ; while eunuchs standing about the royal person, flap away the flies with peacocks' tails, agitate the air with large fans, or wait with undivided attention and profound humility to perform the differ ent services allotted to each. Immediately under the throne is a divan, surrounded by silver rails, on which are assembled the whole body of omrah . the rajahs, and the ambassadors, all"], [38, "8 Ancient pastimes op the Moguls. .Standing, their eyes bent downward, and their hands crossed. At a greater distance from the throne are the manscbdars or inferi or omrahs also standing in the same posture of profound rever ence. The remainder of the spacious room, and indeed the whole court yard are filled with persons of all ranks, high aud low, rich and poor ; because it is in this extensive hall that tho king gives audience indiscriminately to all his subjects : hence it is called am-kas, or audience chamber of high aud low. During the hour and a half, or two hours that this ceremony continues, a certain number of the royal horses pass before tho throne, that the king may see whether they are well used aud in a proper condition. The elephants come next, their filthy hides having been well washed and painted as black as ink, with two large red steaks from the top of the head down to the trunk, where they meet. The elephants are covered with embroidered cloth ; a couple of silver bells are suspended to the two ends of a massy silver chain placed over their back ; and white cow-tails from Great Thibet, of great value, hang from the ears like im mence whiskers. Two small elephants, superbly caparisoned, walk close to these colossal creatures, like slaves appointed to their service. As if proud of his gorgeous attire and of the mag nificence that surrounds him, every elephant moves with a solemn and dignified step ; and when in front of the throne, the driver who is seated on his shoulder, pricks him with a pointed iron, animates and speaks to him, until the animal bends one knee, lifts his trunk on high and roars aloud, which the people consider as the elephant's mode of performing the taslim or usu al reverence. Other animals are next introduced ; \u2014 tamo antelopes, kept for the purpose of fightiug with each other ; nilgaus, or grey oxen, that appear to me to be a species of elk ; rhinoceroses ; largo Bengal buffaloes with prodigious horns which enable them to con tend against lions or tigers ; tame leopards, or panthers, employ ed in hunting antelopes ; some ofthe fine sporting dogs from Usbec of every kind, and each dog with a small red covering ; lastly every species of the birds of prey used in field sports for catching partridges, cranes, hares and even, it is said for hunting ante-"], [39, "The Mogul emperor in TnE Hall of Justice. 9 lopes, on whom they pounce with violence, beating their heads and blinding them with their wings and claws. Besides this procession of animals, the cavalry of one or two omrahs frequently* pass in review before the king ; the horsemen being better dressed than usual, the horses furnished with iron armour, and decorated with an endless variety of fantastic trap pings. The king takes pleasure also in having the blades of cutlasses tried on dead sheep, brought before him without the entrails, and neatly bound up. Young omrahs, mansebdars and gourzeberdars or mace-bearers exercise their skill, and put forth a'l their strength, to cut throueh the four feet, which are fastened toge ther, and thti body ofthe sheep at ono blow. But all these things are so many interludes to more serious matters. The king not only reviews his cavalry with peculiar attention, bnt there is not, since the war has been ended, a single cavalier, or other soldier, whom he has not inspected, and made himself personally acquainted with, increasing or reducing tho pay of some, and^lisniissing others from the service. All the peti tions held up in the crowd assembled in tho am-kas, are brought to the king and read in his hearing ; and the persons concerned being ordered to approach are examined by the monarch himself, who often redresses at the instant the wrongs of the aggrieved party. On another day of the week he devotes two hours to hear in private the petitions of ten persons, selected from the lower orders, aud presented to the king by a good and rich old man. Nor does he fail to attend the justice chamber, called adalet-ka nay, on another day of the week, attended by the two principal cadis, or chief justices. It is evident, therefore, that barbarous as we are apt to consider the sovereigns of Asia, they are not always unmindful of the justice that is due to their subjects. What I have stated ofthe proceedings in the assembly of the am-kas appears sufficiently rational and even noble ; but I must not conceal from you the base and disgusting adulation which is invariably witnessed there. Whenever a word escapes the lips of the king, if at all to the purpose, how trifling soever may be its import, it is immediately caught by the surrounding throng ; and the chief omrahs, extending their arms towards heaven, as if to"], [40, "10 Court adulation. receive some benediction, exclaim karamat ! karamat ! wonder ful ! wonderful ! he has spoken wonders ! Indeed there is no mogul who does not know and does not glory iu repeating this proverb in Persian verse : Aguer chah ronzra gouyed cheb est in Bubayed gouft inck niah ou peruin. If at noon day the king assorts that it is midnight, you are to say, behold the moon and tbe stars I The vice of flattery pervades all ranks. When a mogul for in stance has occasion for my services, he comes to tell me by way of preamble, and as matter of^course, that I am the Aristotalis the Bocrate, and the Abouysiua ulzaman ; the Aristotle, tlie Hippocrates, and the Avicenna of the age. At first I endeavour ed to prevent this fulsome mode of address by assuring my visi tors that I was very far from possessing the merit they seemed to imagine, and that no comparison ought to be made between 6uch great men aud me ; but finding that my modesty only in creased their praise, I determined to accustom my ears to their flattery as I had done to their music. I shall here ralate au anecdote which I consider quite characteristic. A Pundit Brah min, or Hindoo doctor, whom I introduced into my aga's service, would fain pronounce his panegyric ; and after comparing him to the greatest conquerors the world has ever known, and mak ing for the purpose of flattery a hundred nauseous and imperti nent observations, he concluded his harangue in these words, ut tered with all conceivable seriousness : \" When my lord, you place your foot in the stirrup, marching at the head of your ca valry, the earth trembles under your footsteps * the eight ele phants, on whose heads it is borne, finding it impossible to sup port the extraordinary presure.\" The conclusion of this speech produced the effect that might be expected. I could not avoid laughiug, but I endeavoured, with a grave countenance, to tell my aga, who^e risibility was just as muc':: excited, that it be hoved him to be cautious how he mounted on horseback and created earthquakes, which often caused so much mischief. \" Yes, my friend,\" he answered without hesitation, \" and that is the reason why I generally choose to be carried in a palan quin.\" The grand hall of the am-kas opens into a more retired cham ber, called the gosel-kauay, or the place to wash in. Few per-"], [41, "Private reception room op AcntiNGKEB*?. 11 sons are permitted to enter this room, the court of which is not so large as that of the am-kas. The hall is, however, very hand some, spacious, gilt aud painted, and raised four or five French feet from the pavement, like a large estrade. It is in this place that the king, seated in a chair, his omrahs standing around him grants more private audiences to his officers, receives their re ports, and deliberates on important affairs of state. Every om rah incurs the same pecuniary penalty for omitting to attend this assembly in the evening, as for failing to be present at tho am-kas iu the morning. The only grandee whose daily attend ance is dispensed with is my aga Danechmend-Khaii, who en joys this exemption in consequence of hi ' p-e* a man of letters, and of the time he necessarily devotes to his studies or to for eign affairs ; but on Wednesdays, the day ofthe week ou which he mounts guard, he attends in the same manner as other om rahs. This custom of meeting twice a day is very ancient ; and no omrah can reasonably complain that it is binding, since the king seems to consider it as obligatory upon himself as upon his courtiers to be present ; nothing but urgent business, or serious bodily affliction, preventing him from appearing at the two as semblies. In his late alarming illness Aureng-Zebe was carried every day to the one or the other, if not to both. He felt the necessity of shewing himself at least once during the twenty-four hours ; for his disorder was of so dangerous a character that his absence, though only for one day, might have thrown the whole kingdom into trouble and insurrection and caused the closing of every shop. Although the king, when seated in the hall of gosel-kanay, is engaged about such affairs as I have mentioned, yet the same shows are exhibited for the most part as in the am-kas ; but be ing late in the day, and the adjoining court being small, the ca valry of the omrahs does not pass in review. There is this pecu liar ceremony in the evening assembly, that all the mansebdars who are on guard pass before the king to salute him with much form. The kours move pompously iu their front : these are sil ver figures, beautifully made, carried at the end of large silver sticks : two of them represent large fish ; two others, a horrible and fantastic animal called eiedeha ; others are the figures of two lions ; others of two bauds * aud others of scales ; and several"], [42, "12 The apartments facing the River as toft were in Aurungzebb's time. more which I cannot here enumerate, to which the Indians at tach a certain mystic meaning. Among the kours and the man sebdars, are mixed many gourze-berdars, or macebearcrs, chosen for their tall and handsome persons, and whose business it is to preserve order iu assemblies, and to carry the king's orders, and execute his commands with the utmost speed. It would afford me plcasuie to conduct you to the seraglio, as I have introduced you into other parts of the fortress. But who is tho traveller that can describe from ocular observation the in terior of that building ? I have sometimes gone into it when the king was absent from Delhi, and once pretty fur I thought, for the purpose of giving my professional advice in the case of a great lady so extremely ill that she could not he moved to the outward gate, according to the custom observed upon similar occasions ; but a kashmire shawl covered my head, hanging like a large scarf down to my feet, and an eunuch led me by the baud, as if I had been a blind man. You must be content, therefore, with such a general description as I haye received from some of the eunuchs. They inform me that the seraglio contains beautiful apartments, separated, aud more or less spacious and splendid, according to the rank and income of the females. Nearly every chamber has its reservoir of running water at the door ; on every side arc gardens, delightful alleys, shady retreats, streams, jets d'eau, grottoes, deep excavations that afford shelter from the sun by day, loft}* divans and terraces, on which to sleep coolly at night. Within the walls of this en chanting place, iu fine, no oppressive or inconvenient heat is felt. The eunuchs speak with extravagant praise of a * small tower, facing tho river, which is covered with plates of gold, in the same manner as the two towers of Agra ; and its apartments are decorated with gold and azure, exquisite paintings and magnificent mirrors. Before taking our final leave of the fortress, 1 wish to recall your attention to the am-kas, which I am desirous to describe, as I saw it during certain annual festivals ; especially on the occasion of the rejoicings that took place after the ter mination of the war. Never did I witness a more extraordinary scene. * The Shah-boorj."], [43, "TnK Peacock throne. 13 The king appeared seated upon his throne, at the end of the great hall, in the most magnificent attire. His vest was of white and delicately flowered satin, with a silk and gold embroidery of tiro finest texture. The turban, of gold cloth, had an aigrette whose foot was composed of diamonds of an extraordinary swso and value, besides ail oriental topaz, which may be pronounced unparalleled, exhibiting a lustre like tlie sun. A necklace of immense pearls, suspended from his neck, reached to the stomach, in the same mauner as many pagans wear their strings of beads. The throne was supported by six massy feet, said to be of solid gold, sprinkled over with rubies, emeralds, and diamonds. 1 can not tell you with accuracy the number or value of this vast col lection of precious stones, because no person may approach suffi ciently near to reckon them, or judge of their water and clearness ; but I can assure you that there is a confusion of diamonds, as well as other jewels, and that the throne, to the best of my recollection, is valued at four crores of rupees. I observed elsewhere that a lack is one hundred thousand rupees, aud that a crore is a bundled lacks ; so that the throne is estimated at forty millions of rupees. It was constructed by Shah-Jehan, the father of Aureng-Zebe, for the purpose of displaying the im mense quantity of precious stones accumulated successively in the treasury from the spoils of ancient rajahs and Patans, and the annual presents to the monarch which every omrah is bound to make on certain festivals. The construction and workmanship ofthe throne are not correspondent with the materials ; but two peacocks, covered with jewels and pearls, are well conceived and executed. They were made by a workman of astonishing powers, a Frenchman by birth, who, after defrauding several of the princes of Europe, by means of false gems, which he fabricated with peculiar skill, sought refuge in the Great Mogul's court where he made his fortune. At the foot of the throne were assembled all the omrahs in splendid apparel upon an estrade surrounded by a silver railing and covered by a spacious canopy of brocade with deep fringes of gold. The pillars of the hall were hung with brocades of a gold ground, and flowered satin, canopies were raised over the whole expanse of the extensive apartment fastened with red silken cords, from whioh were sus pended large tassels of silk aud gold. The floor was covered"], [44, "14 Festivals of ancient davs. entirely with carpets ofthe richest silk, of immense length aud breadth. A tent, called the aspek, was pitched outside, larger than the hall, to which it joined by the top. It spread over half the court and was completely enclosed by a great balustrade covered with plates of silver. Its supporters were pillars overlaid with silver, three of which were as thick and as high as the mast of a bark, the others smaller. The outside of this magnificent tent was red, and the inside lined with elegant Masulipatam chintzes, figured expressly for that very purpose with flowers so natural and colours so vivid, that the tent seemed to be encom passed with real parterres. As to the arcade galleries round the court, every omrah had received orders to decorate one of them at his own expense, and there appeared a spirit of emulation who should best acquit himself to the monarch's satisfaction. Consequently all the arcades and galleries were covered from top to bottom with brocade, aud the pavement with rich carpets. On the third day of the festival, the king, and after him seve ral oniiahs, were weighed with a great deal of ceremony in large scales, which as well as the weights, are, they say, of solid gold. I recollect that all the courtiers expressed much joy when it was found that Aureng-Zebe weighed two pounds more than the year preceding. Similar festivals are held every year, but never before were they celebrated with equal splendour and expence. It is thought that the principal inducement with the king for the extraordinary magnificence displayed en this occasion was to afford to the merchants an opportunity of disposing of the quantities of bro cades, which the war had for four oi* five years prevented them from selling. The expence incurred by the omrahs was considerable, but a portion of it fell ultimately on the common cavaliers, whom the omrahs obliged to purchase the b'*ocades to be made up into vests. An ancient custom attends these anniversary days of rejoicing, not at all agreeable to the omrahs. They are expected to make a han home present to the king, more or less valuable according to the amount of their pay. Some of them, indeed, take that opportunity of presenting gifts of extraordinary magnificence,"], [45, "Curious national customs. 15 sometimes for the sake of an ostentatious display, sometimes to divert the king from instituting an enquiry into the exactions committed in their official situations or governments, and some times to gain the favour of the king, and by that means obtain an increase of salary. Some present fine pearls, diamonds, eme ralds or rubies ; others offer vessels of gold set with precious stones; others again give a quantity of gold coins, each worth about a pistole and a half. During a festival of this kind Au reng-Zebe having paid a visit to Jafer-khan, not as his vizier but as a kiusman, ou the pretext that he wished to see a house which he lately erected, the vizier made a present to the king of gold coins to the amount of one hundred thousand crowns, some hand some pearls, and a ruby, which was estimated at forty thousand crowns, but which Shah-Jehan, who understood better than any man the value of every kind of precious stone, discovered to be worth less than five hundred, to the great confusion of the principal jewellers, who iu this instance, had been completely de ceived. A whimsical kind of fair is sometimes held during these festivi ties in the mahil, or royal seraglio : it is conducted by the hand somest and most engaging of the wives of the omrahs and prin cipal mansebdars. The articles exhibited are beautiful brocades, rich embroideries of the newest fashion, turbans elegantly worked on cloth of gold, fine muslins worn by women of quality, and other articles of high price. These bewitching females act the part of traders, while the purchasers are the king, the begums or princesses, aud other distinguished ladies of the seraglio. If any omrah's wife happens to have a handsome daughter, she never fails to accompany her mother, that she may be seen by the king and become known to the begums. The charm of this fair is the most ludicrous manner in which the king makes his bargains, frequently disputiug for the value of a penny. He pretends that the good lady cannot possibly be in earnest, that the article is much too dear, that it is not equal to that he can find elsewhere, and that positively he will give no more than such a price. The woman, on the other hand, endeavours to sell to the best advan tage, and- when the king perseveres in offering what she considers too little money, high words frequently ensue, and she fearlessly tells him that he is a mere merchant of suow, a person ignorant"], [46, "16 El.ErilANT COMBATS. ofthe value of merchandize; that her articles are too good for him, and that he had better go where he can suit himself better. Tlie begums betray, if possible, a still greater anxiety to be served cheaply ; high words are heard on every side, and tho loud and scurrilous quarrels of the sellers and buyers create a complete farce. But sooner or later they agree upon the price, the princesses as well as the king buy right and left, pay in ready money, and often slip out of their hands as if by accident, a few g dd instead of silver rupees, intended as a compliment to the fair merhant or her pretty daughter. The present is received in the same unconscious manner, and the whole ends amidst witty jests and good humour. ' \u2022 The festivals generally conclude with an amusement unknown in Europe, \u2014 a combat between two elephants ; which takes place in the presence of all the people on the Sandy space near the river : the king, the principal ladies of the court and the omrahs, viewing tho spectacle from different apartments in the fortress. A wall of earth is raised three or four French sect wide and five or six high. The two ponderous beasts meet one another face to face, on opposite sides of the wall, each having a couple of riders, that the place of the man who sits on the shoulders for the pur pose of guiding the elephant with a lnrgc iron hook, may imme diately be supplied if he should be thrown down. The riders amimate the elephants either by soothing words, or by chiding them as cowards, and urge them ou with their heels, until the poor creatures approach the wall and are brought to the attack. The shock is tremendous, and it appears surprising that they ever survive the drendful wounds and blows inflicted with their teeth, their heads and their trunks. There are frequent pauses during the sight ; it is suspended and renewed ; and the mud wall being at length thrown down, the stronger or more courageous elephant passes on and attaeks his opponent, and putting him to flight, pursues and fastens upon Irish with so much obstinacy, that the animals can be separated only by means of cherkys, or fire-works, which are made to explode between them ; for they are naturally timid, and have a particular dread of fire, which is the reason why elephants have been used with so very little advantage in armies since the use of fire-arms. The boldest come from Ceylon, but"], [47, "Elephant fights. 17 none are employed in war which have not been regularly trained, nnd accustomed for years to the discharge of muskets close to their heads and the bursting of crackers between their legs. The sight of these noble creatures is attended with much cruel ty. It frequently happens that some of the riders are trodden Under foot, aid killed on the spot, the elephant having always cunning enough to feel the importance of dismounting the rider of his adversary, whom he therefore endeavours to strike down with his trunk. So imminent is the danger considered, that on the day of combat the unhappy men tike the same formal leave of their wives and children as if condemned to death. They are somewhat consoled by the reflection that if their lives should be preserved, and the king be pleased with their conduct not only will their pay be augmented, but a sack of peyssas (equal to fifty francs) will be presented to them the moment they alight from the elephant. They have also the satisfaction of knowing that in the event of their death, the pay will be conti nued to the widows, and that their sons will be appointed to the same situation. The mischief A-ith which this amusement is attend ed does not always terminate with the death of the rider : it often happens that some ofthe spectators are knocked down and trampled upon by the elephants, or by the crowd ; for the rush is terrible when, to avoid the infuriated combatants, men and horses in confu sion take to flight. The second time I witnessed this exhibition I owed my safety entirely to the goodness of my horse and the exer tions of my two servants. But it is time we should quit the fortress, and return to the city, where I omitted to describe tsvo edifices worthy of notice. The first is the principal mosque, which is conspicuous at a great distance, being situated on the top a rock in the centre of the town. The surface of the rock was previously levelled, and around it a space is cleared sufficiently large to form a handsome square, where four fine long streets terminate, opposite to the four sides of the mosque; one, opposite to the principal entrance, in front of the building ; a second, to the back of the temple ; and the two others, to the gates that are in the middle of the two sides. The ascent to the three gates, is by means of five and twenty or thirty steps, of beautiful large stone, which are continued the whole"], [48, "18 Bernier's description of the Jama Musjed. length ofthe front and sides. The back part is cased over to the height of the rock, with large and handsome hewn stone, which hides its inequalities and tends to give a noble appearance to the building. The three entrances, composed of marble, are magnificent, and their large doors arc overlaid with highly finished plates of copper or brass. Above the principal gate which greatly exceeds the others in grandeur of appearance, there are sevoral small turrets of white marble that produce a fine effect ; and at the back part of tho mosque are seen three capacious domes, builLalso of white mar ble, within and without. The middle dome is much larger and loftier than the other two. The extremity of the mosque alone is covered : the space between the three domes and the principal entrance is without any roof ; the extreme heat of the climate rendering such an opening absolutely necessary. The whole is paved of large slabs of marble. 1 grant that this building is not. constructed according to those rules of architecture which we seem to think ought to be implicitly followed ; yet I can per ceive no fault that offends the taste ; every part appears well contrived, properly executed, and correctly proportioned. I am satisfied that even iu Paris, a church erected after the model of this temple, would lie admired, were it only for its singular style of architecture and its extraordinary appearance. With the ex ception ofthe three great domes, and the numerous turrets, which are all of white marble, the mosque is of a red colour, as if built with large slabs of red m irl do ; although it consists of a species of stone cut with great facility, and apt to exfoliate after a certain time The natives pretend that the quarries from which it is tak en, reproduce *the stone by degrees : this, if true, is very remark able ; but whether or not they rightly attribute it to the water which fills the quarries every year, I cannot decide. The king repairs to tho mosque every Friday, for the purpose of prayer ; that day corresponding in muhammedan countries to our Sunday. The streets through which he passes are watered to lay the dust and temper the heat : two or three hundred mus keteers form an avenue from the gate of the fortress, and as many more line both sidos of a wide street leading directly to the mosque. The muskets of these soldiers are small but well finished, and have a sort of large scirlet covering with a little streamer on the top. Five or six hoi semen, well mounted, are also ready at"], [49, "The Begum Saheb's caravanserai. 19 thc fortress gate, and their duty is to clew the way for the king, keeping, however, at a considerable distance m advance, lest he should be incommoded by their dust. These preparations com pleted, his majesty loaves the fortress, sometimes on an elephant, decorated with rich trappings, and a canopy supported by painted and gilt pillars ; and sometimes in a throne gleaming with azure and gold, placed on alifctei covered with scarlet or brocade, which eight chosen inen, in handsome attire, carry on their shoulders. A body of onir.ilis Follow the king, some on horseback, and others ill palanquins ; and among the dinrahs are seen a great number of minscbdars, aud bearers of silver maces, whom I have elsewhere describe,!. I cannot say that this train resembles the pompous pro cessions, or (which is a more appropriate term) the masquerades of the Grand Seignior, or the martial retinues of European monarchs : its magnificence is of a different character ; but it is not therefore the less royal. The other edifice in Delhi to which I would draw your attention, is what they call thc caravansary of the princess, built by the celebrated Begum-Saheb, Shah-Jehan's eldest dam-li ter, of whom I have so much spoken in my history of the late war. Not only this princess, but all the omralis who wished to gain the favour of the old monarch, embellished the new city at their own expence. The caravansary is a large square with arcades, like our Place Royale, except that the arches are separated from each other by partitions, and have small chambers at their inner extremities. Above the arcades runs a gallery all round the building, into which open the same number of chambers as there are below. This place is the rendezvous of the. rich Persian Usbec, and other foreign merchants, who in general may be accommodated with empty chambers, in which they remain with perfect security, the gate of the caravansary being closed .at night. If iu Paris we had a score of similar structures, distribut ed in different parts of the city, strangers on their first arrival would be less embarrassed than at present to find a safe and reasonable lodging. They might remain in them a few days until they'had seen their acquaintance, and looked out at leisure for more convenient apartments. .Such places would become ware houses for all kinds of merchandize and thc general resort of foreign merchants."], [50, "20 Historic Vicissitudes of Delhi. About five hundred years ago, the Emperor Mahomed Toghluk issued orders, that the whole of the inhabitants of Delhi, with their cattle and effects, should migrate to Dowlutabad ; but shortly after a rebellion broke out in the province of Mooltan, which obliged the Emperor to go in person to quell it ; this being effected, he returned towards Delhi, when those who had been forced to leave their homes to settle at Dowlutabad, began to desert, and to prevent this, Mahomed Toghluk took up his abode in Delhi, and resided there for two years ; after which he again re solved to make Dowlutabad his Capital, and a second time forced the whole of the inhabitants to proceed there, \" leaving the noble Metropolis of Delhi a resort for owls and a dwell ing place for the beasts of the desert.\" After a time tbe Emperor gave permission to such as were desirous to return to Delhi, and a great number made the attempt, but thou sands perished on the road of starvation, and the survivors, when they reached their destination, found a famine raging in the city, so that bnt few persons could obtain the necessa/ ries of life. Probably no other Capital in the world has undergone more changes than Delhi since it was founded, until the close of the reign ofthe unfortunate Shah Aulum, when its independence may be said to have terminated. When in the height of its splendour, the city is said to have covered a space of twenty square miles ; and after making due al lowance for the usual exaggeration of oriental description, ample remains to prove that at the period of its greatest prosperity, it was one of the largest, wealthiest and most splendid cities that ever existed. To this cause may be as cribed the ravages which have given it so conspicuous a place in the history of conquest. From the time of Mahom ed Ghoory, to the year 180 i, the city of Delhi was many times besieged, and generally given up almost immediately on tbe appearance of the enemy. Such was the case when Timour, having defeated Mahomed Toghluk, on the plain of"], [51, "Invasion of Nadir Shah. 21 Ferozabad, one of the suburbs of old Delhi, the chief men of the city crowded to his camp to tender their submission, whicb was accepted : \u2014 but some of the nobles and rich mer chants shut themselves up in their houses, and refused to pay their portion ot the ransom whicb had been levied by the conqueror. The Magistrates applied to Timour for troops to enforce their authority, but the arrival of the Mo gul soldiers created confusion, plundering ensued, aud the city was for five days the scene of great disorder. The Hindoos seeing their women disgraced, and their wealth seized by tbe soldiers, shut the city gates, set fire to their houses, murdered their wives and children, and rushed upon their enemies ; this brought on a general massacre, tbe gates were forced, and whole Mogul army obtained admit tance ; when tlie citizens seeing resistance to be useless, threw down their arms and submitted to their fate. The accounts given of the booty obtained from the city are in credible ; but there can be no doubt it was very large, and the number of citizens who were carried away captives was extremely great. For two months the city suffered from pestilence and famine, after which such of tbe inhabitants who had fled returned to their homes. A similar tragedy again occurred one hundred aud fifteen years ago, when .Na dir Shah having obtained a complete victory over the Em peror Mahomed Shah at Kiunaul, the latter was compelled to tender his submission, and the conqueror obliged him to march in his train to Delhi, where he took up his residence in the royal palace. Nadir Shah appears to have taken every precaution for the protection of the inhabitants, but was not successful in conciliating them, for on the second day after the occupation of the city it was reported that Nadir Shah was dead, when the inhabitants fell upon the Persian troops who were scattered over the city to maintain peace, and many became sacrifices to the popular fury. Those in authority, so far from attempting to repress the tumult, gave up to bo murdered, the guards, who had been furnished to protect their palaces. When Nadir Shah was informed of"], [52, "22 The massacre, loss of the Peacock throne. the insurrection, he did all in his power to quell it, but at length one of his chiefs having fallen at his side, from a shot directed against himself, he gave way to his passions, and ordered a general massacre of the inhabitants. The num ber who were killed is variously estimated at from eight to one hundred and fifty thousand ; but tradition unanimously states it to have been not less than one hundred thousand. It is said that during the whole time of its perpetration, Na dir Shah sat in gloomy silence in the mosque of Roosrrurfc ood-Dowlah, situated in the Chandney Chowk, where the Emperor and his nobles at length ventured to approach him, and Mahomed Shah besought Nadir to spare the lives of his subjects. The tyrant being satiated with the carnage, is sued an order to stop the massacre, He then took posses sion of the imperial treasures, amongst which was the cele brated peacock throne, valued alone at Nadir Shah, after having levied contributions from the provinces, was at last satisfied with the fruits of his conquest, but be fore returning to his own dominions, he reinstated Mahomed Shah, as Emperor, and married his son to a princess of the Timour family. After a residence of nearly two mouths he departed from Delhi, taking with him nearly ten millions sterling in money, besides gold and silver plate worth seve ral millions more, jewels of inestimable value, valuable fur niture, rich goods of every description, elephants, camels and horses, and some hundreds of the most skilful of the artisans and workmen for which Delhi has long been celebrated. Only seventeen years afterwards, in the reign of Alam ghir the second, Delhi was taken by Ahmed Shah Durani, when nearly all the horrors of Nadir Shah's invasion were again suffered by the unfortunate inhabitants. Shortly af ter the city was occupied by a Mahratta army under Rago ba, the brother of the Peishwa, and the fortified palace was besieged and held out for more than a month. The Mahrat tas very shortly after under Sedashco Rao Bhao, again took, Delhi after a short defence. The Bhao caused the shrines,"], [53, "23 Mahratta invasion and spoliation of the Dewan Khas. tombs and palaces to be stripped of such of the rich orna ments as had escaped the cupidity of the Persians and Af ghans : he caused the silver ceiling to be taken down from the Dewan Khas in the palace, and the metal coined into se venteen lacs of Rupees, and he also seized the throne and whatever else remained in the palace in the shape of plate or ornaments. In the year 17-35 the Emperor Ahmed Shah was deposed, and deprived of his sight, by Ghazi-ood-deen Khan, an officer of high rank and ambitious character. He placed the next in descent of the house of Timour on the throne, under the title of Alumghir the second, but retained the power and the revenues of the empire in his own hands. The Emperor soon tired of being a mere puppet in the hands of his Vizier, endeavored to throw off the yoke, by instigating the celebrated Ahmed Abdallee to invade the empire, wdiich he readily undertook with such a force as rendered any hopes of successful resis tance futile on the part of the Vizier, who went out to welcome the invader, whom he conducted into Delhi. Ghazi ood-deen was speedily removed from the viziership, which was conferred on Ali Ghour, the eldest son of the emperor, but the deposed minister contrived to ingratiate himself into the favor of Ahmed, who ordered that he should be reinstated in his office. The emperor remonstrated against this arbitrary com mand, but was powerless, and therefore obliged to submit to the indignity of seeing the badge of the vizierate forcibly taken from the prince and bestowed on Ghazi-ood-deen, who became more absolute and insolent than ever. After the departure of Ahmed Abdallee, Ali Ghour fled to Jhujgur, where be raised forces for his defence against the designs of the Vizier, who endeavoured to seize the person of the Prince, but after a stout resistance, he made his escape, and took refuge at the Court ofthe Nawab Soojah-ood-Dowlab, the ruler of Oude, who persuaded him to make an attempt to wrest Bengal from Jaffier Ali Khan. This brought the"], [54, "2. Discord and gradual Decay of ttte Mogul Dynasty, contact witu the English. prince into contact with the English, who were obliged to maintain Jaffier Ali Khan in the possession of the Govern- ment to which they had raised him, and Colonel Clive soon forced Ali Ghour to make a precipitate retreat to the province of Allahabad, where most of his followers abandoned him, and he was reduced to extreme distress. In the year 1795, Ghrzi-ood-deen Khan assassinated the emperor Aulumghire, and caused one of the descendants of the youngest son of Aurungzebe to be proclaimed emperor, under the name of Shah Jehan the Second. The murderer did not however derive any advantage by his atrocious cruelty, for Ahmed Abdallee making himself master of the capital, the Vizier fled to Agra, but being closely pursued, he retired into the country of the Jauts, where he remained in hiding for the rest of his life. Ali Ghour now assumed the imperial title, under the name of Shah Aulum, and appointed his friend Nawab Soojah-ood Dowlah, Vizier. At this time, having failed in further attempts upon Bengal, he was reduced to the necessity of surrendering himself to the English, who assigned him the city of Allahabad for his residence, with the province of Corah, and twenty six lacs of rupees a year for his maintenance. He now remained five years in qniet, under the protection of the British Government, during which time Nujee-ool Dowlah, his viceroy, governed with great satisfaction to the inhabitants of the city of Delhi, and also with due regard to the interests of the emperor. Shah Aulum was at last persuaded to return to Delhi, and accord- ingly on the twenty fifth of December 1771, he made his entry with great pomp, into the imperial city, amidst the acclamations of a vast concourse of people. But he soon found cause to regret not having attended to the warnings of the British Government, and the entreaties of his minis- ter, not to place himself in the hands of the Mahrattas, who merely wished to make him the tool of their ambitious pro jects, for they quickly gave abundant proofs of their arro gance, rapacity and treachery, forcing the abject monarch"], [55, "Sii.ui Aulum seeks aid ov the Mahrattas. 25 not only to pardon the rebel Zabita Khan, but to raise him to the high rank of Amecr-ool-Omrah, in consideration of a large sum of money paid to them by the latter. After the death of the faithful minister, Mirza Nujuff Khan, the Court of Delhi became the scene of anarchy and confusion, from the perpetual contentions and intrigues of the rival chiefs | and the power of the wretched monarch declined so rapidly, that he was obliged not only to remain \"a passive spectator of these commotions, but to receive into favor, and to honor with distinction, men recking from assassination and stained with tho blood of their fellow citizens.\" Their insolence and arrogance, particularly that of Afrasiab Khan, was such, that the unhappy Shall Aulum formed the resolution of again seeking the protection of tho Mahrattas, and the em peror removed his Court to Agra, where Afrasiab Khan was assassinated at the instigation, it is said, of Madliajee Scindi ah, upon whom .the vacant office of Ameer-ool-Omrah was conferred. The death of the minister was soon followed by that of Zabita Khan, whose son and successor, Gholaum Caudir, immediately on coming into possession of his estate, broke out into open rebellion, in which he was secretly en couraged by the nazir of the household. In addition to this defection, the Raja of Jynugur asserted his independence, and defeated the combined Mahratta and Mogul forces un der Scindiah, who sought safety in flight; this gave an opportunity to Gholaum Caudir to approach the city, and he encamped on the opposite bank of the Jumna. Tho Governor, instead of making arrangements for the defence of the city, sent troops across to attack the rebels, but they sus tained a shameful defeat, and the Governor abandoned the city. In this exigency, the Begum Sumroo, and a few other faithful adherents of the emperor, behaved with such firm ness and zeal that Gholaum Caudir, after having obtained admittance to the royal presence, and demanded the vizier ship, was obliged to retire, disappointed, to his camp, hreath iu\"* vengeance against his opponents, and he immediately"], [56, "2C Plot of Gholaum Caudir for toe deposition of the Emperor. commenced bombarding the palace. At this time, the heir apparent, prince Mirza Juwaun Bukt was hastening by forced marches to the relief of his father. Of this the treacherous Nazir was aware, and recommended Gbolaum Caudir to make his submission before tlie arrival of the prince. The Emperor at first refused to receive it, but the crafty Nazir at length prevailed on him to grant a royal pardon, and Gholaum Caudir instantly returned to Saharun- pore, just at the time tho prince arrived to witness the weakness of his father, and the triumph of the rebel. Prince Mirza Juwaun Bukht was immediately invested with the management of affairs, but the Emperor did not place that confidence in him which he deserved, and allowed himself to be imposed upon by the basest insinuations against the loyalty of his son, whom the wily Nazir represented as having designs upon the throne. The prince, perceiving that he had lost the favor of his father, retired to Benares ; where a few months after he died of fever. Gholaum Caudir Khan and Ismael Beg, another rebellious chief, learning from the Nazir that the Emperor had written to Scindiah for assis tance, formed the diabolical design of deposing the Emperor and plundering the royal palace. They marched towards Delhi, and obtained possession of the city, palace, and per son of the Emperor without any resistance on the part of the Mahratta garrison. A treaty was drawn up by the rebel chiefs, by which Gholaum Caudir Khan was to have the sole direction of affairs, and he pledged himself by oath to defend the Emperor and his interests against all opponents. The deluded Monarch, against the honest and urgent advice of Seetul Dass, the treasurer of the household, ratified the trea ty, which was no sooner done than the guards were disarm ed, the officers imprisoned, and the palace completely filled with the rebel troops. Shah Aulum remonstrated, but his complaints were treated with cruel mockery, and after many indignities he was compelled to quit the throne, a son of tho Emperor Ahmed being raised to the imperial diguity under"], [57, "Deprives TnE emperor of SKSHT. 27 the title of Jehan Shah. When Gholaum Caudir sound the treasury exhausted, and that the riches of the palace fell far short of Ids expectations, he caused the hapless, dethroned Shah Aulum to be brought beforo him in the hall of audi ence, and ordered him to confess where he had concealed his wealth. The aged man pleaded in vain the poverty of him self and his family, and protested that nothing had been concealed. The miscreant, unsatisfied with these assertions, threatened the Emperor with the loss of his sight if he did not confess. To which the unfortunate old man replied \" What: will yon rob me of those eyes which for a period of sixty years have lieen incessautly employed in studying tlie sacred Koran ?' Unmoved by this, he stuck his dagger into one of the venerable man's eyes and ordered one of the Emperor's servants to put out the other eye, but on the man's refusing, he struck off his head with one blow of his sword, and the next to whom the command was given, d<. prived the hapless Shah Aulum of sight. But the. day of re tribution was at hand, for Scindiah, on , hearing of all th' s\u00a3 horrors, ordered his army, under Rana Khan, to march of the Capital, where.it arrived so speedily, that Gholaum Caudir * had scarcely time to escape from the palace by a private pa.-. sage, and retire to Meerut, taking with him Jehan Shah, other members of the royal family, and the faithless Nazir. whom he had deprived of his wealth and kept a close pri soner. Rana Khan and the Mahratta army followed the fugitive to Meerut, and invested the fort so closely, that the garrison began to mutiny. Gholaum Caudir, to avoid being given up to the enemy, made a sally at the head of five hun dred cavalry, and managed to cut his way through tlie whole Jiue ofthe besiegers aud effect his escape ; but his followers .seeing the desperate state of his fortunes, quickly abandon ed him, and he was soon left without a single attendant.

No threats could induce him to confess where he had secreted the plunder ho had carried off. Ran a Khan ordered him to bo loaded with manacles, and confined in a. cage at the head of the army, from whom he received every insult and indignity the soldiers could inflict upon him. His e}res were torn from their sockets, a.nd his nose, ears, hands, and feet were gradually cut off, till the wretch sunk under his sufferings. The Nazir also received the punish ment clue to his perfidious conduct, iii inciting this rebellion, for as soon as Scindiah had resumed the reins of Government at Delhi, he caused the wretched man to be trodden to death under the feet of an elephant. After these acts of -retribu tive justice had been executed, the blind monarch was re enthroned with much pomp and ceremony, in the Dewan Khas. The inhabitants of Delhi, notwithstanding they felt keenly the sufferings and indignities heaped upon the aged Emperor, were so overawed by the troops of the rebel, that they ventered no further than to show their discontent by lamentations and invectives against the usurper, and reproa ches against the English for not rendering assistance. Although Sb* \u00bbh Afllum was nominally restored to the sover eignty, Scindiah took care to retain all the power in his own hands, and it is said that out of the large revenues of the Emperor, only fifty thousand Rupees were allowed annual ly, for the support of the Emperor and his immense house hold, so that they were often in want of the necessaries of life. In the year 1803, the British Government assembled a large army under Lord Lake, in the vicinity of Kanouj, in order to be prepared for the expected ruptuie with the Mahrattas, and their ally Monsieur Perron, who command ed a force consisting of about 43,000 men and 4C4 guns, exclusive ofthe troops employed in garrisons: the Irregular Infantry, Mahrattas, &c. Hostilities at length commenced, and the, English army encamped at Coel, where Monsieur Perron was strongly posted.

Monsieur Perron with his body guard retired to Agra, leav ing Colonel Pedrou to defend the fort of Allyghur to the last extremity. Lord Lake summoned Colonel Pedron to sur render the fort, but he, in ohdedicnce to the orders he had received, determined to defend the place, which was hitherto considered impregnable, but after a most vigourous defence, it fell into the hands of the British army, the number of guns taken was two hundivd and eighty one, besides large .stoics of powder and shot, and some treasure. Immediately after the capture of Allyghur, Monsieur Perron wrote to the Commander-in-Chief, informing him that he had retired from the service of Scindiah, and asking permission to remove with his family aud property to Lucknow, which was com plied with, and the English were thus rid of one of their most dangerous enemies. The English army now marched towards Delhi, where, on the 11 th of September 1803, was fought a battle, with a division of Monsieur Perron's troops under the command of Monsieur Louis Bourquien, whose force amounted to nineteen thousand, of whom six thousand were cavalry, while that of the English was no more than four thousand five hundred. Notwithstanding the disparity of numbers, the intensity of the heat, and their having been under arms for seventeen hours, the English army overcame every obstacle, and the enemy were put to the rout, abandoning all their artillery and stores to the vic tors. Amongst the spoils were sixty eight guns, sixty one tumbrils of ammunition, and two tumbrils of treasure. After the battle, which could be distinctly seen from the towers of Delhi, the army encamped on the banks of the Jumna, opposite the city. The result of the action was the evacuation of the city and fort by the enemy*, and Monsieur Louis Bourquien, with four other French officers, was obliged to solicit British protection from the effects of popular re sentment. The Emperor Shah Aulum, immediately after the battle, sent a message to the Commander-in Chief, ex pressive of joy at the victory which had been obtained over"], [60, "30 Defence op Delhi by Ochterlony aoaisst IIoLK.\\n. his oppressors, aud soliciting the aid and protection of th9 British Government, which was readily promised by his Ex cellency. The deliverance of their Emperor from the com bined tyranny ofthe French Officers and the Mahrattas. was the cause of great rejoicing to the inhabitants of Delhi, and an immense concourse of people assembled to witness the procession of the Commander-in-Chief, when lie went to pay a visit of ceremony to the Emperor iu the palace. Tho British Government adopted the necessary measures for the support of the Emperor and his family, and the security of the capital. Towards the close of the year 18(14, Ilolkar besieged Delhi with brigades of regular infantry, and a largo train of artillery, and the operations were pressed on with great exertion, in the hope that he might obtain possession ofthe person ofthe Emperor before the English could come to his rescue. The city was gallantly defended by Colonel Oehterlony, the British Resident at the Court ot Delhi, and by Colonel Burn, who commanded the garrison. On the first approach of Holkar, Colonel Oehterlony called in the troops from Saharunpore, Rohtuk, and Paueeput. The walls of the capital were at this time in a very dilapidated state, but Colonel Oehterlony selected such of the bastions as ap peared most commanding, and caused them to be widened and strengthened for the reception of artillery. But little time was afforded for these preparations, yet two redoubts were constructed at the Ajmere and Turcoman gates, which were afterwards of of essential service. On the morning of the seventh of October, Holkar's horse made their appear ance before Delhi, and the English troops prepared to retire within the walls, a party being sent off to reconnoitre the force and position of the cuemy. Had an attack In en at once made, great advantages might have been obtained, but the troops refused to follow their officers aud retreated to the city, while a party who were sta.tioned at the old fort deserted. The next morning the infantry and artillery of Holkar arrived, and a strong detachment commenced a heavy cannonade against the south east angle of the city wall, and"], [61, "OcIITERLOXY's DEFENCE OF DELHI CONTINUED. 31 thirty or forty feet of the parapet was levelled, but more guns, hajv|ing been .sent thither, the enemy were compelled to withdraw. During the night they erected breaching batteries, which completely destroyed the parapet. Within the walls strenuous exertions were made to repair the breaches and Strengthen the defences on that side ol the city. On the evening of the tenth, a sally was made by 400 uieu under seven officers, who succeeded iu obtaining possession of the battery, and having spiked the guns retired with but little loss, in the course of the same day a battery was erect ed by the besieged toward the south east bastion, which, kept the enemy in check, but next morning, they commenced a heavy fire from the battery which had been stormed the evening before ; they were however soon silenced by a well directed fire from our new battery, and the whole moved off to carry ou their operations against the southern face of the city, where their heaviest guns and large bodies of infantry were posted, under cover of gardens and ruins. They at length effected a breach between the Turcoman and Ajmere gates, but the activity of the besieged soon prevented all communication by it to the city, except along the ramparts. During the thirteenth all was quiet, and a serious attack was consequently expected, and the garrison were kept in a state of constant guard ; nor were these precautions unnecessary, for at break of day on the fourteenth, all the enemy's guns opened upon the city, and under cover of the fire a large body of infantry, with scaling ladders, made an assault on the Lahore gate, but were repulsed with considerable loss. In order to distract our attention from the real point of at tack a feint was made, as if they intended the assault to be made at the Ajmere gate, and the officer commanding that post was mortally wounded by a cannon ball. During the day a demonstration was made by the enemy of an attack towards the Cashmere gate, but the besieged soon prepared to receive them by mounting some guns on the bastions on that side, aud a six pounder was placed on the Lahore and"], [62, "32 Seige raised.

DESCRIPTION OF DELHI. The modern city of Delhi io situated in Latitude 28\u00b0 38' North and Longitude 77\u00b0 13v East, on the western banks of the river Jumna. It was founded by the Emperor Shah Jehan, about the year 1 620 A. D. and by him named Shah jehanabad, but it is now almost always styled after the name of the reputed founder of the ancient city. The materials were for the most part supplied from the ruins of the old ci ties. It was originally encompassed by walls of brick, and to some extent fortified, but since it came into the posses sion of the English, it has been regularly fortified, though no guns are now mounted on the towers and bastions. The city is about seven miles in circumference, and has several gateways, named respectively the Cashmere, Delhi, Calcut ta, Lahore, Ajmere, Cabul and Turcoman gates ; the five first are the principal, the Calcutta and Lahore gates hav ing double roadways, one for ingress,.the other for egress, and it is hoped the same improvement may soon be made at the Cashmere gate, it being the thoroughfare to the canton ments. Delhi contains many good houses, mostly built of brick, amongst others is the Palace of the late Begum Sum roo, situated in the centre of an extensive garden near the Chandnee Chowk : it is now occupied by the Delhi Bank.* The principal street, called the Chandnee Chowk, is probably the finest in the East, it being about a mile in length aud 120 feet broad ; it is intersected by an aqueduct down the centre, and supplied with water from Ali Merdan Khan's canals It, as well as some of the other principal streets, is well drained, * In the mutiny this was nearly destroyed, when Beresford and his family were mur dered in 1857. t Since covered over and converted into a fine trottoir. tina note to Bernier's travels we read ' During the splendid era of Delhi the inhabi tants vtho resided at a distance trom the Jumna which skirted only one \"f i's angle*; experienced much difficulty in procuring river water, that of the wells not brim: esteemed so salubrious. Ali Murdan surveyed the land to the westward aud saw that a sluice opened from the Jumna where the river approaches Kurnal would from tlie declivity ofthe ground introduce water into the back part of the city and conduct it through all the quarters. The design was put into execution and Ali Murdan was allowed to levy a tax on the houses enjoying the uses of the canal in order to keep it in ,t pair. The canal did not tail into decay until the period of the Persian and A ITg han in vasions,"], [64, "3t Chandnee Chowk, Dareba FuTTEnrooRiE Musjid. swept, anil watered daily. When the garrison of Delhi were cantoned in Duryao-gunge, to the south ofthe Palace, the Chandnee Chowk was used as a mall by the European resi dents, but now only by the rich natives, many of whom take their airing in English carriages and buggies. The street leading from the Palace to the Delhi gate ofthe city is about five furlongs in length, and ninety feet broad, and was for merly second only to the Chandnee Chowk in importance ; but since the garrison has been cantoned at Rajpore, about two miles west of the city, it has declined.* The Darebah leadings from the Chandnee Chowk to the Jama Mus jid is narrow, but always presents a crowded and busy scene : many ofthe shops to the south end of it belong to lapidaries and gold and silver beaters. Further on, in the same direction, is the Khanum bazaar, where may be ob tained looking glasses, sandal wood boxes, Benares and Delhi toys. Near the Jama Musjid, in the street on the north, the shops are mostly those of the makers of cot-legs and wedding boxes, with two or three fire-work manufactur ers, confectioners' shops, and consequently flies abound in this quarter. The street leading from the Jama Musjid to the Ajmere gate is one of the best in the city. About the place where it branches off from the mosque, a great number of choory wallas, or bangle makers, have located themselves ; further west are the brass and iron merchants, their stores consisting of lotahs, towahs, and other vessels peculiarly, native, with bar, rod and sheet iron, screws, nails, Major Colvin writes that the canal shortly after entering on and skirting the base of the hills w st of Drliii ;tiie drainage of which crosses nyer the canal by ancient a js finally led directly across the ridge by a channel cut out in the rock to the d about 6a feet at the crest, it then enters the city and passing throngh it. by an open channel traverses along another extensive aqueduct into the palace, throughout, the whole of which it ramifies in open or covered water courses, having outlets on the Jumna thus permitting the passage of constant streams of fresh water. Similar to these in the space between the range of hills and the palace, numerous under ground channels were led off to che various residences of the nobles and the divisions of the city yielding to the whole city and its suburhs a supply ot (rood water from the open well shafts connected with these under ground water courses necessary to admit of their bein\" cleared uut. The above was written in 1833. The decay of the branches of the canal was gradual but inevitable from the distractions of the Empire. The occasional attempts at repair made in the intern als of political quiet were quite insufficient to meet the growing natur al difficulties, otherwise the lapse of a century would not have sufficed to obliterate all traces of general irrigation. \u2014 Editor. * The prosperity of these streets has much declined since the mutiny."], [65, "Lahore Gate of the City. 35 etc Further on is a market always well supplied with such vegetables as are in season and demand by the native popu lation. At the west end of the Chandnee Chowk, is a hrge and somewhat ruinous mosque, called the Futtehpoorie Musjid ; beyond it, towards the Lahore gate, on each side of the road, are the stores of the dealers in grain, and the shops of punsaries, or diUggists. Opposite the north gate of the Futtehpoorie Musjid is a gateway which leads to the, principal mart for European piece goods, and another bazaar of the same description is situated on the south side, and near the centre of the Chandnee Chowk.* The road from the palace towards the north west, leads over a bridge spanning the west Jumna canal, on the banks of which are numerous flour mills worked by the stream. Down a lane immediately to the left, is the mohulla occupied by paper makers ; further on is the old burying ground, crowded with tombs of all patterns and sizes. Immediately adjoining is the niao-azine, which contains a good armoury, and can fur nish fourteen thousand stand of arms.

Near the centre of the city, and about two furlongs from the Delhi gate of the palace, stands the Jama Musjid,*f or great mosque, which in size and beauty corresponds with tlie magnificence of Delhi in the time of its founder. It is built on a rocky eminence, called the Jujula Pahar, the sur face of which was levelled to form the site, which being higher than the surrounding houses, the mosque can be seen at a considerable distance on every side of the city. It has three entrances by handsome gateways of red sandstone, which are approached by magnificent flights of steps of the same material. The principal gateway is on the east side, and is much larger and handsomer than those on the north and south ; they all lead into a large quadrangle, paved with fine large sandstone flags, in the centre of which is a marble reservoir of water, in which the Mussulmans make the ablu tions required by their creed, before performing their devo tions. The necessary supply of water is drawn by a Persian wheel, turned by bullocks, from a deep well, cut at great ex pense, out of the solid rock in one corner of the building, and is thrown into the reservoir through a fountain pipe in the * Note to the Juma Musjid.

The front of the building is partly faced with white msirble, and along the cornice are ten -compart ments, each 4 feet long and 2_ feet broad, which are inlaid with black marble inscriptions in the Niski character, and are said to contain the whole of the Koran, but they really give an account of the expenditure, &c. in building the mosque. The interior is paved throughout with slabs of white marble, 3 feet long and li broad, each decorated with a black border, which gives it an extremely beautiful appearance. Part of the inner walls is also faced with plain white marble. Near the Kibla, or that part which indicates the direction of the city ot Mecca, is a handsome taq, or niche, adorned with a profusion of rich frieze work, and though joined in several phaces, appears to have been cut out of a solid block of white marble, four feet high and six in length. The Mosque is flanked by two minarets one hundred and thirty feet high, composed of white marble and red stone placed vertically in alternate stripe.s, and access is obtained to the top of them by nights of narrow steps of red stone in the interior ; at about equal distances there are three pro jecting\" galleries, and they are crowned with light pavilions of white marble. Three sides of the terrace on which this magnificent edifice stands, are enclosed by a colonnade of red sandstone, and each corner is ornamented by octagonal pavilions of white marble, the supporting columns being of red stone. In the quadrangle at the north east and south east angles, are low pillars, on the top of which are fixed marble slabs, on one of which is engraved the eastern hemisphere, on the other there are marked certain hour lines : each has an upright iron spike or gnomon, and the shadow shewn by the sun"], [68, "38 Beiouk the Mimm's, indicates to the Faithful the time of prayer.

On certain great Mahomedan festivals, the King used to go in state to the Mosque, and it was an interesting sight to view the whole of the quadrangle filled with Mussulmen dressed in their best and gayest attire, marshalled in straight lines, and ready to perform their devotions. When the chief Moul vees mounted the pulpit, the whole audience was hushed in a deep and impressive silence for a short time, the Moulvees then chanted the prayers and performed the genuflexions enjoined, in which the whole assembly joined as one man. On the flights of steps to the east and south sides of the building, a market used to be held every evening, where fowls, pigeons, singing birds, cotton cloths, chintzes of Man chester and native manufacture, pedlar's wares, smoking hot kubabs, bread, lithographed Oordoo and Persian books, sweetmeats, toys, and even old clothes were exposed for sale.

These heroes', with their brave mother, after a long and obstinate resis tance to the arms ofthe Emperor Akbar, being at length re duced to extremities, preferred perishing in sallies against the enemy, to submission to the invader. The religious preju dices of the Emperor Aurungzebe caused the removal of these sculptures, and in all probability their destruction, and at the same time he ordered the place where they stood to be enclosed by a screen of red sand stone, which strengthen ed, if it did not beautify the approaches to the palace. The entrance to the principal or Lahore gate is approached through a similar out work, or barbican. It consists of a large gothic arch, surmounted by a tower, ornamented with pavilions of red stone on the top.

In the wall, at the back, is a staircase that leads up to the throne, which is raised about 10 feet from the ground, and is covered by a canopy supported on four pillars of white marble, the whole being curiously inlaid with mosaic work. Behind the throne is a doorway by which the Emperor entered from fiis private apartment. The whole of the wall behind the throne is covered with mosaic paintings in precious stones of some of the most beautiful flowers, fruits, birds, and beasts of Hindoostan, most of them represented in a very natural manner. They were executed by Austin de Bordeaux, who, after defrauding several of the princes of Europe by means of false gems which he fabricated with great skill, sought re fuge at the Court of Shah Jehan, where he made his fortune, and was in high favor with the Enqjeror, as is shewn by his having been permitted to introduce his own picture in mosaic, playing upon the violin, amongst the other works on the wall. In front of the throne and slightly raised above the floor of the hall, is a large slab of white marble, which was formerly richly inlaid with mosaic work, but of which the traces only now remain.

It was surmounted by a canopy of gold, supported by twelve pillars, all richly emblazoned with costly gems, and a fringe of pearls orna mented the borders of the canopy.

The first sensation on viewing this immense block of stone is that of wonder, as to when, where, and how it could have been quarried, and next, by what means it was raised to its present position. Of the former but little is known, but fortunately we have an excellent translation by Captain H. Lewis, of the Bengal Artillery, of Shems-i-Seraj Ufeef's biograghy of the Emperor Feroze Shah, in which the author declares he was twelve years of age when the Lat was set up, and was therefore, in all probability, an eye-witness of some of the operations he describes as follows : \u2014 \"There were in the neighbourhood of Delhi, one near the village of Topurin the district of Salowrah and Khizrabad, and the other near Meerut, two very curious stone columns, which the king, after expending an enormous amount of treasure and labour, brought and set up, the one within the palace of Ferozabad, close to the Juma Musjid, calling it the Meenar-i- Jureen, and the other in his hunting palace (Koshuk Shikar). These columns were reported by Hindoo writers, to be the walking sticks or crooks of a Hindoo shepherd, by name Bheem, who used them in tending his flocks, and on his death the Hindoos are said to have placed them where they then stood for the purpose of worshipping them. Sultan Feeroz had gone towards Salowrah and Khizrabad, the latter being .nine ty kos from Delhi, and had alighted at the village of Tope rah, when his attention was first attracted to the column in that vicinity, aud he immediately made anangements to re move it. A number of men were collected for the purpose, both from within and without the Doab. A quantity of Semul cotton was first piled around the column, its founda tions were then loosened, and it was made to lean upon the cotton, which being gradually withdrawn from under it, in a few days it was laid flat upon the ground. On digging un der the spot where it stood, a large square stone was found, which was also removed. The column was then bound round"], [75, "Description of the lat. 45 with pieces of wood and the bark of trees. A carriage was next prepared with forty two wheels, upon which the pillar was placed with great labour and difficulty. A heavy rope being attached to each wheel and twenty two men told off\" to each rope, the carriage was made to progress to the bank of the Jumna wdiich was near Toperah. There a number of boats or rafts had been collected, some calculated to hold as many as 7,000 maunds ; upon these, the pillar was placed and floated down to the palace of Ferozabad, iu which a building was then commenced on which to *erect it. The au thor was at this time twelve years of age. The building consisted of several stories, and as each story was complete, the pillar was raised to the top of it. The whole being fi nished, arrangements were made for setting it up : strong ropes were fastened to the top of it, which were connected with some windlasses, the latter being made to revolve, it was gradually\" raised, blocks of wood and semul cotton being placed under it as it rose, to prevent it falling again. The square stone which had been found under it, was replaced in a similar position ; when erect, a strong scaffolding was con structed round the column, and the top of it was ornamented with black and wdiite stone work, surmounted by a gilt kulus made of copper. The total length of the column was thirty two guz, eight guz being sunk into the building, and twenty four above the surface. There were a number of curious characters upon the column, to decypher which, the king assembled a number of learned Bramins, but none of them were able to explain their meaning. Some however in terpreted the writing to signify, that no one would ever succeed in removing the pillar from the spot on which it originally stood, until a king should be bom by name Feroze Shah. The other column, which was brought from Meerut, in the Doab, was smaller than that just described. It was set up on the top of a bill, in the Koshuk Shikar which after this became a considerable town, a number of the no bles building their houses in it.

Thus Sultan Shums-un-deen Altumsh built a very high Meenar in the Juma Musjeed of old Delhi, as is known to every one. When Ameer Taimur came to Delhi from Khorasan, his attention was particularly attracted by those two columns, and he is said to have remarked, that he had not seen two such monuments in any ofthe countries he had traversed.\" The following is the traditionary account, generally adopt- by the natives, of the origin of the Lat. In the age of the El-kufoors, \u00bb there lived in the neighbourhood of Delhi a shepherd, byname Bheem Malahun, who was a giant among giants ; he was so strong that he could lift an elephant with his spear, and hurl him with ease from east to west, and his size was such that he required 80,000 pounds of food per diem to appease his appetite. He was employed in herding the cattle of his five brothers, and'the animals of those days being of gigantic size also, Bheem Malahun made two stone Lats, or walking sticks, with which to drive them. When Bheem departed this life for the infernal regions, he left his walking sticks behind him as memorials of his existence, and his people, the El-kufoors having held a long consultation regarding their disposal, it was resolved that the Lats should be set up, the one at Khirzabad and the other near Meerut. The Sultan Feroze Shah caused them both to be brought to Delhi, the largest being placed on the top of a building erected for the purpose in the palace at Ferozabad, and the smaller was set up in the Koshuk Shikar. i The second, or smaller Lat here mentioned, was thrown down and broken into several pieces by the explosion of a powder magazine. Five of these pieces were dug out of the ruins of an old baoli or well, and may be seen still there on the road side in front of the Maharaj Hindoo Rao's residence to the west of the city* ; the aggregate length ofthe remains of this minar is 29 feet S inches, and the diameter 2 feet 8\u00a3 inches. The pali inscriptions upon it are now nearly effaced, but they are said to have been exact duplicates of those ou the Minar"], [77, "Translation of inscription. 47 Zureen, as Feroze Shah's lat is sometimes called. It is not certain where the Koshuk Shikar stood, but there is reason to suppose that its site must have been on the hill where the Maharaj's house stands, near which is a subterraneous passage said to lead to the palace in the new city, out more probably it is the outlet of one of the subterraneous passages which branch off from the bottom of a treasure well in the Juma Musjid of Ferozabad. The following is a verbal translation of one of the inscrip tions on Feroze Shah's Lat. There are numerous historical proofs supported by the strongest evidence that there could not have been less than thirteen towns in the neighbourhood of the present Delhi. The historians of the Indo Mohamedan ages have placed many of them on record We find that Kootub-ood-deen Eibak the first permanent Maho medan conqueror, and his almost immediate successor Shums ood-deen Altumsh both inhabited the fort, wrested from Rajah Peethowra Feerthee Rnj from (1191 to 123) we find that Gheias ood-deen Bulbun (1266-1286) erected another fort and built an other town \" in which were magnificent buildings\" among them the celebrated Ruby or Red Palace ; this town it is conjectured must be the one so long designated in after ages, and when new cities had sprung up, as \" Old Delhi\", aud the site may be traced through the existence of Gheiaspoor near Hoomayoons tomb and the Deonpunnah fort. We find that Kaikobad his grandson (1286-88) fitted up a Palace at Kelokeree (Gunglookheree,* according to the Ayeen Akhberee) the site of which is clearly indicated by a remark in that work to the effect that Hooma ioon's tomb was within its limits, and this indication is confirm ed by the existence of a place of that name, a little beyond Gheiaspoor.

After this we leave Mubareekabad, built by the second Saiud, iu 1436, ou the banks of the Jumna, the site of which must have been most likely, either below Kelokheree, or above Ferozabad. We find that Hoomaioon, built (1533) according to A bul Fazl, (but repaired would probably be the more correct expression, as this will pro bably be found to have been the fort of \" old Delhi\" or \" Gheiaspoor\") the fort of Indraput, which he called \" Deenpuu nah,\" that on his expulsion by Sher Shah (Abul Fazl calls him merely Sher Khan, looking upon him in the light of an usurper,) that sovereign destroyed Secree, the town and fort built by Allah ood-deen, aud laid the foundations of another town (1542-1545) ; this the author ofthe Ayeen Akhheree tells us, was for the most part in ruins in his time, and will probably turn out to be tho town, of which the two extreme gates (N\". and S. nearly) are still in existence one (the Kabulee) near the Delhi gate of Shah jehanabad, and the other a very splendid edifice (the Muthra gate) near the western wall of Deenpuunah.

Of the two hundred towns built by Feroze Togluck many of which, in all probability, still exist in various parts of the coun try, under the several denominations of Feerozabad, Fecrozpoor, Feerozghur (aud possibly Feerozshuhur or Feerozshah, the name of which is immortalized by the oontest on the memorable 31st of December, 1845), probably the largest, and certainly the one deserving the greatest consideration, from the Arch\u00e6ologist, is the town of Feerozabod, of which some remains are still in existence close outside the Delhi and Toorkman gates of the modern city : aud of the reputed twenty Palaces are first, the celebrated one of which the vast ruins are still visible on the banks of the former stream of the Jumna, imme diately south of the extreme point of tho present town wall, and commonly known by the name of Feeroz Shah-ka- Kotlah ; and secondly, the Palace of Jehannamah, of which there are few remnants, one of them, however, most pro minent, in existence on the hill N. W. of the town of Dehli. Towards identifying the first of these two localities, (to the first of which, however, we must confine our present observa- i tions, leaving the account of the Jehannamah Palace for a future occasion,) as here laid down,* with the names they bear in con temporary aud more reoent histories, we have the following evi dence. In the first place it is stated in the Zuffernama of Alee Yezd, an almost contemporary author, whom we have had the good fortune to consult in the original, that Feerozabad was situate opposite the embouchure of the canal brought by Feeroz from the Kalee Nuddee into the Jumna, and that embouchure corres ponds exactly with that of the present Doab Canal which is, as near as possible, opposite the present ruins. In the second place it is stated, that Feerozabad was distant three miles from Delhi, aud three miles from Jehannamah, which, allowing that the site beyond Gheiaspoor was old Delhi, and that we have cor rectly identified the site of Jehannamah, corresponds as near as can be allowing an oriontal latitude for distances, with the pre sent position. In tho third place we have it recorded that Fee roz Shah brought a branch of his canal to Feerozabad, and there * With all due deference the high authority, under which the Revenue map ofthe district of Delhi made its appearance, that of Mr. H.

There is no actual village, and the Zumeendars ofthe lands that bear that name, live in the town of Delhi, but they pay rent under that name, and this circumstance most sa tisfactorily completes the chain of loc al evidence. It is rather singular that the only mention made of the town in Ferishta's history of the life of Feeroz Togluk, is that it was built in the year of the Hijra 755, corresponding with the year of our Lord 1354, or in the 3d year of that sovereign's reign, aud that it adjoined (comparatively speak ing) the city of Delhi, (the old city, tho Gheiaspoor above indicated 1) It is probable that up to that time, he occupied one of the Palaces in Delhi-proper, or at least during the periods of his residence at the capital, as it is stated that on the 2d of Rujub, A. H. 752, he entered Delhi, and there ascended the throne, and that his second son Mahomed, who ultimately suc ceeded him, was born in that town. This solitary allusion to Feerozabad, and the precise date of its foundation therein given are, however, of material consequence. We have in the Kalan Musjeed, the date of the completion of which has been accurate ly verified,* an excellent specimen of the architecture of those days, a fact of great importance, as the style of almost every mo narch, who had sufficient time to devote to the building of towns * Vide Asiatic Journal, as above quoted.

The materials, the plaster both within the walls and on the out side, the conformation of the domes, the slope of the entrance into the chief apartment, the battlements around the same, the stair cases, the brackets, the caves, and above all, the massive ness and geneial character, correspond so entirely, allowing for the difference of the edifices, one a Palace the other a Mosque that (here can be no mistake in ascribing both edifices to the same era, besides which the several buildings that elsewheie mark the site of Feerozabad, and which will be mentioned here after, all bear evident signs of having been erected about the same period as the Kalan Musjeed. Although Feerozabad is not again expressly mentioned by the historian we have quoted dur ing the life of its founder, it is reasonable to suppose, it continued a place of importance during his life and perhaps his place of ordinary residence. On the death of Feeroz in A. H. 790, (A. D. 1388,) Geias o'od-deen Togluk, his grandson (by the favorite and eldest, but deceased, son Jutteh Khan) is particularly stated to have ascend ed the throne in the Palace of Feerozabad, a fact which would go far to establish the correctness of the inference, that his own and of course favorite town was tho usual residence of Feeroz. Gheias-ood-deen was succeeded by a cousin named Aboo-Bukr. This prince was, after a short reiem of one year and six months, made prisoner, and superseded by his uncle Nusseer-ood-deen, who first took possession of the Palace of Juhannamah, Aboo Bukr being \" in the opposite quarter ofthe city called Feeroza bad\" (which supposing him to have been in the Palace of that town would be a correct expression with regard to the relative position ofthe royal residences of Juhannama and the Kotla, as Feerozabad appears to have stretched in a N. W. direction to wards the former. On the 18th of April 13S9, (2d Jumah-ool awul 789 A. H.) a battle took place in the very streets of Fee rozabad, in which 50,000 men were engaged under Nusseer-ood deen, a fact that speaks convincingly as to the great extent of ground it must have covered. It may also lead to the inference, that the town was very imperfectly protected by outer walls ; if they had been of any great strength or size, some trace of them would surely be visible, but there is not one stone upon the other, west of the Palace, that could be pronounced the debris of a wall likely to have been the town-wall of Feerozabad, Nus-"], [83, "Feerozabad in the time of Timour \u2014 site near Seeder 53 Jung's tomb. seer-ood-deen was defeated with the assistance of Bahadur Ka deer, a Mewatee chief, who seems to have held the scales in which several sovereigns are.vteighed, and found wanting if he did not side with them, lie came to the aid ot' Aboo Bukr, with a strong re-infor/cement. On the billowing day, the king in pos session, marched out of Feerozabad, anel drove Nusseer-ood-deen with great slaughter, quite out of Delhi. Another engagement soon after took place in Delhi, but which part it is difficult to ascertain from the context. After this engagement, Aboo Bukr, hearing of treason in his household, fled to his Mewatee friend, leaving Xussecr-ood doon, to take quiet possession of \" Delhi and its Palace.\" He shortly after piirsued the ex-King into Meerut there took him pijigfoner, and confined him in Meerut. It is ad ded that he died there some years after, but we may safely infer, that he obtained a conditional degree of liberty, as tradition as cribes to him, the excavation, which divides Meerut, at the pre sent day, into the black and white town.

Ten years after Taimoor's invasion we find Mahmood Togluk, still nominal king, defending himself in Feerozabad successfully against his ultimate successor Saiud Khizr Khan, in consequence ofthe enemy suffering from a scarcity of forage and grain. Three years after Khizr Khan returned to the assault, on which occasion Mahmood shut himself up in the old citadel of Secree, while Yekteear Khan, who commanded in Feerozabad, seeing the desperate condition ofthe king's affairs, joined Khizr Khan, and admitted him into the fort (Feerozabad), notwith standing which Mahmood made a successful defence of Secree.

From this time (1416) or G2 years after it was founded, it is most likely that Feerozabad began to decline. The building of Mobarikabad in 1435, showed that it was no longer thought a suitable residence for kings of another race, and while the construction, in 1533, by Humaioon of a new fort, and the foundation by Shere Shah, almost immediately af ter, of a new and distinct town, part of which must have been built on a portion of the site of Feerozabad, showed that as a town of any consequence it had almost enti\u00bbely disappeared, the materials being, as usual, in all probability, carried away to con struct more recent edifices.

Extract from Cunningliams Bhilsa Topps. 1. \" Immediately on his father's death Asoka seized the Go vernment, and gave orders for the slaughter of all his brothers, save Ti-.hva, Who was bom ofthe same mother. His eldest bro ther. Prince Sit ima, Who had marched against him from Taxila, was cut off by an an artifice ; and the Mauryan dynasty was thus reduced to the single family of Asoka ; who finding himself safe from the usual jealousies and Intrigue's of relatives, gave up his whole energies to the achievement of military glory*. In the short space of four years he succeeded ia reducing the whole of Northern India, from the mountains of Kashmir to the banks of Narbudda, aud from the mouth of the Indus to the Bay of Ben gal ; and India, perhaps for the first time, was brought under the control of one vigorous and consolidated government. 2. During the first three years of his reign, the mind of Asoka was fully occupied with views of worldly ambition and personal aggrandizement : but in the fourth year when all In dia was at peace, his restless activity found a more pleasing oc cupation, and a more lasting employment, in the acquisition of the Buddhist faith. Like his father Bindusara, he had been brought up as a worshipper of Agni and Surva, of Iudra Vavu ; and, like him, he showed his respect for the Brahmans by feed \u2014 ing sixty thousand of them daily. But Asoka was of a passion ate and impulsive temperament ; and when he became a convert to the Buddhist faith, he embraced it with all the fervid zeal"], [87, "Srr.EAD of BuDDnisM \u2014 Building zeal of Asoka 57 of his ardent nature and though like Alexander, he nthy once have wept that no more worlds were left for him to conquer he now found that he had still himself to subdue. The task, though difficult, seemed not impossible, and the royal convert, who had before been called Chand Asoka, or \"Asoka the furious,\" now submitted himself to the outward discipline ofthe Buddhist faith, and at last became so distinguished a followcr\"of Dharma, that he acquired the more honourable title of Dharm Asoka, or \" Asoka the virtuous.\" 3. The first proof which Asoka gave of his conversion to Buddhism was the dismissal of the sixty thousand Brahmins, in whose stead an equal number of Sramanus, or Buddhist ascetics, were daily fed. His next act was the distribution of the relics of Sakaya to all the Chief cities of India. These relics had been collected by Ajatastra, at the instance of Kasyapa, and were de posited together in one large stupa at Rajagriha. But the King had now determined to manifest his zeal for the faith of Buddha, by the erection of eighty four thousand Vihars, or monasteries, in honour ofthe eighty four thousand discourses of Buddha. As this precise number has always been deemed a fortunate one both by Brahmans aud Buddhists, it may be looked upon as the com mon expression for any very large number. These vihars aro said to have been erected in eighty four thousand different cities. I would reject the thousands and simply say eighty four cities and eighty four vihars. Building zeal of Asoka is fully confirmed by the Chinese pilgrim Hwan Thsang, who travelled through India in the middle of the 7th century of our era, at different places on his route, from Anderab, beyond the sources of the Kabul Ri ver to Conjeveram, in the south of India, aud from Pitoshillo, in the delta of the Indus, to Tamluk at the mouth of the Ganges, this pilgrim saw upwards of fifty large Topes, besides numerous Vihars, all of which were attributed to Asoka. This account agrees with the statements ofthe Mahawanso, which ascribe to Asoka the buildiug of splendid Chaityas on all the spots render ed memorable by the acts of Buddha. All these buildings were completed within three years. 4. This great King was not, however, content with the erec tion of stately buildings for the service of his religion, but, like a true Buddhist, while he sought the achievement of his own"], [88, "58 Edictson the rocks in cuttack gujrat, and Peshawdb salvation, lie wished for the eternal happiness of others. With this view he is said to have promulgated eighty four thousand royal edictst for the extension of Dharma. Numbers of these edicts engraved on massive rocks and on stone pillars still remain in different parts of India to attest tho general accuracy of the Buddhist annals. The oldest edicts are contained in the rock inscriptions, which have been found at Dhauli in Kuttack, at Girnar in Gujrat, and at Kapurdigiri near Peshawur. As these three places were the most distant points in Asoka's dominions, they were no doubt specially selected as the fittest positions for the inscription of these important rele gious ordinances. 8. Throughout all these edicts, both on the pillars and on the rocks, Priyadarsi announces his own adherence to Dharma (or the law of Buddha,) and his belief that the love of Dharma (Dhammakama) would continue to increase. He inculcates what consists in the strict observance of moral duties, in the per formance of pious acts, and in the entire subjection of tho pas sions and he declares that Dharma will be advanced by the pro hibition (ahinsa or avihinsa) against taking life, Dharma is in fact the only key by which the meaning of these inscriptions can bo unlocked '; and its frequent and emphatic use, through out these royal edicts, shows that their promulgator was a firm and zealous adherent of Dhamas, or the law of Buddha. Asoka was the same, for which reason the people called him Dhar masoka. 20. The ordinances of Asoka or Priyadarsi, were issued at different periods of his reign, Those of tho 10th and 12th years are found on the locks ofKapurdigivi, Girnar, and Dhauli ; while the pillar edicts are all dated in the 27th year of his reign. Much has boon written about the confused dates of the different pillar edicts, in spite of the clear and decisive language of the ordinances themselves ; which shows that they were all publish ed in the 27th year. It is true that the Eastern tablet refers to au edict ofthe 12th year, but this, as Priyadarsi states, had been abrogated, and the Eastern tablet, which mentions the abo lished ordinance, is itself dated in the 27th year. The words of the inscription referring to the edict of the 12th year are Pham-"], [89, "Ordinances and ni.r. \\r inscriptions. 59 malipi, likhapita, \"an ordinance on Dhai'ma was published,\" whereas each of the edicts ofthe 27th year is described as ivr.nn dhammalipi, this ordinance on Dharma.\" The ruck inscription at. Bhabra, near Jaypur, is ot' uncertain date ; but, as it mentions the third Synod, it must be posterior to 241 B. C. 21. The pillar inscriptions therefore contain the latest edicts published by Asoka, as they date nine years posterior to tho bly of the third Synod. The precepts inculcated in them are, however, generally the same as those ofthe 12th year, but a greater tenderness is < 1 for animal life, and a more compre- \u25a0 e view is taken ofthe moral duties of charity towards all mankind, and of the sacred duty of a king towards his subjects. This difference shows the advance made by Asoka in his acquire ment of the Buddhist faith, which is essentially one of good will aud toleration towards all men. 22. But the sincerity of Asoka's belief is further proved by the zealous earnestness with which he sought to propagate his new faith over all the distant provinces of his own empire, as well as in the neighbouring kingdoms of his allies. His own family had been early converted. His wife Asandhumitra was a zealous Buddhist; his Tishya took the vows of an ascetic ; his,gon Ku nala became celebrated for his early misfortunes and aster at tachment to the faith ; while his children Mahendra and \u00a7an<dia mitra who were initiated at twenty years of age, immortalized themselves by converting the people of Ceylon. Their mission formed part of the great scheme for the propagation of Buddhism which was arranged between Asoka and the principal Arhat, Mo galiputra at the meeting of the third Synod, in B. C. 241, in the 18th year after Asoka's inauguration. Major Kittoe thought it probable that these Lats wer cut from the sandstone rocks at or near Raj pur (Badshahrnahal) in the Sewalik, a few miles above the sunken city of Behat, and that they were floated down the river Jumna on rafts, to near the places where they were originally set up. Close to Feroze Shah's Lat stand the ruins of tho Jumma Musjid of Ferozabad, round tlie roof of which Feroze Shah caused the history of his reign to be written, but of this not"], [90, "60 Subterraneous chamber \u2014 observatory. a vestige remains, the entire roof having long since fallen in, and the debris removed from the quadrangle, in the centre of which is a treasure well, with chambers and subterraneous passages at the bottom. In the southern wall there is also a subterraneous passage leading to the vaulted chambers below, and having outlets on the banks of the Jumna. These vaults are the favorite resort of the seekers after hidden treasure. There are the remains of large buildings around, but none of them will repay the trouble of more than a cursory glance. THE JUNTER MUSTER, OR OBSERVATORY. The celebrated Observatory called the Junter Munter, stands about a mile and a half from the Ajmere gate of the city, on the road to the Kutub Lat. It was erected during the first years of the reign of Mahomed Shah, about one hundred and thirty years ago, by Rajah Jey Sing, of Amb here, the founder of the principality of Jeypore. Besides this observatory he caused four others of a similar description to be erected at Jeypore, Muttra, Benares, and Ougein, thereby evincing his great zeal for the science of astronomy, to which the Hindoos have always paid* particular attention. He also had calculated a set of astronomical tables, called in honor of the reigning Emperor, Zeej Mahomed Shassy. The only copy of this curious work is at the Jeypore Court, where it is preserved with great care, in consequence of a superstition, that its loss would be followed by the direst calamities to the reigning family. The preface to the tables contains an account of the instruments built under his directions, and assigns his reasons for building them on so large a scale, and of solid materials, in preference to portable instruments of wood and brass, viz. their greater durability, capability of more exact and permanent adjustment, and there being less chance of injury from accidents."], [91, "Equatorial dial.' 61 The largest of the buildings is an immense equatorial dial, named by the Rajah the Senirat Yunter, or the prince of dials, the dimensions of the gnomon being as follows : Lengthofhypothenu.se, ...ft. 118 r> \u201e \u201e base, 104 0 \u201e \u201e perpendicular, ... 5G 7\"\u00bb Both the gnomon and the graduated quadrants with the supporting pillars of the latter have been much injured : the edges of the gnomon were formerly of white marble, but not a single slab now remains, and it is only in some parts of the quadrants that the graduation of the hour lines can be distinguished. A flight of stone steps leads to the top of the gnomon, which is also pierced with several arched openings .to economize materials and labor. It is built of unhewn stone obtained from the low ridge of hills that lies to the west. The crown of the arch of the upper op'ening having fallen in, and the whole of the building being in a ruinous state, the Delhi Arch\u00e6ological Society obtained a grant of Company's Rupees 600 from the Bajah of Jeypore, but that sum merely enabled them to repair the great dial itself. At a short distance, nearly in front ofthe great dial, is another building in somewhat better preservation : it is also a sun dial, or rather several dials combined in one building. In the centre is a staircase leading to the top, and its side walls form o*nomons to concentric semicircles, having a certain inclination to the horizon, and they represent meridians removed by a certain angle from the meridian of the obser vatory. The outer walls form gnomons to graduated quad rants, one to the east and the other to the west. A wall connects the four gnomons, and on its northern face is describ ed a large graduated semicircle for taking the altitudes of the celestial bodies lying east or west. To the south of the great equatorial dial stand two circular buildings open at the top, aud each having a pillar in the"], [92, "Brahminical computation. 62 centre ; from the bottom ofthe pillar thirty horizontal radii of stone, gradually increasing in breadth as they recede from it, are built to the circular wall, each of these forms a sector of sis degrees, and the corresponding spaces between the radii being of the same dimensions make tip the circle of 360\u00b0. In the wall, at the spaces between the radii and recesses, on either side of which are square holes at convenient distances, to e'fiable the observer to climb to stieh height as was necessary to read off the observation, each ofthe recesses had two windows, or rather openings*, many of which have been since built up. On the edges of the recesses are marked the tangents ofthe degrees of the sun's altitude as shewn by the shadow ofthe pillar, and numbered from oue to forty five degrees. When the sun exceeds that'height the degrees are marked on the radii nymbered from the pillar in such a manner as to shew the complement of its altitude ; these degrees are subdivided into minutes, but the opposite spaces in the wall have no sub-divisions, being merely divided into six parts of one degree each ; the shadow of the sun falling* on either of these divisions shews the sun's azimuth, in like manner lunar and stellar altitudes and azimuths may be observed. These two buildings being exactly alike in all res pect, were doubtless* designed to correct errors by comparing the results of different observations obtained at the same in stant of time. MAUSOLEUM OF SUFDER JUNG. About five miles from the city, on the road to the Kootub, stands the beautiful tomb erected to the memory of Ubdool Mun Soor Khan Bahadoor Sufder Jung, who was Vizier of the Emperor of Delhi about 100 years ago, and was buried here in the year 17-30. The Mausoleum is si tuated in the centre of a garden three hundred and fifty yards square, and is surrounded by a stone wall, at the four corners of which are pavilions of red stone inclosed with ele-"], [93, "History of nuwab Sufdeu Juno. 63 gantly carved screens of open work. On three sides ofthe garden are spacious apartments for the accommodation of visitors; those on the south, named Mootee Mahal, are fitted up with the most indispensable articles -of European furni ture ; the others on the west and north, are seldom occupied except by natives; on the east is tlie entrance through a a lofty handsome gate way, above which is the residence of the petty raja who has charge of the whole. The general design of the Mausoleum is the same as that of the Taj at Agra, the apartments being the same in number and form but less in size. It stands on a terrace about twelve feet high, and the materials used in its construction are two kinds of sandstone and marble. Under the terrace is a vault containing a grave of plain earth, covered with a cloth, strewed daily with fresh flowers. In the centre of the first floor is a beautiful marble sarcophagus, elegantly carved and highly polished. The building is surmounted by a marble dome, and as a Mausoleum is a remarkable and majestic structure. It was erected by Nawab Shuja-ood Dowlah, son of Sufder Jung, at an outlay of three lacs of Rupees. The following is a brief outline of the rise of the Lucknow royal family to distinction. The founder of the present dynasty of Oude was Meer Mahomed Ameen, who was born at Nishapore, in the province of Khorassan. He was the lineal descendant of the Imaum Moussa Kasim, who was of the family of Ali, the highest and most noble in the kingdom of Persia. Dur ing the troubles which at that time overwhelmed Persia, many families of distinction emigrated to, and found an asy lum in Hindostan ; amongst these adventurers was Meer Mahomed Ameen, who, ambitious of distinguishing himself, repaired to Lahore, entered the Imperial service, and shortly after changed his name to Saadut Khan, under which he is better known. Having obtained the friendship of the prin cipal officers at Court, he was introduced to the notice of the Emperor Bahadoor Shah, who took him into favor, and, conferred on him offices of emolument and responsibility which he retained until the death of that Emperor. On"], [94, "64 HlSTOUfY NAWAB SUFDER JuNG CONTINUED. the accession of Mahomed Shah, Saadut Khan was created a noble of the Empire, and shortly after appointed Governor of Agra. In that important office he acquitted himself so much to the satisfaction of the Emperor, that he was nomi nated Soubhadar of the province of Oude, aud at the same time honored with a new patent of nobility under the titles of Boorhan-al-Moolk, pillar ofthe Empire, Himad-al-Dowla, confident support of the state, Meer Mahomed Ameer Khan Bahadoor Shoukut Jung (the glory of war) and appointed to the rank of 7,000 horse. Throughout the reign of Maho med Shah he was employed in the highest offices of state, aud is represented as having upheld the tottering fortunes of the falling Empire, but on the other hand, he is charged with having apprised the ferocious conqueror of Hindoostan, Nadir Shah, of the immense riches he might acquire by vi siting Delhi, and thereby induced the tyrant to take posses sion of the Capital, which resulted in the massacre of one hundred thousand of the hapless inhabitants ; but he did not reap the fruits of his perfidy, as he died shortly after of a cancer in his back, though other accounts represent him as having committed suicide by poison.

The most remarkable object in the vicinity of Delhi is the Kutub Lat, situated eleven miles from the Cashmere gate, near to the village of Mehrowlee. This extraordinary Pillar is unique of its kind, and stands alone in unrivalled majesty ; in height it exceeds the loftiest column in Europe : that of Antoninus at Rome being only one hundred and seventy two feet and a half, and the Monument of London two hundred and two feet from the pavement, while this lofty pillar tow ers to the great height of two hundred and forty two feet six inches, and there is every reason to believe it was origi nally built with seven stories, and that its height was then 300 feet ; the diameter at the base is 49 feet 3 inches, which gradually diminishes in fine proportion to the top, whose diameter is IS feet. The Kutub Minar having, by the dilapidations of time, earthquakes and lightning, fallen into a dangerous and ruinous state, the Government of India, in 1820, authorized its being properly repaired, which was effected by Major R. Smith, of the Engineers, at an outlay of i?222G. The following extracts from the Survey Report and the official correspondence on the subject, are interesting as shewing the state of the building before its restoration. \" The work executed on the Minar is no longer new. The nature of the repairs being intricate and unsafe* to attempt much of at once, has occupied a length of time, and as it was studied from the commencement to assimilate the repairs as much as possible with the old work, it is difficult to verify the repairs to the extent to which they have been executed. \" The leading features of the repair and new work, are a restoration of all defective parts, with a material correspond ing to the original, consisting of the dark red and light colored sandstones, the grey quartz stone, and of, white marble in their respective places. The great fissures and"], [96, "66 The Kutub minar continued. dangerously dilapidated parts of the lower story have been carefully rebuilt, and all the lost and aud detective parts of the numerous sculptured inscriptions perfectly restored. The like repair is effected through all the stories and their parts to the top of the old pillar, including in it the almost entire reconstruction of the spiral stair of the upper stories of the column whicb had fallen in a manner most dangerous to the stability of alt the upper part of the building. En tirely new balcony balustrades of red stone have been added to the four.lowest stories of the column, and a light iron and brass open rail added to the fifth story. The pavilion or sixth story newly composed throughout of red stone fluted columns supporting an enriched cornice covered with a dome and turrets ofthe same material, the whole being surmouted with an upper cupola octagonal top of sissoo-wood, support ing a flag staff. The former rude and fractured entrance door of the baso of the column repaired, and improved with new mouldings frieze, and repair of the inscription tablet. The external pavement at the west base of the pillar newly formed into a drain for taking off the water. \" The eastern angle of the ancient colonnaded enclosure called the Bhoot-khanah, which had fallen down opposite the entrance door of the column is rebuilt, and the whole area of the Bhoot-khanah and of all the ranges of ancient buildings near the pillar so throughly cleared out of the mud, buildings, rubbish and accumulated encumbrance of ages, as to hay the whole open to a free access, and along with this improvement, the field of ruin and encumbered ground at the foot of the column and all sides 1ms boon completely converted into open space, new and good roads of access, and communication with all parts of the neigh bourhood are established, and the vast quantity of incumbent rubbish has been collected into ornamental mounds aud seats of view in combination with the planting of about two thousand trees and shrubs which are thriving on all the adjoining grounds."], [97, "a ArrEAUANCE of the minar. 67 t; The whole ofthe above clearance and improvements to this public place of resort have, with the exception to the repairs of the column itself, been effected extra to and with out any surchage on the estimated expence for the restora tion of the Kootub Minar, \" The Governor General iu Council requests an expla nation ofthe following passage in the Survey Report: \u2014 \" The whole being surmounted with an upper cupola octago nal top of sissoo-wood supporting- a flag staff.\" His Lordship in Council cannot think that such a site has been well chosen for tlie erection of a flag staff, and the measure appears hlfogether to be an innovation, which, whether viewed as a matter of taste or with deference to the feelings of the Mahommedan Court and population of Delhi, has little to recommend it.\" Major Smith furnished the following explanation: \" I beg to explain that to surmount one dome with an other or upper cupola is a practice quite common in Hin doostanee buildings, an instance of which is exhibited near the Kootub Minar in the Mausoleum of Moonsoor Ali khan Sufdur Jung, Where there are no less than three domes in succession, the uppermost entirely for show ; and in regard to the flag staff, it is simply a short ornamental pole end to the cupola, not exceeding the length of the ordinary cullice, which is frequently in use as a termination to the Hindo dome. The flag is of the Hindoostanee or triangular form of the King of Delhi's pattern (red with a sun in its centre), aud has boon used on occasions of the KiuX visits or <>s any goiK-rii apsomb'age or m&la ::t the Kootub. The King has, after two deliberate visits at the Lat; conveyed to me tbroiigri the Commandant of the Pal ace Guards, his M-ajesty's satisfaction at tlie work as it stands completed. \"I beg now to advert to tlie e: fapi lafed and falling State of -the building before ii 1 on, and with reference to tli ting arid vague records, both iu"], [98, "68 Disapproval of the cupola dt the Governor General the published Asiatic Researches, and in the equally im precise oral tradition or other information obtained on the spot, as to the finish which the Lat of Kootub may have had. I had consequently, in restoring the edifice, one only guide, namely, the eccentric and diffusive character of the column itself as far as it existed, it is therefore possible that innovation (could the point be ascertained) is prevalent through a great portion of the restored pillar. \" Under this latitude of uncertainties I have endeavored to follow a middle course. I have neither adopted the veiy extraordinary superstructure in shape of a large' stone harp, which in the Asiatic Researches is stated to have crowned the top of the pillar, nor have I followed the plain square top ou four stone pillars, which some of the oldest inhabi tants about the Kootub state it to have been told them was on it. But more in accordance with the polygonal and cir cular style of the pillar, I have raised an octagonal stone pavilion over the restored column. To have entered into a highly finished ornament in termination of the cupola was not a part of the original undertaking, the very important object of which was, to secure the structure from falling to the ground, and I have from the first been unwilling to propose expense and splendor of ornament, which was not, I believe, originally contemplated, nor would it accord in mv view with the grave character of the surrounding ruins, and a wide field of desolation, to destroy the sombre ex terior of the Lat. \" The taste and notions of the Hindoostanees would de mand a gilt cupola and cullice over the whitewashed build ing, and if it be a permitted object to meet such prejudices, I take the liberty to suggest that a coppergilt cupola be authorized as the least objectionable finish with .reference to the surrounding objects, and is an improvement which would doubtless be viewed with delight by the Court and every class of Hindoostan.\""], [99, "Account of the cupola proposed to be erected. 69 Notwithstanding this explanation, the upper story of wood, with its flag staff and the stone pavilion, or (jth story, have been taken down, and the latter erected on a mound near the Minar, as shewn in the view of the Kootub from the east. It has long been a subject of dispute, whether the Kootub was erected by the Hindoos or the Mahomedans, and Colo nel Sleeman, in his \" Rambles of an Indian Official,\" thus endeavours to settle the question; \"A foolish notion has prevailed among some people, overfond of paradox, that this tower is in reality a, Hindoo building, and not, as commonly supposed, a Mahoinm edan one. Never was paradox sup ported upon more frail, I might say, absurd foundations. They are these: 1st, That there is only one Meenar, whereas there ought to have been two ; had the unfinished one been intended as the second, it would not have been, as it really is, larger than the first. 2ud, That other * Meenars seen in the present day either do not slope inward, from the base up, at all, or do not slope so much as this. I tried to trace the origin of this paradox, and I think I found it in a silly old Mooushee in the service of the Emperor. He told me that he believed it was built by a former Hindoo prince for his daughter, who wished to worship the rising sun, aud view the waters of the Jumna from the top of it every morning. \" There is no other Hindoo building in India at all like, or of the same kind as this ; the ribbons or belts of passages from the Koran are all in relief, and had they not been originally inserted as they are, the whole surface' of the building must have been cut down to throw them out in bold relief. The slope is the peculiar characteristic of all architecture of the Pythons, by whom the church to which this tower belongs was built. Nearly all the arches of the church are still standing iu a more or less perfect state, aud all correspond in design, proportion and execution to the tower. The ruins of the old Hindoo temples about the"], [100, "70 Sleemas's OPINION of the architecture. place, and about every other place in India, are totally different in all three ; here they are all exceedingly paltry aud insignificant, compared with the church and the tower, and it is evident, that it was the intention of the founder to make them appear so to future generations of the faith ful, for he has taken care to make his own great work sup port rather than destroy them, that they might for ever tend to enhance its grandeur. \" It is sufficiently clear that the unfinished Meenar was commenced first, upon too huge a scale, and with too small a diminution of the circumference from the base upwards. It is two-fifths larger than the finished tower in circumfer ence, and much more perpendicular. Finding these errors when they had got some thirty feet from the foundation, the founder, Shumsoodeen, began the work anew, aud had he lived a little longer, there is no doubt that he would have raised the second tower, in its pjroper place, upon the same scale as the one completed. His death was followed by several successive revolutions ; five sovereigns succeeded each other on the throne of Delhi in ten years. As usual on such occasions, works of peace were suspended, and suc ceeding sovereigns sought renown in military enterprizes rather than in building churches. This church was entire, with the exception of the second Meenar, when Tamerlane invaded India. He took back a model of it to Sainarcund, togethei with all the masons he could find at Delhi, and is said to have built a church opon the same plan at that place, before he set out for the invasion of Syria.\" The following is a translation of a paper in Oordoo read by Nawab Zeea-ood-deen Khan at a meeting of the Delhi Arch\u00e6ological Society : \"Be it known that the Menar of Kutub Sahib, which is now called in Hindee the Lat of Kutub Sahib, was built by Sultan Shemsul-deen Altainsli, who after the death of Kutub-ul-deen Eibuk, ascended the throne of Delhi in 007 Hijra, aud after a reign of 20 years died in 033.

Feiroz Sultan, with the assistance of God, repaired it.\" All these inscriptions have been written in the book Asar-ul-Sunadeedi, compiled by Syud Ah mud Khan, Moonsif of Delhi, moreover if it be necessary to have proofs from some trustworthy book, I refer the reader to the history of Feiroz Shah, compiled by Shemsseraj Afeef, which is a most accurate work. With great difficulty have I found the place where it is clearly shewn that the Minar was built by Sultan Altamsh. It is this, and will be found in the 4th chapter of the 9th book which treats of the second Minar. \"\u25a0 Every celebrated King has of course left behind him some Monument of his reism For instance, Sultan Shems-ul-deen Altamsh built the mao* nificent Minar in the Jama Musjid of Old Delhi, which is too well known to need description.\" And this Minar is in fact a Mazinah, a name which the Arabians give to the ])lace whereon the crier to prayer stands, as Abulfeda Ismael Jubee Hamvee, the writer of the Tareekh Makhtisir, in his book of Geography, which goes by the name of Takweem ul-baldan, and in which he treats of the Hindoo countries, calls this Minar a Mazinah, and mentions its form and the steps which lead to it in the. following passage : \"There is a Mazinah, in the Jama of Delhi like wdiich there is no Mazinah in the world. It is made of red stone and has 300 steps. It is not in the form of a square ; it has rather many sides, and is of great altitude. At the bottom the circum ference is great, and it is as high as the Minarah of Alexan dria.\" In the countries of Arabia and Persia near the Mosques Mazinahs are frequently made, from the top of which the criers cry to prayers. In Mekka and Medina there"], [103, "Theory concerning Hindoo origin of TnE Lat. 73 are five or six Mazinahs, and the reasons for 'constructing them are these : they increase the magnificence of the build ing, and they enable the voice of the crier to reach the ears of the people. From this latter reason great height is necessary. This Minarah is then unquestionably the Ma zinah of that Mosque, the foundation of which was laid by Kutub-ul-deen Eibuk.\" The foregoing would appear to bo conclusive, that the pillar was founded, if not entirely built, by Sultan Shems-ul-deen Altamsh, though it would have been more satisfactory had some explanation been given why it has been called after Kutub-ul-deen Eibuk. But ia addition to the arguments mentioned by Colonel Sleeman, as used by those who support the theory that the Lat owes its origin to the Hindoos, tbe following are also urged. 1st, That the Sultan-ul-deen Altamsh only ordered the comple tion of the building. 2nd, That if the Lat were intended as a Mazinah to the great Mosque, it would have been erected close to one end of, instead of being as it is, at some distance from it. 3rd, That the entrance door to the pillar faces the north, as the Hindoos always have it, whereas the Mahomedans invariably place it to the eastward, and an instance may be seen in the second Minar commenced by Sultan Allah-ood-deen, where the entrance door faces the east. 4th, That it is customary with the Hindoos to com mence such buildings without any platform, whereas the Mahomedans always erect their buildings upon a raised ter race or platform, as was the case when Sultan Allah-ood-deen attempted the erection of the second pillar, as may still be clearly* seen after the lapse of centuries, oth, That bells are used in the Hindoo worship, and throughout the ad joining Hindoo temple sculpture of bells hanging by chains form a prominent part of the ornaments of that building, and that on the lower compartment of the Lat the very same ornaments appjear more than once in belts or ribbons surrounding the pillar. That if the lower story were built by the Mahomedans, these symbols ofthe Hindoo religion would never have been introduced ; that the compartments"], [104, "74 The Mosque Kutub ul IsLA.it, Inscription. above the lower do not contain these sculptures of hanging bells, and that there is no appearance ol their having been taken from the Hindoo temple and inserted in their present position, ergo, the lower story at least is of Hindoo and not of Mussulman origin. A dispassionate consideration of the arguments here put forward, shews that the theory of a Hindoo origin is not such a \" foolish paradox\" as the gallant Colonel would have us believe, and it therefore remains an open question, whe ther this magnificent pillar, \" so grandly conceived, so beau tifully proportioned, so chastely embellished, and exquisitely finished,\" was commenced by the Hindoos or Mahomedans, though there is little doubt that the latter built the greater portion of it. The Mosque, of which the Kutub Lat is said to have been intended as one of the Minarets, was called the Mus jid Kutub-ul-Islam. It was built close to, and partly upon the ruins of an ancient Hindoo Temple called the Bhoot- Khanah and Pithoras Temple. Kutub-ul-deeri Eibuk des troyed the western wall of the Temple, and erected the Mosque Kutub-ul-Islam, to serve as the Jumma Musjid of old Delhi, in the midst of which it stood. The following; is a translation of the inscription on the eastern gateway : \" This Mosque was built by Kutub-ul-deen Eibuk. May God send his blessing on him who prays for a blessing on the head of the founder.

May God send his blessing on the head of him who prays for the welfare of the founder.\" The inscription on the arch of the northern gateway7 has been translated as follows : \" The construction of this build was commenced by the Great Sultan Moiz-ul-dunea-o-ul-deen Mahomed, son of Sam Nazir, Commander of the faithful, in 592, Hijra.\" To recoucile the apparent discrepancy in the above insciiptions, it must be borne in mind that Moiz-ul deen was the reigning monarch, and Kutub-ul-deen was only his deputy, therefore the latter may be looked upon as complimentory, for there can be no doubt that Kutub-ul deen built the Mosque. Shums-ul-deen Altamsh, his son-in law, when he succeeded Aram Shah, made Delhi his capital, and resided in the fort of Pithora, the ruins of whose walls can still be traced. He enlarged the building and increased its magnificence by the addition of the Kutub Meenar. His tomb stands on the north of the Mosque, and is now with out a dome, and tradition says that none was ever built over it. The tomb was erected by one of his sons, who succeeded him on the throne. The Sultan Allah-ul-deen also made some important additions, and was ambitious enough to commence a second Meenar, which was to have been as high again as the Kootub Lat. The following account is taken from a native historian : \" When by the aid of God the necessary repairs were made to the Musjids, with the view to keep them secure from accidents, like the Kaaba, he had a mind to build a Mazinah twice as large as that which stands unrivalled, and thereby confer honor on the dome of the hea vens. He first ordered the Musjid to be enlarged, in order that the Mosleem, who are so numerous that tiie world can scarce contain them, might have sufficient space for their devotions. And in order to make the Minar so high, that the top of the former Minar might only reach its middle, he ordered that the circumference ofthe new should be double that ofthe former.\" The following amusing extract is by another na-"], [106, "The Iron Pillar. 76 tive writer : \" The stone-cutters of Delhi, who in working sungkhwar far exceed Firhad (a sculptor), having taken their instruments, were planing sungkhwar so very smooth and beautiful, that if one were to think of it he would slide. The architects too, who thought Noman Nauzir of no skill in architecture, were placing stone upon stone in a most skilful and excellent way. The joinings of the stones fitted so, that not even a secret could be contained between them. The gates and the walls of the Mosque rose from the dust of cleansing to the clouds of purification. The year in which the building had proceeded as far as above related was Imaret (i. e. 711). The^ foundation of the life of a king should ba more endurable than the foundation of a pillar, so that the pillar of which the foundations have been laid might reach the heavens.\" The whole facing of the inner wall of the Mosque is co vered with beautiful designs of scroll work, and inscriptions in Arabic carved in the stone. All the archways were in a very ruinous state, but the largest, which is of majestic pro portions, has recently been restored by the orders of the Government, and has been well executed. It is to be hoped that the other arches may also be repaired, at any rate, to such extent as may* tend to preserve them from further dila pition, as otherwise, if left in their present state, a few more moonsoons will bring down these interesting monuments of past ages. Immediately in front of the largest archway is the cele brated Lohar ka Lat, or iron pillar, which is however a mis nomer, for it is of a compound metal resembling bronze, and of exactly the same form as the stone pillar at Erun, in Malwa, only it is not surmounted by the figure of Krishna, which the stone pillar has. The legend connected with it is as follows : The sovereign by whose orders it was cast, caused it to be put down through the earth until it rested upon the head of the* snake which supports the world, and the priests told him that his family should reign as long as * Lijh&y, or tbe luug of the snake tribe.\u2014 Ed."], [107, "The well at the Kootub \u2014 Extract from Fergusson. 7\" the pillar remained in that place. Prithi Raj caused tho pillar to be tak'en up to see if it really did rest upon the snake's head, when it was found that a portion of the blood and flesh of the snake adhered to the bottom of the pillar.

Tho remains of the un fortunate Shah Aulum, of Bahadoor Shah, son and succes sor of Aurungzebe, and of many others rest here. In the village of Mehrowlie, west of tlie Kootub, is a very deep well of considerable diameter. A certain class of the inhabitants obtain their living by jumping down this well for the amusement of- visitors, and are well satisfied if re warded by a donation of fun* annas. The leap appears a fearful one, but as the poti ntlred to it from al most childhood, they are perfectly unconcerned. NOTE TO THE RUINS OF THE KOOTUB, PROM FERGUSSON'S ARCHITECTURE. E3' far the most interesting group of ruins that exist in India, or perhaps in any part of the world, is that which is grouped round the tall column of victory ivhich Kootub erected at Delhi within the precints of the palace of the unfortunate Pirthay Ihvja to celebrate his conquest ofthe Hindus. Even in situation these ruins arc singularly beautiful, for they stand on the gentle slope of a hill overlooking a plain that once had been apparently a lake aud afterwards became the site of three successive capitals of the East. In front arc the ruins of Tuglukabad the gigantic fort of an old Pathaii chief; aud farther"], [108, "NoTB TO THE RUINS itc. 78 north the plain is still covered with ruins of old Delhi, the capi tal of the later Pathans aud earlier Moguls. Beyond that, at the distance of 9 or 10 milse, are seen the towers of Shabjehana bad, the modern capital, aud still the seat ofthe nominal monar chy of the great Mogul. Still farther north arc situated the civil station and contonments of the British rulers of the country. It is a fortunate circumstance that these were not placed here, at A\"ra, in the midst of the ruins, for it is to this we owe their pre servation. But for the distance it is probable that marble columns would have been taken for all purposes for which they ui'ht have been available, with a total disregard for the beauty and interest of the remains thereby annihilated. Even as it is the buildings belonging to the celebrated Shahlamar gardens, which were the only buildings of importance in the neighbourhood of the English station have disappeared ; but it is of slight impor tance as compared with the ruins to the south. All the pillars are the Hindu, aud all tlie walls of Mahometan architecture. It is by no means easy to determine whether the pillars now stand as originally arranged by the Hindus, or whether they have been taken down and rearranged by the conquerors. In this instance it seems most probable that the former was the oase, and that they were open colonades surrounding the palace of Pirthay Raja. But supposing this to be so with regard to the pillars, it is quite evident that all the enclosing walls were erected by the Moslems, all the' spring courses being covered with ornaments in their style, and all the openings possessing pointed arches, which the Hindus never used, if this is so, it is the only instance known of Hindu pillars being left undisturbed. The celebrated comtemporary mosque at Canouge is undouhted lv a Jaina temple, rearranged on a plan precisely similar to that of the mosque of Amrou at old Cairo but as the roof and domes are all of Jaina aichitecture, no trace of the Moorish style is to be seen internally : the exterior is as purely of Mahometan architecture. There is another mosque at Dhar, near Mandoo, of much more modern date, which is without doubt a Jaina temple rearranged. Another in the fort at Jaunpoi e, as well as fragments of other mosques elsewhere, all show the same system of taking down and rearranging the materials on a different plan. If there-"], [109, "Hindu patience in construction. 79 fore the pillars at Kootub are iu situ, it is the only instance known of such being the case. It may perhaps be necessary to explain that there could be no difficulty in taking down and rebuilding auy of these erections for the joints of the pillars are all fitted with the p-ecision that Hindu patience alone could give, and each compartment of the roof is composed of 9 stones 4 archi traves, 4 singular, and 1 central slab and all so exactly fitted and so little dependent on cement, as easily to be taken down and put up again. The same is true of the domes, all which being honestly and fairly fitted, would suffer no damage from the process of removal. The section of one half of the principal collonade (the one facing the great series of arches) will explain its form better than words can do. It is so purely Jaina that it should perhaps have been introduced in speaking of that style ; but as making apart of the earliest mosque in India I preferred introducing it in the place. The pillars used here are of the same order, and similar to those used on Mount Abu except that those at old Delhi are much richer and more elabo rate. They belong probably to the 9th or 10th certury and are among the few examples to be found in India that seem to be overloaded with ornament, there the ornament is so sharp and so beautifully executed, and the effect, in their present state of decay and ruin, so picturesque, that is very difficult to find fault with what is so beautiful. In some instances the figures that were on the shafts of the pillars have been cut off, as offensive to Mahometan strictness with regard to idolatrous images, but on the roof and less seen parts, the crossed legged figures of the Jaina saints, and other emblems of that religion, may still be detected. The glory ofthe mosque, however, is not in these Hindu re mains, but in the great range of arches on the eastern side, ex tending north and south for about 385 ft. and consisting of 3 greater and 8 smaller arches the central one being 22 ft. wide and 53 high ; the larger side arches 24 ft. 4 in, and about the same height as the central arch ; the smaller arches are about half these dimensions, and unfortunately are generally very much ruined. Behind this at the distance of 32 ft. are the"], [110, "80 Affghan notion of architecture. foundations of another wall ; but whether intended to be carried as high as that in front is by no means apparent. It seems probable that the Hindu pillars between the two screens were the only part that was proposed to be covered, some of them being built into the back part ofthe great arches and all above them is quite plain and smooth, without the least indication of any intention to construct a vault or roof of any sort. Besides this, a roof is by no means an essential part of a mosque ; a wall facing Mecca is all that is required, and frequently in India is all that is built, though sometimes an enclosure is added in front of it to protect the worshippers from interruption. Roofed collonades are of course not only convenient but ornamental ac companiments, yet far from being indispensable. The history of this mosque as told in its construction, is as curious as any thing about it, it seems the Afghan conquerors had a tolerably distinct idea that pointed arohes were the true form of architectural openings ; but being without science suffi cient to construct them, they left the Hindu architects and builders whom they employed to follow their own devices as to the mode by which this form was to be attained. The Hindus, however, up to this time had never built arches nor indeed did they for centuries afterwards. Accordingly thev pro ceeded to make the pointed openings on the same prin ciple upon which they built their domes. They carried them up in horizontal courses as far as they could, and then closed them by long slabs meeting at the top, the construction being in fact that of the a: eh of aqueduct tit Tusculum. The same architects were employed by their masters to ornament the facei of these arches, and\" did so by copying and repeat ing the ornaments ou the pillars aud friezes on the opposite sides of the court, covering the whole with a lace work of intricate and delicate cawing such as no mosque ever receiv ed befjre or since : au 1 though it is perhaps in a great mea sure thrown away aud lost when used on such a scale it is without a single exception the most erquisite specimen of its class known to exist anywhere.

This Fort was built by Rave Pithoura better known as Pirthee Raj the last of the Hindoo Kings of these parts. It is the strongest, though the smallest of the three lines of fortifications ofthe ancient city of Delhi, at present known as tlie Kootub or rather Mirowlee.* The line of fortifications to the West is in fair preservation, and shews how strong the place must have been in its palmy days.

The gate way is a double one built of solid stone slabs, the height now cannot from its ruined state be accurateiv given but by report it must have been 20 odd feet in altitude.* Just outside this gate are countless graves, and heaps of stones, shewing how immense the slaughter must have been ere the place was forced. The most celebrated grave is that of Haji Baba Rose Beh's in the ditch a little to the right, who it is said led the way and effected the capture of the place. Tradition relates that Shahb-oo deen Ghori was defeated six times in his attempt to storm the Fort and that on his returning to his mountain fortresses disap pointed and dejected, he met the \"Baba\" who advised him to try once more, to be less hurried, and to be more careful of the interests of the peasantry. The \"Babas\" advice to gradu ally subdue, and thus gain the country as he passed through, was apparently carried out, and it is said that ow ing to these arrangements, and the co-operation of the Raja Jai Chund of Kunouj which was again cheerfully given, this strong place fell. The Fort js currently stated to have been built in the year 1200 (*p Bikramajheet) and taken in 1232 of the same era. The Hindoos point with much complacency to the my riads of graves outside this gate when relating the valor of their ancient king, and exhibit the \" Kutwaria Serai\" or place of massacre, not far from the gate as famous for a most sanguinary and desperate struggle between Pirthce Raj's forces against the combined hordes of the Pa than invader and his ally. Fabulous is the computation of the loss of the enemy on that occasion, but equally incredible is the account of the numbers of the besieged slain in the taking of the Fort itself.

The story is that Shahb-oo-deen wishing one day to mock his captive or more probably to test whether his vision was completely gone, asked him if his well known accuracy of aim with the bow was impaired by his eyes having been put out. Raja Pirthee Raj said that he could even then hit any leaf on a tree that was marked out to him- -A bow and arrow was given him for that purpose, upon which he aimed at the direction from which he heard the King's voice, drew the bow and mortally wounded him in the throat. Another legend gives the reason of Shahb-oo-deen 's inva sion as arising from enmity between Jai Chund the Raja of Kunouj, and Pirthee Raj the Raja of Delhi or Indurpoor of those days. It appears Jai Chund once gave a \" Jug\" or grand feast, and invited thereto all the Rajas of the country amongst whom Pirthee Raj was invited \u2014 the Rajas \" Bhat\" dissuaded his master from going, saying that as his name signified he was the \" King of the Earth,\" he should not descend to pay court to any other Pontentate. Pirthee Raj assented to this advice and refused to go, upon which Jai Chund went so far as to offer him his daughter \" Sulooch na\" \u2014 a girl then celebrated for her beauty and who it ap pears Pirthee Raj had become enamoured of at some reli gious bathing place.- \u2014 Pirthee Raj was offended at tlie wording of the message and returned an answer that he could get her without such trouble on the part of her father, and subsequently carried the damsel off by stratagem. There are two other reasons given for the fall of the empire of Pirthee Raj, one is the Mussulman one Viz., that Kwaja Kootub-oo-deen (a Syud Fakeer the saint or \" peer\" of the Kootub, from whom it is called after, and at whose shrine a fair is held every year, \u2014 called the \" Churree-kee-mela \u2014 \") was persecuted to a great extent by Pirthee Raj whom he was driven to curse.

There was, at the time of his father's death, a saint at Delhi, named Nizamoodeen Ouleea, or the saint, who was supposed by supernatural means to have driven from Delhi, one night in a panic, a large army of Moguls under Turmachurn, who invaded India from Transoxiana, in 1303, and laid close siege to the city of Delhi, in which the Emporor Allaooddeen was shut up without troops to defend himself, his armies being engaged in southern India. It is very likely that he did strike this army with a panic by getting some of their leaders assassinated in one night. He was supposed to have the \" dust ol ffhyb,, or supernatural purse, as his private expenditure is said to have been more lavish even than that of the Emperor himself, while he bad no ostensible source of income whatever. The Emperor was either jealous of his influence and display, or suspected him of dark crimes, and threatened to humble him when he returned to Delhi. As he approached the city, the friends of the saint, knowing the resolute spirit of the Emperor, urged him to quit the capital, as he had been often heard to say, \" Let me but reach Delhi, and this proud priest shall be humbled !\" The only reply that tlie saint would ever deign to give from the time the imperial army left Bengal, till it was within one stage of the capital, was \" Delhi door ust.'' Delhi is still far off ! This is now become a proverb over the east, equivalent to our, \" there is many a slip between the cup and the lip.\" It is probable, that the saint had some understanding with the son iu his plans for tho murder of his father ; it is possible, that his numerous wandering disciples may in reality have been murderers and robbers ; and that he could at any time have procured through them the assassination of the Emper- or. The Mahomedan Thugs, or assassins of India, certainly looked upon him as one of the great founders of their system ; and used to make pilgrimages to his tomb as such ; and as he came originally from Persia, and is considered by his greatest admirers to have been in his youth a robber, it is not altogether impossible that he may have been originally one ofthe assassins or disciples of the \" old mt-n of the mountains s and that he"], [121, "Ancient Ruins. 91 may have set up the system of Thuggee in India, and derived a great portion of his income from it.

The reason of the assigned sanctity to this temple is owing to the religious belief by the Hindoos that it is sacred to the Goddess Kali (alias Kalka.) According to their religion it would appear that there formerly resided 2 demons on the line where the temple now stands, and that owing to their de predations a deputation waited on Brim (alias Brahma) and asked his assistance in extirpating them.

After his defeat by Aurungzebe, near Ajmere, he fled first to Guzerat, and afterwards towards Scinde, and placed himself under the protection of the chief of Jim, who treacherously made him and his son prisoners, and delivered them up to Aurungzebe.

This populai demonstration in favor of the rightful heir to the throne only accelerated his fate. A few days after a Council was held, and poor Dara was pronounced guilty, and worthy of death, as an apostate from Islamisn.

The Emperor Akhbar Humaioon, was the eldest son of the Emperor Baber, and succeeded him on the throne, shortly after which event he ceded to his younger brother, Kamran, the Punjab and the country on the Indus, in addition, to Cabul and Candahar, of which Kamran had been Governor during the life of Baber. Early in his reign, Humaioon after quelling the rebellion of two Afghan chiefs, and having brought to submission Shere Khan, his future rival, quar relled with Bahadur Shah, king of Goozerat, a monarch of formidable power, wdio had given offence by harbouring a brother-in-law of Humaioon' s, who had been engaged in plots against his life and government. Bahadur also gave protection to Alla-ood deen, uncle of Sultan Ibraheem Lodi, and enabled him to assemble a large army, which was sent against Agra, but was quickly defeated and dispersed by the more disciplined troops of Humaioon. The Emperor deter-"], [127, "Anecdotes and occurrences of his Reign. 97 mined on taking revenge upon Bahadur for these injuries, and marched from Agra to Mandesur, where the latter had strongly entrenched himself, relying on the superiority of his artillery, which was manned by Portuguese and commanded by a Turk from Constantinople. Humaioon so closely in vested the place, that famine would soon have reduced the garrison to surrender. Bahadur perceiving this fled to Maudu, leaving his army to its fate. It immediately dis persed. Humaioon went in pursuit of Bahadur, but ho managed to effect his escape first to Champaneer, thence to Cainbay, and at length found refuge at Diu, in the most remote part of the peninsula of Guzerat. Humaioon then proceeded to take possession of Guzerat, but the strong hill fort of Champaneer was not taken without difficulty and great personal danger to the Emperor, who with three hun dred chosen men scaled the almost perpendicular rock by means of steel spikes fixed into it ; this feat was performed during the night, while the attention of the besieged was distracted by an attack of the army on one of the gates of the fort. The treasure of Bahadur was concealed in this fortress, and the place known only to one officer, who refus ing to disclose the secret, it was proposed to extort it from him by toiture. but Humaioon advised them to have re course to wine, and gave orders that the ofliser should be well treated and invited to an entertainment given by one of his own chiefs. This had the desired effect, and when his heart was softened by kindness and good cheer, he told his entertainer that if the water were drawn off from a certain reservoir, the treasure would be found in a vault beneath it, and accordingly a large amount of treasure was found as he had described. After the taking of Champaneer, Humaioon returned to Agra, having received intelligence of the commencement of those troubles which ended in the successful revolt of Shere Khan, who had risen rapidly to power in the early part of Humaioon's reign, and was now engaged in the conquest of Bengal. Humaioon marched at the head of a powerful"], [128, "98 OCCURRENCUS OF HuMAIOON's REIGN. army from Agra to the fort of Chunar, which was strongly garrisoned by Shere Khan. After a siege of several months the garrison surrendered, and in order to disable the three hundred gunners, who had so ably defended the place, Humaioon ordered their right hands to be cut off. The Em- peror then marched towards Bengal, and near Patna was joined by Mahmood, the king of that province, who had just been defeated by Shere Khan. The latter not wishing to encounter the superior force of the Emperor, retired to Rohtas, with the treasure and stores obtained by bis recent capture of the City of Gour, and the Emperor took posses- sion of that place without further opposition ; but the rains had now set in, and it was impossible to carry on military operations in Bengal at that season. The inactivity, and the moist sultry climate, damped the ardour of the soldiers, many of whom died from the sickness that generally follows the heavy rains, and this induced many to desert as soon as the weather admitted of travelling. During this time Shere Khan had been very active in his operations, recovered Chunar and Benares, and posted his forces as far North as Canouj, so that Humaioon was cut off from cummunication with his Capital, and no other course was left but to en- deavour to force his way to Agra. Although from the fore- going causes his army was very much reduced, he was im- prudent enough to weaken it still more, by sending on a considerable force under Khan Khanan Lodi, one of Baber's principal generals, but by the time it had reached Monghyr, it was surprized and defeated by the troops of Shere Khan, who had now grown so confident, that he assumed the title of King, and prepared to intercept the retreat of Humaioon to Agra and succeeded so far, as to oblige him to pursue it along the opposite bank of the Ganges, and after following him about two months, succeeded in making a night attack, and surprized the Emperor's camp. Humaioon leapied on horseback and would have faced the enemy, but those around him strongly urged him to seek safety by flight : one of his officers seized the reins of his horse and forced him to the"], [129, "Vicissitudes of fortune. 99 river side, and as there was not a moment for deliberation, he plunged into the Ganges. His horse before reaching the opposite bank became exhausted, aud sunk into the stream, and the Emperor would have shared his fate but for a bhees tie who was crossing upon his inflated rmushuck, who sup ported the king to the bank. Humaioon then pursued his flight to Calpee, and from thence to. Agra, where his pre sence was much required, as pjjince Hindal was in open rebellion, and Kamran was marching from Cabul to profit by any opportunity of advancing his own interests. Prince Hindal being pardoned, the three brothers united in their exertions to arrest the progress of Shore Khan, who, content with retaining what he had acquired in Hindoostan, proce id ed to recover possession of Bengal. A few months after Humaioon again took the field and met Shere Khan. A general action ensued, in which Humaioon's army were en tirely defeated and driven into the Ganges. The Emperor was in greit peril : his horse was disabled, and he would have been captured or killed if he had not found an elephant ou which he mounted, but the moliout could not be persua ded to attempt to cross the Ganges, the Emperor was there fore obliged to throw him from his seat on the neck of the animal and to trust the guidance of the elephant to an eunuch : they succeeded iu reaching the opposite bank, \u2022which they found too steep for the elephant to ascend, and there appeared every chance of their still perishing, had not two soldiers tied their turbans together, by which the Em peror was enabled to reach the shore. His brothers Hindal and Askeri also escaped with some troops, and the whole party fled to Agra and Delhi, where they hastily collected the more portable part of the treasures, and escaped to Prince Kamran, at Lahore, who gave Humaioon but a cold reception, and not wishing to be involved in his quarrel with Shere Khan, lost no time in making his peace with him, by giving up the Punjab aud retiring to Cabul, leaving the unfortunate Humaioon to his own resources. His first attempt was to induce the province of Scinde to acknowledge"], [130, "100 Birth of Arbar the great. his authority, but this failed ; he then sought refuge at Joud. pore, but he found the Rnja mote disposed to deliver him up to his enemies than to afford him assistance, and was again obliged to seek for safety in the sandy deserts, where many of his followers died of thirst and fatigue. After the en- durance of many sufferings he reached Amercot, a fort in the desert not far from the Indus, with only seven mounted attendants, and here he found an asylum and was treated with respect and hospitality by the chief Rama Persaud. During this low ebb of the Emperor's fortunes, his wife gave birth to the great Akbar, a Prince who raised the Indian empire to its greatest lustre. Humaioon was too poor to make the customary presents on such an occasion, but he had one pod of musk, which he broke up and distributed among his followers, with a wish that his son's fame might be diffused throughout the world like the odour of that perfume. By the assistance of Rama Persaud and some other Hindoo Princes, a second attempt was made upon Scinde with no better success than the first, for being de serted by his Hindoo friends he was forced to proceed to wards Candahar, but before reaching that city he was in formed that Mirza Askar: was close at hand with the inten tion of making him a prisoner. He had only time to place the queen on his horse, leaving the infant Akbar to the compassion of his uncle, by whom he was treated with affection. Humaioon escaped to Garmsir, and from thence to Sistan. Here he was received with respect by the Governor, ami sent on to Herat, to await the orders of the King of Persia, Shah Tahmasp, who received Humaioon with every outward mark of hospitality and magnificence, but treated him with but little delicacy when he became in any way obnoxious to his pride or caprice, and forced him to be come a Sheea much against his will. Nevertheless he as sisted him with an army, with which he obtained many victories, but was at length defeated by his brother Kamran and deserted by his army, after which he suffered many hardships. Fortune favored Humaioon in a subsequent"], [131, "Virtues and character of Humaioon. 101 battle, and the city of Cabul was taken and all the open country restored to obedience. Kamran was betrayed by the Sultan of the Gokkars, and Humaioon ordered him to be blinded, which was performed by repeatedly piercing his eyes with a lancet. He bore this torture without a groan, but when lime juice and salt were squeezed into his eyes, he cried out, \" 0 Lord my God ! whatever sins 1 have com mitted have been amply punishecrin this world : have com passion on me in the next.\" Being now no longer danger ous, he was permitted to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca, where he shortly after died. The state of affairs in Hindoostan rendering it extremely favorable for an attempt to recover his throne, Humaioon set out from Cabul with fifteen thou sand horse, invaded the Punjab, took Lahore, and at Sirhind obtained a complete victory over Secunder Shah, who had advanced to meet him at the head of a large army. Huma ioon took possession of Agra, and entered Delhi in triumph, but did not long enjoy his recovered crown, for within six months of his return he met his death by an accident. He had been walking on the roof of his library, and was des cending the stairs on the outside of the building, but hearing the call to prayers from the minarets ofthe mosque, he sat down on the steps till the crier had done. Attempting to rise with the assistance of his staff, it slipped on the polished marble of the steps, and he fell headlong over the low para pet. He was taken up senseless, and was so severely in jured, that he expired four days after, in the forty ninth yerr of his age, and twenty sixth year of his reign, if we include the sixteen years of his exile. The high courage and virtues of Humaioon increase that interest in his sufferings which royalty in distress seldom fails to awaken in our sympathies. He was not only a patron of literature but a scholar himself In astrology, a science in great esteem in his age and coun try, he was more deeply skilled than any man in his empire. In the village to the north of Humaioon's Mausoleum is the tomb of the celebrated Mahomedan. saint Nizam-ood-"], [132, "102 The tomb of Nizamoodeen. dei n Oulea, to which pilgrimages are still made from all ptrts of India. It is a small but extremely beautiful build- ing of marble, surmounted by a graceful dome. It is kept very neat and clean, and a number of people are employed to read the Koran over his grave ; they are paid by contri- butions from the emperor aud the royal family. Three times r a mela or fair is* held at this place in honor of the saint. Close by is the tomb of the Prince Mirza Jeln who fell a victim to cherry brandy. It is enclosed by a beautiful richly carved marble screen. Here also lie the remains of the Emperor Mahomed Shah, with those of his mother, wife and daughter : it was during his reign that Nadir Shah invaded India, and the dreadful massacre of the inhabitants of Delhi took jjkco. Many other tombs lie around, and we must not omit to notice that of Jehanara Begum, the eldest daughter of Shah Jehan, which is deserv- ing of respect on account of the virtues of her whose, ashes it covers. She was celebrated throughout the east for her wit aud beauty, and her name will ever adorn the page of history as a bright example of filial attachment and heroic .sc-lfdiivotioii to the dictates of duty, more .especially when viewed in contrast with the behaviour of her sister Roxanara, who, by aiding the ambitious designs of Aurungzebe, enabled him to dethrone Shah Jehan. The amiable and accom plished Jehanara not only supported her aged father in his adversity, but voluntarily resigned her liberty and resided with him during his ten year's imprisonment in the fort of Agra. She did not long survive her father, and there are strong suspicions that she died by poison. Her tomb is of white maible, open at the top, and at the head is a tablet ofthe same, with a Persian inscription inlaid in black mar ble letters, to the following effect : *' Let no one scatter over my grave any thing but earth and verdure, for such best becomes the sepulchre of one who had a humble mind.\" On the margin is written, \"The perishable fakeer Jehanara Begum, daughter of Shah Jehan, aud the disciple of the Saints of Chusty, in the year of the Hejira 1094.\""], [133, "Extract from Hodson's life detailing the capture 103 of the ex king in September 1857. Turning from these last receptacles of royalty, the visitor is led to a Tank or Baolee, where divers are ready for a trifling reward to spring from the dome of a mosque which overlooks the water ; the leap appears much more perilous than that into the well in Mehrowlie near the Kootub, but the men are well inured to it from childhood, and the. writer has never heard of any accident occurring at either place. On the road back to Delhi is the Pathan Fortress, known as the Purana Kilia, or fort of old Delhi. The Royal gardens of Shalimar are situated about five miles west of Delhi. They were laid out by the Emperor Shah Jehan in the fourth year of his reign, and the sum of ten lacs of rupees is said to have been expended upon them. There were magnificent pavili ons, pleasure houses, baths, canals of water stocked with o-old and silver fish, and fountains with every other luxury to gratify the senses, render seclusion pleasant and beguile the tedium of life. The true account of the cavalry ' demonstration' is this : on the morning on whioh the city and palace were finally evacuated (19th), the whole ofthe available cavalry (not otherwise employ- ed) moved out through the suburbs in the direction of, though not on the road to, the Kootub; but with strict orders not to go under fire ? Well, we all marched out to the top of the hill on which stands the ' Eedgah,' and thence, from a safe and respectful distance, overlooked the camp of the Bareilly and Nusseerabad force, under ' General' Bukt Khan, quondam Subadar of artillery. While minutely examining the camp through my glass (I was with Brigadier Hope Grant, to show the way), I perceived by unmistakeablc signs that it was being evacuated. Shortly after a lond explosion showed that they were blowing up their ammu nition previous to a flight ; these signs were on the moment confirmed by the arrival of my ' Harkaras' (messengers), and I immediately got leave to go aud tell the General. I did so, galloping down along the front of the city to see if that was quite clear j then asked leave to go down through the camp, and see what was really the state of the case ; and Macdowell and I started with seven ty-five men, and rode at a gallop right round the city to the Delhi gate, clearing the roads of plunderers"], [134, "104 Capture of the ex king by Hodson*. and suspicious-looking objects as we went. We found the camp as I had been told, empty, and the Delhi gate open ; we were there at 11 a. M. at latest, and it was not until 2 p. m. that the order was given for the cavalry to move out, and they were so long about it, that when at sunset Macdowell and I were returing (bringing away three guns left by the enemy, and having made arrangements and collected camels for bringing in the empty tents, <fec), we met the advance-guard coming slowly forward in grand array ! We had been on to the jail and old fort, two or three miles beyond Delhi, and executed many a straggler. I brought in the mess plate of the 60th Native Infantry, their standards, drums, and other things. Macdowell and I had been for five hours inside the Delhi gate, hunting about, before a guard was sent to take charge of it. The next day I got permission, after much argument and entreaty, to go and bring in the ki:i2, for which (though nego tiations for his life had been entertained) no provision had been made and no steps taken, and his favourite wife also, and the young imp (her son) whom he had destined to suceeed him on the throne. This was successfully accomplished, at the expense of vast fatigue and no trifling risk. I then set to work to get hold of the villain princes. It was with the greatest difficulty that the General was persuaded to allow them to be interfered with, till even poor Nicholson roused himself to urge that the pursuit should be attempted. The General at length yielded a reluctant consent, adding 'but don't let me be bothered with them.' I assured him it was nothing but his own order which ' bothered' him with the king, as I would much rather have brought him into Delhi dead than living. Glad to have at length obtained even this consent, I prepared for my dangerous expedition. Macdowell accompanied me, aud taking one hun dred picked men, I started early for the tomb of the Emperor Humayoon, where the villains h:id taken sanctuary. I laid my plans so as to cut off access to the tomb or escape from it, and then seat in one of the inferior scions of the royal family (purchased for tho purpose by the promise of his life) and my one-eyed Moulvie Rujub Alee, to say that I had come to seize the Shahzadahs for punishment, and intended to do so, dead or"], [135, "Execution of the king's sons by Hodson. 105 alive. Aster two hours of wordy strife and very anxious sus pense, they appeared, and asked if their lives had been promised by the Government, to which I answered ' most certainly not, and sent them away from the tomb towards the city, under a guard. I then went with tho rest ofthe Sowars to the tomb, and found it crowded with, I should think, some 6000 or 7000 ot' the servants, hangers-on, and scum of the palace and city, taking refuge in the cloisters which lined the walls of the tomb. I s*w at a glance that there was nothing for it but determination and a bold front, so I demanded in a voice of authority* the instant surrender of their arms, etc. The}* immediately obeyed, with an alacrity I scarcely dared to hope for, and iu less than two hours they brought forth from innumerable hiding-places some 500 swords and more than that number of fire-arms, besides horses, bullocks, and coveied carts called * Ruths,' used by tho women and eunuchs of the palace. I then arranged the arms and animals in the centre, and left an armed guard with them, while I went to look after my prisoners, who, with their guard, had moved on towards Delhi. I came up just in time, as a large mob had collected, and were turning ou the guard. I rode in among them at a gallop, and in a few words I appealed to the crowd, saying that these were the butchers who had murdered and brutally used helpless women and children, and that the Government had now sent, their punishment , seizing a carbine from one of my men, I deliberately shot them one after another. I then ordered the bodies to be taken into the city, and thrown out on the ' Chiboutra,' in front of the Kotwali,* where the blood of their innocent victims still could be distinctly traced. The bodies remained before the Kotwalie until this morning, when, for sanitary reasons, they were removed. In twenty-four hours, therefore, I disposed ofthe principal mem bers of the house of Timur the Tartar. I am not cruel, but I confess I did rejoice at the opportunity of ridding the earth of these wretches.

I am allowed to insert hero a most graphic letter, written by Lieut. Macdowell, 2nd in command of Hodson's Horse : \u2014 'On the morning of the 19th September 1857 we formed up ' and saw the townspeople coming in thousands out of the Delhi ' gate (still in the enemy's possession), and passing through their ' camp, taking the high road to the Kootub. Too far off to do ' any damage, we waited (the ground a mass of hard rocks, ' impracticable for cavalry) till 9 a.m., and then retired. Hodson, ' ray commanding officer, then went to the General, and at ten I ' received a note from him, \" Gallop down with fifty men and ' meet me at the Cashmere gate as sharp as possible.\" Down I ' went, and he told me he had volunteered to ride through the ' enemy's camp and reconnoitre ; that no one knew if they were ' there in force or not, and he asked me if I would accompany ' him. Of course I was only too glad, and off we went. They ' fired at us as we approached, from gardens and places all round, ' but I imagine they thought more men were coming and bolted, ' we (only fifty of us) cutting upall their stragglers .to the tune of ' some fifty or sixty. As we came back we intercepted a whole ' lot of townspeople escaping. Well, I must not linger on this ' Having done our work (and it wasn't a bad thing to do to gallop ' through their camp with fifty men, not knowing whether they ' were there or not), we cautiously approached the Delhi gate. It ' was open, but all was silent. Our troops had not as yet ven ' tured so far. Afar off we heard the firing in the city in other ' quarters; leaving our men outside, with four Sowars behind us ' with cocked carbines, we rode in, holding our revolvers ready ' for ;t row. Not a soul was there ; all still as death. I looked ' round, and close to where I was sitting were two bottles of ' beer amidst a heap of plate, silver, clothes, <fcc. Perhaps I didn't 'jump off sharp ! It was all right; real beer! madam; we ' uncorked, and drank the Queen's health at once. After a little ' time, as the firing approached, and we found all was right, we ' rode away, aud reported what we had done. The General was ' very pleased. ' And now for my great adventure. On the 20th the King ' gave himself up, and was lodged securely in Delhi under a ' guard. Un this day all had evacuated tho place, of which we"], [137, "Macdowelt/s account. 107 'were complete masters. On the 21st a note from Hod- \u00abson, \"Come sharp, bring one hundred men.\" Off I went, time ' 6 o'clock a. m. To explain why ho wrote to me, I must tell ' you that although he commanded the regiment, he was also tho ' head of the Intelligence Department, and lived in the General's ' quarters, while I lived with the regiment, commanding it in his ' al iscncc, as being Second in command. Well, down I went. ' He told me he had heard that the three Princes* (the heads of ' the rebellion and sons of the King) were in a tomb six miles off, ' and he intended going to bring them, and offered me the ' chance of accompanying him. Wasn't it handsome on his part ! ' Of course I went : we started at about eight o'clock, and pio- ' ceeded slowly towards the tomb. It is called Humayoon's ' Tomb, and is an immense building. In it were the princes and 'about 3000 Mussulman followers. In the suburb close by ' about 3000 more, all armed, so it was rather a ticklish bit of ' work. We halted half a mile from the place, and sent in to ' say the princes must give themselves up unconditionally, or ' take the consequences. A long half honr elapsed, when a ' messenger came out to say the princes wished to know if their ' lives would be promised them, if they came out. \" Uncondi- ' tional surrender,\" was the answer. Again we waited. It was ' a most anxious time. We dared not take them by force, or all ' would have been lost, and we doubted their coming. We heard ' the shouts of the fanatics (as we found out afterwards) begging ' the princes to lead them on against us. And we had only one ' himdred men, and were six miles from Delhi. At length, I sup- ' pose, imagining that sooner or later they must be taken, they ' resolved to give themselves up unconditionally, fancying, I ' suppose, as we had spared the King, we would spare them. So ' the messenger was sent to say they were coming. We sent ten ' men to meet them, and by Hodson's order I drew the troop up ' across the road, ready to receive them, and shoot them at once ' if there was any attempt at a rescue. Soon they appeared in a ' small \" lluth\" or Hindoostanee cart drawn by bullocks, five ' troopers ou each side. Behind them thronged about 2000 or ' 3000 (I am not exaggerating) Mussulmans.

Every body says it is the most dashing 'and daring thing that has been done for years (not on my part, 'for I merely obeyed orders, but on Hodson's, who planned and ' carried it out ) Well, I must finish my story. We came up ' to the princes, now about five miles from where we had taken ' them, aud close to Delhi.

Their ' names were Mirza Mogul, the king's nephew and head of the ' whole business ; Mirza Kishcre Sultamet, who was also one of i the principal rebels, and had made himself notorious by rimr i dering women and children ; and Abu Bukt, the commander-in \u00ab chief nominally, and heir-apparent to the throne.

Tiiti Egyptians and Phenicians, the most ancient navigators mentioned in history, are represented as the first people of the west who opened a communication by sea with India,* and Herodotus is the earliest historian who gives any account of this country ; but he seems to have been acquainted only with the western parts, which were tributary to Persia. The aversion of the Indians themselves to disclose the annals of their history, which are interspersed with their religious .tenets, has involved their transactions, in ancient times, in impenetrable darkness, and the only light to conduce us through the obscure paths of their antiquities, we derive from an historical poem, translated into the Persian language in the reign of Acbar.t After the Babylonish monarchy, of which India is supposed to have foimed a portion, was subdued by Persia, Darius Hystaspes the king of Persia, conquered the western part of Hindostan, about- the year 500* before the Christian era. The expedi tion of Alexander the Great, 327 years before Christ, increased the scanty knowledge which Europeans had hitherto possessed concerning India, although his military operations extended only to the modern province of Lahore and the countries on the banks of the Indus from Mooltan to the sea. On the death of Alexander, the eastern part of his dominions devolved first on Pytho, and afterwards on Seleucus, the founder of the Syrian empire.

He advanced much beyond the boundary of Alexander's progress in India, but stop ped in his career in order to oppose Autigouus who was preparing to invade his dominions. Seleucus concluded a treaty with San dracottus; iu consequence of which that monarch retained the kingdom he hai acquired. But tbe possessions of the Macedonians seem to have remii ied unimpaired daring the reign of Seleucus. No historian ha; fixed the time or described the manner, in which the territories of the Syrian monarchs in India were wrested from them. It is probable they wore obliged to abandon that country ;:oon after the death of Seleucus. But the Greeks in a smaller kingdom, composed of some fragments of Alexander's empire, still maintained an intercourse with India, and even made some considerable acquisition of ter ritory there. This was the kingdom of Bactria, originally subject to Seleucus, hut wrested from his son or grandson and rendered an independent state about sixty -nine years after the death of Alexander. It seems that its commerce with India was great, and that the conquests of the Bactri-m kings in that country were more extensive than those of Alexander. \"We are informed by the historians of China, that about 126 years before the CnristAan era, a horde of Tartars, pushed from their native seats on the confines of China, and obliged to move toward the west by the pressure of a more numerous body that rolled on behind them, poured iu upon Bactria, overwhelmed that kingdom, and pat an end to the dominion of the Greeks there, after it had been established near 130 years.

The history of Hindostan is involved in much obscurity until the invasion of that country by the Mahommedans, in the year 1000. This invasion was conducted by Mahmud, Emperor of Ghizni,* who had made a vow that if ever he should be blessed with tranquil lity in his own dominions, he would turn his arms against the idolaters of Hindostan! He was opposed by Jeipal, the Indian prince of Lahore, and an obstinate battle ensued, in which the emperor was victorious. Jeipal was taken prisoner, and round his n feck were found sixteen strings of jewels, each of which was valued at 180,000 rupees, (altogether about 320,000/. of money). In the year 1008, Mahmud marched against the Hindoos of Kagracot, destroying their temples. There was in Nagracot a fort called Bime, where the Hindoos had deposited the wealth consecrated to their idols in all the neighbouring kingdoms ; so that the Emperor, when he took this found in it seven \"hundred thousand golden dinars, seven hundred maunds* of gold aud silver plate, fort) maunds of pure gold in ingots, two thousand maunds of silver bullion, aud twenty maunds of various jewels set. Mahmud retired with this immense treasure to Ghizni ; but returned to Hindostan in 1011, and during this second invasion Tannasar, a place held in the same veneration by the Hindoos as Mecca by tbe Musulmans, was destroyed, and Delhi taken. After a lapse of seven years Kinnoge was reduced, and the city of Muttra, or Matura, soon shared the same fate. He intended to destroy the temples, but found that the labour exceeded bit capacity. Some say that he was turned from his purpose by the admirable beauty of those edifices. It is said that Mahmud found in Muttra five great idols of pure gold, with eyes of rubies, each of which eyes was worth 50,000 dinars. * The Empire of Ghizni was founded iu the year of our era g6i) by Ahistagi. governor ofChorassan. A bistagi revolted from the King of Bucharia. whose ancestor, in his turn, ha 1 arisen to power on the ruins of the Oaliphat empire, about eighty. seven years hefore. Ghizni consisted chiefly of the tract which composed the kingdom of Bactria, after the division of Alexander's empire : that is. the countries lying between Parthia und tie Indus and south of the Oxus.

Upon another idol he found a sapphire, weighing four hundred miskals ; and the image being melted, produced 98,300 miskals of pure gold. Besides these, there were above a hundred idols of silver, which loaded a hundred camels with bullion. In the year 102-1, Mahmud conquered the province of Guzerat, demo lishing the temple of Sumnat ; which contained a greater quan tity of jewels and gold than, ;t is thought, any* royal treasury ever contained before. Mahmud died in 102S, master of the eastern and by much the largest part, of Persia and nominally of the Indian provinces, from the western part of the Ganges to the peninsula of Guze rat ; and also of the provinces between the Indus and the moun tains of Agimere. It is worthy of remark that during these in vasions the rajputs of Agimere preserved their independence, which indeed they have not altogether lost even at this day. Under a succession of warlike princes, tbe empire of Ghizni (or Gazna) rose to a surprising magnitude. In the reign of Musa ood I., son of Mahmud, it extended from Ispahan to Bengal, and from the mouths of the Iudus to the Hanks of the Jaxartes, which comprehends nearly one-half of the great continent of Asia. But in the' year 1153 the Ghiznian empire was broken. Tho family of Gauridaso, from the province of Gaui' beyond the In dian Caucasus, became possessed of the western and most consi derable part. The parts contiguous to both sides of the Indus continued in the possession of Chnsero or Cusroe, who fixed his residence at Lahore. In 1181, however, tbe Gaurides expellee! the successors of Chusero from their dominions. In 1194, Mu hammed Ghori invaded Hindostan, carried his arms as far as Benares\"*, and conquered the eastern part of Agimere and the country to the river Jumna, including the fortress of Gualior.t After the death of this emperor, in 1205, the Ghiznian em pire was again divided. The unambitious character of the sur- * Muhamme-1 Ohero perpetrated in the city of Benares the same crimes as Mahmud had before done at N'agracot ami Sumnat. Benares was regarded as tbe principal mo ver ity us Brahminical learning ; and'wemay conclude (observes Major Rennell' that about this perind. the Shanscrit language, which was before the current language of Hindustan, began to decline in its purity, by the adm-xture of words from that ofthe conqueror ; until the language of Hindostan became what it now is : the original Shanscrit, preserved in their ancient writings becoming a dead language. + The fortress of Gnalior then gave name to a kingdom which since has composed nearly the Suubah of Agra"], [149, "119 APPENDIX. Tilting princes of the family of Chore gave au opportunity to two of the imperial slaves to divide the empire which Muhammed had been at much pains to acquire. Eldoze retained possession of the Persian part, and Cuttub was already viceroy of the empire over the conquests in India. It was from Cuttub the Mahommedan empire of the Patans or Afghans in India commenced, and Delhi became the capital city. The Afghans originally inhabited the mountainous country between India and Persia. In 1210 the emperor Altumsh, who succeeded Cuttub to tho Patan throne, completed the conquest of nearly the whole of Hindostan Proper. * He was the first Mahommedan who conquered Bengal. During his reign Jenghiz Khan achieved the conquest of the other branch ofthe Ghizuian empire; but Hindostan was not molested at that time. In 1242, the Moguls, successors of Jenghiz, plundered the provinces on the banks of the five branches of the Indus, and returned to Ghizni. The situation of the country was not very dissimilar from what it had been before the invasion of the Mahommedans : it included a great number of states tributary to the emperor, but scarcely to be considered as forming part of the same empire. Eevolts were therefore very frequent. The kingdoms of Guzerat and ilalava, which had been annexed to the empire by Cuttub, were permitted to shake off the yoke in 1165. The rajputs likewise were constantly asserting their freedom ; and dreadful massacres, rebellion and barbarous conquests make up the history of Hindos tan almost to the period when the government fell into the hands ofthe English. While the kings of Delhi were prosecuting their conquests in the east and south of Hindostan, the provinces on the west of the ( Indus were neglected, though not avowedly relinquished. * Hindostan has by the people of modern Europe been understood to mean the tract situated between the rivers Ganges and Indus, on the east and west ; the Thibetinn and Tartarian mountains on the north; and the sea on the south. But strictly speaking, the extent of Hindostan is much more circumscribed, and the rame ought to be applied only to that part ofthe above tract, which lies to the north of the parallels of 21\" or 22\u00b0. The Nirbidda river is, indeed, the reputed southern boundary of Hindustan as far as it goes -. and the southern frontiers or Bengal and Bahar compose the remainder of it. The countries on the south of this line go under the general name of Deccan, and comprise nearly one-half of the tract generally known by the name of the Mol-uI Empire. But as the term Hindostan has been applied in a lax sense to this whole region, it may be 11 e ces-ary to distinguish the northern part of it by the name of Hindostan proper Ibis tract, lias indeed the Indus and the mountains of Thibet, and tartary for its western and northern boundaries ; but the Ganges was improperly applied us an eastern boundary as it intersect, in its course some of tut richest provinces of the en)pije.-Be\u00bbne\u00ab."], [150, "120 APPBNDI***. It might have been expected, observes Major ReirneH, that 30 excellent a barrier as the upper part of the Indus and the deserts beyond Agimere would have induced an emperor of Hindostan to give up, of choice, all the provinces that lay ou the west of this line ; and the neglect of so prudent a conduct occasioned the peace of the empire to be often disturbed, and ended in their being forcibly taken away at last by the Moguls ; who, not contented with their new acquisitions on the west of the Indus, crossed that river and invaded the Punjab ; and so formidable did they appear to Ferose II. that some tribes of them were permitted to settle in that country in the year 1292. In 1293, this emperor determined to iuvade the Deccan.* The riches of Ramdeo, king of Deogire (now Dowlatabad), one of the principalities of the Deccan, gave birth to this project ; and the projector was Alia, Ferose's nephew, governor of Kurrah, \u25a0which nearly bordered on the devoted countn*. Alia marched against Ramdeo, who possessed the wealth of a long line of kings, and having taken Deogire, he concluded st treaty of peace with that prince upon the following almost incredible terms ; that in consideration of evacuating the country Alia should receive six hundred maunds of pure gold/' seven maunds of pearls, two maunds of diamonds, rubies, eme ralds and sapphires, one thousand maunds of silver, four thou sand pieces of silk, and a long list of other precious commodities surpassing all belief. Alia had thus the means of increasing the number of his adherents, and having murdered the emperor, his uncle, ha assumed to himself the sovereignty of Hindostan. During his reign the Moguls frequently invaded the empire, but were repulsed with great slaughter. Alia snbdued Guzerat, the Deccan, and * The Deccan at that time included all the territory lying to the south of the Nir bidda and Mahanada (or Cattack) rivers . au extent of dominion almost equal to all that Ferose already possessed in Hindustan ; and which exiended from the shores of the Indus, to the mouth of the Ganges; and from the northern mountains, to Cattack, Sirong and Agimere : the greatest part of Mulava, with Guzerat and Sindi, being then independent.

Many thousand Moguls, whom he took prisoners, were trodden to death by elephants ; and the Mogul mercenaries in his army having incurred his displeasure, he ordered them to be all dis charged. The greater number1 remained at Delhi in great distress, and some among them entered into a conspiracy to murder .the king. This plot being discovered, Alia, instead of punishing the conspirators, extended his inhuman rigour to the whole body. He ordered them all to be instantly put to the sword ; so that fifteen thousand of those unhappy wretches lay dead in the streets of Delhi in one day. In 1316 Alia died. He was succeeded by some of his children, whose reigns, however, were short. The vengeance of heaven overtook' and' exterminated the race of that usurper, for his in gratitude to his uncle Ferose, and the streams of innocent blood which flowed from his hands. In the commencement of the reign of Muhammed III. who ascended the throne in 1325, the Moguls invaded Hindostan. Having subdued Limghan, Mooltan and the northern provinces, they advanced towards Delhi. Muhammed sued for peace ; he sent an immense present in gold and jewels to soften the Mogul chief, who at last consented, upon receiving almost the price of the empire, to return to his own country, taking Guzerat and Sind in his way, which he plundered of a world of wealth. Muhammed formed a resolution to subdue China, and a pro digious army was marched into that country ; but the troops were struck with dismay upon seeing a formidable army prepar ed to oppose them, and scarcely a man came back to relate the particulars of their defeat.

The empire of Persia continued under petty princes till Ti mour Bee, commonly called Tamerlane, mounted the throne ofthe kingdoms of Zagatay, which comprehended all Maver-ul-Nere or Transoxiana, and the provinces of Cabul, Zabulistan and others toward the Indus. After the conquest of the northern Tartary, he turned his arms against Persia, and entered Chorassan, seven years before the death of Ferose, the Patan emperor of Hindostan. He completed the conquest of Persia in less than five years, and when Ferose died, Timour was employed iu the reduction of the provinces on the Euphrates. In the year 1398, Timour set out on his expedition to India, and took Delhi, having then an army of near 100,000 horse. But finding a general conquest of India would be attended with much difficulty, be bent his thoughts on an expedition against the Turks, and three years and eight mouths after the taking of Delhi, he retired from Hindostan. The death of Mahmud, in 1413, put an end to the Patan dy nast}'. He was succeeded by Chizer, a Seid ; that is, one of the race of the impostor Muhammed ; and his posterity continued to fill the throne till the year 1450 ; when Belloli, an Afghan ofthe tribe of Lodi, took possession of it, on the abdication of Alia II. At this time all Hindostan fell into separate governments. A con. siderable part of the empire, however, was recovered by the son of Belloli who in 1501, fixed his residence at Agra."], [153, "APPENDIX. 123 During the reign of Ibrahim II.

He on his succession, assumed the title of Jehau-Guire, or Lord of the World, and reigned twenty-two years and ten months, with much more reputation and success than could have been expected from so weak a prince. Under him the conquest of the Deccan was . but faintly pursued. The rebellions ofthe emperor's son, Shah-Jehan, embittered the latter part of his reign, and the influence of his favourite sultana, Noor- Jehan perplexed the couucils of the nation. Her abilities were extraordinary ; for she rendered herself absolute, in a government iu which women are thought incapable of bearing any part. In the year 1615, Sir Thomas Roe, the first English ambassador to the court of Hindostan, arrived at Agimere, where Jehan-Guire then kept his court. Sir Thomas was received by the emperor with the utmost kindness. The presents made by the ambassador were agreeable to him ; but a fine coach sent by King James pleased him most of all. In the month of January, 1615, a firman was obtained for the establishment of an English factory at Surat. Seven children were born to the emperor Jehan-Guire ; five sons and two daughters. The sons were Chusero, Purvez, Chur rum (afterwards Shah-Jehan), Jehandar and Shariar. Chusro, Purvez, aud Jehandar died before their father ; Shariar fell a victim to his brother's jealousy ; and Shah-Jehan succeeded to the empire. The prince Chusero left his two sons, Dawsir Buxsh and Gurshap, who were both murdered at the instance of Sha- Jehan. The children of Purvez were a son and daughter; the first, by dying a natural death, prevented the danger of Shah- Jehan from committing another murder ; and the latter became the wife of Dara, the eldest son of Shah-Jehan. The two sons of Danial, Baiesar aud Hoshung, had been confined during the reign of their uncle, Jehan-Guire. Strangers to the world, their nerves were relaxed by inactivity and their minds broken by adversity. * Dow."], [156, "126 APPENDIX. This state of debility did not secure them from the jealousy of the new emperor, by whose command they were strangled at Lahore. Shah-Jehan, as was observed in a note, either by the dagger or bowstring dispatched all the males of the house of Timour ; so that he .himself and his children only remained of the posterity of Baber who conquered India. It was in the year 1628 that Shah Jehan mounted tho throne ofthe Moguls ; and, according to the pompous manner of eastern provinces, assumed the title of The True Star of the Faith, The Second Lord of The Happy Conjunctions, Muhammed The King ofthe World. He was born at Lahore on the 5th January, 1562, and on the day of his accession, he was thirty-six years old. In this reign the Deccan was invaded by immense armies, and most of the princes of that countiy submitted to the Mogul. Gol conda was partially conquered, but little or no impression was made by the arms of Shah-Jehan on the kingdom of Visiapour or on the Carnatic. Casim, Governor of Bengal, having complained to the emperor that the Portuguese, who had established themselves at Hoogly on the Ganges had committed acts of violence upon the subjects of the empire, Shah-Jehan wrote to him in these laconic terms : \" Expel the idolaters from my dominons.\" Casim appeared with an army before the Portuguese factory and carried the place by assault. These were the first hostilities against Europeans recorded in. the histories of the east. The melancholy conse quences of the capture of Hoogly are detailed by Bender, accord ing to Colonel Dow, three thousand Portuguese fell into the hands of the Moguls. Though the power of Shah-Jehan had, in a great measure, terminated with the sickness, which, as we have seen in Bernier roused his sons to arms, mounted the throne. He held the sceptre of India thirty solar years and five months ; and when he was dethroned, he had attained the sixty-seventh year of his age. The means by which Shah-Jehan obtained the empire of the Moguls, were no moie justifiable than those which he so much blamed in Aureng-Zebe. He rebelled against his father, and he sacrificed his relations."], [157, "127 APPENDIX. In 1658 the civil wars, detailed by our traveller, commenced; and in 1660 Aureng-Zebe was in possession ofthe throne. From that period until the year 1678, profound peace prevailed in Hindostan. In the latter part of his reign he conquered the Deccan, to which Major Rennell supposes he was incited by the resolution and growing power of Sevajee, the founder of the Mahratta state; aud wdio, in that character, appear ed almost as a rival to Aureng Zebe himself* The emperor's persecutions of the Hindoos stirred up the Rajput tribes in Agi mere, and ho would have been taken prisoner, had not the enemy thought proper to allow him to escape. In 1681 he again attacked the Rajputs, aud destroyed Cheitore, the famous capi tal of the Rana, aud every where demolished the Hindoo temples ; but he was obliged to abandon his enterprise, and the Rajputs preserved their independence. After the tenth year of Aureng- Zebe's reign, w*e know very little of his transactions, as he would not allow any history of them to bo written. He died in 1707, in the 90th year of his age, leaving four sons ; Mauzum, afterwards emperor, under the title of Bahader-Shah ; Azem, Kam bukhsh, and Acbar,*who had fled to Persia thirty years before, on account of a rebellion in which he was engaged against his fa thers * The derivation of the Mahratta, is from Marhat, the name of a province in the Dec can, Sevajee, who play- so important apart iu the drama before us, may be considered us the founder of the Mahratta empire. His grandfather is supposed to have been ani illegitimate son of a Rana us Oudinnor, the chief of the Rajput princes. Having* after the death of his father (the Rana of Ouilipour) suffered some indignities from his bro ther?, on account of his birth, he retired to the Peccan and entered into the service of the King of Visiapour, who conferred on him a distinguished rank in his army. In this rank lie was succeeded by hi? son, but his giandsoh Sevajee, who was born in 1628, em braced au opportunity, which the distractions existing in tlie Visiapour monarchy afford edliim, of becoming independent. So rapid was the progress of his conquests chathe was grown formidable to the armies of the Mogul empire before Aurung Zebe's acces sion to power. At his death, in 1630, his domains extended from the northern part of Baglana, near Surat, to the neighbourhood ofthe Portuguese settlement of Goa, along the sea coast ; but probably not inland -, for Aurung Zebe's armies kept the field in Vi siapour at that period. His son Sambajee was treacherously seized on and cruelly put to death by Aurung Zebe in 1689. The Mahrattas continued, however, to increase in power. Sahoiflee succeeded \"his father Sambajee and-reigned more than fifty years. The confusions occasioned by the disputed succession among Aurung Zebe's children and their descendants opened a wide field to this hardy and enterprising people, at the time of Sahoojee's death. in 1740, the Mahratta state had swallowed up the whnle tract from the western sea to Orisa; and from Agra to the Carnatic t Auieug-Zebe left a will ; of which for the satisfaction of the curions, I shall give a translation. It is extracted from a work (The History of Nadir Shah) published by Mr. James Fraser, in the year 1742. \" I came empty-handed into the world, and empty-handed I quit it. Whoever of my fortunate children shall chance to rule the empire, let him not molest Mahummud Kara buksh,* should he rest contented with the two new Soubahs.T * Muhammed Kambnksh, Aurung Zebe's youngest son. r The two new Soubahs are Visiapour and Hyderabad, so called as being lately con quered by Auiuiig Zebe."], [158, "128 APPENDIX. The soeds which produced the decay of the Mogul Empire, and which in our day have ripened into such malignancy, took a deep root during the reign of Aureng-Zebe ; who though one of the most sagacious of the house of Timour, endangered the welfare of the state and the security of his subjects by an injudicious impulse of domestic affection. He portioned among his sons the most va luable provinces of the empire ; where acquiring an influence and strength that cannot be held by au Asiatic subject with safety to the monarch, they expected with impatience the event that was to determine their schemes and pretensions. On the death of Aureng-Zebe, the sons eagerly took up arms, and after deluging the country with blood, the war was successfully terminated by Bahader-Shah, who may be said to have mounted the throne from a mound of fraternal and kindred slaughter. Not being endowed with the genius of his father, the goveruois of provinces relaxed in their allegiance during his short reign of five years. The Mahrattas, whom Aureng-Zebe had nearly subdued, descend ed at his death from their mountains, and rapidly recovered the territories from which they had been expelled. Previously to tho Persian invasion in the year 1738, the subadars of Oude and the Deccan, having virtually erected their chicfships into indepen dent states, commanded without the control of the court large armies. The empire thus enfeebled, invited Nadir Shah to con quest aud plunder. The river Attock, the natural western bar rier of India, on whose bank Muhammed-Shah, the then emperor, should have stood in person, was crossed by the Persians without opposition ; and this ' inglorious prince surrendered to them, without drawing his sword, the wealth and dominions of Hindos- \u25a0' There cannot be a better vizier than Emir-ol-Omrah. \u25a0' Let all tne king's servants be true and faithful to Muhammed Azem Shah* \u2022' Whoever shall chance to have the empire let him not hart or molest those born or br\\d up in my house. \"If the division I formerly made proves agreeable to my children, it will prevent a great deal of confusion and bloodshed. \"There are two imperial seats, Agra and Delhi; whoever settles in Agra may have the province thereof, Deccan Malava, and Guzerat, and who resides at Delhi may have Cabul aud other provinces. \" 1 came naked into the world, and naked I go out of it.

A subsequent train of diversified ruin, moving with a rapidity not paralleled in the history of nations, has now left scarcely a vestige ofthe Mogul Empire.* Under Aureng-Zebe' s reign, the empire attained its full mea- sure of exteot. His authority reached from the 10th to the \u00a3jth degree of latitude, aud ne irly as much in longitude ; and his revenue exceeded thirty two-millions of pounds sterling, in a country where tbe products of the earth are about four times as cheap as in England. t CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE OF EMPERORS WHO HAVE REIGNED IN HINDOSTAN, SINCE THE GHIZNIAN CONQUEST.

Beyond this is a cleared space which indicates the direction ofthe future railway. At present, a small Roman Catholic Chapel is on the right hand side of the road.

The explosion to be effected here at daybreak was to be the signal for a simultaneous advance of the three columns.

Home and his party w*ere at this outer gate almost before their approach was knowu. It was open ; but the draw bridge so shattered that it was very difficult to cross ; however they got over, reached the main gate, and laid their bags unharmed. \" So utterly paralysed,\" says Lieutenant Medley, t \" were the enemy at tho audacity of the proceeding, that they only fired a few straggling shots, and made haste to close the wicket with every appearance of alarm, so that Lieutenant Home, after laving bis bags, jumped into the ditch unhurt. It was now Salkeld's turn. He also advanced with four other bags of powder, and a lighted port-fire.

The darkness to which they had trusted for a surprise had passed away, and the day had broken when they moved out, each from its cover, in solid advance to the assault. A shower of grape from the flanking guns of both bastions, and a perfect sleet of musketry, greeted them, and many a gallant fellow fell before the glacis was reached. At the edge of the ditch there was a check ; the fire was so terrific that man after man was knocked over before the ladders could be got down into the ditch, which were to help them up the opposite side. The ladders once down, the men sprang in, mounted the scarp, scraml iled up over the debris of the crumbled wall, and were on the breach. Ever foremost in daring, Nicholson, iu advance of his men, was the first on the wall, at the head of his part of the column : Major Jacob, Captain Creville, and other officers ofthe Fusiliers, were the next moment by his side ; the other portion, with the 75th in advance, diverged a litle to the right to escalade the adjoining bastion; here a brave young officer of the corps, Lieutenant Fitzgerald, was the first to mount, and fell mortally wounded. A lodgment was now 'effected, and in spite of a fire from the Church, the Kutcheree, the Government College, and even the Selim Gurh fort in the distance, which raked the top of the wall, they stood firm : resistance was in vain ; the rebels were hurled back, or fled on every side ; and, running down the ramp, the whole column were under shelter of the Main Guard, where they re-formed. The 2nd column to the left had also carried the breach at the Water Bastion, though not without heavy loss.

However, \" English pluck\" triumphed; on the column pushed ; the ditch was crossed, the scarp mounted, and the breach carried in gallant style. r The three assaulting columns had now fiiily effected a lodgment within the walls ; and a call was made on Brigadier Longfield to bring up his reserve, in order to occupy the positions as they were taken, thus leaving the columns free to push on. Colonel Campbell first moved Ids column out ofthe Main Guard, and diverged to the left to clear the Kutclieree and' church, while General Nicholson, having re-formed, filed past his rear to the light, and entered the narrow lane called tlie Rampart Road, which runs the whole oircuifc of the city within the wall. Such a line of advance was evidently never anticipated by the rebels ; for with the exception of the -riflemen on the ramparts, scarcely a man was here to dispute their progress. They soon cleared the ramparts, and, with very slight loss, carried the Moree Bastion, and also the Cabul Gate, and were pressing on towards the Lahore Gate, their point d'appui, which they were to open from inside for the 4th column, under Major Reid-* They had gone on some distance, H.M. 75th intront, when at a curve in the road, a gun on the Burn Bastion opened fire{upon them ; in the lane, too, was a slight breastwork with a brass gun to dispute the road ; but this was soon withdrawn before the brisk fire of the 75th. |Unhappily norush was made to capture it .* the men in advance hesitated, and fell back to the Cabul Gate, with three officers,- \u2014 Captain Freer (of the 27th), Wadeson, and Darrell \u2014 wounded.

In spite of a heavy musketry-fire playing on them from adjoining houses,' thay yet held on, hoping succour mightjcome up : at length, when Colonel Campbell learnt that Nicholson had not gained the Lahore Gate, and that the rebels were mustering strong in the Chandnee Chouk, finding his men falling fast, and himself slightly wounded seeing no hope of support, he resolved to fall back, and drew off his men to the church. In the meanwhile a noble struggle had been going ou in the Chandnee Chouk. Major Ram say, with his Goorkhas (Kumaon Batalion) and about 100 ofthe 52d L. I., had been detached by Colonel CampbeU to push up the street aud seize the Cotwallee. They carried their point in gallant style, and fearing to be cut off, fell back to the main column, leaving a few men to hold the building. Three times did they clear the road and the adjoining houses ; and for some five hours the Kotwallee was in their hands ; but Major Ramsay, also finding himself without support, and afraid to risk the dan ger of so isolated a position, was compelled to abandon it and join Colonel Campbell at the Church. The reserve column under Brigadier Longfield had from the first been broken up to meet the demands of the assaulting columns ; the whole of the 60th Rifles, under Colonel Jones, had distributed themselves along the line of advance to cover * Bourchier's battery was lyine outside ready, and as soon as jj^ bridge aDd gateway admitted of it, in it came, and did noble service."], [183, "151 THE ASSAULT. ver's edge \u2014 which did such terrible execution on the walls not a vestige remains ; and a neat soldier's garden is trim- the attacking columns ; while the Belooch Battalion was first thrown into the advanced batteries, and subsequently sent to the support of Reid's column to the right. On the assaulting columns advancing, H.

Such was that day's work within the city, thus summed up in the official telegraphic message at half-past two o'clock, \" We hold the line of the city from the Cabul Gate to the College Gar dens.\" It only remains to descsibe the progress of the 4th column, whose work lay on the extreme right. The policy of an attack upon this point at all has been sometimes questioned, as em bracing too large a range of assault. It has been urged that the troops concentrated here, if distributed over the other columns, would by the increase of numbers have made tho ad vance at the other points more vigorous, and the success more certain and complete. In this there may be some truth ; but, on the other bond, it is only just to consider that the advance of numerically* the largest column of this quarter was not with out its object : it served as a feint, confirming the rebels in their expectation that the main attack would be here, and thus drawing off their attention from the other points of assault. It has been sometimes hinted, too, that the General was greatly deceived as to the strength of the enemy in the Kissengunge, that he had been led to believe them to be in no great force there, and that they could be easily mastered ; to which it may be replied, that though possibly the exact strength of the enemy in this strong position was uot actually known, still so much was known, that they were a formidable body, and that their loca tion here was not without its object, that object being to turn the flank, attack the rear, master the camp, and murder all the * Though a very large proportion were the Cashmere Contingent."], [184, "152 THE ASSAULT. med, out on the spot once the theatre of such wproarj excite ment and truimph. sick and wounded while the army were engrossed in the assault ! So that the advance of this column on Kissengunge, though unsuccessful, did effect its twofold object \u2014 it acted as a. feint, and it saved our rear and camp. At the appointed hour all the troops told off to compose this column, 50 men ofthe 60th B-ifles, 160 of the 1st Fusiliers, with 200 of the Sirmoree Goorkhas, and 200 Guides, and the Crow's Nest picquet drawn in, 80 of H.

Gist Regiment, 65 Kumaon Battalion, and 25 Coke's Rifles with the Cashmere Contingent, formed up behind the Goorkha stronghold, Hindoo Rao's house, and then moved down the hill to the main road, close to the advanced picquet in the Subzoe Mundee, where they were dis posed by Major Reid for the attack ; three guns were also at tached to this column, but there was eonsiderable delay in their arrival, and when they did arrive, they were so deplorably under manned as to be of little use.* Two Engineer officers, Lieute nants Maunsell and Tennant, accompanied this column. The enemy had occupied the Kissengunge Serai in great force, planting two strong batteries in front, and running out two breastworks with light field-pieces across the road leading up to it, one a short distance from the wall, the other far in advance, close to the canal bridge. Major Reid's plan was, after carrying the first breastwork, to divide his column into two parts, and, branching off with one half on each side, to push ou in parallel lines to the flanks of the batteries and the serai, making at the same time a feint on their front ; and then, having carried the guns and cleared the building, to make for the Lahore Gate. From the unfortunate delay in the arrival of the guns, it was now broad daylight : not only was surprise no longer possible, but their intention was known, and reinforcements were seen pouring in to the rebel position from the Lahore Gate. While all was being prepared for the advance, firing was suddenly heard on the right. It was the Cashmere Contingent, who for some cause were prematurely engaging the enemy.

The whole i plan of attack was now disconcerted \u2014 the heavy guns from the \u25a0 rebel batteries swept the road with grape ; the Cashmere Con tingent on the right, finding the enemy far more numerous than they expected, gave way, and could not again be brought up ;* any further attempt was hopeless, and it only remained to draw off. the. rest ofthe column with as little loss as might be, which was effected by Captain Muter ofthe 60th Bifles, who succeeded to the command ou Major Bcid being wounded.

These were concentrated by tho sjde of B.rind's battery on the right, so as to prevent any flank movement on the assaulting columns. They gradually moved down towards the city walls, and came close under the Moree Bastion, and were for some time most critically placed, suffering heavy loss from the, grape and musketry of the rebels. Their post was perhaps the most trying of the whole force on that day : without any of the thrilling excitement of the assault, they were compelled to hold their ground for some three hours, a stationary target for the enemy, losing men every instant, vet unable to avenge the deaths of their fallen comrades ; until at length, the lodgment fairly effected in the city by the other columns, they were enabled to retire from their exposed position, . bearing with them, alas ! a heavy though honourable roll of wounded. . . * The native commandant.

The city lies on the right bank of the Jumna 120 miles above Outside the palace, on the river-side, stands Selim t/urh. Tho main entrance to this fort is a gateway of some pretensions, close to the bridge of boats. Until a few years ago, this was a closed gate ; the successive kings of Delhi had frequently solicited from the English Government that ingress and egress through Selim gurh might bo granted to them, as saving them the inconveni ence of passing through the crowded streets of the city, when ever they wished to enjoy a little country air. The request had long been steadily refused ; but a few years ago, it was conceded, it being thought that no possible evil could result from so tri fling a privilege. However, it proved otherwise. It was by tho means of this very gate through Selimgurh Hint a few ofthe foremost troopers obtained an entrance into the palace, and, to the old King's surprise and indignation, presented themselves under the windows of the private female apartments, vociferously demanding of him to take his place at their head. Here it was that Captain Douglas had found them on his visit to the King, and had vainly endeavoured to pacify them.

One of the menial; of the palace rushed at him, tulwar in hand, as he stood at the foot, of the stairs, and cut liim down., The Rubicon was now crossed; three Molrimmedan retainers in the palace sprang forward and wreaked their frenzy in gashes on his fallen body, then rushed up the stairs to seek the other ob jects of their hate. They found Captain Douglas, Mr Jennings and the two ladies, in one room, aud Mr. 'Hutchinson in au ad joining one, and murdered them all. Four months after, when the blood-stained city was once mor\u00abr in our hands, were still to be traced the stains of blood, which, told their tale of horror. More troopers had by this time reached the palace gate, and, finding how matters had progressed here, rode on to that' part of the city called Dariao Gauge.

At the Delhi Bank fell Mr. Beresford, the manager, with all his family, after a gall'int and desperate resistance The young assistant at the telegraph office who had taken Mr. Todd's place, and whose last message electri fied and warned the Punjab, was cut down with his hand on the signalling apparatus. \u25a0 Succours were in the meantime hastening in from cantonment* destined, however, as it proved, to increase rather than suppress tbe tumult already raised in the city. As the 54th N. I., sent off at once by Brigadier Graves, reached the Cashmere Gate, they were met by a sepoy sent by Lieutenant Willoughby to report that the mob was beginning to get restless and turbulent, and that the magazine was threatened. Colonel Ripley gave the order to push on to the rescue. He had scarcely passed through the inner wooden gate of the main guard, and entered the open square beyond, when he was met by a party of the troopers, who dashed down at once upon him. So little prepared for such an emergency weie the colonel and the other officers, that they ap pear to have been marching together at the head of the regiment. The Colonel ordered his men to load, but they paid no heed. They at once joined and fraternised with the mutineers who fired off their pistols with fatal effect on the officers of the 54th N. I. Colonel Ripley, was left for dead : but though wounded in seventeen places (some from the bayonets of his -own men), he contrived, as the troops now in open mutiny dispersed for pro miscuous carnage and plunder, to drag himself to the wooden gate inside the main gimrd : here he was found by Dr. Stewart the garrison surgeon, who had him carried outside the Cashmero Gate, placed in Mr Le Bas' carriage, which was standing there and took him at once up to cantonments. We now turn to cantonments. The Brigadier, on despatching the 54th N. I. to the city, made such arrangements as were pos sible for the safety of station.

The guard of the magazine* was stre ngthened from its usual complement of twenty men under a native officer, to a subaltern's guard of a hundred men. Firing was soon heard in the city ; them came rolling up that bumming sound, like distant thunder, which told of a multitude in commotion ; and flames were soon seen rising up from dif ferent parts of the city, especially in the quarter where Govern ment offices and private houses stood. It now become evident that a great crisis was at hand. \\Vliile throwing what troops he could spare into the city, it became ne cessary for the brigadier to provide still further against the pos sibility of an attack on cantonments. Every one at all acquaint ed with Delhi knows well the round castellated building crown ing the ridge that separates the cantonments from the city; this Flag-staff Tower, as it was called, was fixed on as the only post at all capable of defence. Here it might be possible to bold out for a few hours at least, provided no guns were brought against them ; still, with no supply of water, no provisions at hand, nor any means of cooking-, it would be a forlorn hope. Here, however, it was decided that all the ladies and families of the station, with the many fugitives who were already flocking in from the civil lines and the city, should collect together, for weak and exposed as the position was, there was every reason to hope that, with so strong a European force near at hand at Meerut, only a few hours could elapse before they would be extricated. Here, therefore, they took up their position, a black * This, the main powder-magazine, must not be confounded with the expense Magazine inside the city walls, which was subsequently blown up.

Carriages and horses were standing close by ; the heat was very great. Most of the children were crying ; and no wonder, for they were hungry, thirsty, uncomfortable, and frightened. Many of the ladies were in a state of great despondency ; some, however, were as cool and collected as possible, never shedding a tear or uttering a complaint. Here an officer was haranguing the sepoys and endeavouring to persuade them to do their duty ; there, an anxious group was gathering round the brigadier, consulting and discussing.\"' There now only remained two guns of DeTeissier's Battery, and the 38th N. I., with a few ofthe 74th N. I. The two guns had been placed iu front of the Flag-staff Tower so as to sweep the road, which, branching off the main road, comes straight up the ascent, and also taking in flank the main road itself into cantonments. On the ridge along the right flank, about a couple of hundred of the 38th N. I., and some of the 74th N. I., were placed, aud the Christian band-boys of the-native corps were col- lected together close around the tower, with spare arms ajid am- munition brought from the regimental magazines placed in their hands ; while a further supply was stored inside the building- ready for use. It was noticed that about thirty or forty of the rifle company of the 38th were constantly mixing themselves up among the gunners to prevent the guns being worked. As a watch upon these worthies, two or three of the gentlemen inside placed them- selves on the top of the tower, aud, stood, musket in hand, ready to shoot down the first man who interfered with the gun- ners, or made any attack upou the officers. Inside the tower might be seen ladies, busy unfastening cartridges and loading muskets for the gentlemen. Asthe day advanced, the anxiety increased; all thoughts were turn ed towards Meerut, for the bearing of the sepoys was perceptibly changing. It was becoming too clear that in any attack they"], [196, "164 THE OUTBREAK AT DELHI MAT llTH 1857, whole defended by a ditch and a good glacis. The walls are built of stone and lime, and had been thoroughly repaired would join their brethern against their European masters, even if they did not commence tho attack themselves. A fine brave young fellow, named Marshall offered to ride to Meerut for succour. Brigadier Graves at once mounted him, and gave him a-letter to General Hewitt ; but he only got as far as the nullah by the side of the powder-magazine, when the 3Sth men on guard there shot him down when in the act of fording. Dr. Batson, the surgeon ofthe 74th N. I., then offered to go on the same errand, disguised as a native ; and with his face and hands stained, he started on this desperate, but as it proved equally fruitless venture. And what was passing all this time at tbe magazine ; The European staff of the magazine comprised only the following : \u2014 Lieutenant George Willoughby ofthe artillery, in command : Lieutenants G. Forrest aud W. Raynor, assistant commissaries of ordnance ; Conductors Buckley, Shaw and Scully ; Sub-Conduc- tor Crow, and Sergeants Edwards and Stewart. Such were the gallant little band that now prepared itself to defend the maga- zine by every means which, on the spur of the moment, it wat possible to devise, in the firm hope that succour would soon come from Meerut ; or, failing that, prepared to sell it with their lives, Sir Theophilus Mercalse's suggestion of moving out the two guns towards the bridge was at once found impracticable. There were neither cattle to draw them noi gunners, to work them.* Lieutenant Willoughby, as soon as he found the crowd gathering round and becoming tumultuous, had sent off a messenger for succour from the cantonments. This man met Colonel Ripley aud the 38th passing in at the main guard, Their fate we alrea- dy know*. The condition of the magazine was in the meanwhil* becoming more perilous.

So it became necessary to prep; re for the worst. Those preparations are thus described by Lieutenant Forrest himself : \" Inside the gate leading to the park we placed two 6-pounders double charged with grape, one under Acting Snb-Cbnductor Crow and Sergeant Steward, with the lighted matches in their hands, and with orders that, if any attempt was made to force the gate, both guns were to be fired at once, and they were to fall back on that part of the magazine in which Lieutenant Willoughby and 1 were posted. The prin cipal gate of the magazine was similarly defended by two guns, with the chevaux de frieze laid down on the inside. For the further defence of this gate and the magazine in its vicinity, there were two 6-pouuders so placed as both to command the gate and a small bastion in its vicinity. Within sixty yaids of the gate, and in front of the office, and commanding two cross roads, were three 6-pounders and one 24-pounder howitzer which could be so maneged as to act upon any part of the magazine in that neighbourhood. After all these guns and howitzeis bad been placed in the several positions above named, they were loaded with double charges of grape.\" Next followed preparations for the dernier resort \u2014 that act which will give to the name of the shy, reserved, modest, un pretending * subaltern of artillery, George Willoughby, a place in the roll of England's heroes.

From the main powder-store was laid a train to thefoot of a large lime-tree standing alone in the yard.t At the trunk of this tree was stationed Conductor Scully, with orders that when be saw Conductor Buckley raise his hat the train was to be fired.

The King had at first been taken by surprise ; the spirit of iasurrection which ho had evoked had broken out before the preconcerted time, The thought of the strong European garrison of Meerut, and of the dire retribution which might come from that quarter, made him cautious. He hesitated before compromising himself. Messengers were despatched on camels along the Meerut road, to give immediate intimation of the advance of any European force. About the middle of the day they returned to the palace, and reported that not a soldier was within twenty miles. The old King now took courage.* Another and a stronger guard was sent down, under a son and a grandson of the King to demand the immediate surrender ofthe magazine in the King's name. On this being refused scaling ladders were sent out from the palace and planted against the walls along the main road. Danger threatened also for another quarter. Under the south wall of the magazine stood the old Christian burial ground. The cepoys aud King's guard baffled in their attempts to effect an entrance at the gates, climbed up to the tops of these tombs, and from thence fired in upon the little garrison as they stood at their guns, and were unable to defend themselves against this new ene my.

Indeed, many of them crowded round the brigadier, and his brigade-major, who still remained behind, and urged them, in terms more earnest than respectful, to be off \u2014 \" this was no longer a place for them.\"* Before leaving, however, one more effort was made to blow up the powder-magazine. The importance of such a step was ap parent as soon as ever tlie real nature of the crisis began to be understood ; but unfortunately the brigadier's first precaution of strengthening the guard, now presented an insurmountable obstacle. Every attempt to get inside was in vain ; the guard, at once suspected the object, and had now too deep a personal interest in securing its contents to give a chance of destroying them. And so the magazine, with its vast stores of powder, was of necessity left in their hands. All the ammunition, however, which had been collected in the Flag-staff Tower was drenched with water, and thus rendered useless. It was now nearly sunset. All had dispersed, in carriages and bu\u00bbgies, on horseback and on foot, some hoping to reach Meerut, others Kurnal. The Brigadier, Captain Nicol], and Dr. Stewart alone remained, and they resolved to follow ; all hope of holding the place was gone, and every moment's delay needlessly hazard- Another anecdote may be here added, as illustrating the native opinion of the Eng lish character. One of the Dehli officers on returning there with the army, was surprised to find his old moorghee watluh (fowlmnn) walk into histei t and still more so to hear him say lie had come to nive him an account of his poultry, which were all safe he had taken care of them and fed them regularly, because, he said, \" he was sure his master would come back.\" * The different treatment received by Brigadier Graves from that which fell to the lot of m\"St commanding officers during the crisis, is worthy of notice, the more so as it of explanation. In the middle of April, several sepoys ofthe 16th N. I.

In the course of conversation (as he afterwards remembered), seme ofthenu almost with importunity urged him to go to England or the hills\u2014 at any rate, to leave Delhi, as being very hot and unhealthy.. Finding that he paid no heed to their remarks, they appear to have warned their brethren ofthe 38th that whatever might occur, the brigadier was not to be touched ; he was their old otficer. and they would hold the 88th responsible for his life.

The British Camp lay around the old Cantonments on the nortli side of the ridge which formed the great strength of the position.

Having shown the position of the two forces before the actual seige commenced ; it is requisite in order to complete the description, briefly to notice the points of attack as exhibited in the plan of operations. Such was the position of the camp with a force of all arms, Native and European under 5800 effective men to hold it. This force distributed to the best advantage could scarce ly cover one-sixth of the city walls. Our guns could only command two of the seven gates on the land side \u2014 the Cash mere and Cabul gates ; leaving the other five (among them the Lahore Durwaza, or Grand Trunk Road entrance to the city) wholly undisputed : while on the river side all was their own, the Jumna flowing up to the walls, and the bridge of boats, about 2500 yards from our nearest guns, giving undisturbed command of the whole Doab in supplies and reinforcements. The ammuntion, the magazine, was in their hands and constant accessions of rebels arrived. But the British Army once planted on the ridge by Sir H. Barnard,* never lost one inch of ground ; not a single position had been abandoned \u2014 not a single attack was made but was repulsed, however formidable. * Before describing the further advance ofthe Umballa force, it will be necessary to notice at some length events which were passing at Meerut. General Ansou, having acceded to the wishes of Sir John Lawrence, and at length consented to move upon Delhi, wrote to General Hewitt, commanding the Meerut division informing him of his proposed plan, and asking for reinforce ments from the Meerut brigade. \" I propose,\" he said, writing"], [205, "173 enmiKAL advance of bir h. barnard genl. wilson. on the 23rd of May, \"to advance with the column from Kur nal towards Delhi on the 1st of June, and be opposite to Bhag put on the 5th.

On the night of the 27th of May, the little brigade moved out binder Colonel Archd-ule Wilson, composed of balsa troop of horse artillery under Major Henry Tombs ; a cpmpapy of foot aitillery and light field battery under Major E.

Three marches were accomplished without obstacle or appearance of opposition ; and on the morn- ing of the 30th they encamped at Ghazee-eodeen-Nugger on the \u2022 banks of the Hiudon, a tributary stream ofthe Jumna, which here crosses the maiu road between Meerut aud Delhi, and is spanned by an iron suspension bridge. This most important point may be regarded as the key of the Doab. Here the rebels had come out in full force and had strongly intrenched themselves with the intention of disputing our advance ; yet so carefully had they concealed their position; that no suspicion was entertained of their proximity till late in the day. About four o'clock in the afternoon, two cavalry videttes galloped in and reported that the mutineers were advancing in force, accompanied by heavy guns a few minutes after, an 18 pound round shot rolled into camp.* In a few moments the whole force turned out ; and then began the first struggle with our rebel army. The plan of attack and the result are thus described by Brigadier Wilson : \u2014 \u00ab It took off one leg \"f each of two palkee-bearers who were sitting at the tent-door of lh\u00ab Carabineers, hospital\u2014 Kotton's Siege of Delhi, p. 24."], [206, "174 BATTLB 01 TH!

On the 4th of June they turned their backs on Ghazee-oo-deen- Nugg'ur aud the Hindon, having first rendered the bridge im passable, without having seen anything more of the rebels since the 31st.

On the morning of the 7th oocurred an incident which fur nished another illustration of the value of Lieutenant Hodson in the force. The evening before there had been grave doubts and differences among the Staff as to the real position which the rebels had taken up to dispute our advance on Delhi. The camp was then at Alipore, covered by a strong advance-guard of all arms, with a breastwork thrown up across the road, and a couple of guns, loaded with grape, aud port-fires burning. As the day dawned, a small cloud of dust was noticed ahead on the road from Delhi : all were on the alert ; on it came, nearer and nearer it was evidently cavalry It was within three hundred yards \u2014 a few yards more, and the guns would have opened upon them \u2014 when the foremost of the party turned off sharp to the right, followed by about a dozen sowars. It was an Englishman \u2014 it was Hodson !

Brigadier Hallifax had died of congestion of the brain and Colonel St. G* Showers had succeeded to the command of the 1st Infantry Brigade. Colonel Mowat, commanding the artillery, had been carried off by cholera, aud the command had been taken by Colonel Murray Mackenzie, ofthe Meerut force. All was now preparation for the coming struggle.

Such were the natural advantages of their position, which they had not been slow to take advantage of and to improve upon.

To such an extent had they turned to good account the time wdiich our delay in advancing had given them. The plan of attack may be briefly thus described : \u2014 The infan- try were to be divided into two brigades ; the first, commanded by Colonel St. G. Showers, consisted of nine companies of H. M. 7oth Foot under Colonel Herbert; the 1st Bengal Fusiliers under Colonel Welchman* witb Major Scott's battery ; cue squadron of Carabineers and a party of sappers (with intrenching tools) under Lieutenant Chesuey of the Bengal Engineers. The second brigade under Brigadier Graves, comprised six companies of the 60th Rifles under Colonel J. Jones, six companies of the 2nd Bengal Fusiliers under Captain A. Boyd, the Sirmoor battalion of Goorkhas under Major C. Reid, with Captain Money's troop of horse artillery, and a squadron of the 9th Lancers, accompanied by a party of sappers under Lieutenant Salkeld ofthe Engineers. The cavalry brigade, under Colonel J. Hope Grant, C. B, comprised three squadrons of tbe 9th Lancers under Lieutenant Colonel Yule, and about fifty of tho Jheend Horse under Lieutenant Hodson, with Tombs's and Tur ner's troops of horse-artillery. The entire force brought into the field may be calculated at in round numbers 170 cavalry and 1900 infantry, with fourteen guns in the two infantry brigades, and iu that under Brigadier Hope Grant, about 350 cavalry aud ten guns ;t while theie re- mained behind, aia rear guard, and to protect tho siege train, a squadron of the Cth Carabineers, a company of the 2nd Bengal Fusiliers, two guns of Major Scott's battery and the Jheend Ra jah's contingent.

This part was assigned to the cavalry brigade ; and while it was still dark, Brigadier Hope Grant moved off his cavalry and guns, with the view of making a detour and presenting himself on tho left rear of the enemy simultaneously with the infantry brigades in his front. / Soon after two o'clock in the morning the whole force was on tho move. A march of five miles brought them close upon the enemy's position ; the day was just breaking and lights were seen in tho enemy's camp. While our guns were in the act of ad vancing, the enemy forestalled them and opened fire. Tho second brigade were still two miles in the rear when they heard the booming of the cannon ; for, through some mismanagement, store-carts and cattle had so blocked up the road as to obstruct their march. But, once clear of these impedimenta , they pushed on at the double,' and soon formed up in their position. In tho meanwhile the heavy guns of the enemy\u2014 for our light field pieces could do little towards silencing the 18 and 2.4-pounders they had brought jOut from the magazine \u2014 were playing with deadly effect on the advancing column. To add to the discom fiture some-body, no one knows who, called out to \" prepare for cavalry,\" and the 75th formed into square * so the round-shot was ploughed murderously through their closed ranks. Brigadier Showers saw the mistake, but there was no time to remedy it : so galloping to their front, he led them up, in square as they were, to the batteries. On they sprang with an English cheer, and the 1st Fusiliers, nobly came up in support, and the guns were mastered. Brigadier Graves had by this time brought up his column, and by a slight flank-movement, leading his men under heavy fire up to their knees in water, completed the capture. Now appeared the long-looked- for cavalry brigade. They had met with more difi&ulties and obstacles than they anticipated but they arrived just in time to soe the batteries 'taken, and by a dashing and murderous charge upon tho rebels completed tho route. The whole affair had scarcely lasted au hour ; yet it was no easy victory.

At their guns, too, they fought desperate ly \u2014 still more so inside the Serai ; hand to hand they fought for they knew there was no quarter for them ; and they sold theij lives dearly. It was said that of those who came out of Delhi a thousand never returned ; they must have lost in killed and wouuded between 400 and 500, and at least as many more had already tasted enough of the fruits of mutiny, and slunk off to their homes. About half a mile beyond, at Azadpoor, the road divided, the right branch leading to the eity, that on the left into canton ments ; so judiciously had the rebels taken up their first posi tion in advance of this division ofthe roads. Here a halt was sounded. About a couple of miles beyond rose the ridge where the rebels had apparently taken up another strong position. A short halt sufficed, and on they pushed again. Our force was altogether too small for a combined attack in front of the whole length of the ridge, so it was resolved to make a double flank attack on either end, and to effect a junction in the centre. So two columns were formed. Brigadier Grave's brigade, with the addition of Captain Money's troop of horse-ar tillery, took the left road towards the cantonments, while Briga dier Showers led his brigade, to which were attached tbe rest of the artillery and cavalry, to the right, along the road to the city, Major C.

Delhi, as a residence for Europeans, has generally been considered unhealthy ; but before the outbreak ofthe mutiny in 1S57, the troops of the station were all quartered outside tlie city. The old cantoument was situated to the north of the Del hi Ridge. Beyond it was a swampy plain extending as far as Alipore, (10 miles.) By the overflowing of the Jumna, this track of country be came one entire morass. The return of the water to its chan nel was impossible, from the western banks of the river be ing higher than the surrounding country, and moreover, the outlet of the canal at Alipore, instead of beino earned into the Jumna, was allowed to have direct communication with the swamp alluded to. Thus the whole sweep of country was often under water until the end of April. Alipore .1 heel bore west to noith-West from the old can tonments. The unhealthy season there was during the fourth quarter of the year, when it is to be remarked, a north-west wind invariably brought sickness with it. The villages near the Jheel, and Alipore itself were noto riously unhealthy. Thus is the insalubrity of the old cantonment to be ac counted for. Some have attributed it to the Nujjuffghur Jheel \u2022 but this had probably nothing to do with it. In the first place because it is between ten and fifteen miles distant, and lies iS. W. from Delhi ;\u2014 secondly, because the Jheel does not seem to cause sickness at Goorgaon, although that station is only two and-a-half miles from the Jheel, in an easterly direction, so as to be much exposed to the direct effects of the east wind blowing across it."], [216, "APPENDIX. METEOEOLOGIC. Between the cantonment and the city is the now famous Ridge, which slopes away to the north-west. Now this ridge forms a natural barrier of protection to the city, and one ofgrre-ort' value, as it seems to be sufficient to divert the malaria arising from the swampy country beyond it. Thus it happens that while the old cantonment was un doubtedly very unhealthy, (and also part ofthe district, par ticularly Alipore and portions of the track of the Western Jumna Canal), Delhi itself has, as a rule, been healthy above the average of large Indian cities. In 1844, and again in in 1854, fever was unusually pre- valent, and many residents suffered ; but when treated early it did not prove either intractable- or dangerous. Dr. Balfour was of opinion that the difference in salubrity between the north and south of the ridge was at least, as 3 to 1 in .favor ofthe city side. Delhi is S00 feet above the level of the sea, and lies in Lat. 28 deg. >39 min. ; Lon. 77 cleg, IS min. Careful observations on the Rain fall of Delhi were kept bv Dr. Balfour, Civil Surgeon of , the station, from 1S40 to The greatest fall in any sinfe month appears to have been in July 1855, when 14'46 inches were registered. The greatest fall in, 24 hours was 5.32 inches, which oc- curred cm the I Oth of J une 1853.

Delhi' may be regarded as a ra ther aiid district ; the fall of rain in 1842 is reported to have been only ten inches. That year, however, was considered a very dry one, even more so than 1837, in which the defici ency of rain was proiiu stive of dreadful famine.\" During the rainy season of 1SG0 only 7 inches of rain fell. The result of this as is well known was the late terrible famine, during the continuance of which upwards of 19,000 persons were fed in the different poor houses and relieving places of Delhi.
