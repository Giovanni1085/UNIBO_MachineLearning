Let the Reader be here requested to observe the distinction between \"killed,\" and \" wounded \" or \"falls : \" and that, therefore, he who may undertake to write a poem entitled \" The Pleasures of Peace ; \" and to introduce therein the Survivors of the Dramatis Person\u00e6 in this Tragedy ; need not exclude any one saving the King, Fabricius, and Cali. That there is no novelty in such a suggested addition to the Drama may be shown by it being stated that, in pp. xn, xin, of Preface to Ed. 1815, it is written : \"The Author feels that no one, judging from experi ence, will blame him for making the catastrophe unhappy. It entered, indeed, very readily into his original design to render the virtuous triumphant at last : but he soon found that the usual limitation of five acts, however extended, would be but a bare allowance for misery ; and he, therefore reluctantly gave up the attempt : not, however, without contemplating, with much pleasure, the accomplishment of his object, at some future quiet period, by adding another poem, under the title of The Pleasures of Peace \u2014 Peace in large an acceptation as it has been shown Anarchy was designed to be understood. \" But why should the Author mention his designs, unless it be to relieve the press from the apprehension of groaning under them ? The Pleasures of Peace, once, considered an easy and agreeable task, must be consigned to other historians, and bards, of Terra Incognita, as a subject which he feels himself entirely incapable of ever attempting ! \""], [12, "DRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6.

Alas ! my child, though to the rebel camp I go no more ; nor seek to gain those walls ; Yet we must henceforth leave our cot to others.

Matilda. So that with thee We fly, the rest will seem but light to me. Julia enters, running and singing. Jonathan. Go, and supply her place\u2014 so soon a truant ? Julia. [Taking hold of the harp. I am not yet in fault. There is the harp :"], [105, "93 A DRAMATIC POEM. She says a tune may lull here to repose. Do, sister, play her one. Jonathan. Then do, my child. Julia. Do, sister, for her heart seems much distress'd. [Exit. Matilda. What shall I play, my father, to appease A troubled mind ? Jonathan. If you will choose the one You did this morn, methinks 'twill ease my own. [Jonathan sits down by the fire-side ; Matilda plays. A lighted torch is icaved past the window. Matilda. [Suddenly stopping. Father ! Jonathan. My child ! Matilda. Did you not hear a voice ? What was that light that flash'd across my eyes ?"], [106, "94 THE PLEASURES OF ANARCHY, Jonathan. I saw no light ; I heard no voice \u2014 go on Matilda. [Plays, but stops again. But, sure, you hear the wind how it now roars ! Perhaps it was the lightning that I saw ; But then I heard a voice mix'd with the wind, I'm sure I did. \u2014 You said that none are safe : Can there be now the plunderers at the door ? Jonathan. The plunderers, child ! have I alarm'd you so ? Strange, should they come whilst we inhabit here.

Then it is time To rise, and see who there may be without ; Some other feeble wanderer who has lost Her way, amidst these wild and rugged roads ; Some other guest, perhaps, who shelter seeks From the so boist'rous tempest yet encreasing ; And having faintly knock'd fears to do more.

When those who stand in need do seek relief, 'Tis fit to give it them ; but charity Stops not thereat. It finds its objects out. [Jonathan shuts the door against the blast; and, whilst he looks for his staff and hat, a voice is heard along with a knock at the door. Malilda. Heard you that knock and voice ? Jonathan. Some one is there ! [Old Jonathan opens the door and admits Vulpes, who stares anxiously around the room ; but, seeing no one beside Old Jonathan and Matilda, grows calm; and points to some old arms hang- ing against the wall. Vulpes. A soldier do I see : He'll e'en relieve a brother-soldier's wants ? Jonathan. Ah, that he will : here take a seat : there's food, If hunger presses : or, if sleep's required, A chimney corner is a bed of down To him who has been used to sleep in swamps, On the bleak heath, or never sleep at all, Or to be roused just when his nap began. But you should have a better, if I had it."], [108, "96 THE PLEASURES OF ANARCHY, A feebler guest now occupies yon room. Come, do refresh yourself.

That noble cause ! \u2014 Vulpes. Ah, for my King, I mean. I am not used to mince my words through fear Of any rebel whom the land contains. I fought just by my King, and closed my eyes \u2014 Perhaps he closed his at the very time : For, in the morn, when I did wake again As if from sleep, 'twas silence all around ;"], [109, "97 A DRAMATIC POEM.

Jonathan. My valiant countryman, come, cheer you up. Our monarch lives ! I heard it but an hour Or two ago ; and, that you may be sure What side I take, I had three boys myself Who fell with you ; or fight now by his side. Vulpes. [Coughs. Three boys P Jonathan, I sent them long since to the walls. [Julia enters, and seems to reprove her sister for not playing. Matilda gives her a sign to be silent : they then both listen attentively. Vulpes. Had three, and sent them all ? Jonathan. All three. [ Vulpes coughs Vulpes. Well done ! [Coughs. H"], [110, "98 THE PLEASURES OF ANARCHY, Jonathan.

There is the wound where you now place your hand ? [Jonathan looks steadfastly again at Vulpes, for a few moments ; then leans his elbow on the chair, ha ring his hand on his forehead. In this defence- less posture he remains awhile in deep thought, then cries : O for my memory now ! [Suddenly, Vulpes draws out his dagger and stabs Old Jonathan, who falls writhing on the ground. His daughters shriek. Matilda bends over him as if distracted ; Julia throws herself as if dead beside him. The Queen rushes in alarmed.
